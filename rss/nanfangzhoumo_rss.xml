According to public information from the Shanghai Housing Administration, they spent 1.76 billion yuan to purchase it in 2020, which was the fourth anniversary of TST&#39;s establishment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Ruiyang was a Taiwanese artist, and later co-founded the micro-business beauty brand TST Ting Mi with his wife Zhang Ting. This brand has been questioned by suspected pyramid schemes in the past. Until April 2021, Shijiazhuang Yuhua The District Market Supervision and Administration Bureau applied to the court to freeze the huge property of a secretly affiliated company of the TST Tribunal on the grounds of suspected pyramid schemes. Only then did the outside world confirm that it was under investigation for suspected pyramid schemes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Right now, from the perspective of the secret side of the TST court, the outcome of the case has vindicated it. So, is it suspected of being a pyramid scheme? Why did the court unfreeze their property? Multiple documents obtained by Southern Weekend reporters provide the answer. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;There is indeed a pyramid scheme&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Is there a pyramid scheme in TST Court Secret? The answer is yes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An administrative penalty decision from the Baokang County Market Supervision and Administration Bureau of Hubei Province gave a clear answer: &quot;The Baokang County Municipal Supervision Bureau believes that... the bonuses implemented by the parties for red card members The system requires the person being developed to develop other personnel to join, form an upline and downline relationship, and calculate and pay upline remuneration based on the sales performance of the downline, which belongs to the following behaviors in Article 7, Item (3) of the &quot;Prohibition of Pyramid Selling Regulations&quot;, and is MLM behavior&#39;&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person involved here is Shanghai Dalwei Trading Co., Ltd., the owner of the TST secret brand, and its legal representative is Lin Jirong. This is the real name of &quot;eldest brother&quot; Lin Ruiyang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The signing date of this administrative penalty letter is September 3, 2021. That is, as early as two years ago, TST Court Secret had been identified as a pyramid scheme and was punished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to relevant national laws and regulations, pyramid schemes are divided into two situations, one is operational pyramid schemes and the other is fraudulent pyramid schemes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Operational pyramid schemes are subject to administrative penalties by the market supervision department in accordance with the &quot;Regulations on Prohibition of MLM.&quot; It is only an illegal act. If there is no penalty of revoking the business license, you can continue to operate after accepting the administrative penalties and making rectifications and compliance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fraudulent pyramid schemes are a serious crime, which falls under the criminal law of organizing and leading pyramid schemes and must be prosecuted by the procuratorate. The main difference between the two is whether there are actual business activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This administrative penalty letter shows that the TST Tribunal secretly belongs to a commercial pyramid scheme. The pyramid schemes identified occurred in Shanghai Dalwei Trading Co., Ltd. from January 1, 2018 to July 2021, and the illegal gains were confiscated. And impose fines and require &quot;correction within a time limit.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, you can continue to operate after making changes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2022, the TST Tribunal secretly submitted an &quot;Application for Guidance and Evaluation on the Rectification of the Product Sales System of Shanghai Dalwei Trading Co., Ltd.&quot; to the Baokang County Market Supervision and Administration Bureau. It listed its rectification measures in detail and believed that &quot;the rectified product sales system is completely in line with normal business practices. There is no bonus method based on team salary, and it should not fall within the prohibited situations stipulated in the &quot;Prohibition of Pyramid Selling Regulations.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters compared the two bonus systems before and after the rectification, the April 2021 version and the February 2022 version, and found that the biggest difference is that there is no team salary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bonuses are divided into three parts: one is the sales discount bonus, the other is the batch difference bonus, and the third is the self-media education promotion bonus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first is the name of the form. It used to be called &quot;Ting Secret Dealer Bonus System-Red Card&quot;, but was later changed to &quot;Ting Live Member Discount Table&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sales discount bonus is mapped to the new table and becomes a &quot;discount&quot;. The difference is not big. This part is a commission for personal performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The biggest change is the discount difference, which is the past &quot;lot-to-retail bonus&quot;. This part is the commission for the team&#39;s performance. For example, the team sold a total of 10,000 yuan, of which 2,000 yuan was sold by the team leader himself. This part is commissioned based on personal performance. The remaining 8,000 yuan must be distributed with subordinates according to a certain proportion. This part is the team salary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The new rule after the rectification is that &quot;the difference between the sales discounts corresponding to members and their direct members will be accumulated in the form of points or vouchers on the platform or system. The company will ultimately formulate redemption rules and redeem products within a certain period of time. Or deduct the purchase amount (ranging from 2% to 24%).&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;self-media education promotion bonus&quot; that used to be extracted in proportion to the team&#39;s performance has now become a &quot;promotion service fee.&quot; The promotion service fee has added conditions for receiving it, requiring that &quot;the member&#39;s own live broadcast product performance is greater than 0 &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, the proportion of promotion service fees calculated based on team performance was between 4% and 5%, but now it is unified at 3%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After rectification, Tingmi believes that “Tingmi’s sales performance commissions are only generated for directly related superior members, and they are all one-time rewards and are not passed on.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This rectification report also received a reply from the local regulatory authorities, stating that &quot;our bureau will organize relevant personnel to conduct research in a timely manner.&quot; After that, TST Court Secrets has been operating normally. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;One thing cannot be punished twice&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is precisely because Baokang County, Hubei Province has secretly conducted an investigation into the TST Court on May 25, 2021. This made the Market Supervision Bureau of Yuhua District, Baoding City, Hebei Province, which only opened the case for investigation on June 5, 2021, passive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Administrative Punishment Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; has clear provisions, firstly, &quot;prior jurisdiction&quot;, and secondly, &quot;no penalty whatsoever&quot;. At the same time, the &quot;State Administration for Industry and Commerce on Further Improving the Investigation and Punishment of Online MLMs The Notice also clarifies the jurisdiction of online pyramid schemes cases, and the competent authority shall apply the principle of full jurisdiction over the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From this point of view, who has jurisdiction is the first issue that the two market regulatory authorities must resolve. Judging from subsequent developments, Baokang County, Hubei Province did not give up its jurisdiction and imposed penalties four months after the case was filed. The secret rectification of the TST Tribunal was also completed in February 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What really attracted widespread attention to this case was that on December 23, 2021, the Shijiazhuang Yuhua District Market Supervision Bureau announced in a reply to an inquiry letter that “because of its use of financial institutions to transfer or conceal the relevant To transfer the funds, our bureau has applied to the People’s Court to take preservation measures in accordance with the law.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, this application was supported by the Yuhua District Court, which froze 96 properties and 600 million yuan in cash secretly owned by the TST Court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This court ruling freezing property has been questioned by the industry. Yang Fan, the attorney representing the case, said on social media, &quot;How can the Yuhua District Market Supervision Bureau&#39;s application for court preservation be a civil ruling? The Yuhua District Market Supervision Bureau has not made any administrative decision in the past year. How can it be in the administrative agency? Are you going to apply for court preservation while the case is being investigated?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Bing, another attorney in the case and professor of administrative law, also publicly questioned on social media, &quot;Is this a civil pre-litigation preservation or a litigation preservation? The first preservation period was only 30 days, and litigation preservation was even more impossible. No one sued at that time or now, and it is impossible for the Market Supervision Bureau to be the plaintiff.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shijiazhuang Yuhua District Market Supervision Bureau stated in an interview with Upstream News that it had set up a task force and more than 400 law enforcement officers participated in the investigation. &quot;Currently, it appears to be a commercial pyramid scheme. Whether it has the characteristics of a fraudulent pyramid scheme is still under investigation.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Until July 26, 2023, the People’s Court of Yuhua District, Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province issued a civil ruling: “County and municipal-level industrial and commercial and market supervision departments should investigate and handle online pyramid schemes cases before filing or filing a case. At the same time, it was reported to the provincial industrial and commercial and market supervision departments step by step. Now that the report has been revoked, the conditions for this court to continue to implement preservation measures on the suspected online pyramid schemes assets in this case are no longer met.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An insider involved in this case interpreted this paragraph of text to Southern Weekend reporter. He said, &quot;The word &quot;revoke&quot; is used here instead of withdrawn, which means that the filing may have been revoked by the superior department rather than withdrawn. Yuhua District Municipal Supervision Bureau proactively withdrew the report. After withdrawing the filing, we cannot rule out the possibility that the case will be withdrawn in the future.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the opinion of this person familiar with the matter, in accordance with the principle of &quot;nothing is dismissed&quot; in the &quot;Administrative Penalty Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot;, if the Yuhua District Municipal Supervision Bureau believes that Baokang County has taken effect in the administrative decision If the illegal gains are incorrect, it involves the correction of administrative actions and must be submitted to the competent authority for cancellation in accordance with legal procedures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that the administrative penalty letter of Baokang County gives the secret and true business data of TST Court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The penalty letter shows: From January 1, 2018 to July 2021, TST secretly developed a total of about 7 million members, including about 6.41 million blue card members and about 650,000 red card members. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main business income of the illegal red card is approximately 9.17 billion yuan, the main business cost is approximately 5.64 billion yuan, the main business taxes and surcharges are approximately 37.44 million yuan, and the actual related expenses incurred are approximately 3.458 billion yuan. billion, income tax expenses were 10.46 million yuan, and profits were approximately 19.27 million yuan. The profits of Shanghai Dalwei Trading Co., Ltd. should be considered illegal gains. The final penalty was the confiscation of illegal gains of 19.27 million yuan and a fine of 1.7 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last time Shanghai Dalwei Trading Co., Ltd. was on the top 100 companies in Qingpu District, Shanghai was in 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2021, due to the leakage of relevant replies from the Shijiazhuang Yuhua District Market Supervision Bureau, both Zhang Ting and Lin Ruiyang were banned from Weibo because of their involvement in pyramid schemes. As of May 26, 2022, Zhang Ting and Lin Ruiyang were banned from Weibo. The court&#39;s Weibo was updated again, stating that &quot;Dalway Company encountered legal disputes and sought legal protection, which fully proves that Dalwe Company respects and believes in the legal environment of the motherland.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 29 Oct 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[奥纳·泰德斯：从朋克主唱到新晋画家]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258996]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-29 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/M5PEK9Zqmrdwlpq3WJEolkTcZ4PVGsv33dwOWYW8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;635&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/M5PEK9Zqmrdwlpq3WJEolkTcZ4PVGsv 33dwOWYW8. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254479&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (artist and Taylor Gallery Gia Coppola/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before becoming a painter, Honor Titus was the lead singer of a punk band; before becoming the lead singer of a punk band, he was a writer Also a poet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This path may be reversed and said again: because Ona Titus is a writer and poet, and his friend asked him: Hey, you write poetry anyway, why don’t you just write lyrics for us? ? As a result, he became a member of the punk band Cerebral Ballzy. Then, as the band became an instant hit, well-known artist Raymond Pettibon became a fan and designed the cover of one of their albums. Raymond asked Ona: Hey, I like your song, why don&#39;t you come to my studio and help? So Ona became Raymond&#39;s assistant. After familiarizing himself with all the operations of the art studio, he picked up the paintbrush himself and once again became an instant hit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/wRIs9h63HVnEDSnKteQlhyBXor9w2yLe8a6Xcn2O.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/wRIs9h63HVnEDSnKteQlhyBXor9w2yLe8a6Xcn2O.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254467&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Ona Titus: Viewing Distance&quot; exhibition view, 2023, Longlati Jingwei Art Center, Shanghai&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Longlati Jingwei Art Center/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Asia is Exciting&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;No matter which order you listen to this story, Ona is undoubtedly an enviable lucky person. Almost as soon as he painted his first decent work, he was spotted by Taylor Gallery and brought to New York to exhibit. His paintings were hung side by side with the works of the famous Alex Katz. together. The response from the market is also exciting. Although he is just starting out and does not have any transaction records to back him up, more than 20 important collectors have expressed their intention to buy this painting. He also saw similarities in his paintings and Katz&#39;s paintings: bright colors, simple outlines, flat brushstrokes. &quot;Seeing them hang me and Katz together, I realized that people are Understand my creation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is indeed an eye-catching work: a man and a woman are resting in a leisurely manner on the grass covered with petals. The woman has her back to the picture and cannot see clearly. On the face, the man is like a southern yuppie, wearing a suit and a Panama hat, lying on his back. The whole picture is filled with a kind of nostalgic leisure, which is reminiscent of Seurat&#39;s &quot;Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte&quot; and Manet&#39;s &quot; Lunch on the Grass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/gaYOgkQcj7NCl425bcguB0rX24d8cbS2cSBmJoPX.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;768&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/gaYOgkQcj7NCl425bcguB0rX24d8cbS2cSBmJoPX.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254476&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Kimbella&quot;, 2021, oil on canvas, 121.9cmx152.4cm Private collection, image courtesy of the artist and Taylor Gallery&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I try to write as I go This person, while listening to his song, was frightened by the deafening noise and turned off his headphones three minutes later. I realized that the Ona who painted the painting and the Ona who was the lead singer of the band may be different aspects of the same person. The calmness, alienation, and even classicalness revealed in his paintings are nowhere to be found in his punk music. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ona&#39;s recent solo exhibition &quot;Viewing Distance&quot; at Longlati Jingwei Art Center in Shanghai is his first solo exhibition in China. Prior to this, he had just finished an exhibition at Gagosian, and Asia made him particularly excited. “I had a painting at auction two years ago, and it was finally sold for five times the estimate. The collector is from Asia. It makes me feel the acceptance of my works in the East, and I am also curious about how Chinese audiences will evaluate my paintings.&quot; His pictures can&#39;t help but be associated with the atmosphere of Impressionism, which may be due to the two-dimensional attribute - —In this matter, it was Japanese Ukiyo-e that profoundly influenced Impressionism, and Chinese ink painting that profoundly influenced Ukiyo-e—a hidden line of culture that makes it possible to see déjà vu in viewing, and also reminds this kind of viewing distance on. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Two noble men&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It was Raymond Pattybone who introduced him to the door of painting. For Ona, the few people who worked in Raymond’s studio were The year was a time of &quot;information explosion&quot; in his life. Raymond is a comprehensive artist. He was born in the United States in 1957. He is compatible with many iconic American cultural elements and is especially good at integrating images and text. Literature, art history, philosophy, religion, politics, business, fashion, sports, and deviant youth subculture are all sources of inspiration for Raymond. This complexity greatly influenced Ona. Raymond never taught him how to draw, but often discussed literature with him. &quot;Raymond had a library, almost a small library. He often pulled out classic novels and talked to me about the stories in them.&quot; William. · Blake, Proust, John Ruskin and Walt Whitman... Literary nature constitutes Raymond&#39;s visual rhetoric and also profoundly influenced Ona. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/8uYgnmSlVfIHSOEOD2IM55hztNR7Kjo48EFaSRTk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;687&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/8uYgnmSlVfIHSOEOD2IM55hztNR7Kjo48EFaSRTk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254469&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;AP&#39;s Joy&quot;, 2022, oil on canvas, 182.9cmx121.9cm Danjuma Collection, image courtesy of the artist and Taylor Gallery&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also in Redmond The studio provided Ona with access to a large number of painting classics. He found that he was interested in the Nabi School of painting, including Pierre Bonnard. The style that emphasized outline and color and eliminated perspective naturally lowered the technical threshold and gave amateur painters a simple and straightforward stepping stone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another of Ona&#39;s great friends in painting was Henry Tylor, a famous artist who also lived in Los Angeles. Taylor is an expert at depicting characters, lively and productive. &quot;Some media previously described Henry Taylor as my mentor, but he was actually just a close friend of mine.&quot; Henry Taylor held an exhibition for Ona in his studio, which was Ona&#39;s first as an artist. appearance. At that time, the COVID-19 epidemic broke out in the United States. Hundreds of guests crowded into Henry&#39;s studio. The gallerist among the guests immediately decided to take Ona&#39;s works to New York. &quot;It was really a sensation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/3spC5kJ7sm0AnHOTstxjpylLqCYuCEoK895VcZGC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;852&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data -src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/3spC5kJ7sm0AnHOTstxjpylLqCYuCEoK895VcZGC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254471&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Into the Blue&quot;, 2021, oil on canvas, 214cmx183.5cm Collection of David and Indre Roberts. Image Courtesy of the artist and Taylor Gallery&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Novel Painting&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Thanks to a writer’s eye, Ona is most interested in people. Every minute he spent on the streets of China, he was observing the crowds around him and learning to speak Chinese at every opportunity. He enjoys painting people, including people in motion, people feasting in fine clothes, and people living leisurely and alone. He fixes a certain moment of people in a specific situation, and that moment itself is narrative. When he wanders around art galleries, his eyes are always drawn to paintings about people, such as Hopper or Andy Warhol. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different from those artists who usually accumulate visual materials and are good at photography or sketching, Ona&#39;s pictures are novel-like. He likes to paint fictitious images in his mind rather than copying real moments in life. His inspiration often comes from music or literature. &quot;I did a painting of Miles Davis riding a horse, purely from my imagination.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com /cms/medias/image/23/10/18/v1ALTKi3JPH8Ma62koQLTw1QG3Ho1RuykZMp03mD.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image /23/10/18/v1ALTKi3JPH8Ma62koQLTw1QG3Ho1RuykZMp03mD.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254474&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Summer at Dodger Hall, 2021 , oil on canvas, 152.4cmx182.9cm Collection of Rony &amp;amp; Orly Grushka, image courtesy of the artist and Taylor Gallery&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Legendary musician Miles Davis is an outstanding conductor and performer in the history of American jazz music family, but later fell into drug addiction and bankruptcy, struggling with difficulties. &quot;Miles grew up in the green countryside of St. Louis. He could ride horses as a child. Later he came to New York and entered the Juilliard School and experienced difficult times.&quot; Miles painted by Ona, Galloping horses in New York&#39;s Central Park was the image in his mind, and painting was to create images that might not exist but that the artist firmly believed existed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Ona, painting was an unexpected success, bringing him wealth and a completely different life experience, but it delayed his ideal of becoming a writer. Music, painting, reading, writing... He jumps between different fields like a grid-jumper, with a playful agility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;What else do you want to draw next?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I will write my novel within five years.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;What kind of novel?&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&quot;By no means an autobiography, I hope it is the kind of novel that Fitzgerald and Salinger would write.

She previously worked in a radio station for nearly thirty years as an announcer, Host and other jobs, now retired. It is difficult to define the concept of retirement for professional and technical personnel. They usually retire without rest: radio stations build training schools and ask her to teach broadcasting and hosting classes; relevant professional competitions ask her to be a judge and host programs; commercial organizations ask her to dub, Advertising... I used to be busy all day long, as fulfilling as working, and earning more than my pension. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But now, I am basically retired, there are fewer and fewer jobs, and the remuneration for labor is getting lower and lower. In the past few years, the remuneration for each service was around 1,000-1,500 yuan, but later it dropped to 500, and then to 200-300 yuan each time. A few days ago, a shopping website asked: Do you want to accept product advertisements worth 20-30 yuan each? She felt exhausted both physically and mentally. This was really pointless. Forget it, let&#39;s not steal the business of young girls and boys. She had a pension after all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I watched the recent AI dubbing and was deeply shocked. I told her: It’s not you taking away the business of young girls and boys, nor is it someone taking away your business. But under the attack of AI, you will basically all be unemployed. Fortunately, I still have a pension. What should those young people who have studied broadcasting for more than ten years do? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The current AI dubbing can achieve (on the algorithm side) intelligent translation and avoid nonsensical low-level errors; (on the audio side) simulate the timbre and voice of the object, and give it the personality characteristics of spoken language; (on the audio side) Video side) Correct the mouth shape. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The result is: Swift and Trump actually spoke in very standard Chinese, while Cai Ming’s skit was performed in English. And the timbre is very similar to their own, and even the Mandarin spoken by Trump can be set to Mandarin with a slight southern accent. Not only can the sound be real, but in terms of video, their mouth shapes are highly consistent with the language they speak. Only by observing very carefully can you find traces of video modification in very few links. Based on the current speed of AI development, perhaps in a year, this weak trace of modification will be difficult to detect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of intelligent translation, Call Annie, an intelligent interactive chat system based on ChatGPT launched by Animato, has been applied to Apple 12 and above platforms. As soon as it was launched, the stock price of Chegg, an American education platform, plummeted by 50%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Call Annie is not only a chat software, but also a fully AI education system. Currently, it can provide language services in English, French, German, Spanish and other major languages, and its teaching content covers professional knowledge in various disciplines such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, programming, and finance. It can be expected that in the next 1-2 years, Call Annie is likely to develop to cover various human languages, including most minor languages ​​​​and even dialects, and the teaching content it can provide will increase exponentially. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What’s even more amazing is: Call Annie does not require class appointments, is currently free, and can chat 24 hours a day. It does not feel tired, irritable, angry, or needs to get off work like human teachers do. It is more patient and has a good attitude. , He also didn’t criticize or reprimand. Even though I had a poor foundation and was mentally retarded, he still took the trouble to teach. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under such a powerful AI attack, it is estimated that many language teachers, basic knowledge teaching teachers, translators, and even university teaching assistants... as long as they are non-original research professors, will be in danger of being eliminated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such a powerful AI is still evolving day and night. When I fall asleep, it is still learning, iterating, and improving... I don’t know whether I should continue to call it &quot;it&quot; or prepare to change it to &quot;He, she&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The attack of AI and the challenge to existing human work are not imminent, but the &quot;wolf&quot; has already arrived. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;IBM recently stated that it will suspend recruitment for positions that may be replaced by AI in the next few years, approximately 26,000 jobs. In the next five years, 30% of these positions will be replaced by AI and automation, which will involve the work of nearly 8,000 people. This is just IBM! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;February 2023, &quot;Fortune&quot; survey: 48% of 1,000 companies in the United States are gradually using ChatGPT to replace human employees, which will involve the work and livelihood of tens of thousands of white-collar workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Goldman Sachs analyst Ben Snyder said: &quot;In the next 10 years, artificial intelligence may increase productivity by 1.5% per year. This may increase the profits of S&amp;P 500 companies by 30% in the next 10 years.&quot; % or more.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only the United States, but also all walks of life in the country have also been impacted by AI. In April 2023, a large number of original animators at game companies were laid off, and some companies even laid off more than half of their original animators. The labor remuneration for a single painting by a freelancer has dropped from 1,500 yuan to about 200 yuan. We predicted in a previous article that arts and crafts designers would gradually lose their jobs, just over a year ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Blue Focus, a well-known domestic advertising company, has completely stopped outsourcing copywriting and switched to AI writing. There is an e-commerce company founder who spent 3 months training GPT to write product copywriting and replaced 7 employees. Some Taobao merchants have used AI-generated digital models instead of real ones. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, my sister’s loss of her former professional voice work was not an isolated case, but just a note in the common fate of millions of professional and technical people in the context of this era. The advancement of AI has developed from the field of engineering technology to the visual arts industry, and then expanded to language and performing arts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even Lu Qi, the former president of Baidu, said: Now there is a time for swearing every week, because I am so shocked by the technology that I can’t help but swear. Because after the emergence of ChatGPT, AI technology has been developing rapidly in days. Under the impact of the AI ​​wave, no matter whether it is science and engineering, liberal arts, or art, whether it is grassroots production personnel, professional and technical personnel, administrative personnel, or even senior executives, all People can stay out of things. Where will the development of science and technology push mankind in the future? This may have exceeded our current cognitive abilities and thinking framework. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 29 Oct 2023 10:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[生态环境部答南周：对碳排放数据弄虚作假“零容忍”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259511]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-29 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/10/28/f7ffc589d7.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/ 28/f7ffc589d7.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255859&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Liu Youbin, spokesperson of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment. Ministry of Ecology and Environment | Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 27, 2023, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment held a regular press conference. Liu Youbin, spokesperson of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, said that the theme of this conference is to actively respond to climate change, promote green, low-carbon and high-quality development, and release the &quot;2023 Annual Report on China&#39;s Policies and Actions to Address Climate Change&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since the launch of the national carbon market in July 2021, the quality of carbon emission data has attracted much attention. Xia Yingxian, director of the Department of Climate Change, made his debut after taking up his new post. When answering questions from Southern Weekend reporters, he said that overall, companies&#39; awareness of emission reduction has significantly improved, their regulatory capabilities have been significantly improved, and the quality of carbon emission data has been significantly improved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Among the measures taken by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, the &quot;national-provincial-municipal&quot; three-level joint review mechanism for carbon emission data quality plays an important role. After enterprises submit data and certification materials through the management platform every month, national departments are responsible for big data screening and regular spot checks, provincial government departments are responsible for technical review, and prefecture-level government departments are responsible for on-site spot checks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Xia Yingxian introduced that the &quot;national-provincial-municipal&quot; three-level joint review mechanism follows the management idea of ​​&quot;using the day to protect the month, using the month to protect the year&quot; to ensure that every day , monthly, and annual data are stable and reliable, &quot;reflecting our cautious and cautious attitude towards data quality.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/09b6f3748b.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/09b6f3748b.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255860&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Xia Yingxian, Director of the Department of Climate Change Response of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment. Ministry of Ecology and Environment | Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Do a good job in daily supervision of data quality&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Xia Yingxian said that the Ministry of Ecology and Environment has always attached great importance to carbon emission data quality management. There is &quot;zero tolerance&quot; for illegal and illegal activities such as data falsification. Especially since 2022, a series of measures have been taken to ensure that carbon emission data is accurate and reliable, focusing on comprehensively improving data quality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For example, in terms of the construction of the legal system, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment has actively cooperated with the Supreme People&#39;s Court and the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate to revise and issue judicial interpretations to criminalize the falsification of carbon emission data. Sanction scope. The accounting and verification guidelines were revised and introduced, reducing the formulas involved in carbon emission report verification from 27 to 12, optimizing the accounting methods, and effectively improving the pertinence, scientificity and operability of the work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In terms of supervision and law enforcement, since 2021, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment has organized supervision and assistance, guided by problem clues, guided enterprises to standardize emission accounting reporting behaviors, and severely cracked down on Engage in deceptive behavior. Xia Yingxian said that the Ministry of Ecology and Environment will severely punish and reduce carbon emission quotas for emission-controlled companies that have verified data to be falsified in accordance with the law; it has exposed a number of third-party verification agencies that violate laws and regulations, which has a great deterrent effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In terms of carbon emission management capabilities, Xia Yingxian introduced that the national carbon emissions trading management platform will be launched online in 2023, realizing inventory management, emission management, and data quality supervision. , verification management, and quota management are intelligent and digital, and big data means are used to enrich data quality management technical means. Since 2023, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment has held 5 special training courses on carbon emission data quality management and supervision and law enforcement, with more than 5,000 trainees, and supervision capabilities have been significantly improved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Xia Yingxian also said that in the next step, we will continue to do a good job in daily supervision of data quality and make full use of the &quot;national-provincial-municipal&quot; three-level joint review working mechanism. Conduct spot checks and reports on data quality management work in various regions, establish and improve daily supervision and technical review systems for greenhouse gas emission data, clarify technical review standards and procedures, and consolidate the main responsibilities of key emission units. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Carbon price is in line with China’s current reality&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the press conference , Xia Yingxian also mentioned the progress of the national carbon market construction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A total of 2,257 key emission units in the power generation industry have been included in the second compliance cycle (2021 and 2022) of the national carbon market, covering annual carbon dioxide emissions of more than 5 billion tons. . The quotas for 2021 and 2022 have been distributed in August 2023, and payment and compliance are currently underway. Xia Yingxian revealed that the current contract fulfillment rate has exceeded 60%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Xia Yingxian believes that the national carbon market has achieved the expected construction goals. &quot;After more than two years of construction and operation, the overall operation of the national carbon market is stable, the price discovery mechanism has initially appeared, and corporate emission reduction awareness and capabilities have been significantly enhanced, playing a positive role in promoting the goal of achieving carbon peak and carbon neutrality.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Xia Yingxian said that the national carbon market has initially established an institutional framework system, breaking through the blocking points in key links such as reporting verification, quota allocation, market transactions, settlement and compliance, etc. Difficulties, and realize full-service intelligence through the national carbon market management platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Regarding the topic of carbon market expansion, Xia Yingxian stated that it is urgent to include more qualified industries into the national carbon emissions trading market to reduce the cost of emission reduction for the whole society. We will insist on making progress while maintaining stability, and prioritize the inclusion of industries that contribute significantly to achieving the goal of carbon peak and carbon neutrality, have serious overcapacity, have great synergy potential for pollution reduction and carbon reduction, and have good data quality foundations. Each mature industry will be included in the industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The expansion of the carbon market requires a good data foundation. Xia Yingxian introduced that the Ministry of Ecology and Environment conducts annual carbon emission accounting report verification work nationwide every year for petrochemical, chemical, building materials, steel, non-ferrous metals, papermaking, civil aviation and other industries, and collects data from more than 6,000 companies. The above-mentioned 7 industries The total direct emissions from the power generation and power generation industries account for more than 70% of the country&#39;s total. In addition, special studies were organized on quota allocation methods, accounting and reporting methods, verification points, and expansion implementation paths for seven industries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As of October 25, 2023, the cumulative transaction volume of carbon emission quotas is 365 million tons, and the cumulative transaction volume is 19.437 billion yuan. The carbon price after the launch of the national carbon market Maintained at around 50-80 yuan/ton. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Recently, the quota price has shown an overall upward trend, maintaining at around 80 yuan/ton. The moderate increase in carbon price reflects the market nature of carbon price.&quot; Xia Yingxian believes that the carbon price is in line with China&#39;s current reality and basically reflects my country’s emission reduction costs. In the next step, we will study the establishment of a market adjustment mechanism and take measures such as early warning of contract performance risks to adjust market supply and demand, enhance market vitality, and ensure the healthy, stable and orderly operation of the market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 29 Oct 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[从“三吠举报”到“恶犬法案”：美国人怎么养狗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259368]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;It is well known that many people in the United States love dogs. However, these Americans love and raise dogs to achieve a certain balance under the support of their specific natural conditions, social conditions and legal environment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, in my opinion, the most important and overlooked point is that the United States is not a rabies epidemic area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A total of 202 human rabies cases were reported in 143 districts and counties in China in 2020. Dogs in the United States hardly carry the rabies virus, and the few rabies cases are caused by wild animals (mainly bats). A total of five people died of rabies in the United States in 2021, the highest number of rabies deaths in the country in 10 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Differences in natural conditions will cause huge differences in social adaptation. When there are no worries about rabies, the intimacy between humans and cats and dogs will greatly increase, and dogs will not be too taboo about what they eat or lick. Even strange stray dogs don’t have to worry about rabies. This creates a close human-dog relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is the living area and living pattern of Americans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, the per capita housing area in the United States is 67 square meters, ranking first in the world. In addition to the large average area, there are also structural differences in urbanization rates. The overall average urbanization rate in the United States currently reaches 83%, and the urbanization rate in some metropolitan areas is close to 100%. China&#39;s urbanization rate in 2022 will be 65.22%. The problem of dog ownership is largely an urban problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Calculated in terms of per capita housing area in domestic cities, especially large and medium-sized cities, it is about half that of the United States. This is just the living area, not the living mode. Chinese people mostly live in high-rise buildings and share the green environment of the community, while Americans mostly live in suburban villas. Americans have far more outdoor space per household. Therefore, Chinese people use half of their living area and much less public outdoor area to raise dogs, which naturally creates more conflicts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The United States also has another characteristic, that is, it is more diverse, has a large place, has many choices, and does not interfere with each other. It not only protects the rights of dog lovers, but also protects the rights of people who do not love dogs. There are many communities in the United States that prohibit pets. Not only are dogs not allowed in these communities, but dogs from outside are not even allowed to &quot;visit&quot;. Have a peaceful time together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Americans love dogs, and although the living area is large, the density is low, and there are many green spaces, it does not mean that American dogs do not bite people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, approximately 1,000 people in the United States require emergency care treatment for serious dog bites every day, and more than 4.5 million people are bitten by dogs each year, with 30 to 50 People are killed by dogs. Injuries caused by dog ​​bites and attacks result in the need for 30,000 surgeries in the United States each year, including sutures and staples. In 2020, U.S. insurance companies paid $854 million for dog bites and attacks, with the average dog bite insurance claim amount being $50,245. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Humane Society of the United States estimates that 51% of dog bite victims are children, which means more than 2 million children are bitten by dogs in the United States each year. Among dog bite deaths, the highest proportion is among those aged 0-4 years. Since children under 1 year old are often unable to walk and are often looked after by adults, the rate of bites is the lowest. After the age of 4, as children get older, the likelihood of being bitten decreases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, although Americans love dogs, they also strictly manage dog ownership. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For general harassment, take New York City as an example. If you are reported for not picking up dog poop while walking your dog, the police will issue a $250 (1,800 RMB) fine and may also require you to appear in court. The law also prohibits the harassment of pet dogs in all public and private places. If the dog is not kept on a leash, a fine of 200-400 US dollars will be imposed. For dog nuisances, follow the &quot;three barking report&quot; principle: if a dog from any household barks more than three times in a residential area, it will be considered a nuisance, and neighbors can report it. Under strict regulations, most dog walkers in the United States are self-conscious, and leash-free dog walking is rare. If a dog poops, most dog owners use plastic bags to collect the poop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the law stipulates that people who keep high-risk ferocious dogs must erect signs in conspicuous places in their yards to remind passersby to pay attention. In public places, high-risk ferocious dogs must wear a restraint leash and an anti-bite muzzle at all times. Otherwise, law enforcement agencies have the right to impound or execute the dog. Depending on the severity of the case, the dog owner may be held criminally responsible and may even be sentenced to 90 days in jail. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For higher levels of physical risk, some states have enacted so-called &quot;vicious dog laws.&quot; A dog is considered a &quot;vicious dog&quot; if it attacks or injures a human or their pet within a two-year period, or exhibits aggressive behavior that requires the police or animal control agencies to stop or drive away. Such dogs must be isolated, prohibited from contact with humans, and undergo mandatory training. If the owner refuses to cooperate, the dog may be euthanized. The Vicious Dog Act requires dog owners to take full responsibility for their dogs. If a dog attacks a person and the owner fails to take strict precautions and deal with it promptly, resulting in casualties, the dog owner must be responsible for all injuries and may even be subject to criminal penalties. If a dog attacks a human after escaping, the owner is still responsible for the dog&#39;s behavior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are very sound pet shelters and rescue stations across the United States, funded by the government and private organizations, to take in and rescue stray cats and dogs. In shelters, sheltered dogs and other animals are treated well. Americans love dogs, and there are always enough volunteers at shelters. Stray dogs in shelters generally have a 1-2 week deadline for adoption. Non-governmental animal protection organizations also try their best to allow dogs in shelters to be adopted. After that, if no one comes to adopt them, they will be euthanized. Statistics show that of the 8.5 million stray dogs sheltered in the United States in 2010, 82% were adopted and taken away by new owners, while the remaining 1.53 million old, sick, and unadopted dogs were euthanized. Although many civil organizations are trying to change euthanasia and replace it with sterilization, raising funds is still an unavoidable obstacle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All public issues are like this. Rights and obligations cannot be neglected or mentioned only on one side. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[年度佳作，没有人经得起剖析审视]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259240]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 22:01:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;&lt;span>;There are many movies about marriage.

Luozha County is located in a mountain valley, and the county seat winds along the only mountain road in the middle. I chose to come to Luozha, Shannan City, to visit the Sakagutuo Temple with a history of more than 900 years in the Border Se Township. This is a pilgrimage road often walked by Buddhists. It has a long history and a mysterious place. As for the scenery, although I am not a Buddhist, I am also full of yearning for the beautiful scenery on the border. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At 9 o&#39;clock in the morning, I set off from the bus station in the northern suburbs of Lhasa and passed through the beautiful Yanghu Lake and rows of snow-capped mountains. When I arrived in Lozha County, it was about 4 o&#39;clock in the afternoon. I immediately bought the only daily ticket at the station. A ticket to Sexiang. It still takes nearly two hours to drive to Sexiang. The road begins to narrow and there are more gravels. But I was still attracted by the barren and spectacular scenery outside the window. One side of the car is close to the exposed rocks, and the other side is close to the rushing river. The river is rushing forward happily, as if it is racing with the car. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/4CJwybPlikMf1N8rb8DErCaYsiUpV1g4HfqvdEr5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/4CJwybPlikMf1N8rb8DErCaYsiUpV1g4HfqvdEr5.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255466&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Loza County&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Wei/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There were only five or six people on the bus An old Tibetan man, a young Tibetan man and me.

He wore a down jacket and carried a small plastic bag with him, but no other luggage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was already 7:30 when I arrived in Sexiang. I quickly found a place to stay before it got dark. The entire township is located on a flat land in the mountains. There are dozens of buildings built along the road. They are all occupied by local people. In order to welcome guests, some have been converted into hotels and some into restaurants. Hotels are either closed or full, and the owner is rarely there, leaving only a phone number. Finally, I finally found a bed at the Sakaguto Temple Hotel. There was a public bathroom, but I couldn&#39;t take a shower. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/Zr1UWUXJhF4ejzye7gI0fYIs2ePDIci33DQAPxht.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;702&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/Zr1UWUXJhF4ejzye7gI0fYIs2ePDIci33DQAPxht.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255467&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Saika Gutuo Temple in Sexiang&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Wei/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;sai Kagutuo Monastery was originally a monastery of the Kagyu sect of Tibetan Buddhism, but later converted to the Gelug sect. It is a must-visit place for Tibetan pilgrims. The main building of Sakagutuo Temple, which has a history of more than 900 years, has been relatively completely preserved. The temple is located in the middle of Se Township, next to the cliff, and the sound of rushing river water comes from the bottom of the mountain, which is quiet and distant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a legendary and touching story of redemption behind the nine-story tower of Sakagutuo Temple. According to legend, in the 11th century, Marpa, the founder of the Kagyu sect, who was known as &quot;one of the seven great translators of ancient Tibet&quot;, had a disciple named Milarepa. He lost his father when he was young, his wealth was seized by relatives, and his family was enslaved. When he grew up, he learned magic and killed 35 people in revenge. Later, in order to atone for his sins, Milarepa came to Sexiang to become a disciple of Marpa. Marpa ordered Milarepa to build Sakagutuo Temple alone (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;Means &quot;Nine-story Gongzi Castle&quot;&lt;/span>;). Day after day, year after year, every time he built it, Marpa asked him to overthrow and rebuild it, until it was finally completed the sixth time. The current Sakagutuo Temple was built at that time (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;later repaired and expanded&lt;/span>;). Ancient prayer wheels hang on the outside of the predominantly yellow temple, and murals from hundreds of years ago can still be faintly seen on the mottled walls inside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/pxdG2sSTqGXq9MC2LtS1A4lLkzoChetIoN1Fsd6t.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/pxdG2sSTqGXq9MC2LtS1A4lLkzoChetIoN1Fsd6t.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255472&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Green space by the Sexiang River and a released calf&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Wei/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;There is a small suspended plank road on the top of the 9-story watchtower tower for people to pray for blessings. When I climbed to the ninth floor, a lama said that since I had come up, I should go around the tower. It is said that turning once can wash away all the bad luck in the past life; turning twice can pray for the health and happiness of parents; turning three times will prevent you from falling into hell in the next life. However, except for the steel poles that can be grasped by hand, there are no protective fences around the top of the tower. I was afraid of heights and dared not go up. Finally, I walked around in a circle under the leadership of the lama. The young lama chanted sutras while walking. He walked many times every day and it became a daily routine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Sakagutuo Temple is very small and can be completed in less than half an hour. On the top of the mountain south of Sexiang, there is also Lodro Wolong Monastery, which is the birthplace of the Kagyu Sect of Tibetan Buddhism and was built by Master Marpa when he was 29 years old. According to the official website of Luozha County Government, &quot;Luo&quot; means &quot;south&quot;, &quot;Zhuowo&quot; means &quot;beginning of auspiciousness&quot;, and &quot;Long&quot; means &quot;prophecy&quot;.

I found a ride on the road and met a Tibetan family who drove up the mountain and picked me up. The family came from neighboring Cona County and came to Luozha County for pilgrimage for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/inSaPHeNkpXYh4IsTR42m20Z8b2IQG4o1WhqTgvd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/inSaPHeNkpXYh4IsTR42m20Z8b2IQG4o1WhqTgvd.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255471&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color ) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sexiang is dozens of kilometers away from Bhutan. Opposite the Sekhar Guto Temple is the Bhutanese commodity store, and the back of the mountain where Lodro Wolong Temple is located is In Bhutan, our ID cards were held at the checkpoint on the way up the mountain. The dusty gravel road was winding and difficult to walk. A couple from Guangdong decided to give up after driving for a short distance, but this Tibetan family did not. After half an hour, we successfully reached the top of the mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are only temples on the mountain, and the landscape is extremely open. Several huge crows are circling overhead, and the shadows of clouds are cast on the mountain. Lodzo Wolong Temple is built along the stone wall on the top of the mountain. In addition to the main temple, there are also many small hermitages scattered under the cliff. A lama who has been practicing for many years has long hair reaching his waist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The lamas in Lodro Wolong Monastery are the most enthusiastic lamas I have ever encountered. They explained the story behind the temple to everyone who went up the mountain. Even though I was the only Han tourist, after they finished telling a long list of Tibetan words, they would tell it to me again in Chinese. According to them, the old Lodro Wolong Temple was destroyed and was rebuilt in 1992. There is a sky burial platform at the top of the mountain. A lama in his twenties said that it was built based on a stone that Marpa carried back from India where he studied scriptures for 12 years. On the hillside at the foot of the temple, there is a flat area surrounded by prayer flags. The place where stones are piled is Shunyuantian. According to legend, this is the place where Marpa and Milarepa met for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We stayed on the mountain for more than half a day, during which time the temple held a Dharma ceremony and witnessed the Tibetan Buddhist Dharma ceremony. Finally, I went down the mountain with the Tibetan family, and the car went around the zigzag road back to Sexiang. We separated and continued our journeys. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[好心多修120米路要拆除？公共资金不能这么造丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259415]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A long-awaited road has been built an extra 120 meters, becoming an illegal land occupation and will be demolished , wait until the procedures are completed before re-doing it. Why is it so fussy? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to reports from the Hunan Radio and Television Urban Channel, a new road in Changsha City that nearby residents have long awaited will be opened soon. However, a section of this road was suddenly surrounded again recently, and excavators were excavating the paved asphalt road. Street lights, street trees and other facilities on the roadside were also dismantled and removed, and garbage trucks were also brought in from other places. The loess was transported and poured on the road. What happened? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It turns out that the main part of this road is in Changsha Economic Development Zone, but it extends 120 meters to Furong District. When the Economic Development Zone Urban Construction Company was building the road, it built an extra 120 meters along the way without going through the construction application procedures with the relevant departments of Furong District. The Furong District Natural Resources and Planning Department determined that this was “illegal land occupation.” As a result, the Economic Development Zone Urban Construction Company responsible for the construction began to demolish the road. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to media reports, staff from the Economic Development Zone Urban Construction Company said that they agreed that the land was indeed being used illegally, but they were &quot;purely out of good intentions.&quot; Also, if we don&#39;t build more of these 120 meters, there may be no way to connect it with other roads, and there will be a section of &quot;intestinal obstruction&quot; in the middle, so it won&#39;t make much sense to build this road, so we &quot;kindly&quot; help and provide money and efforts to complete it. The more than 100 meters of road should be repaired. So when they were deemed illegal by the relevant departments of Furong District, they felt a little aggrieved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Furong District, the extra 120 meters of road construction is within my jurisdiction. According to regulations, road construction should follow procedures and be submitted for approval in advance. It is of course illegal to build roads without approval. The competent department requires that the illegal status be eliminated and the construction be restored to its original state. The construction application procedures will be completed before re-repairing, which is completely &quot;in accordance with the law and regulations and in compliance with the procedures.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There seems to be nothing wrong with both sides. However, after construction and demolition, demolition and construction again, a lot of money was wasted. What went wrong? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Jingkai District Urban Construction Company that built the road built it without approval. Of course, there were violations of laws and regulations. However, the road has been repaired, and it is indeed a road that has been long-awaited by the nearby people and is necessary to be repaired. However, if it is forced to be demolished, the problem may be even greater. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all this is a huge waste of public funds. Although the 120-meter road is not long, it costs a lot. The entire road is about 1 kilometer long and costs 60 million yuan. Calculating the cost of 120 meters is 6 to 7 million yuan, and dismantling it will also cost a lot of money. Once it was built or demolished, millions would disappear. This is a municipal road, and the Economic Development Zone Urban Construction Company responsible for its construction is also a state-owned enterprise. The source of its construction funds must be public funds of the local government, that is, public money. For Furong District, it is a good thing that the Economic Development Zone is willing to spend the money to build its own roads. If it is forced to be demolished and then rebuilt by oneself, although the cost of demolition will be borne by the Economic Development District Urban Construction Company, the cost of reconstruction will still be borne by Furong District. It is also incomprehensible to abandon existing roads that have been built with help from others and to dig up and spend money to rebuild them yourself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, a section of the repaired road is dug out, and the rest becomes a dead end road. It took three years to build this road, and the nearby people had been waiting for it for three years. It was finally opened, but a section was demolished, and its effectiveness was greatly reduced. If we have to go through the formalities and rebuild it again, I am afraid we will have to wait at least another year and a half. This will bring great inconvenience to the public&#39;s travel and will also damage the image of the local government in the public mind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Requiring the Economic Development Zone to demolish the roads and then rebuild them themselves can be said to be harmful to Furong District and not beneficial to itself. So why do the relevant departments in Furong District do this? From the perspective of organizational behavior, perhaps one or two explanations can be given. For some departments, they must make the decision on their own territory. It is absolutely unacceptable for others to interfere with their boundaries without telling them. Even if you spend more money, you must maintain your authority. After all, if you want to spend money, it is also a financial expense, rather than having to pay out of your own pocket. Only consider issues from the perspective of one place and one department, from the perspective of maintaining the authority of the local area and this department, only consider legal compliance from the perspective of this department, and show your sense of existence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for whether the decision made is reasonable from a higher level, whether it will waste financial resources and state-owned assets, waste local taxpayers&#39; money and public interests and perceptions, and consume administrative credibility, it is not considered. scope. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This incident shows the fragmentation and lack of coordination among relevant government departments, the lack of appreciation for the use of fiscal funds, and the lack of care for the waste of state-owned assets. Such things are not uncommon. In the past few years, roads in some cities have been dug up frequently. Today they are laying water pipes, tomorrow they are burying wires, and the day after tomorrow they have to repair sewers. Frequently digging and repairing, repairing and digging again not only wastes construction funds, but also doubles the construction period and brings great inconvenience to citizens&#39; travel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, after the media reports this time, the relevant departments of Changsha Furong District have urgently stopped the behavior of damaging the road surface, and have speeded up the relevant procedures to legalize the 120-meter road as soon as possible. This case has been solved. I hope there will be fewer such absurd things in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“软实力之父”约瑟夫·奈：“中美间的交流应该是面向所有人的”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259507]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Is there destined to be a war between China and the United States? My answer Yes, no.&quot; Joseph Nye, a professor at Harvard Kennedy School, gave a negative answer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Joseph Nye is a representative figure of the neoliberal school of international relations. Before and after the Cold War, Joseph Nye was famous for proposing the concept of &quot;soft power&quot;. Soft power refers to a country&#39;s strength other than economic and military strength, and mainly refers to influence such as culture, values, and public opinion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He served successively as Assistant Secretary of State in the Carter administration, Chairman of the National Intelligence Council and Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Clinton administration. He is also a leading figure in American politics. But he reminded that the history of mankind is full of situations where wars &quot;accidentally&quot; entered. As long as China and the United States strengthen cooperation and act cautiously, wars can be avoided. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;China-US relations are one of the most important bilateral relations in the world today. On October 27, 2023, U.S. President Biden met at the White House with visiting member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since October 23, Joseph Nye has embarked on his first visit to China after the COVID-19 epidemic. Judging from the public schedule in just one week, the &quot;Father of Soft Power&quot; has successively attended speeches at many think tanks and universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the afternoon of October 25, in the Qiulin Lecture Hall of the School of International Relations at Peking University, Joseph Nye spoke with the topic &quot;Are China and the United States destined to have a war?&quot; Hundreds of teachers and students discussed &quot;The History and Future of Sino-US Relations.&quot; The conference was jointly hosted by the School of International Relations at Peking University and the Institute of International Strategic Studies at Peking University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Joseph Nye once proposed the &quot;20-year cycle theory of Sino-US relations&quot;, that is, since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, the ups and downs of the relationship between the two countries have been based on a 20-year cycle. And change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In the long run, China and the United States will have better relations. But in the short term, China and the United States still have differences to resolve.&quot; Joseph Nye told the South Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Joseph Nye believes that after 2017, Sino-US relations entered a cycle of great power competition. &quot;China-U.S. relations have gotten worse in the past. In a sense, I think we have seen the deterioration of Sino-U.S. relations, but I hope things will get better.&quot; Joseph Nye told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In recent years, discussions about the &quot;new cold war&quot; between China and the United States have been rampant in European and American public opinion circles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Joseph Nye&#39;s view, the Cold War between China and the United States is completely incommensurable with the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. “During the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, although there was military and political competition between the two countries, their economic and social ties were very sparse. But now China and the United States are highly interdependent in many fields such as economy, society, and ecology. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2020, Joseph Nye wrote an article in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; that the Cold War between China and the United States is completely avoidable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Joseph Nye supports China and the United States in strengthening cooperation in public health, climate change and other fields. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Exchanges between China and the United States should be open to everyone. Exchanges at the cultural and scientific levels are equally important.&quot; Joseph Nye told Southern Weekend reporters that he hopes The public&#39;s attention should not only focus on high-level people, but also exert soft power. Low-level contacts are also very important. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;The following is an interview with Joseph Nye:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Sino-US relations have gotten worse in the past. In a sense, we have seen a deterioration in Sino-US relations, but I hope things will get better. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Unfortunately, during the COVID-19 epidemic, communication between China and the United States has not been sufficient. However, communication between China and the United States has begun to change. The United States sent important cabinet members to visit China, and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi also arrived in Washington for a visit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I think Sino-US relations are making progress. Two years ago, Sino-US relations were worse than they are now. What we&#39;re seeing today is some pickup, and I hope it continues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Among China and the United States, China not only has strong economic performance, but also has the attraction of traditional culture. I believe that a country’s soft power comes not only from government actions but also from civil society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The U.S. government often does some unpopular things, but despite this, America&#39;s civil society remains attractive to others because it is relatively free. Therefore, the soft power of the United States comes more from universities, non-profit organizations, and foundations, such as the Bill Gates Foundation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is undeniable that people&#39;s views of the United States have gone up and down in recent years. In my opinion, the soft power of the United States has gone up and down. During the Vietnam War and when U.S. troops invaded Iraq, U.S. soft power was declining. The soft power of the United States returned again with the election of Obama as President of the United States in 2008, and fell together with Trump (who became President of the United States) in 2016. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Soft power does not decline linearly or rise linearly. It is often cyclical. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Now, the soft power of the United States is weakening due to internal divisions within the United States. On the other hand, if you look at the hard power of the United States, you will see that the U.S. economy is booming. The United States is a wellspring of innovation, leading in technological fields such as biotechnology and artificial intelligence. Looking at the situation in the Middle East today, (U.S.) military power is still very important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Biden administration has been in power for three years and has a more balanced view (compared to the Trump administration). They still believe there are still benefits to working with China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In May this year, the G7 summit changed its focus on decoupling from China to de-risking on China. This expression means Countries outside the G7 will adopt partial decoupling from China, mostly in the security field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In other words, de-risking does not mean completely cutting off economic ties, but there are limits. U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan called it &quot;building a high wall around a small yard.&quot; We should not let this small yard grow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;To prevent deterioration, Sino-US relations should start with high-level contacts. Next, look for areas of cooperation between China and the United States, which can convey to the public of both countries that cooperation with another country is beneficial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I think this is an area where China and the United States can strengthen cooperation (position on the Russia-Ukraine conflict). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;China and the United States can also strengthen cooperation in other areas, such as climate change and working with the WHO to respond to epidemics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Exchanges between China and the United States should be open to everyone. Obviously, people always focus on the president or the cabinet. Exchange on cultural and scientific levels is equally important. If we need to build trust and cooperation (with each other) and exert soft power, low-level engagement is very important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;(Sino-US relations) have become increasingly complex and difficult to resolve in the short term. I tend to use &quot;short-term pessimists&quot; and &quot;long-term optimists&quot; to describe China and the United States as not posing a threat to each other. In the long run, China and the United States will have better relations. But in the short term, China and the United States still have differences to resolve. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 19:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一斤力气9分钱，重庆最后的女棒棒]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259500]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;July 2021, Chongqing Mountain City Trail, sculptures representing Chongqing sticks and traditional stilted buildings .

You&#39;re still alive.&quot; This is the advice that 51-year-old Huang Xiuli often encounters when carrying goods at Chongqing&#39;s Chaotianmen Comprehensive Wholesale Market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Standing on the heights of Chaotianmen, you can see the intersection of the Jialing River and the Yangtze River. This is the largest water pier in Chongqing. South of the Jialing River and on the north bank of the Yangtze River is the Yangtze River Binjiang Road. On this modern street, there is the Chaotianmen Comprehensive Trading Market, the largest wholesale market gathering place in Chongqing. It is like a streamer, flowing with people buying goods from all over the country. Chongqing’s economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The mountainous city of Chongqing has steep roads and few flat areas, and its unique topography provides Bangbang with a living space. &quot;Bangbang&quot; is a Chongqing dialect that originally means &quot;stick&quot;. It is a local name for farmers who carry a bamboo stick and engage in heavy manual labor. In the Chaotianmen Comprehensive Trading Market, Bangbangs are responsible for the last link in this economic chain: transportation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;If you look carefully, you can find a few female figures among the sticks passing through the shops in the market. With their hair cut short or in buns, they look sophisticated and sophisticated, just like the men who dominate the industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some of them work alone, and some open &quot;couple teams&quot;. In industries where they sell their physical strength to make a living, they often have to deal with employers questioning their &quot;business capabilities.&quot; But even so, they don&#39;t want to give up the stick. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Moving things uphill is the most annoying thing”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At Chaotianmen at 6 o&#39;clock in the morning, the freighter on the riverside sounded its whistle, and the truck and asphalt The sound of the road rubbing against each other was more lively than the Chongqing night market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 30, 2023, Huang Xiuli opened the window, and the noise and sunlight penetrated into the room.

In 1996, the annual transaction volume of the market here reached 3 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, on Chaodong Road where Bangbang lived, Peng Li, who was in charge of Chongqing Bishan Logistics, opened a freight order of more than 20,000 yuan a day. &quot;My joints hurt so much when I started to write,&quot; Peng Li said in pain and happiness. Liu You&#39;s first day&#39;s trade volume can reach more than 30,000 yuan. He describes his orders as being like a train pulling coal with no end in sight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Gao Zongqi also caught up with this wave of &quot;dividends&quot;. In the late 1990s, Gao Zongqi and Lao Zhao, who were from Qijiang, grew corn in their hometown. In the first year, they took their products to the city to sell them, but half of them were robbed before they even entered the city. They lost money. The next year, I took it to the city to sell it and made another loss. I heard that you can make money by helping people carry things in the city, so the couple picked up the stick and went to Chaotianmen. &quot;I can&#39;t read, so it&#39;s safer to be with my husband.&quot; This has been followed in Chaotianmen for 19 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the end of each year, the couple will receive a package fee of 10,000 yuan from their boss. Zhao laughed and said that he also gets a &quot;year-end bonus&quot; like white-collar workers. They relied on this &quot;year-end bonus&quot; to cover the expenses of returning home for the New Year. Gao Zongqi&#39;s parents praised their son-in-law for his promise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhao Dongqiu came to Chaotianmen for his son&#39;s wife Ben. Thirty years ago, Zhao Dongqiu and her husband opened a retail store in Anyue County, Sichuan. Although they made more money than farming, the couple was still worried about when they would be able to buy a house for their son and marry him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After chatting with someone, I learned that being a stick can make money quickly. The couple cut two sections of bamboo in their own mountain, scraped off the bamboo skin with a sickle, and wrapped the bamboo around them. We put on tape and nylon rope, bought tickets overnight, and arrived at Chaotianmen in the early morning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When he first came to Chaotianmen, Zhao Dongqiu&#39;s income was only two yuan a day. But she was not in a hurry and wandered around with the rope (rope) on her back. For four months, Zhao Dongqiu wandered around in Chaotianmen and found out about her own &quot;human society&quot;: Which family had a girl who was many years old, and which family had a miserable life. She knew clearly, &quot;We must first get familiar with the circle before others can shout It’s up to you, otherwise I can only work on a blank slate (not earning a penny).” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Slowly, 5 yuan, 10 yuan... more and more consignment notes entered Zhao Dongqiu&#39;s pocket. In 2003, the &quot;starting price&quot; of Bangbang was 15 yuan, and Zhao Dongqiu and her husband could get orders of more than 10,000 yuan in a month at most. When carrying goods, Zhao Dongqiu often wears jeans, a yellow shirt worth more than 30 yuan, and a thin gold necklace around his neck. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The cakes in Chaotianmen Comprehensive Trade Market are getting bigger and bigger, and there are more and more sticks. Chongqing University&#39;s 2010 &quot;Survey on the Living Conditions of Shancheng Bangbang Army&quot; showed that during the most prosperous period, there were approximately 400,000 Bangbangs in Chongqing, of which 3% were women. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Chongqing Chaotianmen Comprehensive Trading Market is the first stop for most people looking for work.

(Zheng Cailin/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Poet Fu Wei once described it this way: In Chongqing, when your friends are drunk, you can ask a stick to carry them back; for your girlfriend’s birthday, You can ask a group of Bangbangs to send flowers and sing a &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; song; if your pet encounters misfortune, you can ask Bangbangs to help cry...&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left ;&quot;>;Although they can make money, Bangbang people live frugally. Ms. Liu and her husband have run the only clinic on Chaodong Road for more than 30 years. In Liu’s impression, it was rare for Bangbang to come to see a doctor. Even if he did come, he would always prescribe some medicine for headaches and fever. “They were reluctant to pay for it. I prescribed a pack of Acafol powder for 10 cents, and he asked me if it could be cheaper. &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“The boss likes to find male bangbangs”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Female bangbangs are not popular in Chaotianmen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Gao Zongqi said that Huang Xiuli has a graceful appearance and does not look like a physical worker. There is no market for such a girl in Chaotianmen Bangbang. Once a boss thought she was a girl and couldn&#39;t afford the work, so Huang Xiuli would talk back: &quot;I can&#39;t afford it without paying!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;I can afford it.&quot; So what if you get up? You will be Bangbang for the rest of your life, and I will be the boss for the rest of your life.&quot; The sharp-tongued Huang Xiuli shut up when she heard this. Bangbang, who sells his strength, is inseparable from the boss&#39;s choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The boss likes to find men to bang.&quot; In this industry, physical strength means money. In the Chaotianmen Wholesale Market, bulk goods shopping malls prefer men with physical strength. &quot;They can earn more than 50 per cart, and I earn 30 per order, which is very little.&quot; Hard work can make up for weakness, so Huang Xiuli only has to make a few more trips. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Gao Zongqi was very envious of men who could carry toys. &quot;With a lot of money, he could carry my shoes three times in one trip.&quot; She came to Chaotian in 1998. Gate, the new Chongqing Chaotianmen International Shoe Center opposite Huang Xiuli carries goods. Gao Zongqi also discussed it with his boss, but the boss still asked Nan Bangbang next time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Gao Zongqi was not discouraged and packed his shoes honestly, &quot;Their men are too stupid to do such a delicate job.&quot; Every time he learned the amount to be packed, Gao Zongqi began to think about how to put the shoe boxes into the box as much as possible horizontally and vertically. If the stuffing is tight, it will affect the presentation; if the stuffing is wide, the top of the box cannot be sealed with glue, and another box may be wasted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The steps of Gao Zongqi&#39;s packing are like putting on makeup: first apply a base layer horizontally, then change the angle of the second layer to apply it over a large area, and finally apply it like filling acne pits , insert a few small shoe boxes into every slot, and finally seal them with glue and tie them. Gao Zongqi raised his &quot;knife&quot; and cut the packing rope in two. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Hands are easier to use than knives, but the speed must be fast, otherwise there will be blood.&quot; Gao Zongqi, who has been a &quot;bat player&quot; for 25 years, can always find the rope quickly The bifurcation point, quickly pull it off. After years of repeated movements, a groove appeared on the joint of Gao Zongqi&#39;s index finger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the last step of packaging is completed, Gao Zongqi is also responsible for &quot;after-sales&quot;, placing the remaining shoes of the shop owner, picking up the garbage, and then pulling the goods to Opposite the inn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Gao Zongqi and her husband pack shoes together.

(Zheng Cailin/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Female Bangbang will encounter sexual harassment. When they first came to Chaotianmen, Huang Xiuli and Lao Gao rented a house. On the first day they moved in, Bangbang, a man who lived across the street, saw Huang Xiuli and blurted out: &quot;What a good girl!&quot; and wanted to slap her butt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Bah! Even if I&#39;m not married, I won&#39;t be friends with you. If you don&#39;t know the door, just roll the ball.&quot; Huang Xiuli thinks she is a straight person, Don&#39;t hide your grievances. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The man was so persistent that at 9 o&#39;clock one night, he asked Huang Xiuli out under the pretext of transporting goods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;I believe you, who wants to transport goods in the middle of the night? If you try to trick me later, I will trick you first.&quot; Huang Xiuli usually has a quiet voice. It&#39;s big, but sharp and harsh. If it&#39;s a little higher, it can scare a table of men. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;The biggest fear is not being able to deliver the goods&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;No matter how difficult it is , Huang Xiuli never thought about quitting Bangbang, but it could not stop the industry from declining. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;She remembers clearly that after the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008, the Chaotianmen business was abandoned. “Many people were from Sichuan and Chongqing and went home. Everyone has no intention of making money anymore, their lives are at stake.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The &quot;aftershocks&quot; were delayed until 2010. Chaotianmen Wholesale Market was facing upgrading and comprehensive renovation, and many merchants had the idea of ​​​​moving out of Chaotianmen. &quot;Outside business has been abandoned, and fewer people are coming to buy goods.&quot; Liu Youtou recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;With the rise of logistics companies, the competition in the door-to-door express delivery service industry is intensifying. In addition, Chongqing’s rail transit is accessible in all directions and private cars are booming. It seems that everyone is competing for the &quot;Bang Bang&quot; rice bowl&quot;. There are fewer and fewer sticks carrying bamboo sticks on their shoulders and wandering the streets asking for work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2021, a survey on the living conditions of Bangbang in Chongqing released by the School of Journalism and Communication of Northwest University for Nationalities estimated that the number of Bangbangs in Chongqing has been less than 2,000, and most of them are elderly. Most people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Gao Zongqi and her husband worked together to carry goods. When they encountered a slope on the way, passers-by helped.

(Zheng Cailin/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But Gao Zongqi never thought about changing careers. &quot;I don&#39;t know anything, I can only contribute.&quot; Gao Zongqi is illiterate. She feels that she will be bullied by the maids in the restaurant, and it also depends on the boss&#39;s face, which Gao Zongqi doesn&#39;t like. She adapted to not having to &quot;punch in&quot; to work. &quot;Bangbang is free and has no one to care about. If you can afford it, take it. If you don&#39;t want to do it, rest.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Huang Xiuli doesn&#39;t want to go home either. &quot;It&#39;s hard to talk to a female Bangbang when she sees someone she knows.&quot; Relatives think that Huang Xiuli would be insulted if she worked as a Bangbang in the city. &quot;I don&#39;t feel embarrassed, but they always feel like something is wrong with you. How do they know I made a lot of money?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Huang Xiuli thought, can As long as you make money, the rest doesn&#39;t matter. &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter whether it&#39;s hard or not, the worst thing is that I won&#39;t be able to deliver the goods. I&#39;ll have to pay hundreds of dollars a day. Every time the money disappears before it&#39;s warm in my pocket.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot; text-align: left;&quot;>;Huang Xiuli did some calculations: the monthly mortgage of 4,000 yuan needs to be paid on time; her son is studying, and the living expenses of 800 yuan a month cannot be less; her daughter has given birth to a grandson, and neither husband nor wife has a job. , Huang Xiuli and Lao Gao provide 2,000 yuan per month. In order to occupy a place in the mall, Huang Xiuli also needs to pay 2,000 yuan &quot;land fee&quot; to the mall every year - occupying a 7-square-meter plot of 15 tiles, where Huang Xiuli&#39;s son sits and waits for his mother in his free time. Playing with mobile phones. Including water, electricity, property and food expenses, Huang Xiuli feels that it takes about 8,000 yuan per month to open her home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;September, October, and November every year are the replacement seasons of Chaotianmen Clothing Market. In previous years, it was also the golden period for Bangbang people to make money. But this year, there were no cargo loads after two or three days. According to Lao Zhao, you can’t even pay for water now. Liu Youtou also made up his mind to return to his hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Peng Li is still sitting on the small bench by the roadside, but now she can only issue freight orders of more than 2,000 yuan a day. Huang Xiuli often secretly picks up corrugated cardboard when she gets off work. Gao Zongqi still sits at Chaotianmen International Shoes Co., Ltd. waiting for goods at 6 o&#39;clock every day, and his breakfast has changed from two buds to one. &quot;If you don&#39;t have money to earn, don&#39;t eat in vain.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are fewer sticks, and there are even fewer female sticks. Southern Weekend visited and found that there are currently 8 female baseball players in Chaotianmen, 4 of whom are responsible for shoes in the new Chongqing Chaotianmen International Shoe Store, 1 is moving clothes in the third trading area of ​​the shopping mall, and 3 are mobile On Chaodong Road, it mainly transports foreign goods. There are four women in Sanxia Square, two of whom often wait for goods at the entrance of Chongqing New Century Supermarket, and two of whom follow their husbands everywhere to buy goods. There is a female stick worker at the Caiyuanba Bus Station. She closes her stall in the afternoon during the peak season and returns in the morning during the off-season. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When asked where the more female fans went and how many female fans there are in the area now, their answers were all &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; &quot;&quot;not sure&quot;. In other Bangbang gathering places such as Guanyinqiao, Baiyakou Street, Shibati, etc., Southern Weekend did not find any female Bangbangs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhao Dongqiu has already saved enough money for her son&#39;s daughter-in-law, but she still doesn&#39;t want to leave Chaotianmen. Someone once took a fancy to Zhao Dongqiu&#39;s cleverness and asked her to settle accounts, but Zhao Dongqiu declined, &quot;It&#39;s easier to have fun here, and you can blow everyone off (chat)&quot;. Zhao Dongqiu&#39;s goal now is to &quot;get off work&quot; after earning 100 yuan a day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Huang Xiuli still insists on going out every day to find work. Before going out in the morning, she would put homemade medicinal wine on her feet, believing that her home remedies would be more effective than seeing a doctor. &quot;Life is difficult, but I still hope that life will get better.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Except for Zhao Dongqiu, all names in the article are pseudonyms)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[陷入“以貌取人”困境的普通人]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259503]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;Weight, height, skin color, appearance... not only celebrities in the entertainment industry, but also ordinary people are increasingly falling into In anxiety about appearance.
