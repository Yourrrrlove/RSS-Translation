After this tweet was sent out, it immediately attracted ridicule and complaints from many Chinese netizens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The author has read the general content of this article. To be fair, this tweet is indeed full of errors and omissions. It is obviously stitched together by randomly searching a few Manchu-related articles on the Internet, and the materials used are of mixed quality. Manchu was the official language of the Qing Dynasty. At its peak, the population was more than 300 million. The expression &quot;the official language of a population of 300 million&quot; is not entirely wrong. But the numbers are still debatable. After all, the population in the late Qing Dynasty reached more than 400 million. In addition, there are far more serious errors in this tweet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, one of them says:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Although Manchu has disappeared, Mandarin is actually Mandarin. Chinese, Beijing dialect and Northeastern dialect have many Manchu sounds. The stains left behind after the clothes are stained with dirty things are called He Leng in Northeastern dialect, and the original meaning in Manchu is ripples of water. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The oil has gone bad. It is called &quot;Haweier&quot; in Beijing dialect, which comes from the Manchu har, and its original meaning is The spicy smell hits my nose. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Smoothing out wrinkled things is called Masa in Northeastern dialect, and the original meaning in Manchu is to stretch. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have been studying Manchu for a while, and it is not difficult to find that this large paragraph is full of fallacies: 1. The ripple in Manchu is irahi or iren, which is completely different from the pronunciation of &quot;he Leng&quot;. coherent. 2. The use of &quot;ha&quot; to describe the smell of spoiled oil is very common in Xiang, Wu, Min, and Southwest Mandarin. This is obviously a native Chinese word. The original character is (left stink and right harm). Because this character is so uncommon, it was written as the homophone &quot;ha&quot;. 3. As for the word &quot;Masa&quot; in Northeastern dialect, which means soothing, it is obviously the word &quot;Momo&quot;, and there is no doubt about its meaning and pronunciation. The Manchu word &quot;stretch&quot; is sarahvn, which is completely different from &quot;masa&quot; - you have to ask if there is any word in Manchu that has the same pronunciation as &quot;stroke&quot;, and it is true, but the Manchu word &quot;masa&quot; means to play on a swing. It means...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, if you search this paragraph online, you will find that it was copied from various self-media accounts. The original authors of these accounts, as well as the author of this tweet who copied them indiscriminately, obviously do not understand Manchu at all. I don’t know where they got these rumors from and made them up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Mandarin/Beijing/Northeastern dialect is Manchu Chinese&quot; is also a famous old rumor - linguists have long determined that there is basically no Manchu in Beijing dialect and Northeastern dialect. Vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation have not been influenced by Manchu. Missionaries who came to China during the Ming Dynasty recorded the Ming Dynasty Beijing dialect using Western alphabet spelling, and there was no obvious difference from modern Beijing dialect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, rumors like &quot;Manchu is everywhere in the Northeast&quot; are still very popular today. For example, the place name Changchun is often said to be the transliteration of the Manchu &quot;Cha Ah Chong&quot; - however, there is no word &quot;Cha Ah Chong&quot; in Manchu at all. The name of Changchun began with the establishment of &quot;Cha Ah Chong&quot; in Jilin during the Liao Dynasty. &quot;Changchun Prefecture&quot; is obviously a Chinese place name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you really want to count the Manchu words in Beijing dialect and Northeastern dialect, they basically only have nouns like &quot;Shaqima&quot;. However, this kind of vocabulary borrowing is inevitable. Cantonese and Hokkien also have the word Shaqima. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, if you think about it for a moment, you will understand that Manchu will not leave many traces in northern Chinese. This is just like there are basically no Aboriginal words in American English. There are no Austronesian features in Taiwanese Hokkien. Because Chinese is a language that has matured a long time ago and has a very rich and sufficient vocabulary, there is basically no need to borrow words. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If there are any concepts that are easier to express in Manchu, they are basically related to fishing and hunting. For example, there are many words in Manchu to describe pigs of different ages, dogs of different colors, and various methods of fishing... But neither the Han citizens in Beijing nor the Han farmers traveling to Guandong need to use these. Fishing and hunting vocabulary. In turn, Manchu words related to agriculture, industry and commerce, academia, and science and technology are basically borrowed from Chinese - for example, the Manchu word &quot;gong&quot; means &quot;gung&quot;, the word &quot;jin&quot; means &quot;gin&quot;, the word &quot;stone mill&quot; means &quot;mose&quot; (mill), and the word &quot;baby&quot; means boobai. ...all borrowed from Chinese. Another example is &quot;body&quot;. Most other Tungusic words are words like beye. But Manchu is ᠪᡝᠶᡝ ᡩᡠᡵᠰᡠᠨ=beye (body) + dursun (physique) = body...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chinese only used synonymous compounds for redundancy checking after the degeneracy of the medieval phonology system. In Manchu, beye is already a two-syllable word. Wouldn’t it be too verbose to add dursun? What’s even more amazing is that the Manchu word “child” is actually ᡶᡠᠯᡤᡳᠶᠠᠨ ᠵᡠᡳ (fulgiyan jui) – literally meaning “red fetus”...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although it is a little outrageous to understand child as a red fetus, But I can barely find some ancient books to support it. But the Manchu word for &quot;naked&quot; is also fulahvn beye (light red body), and &quot;barefoot&quot; is fulahvn bethe (light red legs). This is a completely literal mechanical translation, and the wrong meaning is chosen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Modern genetic testing has found that the Tungusic speaking populations (such as Hezhe, Xibe, Ewenki, Oroqen, etc.) are genetically consistent, but the Manchus are an exception - the Manchus have obvious blood differences with other Tungusic populations, but are more similar to the Han people There is basically no difference. A molecular anthropology institution tested 2,938 Manchus and found that only about 3% had Tungusic ancestry, even lower than their southern Han ancestry (6.57%). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The modern Manchus are basically indistinguishable from the Han in blood, which implies that the Manchus have intermarryed with the Han on a large scale over the past few hundred years, and in the end the Tungus bloodline was diluted to the point that it was negligible. Before the emergence of modern media and compulsory education, anyone’s mother tongue was learned through blood transmission. If every generation of a Manchu family intermarry with the Han people, the bloodline, language, customs, and culture of a group of people will not be any different from those of the Han people, and it will be difficult to distinguish them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is the author&#39;s personal opinion only and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[赵红程：无障碍通行，不只有轮椅人士需要]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256808]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-14 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font -family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;How to understand barrier-free access?

Recently, videos of young people from many places “commuting to get off work in electric wheelchairs” have appeared on social media, sparking heated discussions. Suddenly, accessibility became an issue of public concern and in urgent need of “management.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I really don’t understand how the topic ‘Young people focus on electric wheelchairs’ became so popular.” Zhao Hongcheng, an accessibility evaluation video blogger, expressed his doubts. As a former product manager of a major manufacturer, Zhao Hongcheng expressed his doubts. , she thinks this is obviously a marketing tool for businesses, &quot;Can you go out 100 meters in an electric wheelchair? Can people drive here? Open your eyes and take a look at the barrier-free facilities here. Let people who should go out first be able to go out. , and then think about how to &#39;manage&#39;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/uGJx4Wh4nUQk9YhMNtxKakJusCqNwtUHVsim7EIP.jpg&quot; border= &quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/uGJx4Wh4nUQk9YhMNtxKakJusCqNwtUHVsim7EIP.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250533&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For related reports, please see &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infzm.com/contents/250873&quot; title=&quot;The story of wheelchair girl Zhao Hongcheng &quot;Accessibility&quot; drama: Do I make you nervous? &quot;>;Wheelchair girl Zhao Hongcheng&#39;s &quot;Accessibility&quot; drama: Do I make you nervous? &lt;/a>; 》&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhao Hongcheng contracted polio when she was 1 year old and was in a wheelchair when she was in middle school. Today, she is quite skilled in wheelchair driving. She has been releasing videos on city accessibility assessments since 2019. After resigning from the Internet industry two years ago, she turned into a full-time video blogger. The video she produced, &quot;Black and Red List of Barrier-free Facilities,&quot; was once on Weibo&#39;s hot search list. So far, she has released more than a hundred urban accessibility assessment videos, covering Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Macau, and Taiwan, showing the daily life and travel obstacles encountered by people with disabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data from the China Disabled Persons&#39; Federation shows that as of 2022, the total number of disabled people in China will reach more than 85 million, accounting for more than 6% of the total population. However, they are rarely seen in public places. On June 28, 2023, the third meeting of the Standing Committee of the 14th National People&#39;s Congress voted to pass the Barrier-free Environment Construction Law. This law will come into effect on September 1, 2023. On March 1, 2023, the &quot;Shanghai Barrier-free Environment Construction Regulations&quot; came into effect. More and more people are aware of the importance of barrier-free environment construction, but it is not easy for the city&#39;s supporting system to keep up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a Shanghai accessibility evaluation video, when Zhao Hongcheng and her husband went to watch a talk show, they asked the theater staff about the location of the accessible toilets. The staff suggested that you can use diapers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhao Hongcheng believes that for-profit cultural and artistic venues such as art exhibitions and theaters are the &quot;hardest hit areas&quot; for accessibility. &quot;It seems that as a disabled person, you can confidently make demands when traveling on the subway, but in terms of cultural enjoyment, your confidence will be much weaker.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in the evaluation video, Zhao Hongcheng still tried Go swimming, go to Disney, go to Universal Studios, and document it on video. The inconvenience of legs and feet should not ultimately constitute difficulties in the entire living system of the disabled group because the city&#39;s supporting facilities are not in place. She hopes to promote the construction of barrier-free facilities in the country, and also hopes to bring people with disabilities, a long-marginalized social group, into the spotlight, be seen and have their own voice. &quot;Sometimes when I go out and walk on the street, I can find out from many people&#39;s expressions and questions that I am the first person in a wheelchair they have seen in their lives.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023 In May, the one-man drama &quot;Where is the nearest barrier-free toilet?&quot; based on Zhao Hongcheng. ” was staged at the Shanghai Grand Theater. It is the first domestic drama adapted from real people with disabilities. The first row of seats under the stage has been opened up as barrier-free wheelchair seats. Audiences in wheelchairs are seated in every performance, including 20 audience members in wheelchairs in one performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the stage, Zhao Hongcheng uses a dramatic performance to present her travel difficulties. Her daily travel is sometimes like an urban adventure: car horns, bus announcements, chaotic voices, and cars passing by. Amidst the noise, she drove her wheelchair around the city, not knowing which direction would be less obstructed. No matter how early she left her home, she was always late. Those praises for &quot;self-improvement&quot;, the prying eyes of strangers, the &quot;good intentions&quot; of others doing good, and the selective ignorance on more occasions... &quot;It seems that I always need to be constantly grateful.&quot; said Zhao Hongcheng, the lead actor in the drama and the prototype of the story. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Of all my expectations for this drama project, the most important point is that I need to make this happen. I want a story about people with disabilities to be staged in the theater.&quot; Successive dramas After the performance, Zhao Hongcheng felt that he finally had his own voice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This drama will be performed in Beijing on September 16. Zhao Hongcheng still pays attention to all information about barrier-free access on the Internet, and directly expresses his attitude towards some inexplicable pity, &quot;Give up being condescending and give up false concern, we should be friends!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/ p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx .net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt; /div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[打开神圣的脑袋，然后看到酸奶？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258555]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-14 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/13/guTmGuLhlDxsn6PvXLncoSm5LIiFtvTXlHrYe9hK.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/guTmGuLhlDxsn6PvXLncoSm5LIiFtvTXlH rYe9hK. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254029&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 2019, a craniotomy in Texas, USA. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I sometimes think of a boy I met in the hospital. He leaned at the window to check in and tried to pay a hefty deposit using WeChat. I asked the middle-aged woman behind me if I should line up behind her. She didn&#39;t quite understand and seemed a little timid. She was guarding a wheelchair that looked like an Iron Throne. There was a long metal rod sticking out of the back of the chair, and something seemed to be hanging on the top. There was a lot of luggage piled on the seat of the chair. The owner must have been transferred from out of town for medical treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The child was unable to pay the fee for a while, but fortunately the staff did not get upset and suggested him to check the limit in a business-like manner. His bones were obviously deformed, his back was severely twisted, and his skull was covered with a metal band. Thick metal wires are twisted at different locations on the hoop, and the one in the middle above the head is particularly tall. Looking at his back, he looks like an adult suffering from bone disease. After he paid the fee and turned around, I determined that he was a child slightly over ten years old. The woman and him should be mother and son, and the extra-sturdy wheelchair was probably made especially for him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a while while waiting to be admitted, I met the boy again. Because of the epidemic, the seats had to be spaced apart, so they were almost occupied, so I walked around to him. He pointed to the only empty seat next to him and made a friendly &quot;please sit down&quot; gesture. A child at such a young age is subjected to severe torture and yet appears to be sensible and self-respecting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With his mother by his side, he can take care of his daily life, but the paperwork involved probably won’t be of much help. The boy has to try for himself and slowly digest the good, evil and bleakness of the world. During the nucleic acid test, we talked about the child and became sad. I said he might be an astronaut, and now he has an antenna that can receive signals from outside. Hopefully it was a passable good-natured joke and he was actually memorable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After we were admitted to the hospital, I never met him again. It was only after I was discharged from the hospital that I determined that those steel brackets were specially used to help correct the bones. A few days ago, when I was about to finish reading &quot;Craniotomy: A Collection of Medical Stories that &quot;Turn on the Nerves&quot;&quot;, I found an illustration of a headband vest in the book, which was very similar to the system I saw two years ago. The Chinese version of this book was published in August 2023, and the original English version was published about a year ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Weird thing in my head&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The hospitalization was upgraded to a craniotomy at another hospital. I had a very large &quot;left middle cerebral artery aneurysm&quot; in my head that was compressing the left temporal lobe, which is responsible for language. I always think of the title of Pamuk&#39;s book &quot;The Strange Thing in My Head&quot;. The &quot;strange thing&quot; that belongs to me is like a pigeon egg. Its size and location are very rare. I don&#39;t know when it started growing secretly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am now particularly interested in patients, stories and social news about cerebrovascular diseases. People with cerebral hemorrhage are always racing against time, experiencing severe headaches they have never experienced before, and the most unfortunate people are experiencing the last days of their lives. In the news, people around them often don’t realize what is happening. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above are the reasons why I am particularly interested in &quot;Craniotomy&quot;. The author, Jay Wellens, is the chief physician of pediatric neurosurgery who has performed thousands of various surgeries. There are only 250 practicing physicians in this subspecialty in North America. He has mastered the art of performing neurosurgery on fetuses in the womb, helping them live healthy lives from birth. If the boy I met was so lucky, he would no longer face endless pain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Craniotomy&quot; does not have a strict main line. From time to time, he recalled his father who suffered from ALS. He was in his last year of medical school and &quot;about to embark on an extraordinary residency career&quot; when he discovered his father was ill. His father passed away suddenly a year later, which naturally made him empathize with the patients&#39; families. Nothing is closer to human nature than life and death, and fragmentary stories also contain huge spiritual power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the spring of his 15th year of practice, Dr. Wellens rescued a three-year-old boy who suffered a gunshot wound. He studied creative writing and calmly described the tragedy of the scene:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;During the emergency, the breathing tube was fixed Okay, the infusion tube has also been left in place. The boy&#39;s head was covered with half-coagulated blood, which pooled under his head and dripped to the ground like wax. As the crowd gathered around him, the bloody footprints became larger and larger. People came and went, holding bulging intravenous blood transfusion bags or saline, and syringes filled with medicine, all trying to help him stabilize. blood pressure. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Emergency rooms are always cruel. The child&#39;s head is beyond recognition and blood gushes out from several points on the edge of the bone. Wellens devotes three-quarters of a page to describing the tense situation, and it takes him only two seconds to see it all. It is a brain with a sophisticated structure (the author describes it as &quot;sacred&quot;). The feat in the eyes of readers is taken for granted by doctors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wellens participated in an operation to treat newborn twins who were joined at the back of their heads. They were born extremely premature and one of the children was in critical condition due to intestinal necrosis. The doctors decided to perform emergency separation, cut the skin, opened the skull and dura mater, and everything went well. But on the third hour of the operation, they suddenly suffered a massive hemorrhage, and eventually all blood flow stopped. He would always remember crying as he resewed the twins back together to give his parents a chance to hold them again. &quot;We should have sacrificed one to save the other, but we wanted to save both, and both died.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Wellens also wrote about mentors who died young and angry patients. Family members, testimonies for victims of quackery, and paranoia about their children’s medical conditions. Along with some less dramatic scenes, he draws inspiration from everyday life. On the one hand, it reflects his wisdom, on the other hand, it is simply the power brought by medicine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are two stories that impressed me deeply. They are both humorous and touching. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wellens often answers questions from adults and children: What does the brain look like? He would answer: &quot;Like yogurt. Creamy vanilla-flavored yogurt.&quot; Then add: &quot;Like very thick yogurt, the kind where the spoon can stand upright in it.&quot; Everyone&#39;s reaction is likely to be: Oh, this topic That&#39;s it for now. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, he went on to expertly describe the land flowing with milk and honey he saw after the craniotomy:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;This is a sight that not many people have seen before. It will seem strange at first, and the surface of the moon was no different to its early visitors. But unlike the lunar surface, which is a barren gray, the surface of the human brain is awash with color and luster, full of dimension and depth. It takes a moment for your eyes to adjust to the sudden brightness. The surface of the brain is very smooth, indeed cream-colored, with only a faint hint of yellow. It shines under the reflection of the microscope...&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another story happened when he was chief resident. He often goes to the department director late at night to &quot;check the list&quot; to understand the patient&#39;s condition and then arrange the next treatment plan. One night, he saw the director outside the office carefully flipping through an anatomy textbook and reviewing the parts for tomorrow&#39;s surgery. Next, he also reviewed anatomy during the final hours of the night before surgery. &quot;This has become a ritual.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The Lost Day&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Including anesthesia time, my own surgery took about fourteen hours , there will always be a shallow trench left on the left side of the head. I call this day &quot;The Lost Day.&quot; So I read the craniotomy cases very carefully, looking for clues that lasted more than ten hours. I didn&#39;t understand before how the skull opened and in what direction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the endearing things is what Wellens said: &quot;I removed my first aneurysm and passed the rite of passage as a surgical resident.&quot; I couldn&#39;t fully understand what he explained again and again. nervous system. However, when I saw that the Latin name of dura mater means &quot;strong mother&quot;, the shock of discovering the truth was beyond words, like a wake-up call. By the way, the English words &quot;doctor&quot; and &quot;patient&quot; come from the Latin words &quot;teach&quot; and &quot;patient&quot; respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first thing I heard when I woke up was the intern doctor chatting with his colleagues, saying that I was a reporter, and talking about their overtime wages. The operating table was a little bumpy as it left the elevator, and I fell asleep again. When I woke up, I was in the ICU, a hall-like place with curtains, and occasionally people walking around. When the nurse was about to leave work, I bled a lot. I fell asleep and woke up alternately. Early in the morning, an elderly doctor took off my oxygen tube. There are equipment such as shadowless lights set up above the hospital bed, much like an operating room. I asked a nurse on patrol if the equipment was real. She turned her head and looked up, but did not answer the question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Are these all true? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next step was edema from surgery. My appearance was beyond recognition and frightened some people close to me. I couldn&#39;t use my phone anymore, and I couldn&#39;t type a grammatical sentence into my phone. Over and over, each five-minute round, I surrendered in frustration. Emoji has become one of the greatest inventions in the world. These simple and crude symbols have become the only communication channel between you and the distant place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few days later, I started watching the second season of &quot;Secret Forest&quot; on my iPad. Sometimes I even felt that I could understand Korean, but I couldn&#39;t tell the difference between reading the subtitles and listening to the dialogue. Don’t forget, this season is about the struggle between prosecutors and police that may be difficult for Korean viewers to understand. I often mention this hallucination for fun. Needless to say, it was really a surprise at the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few days after the surgery I read the autobiography of neurologist Oliver Sacks, and in those pages it seemed like he was coming out. I turned the autobiography to the cover and showed it to Sun Liyong, the visiting surgeon, to show how amazing my recovery was. But I gave up halfway and never opened this book again after I was discharged from hospital. I have long been fond of Sachs’s books that explore the mysteries of brain nerves, and I should continue to read them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I opened the book, it turned out that what I read was the third chapter &quot;Wolf Boy&quot;. The beginning of the paragraph is unruly:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In broad daylight, I am the friendly Dr. Sachs in white robe;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;But when night falls, I will take off my white robe, put on my motorcycle leather jacket, and remain anonymous.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Sneaking out of the hospital like a wolf, wandering the streets, or riding the winding roads up Mount Tamalpais,&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font- family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Then, under the moonlight, we drove all the way to Stinson Beach. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After discharge, there will be language training and hyperbaric oxygen inhalation. The oxygen chamber is like a submarine. Administrators and doctors can see people taking oxygen through small round windows. There was a bald man who would laugh involuntarily, laughing endlessly, contagiously making everyone laugh. There was no sound when he laughed. Think of the scene in the movie where the sound suddenly disappears and everyone only opens their mouths but cannot hear the words. I can&#39;t remember how the man stopped. He was usually silent and had not yet recovered from his stroke. It was his wife who spoke, telling how his cerebrovascular disease recurred many years after its onset. She and the other wives have always shown extraordinary steadfastness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After I took oxygen, I often went to a New Element restaurant to eat salads and drink juice, and got to know the staff. However, this comforting restaurant closed down during the epidemic. There were sixty nails driven into my head, the shape of which looked like staples. After a while, a serious and professional nurse removed them, thirty pills at a time. After tearing off the tape on my head, I shivered for about half a minute, probably like a calf trembling when it is born. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first scene of aphasia became increasingly blurry, and the &quot;strange thing&quot; was discovered a year later. The words in my head were very clear and grammatical, but what came out of my mouth was just a meaningless sound of Ulu Uru. Does it sound like a crow? During the period when my aphasia became more and more frequent, I whispered &quot;Eat grapes without spitting out grape skins&quot; from time to time to test whether I could speak normally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Long after surgery, fear occasionally strikes. It is invisible and fades quickly. Anyway, those brave young people in &quot;Open Skull&quot; are definitely my role models. When I see aneurysm patients in books and in real life, I will secretly identify them as the same kind. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;His soul also slowly lost consciousness&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Jerome Groopman recalled in his book review for The New Yorker The work of doctors. From pediatrician Perry Klass&#39;s memoir about the life of a medical student, &quot;Not Completely Benign Surgery,&quot; to British surgeon Henry Marsh&#39;s self-analysis of the mistakes he made during his more than thirty years of practice, &quot;The Doctor&#39;s Choice.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then, &quot;Craniotomy&quot; written by Wellens when he was practicing medicine for more than 20 years can be placed between these two books. Interestingly, Marsh is also skilled in neurosurgery and adheres to the self-requirement of &quot;Strictly Do No Harm&quot; (that is, the English version of the book is titled, Do No Harm). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Undoubtedly, the brain is the key to human beings. Medicine, on the other hand, clearly connects life and death, humanity, and pain, and its connections to other things are less straightforward but not unexpected, such as literature. The combination of medicine and literature is so fascinating that Wellens begins the book with a quote from &quot;The Dead&quot; in &quot;Dublins&quot;:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;He listened to the snow falling softly everywhere in the world, falling softly, just as they fell towards their final destination, falling on all the living and the dead; his soul also slowly fell. Slowly lost consciousness. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the aforementioned conjoined twins who tragically died, Groopman thought of Richard Selzer&#39;s short story &quot;Imelda.&quot; Seltzer, a surgeon and author, was &quot;one of the first physicians to understand the power of writing and reading novels in medicine&quot; and had mentored John Irving. In the novel, a cold, arrogant and perfectionist American surgeon goes to Honduras on a charity mission and plans to operate on Imelda, a girl with a cleft palate, but the girl dies of anesthesia complications before the operation. The doctor sneaked into the morgue at night and completed the operation on the corpse so that the mother could bury her daughter after treatment. Doctors are left devastated and unable to recover from unsatisfactory results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, Wellens accepted the encouragement from his mentors and friends, got over his frustrations, and understood human limitations. You can&#39;t do everything, but you can understand your limitations and do better. In addition to serving as an attending physician, he also obtained a master&#39;s degree in epidemiology. “This degree opened up a whole new dimension in my life, and I started to study the disparities in care received by children in neurosurgery based on race, socioeconomic status and gender.” At the same time, he also focused on the proliferation of guns, vaccine skepticism and many other social issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rita Cullen, professor of internal medicine at Columbia University, proposed the concept of &quot;narrative medicine&quot;, which is medicine practiced by clinicians with narrative abilities. Narrative competence is the ability to recognize, absorb, interpret, and be moved by stories about illness. Groopman singles out two doctor&#39;s short stories, Chekhov&#39;s &quot;The House Call&quot; and William Carlos Williams&#39;s &quot;The Girl with Acne,&quot; that explore the interaction between patients and their surroundings. Of course, Chinese readers should more easily think of Lu Xun, who &quot;abandoned medicine to pursue literature.&quot; Doctors keenly observe and accurately express the truth of the world, inviting the public to think, and extending individual changes to the entire society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One day when I was writing this book review, I accidentally discovered Dr. Sun’s Douyin account that popularizes medical knowledge, and I watched it one by one for a long time. In addition to short videos about clinics and cases, he also blessed college entrance examination candidates and talked about the long road medical students will face. When I was about to leave the clinic after a follow-up consultation, he mentioned the German drama &quot;Charité Hospital&quot; he had watched. On the eve of returning to the bustling corridor, I seemed to have received an Easter egg from the doctor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 13:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[2024国考明起开始报名，共计划招录3.96万人]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258599]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-14 10:43:57&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The reporter learned from the National Civil Service Bureau that registration for civil servants to be recruited for the 2024 examinations of central agencies and their directly affiliated agencies is about to begin. It plans to recruit 39,600 people. Candidates can log in to the &quot;Special Website for Civil Servants Recruited for the 2024 Examination of Central Agencies and Their Directly Affiliated Agencies&quot; from 8:00 on October 15 to 18:00 on October 24 (http://bm.scs.gov.cn/kl2024) Register online and the public subject written examination will be held simultaneously on November 26 in all municipalities, provincial capitals, autonomous region capitals and some larger cities across the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The recruitment of civil servants in this examination mainly has three characteristics: First, political standards should be put first and the political requirements of newly recruited personnel should be highlighted. Among them, the content of the written test and interview highlights the political attributes of civil servants, focusing on testing the ability to use the party&#39;s innovative theory to guide analysis and problem solving; testing comprehensively understands the candidates&#39; morality, ability, diligence, performance, and integrity, focusing on understanding political quality and moral conduct , compliance with laws and regulations, etc. Politically unqualified candidates will not be hired. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is that recruitment policies and recruitment plans are tilted towards grassroots front-line workers and college graduates. Set up 26,000 plans specifically to recruit fresh college graduates, serve and promote the employment of college graduates. Nearly 27,000 plans have been supplemented to directly-affiliated agencies at the county (district) level and below. The application conditions for grassroots positions in difficult and remote areas will be appropriately adjusted based on actual conditions such as academic qualifications, majors, working years and experience, so as to further enrich the grassroots civil servants. More than 3,000 targeted recruitment programs have been set up to serve grassroots project personnel and retired soldiers who have served in the military for more than 5 years as college graduates, encouraging and guiding talents to flow to the grassroots and actively participate in national defense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third is to adhere to classified examinations for recruitment. The examination content is set according to the characteristics of different job categories and different levels of agencies. The interview method and content will be determined by the recruitment agency based on the nature and characteristics of the position being recruited, with emphasis on reflecting the performance requirements. Some recruitment agencies test and evaluate candidates&#39; professional abilities. 9 departments organize written examinations of professional subjects during the written examination stage, and 40 departments organize professional ability tests during the interview stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the National Civil Service Bureau reminds candidates to register with integrity, prepare with integrity, take exams with integrity, and keep promises with integrity. This recruitment does not publish or specify exam tutoring books, nor does it hold or entrust any institution or individual to hold exam tutoring training classes. Regarding civil servant examination training, websites or publications in the society, candidates are requested to be vigilant and treat them rationally to avoid being deceived and prevent damage to their rights and interests. The National Civil Service Bureau will work with relevant departments to strengthen management and supervision, crack down on cheating in exams, investigate and deal with violations, and create a fair, just, safe and orderly exam environment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[广州野生动物放生规定来了，随意放生或负刑责！这些动物在列]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258507]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-14 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The &quot;Guangzhou Wildlife Release Management Regulations&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Regulations&quot;) will be implemented on November 1, 2023 Effective from today. It is understood that the &quot;Regulations&quot; combine the actual conditions of Guangzhou to establish a practical management system for the release of wild animals to protect biosecurity and the ecological environment. It is the first local regulation in China to specifically regulate the release of wild animals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, the &quot;Regulations&quot; set specific penalties for the illegal release of overseas wild animal species, the random release of domestic wild animals that may or has caused serious consequences, and the release of domestic wild animals in other places outside the release area. . Before citizens can legally release animals, they must register information three working days in advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The legislation aims to scientifically regulate the release of animals&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Prevent the invasion of alien species&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;/blockquote >; &lt;p>;The No. 1 Central Document in 2023 proposed to severely crack down on the illegal introduction of alien species, implement key actions to prevent and control major harmful invasive species, and strengthen the standardized management of the trade and release of &quot;exotic pets&quot;. This is also the first time that the word &quot;release&quot; is mentioned in the No. 1 Central Document. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Releasing animals to pray for blessings is a traditional Chinese folk culture. However, in modern society, due to the diversity and complexity of released species and their source areas, inappropriate release behaviors have brought many problems to the environment, ecology, biology, society and people themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/741a7c92d83c7e54f97f570272efd5d7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;406&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/741a7c92d83c7e54f97f570272efd5d7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253993&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Alligator gar (Atractosteus spatula).

If non-native wild animals are released into the local environment, the new species may compete with native species for food and living space. Alien species with strong reproductive capabilities or ferociousness will threaten the living space of native species and harm the local ecosystem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/8648eebe1467d4bd9bdabcac4172d2be.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/8648eebe1467d4bd9bdabcac4172d2be.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253991&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The short-capped fat carp (Piaractus brachypomus), commonly known as freshwater pomfret.

If poisonous, ferocious or unquarantined wild animals are released into the wild environment, they may attack humans or other animals, and the viruses and bacteria they carry may also spread through waters or other channels, causing harm to other people&#39;s personal property and the ecological environment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, wild animals that have not been trained for rewilding can easily lead to death when released into the wild. If wild animals that have not been trained for rewilding are released into the wild or into a wild environment that is not suitable for survival, they may not be able to survive and die. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the person in charge of the Legal Affairs Committee of the Guangzhou Municipal People’s Congress Standing Committee, in 2022, the Guangzhou Municipal People’s Congress Standing Committee conducted a law enforcement inspection on the implementation of the “Wildlife Protection Law of the People’s Republic of China”. During the law enforcement inspection, it was found that release activities are common in some places, but there are no corresponding management regulations. In particular, there is a lack of effective management measures for the release of invasive alien species such as alligator gar and scavengers, which seriously damages the balance of the local ecosystem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person in charge of the Legal Affairs Committee said that the current national laws and regulations on ecological protection and wildlife protection, such as the &quot;Biosecurity Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; and the &quot;Wildlife Protection Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot;, only allow the release of wild animals. Principled provisions have been made, but there is a lack of operable norms. In order to scientifically regulate the release of wild animals and prevent the invasion of alien species, special legislation is necessary. Therefore, the Standing Committee of the Guangzhou Municipal People’s Congress will include this regulation into the 2023 legislative work plan. &lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Releasing wild animals at will may result in fines or even criminal liability&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Citizens must register information three working days in advance to legally release wild animals&lt;/strong>; strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;In order to standardize the release behavior and prevent the invasion of alien species from damaging the local ecosystem, the &quot;Regulations&quot; clarify that overseas wild animals cannot be released unless otherwise provided by laws and regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to let the public know clearly which animals cannot be released, the &quot;Regulations&quot; also lists some of the more common exotic wild animal species, such as alligator gar, leopard catfish, Tilapia tilapia, Freshwater pomfret, mosquito fish, Egyptian frogfish, Thai dace, giant snapping turtle, red-eared turtle, American bullfrog, etc. Not only this, but other overseas wild animals not listed here cannot be released. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/f0308e5e31f51a3c1bcbf2b0304c521a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/f0308e5e31f51a3c1bcbf2b0304c521a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253992&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Red-eared turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans).

Image source: Scientific fish release expert team of China Fisheries Society&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person in charge of the Legal Affairs Committee said that when wild animals are released, local species suitable for survival in the wild should be selected, and the normal life and production of residents must not be interfered with. Causing personal or property damage to others or endangering the ecosystem. The list of local species suitable for survival in the wild at the release site will be formulated and published by the Guangzhou Forestry Department and the Guangzhou Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department and updated in due course. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Releasing wild animals at will is an illegal act, and one must bear corresponding legal responsibilities.” The person in charge of the Legal Affairs Committee said that for the act of releasing wild animals at will, laws and regulations distinguish three situations and stipulate them respectively. The first is to stipulate penalties for illegally releasing overseas wild animal species. It will be handled mainly in accordance with the relevant provisions of laws and regulations such as the Biosafety Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China and the Wildlife Protection Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the &quot;Regulations&quot; set specific penalties for situations where the random release of domestic wild animals may or has caused serious consequences. That is to say, it is stipulated that if any person may or has caused personal or property damage to others or harmed the ecosystem, the relevant department shall order him to capture it within a time limit; if he still fails to capture it after the expiration of the time limit, and may or has harmed the ecosystem, the district forestry department and the district agriculture and rural department shall Those who capture or take measures to reduce the impact on their behalf shall bear the costs required by the releasing organization or individual; if the ecosystem has been harmed, a fine of not less than RMB 10,000 but not more than RMB 100,000 shall be imposed; if it causes personal or property damage to others, the releasing organization or individual shall Individuals shall bear corresponding civil responsibilities in accordance with the law; if a crime is constituted, criminal liability shall be pursued in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the &quot;Regulations&quot; set penalties for releasing domestic wild animals in places other than the release area. That is, if the animals are not released at the prescribed location, the district forestry department or the district agriculture and rural department will impose a fine of not less than 2,000 yuan but not more than 10,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that the &quot;Regulations&quot; also provide guidance on legal release behaviors. The person in charge of the Legal Affairs Committee said that citizens must comply with three regulations when releasing animals legally: Before releasing animals, citizens must select animal species suitable for release based on the local species list published by relevant departments. At the same time, information such as pictures, types, quantities, sources, release time and location of wild animals need to be uploaded to the wild animal release information management platform three working days in advance, and the release should be carried out based on information feedback from relevant departments and scientific and standardized release guidelines. When releasing wild animals, citizens need to go to the wild animal release areas designated by the government and release them according to the guidelines and registration information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[为灵活就业准备了四年，还是进了职场丨记者手记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258569]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-14 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/13/5LO0wHjrJvdtDnMmt7mMmUUSFK4Y9RXb9dsvDl40.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;833&quot; height=&quot;781&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/5LO0wHjrJvdtDnMmt7mMmUUSF K4Y9RXb9dsvDl40. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253999&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Nongjian/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For related reports, please see &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infzm.com/contents/256675 &quot; title=&quot;&quot;Flexible employment&quot; graduates, and a round of targeted verification&quot;>;&quot;Flexible employment&quot; graduates, and a round of targeted verification&lt;/a>;》&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The earliest idea of ​​starting a business It came out on a tropical afternoon in 2017. At that time, I was at the largest market in Yangon. Its name was changed to Aung San Market in 1948. The foreign name used during the colonial period is unknown. The change of name did not bring about a change in architectural style. The colonial ocher-colored roofs and smooth cobblestone paths are easily reminiscent of George Orwell&#39;s years as a police officer in Burma. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The entire market counter is occupied by wood, amber, emerald, ruby ​​and a golden pearl. At that time, my senior intern at the newspaper office took me to the shop of a timber owner with both Chinese and Burmese ancestry. The wood she and her husband operated, in addition to the local Burmese rosewood, small-leaf rosewood and old sandalwood came from next door. of Indian neighbours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I can’t imagine why so much precious wood is allowed to be cut down, but she once described to me in broken Chinese that there is a dense and compact rosewood forest on the border of India and Myanmar. The level is sufficient to meet the needs of the Chinese people. After all, Westerners are often attracted by the national costumes and paintings of young painters in Aung San Market. These shops are located on the periphery of the market, in large sheds set up casually under ocher roofs. Only the Chinese would delve into the heart of the market in search of treasure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These hard-working Burmese people process the wood into chopsticks and beads. Even if you observe carefully under the sun, you will notice that many beads are like pebbles, thinner or fatter, and not beautiful. Round. But it cannot be said that it is cheap. As long as it is brought back to China, the price can be doubled several times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before returning to China, I emptied my suitcase and left many unused books and medicines with my friends in Myanmar. In the end, I returned to China with a suitcase full of wood, and quickly sold it within a month. I brought a few classmates with me to make a small profit, and I continued to purchase goods two or three times in the next six months. Until Myanmar introduced strict timber import and export laws. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The charm of business lies in negotiation, and bargaining is an art of gaming. This process can be extremely relaxing, especially when customers think about your products over and over again. You will feel that the early research and search are worth the money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Soon, three years of graduate school life made me think about selling tea again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was in Chengdu at the time, and the strong local tradition of drinking tea made me think I had discovered a blue ocean. It would also be a good idea to bring the Pu&#39;er tea from my hometown to Chengdu and serve as a supplier to some teahouses. In addition to taking classes, I hung out in various teahouses in Chengdu every day, made friends, and held tea parties. After casually reading a few tea-related books, I started a tea class. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I once thought that this would be my future life. Your daily job is to chat with customers, and then think about stories for your products one after another. Occasionally, during the Spring Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival, prepare souvenirs for customers in advance, visit them one by one, control the quality of the tea, and be vigilant. The emergence of competitors. Most of the people in this circle are introverted. Some people get rich suddenly, but no one spends lavishly. Most of them live in poverty, and the standard of living can be very low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most important thing is that making tea gives you the freedom of poverty. Even if you are a teahouse owner with a mediocre business, you will still travel to tea mountains in various places during the spring tea season and stay in tea farmers&#39; homes. The cost for tea farmers to receive customers exceeds the cost for customers to buy tea. However, in the next spring tea season, tea farmers will still catch fish and kill chickens every day to entertain guests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, when I was applying for a job at a cultural company, I told the manpower that I could live with low desires, but the manpower refuted it. If you have no desire, then you are inefficient for the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2022, I have successively written several articles related to employment. When communicating with college students who intend to find flexible employment or even slow employment, I can see myself in the past, the kind that always The desire to remain longing for the possibilities of life and not want to be absorbed by a standard, modern corporate system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, most students with a journalism background know that recruitment by news organizations often begins in the second semester of their senior year or third year of graduate school. When the classmates around you who want to go to big Internet companies get their acceptance notices in the fall, a person who is determined to work in journalism will fall into the worry of having nothing to do. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just before the end of that autumn, the things I was thinking about were still doing things I like and doing things that make life infinitely possible. When I sent a resume to a start-up company with a strong literary and artistic atmosphere, I also wrote this paragraph: Looking for a job naturally requires some self-hypnosis skills, especially when a group of people in the same dormitory have already gone to Shenzhen to do annual salary work. 300,000 yuan, a teacher who claims to be able to buy a house in the urban area within 5 years; or working as a salesperson in a real estate company with a monthly salary of 20,000 yuan, I kept silently saying to myself: don&#39;t worry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in fact, before spring comes, this lack of urgency has disappeared. The first time I felt peer pressure was one night when my old dormitory friends came back to school to get together. When the others learned that I had not even received the interview notice, they who had already found a job took a breath unconsciously, and there was a look in their eyes. Show compassion. I wanted them to stop looking like that right away, so I told them that the recruitment for news organizations hadn’t started yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later I thought about it and realized that this sentence was meant for myself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I believe that nowadays, if you only look at the data on flexible employment in some colleges and universities, then peer pressure may no longer exist. When people around you are in flexible employment or slow employment, graduation is a long time. A small part of the power to collect vacations is in one&#39;s own hands, and the other part is controlled by an abstract and intangible existence that can be called &quot;society&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For students who truly intend to find flexible employment, they are more surrounded by entrepreneurial myths from the 1980s or 2010s. Not long ago, a post-00s friend asked me seriously how to sell tea through short videos. This was his wish after graduation, but he had no idea about the short video editing methods, the method of starting the number, the script structure, and the benchmarking account. learn. After I introduced them all, he said that it was too complicated and was there something simpler? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The elders in Yunnan in my hometown have a very traditional idea, that is, after graduation, even if they cannot find a good job, they have to find a temporary job in a small company. Otherwise, in Yunnan dialect, People are floating. Flexible employment may make you rich overnight, and slow employment may bring you endless possibilities in life, but the real world is changing rapidly. After three years of online classes, being included in an organizational system, isn’t it a way to understand the real world? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for me, the last time the Burmese timber boss I met sent me a message, she said she was going to India to see the endless red sandalwood forest and reduce the purchase cost. This was already five years ago. conversation years ago. Before getting the job offer notice, several Chengdu teahouse owners whom I knew well had already changed careers. They fell in love with essential oils, massage and traveling respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the real world that flexible employment needs to face. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[七堇年：时间不多，玩了再说]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258583]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-14 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/11/dmLaXWsd6pjuYLL4Gpq3kyJRZS9iLevOWd5FyXOJ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/dmLaXWsd6pjuYLL4Gpq3kyJRZS9iLev OWd5FyXOJ. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253689&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the respondent/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is easy to be alone, but it is hard to escape social interaction when sharing the air with others for a long time. I have been publishing works since I was in high school, and I am still living a seemingly unemployed life in my thirties. I always feel embarrassed when faced with inquiries from strangers. When she went to the barber shop and lay down to wash her hair, sooner or later a routine question came from the top of her head: &quot;What do you do?&quot; Sometimes she answered the teacher, sometimes she said it was sales, she said whatever came to her mind, but she couldn&#39;t tell the truth, and sometimes she said it was sales. There are no pre-programmed complete answers. Once the other party asked, she was helpless and allowed the sound of running water to flow by awkwardly. If you can’t answer it, I won’t make it up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The funniest time in my memory came from a fellow traveler I met when I was paragliding. The other person asked you what you were doing? Qi Jinnian answered in Sichuan dialect, &quot;I work in publishing.&quot; Since the pronunciation was similar, the other party then asked sincerely, &quot;How much does the best kitchen board cost per meter now?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This encounter made me even more sad. Qi Jinnian is convinced, &quot;Publishing or books are something that is far away from normal people, let alone saying that you are a writer. I would think it would be too weird to tell others that you are writing.&quot; She lives her life like a covert spy. In bustling Chengdu, I write in the morning, read in the afternoon, and sometimes go to the gym to exercise, and then come back in the evening to watch movies and read books. I don’t cook, but it’s hard to tell my friends from out of town about restaurant recommendations. She is used to blanching vegetables over high heat, and then ordering takeout from a limited number of restaurants that suit her taste. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/6L3eeOGIdCZDmkV3LLsj1DToDa7r7e0VcFk0hvY7.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/6L3eeOGIdCZDmkV3LLsj1DToDa7r7e0VcFk0hvY7.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253688&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hiking everywhere&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It doesn’t matter whether you stay home or not , &quot;We really don&#39;t care.&quot; She is more concerned about the world outside the dozens of square meters of space. When the weather is nice, I go paragliding alone, and during holidays I go caving and rock climbing with my teammates. She joined the Shanshui Nature Conservation Center a few years ago and also threw herself to different Hengduan Mountains during the COVID-19 epidemic. The older she gets, the more animalistic nature emerges in her heart. Her yearning and primitive desire for nature have become a stronger attachment than emotion. She jokes that she has transformed into a &quot;part-time human being.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Irish female writer Claire Geoghegan (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;translated one of her short story collections &quot;Fostering&quot;&lt;/p>; span>;) wrote a passage, which happens to be very suitable to describe her. &quot;Writing is a strange profession, especially at my age. They mentally calculate how old I am, trying to remember what happened when I was born and who died. They can&#39;t be sure, but I&#39;m definitely not a little girl anymore. I You should do something else now, and tie yourself to an unmarried man with a stable income and a good car.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Qijing Nian, writing is not a dream planned since childhood. When I was less than 20 years old, my work &quot;The Bed Is the Tomb of Youth&quot; sold a million copies, and things happened suddenly. Thinking about it now, she really wants to have the life of a sports star. When she meets a child who is good at climbing in the rock climbing gym, she will feel jealous and then get upset, &quot;What did I do when I was a child? 9 to 12 years old is the most suitable for rock climbing. He is very light in weight and of the right size. If he has this kind of hobby, that would be great!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She sincerely envied Federer&#39;s life. &quot;When he retired, he was probably only in his thirties. After you have reached the pinnacle of your career, your life is actually still very long.&quot; It is obviously difficult for writers to end abruptly at this age. In September 2023, her collection of travel essays &quot;Crossing the Wandering Road&quot; was published. She had not published a book for the previous three years. During this period, she had to face the social expectations of editors and readers. She and artist Chen Xiaoyi traveled together in the Hengduan Mountains. Along the way, the two occasionally discussed the invisible publishing rhythm of each other&#39;s work. &quot;Artists like them also have to hold solo exhibitions or participate in group exhibitions every year to maintain a career.&quot; Online status.

It takes as much time to revise as it does to write. &quot;Crossing the Waves&quot; took at least a year to revise, and I kept looking for the structure again and again.&quot; Objective Difficulty Increase, there is also some subjective psychological resistance. &quot;I&#39;m over 35 years old, and my growth has changed a lot. This kind of creative rhythm is also a kind of discipline given to me by society. Rather than writing a book every year, what I&#39;m more worried about now is how to take advantage of my health. When you are good, you can experience more various sports and life. In fact, the older you get, the more you shrink. Because writing can last a lifetime, but if you want to do some outdoor sports, or even just climb a mountain, By the time you are sixty or seventy years old, your body will be incomparable to what you were in your twenties and thirties.&quot; Her most ideal life state is to &quot;travel around the world in the first 30 years, study in the next 30 years, and concentrate on writing in the last 30 years.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;The following is her autobiography:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Destiny is like raindrops&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I set foot on My professional writing path started relatively early, and I think it has been well-known to many readers.

You cannot expect a 17-year-old Kids wrote &quot;War and Peace,&quot; right? It’s not that what I’m writing now is “War and Peace”, it’s just that I’m actually quite helpless about this process.

I thought it was quite normal to meet readers in China, but I didn’t expect that I could meet them in such a far away place, which really moved me. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/aV2tu07sPsZN2zibW0qi0TKIMsCDocLsamlKOc14.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 607&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/aV2tu07sPsZN2zibW0qi0TKIMsCDocLsamlKOc14.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253685&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Cave exploration&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I think it was because of the new concept essay contest (I don’t know if the new concept still exists now). At that time, our &quot;post-80s&quot; generation was still very popular. Sensational. I participated in the sixth session, my sophomore year in high school (2002). After winning the award, I was very lucky to join Guo Jingming’s team and caught up with the wave of that type of literature, so it was quite smooth along the way.

Look, this is a book I published!” &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;At first, I really wrote casually. During self-study in the evening, others were doing homework, and I was writing.

The previous book &quot;Crossing the Wandering Road&quot; was the 2019 &quot;Evening Breeze Pillow Wine&quot;. This book is mainly to give me the previous three years. An explanation. During the three years of the epidemic, I think it may have been difficult for everyone, and everyone has their own understanding. For me, the biggest thing is that after the normal order of life is disrupted, you find that what seems orderly is actually quite fragile, and you may be powerless about it and can only accept impermanence. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/0bz6Cl8Ong2mQM9o3jU8GLR44poAeCWfreFETxZO.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 643&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/0bz6Cl8Ong2mQM9o3jU8GLR44poAeCWfreFETxZO.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253677&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Since I have been very fond of nature and travel since I was a child, and I am afraid of heat, I basically go to national parks in other countries every summer. , driving, camping, and climbing all the way, completely in nature.

During the epidemic, it was impossible to go to all of them. Fortunately, Sichuan Province is really big and rich in natural resources. In the past, I didn’t even realize that the Hengduan Mountains in my hometown were so rich in landforms. So in the past three years, I have looked around me with a withdrawn look and found that it turned out that Maybe you don’t even understand the world around you. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Western Sichuan obviously shares the same time, space and cultural background with us.

Today, when you should go to farm, just farm. If you need to harvest matsutake, just harvest matsutake, or dig up cordyceps. As for tomorrow, you don’t think too much about it.

Anyway, this is the biggest feedback that entering the mountains gave me. In the past, I seemed to be a person who was more or less out of place in real life. First of all, my freelance career may be different from the life of many office workers (when I get together with other freelance working friends, we never talk about social security); in addition, my peers around me may have already gotten married and had children, which is very important to me. It&#39;s very far away, but if you live in such an impatient society, you will often have a lot of doubts about your position.

Feeling uneasy like that - when a person chooses to write for a living and choose freelancing, she has chosen a narrower and more difficult path.

After forty or fifty times the problem has not been solved. The man said that his children have gone to college and he and his wife have to go to work, but a female neighbor downstairs always says there is something going on at home. To this end, the man laid carpets at his house, gave away the cat, and paid attention to details in his life, but the neighbors still refused to give in. The local police station dispatched police several times, but the neighbors still ignored it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Conflicts often arise between neighbors over trivial matters. For example, some people love to keep pets, but their playful and noisy pets may affect others.

If they believe that the disturbances in the man&#39;s home still have an impact on his life, he can report it to the property management and neighborhood committee and ask them to mediate and resolve the matter. You can also file a lawsuit in court based on this, but you need to provide real evidence of the other party&#39;s infringement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the method the woman adopted was to go to other people&#39;s homes, smash the door and curse.

This not only had a serious impact on the man&#39;s life, she was also suspected of damaging other people&#39;s property, and her behavior also affected other neighbors. Because of this, the unsettled man called the police. However, despite forty or fifty calls to the police, the woman&#39;s behavior was still not effectively stopped, reflecting the mishandling of the incident by the local police. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 9 of the &quot;Public Security Management Punishment Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; stipulates that for minor violations of public security management such as fighting or damaging other people&#39;s property caused by civil disputes, the public security organs may mediate and deal with them. If the parties reach an agreement through mediation by the public security organ, they will not be punished. If no agreement is reached after mediation or the agreement is not fulfilled, the public security organs shall impose penalties on the perpetrators of violations of public security management in accordance with the provisions of this Law, and inform the parties that they may file a civil lawsuit with the People&#39;s Court for civil disputes in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the man originally called the police, the police believed that the woman’s behavior was minor and they could just mediate the matter. However, the neighbor did not accept mediation and continued to harass and even damage other people&#39;s property. Obviously, his behavior does not fall into the category of minor circumstances, and the police should punish him in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In response to this matter, the police should do at least two things in handling this matter. First of all, in the initial mediation process, it is necessary to declare to both parties their respective rights and obligations within the scope of the law. The man has the right not to be harassed. If the female neighbor thinks that the movement in the man&#39;s home interferes with her life, she can Submit this to the court. At the same time, the police should explain the legal basis for the mediation method in this matter, and warn the female neighbor what legal consequences she will face if she cannot accept mediation and continues to smash the door and other behaviors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, when mediation fails again and again and the vicious cycle of the man calling the police and the woman refusing to accept mediation continues to smash the door, the police should resolutely follow the law enforcement authority granted by the &quot;Public Security Administration Punishment Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; and punish It imposes penalties. Calling the police 40 or 50 times in a row failed to stop the woman&#39;s behavior, not to mention making the man involved feel helpless in safeguarding his rights according to law. This was also a huge waste of police resources. At the same time, in the woman&#39;s eyes, the police repeatedly sent out police but never further restricted her behavior, which made it easier for her to be arrogant and &quot;the law can&#39;t do anything to me.&quot; Perhaps it was precisely because of the inaction of the local police time and time again that the woman&#39;s behavior escalated, from cursing to smashing the door. If left unaddressed, the woman&#39;s subsequent behavior may turn into violence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For such incidents, decisive punishment of the woman after police mediation fails is the key to protecting the rights of the victims. If the police fail to hold people accountable in a timely manner and in accordance with the law, it will only encourage illegal behavior and even lead to further deterioration of the situation and cause more social problems. At the same time, this will also mislead others, making them mistakenly believe that there are no legal red lines for such behavior and they can do it arbitrarily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no precedent for the police to deal with such incidents decisively and hold the offenders accountable. According to a report by Time Video in May 2023, in a community in Chaoyang District, Beijing, knocking sounds on the walls of residential buildings were often heard in the middle of the night, causing residents to have trouble sleeping. After investigation, the police identified the resident Liu. According to Liu, he had conflicts with his neighbors because of the poor sound insulation of the house. In order to retaliate, Liu chose to knock on the wall. Because Liu&#39;s behavior disturbed the people and lasted for a long time, he was suspected of provoking quarrels and causing trouble, so he was administratively detained by the public security organs in accordance with the law. If the police do not deal with Liu, I am afraid that residents will still be harassed by him for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regarding incidents of neighborhood nuisance, it is often the case that &quot;the public says the public is right, and the mother-in-law says the mother-in-law is right.&quot; Some parties involved may not have a sufficient understanding of the law. These factors may affect the effectiveness of police mediation. However, this does not mean that the police can relax the enforcement of the law, especially not to treat people differently based on their gender, age, etc. If the above incident involved a man breaking down the door for nearly a year and the woman repeatedly calling the police, will the police tolerate the continuation of such incidents? In fact, the police treat all cases equally and use facts rather than other factors as the basis for law enforcement. This can only reflect judicial fairness, maintain order and fairness within the entire society, and allow offenders to understand the seriousness and inviolability of the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[多名培训机构人员组织研究生考试作弊获刑]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258489]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-14 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On October 11, 2023, the Beijing Haidian District People’s Court prosecuted the defendant Zhang and others for using wireless Transmission method, in the 2021 and 2022 National Master&#39;s Degree Admissions Examination, the first instance verdict was issued on the cheating case of candidates in the examination.

Among them, the defendants Zhang, Xu, Niu, Du, Zhang, Jiang, and Wang were the principal offenders; the defendants Lu and Xu were the accomplices. The court made the above judgment in accordance with the law based on factors such as the defendant&#39;s criminal facts, nature, circumstances, degree of social harm, attitude of confession and repentance, and circumstances of returning stolen goods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the verdict was announced, the defendants did not clearly indicate whether they would appeal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;strong>;The judge’s interpretation: &lt;/strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cheating in exams undermines the exam system and talent selection system, hinders fair competition, and undermines social integrity. Corrupting social morals has serious social harm. In particular, organized examination cheating activities using information technology means are particularly harmful. To this end, the &quot;Criminal Law Amendment (9)&quot; has added provisions such as the crime of cheating in organized examinations, the crime of illegally selling and providing test questions and answers, and the crime of substitute examination, to severely punish the crime of cheating in examinations. Since then, the two top universities have issued the &quot;Interpretation on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Laws in the Handling of Criminal Cases such as Organized Exam Cheating&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Interpretation&quot;), which further provides specific provisions on the conviction, sentencing and application of laws for the crime of examination cheating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The National Postgraduate Admissions Examination involved in this case is a national education examination stipulated by law. It is an important channel for selecting high-level professionals in my country. It has high social attention, great influence, and wide coverage. It is of national importance. take an exam. Article 2, Item (1) of the &quot;Interpretation&quot; directly stipulates that &quot;organizing cheating in the admission examination of ordinary colleges and universities, the admission examination of graduate students, and the recruitment examination of civil servants&quot; is directly defined as &quot;serious circumstances.&quot; The defendants in this case clearly knew that the candidates were participating in the national master&#39;s degree admissions examination, but still participated in it and organized cheating, which is a &quot;serious circumstance.&quot; According to Article 284-1 of the Criminal Law, anyone who organizes cheating and the circumstances are serious shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years but not more than seven years, and shall also be fined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a practical point of view, the crime of cheating in exams has the possibility of re-offending to a certain extent. In order to prevent criminals from &quot;returning to their old careers&quot;, this case is based on the provisions of Article 12 of the &quot;Interpretation&quot; and Zhang is punished in accordance with the law. The nine defendants were declared occupationally prohibited, that is, the nine defendants were prohibited from engaging in occupations related to education, examination, and training within five years from the date of completion of the sentence or the date of parole; at the same time, the defendants who were sentenced to probation were prohibited from engaging in occupations related to education, examination, and training within five years from the date of completion of the sentence or the date of parole; at the same time, the defendants who were sentenced to probation were prohibited from engaging in occupations related to education, examination, and training within five years from the date of completion of the sentence or the date of parole; A prohibition order is issued in accordance with the law, which means that he is prohibited from engaging in activities related to education, examinations, and training during the probation period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Ten years of hard work, but one day of hard work&quot;, examination fairness is a bottom line that cannot be touched in society. Cheating in exams not only undermines exam fairness, but also affects social fairness and seriously harms individual candidates and national interests. &quot;The French Open will be as comprehensive as possible without omissions,&quot; organizers should not take any chances. They also hope that every candidate will strictly abide by the law, take the exam with integrity, refuse to cheat, and use their hard work to obtain satisfactory answers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 08:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[透视银行半年报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258551]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-13 23:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;Commercial banks are not only the transmission system of macro-control policies, but also an excellent window for observing the micro-economy.
