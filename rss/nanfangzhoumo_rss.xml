Searching for the topic of the same name on Weibo, there are 100 million views. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2023, three female bloggers who graduated from Peking University had an online conversation with Chizuru Ueno, and the resulting controversy put the latter&#39;s name at the top of the hot search list. So far, the entries for this conversation have been read 580 million times on the Weibo platform alone, and the topic about Chizuru Ueno has &quot;broken the circle.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This was launched in 2019. Prior to this, very few of Chizuru Ueno&#39;s books were published in mainland China, and most of them were circulated in the sociology circle. In 2019, Chizuru Ueno spoke at the opening ceremony of the University of Tokyo. After the video circulated on the Internet, she also gained great popularity in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/pbMFkPyJfomiNeKNr1xyLeC0o695DUDJQ7hXLarN.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height= &quot;853&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/pbMFkPyJfomiNeKNr1xyLeC0o695DUDJQ7hXLarN.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255381&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chizuru Ueno, born in 1948 in Toyama Prefecture, Japan, is a Japanese sociologist and a pioneer in the fields of Japanese women&#39;s studies and gender studies. She is currently an honorary professor at the University of Tokyo. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In her speech, she focused on the two incidents of Tokyo Medical University entrance examination fraud and Tokyo University sexual assault. , questioned the widespread gender discrimination in Japanese society, and then pointed out through data that the ratio of male and female students at the University of Tokyo is uneven, but the reason is not that female students are not as good as male students, but that &quot;there are various wrong social concepts and unfair admissions in entrance examinations&quot; question&quot;. Ueno warned the freshmen: &quot;What awaits you in the future will be a society where no matter how hard you work, you may not get a fair reward...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chizuru Ueno was introduced to China in 2015 after a speech at the University of Tokyo sparked discussion. Zi&#39;s ​​old work &quot;Misogyny&quot; was quickly reprinted more than twenty times, becoming an important publishing phenomenon in recent years. Since then, other works by Chizuru Ueno have been introduced and published. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/SEwHeYTpgxYro1N6jgVu2AFAc3iQGd594JarO1uR.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2000&quot; height= &quot;1621&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/SEwHeYTpgxYro1N6jgVu2AFAc3iQGd594JarO1uR.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255380&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chizuru Ueno spoke at the opening ceremony of the University of Tokyo in 2019. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the influences of the book &quot;Misogyny&quot; is that &quot;Misogyny&quot; ) such an academic term has been successfully transformed into popular vocabulary. Ueno believes that men often show contempt for women, while women show self-loathing: &quot;If I am 100% not misogynistic, there is no need to be a feminist, because I no longer need to fight. Feminism means constant People who struggle with inner misogyny.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, netizens have often habitually incorporated it into their own life situations to explain the underlying causes of many unpleasant events in life, such as secretly filming women Private photos are uploaded online, gender discrimination in the workplace, product advertising creates body anxiety, celebrities &quot;cheat&quot;...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Publisher Chen Xiying published a collection of conversations between Chizuru Ueno and manga artist Nagako Tamafusa in 2021 &quot;From &quot;Feminism from Scratch&quot; has actual sales of more than 200,000 copies and continues to be printed. In Chen Xiying’s impression, after the word feminism entered China, everyone was still relatively unfamiliar with its connotation and denotation. However, &quot;Feminism from Scratch&quot; is a popular work that integrates daily life into Examples are readily available. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The dialogue in the book basically revolves around women&#39;s &quot;parental shortcomings&quot;, from the length of the skirts of female students&#39; school uniforms to the fact that women are often accused of &quot;revealing clothing&quot; in sexual harassment cases; from the plots of popular TV series to the dilemma of female childbearing; even when talking about the media&#39;s shaping of teenagers, it makes readers realize that the setting of Shizuka in &quot;Doraemon&quot; both attracting men and rebuking men is also a kind of &quot;misogyny&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Chinese publishing industry published seven Ueno books in 2022, including the best-selling book &quot;Starting at the Limit&quot;. Since 2023, Ueno has published more than ten books in China, including serious academic works, as well as relatively light popular readings and dialogue collections. The content covers Chizuru Ueno&#39;s areas of concern in the past forty years. For example, &quot;Women&#39;s Thoughts&quot;, which combs the ideological context of Japanese women&#39;s studies, &quot;Unpaid Housewives&quot;, which cares about the &quot;unpaid&quot; work of housewives, and &quot;A Man&#39;s Old Queen&quot;, which focuses on the issue of elderly care...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Beijing In an Internet celebrity bookstore that mainly sells best-selling books, Southern Weekend reporters saw that the most conspicuous place at the entrance was Chizuru Ueno&#39;s &quot;Women&#39;s Thoughts&quot;, &quot;Feminism from Scratch&quot;, &quot;Misogyny&quot; and &quot;For Survival&quot;. &quot;Thoughts&quot; and other works are placed together with popular and practical books such as &quot;How to Deal with Divorce&quot; and &quot;Common Knowledge of Civil Code in Marriage and Love&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/SrcR5l7rtqhN3frsIcAX3tA9Zg3p67jAex2MFCJF.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height= &quot;683&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/SrcR5l7rtqhN3frsIcAX3tA9Zg3p67jAex2MFCJF.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255379&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chizuru Ueno&#39;s teachings have great influence in Chinese academic circles and the public sphere. Lu Weiwei, a professor at Southeast University who had invited Chizuru Ueno as a visiting scholar, was influenced by her and established a gender research group at the school. The most subscribed female podcast program &quot;Random Fluctuation&quot; on the Xiaoyu App started talking about Chizuru Ueno in the first episode. The picture shows a woman reading a book in the EMI Building in Xujiahui Park, Shanghai, in April 2023. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the focuses of the dispute between the three female bloggers mentioned above and Ueno is that the blogger who is married and has children The Lord asked Ueno, who chose not to get married and have children, &quot;Did you decide not to get married because you were hurt by men?&quot; This type of question is not uncommon in life. It is a misunderstanding that many people have about single women, so it has offended many people on the Internet. Netizens spontaneously posted in defense of Chizuru Ueno, believing that the three bloggers did not understand what feminism was and that such questions were very &quot;misogynistic&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;I like communicating with people from the bottom of my heart&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On social platforms, Chizuru Ueno shows off her iconic red hair. She speaks softly and smiles, but her remarks are sharp. For example, she once strongly criticized the gender injustice in Japanese society, exposing the reality of how women are coerced by &quot;maternal love&quot; and extracting &quot;surplus value&quot;, and said: &quot;Shout when it hurts&quot; Pain, human dignity begins here.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I got to know Chizuru Ueno through Professor Toyo Suga of the University of Tokyo. Suga is a famous Japanese folklorist. He told me that Ueno plays an important role in the whole of Japan. Her influence in the field of humanities and social sciences ranks among the top five, so I must read more of her works.&quot; Lu Weiwei, a professor at the School of Foreign Languages ​​at Southeast University, told Southern Weekend reporters. As one of Ueno&#39;s earliest researchers and translators in China, Lu Weiwei was originally engaged in folklore research. In recent years, she has also taken gender studies as her main research direction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Weiwei has systematically read more than 30 works by Chizuru Ueno. She concluded: &quot;Ueno and his peers established Japanese women&#39;s studies, and things that were not included in academic vision in the past began to be taken seriously. Research, she identified such an academic field.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After retiring from the University of Tokyo, Chizuru Ueno has been very active, and her research has gradually shifted to issues such as elderly care and care. Lu Weiwei recalled: &quot;When I visited Teacher Ueno in Tokyo in July 2023, she also gave me three new books. She is 75 years old and is still actively working and writing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, Lu Weiwei planned The &quot;Todai × Todai&quot; (abbreviations for the University of Tokyo and Southeast University respectively) series of lectures invites Ueno to give lectures at Southeast University in 2019. Classes run from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. every day, and Ueno often takes the initiative to ask for extra classes. From gender studies to aging studies, Chizuru Ueno &quot;teaches everything&quot; in almost all fields of her research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After finishing the course at Southeast University, Lu Weiwei accompanied Ueno to visit several cities such as Xi&#39;an, Harbin, Changchun and Beijing, and gave sharings at different universities. After 18 days of contact, Lu Weiwei got a deeper understanding of Ueno: &quot;She is very curious and very considerate. I praised the umbrella she brought with her for its practicality and beauty, and she gave it to me before leaving.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Media person Qing Qingzi planned and published a collection of dialogues between female scholars, which included her in-depth interview with Chizuru Ueno in 2021. During the exchange, Ueno not only expressed her own opinions, but also listened carefully and listened carefully to the interview. The situation in China is of great interest. Since the video interview was very long, Chizuru Ueno even ordered a cake and said, &quot;If we meet, we can eat it together.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qingqingzi felt that Ueno was a very candid scholar. Although she said that she did not want to expose her personal side, she was still very willing to expose herself when the conversation was enjoyable. After getting to know each other through interviews, Qingqingzi and Ueno maintained email communication like friends. &quot;Ueno really likes to communicate with people from the bottom of his heart.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2023, just a few days after Chizuru Ueno’s discussion about being single and getting married became a hot search topic on Weibo, the Japanese media “Shukan Bunshun” published an article titled “Chizuru Ueno, the founder of single education, naturalizes” The article &quot;Marriage&quot; broke the news that Chizuru Ueno and the late historian Shirkawa Daiyoshi had registered their marriage. Some people began to question Chizuru Ueno, believing that her words and deeds were inconsistent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than 20 days later, Chizuru Ueno responded by publishing the article &quot;The 15-Hour Bride&quot; in the &quot;Woman Public Theory&quot; magazine to clarify the cause and effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Seikawa is 23 years older than Ueno. His wife has passed away and his son has lost contact with her. Ueno has taken on the responsibility of taking care of Seikawa and helping him manage his assets. This relationship is exactly what Ueno wants to study about pension issues in his later years. Through practice, she hopes to establish an effective mutual-help relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, because Ueno is legally not related to Shikawa, he cannot sign the consent form for the operation at the critical moment, nor can he help him handle complex property matters. He is subject to Japanese family law. In order to facilitate the process, Various problems before and after Sechuan&#39;s death forced her to apply for marriage. Their marriage only lasted 15 hours before Sechuan passed away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I didn&#39;t intend to hide this, but there was no reason to disclose it in the first place. Everyone who knows already knows, and my friends are not the kind to sell their friends&#39; privacy. Villain. But if there are outsiders spreading some false rumors, it would be better for me, the person involved, to tell these stories to everyone personally, so I wrote this article.&quot; At the end of the article, Chizuru Ueno wrote. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2023, Chizuru Ueno&#39;s new book &quot;Marry Me&quot; was published. In this book, she analyzed in detail her views on issues such as marriage and childbirth. On the cover of this new book, there is this sentence written: &quot;Towards a society where you can freely choose whether to marry, get married, or have children!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;It is no longer impossible to live without marriage&lt;/h4>; &lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Can you briefly introduce the background of your writing &quot;Marry Me&quot; and what kind of opportunity it was for you to write it? Have you decided to talk specifically about the issue of being single and not getting married? I&#39;m also curious, has there been any change in Japan&#39;s unmarried group since this book was first published? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chizuru Ueno:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Among the female population of the same age, I belong to the less than 5% of unmarried people. Japan&#39;s lifelong non-marriage rate has continued to rise. By 2020, the non-marriage rate for men was 28.25% and for women was 18.81%. The government calls this statistic &quot;never-married.&quot; But I call it &quot;not married&quot;. Because &quot;unmarried&quot; means &quot;not yet married&quot;, implying that &quot;sooner or later you will get married.&quot; However, since there are so many people who are not married, it means that &quot;not getting married&quot; is not a stage of life, but a way of life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether you get married or not, you have children, you don’t have children, you get divorced... There are more choices, which is a good thing. Rather than saying that this book had an impact on society, it is better to say that changes in society created needs that prompted the publication of this book. Because before this, those unmarried men and women have always suffered discrimination and were always asked &quot;Why don&#39;t you get married?&quot; This book aims to encourage those unmarried people to live an upright life, so I chose &quot;Not Married, Again&quot; how? &quot;(Editor&#39;s note: the original title of the Japanese version of &quot;Marry Me&quot;) is the title of the book. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The marriage rate in Japan is also getting lower and lower. Do you think that behind the scenes? What is the reason? Are there different reasons why men choose not to marry and why women choose not to marry? If this continues, people&#39;s understanding of marriage will inevitably change. Do you think we have reached such a point now? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chizuru Ueno:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Not only because marriage is no longer an attractive option, but also because I want to start a family. The cost is simply too high. That&#39;s why the number of men and women who don&#39;t get married will increase. Men and women show an asymmetry in their reasons for choosing not to marry. Men cannot get married, and women do not want to get married. In the past, marriage was a necessity of life for both men and women, and it was impossible to live without marriage. But in today&#39;s Japan, marriage is a &quot;life surplus asset&quot; that makes life richer. People&#39;s expectations for their spouses have also increased a lot compared to the past. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You once said, &quot;Compared to not getting married, I I want to know more about the reasons for getting married.&quot; How do you understand women who enter into marriage? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chizuru Ueno:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Having sex because we are in love, having children and becoming parents out of our own will, this experience can make us Life is more abundant. However, many men and women get married and have children when they reach a certain age just for reasons such as obeying traditional customs, &quot;because of parents&#39; requirements&quot;, &quot;because of society&#39;s requirements&quot;. If they have never seen their parents have a happy married life, how can their children be motivated to get married? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If women had more choices, they would not choose to marry against their will. And if their married life is very unhappy, they can also escape from it. For this reason, men must make changes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You were also exposed to marriage rumors a while ago, until you later made a statement State the cause and effect of the matter. What impact did this have on you? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chizuru Ueno:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I am still opposed to the (Japanese) marriage system. Unfortunately, the barriers to Japanese familialism laws are too thick, so I had no choice but to take advantage of the system to do something. To this day, I still deeply regret it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Marriage will not greatly change a woman’s life, but childbirth will&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When discussing marriage issues, we must also face the issue of fertility. Marriage and childbirth are no longer a must-choose issue in life, but it does not mean that women will no longer be anxious about it. What do you think of this issue? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chizuru Ueno:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There is no inevitable relationship between marriage and childbirth. However, many people get married for the purpose of having children. Marriage itself will not bring about any major changes in women&#39;s lives, but childbirth will greatly change women&#39;s lives. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Marriage by Me&quot; also discusses unmarried childbirth , compared with the fertility and parenting issues within marriage, what do you think is special about fertility issues outside marriage? In China, some cities have begun to provide policy support for unmarried mothers such as settlement. There is a sentence on the cover of the Chinese version of &quot;Marry Me&quot;: &quot;Towards a society where you can freely choose not to marry, to get married, or to have children!&quot; Is this kind of social form possible? What efforts do people need to make? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chizuru Ueno:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Many unmarried single mothers mostly do not actively choose not to get married, but after learning the news of pregnancy, they make themselves The pregnant man ran away. However, they did not choose to induce labor, but chose to give birth to the child. The background condition is that he has the support of his parents in his hometown. Of course, there are also some women who actively choose to become unmarried single mothers because they have certain financial strength. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The demand of the Japanese women&#39;s movement is to &quot;establish a society where women can give birth and raise children alone.&quot; However, society still does not provide enough support to single mothers, and even assigns &quot;three, six, or nine&quot; categories to widowed single mothers, divorced single mothers, and unmarried single mothers. Only recently has discrimination between these categories been gradually erased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people believe that policies to support single mothers will encourage men&#39;s &quot;irresponsible&quot; mentality. There is indeed a problem at this level, but the government allocating a certain amount of tax money to support single mothers means that our society has a collective responsibility in raising the next generation, and this collective also includes men who pay more taxes. Some Nordic countries will impose mandatory alimony on the man who got the woman pregnant. If the man is unwilling to pay, the state will advance the payment for him and then hold the man accountable. Japan does not have such a system, which is really a headache. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For many women who are married and have children, they have to work, You have to take on housework; but if you don’t work, you can’t gain so-called “independence.” This seems to be a dilemma of modernity? Do you think there is a solution to this dilemma? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chizuru Ueno:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There are four ways to share women’s family responsibilities: First, the first point is that men should also assume the same family responsibilities; the second point is that the state should provide public childcare services (such as providing nurseries, etc.) to reduce the childcare burden of citizens; the third point is to use the income earned by both parties from working together to hire someone to do housework; the fourth point is, Relying on the power of (maternal) grandmothers, but this approach simply shifts the responsibility from one generation of women to another. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Japan, none of the above four methods exist. This is exactly why Japanese women are in so much pain. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Human beings are fragile&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Your research not only focuses on history, but also radiates to the present, including but not limited to issues such as sexual violence in war, individual sex and love, the situation of housewives, and care for the elderly. I am very curious about the source of your awareness of these issues. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chizuru Ueno:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;All my research is based on my own experience. When I was young, I was interested in topics such as &quot;sex&quot; and &quot;love&quot;. As I got older, I began to care about topics such as &quot;old age&quot; and &quot;caregiving&quot;. I also met and talked to many women who were leading different lives. I have experience living in Germany. Both Japan and Germany were defeated countries in World War II, but what kind of relationships did they establish with their surrounding countries after the war? I was struck by the obvious difference between Germany and Japan on this point. To this day, Japan still has not been able to establish full trusting relations with neighboring countries such as South Korea and China, which it has invaded before. For this reason, I feel very sorry. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Whether it is women or the elderly, the support for the weak Attention is a focus of your research. What do you think you have always adhered to in your entire research context? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chizuru Ueno:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I have dealt with many people, and I have deeply understood the truth that human beings are fragile. . Since it is fragile, it should be treated with caution. By thinking this way, we can be tolerant of others and more tolerant of ourselves. This is also the effect of increasing age. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Japan is an aging society, and now in China This question is becoming increasingly important.

The long-term care insurance introduced by Japan more than 20 years ago has played a great role in allowing citizens to live with peace of mind in old age. Hopefully we can learn something from it too. For me, growing older is a new experience. If what needs to be protected disappears and there is nothing left to lose, the person will become increasingly free. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You emphasized in the documentary &quot;The Last Lesson&quot; &quot;Feminism is about enabling the weak to survive as the weak&quot;, which reverses many people&#39;s misunderstanding that feminism only focuses on &quot;women&quot; issues. Why does feminism naturally care for and affirm the weak? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chizuru Ueno:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;No matter how powerful a person is, he is also weak at birth. And one day he will definitely become a weakling. Men are no exception. Women often accompany children, the elderly, the disabled and the sick, so they understand the weak and can imagine their plight. And men just forget these, or just pretend to forget. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You emphasize that this is no longer a matter of hard work. A rewarding society, while emphasizing care for the &quot;weak&quot;, once said, &quot;Please don&#39;t show off your strength, but admit your weaknesses and support each other to live.&quot; Can it be understood that people need to build some kind of community and help each other make society a better place? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chizuru Ueno:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;People cannot live alone in the world, and they cannot die alone when they die.

After so many years of development, what achievements has Japan’s “women’s studies” research made today? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chizuru Ueno:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Forty years ago, there was no such subject for women in Japanese universities. So we, the pioneer generation, learned women’s studies on our own. At that time, some people still ridiculed us, &quot;Is women&#39;s studies a science?&quot; Later, women&#39;s studies entered all professional fields and was established as a discipline, and relevant courses were also offered in universities. It is a pity that Japanese universities have neither “women’s studies departments” nor “women’s studies directions.” Rather than enclosing territory, it is more important to extend gender perspectives across all fields. As a result, we have accumulated theoretical and empirical research on women’s studies and gender studies in many fields, and have trained many researchers. The website &quot;WAN&quot; (https://wan.or.jp/general/corner/papers) we created has collected a list of more than 1,500 dissertations on women&#39;s studies or gender studies over more than 40 years. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;There is a concept that when it comes to feminism, It seems that it is inevitable to discuss love, marriage and family, and some of your research is also related to this, but is this what feminism is all about? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chizuru Ueno:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;No, it’s because in human society, no group is independent of gender. So when there are women, we use women’s experience as the research object. When there are no women, we study why there are no women. When focusing on men, we study how this characteristic of men is shaped. Therefore, there is no field that gender studies cannot deal with. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Criticism&quot; and &quot;blame&quot; are different&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Marry Me&quot; is a collection of dialogues, and in addition to your serious academic works, you also often have dialogues with people from all walks of life.

By communicating with people from different generations and backgrounds, what do you want to convey to your readers? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chizuru Ueno:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I really like talking to people with different life backgrounds. This can stimulate my curiosity, and during the conversation Sometimes the other person will bring out another side of me that I have never noticed. &quot;Others&quot; are an important catalyst for me to know who I really am.

Although they asked me to submit the original manuscript of my speech, they did not interfere with the speech at all. content of the manuscript. The content of my speech was all planned out in advance. Because the podium at the entrance ceremony also has a &quot;speaker&quot; effect, I think this is a good opportunity to convey what I have been thinking to a larger audience. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After your speech at the University of Tokyo, you became an internet celebrity. &quot;Celebrity&quot; has attracted the attention of intellectual circles in China. Especially in recent years, a large number of your books have been published in China. What do you think of this phenomenon? Why do you think Chinese readers, especially female readers, admire you so much? Do you think it is a good thing that intellectuals have become &quot;popular&quot; due to the Internet? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chizuru Ueno:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The goal of feminism is to verbalize and theorize women’s experience. I think it is because the younger generation of women in China have found the language to express their own experiences in my works. One thing that Japan and China have in common is that many girls are carefully raised in a generation with a low birthrate. Under China&#39;s reform and opening up policy, and with the continuous development of marketization, the life experiences of women in the two countries may be getting closer and closer. Moreover, Chinese readers may feel closer to Asian feminism than to feminism in Europe and America. However, I am very much looking forward to seeing the emergence of Chinese-specific feminology and the birth of Chinese feminism. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don’t think there is anything to worry about when intellectuals become popular people.

Every country has its own unique circumstances. It needs to be studied separately for different societies. Although I have come to Chinese universities to give lectures, I have only met (mostly) elite women from cities who attend mindful universities, and I know nothing about women living in the vast rural areas, so I cannot answer this question. I think this issue needs to be studied by Chinese researchers. My impression of the elite women living in the city is that they are girls who were carefully raised as only children. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You have encountered many doubts along the way.

Women&#39;s studies and gender studies are not afraid of controversy, and to this day and ever since, it has been a field of scholarship that has been hotly debated and thus advanced. &quot;Criticism&quot; is different from &quot;blame&quot;.

The video of Changchun underground idol Blossom&#39;s first performance of &quot;Geqie&quot; has been viewed more than 5 million times on station B. In May of this year, the popularity of the video made the term &quot;We also have underground idols in the Northeast&quot; a hot search topic. This was also the first time that the niche culture of &quot;underground idols&quot; appeared on mainstream domestic social platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is an &quot;underground idol&quot;? It originated in Japan and specifically refers to artists or groups that focus on offline performances, usually do not appear on mainstream media such as TV, and have not debuted through a brokerage company. In 2023, with the full resumption of offline performances, &quot;ground puppets&quot; (short for &quot;underground idols&quot;) have gradually entered the lives of young people. More and more fans who love idol groups and singing and dancing performances choose to go to large and small shopping malls, theaters, and live houses on weekends to cheer for their favorite idols. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the &quot;underground idol&quot; industry is quietly emerging and expanding rapidly in China. According to statistics from the @Underground Idol related bulletin board, there are currently about 131 underground idol groups active in China, distributed in 22 provinces, municipalities and special administrative regions across the country, especially in first-tier cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou (12 in Beijing , Shanghai 21). More than a year ago, in September 2022, the total number of domestic &quot;geido&quot; groups was only about 53. In other words, about half of the &quot;Geo Puppet&quot; groups currently active were formed this year. Because of this, 2023 is also called the &quot;First Year of Ge Puppet&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What unique charm does “underground idol” have? Why did it attract so many fans and rise so quickly this year? How is it different from the traditional idol industry? As an imported culture, what challenges does its localization development in China face? Focusing on these questions, our reporters recently visited relevant fans, operators and new underground idols to help everyone learn more about the slightly new concept of &quot;ground puppets&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/046339fad3ec9f1b89ea0efa4819e3c0.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;373&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/046339fad3ec9f1b89ea0efa4819e3c0.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255294&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;What is an “underground idol”? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;All open-mic singing and dancing on the stage, immersive interaction off the stage, and &quot;special talks&quot; at close range&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This year One weekend in the spring, Xiao Zhang (pseudonym) went to watch an &quot;underground idol&quot; offline performance for the first time, and from then on, he &quot;entered the trap&quot; and started chasing &quot;underground idols&quot;. Before that, she had only heard of the term &quot;underground idol&quot;. By chance, she saw the activity information of &quot;Geo Puppet&quot; on social platforms and learned that its performance included Japanese songs that she usually liked to listen to. She became interested and went to the venue with her friends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Very energetic, full of real singing, and highly infectious.” This is Xiaozhang’s biggest feeling after watching the performance of “Earth Puppet” for the first time. &quot;I feel very happy!&quot; Xiao Zhang felt the sincerity and hard work of the performers, and at the same time, she became a fan of one of the young idols. &quot;I feel that her style is more special and eye-catching.&quot; She recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Xiao Zhang was deeply impressed by the way the audience supported him that day: &quot;A group of people would pick up an audience member and rush from the back of the auditorium to the front of the stage to interact with the little idol.&quot; The enthusiastic support scene shocked him deeply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The high degree of interaction and various interesting ways of supporting have also become a unique charm of underground idol performances, making the audience and fans feel that they are an indispensable part of the performance. Another &quot;Diido&quot; fan Xiaojie (pseudonym) told reporters: &quot;Underground idols make people feel more involved, or closer (to the idols) and more interactive (with the idols). They There are many people dancing on the stage and off the stage, and the atmosphere is even better.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10 /25/6c019e1a06776ae7a95f3dfd96a5e51a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;856&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /10/25/6c019e1a06776ae7a95f3dfd96a5e51a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255295&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, there are also noisy &quot;social cows&quot; groups among the audience of &quot;Land Puppet&quot;. Xiao Zhang mentioned that the organizer of that performance set up zones for the audience, including &quot;quiet viewing area&quot;, &quot;free area&quot; and &quot;female area&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the &quot;Free Zone&quot;, fans will support and interact enthusiastically, such as the &quot;take-off&quot; mentioned just now - lifting the audience up and &quot;flying&quot; to the stage; &quot;Quiet Viewing Zone&quot; &quot; is prepared for the introverted &quot;i people&quot; group. They don&#39;t need to do anything, and just want to enjoy the idol&#39;s performance silently in the audience. Xiao Zhang chose to stay in the &quot;female area&quot;, and this part of the audience will wave light sticks in honor of their idols. Calling, but not nearly as intense as &quot;Free Zone&quot;. The setting of partitioned viewing ensures that audiences with different personalities can be immersed in the performance and avoid mutual interference and collision. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the performance, Xiao Zhang had his first photo with his idol at the following &quot;special event&quot;. &quot;Special Bonus&quot; is an event held together with the performances of underground idol groups.

The ticket prices for the performances range from tens to 200 yuan depending on the size of the event (occasionally there are free performances) , the box office revenue belongs to the show organizer. The income of idol group companies and members mainly depends on fans&#39; consumption at &quot;special events&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She told reporters that fans of &quot;Geo Doll&quot; call taking Polaroid photos with their idols &quot;Paikiri&quot; (translated from the Japanese transliteration of Polaroid), and idols will also &quot;cut&quot; Leave your own signature graffiti on (photo). The average price of a &quot;che&quot; with an idol&#39;s signature graffiti is about 80-100 yuan; the average price of a &quot;che&quot; without a signature graffiti is about 40-60 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Purchasing a &quot;special coupon&quot; will not only give you the opportunity to take a Polaroid photo with your idol, but also means that fans will have the opportunity to chat with their idol up close for about a minute, so the special coupon will be Also known as &quot;Qiaochanghui&quot; (shooting + chatting). Xiaozhang told reporters that while fans are communicating with their idols, there will be staff standing by to count the time. Many fans will buy a dozen or even dozens of special coupons at one time in order to gain more time with their idols. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Why do we need “underground idols”? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Emotional value, high cost performance, two-way travel&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When talking about the reasons for &quot;falling into the trap&quot;, Xiaozhang emphasized that &quot;all The importance of &quot;real singing&quot; and &quot;stage appeal&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before, she also went to watch offline performances of some &quot;above ground&quot; idol groups (contrary to &quot;underground&quot;, idol artists who will be exposed in mainstream media). In order to ensure the quality of the performance, the audience rarely gets to see the full stage of singing and dancing. &quot;In comparison, &#39;Dippo&#39; has better stage appeal, and singing on the mic is really important.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/23/10/25/db78036bddb3d20628f09a8334734652.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;393&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com /cms/medias/image/23/10/25/db78036bddb3d20628f09a8334734652.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255296&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through the stage of underground idols, Xiao Zhang can feel that these young idols are coming from their own hearts. I love singing and dancing at heart. &quot;Seeing this person working hard for his beloved dream and shining on the stage makes me feel inspired.&quot; Perhaps many people have had an &quot;idol dream&quot; in their hearts, but they were unable to realize it due to various reasons. &quot;Seeing them When you work hard, you feel good, and you feel that you have to work harder (to live a good life).&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the singing and dancing levels of underground idols vary, some members have made great progress. There is no space, but in the eyes of fans such as Xiao Zhang, daring to open the microphone and sing for real is an attitude worthy of recognition, &quot;At least they work hard to show themselves on stage. And I think she (Xiao Zhang&#39;s idol) has the talent to sing.&quot; Progress can be clearly felt.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an interview with reporters, fan Xiaojie attributed the essence of chasing stars to &quot;obtaining emotional value&quot;: &quot;The purpose of chasing idols is not to say that our aesthetics have How high it is depends on how strong their singing and dancing skills are. They are just chasing an emotional value. Watching idols will make our lives more interesting and make every weekend more fulfilling. When we are so tired from work, we have to think of something to support us. Go down.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/e0574545470994e52f13ffa9b3659f74.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity : 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;434&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/e0574545470994e52f13ffa9b3659f74.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255297&quot; >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the conversation with reporters, the two fans unanimously mentioned that compared to those mainstream idols who are active in the public eye, chasing &quot;land idols&quot; has a higher cost-effectiveness and allows them to be in the public eye. Get more emotional value with the same effort. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, the &quot;above ground&quot; idol group SNH48 also uses &quot;face-to-face idols&quot; as its operating model, with theater performances and &quot;handshake meetings&quot; similar to &quot;special parties&quot;, but its prices are much higher than those of the &quot;ground&quot; idol group. I&quot;. Ticket prices, originally priced at only 98 yuan, have been skyrocketed, and tickets for popular events cost tens to hundreds of yuan. If you want a VIP position such as the first row, you need to bid, which can easily cost thousands of yuan. A handshake ticket (which allows you to shake hands and chat with a young idol for 10 seconds) costs 20 to 30 yuan, an autograph ticket costs 100 to 200 yuan, and a photo ticket costs 600 to 700 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, when &quot;Geo Puppet&quot; provides services such as photos, autographs, and face-to-face communication, fans can gain a richer emotional experience at less cost. After all, the number of fans that &quot;ground puppets&quot; have is far less than that of celebrity artists. Most of them have clear impressions of their followers. They will remember almost every fan&#39;s appearance, preferences, topics of communication and other details. There are also many more. Respond with energy and emotion to achieve a true &quot;two-way rush&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/e2ed8f51cdc6b930124e9867fa606f9c.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;407&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/e2ed8f51cdc6b930124e9867fa606f9c.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255298&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;Xiaojie shared with reporters that she once received a fan benefit when she purchased a certain number of &quot;special coupons&quot; - asking her idol to write a letter to her. &quot;Because I wrote her a letter before, she wrote a reply.&quot; In that letter to her idol, Xiaojie mentioned how happy she felt every time she went to watch her idol&#39;s performance, and these contents It was also mentioned one by one by the idol in the reply letter, &quot;She told me (written in the reply letter) that actually when she received my letter, she was very unsure and confused. She said it was mine. That letter gave her a lot of strength.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the idol also expressed her persistence and love for this career and her years of pursuing her dream. &quot;She said that every time she stood on the stage Every time she went on stage, she would feel a sense of tingling excitement. She had very few fans before, and she thought about whether to continue, and was confused for a long time... But in the end she figured it out, as long as she enjoys standing on the stage It’ll be great when you get on.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiaojie mentioned that compared to mainstream celebrity artists, the feeling of “Chasing the Earth Puppet” is more pure. Since underground idols are not exposed in the media, the state of being close to amateurs will be more real and relaxed. Without the constraints of the company, the packaging of personality, and the scrutiny of the public, fans can feel &quot;the intimacy like friends&quot; when communicating with idols. . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Who is becoming an “underground idol”? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Liu Xiajun: &quot;After becoming an underground idol, I clearly know who is supporting me.&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Have participated in &quot;Creation&quot; Liu Hajun, the singing and dancing idol of &quot;Camp 2019&quot;, experienced &quot;from the ground to the underground&quot; this year and became the captain of the men&#39;s &quot;ground puppet&quot; group &quot;Brick Paw Team&quot;, thus having the opportunity to go on stage again and have close contact with fans.

The group has a total of six members, including students and 9-to-5 workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Xiajun revealed that the team&#39;s rehearsal time is usually set after nine o&#39;clock in the evening, and everyone works hard to get along with each other. &quot;As for the stage, I still demand myself according to the requirements of the past (during the Creation Camp), even better than before.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 27, the &quot;Brick-Moving Wangwang Team&quot; successfully ushered in First performance. Liu Xiajun still clearly remembers that many fans who have liked him since the broadcast of &quot;Produce Camp 2019&quot; came to the scene to support him, which moved him very much: &quot;Many fans from 4 years ago still support me now. , has been with me for a long time. At that moment, I really felt that I did the right thing and did not let them down.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a former &quot;above ground idol&quot;, in the process of turning to the &quot;underground&quot; , Liu Xiajun is also slowly adapting to his new identity and constantly learning new skills, such as how to communicate closely with fans at the &quot;special party&quot; after the performance, what topics should he talk to everyone; when there are fans How to communicate with them when talking about life troubles; what patterns should be drawn when signing and graffiti on &quot;Che&quot; (photos)...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/23/10/25/120132533396b7f88e39091203bc3585.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;679&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/120132533396b7f88e39091203bc3585.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255301&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, in Liu Xiajun&#39;s view, being a &quot;land puppet&quot; is more unique The advantage is that he can receive more intuitive, specific and immediate feedback from fans. The relationship between idols and fans has changed from one-way output to two-way interaction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;When I participated in &quot;Creation Camp&quot;, I knew that some people liked me, but &#39;fans&#39; were more like a concept with a certain sense of distance. But when I was an underground idol, I was able to I know very clearly who is supporting me, her nickname, image, and even her emotions and her story. I can know why everyone likes me and what is not good about my performance today.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When asked &quot;What kind of person is suitable to be a puppet&quot;, Liu Xiajun also mentioned the word &quot;emotional value&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I think to be an underground idol, you must be a very sincere person. You must love this job, respect this job, and sincerely face all the people who support you. Your singing and dancing skills can continue Growth, but attitude is the most important.&quot; He talked about his understanding of the profession of &quot;idol&quot;, &quot;The duty of an idol is to make fans happy, to bring good energy to fans, (to provide them with) &#39;emotional value&#39; &#39;For an idol, it is greater than anything else.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;What is the future of &quot;underground idols&quot;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Conversation with performance operators &amp;amp; group producers&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In addition to artists with stage experience like Liu Xiajun, there are also a large number of people who love singing Amateur stage dancers have joined the &quot;ground puppet&quot; industry in recent years. However, it should be noted that as a new industry, underground idols have not yet reached a mature stage. Many relevant reports have mentioned that the income of most underground idols is not considerable, and most of them work part-time to &quot;generate money for love.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Xiajun revealed to reporters that he never regarded &quot;ground puppets&quot; as a way to make money from the beginning. &quot;In fact (now) most of his income still comes from being a dance teacher and performing in a dance troupe. Underground The job of an idol is more out of love.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Xiajun, who has a certain fan base, cannot support himself just by being a &quot;land puppet&quot;, let alone those who need to accumulate popularity from scratch. Amateur idol. Although more and more people are joining in, with the current audience size, &quot;ground puppet&quot; has not yet developed into a stable career that can make a living. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiao Liu (pseudonym), who started hosting &quot;ground puppet&quot; performances in 2021, told reporters that he has always treated the &quot;ground puppet&quot; group as real commercial entertainers. If they are invited to participate in the platter, If they perform, their travel expenses will be reimbursed to ensure that the groups that come to perform do not lose money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;We will share some of the commission for the &#39;special event&#39;, but we will ensure that you will have a certain amount of income as long as you come.&quot; Xiao Liu revealed that this method of operation is different from most situations in the industry. &quot;Other performances The organizers basically ask you to bear the performance costs yourself, but basically most people (the income from the special events) cannot afford their own travel expenses, so it is easy to lose money as a group, and it will also cause a very high income (for the puppets). Unstable.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/a17d7695c9f01ab1fb67614e8a3d3049.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;636&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/a17d7695c9f01ab1fb67614e8a3d3049.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255302 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is more worrying than the meager income is the chaos in the industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Starting this year, in addition to hosting platter performances, Xiao Liu has also begun to create and operate a new &quot;ground puppet&quot; group. Talking about his original intention to join a group, Xiao Liu mentioned that he has seen some bad phenomena in the industry in recent years and hopes to do his best to improve the current situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We feel that there are many children, who may be minors or just adults, as well as freshly graduated college students. They are completely unaware of the sinister side of society and will be deceived and work for others for nothing. The share received is very small.&quot; Xiao Liu also revealed that some companies will even pocket the travel subsidies provided by the event organizers, &quot;asking the organizers to reimburse hotel expenses and actually allowing members to stay in youth hostels.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiao Liu It is hoped that through the production team, we can find &quot;Earth Puppet&quot; members with real potential, and at the same time, we can provide them with relatively better treatment and protect their living foundation. &quot;We will reimburse them for all travel expenses for performances, including daily rehearsals, costumes, songwriting, etc., all of which will be borne by us, and the income share we give them will be higher than the general level in the industry.&quot; Xiao Liu told reporters, At present, in addition to &quot;land puppets&quot;, he is also engaged in other businesses, and the related income also supports him to continue to be an underground idol. &quot;Because we are not making money from this (land puppets), so as long as we don&#39;t pay particularly hard, , we can do it.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an imported culture, underground idols still face the test of localization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fan Zhang mentioned in an interview that the current performances of many &quot;ground puppet&quot; groups are still mainly covering songs of Japanese underground idols. Even if they are original songs, many of them are in Japanese. . &quot;There are definitely copyright issues (for performance covers), but it may be because it is difficult for (foreign copyright holders) to come to China to trace back.&quot; Xiao Liu told reporters that his group is also preparing original songs with Chinese lyrics to enrich the performance. content. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the localization of performance content, the &quot;ground puppet&quot; industry still faces many problems in its rapid development and expansion, such as the diversification of audiences. Xiao Liu mentioned in an interview that a large part of the current domestic audience for &quot;geol&quot; people have &quot;climbed over the wall&quot; from other cultural circles. Their aesthetic orientations and star-chasing habits are diverse. What should we do? Compatible coexistence? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For another example, he knows that this industry needs relevant treaties to regulate it, but he also bluntly said: &quot;It itself is an &#39;underground culture&#39;. If there is too much intervention in the &#39;above ground&#39; way, there may be no It’s the kind of freedom that everyone loves.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While many fans like Xiaozhang &quot;hope that more people can understand and accept this niche culture&quot;, many people also raise questions and concerns about promoting &quot;Earth Puppets&quot; out of the circle. , to some extent it seems to be contrary to the essence of &quot;Earth Puppet&quot;...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although everything is still being explored, we need to gradually improve it to achieve a certain balance. But what is worthy of recognition is that the &quot;underground idols&quot; that are growing freely and expanding rapidly have provided a new opportunity and possibility for the idol industry that has been in the cold at the moment when domestic entertainment talent shows are suspended. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It allows us to see that &quot;star chasing&quot; is not only fans&#39; admiration and following of idols, and the construction and imagination of intimate relationships, but also two-way, equal, and co-creation. Clear business rules and a close interactive experience allow idols who enjoy the stage to see clearly the faces of everyone in the audience, allowing fans to receive real and concrete responses to their efforts. In the world of &quot;underground idols&quot;, &quot;going both ways&quot; is easier to cash in on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 25 Oct 2023 21:55:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[邱礼涛：香港电影打工人]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259250]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-25 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;After the movie &quot;Moscow Operation&quot; entered preparations, at the internal meeting of Chinese Film Industry, whenever the director&#39;s Ideal candidate, many people will ask, is it possible to find Director Qiu? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The film is based on the &quot;China-Russia Train Robbery&quot; in 1993. It combines real historical cases in China with commercial elements. Successful precedents include &quot;Operation Mekong&quot; and &quot;Operation Red Sea&quot;. &quot;Operation Moscow&quot; has a strong pursuit of film industrialization. It took more than half a year to restore many real scenes in Russia at that time, and presented the underground cistern, the Sino-Russian train rail-changing station, and the rocket base 1:1. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Producer Gui Youming said that the production team had just watched &quot;Bomb Disposal Expert 2&quot; not long ago and liked the film very much. &quot;It seemed to be somewhat similar to what we wanted.&quot; If it were placed in the 1980s, this candidate might be John Woo or McDonald&#39;s. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, (co-producer) Andy Lau helped hand over the script, and Qiu Litao made a decision quickly after reading it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since entering the Hong Kong film industry in the 1980s, Qiu Litao has served as a photographer, editor, screenwriter, and director on the set, covering almost all types of work. He is extremely prolific and has directed nearly 80 films, spanning action films, police films, crime films, horror films, comedies, romance films, etc. At the same time, as a photographer, he has often become a &quot;firefighter&quot; for other Hong Kong directors. Team members&quot; and have an excellent reputation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2023, including &quot;Operation Moscow&quot; released on National Day, four films including &quot;Anti-Drug 3&quot;, &quot;Jedi&#39;s Pursuit&quot; and &quot;Assassination Storm&quot; filmed by Qiu Litao were released in mainland China, and several films have been filmed. Completed and waiting for release. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hong Kong films are lonely, but Qiu Litao has many film appointments. In 2019, &quot;Anti-Drug 2&quot; and &quot;Bomb Disposer 2&quot; in 2020 both achieved box office of more than 1.3 billion yuan, which was a rare box office performance for Hong Kong films in recent years. &quot;Bomb Disposaler 2&quot; was even more popular that year. ’s market rescue work, ranked among the ten Chinese-language films with the highest ratings on Douban in 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Litao was once regarded as the mainstay of the revival of Hong Kong films - he experienced rigorous training and shaping in the golden age of the Hong Kong film industry system, and always insisted on a high frequency of filming during the trough period of the industry. To this day, it can still bring &quot;the most authentic Hong Kong films&quot; to audiences. However, in the summer of 2023, the box office results of Qiu Litao&#39;s three films were not satisfactory. &quot;Jedi&quot; cost 100 million yuan, but the box office was less than 30 million yuan, which attracted criticism from him as a &quot;bad film&quot; and &quot;a professional director&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meeting with Director Qiu Litao will be at the end of September 2023. In a small suite at a hotel near Dawang Road in Beijing, Qiu Litao had long hair and wore a black jacket. Unlike usual, he didn&#39;t wear a T-shirt with rock elements. The video shooting equipment was set up for a long time. Qiu Litao, who is a videographer, did not come forward to help, but rested against the window. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the interview, he had a loud voice, a smile and answered all questions. When he heard a Mandarin word he didn&#39;t understand, he pointed to the notebook in front of the reporter and said, &quot;Write it for me.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/Fi95Cw8gIzFhHf8WqseP9Fp9EN2whwQpmotkgBQa.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/Fi95Cw8gIzFhHf8WqseP9Fp9EN2whwQpmotkgBQa.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255316&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;At the end of September 2023, Qiu Litao was interviewed by a Southern Weekend reporter in Beijing. He said that he &quot;wanted to film Oppenheimer&#39;s story ten years ago&quot; and also wanted to film Shaw. The story of Takovich and Aung San Suu Kyi. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by Pumpkin Vision)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Litao told Southern Weekend reporters that &quot;Anti-Drug 2&quot; and &quot;Bomb Disposal Expert 2&quot; After the success of &quot;The Movie&quot;, the number of people looking for him to make films was actually as high as before. Even when Hong Kong&#39;s film scene was in dire straits, people were still looking for him to film. &quot;When it comes to quantity, it used to be a little less, but it&#39;s still quite a lot. Not a lot means I can&#39;t finish them all, and I still have some to recommend. But in the past few years, the ones I&#39;ve been approached to shoot are all big productions, and here&#39;s the difference.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Superman&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Gui Youming and Qiu Litao first met in Xishuangbanna. At that time, he and screenwriter Chen Daming went there with the script of &quot;Operation Moscow&quot;. Qiu Litao, who was still filming another film, had already done his homework in advance. He took a notebook and talked about his ideas one by one. The main opinion was to reduce the script . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Sino-Russian train robbery in 1993 caused a sensation. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the K3 train, which was responsible for economic exchanges between China and Russia, carried countless &quot;transnational villains&quot;, and robberies and rapes occurred frequently. Screenwriter Chen Daming has personally experienced that period of history, and remembers that all the talk in the phone booth at that time was about reselling color TVs and jeeps. In 1992, he spent six months in Moscow and saw an old man wearing a Soviet Patriotic War medal begging. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Litao hopes to restore the people and style of that era. The policemen and robbers in the movie are all people who have left their hometowns. For a long time, he has wanted to film the subject of Chinese people wandering abroad. For example, the workers who came to North America and Malaysia back then. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/u4MErr0xLRjh1yKi9hfAxF515WvyRbCtGwP3fesB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/u4MErr0xLRjh1yKi9hfAxF515WvyRbCtGwP3fesB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255318&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The era when the Sino-Russian train robbery occurred and the story of Chinese people living overseas attracted Qiu Litao to direct the film &quot;Operation Moscow&quot;. The picture is a still from the film. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the film producer)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the filming of &quot;Operation Moscow&quot;, Gui Youming experienced the efficiency of Qiu Litao&#39;s team up close. If the start time is 8:30 in the morning, his car usually arrives at 8:15. “As soon as he gets out of the car, Jason (executive director Wen Zhenwei) runs up to him and tells him that the director has arranged this like this and that. &quot;Start the first shot at 8:30 on time, &quot;then shoot, shoot, shoot&quot;, and half an hour after lunch, &quot;continue to shoot, shoot, shoot&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, the new crown epidemic is still spreading. Gui Youming remembered that Qiu Litao had never been infected with the new coronavirus and only had a cold. From July to early October, I had six days off and one day off. I basically worked 14 hours a day on the set, which was &quot;completely superhuman.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Film researcher and film critic Kai Yin is a fan of Qiu Litao. In the early summer of 2021, he visited the crew of &quot;Jedi&quot; in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan. What impressed Kaiyin deeply was that Qiu Litao did not drink alcohol. Even when producers and investors came, he only drank plain water. After dinner, he left the table and said he would be filming the next day. &quot;I can&#39;t imagine how he interacts with people... He doesn&#39;t make people feel awkward. People think he&#39;s quite amiable and are willing to invest money in making movies for him. He definitely has some of his own qualities in social interactions or how he behaves with others. A more interesting technique.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Director Qiu, I can speak on his behalf: &#39;Sorry, I don&#39;t drink when filming, okay? Of course it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t like drinking, it&#39;s just that I don&#39;t drink when filming. , OK?&#39;&quot; Gui Youming explained to Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;Director Qiu said this very sincerely, and everyone is OK.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Gui Youming&#39;s view, another director and team need Qiu Litao may only need 99 days to complete a task that takes 150 days. He has made nearly a hundred movies, &quot;horror movies, action movies, literary dramas, everything.&quot; In addition, he is a photographer, so he knows the placement of the camera and the cooperation of the team, and rarely needs to stop on the scene. Come to think of it, there are very few retakes and retakes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is an opera scene with strong dramatic conflict in &quot;Operation Moscow&quot;, involving complex camera scheduling. There were more than 70 people playing a symphony on the stage, and there were more than 700 extras off the stage. The actors were walking around among them, but Qiu Litao managed every shot in just two or three takes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I asked the director if he wanted to take a few more shots. He said no, yes. It will be very good when it is edited in the future, and there will be no waste.&quot; Gui Youming said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We don’t have to worry about whether the things we shoot are useful or useless. If you worry every day that the task is not completed, or too much money is spent, or the money spent does not match the output at all, then Is there any room to make things better?&quot; Gui Youming explained that this is why many investors believe that working with Qiu Litao will be much less stressful. &quot;Every penny spent will definitely be shown on the screen, no Any possibility of paying tuition fees”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the Xishuangbanna site, Kaiyin felt Qiu Litao&#39;s efficient dispatching ability. The latter often has several things running in the brain at the same time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, when I was shooting this scene, I was thinking about the special effects on the mountain over there and how to move the car in the next scene. In one scene, a gun battle scene involving police and gangsters was being filmed 30 to 40 meters in front of him. At the same time, he was experimenting with the water flow rate and water release position for another scene in which a flood rushed down from a mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whenever the gunfight scene ahead shouted &quot;cut&quot;, Qiu Litao in the tent would open the curtain, use a walkie-talkie to instruct the staff on the mountain to release water, test the effect, and wait until the lighting of the front camera was adjusted. , he closed the tent and filmed the next scene, racing against time. In the afternoon, the position of the water was adjusted, and the camera immediately moved over to take this shot. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Fight for Life&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From 1981 to 1984, Qiu Litao studied film at the School of Communication at Hong Kong Baptist University. He first studied journalism because he was influenced by &quot;All the President&#39;s Men&quot; (a classic film adapted from the autobiography of the Watergate whistleblower in Hong Kong translation) and wanted to become an investigative reporter. The following year, he was influenced by his teacher and switched to film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In that era, students all yearned to intern at Radio Television Hong Kong before graduation. Because the TV program &quot;Under the Lion Rock&quot; produced by the Television Department of RTHK (directed by Maggie Cheung, Ann Hui, etc.) is the dream work of every film student. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Litao also went to Radio Television Hong Kong for an interview, but was unsuccessful. He went to work as an assistant director at Asia Television arranged by the school. After one day of work, he was told not to come. Qiu Litao suffered from polio when he was a child and had difficulty moving. Later he learned that this was a &quot;kind intention&quot; from the TV station to understand him. After several teachers recommended him, he was able to continue working. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If your ability to intern for three months is doubted due to your physical condition, you will have to risk your life to enter the film industry in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After entering the industry, Qiu Litao worked as a photography assistant, and later became the photographer of director Huang Tailai. &quot;When the Hong Kong film industry took off in the 1960s, a studio apprenticeship system was formed.&quot; Kai Yin told a Southern Weekend reporter. As shown in the documentary &quot;Dragon and Tiger Warriors&quot;, in the golden age of Hong Kong movies where action scenes dominated, a large number of martial arts practitioners came from poor backgrounds and had no chance to study. They relied on physical strength and blood and sweat to maintain the operation of &quot;Oriental Hollywood&quot;. Qiu Litao was one of the few college students in the industry at that time, but he quickly put in intense labor to prove himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he was a photographer in the 1980s, Qiu Litao tried to move a lamp up a hillside. If it was 2.5K, the person asking would ask if it was enough light, and not have to change it later. If you move a 4K one, they may say that 4K is so heavy, so a 2.5K one is just fine, and you have to toss it back and forth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the day he met Southern Weekend reporters, Qiu Litao walked with a huge stride. This may be a habit formed over the years. Kaiyin explained that in the film era, a 35mm film box itself weighed several kilograms. Photographers often carried more than ten kilograms while exercising, and their hands could not shake. &quot; It&#39;s hard for me to imagine how he did this... He must have worked harder than others.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zhongzhi, the action director of &quot;Moscow Operation&quot;, was born in a family and is a famous action director in Hong Kong. He has won the Hong Kong Film Awards and the Taiwan Film Golden Horse Award for Best Action Design many times.他和邱礼涛1980年代就在片场认识，一个是武行，一个是摄影指导，用他的话说，邱礼涛是“比一个腿脚方便的人还要走得快的人”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他向南方周末记者回忆，2000年后，邱礼涛有一次在喜马拉雅山拍片，“那个地方空气很稀薄，走路不能快，一快就很快没气。可是拍完一个镜头，就看到他在雪地里一个人跑，下个镜头之后，又马上开始走下去”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这也是邱礼涛经历过的年代对他的塑造。巅峰时期，香港电影年产量超过两百部，美国学者大卫·波德维尔在《香港电影的秘密》中形容，这个六百万人居住的城市，拥有全球规模数一数二的电影王国，“输出的电影之多，只仅次于美国”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1980年代至1990年代前半期香港电影工业高速运转时期，参与者工作量巨大。最近一次采访中，邱礼涛说那时可以三天不睡觉，每天放饭那15分钟补觉，撑过醒来后的10分钟就好。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我觉得邱礼涛在1980年代经受的这种训练是很重要的，而且他比别人更清楚，你要在这么特殊的电影环境里一直处于上升状态，只有做得更有效率才行。所以他的口碑从1980年代末作为摄影师开始就是以效率见长，能一次过绝不两次。”开寅解释。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“才艺有限”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;正式入行前，邱礼涛向往拍摄的《黄土地》和《童年往事》这样的电影，但他很快明白这在香港当时的环境中是不被允许的。开寅形容那时普遍的行业氛围不是追求艺术品质和思想表达，“商业电影就是一个商业产品”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;到了1990年代下半期，受亚洲金融危机、盗版盛行、好莱坞冲击等多重因素影响，香港电影开始走向衰落。拍完《阴阳路》系列后，邱礼涛有过一段心理低潮。他向南方周末记者解释，这就好像在内地影视工业里，忽然一段时间某种类型题材——比如古装、穿越不能开工了，那么这些从业者会面临紧张和不安——他担心再没下部电影可拍。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;行业低谷期，邱礼涛完成了具有作者表达的电影。那时，观众已经对传统的动作、武侠题材电影感到乏味，1990年代，作为制片人的李修贤开发了用更低成本拍摄血腥三级片的奇案系列。 1993年，邱礼涛的代表作《八仙饭店之人肉叉烧包》上映，这部影片和《的士判官》和《伊波拉病毒》后来被称为“香港Cult片变态三部曲”，但是三级片的商业类型元素隐含着作者对香港社会底层和边缘者的关注。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我觉得这个题材帮了邱礼涛很大的忙，他意识到可以做点不一样的，因为人物本身很出挑，题材非常冷血，或者非常残酷。”开寅说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由于工多艺熟，邱礼涛这时已经在大量小成本实践中磨练出一套“经济美学”。开寅解释，摄影师出身的邱礼涛，懂得怎样用摄影机的运动和角度去弥补制景和服化道的成本缺陷。 “邱礼涛让所有人的脑子都转了一下机，我们不用拍像成龙似的满香港开着车到处追、到处撞才能吸引观众……你只需要给我一个意念性的暴力就能代替刺激。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;影评人林震宇认为，自《八仙饭店之人肉叉烧包》开始，“邱礼涛部分定性为较激烈的社会问题电影里，集中处理、展现极端血腥画面，对生命的折磨（包括人和动物）毫不留情，他九十年代初期的电影志达到一个疯狂失控的状态，九十年代末至2000年的电影，则把残酷化为黑暗的讽刺符号”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;开寅认为，贯穿邱礼涛不同片子的核心基点是一个发自本能的愤怒情绪。这可能来自他受到摇滚乐、无政府主义运动的文化影响，但对于观众来说，这是一种对日常生活的解脱。 “你可能在日常生活中积累了很多愤怒或不满，没有办法以正常的形式发泄出来，你看一部电影，这种情绪被有目的地释放出来。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2015年，邱礼涛在香港岭南大学取得文学研究博士学位。在《一个电影导演的文化思考与实践》一书中，邱礼涛曾解释，他称为“拍电影作为文化研究”的想法萌生于1980年代末。他正身处澳门为一部商业电影卖命，“那一刻我在想：为什么要拍电影？电影应该有更多可能性……于是，我拍了一些电影：关于被人视为&#39;厌恶性&#39;行业的殡仪从业员故事《阴阳路3之升棺发财》、关于边缘青少年的《给他们一个机会》和关于被歧视社群的《性工作者十日谈》。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《拆弹专家2》也是将商业动作片与社会表达结合成功的范例。一位观众在豆瓣网这样形容这部电影：你能看出它的主创经历过严苛而完整的工业化训练，不让人疲倦，还有恰如其分的爽。如果深挖，又给你思考人和社会、正义与邪恶关系的空间。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在南方周末记者的采访中，邱礼涛回应了许多外界的争议。谈到1年内有4部戏密集上映，他说这在香港过去是常事，曾经同一天电影院里有3部他的电影在上，“观众都习惯了”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他反驳烂拍的说法，并认为说他赶工并不准确。他抬一抬头回忆，挨着数——“《暗杀风暴》是2018年拍的、《扫毒3》是2021年拍的、《莫斯科行动》是2022年拍的、《绝地追击》是2021年拍的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“你可以说我有些multitask，同时做很多东西……可是《绝地追击》我们弄这个剧本弄了一年多，如果出来都不好，这是我们的才艺有限，我也可以承认，但是花的时间不是人家想象得那么短，也跟其他的制作一样得长。能够快一点我希望能再快一点，能多拍一点就多拍一点。”邱礼涛说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;同行者&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在邱礼涛的故事里，似乎很难绕开他的同伴。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他的搭档多是这个行业里的老“法师”，除了李忠志，摄影指导陈广鸿曾担任《英雄本色》的摄影师，也是邱礼涛的多年搭档，从《阴阳路》《竞雄女侠秋瑾》……一路合作至《莫斯科行动》，他年过七旬，“在现场跑来跑去，像个年轻人一样。”桂侑铭说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;开寅形容邱礼涛团队有种异乎寻常的默契，甚至很难知道他们之间是怎么沟通的。因为他们很少说话，却对彼此的需求心领神会。合作多年，李忠志知道邱礼涛需要的是真实的质感，《莫斯科行动》中有一场人从火车里摔出去的镜头，原本剧本里没有，邱礼涛便询问，如果加进去，对你的整套动作设计有没有影响。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“摔出去第一会好看，第二震撼性更大，对观众有点刺激。”李忠志理解邱礼涛的意思，于是在火车里走来走去，考虑设计什么动作更合理。 “那个玻璃那么小，又要合理地摔出去，最后想的就是在火车包间里撞那个门，门砸碎玻璃，那个人被推出去。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/yoUie951kErBJFzaNXG2Th8X9sAhQvMpUAQLa5d9.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;电影《莫斯科行动》开头的列车打斗戏，融入了邱礼涛的临场创意。 The picture is a still from the film. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（片方供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李忠志是陈木胜导演的黄金搭档，他认为两位导演很像，都是可以“拍戏不睡觉的人”。区别在于陈木胜导演会把人“榨到最干”，邱礼涛的方式则更温和。在片场，桂侑铭发现即便十分熟悉，刘德华和邱礼涛却总是小声交流，有商有量，“非常之专业”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如今李忠志的武行演员几乎都是内地人，现在香港的武行少，“慢慢都断层了”。他拍戏时，有时十个月都在怀柔。新冠疫情期间，执行导演温振威长期帮邱礼涛处理在内地的工作，时间长了，团队的一位前辈说，这两年见他比见自己的妻子都多，“慢慢大家就很像一个大家庭”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在行业的寒冬，一些人会承袭着过往的专业，也在共同体中汲取温暖。邱礼涛曾说：“有班底就要保证一直有工作，没有频密的工作，很难能凑成自己的班底。所以有时为了维持班底，只要不太违背原则的工作，也会接来做。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从这个意义上讲，开寅认为邱礼涛也许拍过质量平庸的电影，但他不认为是烂片——因为他的态度是认真的，没有刻意糊弄片方、糊弄观众。 “正因为有邱礼涛这样的导演，他在不断地开工拍片，不断地把新人纳入这个工业，才能逐渐把他们培养成人才，并以此维持香港电影工业的基本运作。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;温振威2014年毕业于香港浸会大学，从基础的场务做起，逐渐成为邱礼涛的执行导演。工作当中，邱礼涛向后辈反复强调，“先不要学那些花里胡哨的东西”，“比如做副导演，你要懂看剧本，拆剧本，你要懂很多事为什么这样安排那样安排，先把这方面的功夫练好”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;邱礼涛成长于胶片年代，他会告诉后辈，胶片年代的遗产之一便是不能乱拍，因为一开机就是钱。 “邱导经常跟我们说一个概念，就是我们不要觉得现在预算充足，就可以很随意。我们还是要保持精准，把钱花在刀刃上。”温振威说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我幸运的是拍片数量比较多，但如果你问代表性（导演），我很信服的有，但我觉得我还不是，起码对大部分电影影迷来说，我肯定不是香港最优秀的导演”，他向南方周末记者坦言，这几年想拍好片的欲望比以前大很多。因为以前怕没得拍，怕别人觉得这个行业在走下坡路；可是拍出来票房不好，被观众骂，作为导演不是没有感觉，但不会抑郁跳楼。但现在他会觉得，电影比人长寿，“你不要留一些不好的东西在世界上”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为什么一直保持这么强烈的拍片动力，邱礼涛的答案常常是在片场充实，感觉在“活着”。他向南方周末记者回忆，1980年代刚入行时，因为身体缘故，妈妈总担心他在外面工作很辛苦，“可是她不知道我在片场里面很多人照顾”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大卫·波德维尔认为香港电影创造了1970年代以来全球最富于生气和想象力的大众电影。当南方周末记者问，最想拍的好电影是什么样的？邱礼涛回答了四个字——雅俗共赏。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Fudan University professor Ge Jianxiong is the first doctor of history in New China. (People’s Vision/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 27, 1983, 17 students walked into the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. They received 200 yuan in clothing fees in advance. One of them bought a suit specially, but he couldn&#39;t tie it, so he had to ask his instructor for help. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They are the first batch of Ph.D.s in New China. Except for one who was doing postdoctoral research in the United States and did not attend, these 17 people received the &quot;Doctorate Degree Certificate&quot; with the golden national emblem at the Great Hall of the People. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the reform and opening up, doctoral training started in a hurry, and the research fields of the first batch of 18 PhDs also highlighted a country&#39;s yearning for modernization. 17 of them were PhDs in science and 1 was a PhD in engineering. . &lt; /p>; &lt;p>;40 years later, the questions that confused Su Buqing are also asking more people. According to the &quot;2022 National Education Development Statistical Bulletin&quot;, 82,300 doctoral students will graduate in 2022, and 556,100 doctoral students will be studying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023 is the 40th anniversary of the graduation of the first batch of doctoral students in New China. The birth of the first batch of Ph.D.s witnessed the development of China’s degree system from scratch. Nowadays, facing the huge group of doctoral students, further improving the quality of training has become a new development focus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Gang, a professor at the School of Education of Central China Normal University, believes that doctoral education should not only expand quantity, but &quot;quality must be the lifeline of doctoral training.&quot; In his view, China has spent 40 years going through the path of exploration that other countries have taken for hundreds of years, and has formed a doctoral education system that is in line with China’s reality and is still gradually improving. “The 40-year development history of doctoral education is also a doctoral education system. A History of Educational Reform.” &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Twisted Exploration&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The establishment of China’s doctoral system has been full of twists and turns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China, although there was a degree system covering bachelor&#39;s, master&#39;s and doctoral degrees, no doctorate was awarded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Gang explained that although the system had been established, the country was poor and weak at that time, and the number of undergraduate and master&#39;s students was limited, which &quot;was not enough to support the development of doctoral education.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 1956, the seventh year after the founding of New China, the &quot;Degree Regulations of the People&#39;s Republic of China (Draft)&quot; were submitted to the central government for approval, dividing degrees into master&#39;s and doctoral levels. However, due to various reasons, the regulations were not formally promulgated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the exploration of the associate doctorate system is also underway. In 1955, the Chinese Academy of Sciences officially proposed to learn from the Soviet Union and establish an associate doctorate system, and announced the first batch of 65 admissions the following year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Soviet Union, an associate doctorate was second only to a doctorate, and was also called a &quot;candidate doctor.&quot; A doctorate was not obtained through postgraduate education, but was applied for after accumulating many years of work experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, the &quot;First Five-Year Plan&quot; had been implemented, which clearly proposed the establishment of a preliminary foundation for socialist industrialization. Zheng Gang told Southern Weekend reporters that there is an urgent need for high-level talents in both industry and higher education. Under the background of learning from the Soviet Union, associate doctoral students came into being. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But this exploration also failed to continue. Soon after, the former Ministry of Higher Education issued a notice, &quot;It was decided not to use the name &#39;associate doctoral students&#39;. All associate doctoral students recruited last year (1956) will be called graduate students.&quot; More than a month later, it was decided not to award an associate doctorate. Zheng Gang learned that &quot;the vast majority of associate doctoral students who had enrolled at that time only received graduation certificates and no degree certificates.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind this are not only the influence of international politics, but also the difficulty of connecting the associate doctorate system with the mainstream international degree system. In addition, some universities recruit associate doctoral candidates who are not part-time workers, causing many university teachers and hospital doctors to have their work affected in order to obtain a degree. Ai Zhisheng, then deputy secretary of the Party Committee of Tsinghua University, once described him as &quot;ignoring what is going on outside the window and focusing on getting a doctorate degree.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Soon, the establishment of China’s degree system ushered in another opportunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 12, 1961, Nie Rongzhen, then Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the State Science and Technology Commission, proposed to the central government “suggestions on establishing a system for degrees, academic titles, engineering and technical titles, etc.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He elaborated on four reasons in his suggestions, including urging intellectuals to march towards the peak of science and culture, encouraging and promoting the rapid growth of a large number of young intellectuals, and accelerating the formation of China&#39;s strong scientific and cultural team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He also believes that the implementation of the degree system is also an effective way to directly promote the development of science and technology, &quot;Because in order to give degrees, it is necessary to make academic evaluations of the research work of relevant scientific and technical personnel. Through this Academic evaluation can promote academic prosperity and improve the level of science and technology in our country.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eleven days later, in his speech on &quot;Promoting a Large Number of Young Technical Cadres&quot;, Deng Xiaoping proposed, &quot;It seems that we can&#39;t do it without a degree. You can make a plan first.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Benxia, ​​former director of the Office of the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council, once wrote an article recalling that at the end of 1963, the Ministry of Education received a call from the responsible comrade of the Science and Technology Cadres Bureau of the State Council. Deng Xiaoping had reviewed and approved the &quot;Degree Regulations (Draft)&quot; and reported Other leading comrades of the Central Committee circulated it and &quot;everyone felt very excited.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The excitement did not last long. Due to various reasons, the draft failed to enter the national legislative process and was once again shelved. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;How to determine the award criteria? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 1978, postgraduate enrollment resumed. Although the degree system has not yet been established, some schools have begun to train doctoral students with good foundation before admission and outstanding achievements after admission according to the requirements of doctoral students. Zheng Gang told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;The practice of doctoral training is earlier than the system, which reflects society&#39;s eager need for doctors.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What kind of students are taking the lead in pursuing doctoral degrees? Among the first batch of 18 doctoral degree recipients, 7 are from the University of Science and Technology of China. The article &quot;Some Experiences of the First Batch of Doctoral Training in Our School&quot; published by the Graduate School of the school in &quot;Degrees and Graduate Education&quot; provides more details. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take the seven graduate students at the University of Science and Technology of China as an example. Their average age is 34 years old, they have family burdens, some have not completed formal university courses, and their studies were useless after graduation, but their basic qualities are very good. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The University of Science and Technology of China realized that the seven graduate students were not admitted according to degree standards. &quot;Are they supporting and encouraging them to become doctoral students, or are they all indiscriminately restricted to the master&#39;s degree? This is a test of our Can we adhere to the principle of starting from reality?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While exploring doctoral training, the establishment of a degree system has once again been put on the agenda. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 24, 1979, Hu Qiaomu reported to Deng Xiaoping on the issue of establishing a degree system, &quot;It would be a great good thing if the decision can be announced soon.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Benxia participated in the drafting work. He wrote that the drafting team collected archival materials from the previous two Degree Regulations (Draft) and investigated the development of foreign degree systems since the mid-1960s. A symposium was held to conduct on-site research on the current situation of higher education, and it took nearly 7 months to complete the first draft. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 1, 1980, the State Council submitted the &quot;Degree Regulations (Draft)&quot; to the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress for review. Wu Benxia attended the meeting as a non-voting delegate. &quot;Everyone unanimously raised their hands and applauded warmly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Degree Regulations&quot; are scheduled to come into effect on January 1, 1981. This is the first law in the field of education in New China, clarifying that degrees are divided into three levels: bachelor&#39;s degree, master&#39;s degree, and doctoral degree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Soon, the State Council approved the first batch of 151 doctoral degree-granting units, 812 disciplines and majors, and 1,155 instructors. Among the disciplines and majors, there are 265 engineering, 233 science, and 153 medicine. Shen Wenqin, deputy director of the China Doctoral Education Research Center at Peking University, told Southern Weekend reporters that the first batch of disciplines and majors are concentrated in basic fields and are urgently needed by the country. &quot;The selection of doctoral supervisors is also very strict.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After becoming the first batch of doctoral degree-granting units, the University of Science and Technology of China wants to take another step forward and award doctoral degrees to graduate students recruited in 1978 who have reached the academic level of a doctoral degree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 5, 1982, the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council responded to the Ministry of Education and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, agreeing to provide doctoral degree course education and thesis defense for individual graduate students with higher academic levels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, 8 units including the University of Science and Technology of China, Fudan University, and East China Normal University were approved for pilot testing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the real problem for these schools is how to judge the criteria for awarding a doctorate? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to make the opinions more representative, the University of Science and Technology of China hires up to 9 experts at a time when reviewing graduation thesis. When reviewing Li Shangzhi&#39;s paper, the opinions of experts were not unanimous. Three people believed that it had reached a doctoral level, and another one believed that it had reached a &quot;master&#39;s degree or above.&quot; Li Shangzhi then wrote two more papers, which finally passed the review smoothly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/jJQqzvhOzZtwDScsCXl9N0nfnrzijZCdTBzvPhhZ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;643&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/jJQqzvhOzZtwDScsCXl9N0nfnrzijZCdTBzvPhhZ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255344&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Among the first batch of 18 Ph.D.s in New China, 7 are from the University of Science and Technology of China. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(People&#39;s Vision/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Who will train doctors? &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Who trained the first batch of PhDs? Since the establishment of the degree system in 1981, a method has been formulated and implemented for the unified review of doctoral supervisors (hereinafter referred to as &quot;doctoral supervisors&quot;) by a national organization. After five batches of reviews, 8,043 doctoral supervisors were approved nationwide, and by the end of 1993, a total of more than 14,000 doctoral supervisors had been trained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such a doctoral supervisor qualification review process was once helpful in ensuring the quality of doctoral training, but it has gradually exposed problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Zhanjun, former deputy director of the Degree and Graduate Education Development Center of the Ministry of Education, once analyzed that with the increase in doctoral authorization units and doctoral authorization points, the scale of doctoral student enrollment has gradually expanded, and the doctoral supervisor review cycle is long, the procedures are cumbersome, and the positions are Shortcomings such as alienation are increasingly mismatched with the development situation of higher education, and &quot;the enthusiasm of higher education institutions cannot be fully mobilized.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The corresponding change is that in the 1990s, several batches of Ph.D.s mainly stayed in universities after graduation. Shen Wenqin told Southern Weekend reporters that they were already equipped to take over the academic field. Developing the capabilities of the next generation of Ph.D. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Underlying the discussion on the qualification review of doctoral supervisors is the issue of &quot;unity over control&quot; of universities, which is directly related to the autonomy of universities in running schools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 1993, the &quot;Opinions on Further Reforming the Examination Methods for Degree Authorization&quot; reviewed and approved by the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council stated that doctoral supervisors should be determined by the degree-granting units themselves in accordance with the basic standards and conditions established by the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two years later, the power to approve doctoral supervisors will be delegated to all doctoral granting units. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To solve the problem of who should train doctors, we must also solve the problem of positioning of doctorate training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A typical case is that because the medical doctors trained in China focus on experiments and scientific research training, there is a phenomenon that graduated clinical medical doctors are not qualified for clinical medical work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Gang said that society has diverse needs for talents. In addition to people who specialize in academic research, there is also a need for people to solve practical problems raised by society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1997, doctoral education ushered in another important change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April of this year, the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council reviewed and approved the &quot;Several Opinions on Adjusting the Type of Medical Schools and Establishing Medical Professional Degrees&quot;, establishing a professional doctorate in clinical medicine for the first time, requiring a focus on engaging in a specific occupation. Practical work ability, with the goal of cultivating applied talents for senior clinicians, stomatologists, health and epidemic prevention, and new drug research and development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above opinions point out that this &quot;is conducive to the targeted training of various specialized talents with different natures and different professional backgrounds, and is conducive to the society&#39;s selection and use of various types of specialized talents.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Fengliang, a professor at the Graduate School of Education at Tsinghua University, told Southern Weekend reporters that the landmark significance of this move is that &quot;doctoral education is developing in a diversified direction.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, China has established six professional doctorate types: engineering, stomatology, education, veterinary medicine, clinical medicine and traditional Chinese medicine. According to statistics from the Ministry of Education, as of 2019, China has awarded a total of 48,000 doctoral professional degrees. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“There is a long way to go”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As a doctor at the highest level of academic education, he must be able to deal with the practical problems that the country needs to solve most. “If a doctor can’t solve it, Who else can solve it?&quot; In Zheng Gang&#39;s view, the baton has been passed to the new generation of doctors. &quot;The burdens on them are no lighter than those of their predecessors, or even heavier.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the number of doctors continues to increase, Against the background of growth, in 2007, the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council, the Ministry of Education, and the former Ministry of Personnel jointly launched a systematic investigation of doctoral training. As of that year, a total of 240,000 people in China had been awarded doctorates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After going deep into 289 doctoral training units across the country, 69,133 questionnaires were collected, and after interviewing more than 400 people, the investigation team recommended that the development scale of academic doctoral education be controlled and that academic doctoral education should shift from focusing on scale to Shifts that focus on quality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before this survey, new policies that focused on quality had already appeared in practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as 1999, the then Minister of Education Chen Zhili proposed that not only outstanding doctoral theses should be selected, but also other theses should be randomly checked to ensure that the overall quality of Chinese doctoral degrees continues to improve. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2000, the Department of Degree Management and Graduate Education of the Ministry of Education has been responsible for conducting random inspections of doctoral theses. The evaluation content includes the innovativeness of the paper, the theoretical basis and expertise embodied in the paper, and scientific research capabilities. Since then, the number of random inspections has been increased. In order to achieve &quot;zero interference&quot; with the inspected units, degree-granting units are no longer required to submit thesis materials, but will be retrieved directly from the National Library after extraction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, it is stipulated that degree authorization sites with a high proportion of &quot;problematic theses&quot; or a large number of papers will be ordered to make rectifications within a time limit. If the requirements are still not met after rectification, the degree authorization will be revoked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2005, the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council issued the &quot;Some Opinions on Carrying out Periodic Evaluation of Doctoral and Master&#39;s Degree Authorization Points&quot; and decided that starting from that year, the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council would conduct regular evaluations of doctoral and master&#39;s degree authorization points every six years. Regular evaluation, the main content of the evaluation includes &quot;talent training situation, especially the quality of talent training.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Improving the quality of doctoral training is also reflected in the selection of students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, examinations were an important way to select doctors. Shen Wenqin told a reporter from Southern Weekend that candidates with scientific research talents or abilities are not necessarily good at taking exams. If standardized tests are used to screen talents at the doctoral level, &quot;the effect is not so ideal.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, the General Office of the Ministry of Education issued the &quot;Notice on Recruiting Doctoral Graduate Students in 2017&quot;, proposing to promote and improve the &quot;application-assessment&quot; enrollment and selection mechanism, and strengthen the professional quality and academic level. , comprehensive evaluation of scientific research capabilities, innovation potential and overall quality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called &quot;application-assessment&quot; system means that candidates no longer take the entrance examination uniformly organized by the school, but review materials such as academic transcripts, proposed scientific research ideas, and original research results. Afterwards, each department will assess the application through written examinations, experiments, interviews, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the same year, many universities such as Nankai University, Harbin Institute of Technology, and Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications implemented this system. Starting from the 2023 academic year, the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences will fully implement the “application-assessment” system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back on the 40 years of doctoral education in China, from scratch to excellence, &quot;doctoral education has a long way to go&quot; and there are different problems and challenges at each stage.

In the venue, the upper and lower floors were filled with teachers and students from various universities. Ma Zhongqi was the only doctor sitting on the rostrum. He was &quot;extremely nervous&quot; to speak as a representative. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason he was selected to speak is most likely because he is the &quot;first&quot; among the first batch of doctors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Zhongqi comes from the Institute of High Energy Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Qian Sanqiang, a nuclear physicist, then director of the Department of Mathematics and Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and a member of the faculty, issued his doctorate certificate.

Among them, 6 are from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 6 are from the University of Science and Technology of China, 4 are from Fudan University, and two are from East China Normal University and Shandong University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“One of the obvious characteristics of the first batch of graduate students who obtained doctorate degrees is that they are older, generally around forty years old.” In his speech at the scene, Ma Zhongqi mentioned age. At that time, Ma Zhongqi was 43 years old. It took him 16 years from his first graduate school to graduating with a doctorate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1956, 16-year-old Ma Zhongqi entered the physics department of Lanzhou University and stayed at the school to teach after graduation. In 1964, the state mobilized on-the-job cadres to take postgraduate examinations. Ma Zhongqi was admitted to the Department of Physics of Peking University and studied under Hu Ning, a theoretical physicist and member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. His studies were interrupted a year later during the political movement. In 1967, Ma Zhongqi returned to Lanzhou University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was not until 10 years later, in 1977, that the State Council approved the Ministry of Education&#39;s &quot;Opinions on the Recruitment of Postgraduate Students in Colleges and Universities&quot; and postgraduate education was resumed. In 1978, 38-year-old Ma Zhongqi was admitted to Hu Ning&#39;s graduate school again and entered the Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Institute of High Energy&quot;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I have been holding back for ten years and cannot do scientific research. I am very anxious.” Ma Zhongqi said in an interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend. Due to his previous academic accumulation, this time he became the &quot;big brother&quot; of his classmates in the Institute of High Energy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 1980, at the 13th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Fifth National People&#39;s Congress, the &quot;Degree Regulations of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; was reviewed and approved, and three-level degrees including bachelor&#39;s, master&#39;s and doctoral degrees were established. The regulations have been implemented since 1981. The Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the University of Science and Technology of China, Fudan University, Shandong University, and East China Normal University became the first batch of pilot units and began to train doctoral students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Zhongqi recalled that in August of this year, the organization talked with him and decided to select a group of graduate students with good foundations to become doctoral students directly. He was selected as a &quot;pilot&quot; and asked to &quot;write a high-level doctoral thesis as soon as possible.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In four months, Ma Zhongqi completed writing his graduation thesis. On February 6, 1982, Ma Zhongqi defended his thesis in a classroom of the Institute of High Energy. The defense committee has a luxurious lineup, consisting of 7 top experts in the field of physics: the chairman is Peng Huanwu, the father of the &quot;two bombs and one satellite&quot;, and there are also 4 members of the academic department: Hu Ning, Zhu Hongyuan, Dai Yuanben, and Gu Chaohao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After graduation, Ma Zhongqi stayed at the Institute of High Energy and was engaged in theoretical physics research, focusing on group theory methods and their physical applications, until his retirement in 2005. In 1991, he was awarded the title of &quot;Chinese Doctorate Recipient with Outstanding Contributions&quot;. He has enjoyed special government subsidies since October 1992, and has won the second prize of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Scientific and Technological Progress Award three times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Physicist and Nobel Prize winner Yang Zhenning commented that Ma Zhongqi&#39;s research results are &quot;work that can be retained.&quot; &quot;It&#39;s great to leave a hilltop like Mr. Yang did.&quot; Ma Zhongqi said that his work is like &quot;little bricks.&quot; &quot;When the flood comes, the sediment is washed away, but the &#39;little bricks&#39; can stay.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Assigned&quot; to study physics&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 凯体_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When you were an undergraduate student at Lanzhou University, your chosen major was physics. How did you become interested in physics? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Zhongqi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 1956, the central government issued a policy on developing the northwest and authorized Lanzhou University to go to Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin before the college entrance examination. Each high school selects students. I went to high school in Shanghai Shidong Middle School. Before the college entrance examination, the principal talked to me and asked me to apply for the Physics Department of Lanzhou University. At that time, the party&#39;s needs were my wishes. If I was asked to go to Lanzhou, I went without any objection. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The major was also decided, and I was asked to choose physics. When I was in high school, I heard from my relatives who were in college that the physics department was the best and I could learn a lot. At that time, I wanted to study physics myself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A total of 60 students went to Shanghai in that session. We took the train to Xi&#39;an, and then chartered a &quot;stuffy truck&quot;. We got on the train in the morning and arrived in Lanzhou the next evening. As soon as I got off the car, I was hit by a gust of wind carrying loess. At that time, tap water was not yet widely available in Lanzhou, and there were still water trucks on the road, clanging and clanking to deliver water. At school, we lived in a bungalow with no glass, just paper windows. At that time, living conditions were very difficult, but the enthusiasm was very high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How is it going in school? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Zhongqi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 1956, I studied hard in school for a year. It is a pity that since 1957, with the &quot;Ming Fang&quot; movement, anti-rightist movement, and then the &quot;Great Leap Forward&quot;, people basically stopped studying. I also saw wood, made steel, and carried loads at the waterworks. I didn&#39;t have enough to eat at that time, and I was reluctant to leave the canteen every day. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, the school would show movies every night, telling everyone not to study and to rest. But everyone finally got the opportunity to go to school, and they all studied hard. Many people fell ill due to swelling from studying, and even after being admitted to the hospital, they continued to study. It was really hard to study at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What did you do after graduating from Lanzhou University in 1961? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Zhongqi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After graduation, the school assigned me to stay at Lanzhou University as a teaching assistant, and the teaching task was very heavy. I taught 3 courses: mathematical methods, theoretical mechanics and electrodynamics, each of which required very high mathematics. There are a total of 240 students. I will correct every assignment. A pile of exercises is handed in every two weeks. When the assignments are handed in, I basically don’t leave the office for two whole days. I also have Q&amp;A classes 4 times a week, once every two hours, and I can’t stop talking. Before I even went to the classroom, students began to line up and surrounded me from all directions to ask questions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Except for doing laundry on Saturday night, there is no extra time left, not even time for watching movies. We were already &quot;996&quot; at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be honest, I didn’t study well in my own classes, so I just got through in college. The three years I spent as a teaching assistant gave me time to learn the basics of physics in a down-to-earth manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In 1964, the state mobilized serving cadres to take the postgraduate entrance examination, and you went Graduate student at Peking University. Can you tell us about your experience preparing for graduate school? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Zhongqi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The condition for in-service cadres to take the postgraduate examination was that they must return to their original units after graduation. When I took the postgraduate examination in 1964, my employer decided to let me take the exam. Each teaching and research section of the school sent a teacher to take the exam, and the theoretical physics department chose me. I decided which school I should go to, and I chose the Department of Physics of Peking University. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our theoretical physics exams are quantum field theory, electrodynamics, and quantum mechanics. You choose two of the three professional courses, as well as politics, Chinese, and English. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the three years of teaching, I happened to have learned the physics department courses by heart. Basic knowledge can withstand the test, and when it is familiar enough, students will not be afraid to ask any questions. Therefore, sometimes good things turn into bad things, and bad things turn into good things. It’s hard to explain. When I took on the teaching task at that time, I had no idea that I would still have the opportunity to take the postgraduate entrance examination in 1964. When the opportunity came, I immediately went to graduate school. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Learn to &quot;do scientific research&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;How is life as a graduate student at Peking University? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Zhongqi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;My tutor is Hu Ning, who is very good at teaching students. His training method is that he specifies the research direction, and the students find and read the literature themselves. Group meetings are held twice a week, and all students come. Anyone who has read the literature and is willing to report can report it - what new ideas does this literature have, what makes sense, what is wrong, and where should we start? Go ahead and develop your own ideas. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the report, Mr. Hu will discuss it on the spot. If he thinks what you said is reasonable, he will organize a few people to study the issue in depth. Mr. Hu is very democratic, he will listen to our different opinions, and his discussion method is very free. I have been a graduate student for one year and have already published two papers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What influence did Mr. Hu have on you? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Zhongqi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I have never done scientific research before, and I learned what it means to do scientific research from Mr. Hu. To engage in scientific research, you just have to have an idea, come up with something, and it is valuable. From then on, I also learned to do scientific research myself. At that time, our students were very conscious and fully unleashed their originality. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You just mentioned that you studied for one year As a graduate student, what was the situation like at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Zhongqi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After studying at Peking University for one year, he was sent to the countryside to carry out the &quot;Four Clean-ups&quot;. In 1967, when the fighting began at Peking University, I returned to Lanzhou University. At that time, the school&#39;s theoretical physics laboratory had been disbanded, the library was closed, and there was nothing left. The students are still there, but they are no longer studying. I give lectures to students at the Workers&#39;, Peasants and Soldiers&#39; College, starting from the most basic middle school mathematics of making negatives plus plus, one course a week, all the way to calculus. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the Cultural Revolution, I was not involved in politics and never participated in it. I didn’t even write a single big-character poster. I study when I have time, and work the rest of the time. I am tall and in good health, and I am among the first to work. I&#39;m kidding. I am neither a driving force for revolution nor an object of revolution.

For the first time in my life, I took a train to Dalian to attend a semiconductor research conference. On the way, I ran to Beijing to visit my mentor Hu Ning. Mr. Hu is very anxious. He is engaged in particle physics, but there are no students left and no one is engaged in it. He asked me if I still wanted to engage in particle physics. I said that the school’s theoretical physics department had been disbanded and I couldn’t do it if I wanted to. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, the central government had a red-headed document supporting &quot;returning college students.&quot; College students who enrolled in 1964 and 1965 only went to college for one or two years. The central government paid for them to return to school. Tuition for a year or two. Mr. Hu suddenly had a sudden idea and asked me if I would like to be a &quot;returning graduate student.&quot; Of course I do. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1978, graduate students began to enroll students. The enrollment plan stipulates that the upper age limit is 35 years old. I was 38 years old at the time and could not take the exam. Mr. Hu contacted a group of old faculty members and proposed at the National Science Conference held that year that the graduate students admitted in 1964 and 1965 were of good quality but had not completed their studies, and they should be recalled as graduate students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, about 50 days before the exam, I saw a notice in a newspaper advertisement: graduate students admitted in 1964 and 1965 are not subject to age restrictions. After seeing this, I quickly signed up and chose the Institute of High Energy Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, where Mr. Hu also had an enrollment quota. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;There are only 50 days left, how to prepare for the exam? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Zhongqi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The difference between taking the postgraduate entrance examination in 1978 and 1964 was huge. It was very difficult to take the postgraduate entrance examination in 1964, but when I took the postgraduate entrance examination in 1978, my opponents were far behind. I was a serious college student, and I had also gone to graduate school, and I had never given up my business. Of course, 38 years old is a bit older, but I am still in my prime, and my brain is still very responsive, so there will be no problem in taking the exam. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;这次读研，正好赶上是改革开放。你觉得当时社会环境的变化对你有什么影响？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;1981年，磁单极研究是个热门选题，杨振宁先生就在做这方面的研究。正好我在《复旦大学学报》上看到了谷超豪先生（数学家，中科院学部委员）发表的文章，他提出怎么用数学方法去研究磁单极理论。我一下子感觉到这是个可以选的方向。高能所专门派我去上海出差找谷先生。他审查后觉得我选题的想法、原则都很好。回到北京，我就用群论的方法，花了大概两个半月完成了计算。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;算好后，高能所又派我出差，去上海找谷先生审查我算的结果合不合理，水平够不够，能不能当博士论文。他一点头，我就赶紧回来写论文了。 1981年11月交稿，12月，学校就把这篇论文送给全国各地研究磁单极理论的教授审查，没有收到否定意见后，就通知我准备答辩。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;还记得博士答辩的情况吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;马中骐：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;1982年2月6日，在高能所的一个教室里举行的博士论文答辩，也是第一场博士论文答辩。我的答辩委员会是最盛大的了。答辩委员会主席是“两弹一星”元勋彭桓武，答辩委员有我的导师胡宁，还有谷超豪、高能所粒子物理的权威朱洪元，理论物理所粒子物理的权威戴元本，他们都是中科院学部委员。另外，还有西北大学教授侯伯宇和中山大学教授李华钟，他们是当时粒子物理和磁单极领域最出色的专家。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;基本的工作就是重要的工作&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;我注意到你的屋子里放了不少杨振宁的书籍、照片。他对你的学术生涯有什么影响？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;马中骐：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;杨先生给我的影响太大了。 1984年，他邀请我到纽约州立大学石溪分校做访问学者。第一天见面，我给他汇报工作计划，我说还想继续在磁单极方面做研究，另外我提前做了准备，知道杨先生对量子力学很基本的一个定理——Levinson定理在做研究，我说我也想在Levinson定理上做工作。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杨先生给我说，磁单极跟着别人后面做做可以，但Levinson定理就不一样了，这是基本的工作。他说，基本的工作就是重要的工作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;之后，他把他的文章和133页的计算稿给我，我花了两个月时间把那个稿子彻彻底底弄懂了。掌握了这个方法，我再去研究Levinson定理，把它的适用条件作了修改，并把定理推广到相对论情况。后来我就变成Levinson定理的权威了，回国后这方面的文章都叫我审。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当时我就想，Levinson定理是杨先生给我的题目，我只是重新做了计算，写文章时我就打算跟杨先生合作，杨先生不干，还是让我一个人写。后来我才明白，他是爱护年轻人，如果这篇文章是我们合作发表，那人家肯定认为这是杨先生的文章，跟我就没关系了。他考虑得非常周到，给了年轻人很多机会。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;杨振宁曾评价你的研究成果是“能留得下来的工作”，怎么看这个评价？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;马中骐：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;“基本的工作就是重要的工作。”这句话是杨先生跟我说的，也是我的座右铭。我这辈子的科研都比较重视抓基本的工作。基本的工作，只要没算错，它就留下来了。像Levinson定理，我算得对就站住了，这个东西是我的，清清楚楚，上了教科书，这叫留得住的工作。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果是赶时髦的工作，整个方向就错了，过段时间就没有了。就像磁单极，最后证明磁单极没有发现，所有磁单极的工作就报废了，这就叫作留不住的工作。现在文章99%都是留不住的工作，留下来的工作是很少的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因为杨先生的教导，我就比较重视找基本的工作。有这样的工作我就非常兴奋，而且花大力气去做。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;近些年还在做什么研究吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;马中骐：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;住进养老院后，我出了三本书，有一本《Group Theory For Physicsts（物理学中的群论）》是关于群论的，是我年轻时想解决的问题，但上班时比较忙，没时间做。现在我花时间把它彻底证明、推广了。今年2月份，我收到出版社寄来的账单，有人一下买了100本。这说明把它选成教材了。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我在1993年出版了一本《Yang-baxter Equation And Quantum Enveloping Algebras(杨-巴克斯特方程与量子包络代数)》，出版社每年给我发账单，每年都有人买。虽然数量不多，但是有。有跟没有是不一样的，说明这东西站住脚了，30年过去，还有人看这本书。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你觉得对现在的大学生来说，什么是最重要的？有什么建议吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;马中骐：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我很幸运，我喜欢研究物理。别人开玩笑说，不给我发工资我都想搞，何况还有工资（笑）。我真喜欢物理，而且我只会干这个。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大学生应该多听一听，看一看，搞清楚自己喜欢什么，然后在这上面独立地钻研，不能光是玩游戏或者光是找工作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 25 Oct 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[透视我国增发2023年国债1万亿元的深意]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259232]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-25 18:34:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On the 24th, the sixth meeting of the Standing Committee of the 14th National People&#39;s Congress voted to adopt the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress The resolution approving the State Council’s additional issuance of treasury bonds and the 2023 central budget adjustment plan clarifies that the central government will issue an additional 1 trillion yuan of 2023 treasury bonds in the fourth quarter of this year. What is the purpose of issuing additional national bonds in 2023? Where will the additional national debt be used? How to manage trillions of yuan in national debt funds? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Why additional issuance: A necessary move to support post-disaster recovery and reconstruction and improve disaster prevention, reduction and relief capabilities&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Since this year, many places in our country have suffered from heavy rains, floods, Disasters such as typhoons have severely affected some areas and caused heavy losses, and local post-disaster recovery and reconstruction tasks are relatively heavy. At the same time, various types of extreme natural disasters have occurred frequently in recent years, placing higher demands on my country&#39;s disaster prevention, reduction, and relief capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held a meeting on August 17 to study and deploy flood prevention and disaster relief and post-disaster recovery and reconstruction work. The meeting proposed &quot;accelerating recovery and reconstruction&quot; and &quot;further improving my country&#39;s disaster prevention, reduction and relief capabilities.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These key tasks cannot be separated from the guarantee of &quot;real money&quot;. The relevant person in charge of the Ministry of Finance said that although the budget at the beginning of the year had arranged relevant regular disaster relief and disaster prevention and reduction funds, it was difficult to meet the needs of improving disaster prevention, reduction and relief capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Liu Yi, director of the Department of Finance at Peking University School of Economics, by combining factors such as resolving local government debt risks and ensuring &quot;three guarantees&quot; expenditures, local governments have more room to significantly increase funding arrangements in related fields through their own financial resources. Small. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The issuance of additional treasury bonds in 2023 is a major decision-making arrangement made by the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and an important measure to implement the people-centered development idea.” The relevant person in charge of the Ministry of Finance said that with strong funds Ensure the implementation of relevant work, focus on supporting post-disaster recovery and reconstruction and make up for shortcomings in disaster prevention, reduction, and relief, and overall improve our country&#39;s ability to withstand natural disasters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“From an international perspective, many countries will also make some budget adjustments in the middle of the year based on the actual situation of economic and social development.” Shi Yinghua, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Fiscal Sciences, said that based on the disaster situation in our country this year, the central government The government&#39;s issuance of additional national debt and budget adjustments are pragmatic moves that reflect the guidance of the government&#39;s efforts to ensure key expenditures. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;How to use: All funds from the additional treasury bonds issued in the fourth quarter will be allocated to local governments&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is understood that combined with the needs of post-disaster recovery and reconstruction and disaster prevention, reduction and relief work , and to coordinate fiscal affordability, the central government will issue an additional 1,000 billion yuan in 2023 national debt in the fourth quarter, and arrange all of it to local governments through transfer payments. Among them, 500 billion yuan is planned to be used this year and 500 billion yuan will be carried forward for use next year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The central government issued additional treasury bonds, but all the specific funds were used locally. This helped ease the pressure on local fiscal revenue and expenditure, further optimized the fiscal expenditure structure, and further optimized the debt structure.” Shi Yinghua explain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of use of funds, according to the Ministry of Finance, the funds will be used in eight major areas: post-disaster recovery and reconstruction, key flood control projects, natural disaster emergency response capacity improvement projects, other key flood control projects, irrigation area construction and renovation, and key water and soil projects. Loss control projects, urban drainage and flood prevention capacity improvement actions, key natural disaster comprehensive prevention and control system construction projects, and high-standard farmland construction in Northeast China and disaster-stricken areas in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This fund use arrangement spans this year and next, reflecting the continuity of the policy. The direction of fund use takes into account both the present and the long term. While supporting post-disaster recovery and reconstruction and ensuring people&#39;s livelihood, it also focuses on making up for shortcomings. , strengths and weaknesses, and strengthen long-term capacity building to resist natural disasters, which is conducive to promoting high-quality development.&quot; Shi Yinghua said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The additional treasury bonds will be issued in the fourth quarter of this year. &quot;We will start the issuance of treasury bonds in a timely manner. At present, the Ministry of Finance has made adjustments to the treasury bond issuance plan for the fourth quarter to leave room for additional issuance of treasury bonds.&quot; The official said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the next step, the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance will work with relevant departments to strengthen project review and control and allocate funds to specific projects as soon as possible. The Ministry of Finance will also issue budgets for national debt projects in a timely manner to accelerate the formation of physical workload. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“After the national debt funds are put into use, it will also help drive domestic demand and further consolidate the economic recovery.” Liu Yi said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;How to manage: The central budget will be adjusted accordingly and funds from the additional issuance of government bonds will be included in the direct mechanism&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After the issuance of additional government bonds, the central budget in 2023 will also be adjusted accordingly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is understood that central government expenditures at the same level will remain unchanged in 2023, and transfer payments from the central government to local governments will increase by 500 billion yuan compared with the budget at the beginning of the year; local general public budget expenditures will increase by 500 billion yuan accordingly, and the expenditure growth rate will increase from 5.2%. to 7.4%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the fiscal deficit has also increased accordingly. In 2023, the national fiscal deficit will increase from 3.88 trillion yuan to 4.88 trillion yuan, the central fiscal deficit will increase from 3.16 trillion yuan to 4.16 trillion yuan, and the fiscal deficit rate is expected to increase from 3% to about 3.8%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, China’s government debt ratio has been lower than that of other major world economies. In Liu Yi&#39;s view, the Chinese government currently has room for additional issuance of treasury bonds, and the overall risk after this additional issuance is controllable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to manage and use trillions of yuan in national debt funds? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The relevant person in charge of the Ministry of Finance said that in the next step, the direct mechanism will be fully utilized, all government bond expenditure funds will be included in the scope of direct fiscal funds, and the whole process tracking and monitoring will be implemented to ensure that the funds are used according to the prescribed purposes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;We will also organize the local supervision bureaus of the Ministry of Finance to establish a normalized supervision mechanism, keep a close eye on the use of government bond funds, strictly investigate illegal activities such as misappropriation of government bond funds, and effectively prevent government debt risks.&quot; This said the person in charge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 25 Oct 2023 18:55:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[北京市委常委、副市长靳伟因北京长峰医院重大火灾事故被问责]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259288]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-25 17:49:40&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;A few days ago, with the approval of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the State Supervision Commission issued a Member and Vice Mayor Jin Wei initiated a case review and investigation into the issue of dereliction of duty and dereliction of duty during the &quot;4·18&quot; major fire accident at Changfeng Hospital in Fengtai, Beijing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After investigation, Comrade Jin Wei, as a member of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee and deputy mayor in charge of health work, has gaps in the implementation of the Party Central Committee’s instructions and requirements on production safety, which has a negative impact on Beijing.

His brother will fly directly from Guangzhou to Egypt and look for an opportunity to return to his hometown of Gaza when the port opens. There, the Israeli army, which has superior military strength, is launching a fierce attack. In live video footage, bombs fell from the sky and many houses were reduced to fragments and rubble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sharif told Southern Weekend reporters that it was his brother&#39;s own decision to go back and &quot;he had no choice.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the Israeli-Palestinian conflict escalates, a humanitarian crisis is unfolding in the Gaza Strip. As of October 24, this round of conflict between Palestine and Israel has killed more than 7,200 people on both sides. According to UNICEF news on the 24th, 2,360 children were killed in the Gaza Strip and another 5,364 children were injured. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the conflict broke out, the Israeli military has required residents of northern Gaza to move to the south within a time limit, otherwise they will be regarded as &quot;accomplices of terrorists.&quot; However, many Palestinians, including Sharif&#39;s family, remain in the north. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to disclosures from multiple international rescue organizations, a total of 57 rescue trucks entered Gaza from October 21st to 23rd. But for the more than 2 million Gazans, this is undoubtedly a drop in the bucket. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There are blockades everywhere, how do we leave? Even if someone evacuates, they will be killed by air strikes on the road. More importantly, we don&#39;t want to leave our own land.&quot; Sharifou said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;In Sharif&#39;s hometown of Beit Hanoun, residents&#39; houses were reduced to ruins after the bombing.

He then contacted his family many times, but the other party&#39;s mobile phone always reminded him that he was &quot;not in the service area.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It wasn’t until 6 hours later that Sharifu contacted them again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to get in touch better, Sharifou bought an ESIM card for his parents. &quot;Just like an international roaming card, you can also use Israeli or Egyptian network services in Gaza.&quot; Sharifou added that such a card would not receive a signal all the time. When using it, people must stand at a high place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sharif comes from a merchant family in Gaza. For many years, he and his family traveled to Yiwu, Guangzhou and Gaza to trade in general merchandise such as candy, motorcycle parts, and home appliances. He and his brother have lived and worked in Guangzhou for many years, and his brother&#39;s two children also studied in Baiyun District. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not long after arriving in China, Salifu told his parents that they must come to China one day. &quot;My father was originally going to attend the Canton Fair this year.

This is the only way to save them.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;Also in Gaza, 26-year-old Ismail is worried about his family&#39;s food rations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Late at night on October 23, Ismail sent a message for help to Annie, a Chinese friend who cared about him. He wanted to borrow $1,000 from Anne and promised to &quot;pay it back to you after the war is over.&quot; He and his family are currently in a settlement in a school in Gaza, but aid agencies have provided limited help. Food on the market is scarce and expensive, and must be traded in U.S. dollars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Annie told Southern Weekend reporters that Ismail studied abroad in a university in Zhejiang and understands Chinese. The two met by chance at a party. Not long before the conflict, Ismail had consulted her on how to handle the procedures for his brother, who had graduated from high school, to study in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Annie said that Ismail uses two mobile phone numbers on a daily basis, belonging to operators in Gaza and Israel. After the conflict broke out, communication facilities in Gaza were extensively damaged. Ismail barely got in touch with Anne through an Israeli mobile phone number. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;When I was contacted, his family was preparing to go to an evacuation site near their home. Because his family did not have a car, it was not practical for the whole family to evacuate on foot,&quot; said Anne. When asked how he was doing, Ismail replied in Chinese, &quot;Not dead yet.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the day on October 24, Anne, who had raised the US dollars, contacted Ismail again, but received no reply. On the morning of October 25, I finally received news that Ismail was safe. According to his description, the fighting there was &quot;very, very severe&quot; and &quot;the sound of bombings and explosions did not stop.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I have seen three wars in Gaza before, and this is the hardest.&quot; He wrote. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Rescue is hampered at every turn&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“In Gaza, we never imagined such a scenario: 2 million civilians would live under heavy bombing and face interruptions in water, food, electricity and medicine. . We should take all measures immediately to avoid this situation from happening.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 9, local time, Fabrizio Carboni, Regional Director of the Near and Middle East of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said on social media Platform to speak out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After two weeks of Israel&#39;s sweeping siege, limited aid has finally arrived. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to public disclosures, three batches of humanitarian relief supplies entered the Gaza Strip from October 21st to 23rd local time, with a total of 57 trucks shipped. These include medical supplies, disinfectant chlorine tablets for water treatment, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, these supplies are really a drop in the bucket for the more than 2 million people in the Gaza Strip. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a speech in Luxembourg on October 23 that under normal circumstances, if there is no war, 100 trucks enter Gaza every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Obviously, 20 (trucks) are not enough.&quot; Borrell called for more humanitarian support to be provided. In particular, fuel support will be provided so that power stations and desalination stations can be operated to &quot;restore water and electricity supplies&quot; as quickly as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tamara Alifa&#39;i, spokesperson for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), also said that Gaza&#39;s need for fuel is &quot;as urgent as its need for water and food.&quot; &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despite repeated warnings from international relief agencies, the Israeli side still puts the fuel on the embargo list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mark Regev, a senior adviser to the Israeli Prime Minister, publicly stated in an interview on October 23 that Israel would not allow fuel to enter the Gaza Strip even if all hostages were released. Regev explained the reason for the embargo, &quot;These fuels may be stolen by Hamas and used to power rockets.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the conflicts between the parties difficult to reconcile, the operation of hospitals in Gaza is in trouble. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The level of death, destruction and displacement is shocking.” On October 24, Christoph Hanger, public relations officer of the International Committee of the Red Cross, gave a written interview to a reporter from Southern Weekend The agency’s team in Gaza visited hospitals in the northern region on the ground, it said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;People sleep in hospital stairwells. Thousands of people, with nowhere to go, seek shelter in hospitals. Building walls shake from nearby explosions. If the situation does not improve, there is no clean drinking water and crowded shelters, the potential for disease outbreaks increases dramatically,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shortages of electricity and fuel have put hospitals in Gaza in dire straits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Without electricity, the hospital will become a morgue.” Christopher said that after the power outage in Gaza, the hospital also stopped supplying power. Newborns in incubators and elderly patients who require oxygen are at risk. Kidney dialysis was interrupted and X-rays could not be taken. He pointed out that most hospitals in Gaza are no longer functioning and they need electricity to maintain their services. The hospital&#39;s situation has become even more difficult as insufficient fuel supplies have affected power generation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A report from surgeons at Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza showed that they worked 24 hours a day to care for the wounded; when they tried to triage patients, they found that they could not cope with the large number of casualties, and &quot;the entire system was saturated.&quot; All operating theaters are occupied”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Doctors report that there is no precedent for such large-scale casualties in previous escalations of conflict.&quot; Christopher said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 17, a hospital in northern Gaza was bombed, causing some casualties. Gaza&#39;s health authorities and the Israeli Defense Ministry called each other the attackers. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres later strongly condemned the deadly attacks on Gaza hospitals and said hospitals and medical personnel should be protected by international humanitarian law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society&#39;s disclosure on October 22, the area near the Holy City Hospital was heavily shelled that day. In the video released by it, at the moment of the attack, staff wearing Red Crescent uniforms rushed to find refuge on walls, pillars, ambulances and other places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;35 employees of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East have been killed since the conflict broke out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We are speechless.” UNRWA posted on social platforms on October 23, “We pay tribute to the 35 colleagues who were killed in Gaza since October 7. They Not just numbers. They are our friends and colleagues. Many are teachers in our schools.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Win or die&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After conflict breaks out, Israel cuts off Water and electricity supply to the Gaza Strip. On October 9, Israel announced a &quot;total blockade&quot; of the Gaza Strip controlled by Hamas and mobilized 300,000 reservists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the war imminent, Israel issued an &quot;expulsion order&quot; to the people of northern Gaza. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Israel Defense Forces informed the United Nations in the early morning of October 13 that it had notified approximately 1.1 million Palestinians in the northern Gaza Strip and required them to evacuate to southern Gaza within 24 hours. On the morning of the 14th, the Israel Defense Forces issued another notice, requiring residents in the northern Gaza Strip to evacuate through the &quot;evacuation corridor&quot; between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. that day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On an orange paper leaflet printed with the IDF logo, the Israeli army issued a warning to the Gaza people. It read: &quot;Anyone who does not evacuate from the northern valley of Gaza to the south may be considered a member of a terrorist organization.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Multiple Palestinians interviewed confirmed this to Southern Weekend reporters information. But they believe that not everyone will have convenient transportation to leave in a very short period of time. At the same time, the evacuation route is not safe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the video sent by Sharif, people evacuating in large tractor-trailer trucks were attacked on the way. On the open-air compartment that was originally filled with women, children, and children, only stumps and blood were left. In another video, in front of the evacuation road with cars, motorcycles, and donkey carts, yellow flames from bombs suddenly rose, and the vehicles turned around one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Actually, both the south and north of Gaza were bombed.&quot; Sharifou said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guterres said before the Security Council’s closed-door consultation on the Palestinian-Israeli situation held on the 13th that more than 1 million residents would be moved from a completely besieged and densely populated war zone to an area without food, drinking water and Housing areas, which are &quot;extremely dangerous&quot; and in some cases &quot;impossible&quot;. He called for the cancellation of the deportation order and hoped that all parties would avoid further escalation and spread of the situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sharifou told Southern Weekend reporters that his family will not leave Gaza even if the border is reopened. &quot;If we leave, we will lose our home forever. Like 1948 and 1967, we will not repeat the same mistakes.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;After the people evacuated, the livestock that could not be taken away Stay in the ruins.

(Photo provided by interviewee)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Sharifou’s view, Israel wants to force residents to leave Gaza... They achieve their goals step by step, “first by closing the border and sending us from the north to the south, and then Tell us to leave Gaza and go to Egypt.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sharif&#39;s worries are not groundless. After the Palestinian-Israeli conflict escalated, when US President Biden visited Israel, the United States and Israel jointly proposed a proposal to transfer Gazans to Egypt, but Egypt clearly opposed this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;They (Israel) thought that by blowing up all the bakeries, hospitals and houses, people would leave Gaza and run away. But they are wrong, people here will never leave, win or die .&quot; Sharifu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rasha.G lives in the Palestinian area of ​​the West Bank and runs a chocolate business with her husband and children. Affected by the war in Gaza, the atmosphere here has also become tense. &quot;Business is very deserted and people have nothing to celebrate.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As she said, to a certain extent, the West Bank is safer than Gaza because there are &quot;no bombs and no air strikes&quot; for the time being. But Resha felt a deep sense of crisis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Resa told Southern Weekend reporters that in the conflicts between Palestine and Israel, many Palestinians evacuated elsewhere, or moved to neighboring countries, such as Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, or moved to the Jordan River west coast. But most of them live in refugee camps. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“You can’t imagine how difficult life is in the refugee camps. There are many people living in a small space and the environment is very poor.” Resha said that in Palestine, many refugees can only rely on the United Nations Near East for their education. Relief and Works Agency. Refugees can find jobs in Palestine, and a small number can do business, but in other countries, these refugees are &quot;not even treated as citizens.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Resa is well-educated, fluent in English, and has lived in Europe for two years. But she returned to Palestine. &quot;I never thought about evacuating. I would not leave my home and become a refugee. I would rather die.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;DIVISION&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is imminent, but All parties still have differences on whether to cease fire and carry out rescue operations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of now, Spain, the Netherlands, Ireland, Slovenia and Luxembourg have publicly supported the humanitarian ceasefire. Irish Foreign Minister Michael Martin said that &quot;Gaza urgently needs access to water, food and medical supplies.&quot; &quot;The human suffering is enormous. We must distinguish between Gazan civilians and Hamas civilians.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As one of the leaders of the European Union, Germany did not respond to calls for a ceasefire. German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbock said that providing aid to Gaza was important, but large-scale rocket attacks against Israel were taking place. &quot;We cannot end the humanitarian catastrophe while terrorism in Gaza persists.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told the media on October 23 that the ceasefire will &quot;give Hamas the ability to rest, reorganize and prepare to continue launching terrorist attacks against Israel.&quot; U.S. President Biden also said on the same day that a ceasefire in Gaza would be possible only after Hamas releases all hostages it has held. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the Israeli government, the purpose of this operation was demonstrated as early as the beginning of the war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This should be our last ground offensive in Gaza, for the simple reason that Hamas will cease to exist after this.” Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant publicly stated that Israel A ground offensive will be launched in the Gaza Strip that will last for several months, aiming to completely eliminate Hamas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this context, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict continues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the latest statement from the Israeli army, the Israel Defense Forces air raided more than 400 targets of the Hamas organization in the Gaza Strip on October 23, including its armed personnel assembly areas, command centers and a road leading to the seaside. underground tunnels and killed dozens of Hamas commanders and their armed men. The Israeli army also dispatched tanks, artillery and helicopters to attack Hamas military posts and anti-tank missile launch sites. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 23, in response to a reporter’s question, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that China is very saddened by the large number of civilian casualties caused by the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the sharp deterioration of the humanitarian situation. Responding to violence with violence will only lead to a vicious cycle. The top priority is to cease fire and end the war as soon as possible. All parties should earnestly abide by international law and international humanitarian law, protect civilians, and make every effort to avoid serious humanitarian disasters. The international community should provide more humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza to alleviate the humanitarian disaster they have suffered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, China will continue to support all efforts that are conducive to promoting dialogue and restoring peace, and make efforts to implement the &quot;two-state solution&quot; and promote a comprehensive, fair and lasting solution to the Palestinian issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（南方周末记者顾月冰、南方周末实习生翟桓对本文亦有贡献）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 25 Oct 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[温州实现数据资产“入表”第一单，万亿市场仍藏水面下]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259268]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-25 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/25/dhrnvgaSoWKV9eICfGEagpNKL5CAyvz5SdzrTtK2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1268&quot; height=&quot;846&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/dhrnvgaSoWKV9eICfGEagpNKL5CAyvz5SdzrT tK2. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255346&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Data exchanges are springing up like mushrooms after a rain. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Shi Xuan/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The capitalization of data is ushering in new progress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In early October 2023, the data product &quot;Credit Data Treasure&quot; of Wenzhou Big Data Operation Co., Ltd. completed the data asset confirmation registration. The Wenzhou Municipal Finance Bureau stated in the announcement that this is the first order to confirm the registration of data assets in Wenzhou, and it is also the first order to list the data assets of a financial guidance enterprise in China that has been publicly reported. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Incorporating data resources into the balance sheet refers to recognizing data resources as an &quot;asset&quot; in the company&#39;s balance sheet, and reflecting its value in financial statements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Credit Data Treasure is developed based on the Wenzhou Government Blockchain &quot;Data Asset Cloud Voucher&quot; system. After authorization by individuals or enterprises, it provides financial institutions with data services related to credit business, simplifying loan application materials and process to improve credit approval efficiency and bank verification accuracy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2020, data was upgraded to the fifth major factor of production alongside land, labor, capital and technology, and a series of policies related to the capitalization of data were closely introduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“If you had asked me two years ago, I would have told you that most enterprises knew nothing about data capitalization.” Today, data capitalization has become a hot topic, but according to UFIDA Group Data Governance Expert Shi Xiufeng observed that most companies have not yet truly touched upon their essence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What are the difficulties in capitalizing data? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The trillion-dollar market under the water&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“First of all, it must be clear that not all data is data assets.” Deputy Director of the Price Monitoring Center of the National Development and Reform Commission Director Wang Jiandong told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the definition of China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (hereinafter referred to as the Academy of Information and Communications Technology), data assets refer to data legally owned or controlled by organizations (government agencies, enterprises and institutions, etc.), recorded electronically or by other means , such as structured or unstructured data such as texts, videos, databases, and sensor signals, can be measured or traded, and can directly or indirectly bring economic and social benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, only data that can bring value to the organization is a data asset, and its formation requires active management and effective control of data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tang Hanlin, chairman of Guizhou Databao Network Technology Co., Ltd. and general manager of East China Jiangsu Big Data Trading Center, explained to Southern Weekend reporters that data capitalization is to transform data resources into data assets, and its core is to fully release data value of resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, the development, use and market operation of public data are still being explored. In December 2022, the &quot;Opinions on Building a Data Basic System to Better Play the Role of Data Elements&quot; (also known as the Twenty Data Articles) was issued and proposed to &quot;promote the paid use of public data used for digital development in accordance with government guidance and pricing, and enterprises and A price formation mechanism that combines independent pricing in the personal information data market.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shi Xiufeng analyzed from the perspective of enterprise development that enterprises have accumulated a large amount of data in the informatization process over the past 20 years. Nowadays, these data can generate greater value, thus pushing enterprises to start data governance, realize the utilization and value maximization of data assets, and ultimately realize the digital transformation of enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Informatization refers to the realization of enterprise business process management and data recording through network, computer, database and other information technologies, such as financial computerization, OA collaborative office, etc. Digitalization is the use of digital technologies such as cloud computing and blockchain to achieve innovation in enterprise business and management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shi Xiufeng has more than 16 years of working experience in the data field. His business involves consulting and delivery in the fields of enterprise data governance, data asset management, data applications and other fields. He has led many companies in traditional manufacturing, energy and other industries. Planning and implementation of large-scale data projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shi Xiufeng believes that currently 80% of companies are still in the process of forming data assets. Wang Jiandong said that in the short term, the data infrastructure system will give rise to a data trading market of 300 billion to 500 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This 100-billion-dollar transaction will leverage the trillion-level market behind it.” Wang Jiandong said that by further considering the derivative markets such as the evaluation, pledge, and financing of data assets, the potential scale of the entire data asset market will be More than 10 trillion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He introduced that, like production factors such as land, data elements can also be explored using hierarchical governance. The primary data market is the transfer of ownership rights and open usage rights of data resources, while the secondary data market is the market for data products and services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The main part of enterprise data capitalization is still hidden under the water.” Wang Jiandong explained that currently, only a small part of the data owned by social institutions has entered the circulation and transaction process, and most of the other data They are all circulated in the zero-level market in various forms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The zero-level data market refers to the market behavior that does not enter the transaction link, but data sharing, exchange and equity transfer occur, such as within an enterprise and between enterprises with certain business or equity relationships. Another example is that data sharing and exchange occurs every moment within Internet companies, but no external transactions are conducted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jiandong said that according to preliminary calculations, the potential scale of data assets and their pledge, financing and other derivative markets in the current zero-level data market is 30 times to 60 times that of the primary and secondary markets. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Obtain a position first&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“It’s hot at the top and cold at the bottom.” Senior data Industry insider Cheng Guo described the current data capitalization process to Southern Weekend reporters. He has participated in corporate research and the formulation of industry rules for many times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Cheng Guo’s view, the only newly established deputy ministerial-level national bureau in this round of institutional reform of the State Council is the National Data Bureau. The bureau is affiliated with the National Development and Reform Commission, alongside the National Grain Administration and the National Energy Administration, which shows that senior officials regard data as a core strategic resource. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of October 25, 2023, the National Data Administration was officially launched. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The introduction of a number of relevant policies has also prompted a new wave of enthusiasm in the preparation and construction of data exchanges. After the fourth quarter of 2020, data exchanges have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain, including Shanxi, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Fujian and other places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;White Paper on Data Elements&quot; released by the Academy of Information and Communications Technology shows that as of August 2023, 53 data trading institutions have been established across the country. From January to August 2023 alone, 5 new data trading institutions have been established in the country. Home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, generally speaking, most of the data trading institutions established in the early stage have not found successful business models. Most of them have stopped operations or changed their business direction, and their development has not been as expected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The East China Jiangsu Big Data Trading Center (hereinafter referred to as the East China Data Trading Center) where Tang Hanlin works was established in 2015 and is one of the earliest data trading institutions in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said frankly that in the past, there was no clear requirement that data transactions must be conducted on exchanges. The East China Digital Exchange serves more as an announcement platform - allowing both supply and demand parties to better understand each other, in order to promote Both parties mainly conduct offline transactions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Cheng Guo’s view, the importance of data capitalization has been emphasized at the national level, but local governments are still relatively confused. &quot;Their (local government) idea is that although I can&#39;t understand this new thing yet, I will take a position first.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2021, Shenzhen Data Trading Co., Ltd. was established, and then based on The Shenzhen Data Exchange (hereinafter referred to as the Shenzhen Data Exchange) was established. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“深数所前几年的工作重点都不是提高交易额，而是培育市场生态。”2022年9月底，深数所副总经理王冠在一次会议中透露，深圳数据交易市场无论是在交易额还是在交易活跃度上，都已领跑全国。但市场供需不太平衡，供给方相对较少，需求方又很多，同时第三方服务机构和数据商的数量也不丰富。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“高质量的数据产品供给是最关键的。”上海数据交易所（下称上数所）副总经理韦志林向南方周末记者强调。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年11月底，上数所几乎与深数所同时成立。其目标明确，以“构建数据要素市场、推进数据资产化进程”为使命。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;韦志林透露，截至目前，上数所挂牌超1600个数据产品，月交易额已超一亿元，预计2023年全年交易额突破10亿元。上数所目前重点提供金融、航运交通和贸易等领域的数据产品。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其中，金融业数据交易市场存在时间较长，交付产品和金融方式更加成熟，是数据密集型行业。近五年来，金融业数据要素采购项目数量复合年增长率达40%，远超金融业采购总项目数量复合年增长率26%，显示出金融业数据交易市场规模发展迅速。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但韦志林也坦陈，当前整个数据要素市场场内交易的规模占比相对较小。 “场内交易的建设至关重要，其在合规、可信、效率和资产化方面的作用不可替代。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/PFsqMbL5vp0h984ZrkC24QdhDi3uzJfkpiLUxnNx.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2022年5月6日，天津滨海新区，一名行人从筹备中的北方大数据交易中心前走过。视觉中国/图&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王建冬表示，数据资产化未来的发力方向之一是鼓励企业尽可能多地进场交易，通过场内交易实现对其数据资产价值的确认，让交易所内形成的价格成为对数据资产估价的“锚”，这样交易所也会活跃起来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“相当于企业入场不是只为了挣交易那笔钱，而是通过交易得到资产增值的机会。”王建冬解释，企业数据资产价值得到市场认可，在后续实现资本化操作，企业才有更大积极性参与场内交易。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;汤寒林相信，对企业数据资产入表的要求，会推动数据交易市场发生很大改善，今后供需双方会更希望通过场内交易对数据资产形成一套公允的价格体系，这样才便于估价并入表。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;确权难题&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2023年8月和9月，财政部和中评协先后就数据资源入表和数据资产的评估发布相关文件，分别为《企业数据资源相关会计处理暂行规定》（下称《暂行规定》）和《数据资产评估指导意见》（下称《指导意见》）。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;两套文件一出，竞天公诚律师事务所合伙人、数据法律专家袁立志立刻接到了客户的咨询。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“会计师、审计师和评估师都希望我们律师能先出一份法律意见，作为企业数据资产入表或资产评估的基础。”袁立志对南方周末记者说，他们担心的根本原因在于数据资产的权属无法得到确认。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;业内普遍认为，实现数据资产化有三大环节也是三大挑战，分别为法律角度的数据资产确权、市场角度的数据资产估值与交易和会计角度的数据资产入表。其中，数据资产的确权是一切的前提。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在数据生产、流通、使用等过程中，个人、企业、社会、国家等相关主体对数据有着不同利益诉求，且呈现复杂共生、相互依存、动态变化等特点，传统权利制度框架难以突破数据产权困境。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;数据二十条提出，建立数据资源持有权、数据加工使用权、数据产品经营权“三权分置”的数据产权制度框架，淡化所有权、强调使用权。在一定程度上破解了数据资产确权难题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王建冬表示，“三权分置”提供了一条解决问题的基本思路。目前在技术上对数据资产登记确权已无根本性障碍，而具体实施中的难点在于缺乏上位法的支持。如证券法之于证券登记，物权法之于不动产登记。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《中华人民共和国民法典》第一百二十七条规定，“法律对数据、网络虚拟财产的保护有规定的，依照其规定”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;目前与之相关的法律法规，如个人信息保护法、数据安全法和网络安全法等，更多从数据安全和隐私保护的角度入手，均未对数据确权作出明确规定。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;袁立志介绍，在实际案例中，由于涉及的利益相关方较多，企业在开发及利用数据资产时或会碰到从各种角度提出的利益诉求，如个人信息保护、不正当竞争、商业秘密、知识产权、合同债权等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;程果在调研时发现，在此情况下，一些企业对于其数据资产入表也显现出顾虑。入表，意味着企业要接受严格审计，但目前许多企业很难说清其数据真正的权属。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实上，上述《暂行规定》和《指导意见》只是对现存相关规则的细化规范，“并没有突破现有的财务会计制度”。在袁立志看来，产权制度是市场交易的前提。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;袁立志表示，在出正式的法律文件时，律师们对数据资产合法性的判断已相对成熟，对其权属的认定则会比较谨慎。 “尤其在涉及第三方权益时，我们会根据一般的法律原理作出判断，但会保留意见”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;相关部门在出台规定时显然也意识到了其中难点。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;程果将《暂行规定》称为对数据资产的“小入表”。原因在于该文件并未针对所有数据资产，而是根据数据资源是否符合《企业会计准则——基本准则》中资产的确认条件，将其分为满足条件可“入表”的数据资源和不满足条件的“不入表”的数据资源。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，《暂行规定》是未来适用法。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;程果表示，一些企业在数据资产化的投入主要在前期，之后每年仅进行规律性的小部分投入，其入表的数据资产仅以新增投入为基础计算，不会对企业的资产规模产生太大影响。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;另辟蹊径&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;短时间内，确权难题无法解决，市场主体也开始另辟蹊径。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在韦志林看来，数据产权“三权”中数据产品的经营权，解决的便是所谓的确权难、定价难，包括数据的监管问题。在此基础上，上数所提出“数据产品”的概念。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;韦志林称，只有将数据按照一定的需求和应用场景组织加工成数据产品，才能形成有需求和供应关联的市场。这样，才能建立起相应的交易规则、标准制度、技术、生态和监管等流通交易体系。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他解释，如果流通交易的是原始数据，将会涉及数据的安全和确权等目前难以破解的问题，而“数据产品”概念的提出，很好地解决了数据的权属问题。将企业持有的原始数据加工形成的数据产品，赋予企业确定数据产品的权利，基于数据产品，企业可以享受该数据产品的经营权。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此前有媒体报道，在建设具体的数据产权制度方面，知识产权制度是唯一正在试点实践中的制度。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上海对外经贸大学法学院讲师高阳曾公开表示，知识产权作为保护无形资产财产权的制度，适用于数据具有正当性。数据经过人类创造性智力劳动方能获得较高经济价值，符合知识产权保护智力成果的范畴。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;高阳在上述采访中说，通过对满足条件的数据授予知识产权，为数据交易主体提供明确指引，提高了数据交易的安全性及效率，进而激励企业数据产品创新，以解决市场中数据产品供给不足的问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;汤寒林同样认可知识产权制度在数据确权中的应用。 2023年4月，江苏省知识产权局出台《江苏省数据知识产权登记管理规则（试行）》，华东数交是江苏省数据知识产权试点单位。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据他透露，华东数交已经和江苏省知识产权局直接打通。 “我们的数据交易商在交易所提交数据产品后，可以直接经由江苏省知产局审核，进行在线确权，由此完成一个确权的闭环服务。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据《新华日报》报道，2023年10月中旬，江苏省联合征信有限公司（下称联合征信）研发的一款数据产品“企业批量查询”，在交通银行江苏省分行获得质押融资1200万元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;联合征信是经江苏省政府批准设立的金融科技公司，是获得了央行备案的征信机构。 “企业批量查询”是联合征信在对数据清理加工的基础上，通过四十多个维度指标建构模型，最终形成的企业信息查询类数据产品，主要用于反映企业信用状况。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上述报道称，作为全国数据知识产权工作地方试点，江苏省于2023年5月颁发第一批数据知识产权登记证书。截至10月11日，江苏省已有125笔数据知识产权登记，已实现数据知识产权质押融资额五千余万元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而在数据资产的价值评估方面，王建冬一直呼吁，在国家未来的数据资产登记平台中，应该包含数据溯源功能。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这意味着企业需说明其数据资产在形成过程中每一个环节上的数据来源。通过这样的方式，可以更加公正地评估该数据资产未来的价值潜力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“随着数据资产入表和实现有效评估，企业在会计报表上有了表达，就有了实体经济活动的支撑。”韦志林认为，数据资产化的进程在入表的基础上，一定会取得更大的突破和创新。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他总结，数据资产创新应用主要有六大方向，包括数据资产入表、数据资产增信、数据资产质押融资、数据资产保理、数据资产作价入股以及数据资产证券化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者通过电话约访温州市财政局并发送采访函，对方婉拒了采访。 &lt;/p>;
