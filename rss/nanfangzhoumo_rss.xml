Hou Hsiao-hsien, and the other is Edward Yang, a programmer who returned from the United States. With a Western perspective, Edward Yang is good at capturing the urban feel, and his films are more genre-based. The urban feel of Taiwan at that time was a middle ground between rural and urban areas, and the unique flavor was very iconic in his shots. To this day, many aspects of society can still be seen in their movies. Speaking more broadly, if Edward Yang had not passed away prematurely, &quot;Taiwan&#39;s New Cinema&quot; would have had a different pattern. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taiwan&#39;s new film begins with the 1982 platter film &quot;The Story of Time&quot;, which was screened across Taiwan. Among the co-directors was Edward Yang, who studied and worked in the United States and later returned to Taiwan to make movies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Director Hou Hsiao-hsien, who had already made three romance films that were very successful at the box office, joined the following year. He and two other directors made another platter movie &quot;My Son&#39;s Big Doll&quot; - —At this time, Hou Hsiao-hsien obviously hadn’t found himself yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When a filmmaker &quot;sees himself&quot;, to be more specific, it means that his attitude towards things and people can be reflected in the film, and he cannot deceive people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hou Hsiao-hsien&#39;s style first appeared in &quot;The Man From Fengkuei&quot; in 1983. A very modern emotional state, akin to melancholy and alienation, is evident when viewed from a distance. The lives of several confused young people are observed from a distance with fixed camera positions and long lenses. The camera suddenly gained an attitude, a bit pushing away the audience and asking everyone to calm down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previous Taiwanese movies were not like this. In the early 1970s, Taiwan was dominated by martial arts films and Qiong Yao-style romance films; in the late 1970s, many pornographic or violent films appeared. Business was not business, and rurality was not rural; by the 1980s, a generation of young Taiwanese people were facing The pull between Chinese traditional spirit and Western modern culture sways with the wind in life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/OdDvG7jpCBunuQg2L77akjJfKs0toKpp5rKL2M2Y.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/OdDvG7jpCBunuQg2L77akjJfKs0toKpp5rKL2M2Y.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256536&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hou Hsiao-Hsien Zeng said in an interview: &quot;A director can only make one movie. The method of attention can change, but the angle is the same... Edward Yang left Taiwan for the United States and came back after so many years. His memory compared with his current view. I grew up in the countryside in southern Taiwan. I read classical books. Natural growth and life are my vision...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The concept of modernity in Hou Hsiao-hsien is mixed and rich, oriental Form, Eastern thinking, and the core point of view connects the West. At that time, he and several directors of the same age were discussing this matter, which attracted a lot of praise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the best years of Taiwan&#39;s new films, the average annual film production could reach about 120. &quot;This film reform movement inspired by the new generation of film workers and film directors was short-lived in the 1980s. It has experienced ups and downs in a few years, and has reached a peak that is still unreachable for Taiwanese films, giving Taiwanese films a place in the history of world cinema.&quot; This is a summary of Taiwanese new films that I have read from a lot of information. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On January 24, 1987, the &quot;Taiwan Film Manifesto&quot; was released. At this time, the peak of new films had passed and everyone began to struggle. This declaration is divided into three parts: &quot;Our views on movies&quot;, &quot;Our concerns about the environment&quot;, and &quot;The changes we expect and our own determination&quot;. I went out of my way to see the worries and doubts of these young filmmakers back then, and they proposed: We believe that movies have many possibilities, and we must strive for space for the existence of &quot;another kind of movie&quot; besides commercial movies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this point, new films as a trend have quickly dissipated. Since then, everyone’s creations have had to follow the market and personal destiny. For example, many filmmakers do not focus on the reality of Taiwan and do not seek funds from the country ( &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The same is true for Hou Hsiao-hsien&lt;/span>;). The advantage of doing this is that it will not be affected by certain policies in Taiwan. The disadvantage is that it will distance you from reality and indulge in memories. Suspicion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Actually, Hou Hsiao-hsien is not my film inspiration. In 2015, I finally watched Hou Hsiao-hsien&#39;s movie &quot;The Assassin&quot; on the big screen in mainland China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I wrote a paragraph after watching the movie:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;&quot;The Assassin Nie Yinniang&quot; does not tell how Nie Yinniang became an assassin, but how she did not become an assassin. First of all, the camera sets the atmosphere .When many directors take pictures of a group of talking people, Hou Hsiao-hsien pays attention to the people standing in the corner. He is behind the camera and does not lead us to see anything. Instead, he follows the movement of the camera to feel what is hidden inside. , there is always a pair of eyes lingering near the speaker.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, news came out that the director was suffering from Alzheimer&#39;s disease, and his family confirmed that he had fully returned to family life and was recuperating. In fact, there have been rumors in the circle about Director Hou suffering from dementia for several years. I think it&#39;s boring to say that a director like him has &quot;retired&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Acheng wrote about a scene in an article. He said that there was originally a braid-cutting scene in &quot;A Dream of Life&quot;, which required more than a hundred braids to be cut off at once. In one shot, it could only be filmed. once. Everyone was very nervous during the filming. As a result, the camera of a female reporter flashed as soon as the braid was cut. Everyone immediately looked at the little girl. No one dared to speak. The little girl was so frightened that she cried. Hou Hsiao-hsien said nothing. &quot;Anyway, the shot was in vain, so there&#39;s no way we can shoot it again.&quot; This quote comes from cinematographer Yao Hongyi, who has worked with Director Hou for many years. In fact, it quite reflects Hou Hsiao-hsien&#39;s attitude towards movies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, there have been news from time to time about Hou Hsiao-hsien&#39;s new film &quot;Searching for the River God&quot;, but I think it may not be seen. If you can’t see it, it doesn’t matter. He likes to say to young people who make movies: &quot;You can&#39;t escape what kind of person you are when you make whatever you want!&quot; In one of his movies, the young man, regardless of what kind of person he is, shot the movie under prohibited circumstances. A group of young people rode motorcycles and passed by the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, leaving him far behind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/SbJLfSLKF8mdame1OTbhxi33amRDigs5TW8L3lWS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/SbJLfSLKF8mdame1OTbhxi33amRDigs5TW8L3lWS.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256540&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many years In the future, when I revisit these vivid and somewhat joyful movie scenes, I will feel a kind of gratitude that is difficult for others to understand. There are already so many works by Director Hou that can be watched over and over again, isn’t that enough? It just so happens that this last film has a meaningful name - &quot;River God&quot; may refer to himself. Therefore, some people speculate that this movie may be done by the descendants he has trained for many years... This is because it is too unclear what kind of person Hou Hsiao-hsien is. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Starting from &quot;The Man from Fenggui&quot; in 1983, Hou Hsiao-hsien became more and more isolated on his path until &quot;The Assassin&quot; won the award at the Cannes Film Festival in 2015. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the movie road, such people are almost extinct. What does such a person look like? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even though he could blend in, he could keep up with the new era, he could incite young people...he didn&#39;t have any of it. I am reminded here of a quote by Truffaut: “If my films contradict the times in which I live, as I am sometimes accused of doing, it is perhaps because I sympathize with those who have to struggle to enter a world from which they are excluded. People of the world.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The confused young filmmakers will come to their senses sooner or later. The existence of Hou Hsiao-hsien means an &quot;ecology&quot;. There is at least a gap left in the world of movies, which is much more important than countless specific movies. The bigger the bubble, the more likely it will burst; no matter how weak the hope is, it is still hope. Maybe I&#39;m pessimistic, but sometimes optimism can be deceptive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if his friend Edward Yang was still alive, even if the new movies were still a hit, and even if art films finally opened up a market of their own, Hou Hsiao-hsien might have said: &quot;There is no one like him.&quot; He had already seen clearly that All true artists, in the end, will not be able to have anyone around them - at that time, they will become &quot;everyone&quot;, the so-called &quot;see themselves, see the world, and see all living beings&quot;. There is no escaping this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[盲人“看”世界]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259957]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-04 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;According to relevant data from the China Blind Association, there are approximately 17.3 million blind people in our country.

This is not a problem with the actors, but with the party planning. , the game session was a mess. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From the earlier TV series &quot;Chen Qing Ling&quot; and &quot;Shan He Ling&quot; to the recent &quot;Lotus Tower&quot; and &quot;Sauvignon Blanc&quot;, after-sales concerts have become more and more common. It has also become a new way for the platform to make money - how did the after-sales concerts become a trend? How profitable is it? What is the risk of rollover? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/fiWgxYqvKNZUfpp1H9Ub1xSPXFZE9m7IZiAkH5RK.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;711&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/fiWgxYqvKNZUfpp1H9Ub1xSPXFZE9m7IZiAkH5RK.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256321&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stills of &quot;Sauvignon Blanc&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;After-sales concerts are becoming more and more popular&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In an era where video websites are competing for hegemony, more and more attention is paid to the &quot;after-sales&quot; of drama series. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A drama is not finished after it is aired. If we can provide drama fans with better after-sales service and experience, we can take out more from the fans&#39; pockets. More money can also increase the loyalty of drama fans to the platform, which will help increase the value of platform members. Therefore, after-sales services in the form of after-sales concerts, after-sales parties, after-sales sharing sessions, etc. are becoming more and more popular. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After-sales concerts are generally broadcast simultaneously online and offline. Offline tickets need to be purchased at a high price, or only by purchasing a platform membership card can you get the chance to draw tickets. Online live broadcasts require the purchase of live broadcast tickets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the concert, the main creators gathered together to sing theme songs, restore famous scenes, and play interactive games, which formed the main content of the concert. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The trend of after-sales concerts was first sparked by the 2019 &quot;Chen Qing Ling&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the series ended, the platform held two Chinese-style concerts in Nanjing, selling more than 16,000 tickets in six price ranges from 627 yuan to 1,980 yuan5 It was sold out within seconds. If you didn’t grab the ticket, you can still buy the platform’s online live broadcast tickets at prices ranging from 25 yuan to 50 yuan. &quot;Chen Qing Ling&quot; successfully tested the waters, allowing the industry to see the huge market space for after-sales concerts of popular dramas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2020, the fairy tale drama &quot;Liu Li&quot; became a dark horse in the summer season and gained many loyal fans. Since it is impossible to gather offline due to the epidemic, the platform has customized a cloud singing party for drama fans. Audiences can pay to watch it at prices ranging from 25 yuan (member price) to 50 yuan (non-member price). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The 2021 hit drama &quot;Shanhe Ling&quot; has replicated the amazing popularity of the &quot;Chen Qing Ling&quot; after-sales concert. There were two consecutive concerts in Suzhou, with the highest ticket price reaching 2,280 yuan (more expensive than a ticket for a first-line singer&#39;s concert). 600,000 people bought tickets online, and it took 14 seconds to sell out. Online live broadcast tickets also cost 68 yuan each. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Afterwards, with the official crackdown on chaos in the entertainment industry, the format of after-sales concerts for popular dramas stopped for a while. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This summer, an improved version of after-sales concerts will return. However, both &quot;Lotus Tower&quot; and &quot;Sauvignon Blanc&quot; have significantly reduced the number of offline audiences, with only a few hundred people offline. This can make the approval of performances more efficient, and can also avoid some uncontrollable chaos in the entertainment industry, and avoid Public criticism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Offline tickets are exclusive to high-level members. Only those who have purchased a one-year membership will have the chance to win the lottery. Online viewers can choose to pay to purchase live broadcast viewing tickets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/wsYEwtIPBpAFe4Kt5CzoPTYnxdgouKD5nps7OgrP.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;607&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/wsYEwtIPBpAFe4Kt5CzoPTYnxdgouKD5nps7OgrP.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256320&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stills from &quot;Lotus Tower&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;The money from drama fans is really good&lt; /strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The after-sales concert is really a &quot;charity&quot; for the platform. Is it going to give back to the fans of the drama and provide benefits to the fans of the drama? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Obviously not that simple. If it is really a benefit, then should online viewing be free? It may be true that the platform gives back to drama fans, but it must be true that it makes another wave of money from drama fans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Chen Qing Ling&quot; has verified how strong the purchasing power of drama fans is. A single offline ticket for &quot;Chen Qing Ling&quot; was sold to 150,000 by scalpers; online VIP tickets are 30 yuan/ticket, non-VIP tickets are 50 yuan/ticket, and group tickets are 25 yuan/ticket. The total number of people in the live concert room exceeds 3.2 million. If Based on an average of 30 yuan per person, the total online revenue is nearly 100 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Not only are the offline tickets for &quot;Ling of Mountains and Rivers&quot; more expensive than those of &quot;Chen Qing Ling&quot;, but the price of online live broadcast tickets is as high as 68 yuan per piece, but at no point It did not affect the enthusiasm of fans of the drama. The Douban score of &quot;Shan He Ling Born Bosom Friend Concert&quot; is as high as 9.5 points, which shows that fans of the drama are very happy with their money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Lotus Tower&quot; has changed to a new format. Even if the number of offline concert tickets is limited, they are basically not sold to the outside world. Buying members and drawing tickets can also It provides a great boost to the platform’s membership fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Drama fans need to purchase a 448 yuan/year Star Diamond membership (or membership level V7) to get 1 chance to draw tickets, and the number of times they purchase a Star Diamond membership Unrestricted. In order to be able to draw tickets, some fans of the drama bought a 10-year Star Diamond membership in one go. The membership fee also costs 4,480 yuan, which is more expensive than offline concert tickets, and they may not be able to win the lottery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Sauvignon Blanc&quot; is also played in a similar way. Users who purchase the SVIP annual card of the platform can get 10 lottery opportunities, and the annual card price is 488 yuan. The platform limits the number of recharges for the SVIP annual card, which can only be recharged a maximum of 3 times. This avoids excessive consumption by fans and can also increase users’ enthusiasm for paying for prize draws. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In short, there are always ways to make money when the platform holds after-sales concerts. In the short term, you can directly collect money from fans of the drama. In the long term, after-sales concerts will become part of the platform’s membership services. If there is a second season like &quot;Sauvignon Blanc&quot;, it can also build momentum for the second season. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Main actors who have starred in hit dramas will basically attend after-sales concerts. This helps extend the character&#39;s popularity to the actors. What&#39;s more, if other main creators are participating, a single leading actor may be accused of being &quot;insincere&quot; by fans of the drama, and may be &quot;out of touch&quot; or &quot;back-stepped&quot;. . Therefore, as long as most of the core creators agree to hold an after-sales concert, the remaining starring actors will only have the option of &quot;agree&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;It pays to fool drama fans&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Due to character filtering Mirror, drama fans are very tolerant of after-sales concerts. For example, if the actor is not a professional singer, they do not require him to sing well. Drama fans generally have a request, hoping to see traces of the characters in the interactions of the actors, so that the beautiful emotions in the drama can continue offline, and the regrets in the drama can be made up for offline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This puts forward high requirements for the restoration and interaction of after-sales concerts - this is why many after-sales concerts have actors wearing costumes from the drama Costumes are used in performances to give drama fans a stronger sense of immersion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Lotus Tower&quot; is like this, with a high degree of restoration, full of sincerity, and has been well received. Although &quot;Sauvignon Blanc&quot; received many bad reviews, the restoration of the Qingshui Town part of the play became a highlight of the concert. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Once the degree of restoration is poor and the interactivity is insufficient, the after-sales concert will instead make the audience laugh and let the audience &quot;get out of the trap&quot;. The previous Cloud Song Concert of &quot;Liu Li&quot; shocked drama fans because the male and female protagonists had almost no interaction on stage. The Douban score of &quot;Liu Li Finale Cloud Song Concert&quot; was as low as 2.4 points. As soon as the after-sales concert ended, the actor dropped a few points. Thousands of fans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This time the &quot;Sauvignon Blanc&quot; after-sales concert was criticized, it was not the actor&#39;s problem. Yang Zi&#39;s emotion for the character is still very touching. Tan Jianci was late because of a traffic jam. When he arrived, he sang, danced and adjusted the atmosphere. He was very dedicated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The problem mainly lies in the planning of the concert, such as asking the five main actors to pose strange poses in front of the flower arrangements, having Zhang Wanyi recite, and having Deng Wei Cooking, and having Yang Zi and Dai Luwa wearing high heels recreate the fighting scenes in the play... there was little restoration, and the interaction was awkward. It was originally intended to build momentum for the second season, but it actually caused some fans of the show to leave disappointed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After-sales concerts seem to be very profitable, but planning them well is not easy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When the characters in the play are like each other, the offline actors may not be familiar with each other in reality. This requires efforts in planning and in the early stages. Coordinate and communicate more with the actors. For example, you can let the actors wear costumes to continue &quot;performing&quot; in the play, or you can use interesting game designs to allow the actors to have more interactions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is foreseeable that after-sales concerts of &quot;small scale offline, money to watch online&quot; will become a new normal for hit dramas in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Drama fans are willing to spend money to &quot;buy benefits&quot;. However, it is worth noting that if the platform is fooled and really treats drama fans as &quot;leeks&quot;, it will It will damage the credibility of the platform and also have a negative impact on the actors. When the platform wants to organize after-sales services, actors may not participate, members are unwilling to pay, and the platform has completely lost a way to make money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[刘家昌自曝家丑为哪般？“先小人后君子”才能财产婚姻两全丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259969]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-04 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On October 26 and November 1, 2023, the famous musician Liu Jiachang published two long articles in succession Accusing his ex-wife Zhen Zhen attracted public attention. Liu&#39;s first long article elaborated on his version of the inside story of the &quot;mother and son fighting for the birth&quot; of his ex-wife and their son, while the second long article accused Zhen Zhen of being incompetent in raising her son and &quot;being a shameless mother.&quot; After Liu Jiachang published his first long article, Zhen Zhen also published a thousand-word article to counterattack, and the two of them were &quot;at odds with each other&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Weibo promotion&quot; triggered by celebrities&#39; &quot;divorce essays&quot; once again occupied the hot search, and showed a similar plot to similar incidents in the past: one party took the lead in attacking, and looked eloquent. The words are righteous and well-founded; the other party fights back and refutes point by point, which seems to be righteous and sensible. For a time, public opinion was greatly divided. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Jiachang’s main accusation against Zhen Zhen can be divided into two parts. The first is the issue of division of marital property. Liu Jiachang accused Zhenzhen of transferring Liu&#39;s assets to her name in various ways over the years, including but not limited to company equity, music copyrights and cash income; the second was the issue of his son&#39;s education and growth. Liu accused Zhen Zhen of controlling his son but failing to teach him how to spoil him. He made his son drop out of school again and again and became naughty. He got into troubles including drunkenness, racing, beating people, and soliciting prostitutes. Liu tried his best to encourage his son to make music, but failed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To sum up, Liu Jiachang claimed that he &quot;disclosed his family affairs&quot; because of his failed marriage and hurt feelings. He posted a long article accusing Zhenzhen mother and son just to vent his anger so as not to &quot;die unjustly&quot;. It seems inappropriate. It was all about fighting for property, because he also promised to donate his property to charity if he won the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding Liu’s first long article, Zhen Zhen also issued a counterattack, accusing Liu Jiachang of being addicted to gambling and suppressing his son. It was Liu Jiachang who stole his property, not the other way around; Liu Jiachang After the second long article was released, Zhen Zhen also criticized Liu Jiachang for slandering herself and her son, saying, &quot;It&#39;s really shameless.&quot; Their son Zhang Liheng (formerly known as Liu Ziqian) also supported his mother on social media. The &quot;mutual conflict&quot; between the two sides shows that each has his own words, but in order to determine which is right and which is wrong, we should return to the level of facts and legal principles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the property dispute between the two parties, there are many factual issues that are not difficult to prove or falsify. Written evidence can be used to determine whether these properties were earned by Liu Jiachang, or whether they were simply &quot;registered in the name of his wife Zhenzhen&quot; as joint property of the couple. For example, the audit report mentioned by Liu Jiachang, and the Income details, tax return records, property registration records from the three places across the Taiwan Strait and the United States, as well as legal documents regarding music copyrights, company equity, real estate ownership, and the agreements between the two parties regarding the property, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhen Zhen accused Liu Jiachang of being &quot;addicted to gambling&quot;, and Liu Jiachang responded that &quot;he only used his own money for gambling.&quot; Liu Jiachang accused Zhen Zhen of &quot;not filming for forty years&quot; and that all the joint property was earned by herself. Zhen Zhen also personally told the media that every penny earned by Liu was given to Zhen Zhen and her family. It&#39;s not difficult to prove. Liu&#39;s accusation and response can be summarized as, &quot;It is normal for a husband to make money outside and leave it to his wife to take care of, but Zhen Zhen should not assume that she earned all the money.&quot; Whether this argument can be established is the key issue in determining whether the dispute is right or wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second part of Liu Jiachang’s accusation, “Unvirtuous wife and unfilial son,” is even more difficult to verify because of its rich details and specific descriptions. Liu Wen accused Zhen Zhen of failing to teach her son well and his son was naughty and naughty. He was forced to drop out of school in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and the United States. He also got into troubles including drunkenness, beating people, speed driving, and soliciting prostitutes. Zhen Zhen even &quot;solicited prostitutes on behalf of her son.&quot; , these are specific and severe public accusations. Liu Jiachang should be responsible for providing evidence and ensuring the authenticity of the accusations, otherwise it will be suspected of slander. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Jiachang also revealed in the long article that his son was able to successfully enroll in school or escape punishment many times by relying on his connections with &quot;big men&quot; such as Run Run Shaw. If these incidents really happened, there must be others. There are too many informed third parties who can verify one by one, and it does not rule out that there are still many cases that can be verified. Liu Jiachang also mentioned that he tried his best to help his son make music but failed. This can also be supported by the record company and related people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a legal perspective, it is meaningless for both parties to resort to personal attacks in moral trials. The focus should still be on the common property division issues in divorce proceedings. Both parties accuse each other of embezzling their own property. This should be left to professional lawyers who specialize in marriage law and company law to litigate the game. Everything should be carried out according to normal litigation procedures; Zhen Zhen said that the two parties had divorced in the United States in 1987, and Liu Jiachang said It is said that the divorce was filed in Hong Kong in 2015. The truth needs to be determined by courts in many places and even many countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whose essay should the public believe? This still requires facts as the basis and law as the criterion in order to arrive at a fairer judgment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The divorce dispute between Liu Jiachang and Zhen Zhen has actually been going on for many years. The reason why old matters have resurfaced is because of the property division disputes arising from the divorce, as well as the huge interest entanglement mixed with the relationship between parent and child. Even an ordinary couple will have similar &quot;Rashomon&quot; problems during divorce disputes, let alone a celebrity couple who need to divide huge amounts of property and have huge conflicts of interest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from Liu Jiachang&#39;s accusations, he is quite resentful of &quot;having his feelings hurt by money&quot; and resentment of &quot;having money hurt because of his feelings.&quot; The impression between the lines is that he was originally He is an &quot;old-school face-saving person&quot; who follows the traditional Chinese marriage and family values ​​of &quot;men taking care of the outside and women taking care of the house&quot;, but he is exhausted physically and mentally by his wife&#39;s deliberate &quot;marriage competition&quot;. The reason why their marriage failed was that they fell into a vicious cycle of &quot;talking about feelings hurts money, talking about money hurts feelings&quot;. Unclear financial decisions and inadequate marriage and love decisions were also important factors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Comparing many cases of &quot;peaceful breakup&quot; and &quot;mutual divorce&quot; between celebrity couples, it can be seen that the key to the success of &quot;peaceful breakup&quot; is that both parties have fully completed the notarization of pre-marital property and the division of post-marital property. Procedure, the method of &quot;first being a villain and then being a gentleman&quot; is equivalent to &quot;pursuing common feelings with common interests&quot; rather than &quot;seeking interests in the name of feelings&quot;. Before marriage, clarify the distribution of property and custody rights in the event of divorce. In the end, the respective interests of both parties are better protected, and they will not be reduced to online battles with short essays. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is said that the merger of two well-off houses in first-tier cities is like the merger of two companies, and there will be problems in the distribution of large amounts of property. It is best to divide the property before marriage to effectively avoid possible disputes. In comparison, celebrity marriages involve huge amounts of property. Before getting married, they should agree on how to divide property and child custody rights in the event of a breakup. Otherwise, they will inevitably fall into a &quot;complaint dispute&quot;. This time Liu Jiachang and Zhen Zhen were at odds with each other, which once again proved this point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[环状RNA有望成为下一代重磅药物]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259706]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-04 15:15:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;For the invention of mRNA vaccine technology, American scientists Katalin Karikó and Drew Wei Drew Weissman won the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The mRNA vaccine has not only saved millions of people around the world from being killed by the new coronavirus, but has also brought tens of billions of dollars in revenue to institutions and scientists engaged in vaccine development and production. This has drawn much attention to RNA, an unstable small nucleic acid molecule. Scientists and medical research and development institutions are working hard to develop new RNA drugs, and circular RNA is expected to become the next generation of blockbuster RNA drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/PeKYI0DjhC680SKp0veP23hYpVIlP2zwrilYSNFF.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1248&quot; height= &quot;814&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/PeKYI0DjhC680SKp0veP23hYpVIlP2zwrilYSNFF.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256317&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Circular RNA therapy is gaining more and more attention. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Nature website/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;What is circular RNA&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Each The DNA molecule of a gene generally contains several exon sequences, separated by introns. It must first be transcribed into a single-stranded precursor mRNA. After shearing by shearing enzyme, the intron part is cut out, and then the exon part is cut out. The exons are spliced ​​together to form a functional mRNA, which then binds to the ribosome and guides it to synthesize proteins. Therefore, mRNA is a &quot;reduced version&quot; of the gene&#39;s DNA molecule, carrying the complete genetic information of the gene in the most streamlined nucleotides. The reason why mRNA can be used as a vaccine is that it can directly instruct cells to synthesize the corresponding antigen proteins, thereby triggering the body&#39;s immune system to produce antibodies to fight the virus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the mRNA vaccine had a bumpy road before encountering the new coronavirus, and it was basically ignored. As a result, Carrico was unable to receive funding, and was transferred, reduced, or even fired from his job many times. Compared with double-stranded DNA molecules of genes, mRNA molecules have a simple structure and are extremely unstable. They generally have a single-stranded linear structure and are easily broken down by RNase. Therefore, the half-life of mRNA in the body is usually only a few hours. Such a short survival time is enough for vaccines, because the mRNA can immediately guide the cells to synthesize antigen proteins after entering the cells. However, for diseases such as cancer, neurological diseases, and genetic diseases that require large amounts of continuous protein treatment, the RNA persists in the body. time is too short. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Interestingly, RNase mainly &quot;bullies&quot; linear RNA, but has no way of attacking circular RNA. In fact, scientists have discovered that there is a kind of RNA in living organisms that can be connected end to end and likes to circle around itself more than 40 years ago. Through the continuous efforts of scientists, this circular RNA has recently begun to show great medical uses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1976, Swiss virologist Daniel Kola Kofsky and a German research team discovered circular RNAs in mouse and plant viruses respectively. Circular forms are present in viruses, but have not attracted enough attention. In the early 1990s, researchers discovered such circular RNA molecules in human and other mammalian cells and proved that these circular RNAs are the transcript products of certain genes. Later, scientists discovered that circular RNA exists in almost all living things. However, compared with linear RNA, most circular RNA splicing is often chaotic and cannot guide cells to synthesize the corresponding proteins. It is also unclear what the purpose of circular RNA is. In the first thirty years after the discovery of circular RNA, , people have always mistaken it as the product of incorrect splicing during gene transcription, so it has not attracted much attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the development of RNA sequencing technology, scientists have discovered that circular RNA is very abundant in mammalian cells, highly conserved, far more stable than linear RNA, and plays many functions, and is not dispensable &quot;junk&quot; . Research shows that more than 60% of human genes can produce both circular and linear transcripts. Currently, more than 100,000 types of circular RNA have been discovered in human cells, which is much higher than the number of known human genes (about 20,000). ). Because it is not susceptible to RNase degradation, in some cells, the half-life of natural circRNA can be 2-4 times that of linear RNA, or even longer, while synthetic circRNA can survive in cells for several days, and The abundance of circular RNA in cells can reach more than 10 times that of linear RNA of related genes. Scientists have also discovered that endogenous circRNAs are involved in a variety of biological functions, including gene transcription, protein translation, immune response, cell proliferation and physiological regulation of tumorigenesis, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most circular RNAs lack the necessary structure for ribosome recognition and are generally non-coding, that is, they cannot translate proteins. However, there are also a few that are coding RNAs, and these encoded proteins can also function. normal functionality. In 1995, researchers at the University of Colorado Health Science Center realized the coding function of circular RNA in vitro for the first time. Adding an internal ribosome entry site was crucial. This also laid the foundation for the development of circular RNA as vaccines and protein drugs. . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Technological breakthroughs bring hope&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Since most natural circular RNAs cannot encode proteins and must be artificially designed and synthesized, scientists have Circular RNA technology has undergone a series of improvements and improvements, and has achieved a series of major breakthroughs. For example, in July 2022, the research team of Howard Y. Chang at Stanford University published an important study in the journal Nature Biotechnology. They made a series of improvements to the structure of circular RNA and optimized the translation process. Modules such as the initiation region, termination region, and internal ribosome entry site are implemented, and modular assembly is achieved, making protein translation easier to initiate and more efficient. Compared with unmodified circRNA, the recombinant protein expression level of modified circRNA can be increased hundreds of times. In vivo experiments in mice have shown that circRNA can be maintained in cells for more than 7 days, and only a small amount of circRNA molecules are needed to maintain high protein levels in cells for a longer period of time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other major technological breakthroughs include: adding complementary sequences at both ends and in the middle of RNA to allow RNA to automatically form a loop and be more stable; allowing circular RNA to carry longer nucleotide chains, such as more than 12,000 nucleotide dystrophin gene sequence to synthesize more complex proteins; optimize circRNA delivery systems, such as lentivirus or exosome systems, to efficiently deliver circRNA to target cells; use genetic engineering technology Prepare circRNA on a large scale to save a lot of cost and time in circRNA preparation, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to technological improvements, the potential application of circular RNA in the medical field is another research hotspot. In March 2022, Peking University Wei Wensheng&#39;s team published a paper in the journal Cell confirming that compared with linear mRNA vaccines, circular RNA vaccines can induce more neutralizing antibodies and more effective T Cellular response. In May 2023, Zhang Yuanhao&#39;s team at Stanford University published an article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences proving that circRNA has the potential to be developed into anti-viral and anti-tumor vaccines. They used circRNA prepared in vitro (can encode viral protein antigens) Immunization of mice induces innate activation of dendritic cells, stimulating robust antigen-specific CD8 T cell responses in lymph nodes and tissues. Immunity experiments in mice showed that circular RNA designed for melanoma could significantly inhibit tumor growth in mice compared with untreated mice. This indicates that circRNA can be used as a therapeutic vaccine to induce strong cellular immunity and eliminate tumors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with linear mRNA products, circular RNA products have several major advantages. First, circular RNA is more stable and easier to store than linear mRNA. This is because of its structural characteristics, linear mRNA is easy to transport It is degraded by RNase during storage, delivery, etc., so it must be cryopreserved and cold-chain transported. Even if linear mRNA is subjected to a series of modifications such as nucleotide modification, the cost and effect are still not ideal, while circular RNA can be It can be stored at room temperature for about a month and can be frozen and thawed repeatedly. Secondly, circRNA is safer than linear RNA. Research shows that natural circRNA molecules show lower immunogenicity and cytotoxicity. Thirdly, circRNA is safer than linear RNA. RNA-like RNA has the ability to produce prolonged antigens and can induce a long-lasting immune response in the body, thus promoting the production of more antibodies and longer-lasting immune protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, circRNA products are expected to become a better choice in the field of RNA therapy for various refractory diseases such as viral infections, tumors, pathogenic bacterial infections, autoimmune diseases, metabolic diseases, etc. play a greater role in disease prevention and treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Has received huge investments&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Inspired by the great success of mRNA vaccines, some scientists around the world who are engaged in pioneering research on circRNA have also established a number of A circular RNA company was founded, and it quickly became favored and sought after by capital. Some biopharmaceutical giants have also joined the trend of developing circular RNA pharmaceutical products, hoping to take the initiative in future competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Daniel Anderson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and others founded Orna Therapeutics in 2019. The company’s pipeline products mainly include anti-tumor and anti-infection drugs. and circular RNA therapies for the treatment of genetic diseases, but they are all in the early stages of development. The company plans to launch the first clinical trial in 2024. In February 2021 and August 2022, Orna completed Series A and Series B financing of US$80 million and US$220 million respectively. Merck, a pharmaceutical giant with a history of 130 years, seems to be very optimistic about this startup. It has paid an advance payment of US$150 million and plans to jointly develop circular RNA therapies for infectious diseases with Orna Company, while injecting US$100 million to participate. Received Orna’s Series B financing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Laronde was founded by Flagship Pioneering with an investment of US$50 million on May 11, 2021. It received US$440 million in financing three months later, making it the largest environmental investment company so far. This is the largest financing ever received by an RNA company. Since the flagship Pioneer Company once incubated the RNA vaccine star company Moderna of the United States, Lloyd&#39;s Company is also known as &quot;Modena 2.0&quot;. After receiving huge financing, the company is focusing on preventive and therapeutic circular RNA product development and clinical trials. However, on June 12, 2023, a joint investigation report released by the Boston Globe and STAT showed that the company was suspected of falsifying preclinical experimental data. For example, the circular RNA it developed for weight loss drugs only worked in mice. Expression, but not in monkeys. In a subsequent statement, the company also admitted the data fraud designed in the above report and dealt with the relevant responsible persons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yuanhao Zhang of MIT founded Orbital Therapeutics in September 2022 with Drew Weisman, pioneer of mRNA vaccine technology and winner of the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, and others. ) company, which completed a Series A financing of up to US$270 million in April 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China also has a number of start-up companies developing circRNA drugs. Circode Bio was founded in September 2018 by researcher Wang Zefeng of the Max Planck Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and others. It is the world&#39;s first start-up company to develop nucleic acid drugs based on circular RNA. In December 2021, Huanma Biotech completed Pre-A round financing of more than 20 million US dollars, and in August 2023, it completed another tens of millions of US dollars in Series A financing. At present, the company has reached a research and development cooperation agreement with the American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer to jointly develop circular RNA therapies. Yuanyin Biotech was founded by Professor Wei Wensheng of Peking University and others in April 2021. In June 2022, it successfully completed a Series A financing of more than 280 million yuan. Together with the angel round and Pre-A round of financing, the company has accumulated more than 400 million yuan. The company&#39;s R&amp;D pipeline includes circRNA products for the treatment of infectious diseases, metabolic diseases and tumors. Among them, the fastest-growing product is the circRNA COVID-19 vaccine, which has completed preclinical trials and entered clinical trials. However, due to the global COVID-19 The epidemic has calmed down, and it is expected that the development of the new crown vaccine may be shelved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, overall, the current research on circRNA therapy has just begun. To achieve what one start-up company predicts, circRNA will start a revolution or achieve 100 therapeutic goals within ten years. The promise of a new drug project still has a long way to go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 15:25:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[又见哄抢，还要纵容？？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259965]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-04 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, Chinese medicinal materials grown by a farmer in Huaiyang District, Zhoukou City, Henan Province were robbed by local villagers, once again causing Internet extremes Big attention. Not long ago, there was an incident of villagers robbing corn in the city. On a wider scale, such incidents of theft and robbery of large growers are common on the Internet. This is closely related to the fact that the place where the incident occurred deliberately downplayed the illegal nature of the villagers&#39; looting and condoned the villagers&#39; infringement of the rights and interests of agricultural investors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the robbery of Chinese medicinal materials in Zhoukou attracted attention, the Huaiyang District Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau issued a situation report on November 1, saying that the incident was not a robbery, but the villagers &quot;mistakenly believed&quot; that the growers had harvested for the second time. After finishing, he went into the field to pick up medicinal materials. The growers called the police after trying to dissuade them to no avail. The police quickly arrived at the scene and &quot;persuaded&quot; the people to leave. The report also said that after the second harvest of medicinal materials is completed, it is &quot;a habit for many years&quot; for growers to allow villagers to pick up leftover medicinal materials in the fields. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Pick up&quot;, &quot;years of habit&quot; and &quot;mistake&quot; are cliches that can be seen in almost every incident where growers are robbed. Half a month ago, after the corn robbery incident in Dancheng County, Zhoukou City, the local Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau responded that &quot;people went to harvested plots to pick up corn.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These excuses are really ridiculous. Even if there is a local habit of &quot;picking up&quot;, even if the growers allow the villagers to pick up after the second harvest is completed, the growers have repeatedly blocked the looting. If the farmers turn a blind eye and don&#39;t hear, is this still &quot;allowed&quot; by the growers? Is this still legal &quot;picking&quot;? In the Dancheng County corn robbery incident, hundreds of villagers also ignored the growers&#39; obstruction and ran to the unharvested plots in front of the harvesters to &quot;pick up&quot; them, forcing the harvesters to stop working to avoid accidental injuries. Is this still traditional &quot;picking up&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the case of Gushi County public officials driving patrol cars to steal sorghum, the growers had not yet harvested the sorghum. This cannot be excused by &quot;picking up&quot;, right? But in the eyes of some local people, cutting a few ears of sorghum is not a big deal. &quot;Rural people just like to take advantage of themselves.&quot; Patrols are arranged to avoid safety accidents, not to stop theft. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When local officials faced the looting incident, they not only downplayed it in words and justified large-scale looting, but also in action. Whether it was the robbery of Chinese medicinal materials in Huaiyang or the robbery of corn in Dancheng, after the growers called the police and reported it to the government, the police arrived only to &quot;maintain order&quot; and &quot;persuade&quot; the villagers to leave. What order should be maintained? Do we still need the police to maintain order and escort during looting? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to characterize looting behavior? Article 268 of the Criminal Law stipulates that if a crowd is gathered to rob public or private property, the amount is relatively large or there are other serious circumstances, the ringleaders and active participants shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention or surveillance, and shall also be fined; if the amount is huge or there are other special circumstances, If the circumstances are serious, the offender shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years but not more than ten years, and shall also be fined. The standards for relatively large amounts and huge amounts shall be determined by each high court. According to the standards of the Shanghai High Court, robbery of property worth more than 4,000 yuan is considered a &quot;large amount&quot;, and more than 40,000 yuan is a &quot;huge amount.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The crime of gathering a crowd to rob property will only punish ringleaders and active participants. For ordinary participants, if they cannot be convicted, administrative penalties can also be imposed. The Public Security Administration Punishment Law stipulates that those who rob public or private property shall be detained for not less than five days but not more than ten days, and may also be fined not more than five hundred yuan; if the circumstances are serious, they shall be detained for not less than ten days but not more than fifteen days, and may also be fined not more than five hundred yuan. the following fines. For those who do not rob but steal, the provisions of the Criminal Law and the Public Security Administration Punishment Law on theft can be applied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in reality, the police often give a wide berth to these acts of robbery and theft. A few years ago, a melon farmer in Zhejiang had all 30,000 kilograms of watermelons stolen overnight. After investigation, the police determined that the melon pickers had mistakenly believed the rumor that &quot;the melon grower didn&#39;t want them any more.&quot; There was no theft. Based on the subjective intention, it was determined that it did not constitute theft, but was just a &quot;civil dispute&quot;, and the melon farmers were required to claim compensation through civil procedures. The watermelons grown by a melon farmer in Xi&#39;an, Shaanxi Province were also robbed by villagers. The village branch secretary said that the villagers &quot;believed the rumors.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If &quot;listening to rumors&quot; can be a reason for acquittal, then there is no illegal crime. If you want to steal something, just spread some &quot;rumors&quot;, and then you can steal it without hesitation. Is there such a ridiculous thing in the world? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people defended the villagers on the grounds that the local farmers were old and helpless and had no means of living. These reasons are also untenable. Even if you encounter difficulties in your own life, you should go to the government to report the problem instead of grabbing other people&#39;s property. In fact, these excuses are completely imaginary excuses. Most of the villagers who participated in the looting were not in a state of poverty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, similar incidents of robbery and theft have occurred frequently in many places. It must be said that they are related to the shielding, excuse and connivance of the local government and local police. After the incident, the local government only &quot;persuaded&quot; those who participated in the looting to hand back the looted property without punishing them. Even if some people refused to hand it back, nothing would happen. Of course, the robber will not stop, he will continue to rob next time, and he will not hand it back again. On the contrary, if after an incident, the relevant departments punish decisively, detain when they should be detained, sentence when they should be sentenced, and kill the chicken to scare the monkey, will anyone dare to rob it in the future? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2014, in Zhangzhou, Fujian, fish farmers from other places were robbed of fish by local villagers. The local police promptly filed a case and detained three villagers who participated in serious fish robbery and urged others to do so. The participating villagers &quot;surrendered&quot; and &quot;returned the stolen goods.&quot; Clearly declaring that looting is illegal and subject to legal penalties, and that the items stolen are &quot;stolen goods&quot; and must be returned, is the correct way to deal with this type of looting. Only in this way can we establish and maintain a good local business environment, attract more agricultural investment, and revitalize the countryside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 15:25:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中国工商银行原副行长张红力接受审查调查]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259971]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-04 15:08:23&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>; Zhang Hongli, former member of the Party Committee and Vice President of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, is suspected of serious violations of discipline and law and is currently under investigation by the Central Committee Disciplinary review and supervisory investigation by the National Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 15:25:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[秋季以来持续偏暖影响几何？会是暖冬吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259961]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-04 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Since this autumn, temperatures have continued to be high in most parts of my country, and winter has been delayed in many places. Many members of the public have questions: Will this year be a mild winter? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At a press conference held by the China Meteorological Administration on the 3rd, Jia Xiaolong, deputy director of the National Climate Center, introduced that the national average temperature in October was 12.2°C, 1.6°C higher than the same period in normal years, and the highest temperature in the same period since 1961. Highest. Most of Northeast China, most of Shandong, most of Inner Mongolia, most of Xinjiang and other places were 2°C to 4°C higher. The temperatures in Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Tianjin and Liaoning were all the highest for the same period in history. The daily highest temperatures at 140 national weather stations exceeded October’s historical extreme value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Since this autumn, the mid-to-high latitudes of Eurasia have been dominated by zonal circulation. my country has been controlled by positive anomalies in the height field. The intensity of the Siberian High has been generally weak, and cold air activity has been weak, resulting in persistent temperatures in most parts of my country. It’s on the high side,” Jia Xiaolong said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Experts said that high temperatures and weak cold air will have a certain impact on the development of fog and haze weather and agricultural production. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, fog and haze weather has occurred in Huanghuai and other places in North China. Zhang Jiancheng, deputy director of the National Meteorological Center, analyzed that the main reason is that the zonal circulation has been dominated over North China recently and the cold air is weak. North China, Huanghuai and other places are located in the weak pressure field behind the high pressure, and southerly winds have prevailed for a long time. At the same time, accompanied by high humidity atmosphere, vertical temperature inversion structure and special topographic effects of the Taihang Mountains and Yanshan Mountains, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region has continued to Severe fog and haze weather. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although winter has already begun in most of Northeast China, northwestern North China, and most of northwest China, the onset of winter in most of the above-mentioned areas is later than normal, and in some areas it is more than 5 days later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jia Xiaolong said that warm and hot weather may lead to low soil moisture, affecting crop emergence and growth, which is not conducive to spring plowing and sowing in the coming year; delaying winter may affect crop growth seasons and cycles, which is not conducive to agricultural production plans and Yield; warm and hot climates can easily lead to excessive growth of crops and are conducive to the overwintering and reproduction of pests and diseases. Severe winter rain and snow disasters and increased risks of pests and diseases in the coming year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Does the continued warmness mean that this year will be a mild winter? What impact will El Niño have on the climate this winter? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The National Climate Center issued a climate prediction bulletin on the 3rd, stating that the temperature in most parts of my country this winter will be close to or higher than normal for the same period of the year. The temperature has obvious phase characteristics, with the first winter being warmer and the latter winter close to normal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Whether it is a warm winter depends on whether the temperature can reach the warm winter standard.” Jia Xiaolong said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Monitoring shows that the equatorial central and eastern Pacific Ocean has entered an El Niño state, and an El Niño event is about to form. Affected by this, abnormal anticyclonic circulation prevails in the lower troposphere over the northwest Pacific and South China Sea in winter, the East Asian trough is weak, the East Asian winter monsoon is weak, and temperatures in most central and eastern my country are higher than normal for the same period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, the abnormal anticyclonic circulation is conducive to the transport of warm and moist water vapor from the tropics to the south of my country. In conjunction with the movement of cold air southward, it is easy to cause excessive precipitation in the southern region. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Statistics show that in the context of El Niño events, winter temperatures fluctuate greatly, and the number of cold air events that affect our country is often high. It is recommended to pay close attention to the possible adverse effects of periodic low-temperature rain and snow weather processes.&quot; Jia Xiaolong said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[贫困大学生哭诉助学金被挤占：福利如何才能落到需要的人手里？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259963]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-04 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a video of poor college students crying about being squeezed out of their scholarship qualifications has been widely circulated on social networks. attracted great attention. Tianjin Sino-German University of Applied Sciences, which was involved in the incident, said on November 2 that it had set up a special work team to conduct investigation and verification as soon as possible. The subsequent investigation results will be handled in accordance with regulations and announced in a timely manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the video posted online, a boy said that his father died and his mother married when he was young, and his grandfather also passed away when he was 18 years old. Now he only has his grandma as a relative. Their family is registered locally. poor households. After entering college, he received national scholarships in previous years, but this year, the class held a scholarship qualification selection, and he was not selected. The students who were selected were wearing real AJ sneakers (a sneaker brand owned by Nike, the price Not cheap), using Apple 14 Pro Max mobile phone and iPad Pro tablet, often having dinner parties and traveling. He reported the situation to the counselor, but was forced to move out of the dormitory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If this is true, it is really outrageous, and this video has attracted a lot of attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In reality, fraud in scholarship applications is nothing new in some colleges and universities. National scholarships for colleges and universities are financial aid provided by the state finance to college students with financial difficulties. They are mainly used to meet the living expenses of students. The average aid standard is 3,000 yuan per person per year (not equal, can be divided into 2-3 levels), about 20% students may receive financial aid. Bursaries are a benefit provided by the state to some poor college students. Since it is welfare, how to distribute it and how to let people who really need it get this money is a very important issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to this student, their class’s scholarship qualifications were selected by the whole class because he was not satisfied with the results of the first selection and went to the teacher to report it. As a result, he came last in the second selection. , became the person least qualified to receive scholarships in the class. The whole class selection seems very &quot;reasonable&quot;, but when used here, it is undoubtedly very absurd. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Who is in financial difficulty and who is not is not a matter decided by one person and one vote. If the selection is held, it will become a &quot;connection&quot; competition, and it is inevitable that some students will form gangs and even bribe the vote. As for truly poor students, they may not be able to mingle with better-off classmates due to financial constraints, and as a result, they may not be eligible for financial aid. On social networks, it is not uncommon for a group of people to &quot;unite together&quot; to promote one person to receive a scholarship and treat them to dinner, and then another person will take turns to receive it next time. Such posts are not uncommon. As a result, some colleges and universities have issued notices that award-winning students are not allowed to use their scholarships to treat guests, otherwise their qualifications for future assessments will be cancelled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some schools and classes even ask students applying for financial aid to tell their situations in front of the whole class and &quot;campaign&quot; for financial aid. This is letting people show their scars for others to see, which may cause a huge blow to the students&#39; self-esteem. Although some students are poor, they do not want others to know, especially in public. After all, poverty is not something worth showing off, and not everyone is compassionate. It is common for students to laugh at poor students in school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is also not a good idea to let counselors, class teachers, etc. have the decision-making power about scholarship eligibility. First of all, it is difficult to ensure that these people are completely public-minded in the quota allocation process. Maybe most counselors are fair, but it is inevitable that there will be a few who are partial. Sometimes, financial aid eligibility may even become a tool to blackmail students into &quot;obedience.&quot; Secondly, counselors and others may not be able to fully understand the students&#39; financial situation, and lack sufficient and correct information to make correct judgments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There should be some objective criteria for determining scholarship qualifications, rather than just subjective determination, whether it is the subjectivity of an individual person (identification by the counselor or class teacher) or the subjectivity of the entire class (selection by the whole class) . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is the objective standard? Theoretically, it can be whether the student&#39;s family income is below a certain standard. However, schools cannot directly obtain the income and assets of students&#39; families, so many schools ask poor students to provide poverty certificates from village committees or neighborhood committees. But these proofs are not entirely credible. For one, these proofs of poverty are not necessarily true. Especially for many rural areas, when village students are admitted to college, even if their families are not particularly poor, it is not difficult to go to the village committee to issue a poverty certificate. After all, they are all fellow villagers, and a certificate can alleviate the family&#39;s financial burden. Many village cadres will cover the burden unless the family&#39;s income is significantly higher than the village average. Secondly, the poverty standards in different regions are also different. Poverty in economically developed regions and poverty in western regions are completely different concepts. In recent years, there have been frequent cases of government officials visiting &quot;poor&quot; people and being criticized. Although some of them are falsely poor, there are also some misunderstandings caused by differences in regional economic levels. Therefore, the family poverty certificate issued by the place of origin can only be a reference and should not be used as a deciding factor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How should the scholarship qualifications be determined? This is of course a very complex issue and difficult to achieve completely ideally. But there are still some standards that can be referenced. For example, applying for a student loan can be a necessary condition. In the national student aid policy system, student loans are mainly used to solve the tuition and accommodation fees problems of students with financial difficulties. Nowadays, the tuition and accommodation fees of most schools are much higher than the scholarship standards. If you can pay for tuition and accommodation by yourself, it means you are not too poor. Otherwise, you can apply for a student loan to pay tuition and keep your own money for living expenses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can also observe students’ consumption on campus. The approach of Nanjing University of Science and Technology is a good reference. In 2016, Nanjing University of Science and Technology analyzed student consumption data in the cafeteria and listed those students who ate more than 60 meals in the cafeteria per month with a total consumption of no more than 420 yuan as aid recipients, and paid money directly to their meal cards. This is a very smart approach. As we all know, food in school cafeterias is much cheaper than outside. If a student eats almost every meal in the school cafeteria and the average consumption per meal is not high, there is a high probability that he is a poor student. Rich students either eat less in the on-campus cafeteria and often eat out and order takeout, or they spend more in the cafeteria and eat well. Eating is a basic necessity for people, whether rich or poor, everyone needs to eat, so using food consumption level as a measurement standard can cover all students. And the level of food consumption is difficult to fake. It is difficult for a person who is accustomed to a high standard of diet to continue to lower his dietary standards for a few months if the economic conditions do not change. Of course, this approach may also be used opportunistically, eating a little in the cafeteria for each meal, and then going out to eat and drink, but I am afraid that there are not many rich people who can persist in this way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, as a welfare provided by the national finance to poor students, the national scholarship should be used wisely to truly reduce the burden of life for poor students, and should not become Tang Monk meat that everyone wants to eat. Tianjin Sino-German University of Applied Sciences officially stated that it has launched an investigation and hopes that the investigation and handling results will be fair and just. More importantly, the problem of unfair distribution of scholarships occurs in many colleges and universities, and should arouse the vigilance of all colleges and universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 13:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[当一个盲人想要登上珠峰]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259956]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-04 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/03/olqpWxQWEpUrbnUzTSjDFES4jSoUR9IEeffnviOT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;641&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/olqpWxQWEpUrbnUzTSjDFES4jSoUR9IEeffnviOT. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256991&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;During the climb, there were crisscrossing and completely irregular ice cracks underfoot. Zhang Hong You need to use trekking poles to test the location and terrain first, then use your feet to measure the approximate width of the crevasse, and finally dare to step out. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Standing on the top of the world&#39;s highest peak, blind man Zhang Hong&#39;s first thought was &quot; Get down quickly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Most of the mountaineering accidents occur on the way down the mountain.” Zhang Hong said that when climbing, a person’s center of gravity is first. Even if he falls, the mountain will block him. When going down the mountain, “it all depends on the subconscious mind.” . He felt at ease until he returned to Everest Base Camp and took off his crampons - which meant that danger was truly far away. Sherpa (note: local people living on both sides of the Himalayas, usually serving as guides) gave him a cup of milk tea and a few biscuits to satisfy his hunger. The climb to the summit and back nearly exhausted his strength, and he nearly fell into coma. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two years later, the cognitive system composed of sound, hearing and touch makes his memories of the world’s highest peak still vivid. He clearly felt the difference in wind at different altitudes: the wind from the glaciers at low altitudes was mixed with freezing cold air, the storms at high altitudes made loud noises, and the strong winds picked up snow particles, ice slag and small rocks, giving people a sticky feel. , like a high wall that is insurmountable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hiking across the glacier, the ice on the soles of your feet has a hard texture, and there is a &quot;click&quot; sound like biting potato chips when you step on it. Even with crampons, the risk of slipping is unavoidable. The snow is thick, and the sound of footsteps is muffled in it, giving people a more solid feeling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 24, 2021, at the 8848.86-meter summit of Mount Everest, Zhang Hong followed the example of his predecessors and left several photos and a 15-second short video. The former became his WeChat avatar, and the latter was the certificate of his record as &quot;the first blind man in Asia to climb Mount Everest&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the news of the successful summit reached Fan Lixin’s base camp, the documentary director had mixed emotions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He was happy that Zhang Hong’s years of hard work had paid off. In 2019, he heard about Zhang Hong&#39;s ambition from a mountaineering friend: a blind masseur eager to climb Mount Everest. Everyone around him thought it was unreliable, but Fan Lixin became curious about this character. Like a gambler, he wanted to film this story that was very likely to fail. In May 2020, the documentary was launched, and the fate of the two &quot;paranoid&quot; people intersected since then. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is worrying is that due to an oxygen problem, the two accompanying photographers were not able to go up together. The video footage of Zhang Hong’s summit was blank. Fan Lixin cried out that she collapsed, “It’s hard for a clever woman to make a meal without rice.” On October 27, 2023, the documentary &quot;The Invisible Peak&quot; was released nationwide. Fan Lixin filled the gap in the material with a &quot;black&quot; segment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;We shot more than 360 hours of material, and it took a year to edit. When editing, I was thinking, if there is no material for this section, why not use a black field and an immersive (Sound experience), immersing the audience into the world of a blind person.&quot; Fan Lixin told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;Use this black field to take the audience to the top of the world, following Zhang Hong&#39;s footsteps.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/WivtRGd596cs3s9SoNMddIhhBxMGdd3QSXOa6bhS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;641&quot; data- src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/WivtRGd596cs3s9SoNMddIhhBxMGdd3QSXOa6bhS.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256989&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text -align: center;&quot;>;Zhang Hong and his wife Xia Qiong. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Hong has an almost paranoid desire to climb Mount Everest. At that time, he was working as the deputy director of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Department of a hospital in Tibet. He was in his forties, had a stable job, worked with his wife, and had a son. Everyone was puzzled by his &quot;crazy&quot; desire to climb Mount Everest: &quot;This thing is completely unreliable. I have such a good job in my hand, and I have stabilized, and I still want to do this. This is full.&quot; I can hold on.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Hong admitted that obsession comes from a certain desire to prove something. &quot;I used to label myself as an unfortunate person in society. But the process of climbing Mount Everest taught me one thing: In fact, I am the same as everyone else, and society and nature have no regard for me. I don’t look at it differently.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“Mount Everest will not give me more sympathy just because I am blind”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Official filming of the summit Fan Lixin followed Zhang Hong for more than a year. At that time, Zhang Hong&#39;s biggest anxiety during his trip to Mount Everest was money. When the documentary was launched, Zhang Hong received support of US$5,000 from a foundation, but there was still a big gap between the &quot;small one million&quot; RMB. In front of the camera, Zhang Hong took advantage of the wine and asked his brother in embarrassment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I didn&#39;t know much about it at the time. To be honest, I was quite anxious. If he couldn&#39;t raise the money, he wouldn&#39;t be able to go even if he wanted to,&quot; Fan Lixin told a reporter from Southern Weekend. &quot;It&#39;s possible that he would become a The story of &#39;Don Quixote.&#39;&quot; Later, through crowdfunding, brand intervention, and hospital support, Zhang Hong was able to scrape together the money one week before departure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Hong took the traditional route to climb Mount Everest. Take a helicopter or small fixed-wing plane from Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, to the small town of Lukla, and then hike for 7 days to the Everest base camp, which is &quot;equivalent to initial adaptive training.&quot; After a short rest at the base camp, the team conducted two training sessions. The destination of the first training session is Lobuche, which is more than 6,100 meters high; the second training session involves climbing to the C3 camp at an altitude of 8,300 meters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fan Lixin has never climbed a mountain before, and Luo Buche, who was training for the first time, was the first mountain he had climbed. When he was a child, he had an operation on his leg and one-third of his knee was cut off, making it difficult for him to climb Mount Everest with Zhang Hong. He invited two mountain photographers, including the producer who also served as a sound engineer, and the team was streamlined to only four people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Climbing from the base camp to the C1 camp, the altitude does not increase much, but you have to pass through the Khumbu Glacier, which is known as the &quot;terrible glacier&quot;. There are trenches in the glacier. In the wide ice ravine, two ladders were stacked together to form a bridge, and people and cameras trembled across it. Even Sherpas who have competed with Mount Everest all year round cannot take it lightly. During the filming of the documentary, a Sherpa fell into an ice ravine and hung on by a thread. After the people in the same team worked hard to rescue him, his body was curled up and his ears were purple from the cold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Climbers with normal vision can take one step and look at ten steps, but Zhang Hong can only stare at the current step. Every step is difficult. With every step he took, he silently recited in his heart: &quot;This snowfield accepted me again, and the footprints under my feet carried me again.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/23/11/03/WPjpaab7QJy6eKt9fLqo3FPrpOBP9neXcuFCWk76.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/03/WPjpaab7QJy6eKt9fLqo3FPrpOBP9neXcuFCWk76.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256990&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;When shooting on Mount Everest, the biggest difficulty was the electricity , because the diesel generator needs to come up little by little and can only be charged by solar energy. However, the sun is often not seen for three to five days when climbing, and the documentary team often feels anxious. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Everest will not give me more sympathy just because I am blind. There is an ice cave under the glacier, and there is a cliff next to it. The ladder is also shaky, and the difficulty will not be reduced just because I can&#39;t see it.&quot; When Zhang Hong climbed the mountain for the first time, he was hit by a similar feeling, &quot;I can feel that I and Everyone is the same, doing one thing in an equal and fair environment, there is no barrier between me and everyone, instead of before I thought that I was an unfortunate and alternative existence.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, due to the inability to see, ice climbing poses many obstacles to Zhang Hong. Fan Lixin said that the weather in the Himalayas was bad that year and the road conditions were complicated. When climbing an ice wall, sighted climbers can step on the ice pits that have been stepped on by the person in front of them. But Zhang Hong couldn&#39;t see it. The steel crampons under his feet were difficult to accurately kick into the old pit, and it took more effort than ordinary people to kick out the new pit. When hanging on the ice wall, the climber relies on three points of support, pulling the rope with one hand and smashing the ice with an ice ax with the other hand to pull his body upwards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;We can see it, so we probably know where to hit it, and it will get more force. But he can&#39;t see it, so he just chisels randomly. If he chisels once, the ice will fly away and the chisel will be in vain, so he has to chisel again. Climbing an ice wall of more than ten meters is very tiring.&quot; Fan Lixin observed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the first training session, Zhang Hong suddenly lost his temper and said he no longer wanted to climb, and asked for a helicopter to be sent to pick him up. Some people in the team felt that his pace could not keep up with the progress and slowed down the progress. Zhang Hong looked displeased. &quot;He needs to get in touch with the team. He will feel that the risk is too high. He is not afraid that something will happen to him. What he is most afraid of is that he has not really climbed yet, and he is injured just in training, or his physical strength Exhausted.&quot; Fan Lixin told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Above five or six thousand meters above sea level, people’s emotions and thinking are completely different from those in the plains.” Zhang Hong analyzed his mentality at the time, “If you haven’t climbed (officially) yet, it’s better to practice. It’s not worth it if you get injured during the training.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the second training session, Zhang Hong suffered from an attack of cholecystitis, which caused his facial features to twist tightly together in pain. Back at base camp, the camp doctor examined him.张洪从旁人那里得知，医生建议把他送回加德满都治疗，“甚至要动手术”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“一旦去治疗，攀登几乎就告吹了。”张洪把自己裹进睡袋，崩溃地哭了出来。 “时间不等人，天气不好，窗口期有限，就那么几天。不能因为这点事情，就放弃攀登。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他责怪自己没有对此做好预案，但又对病痛无计可施，只能尽力揉搓腹部，按摩肝经和胆经。他攀登珠峰，一个原因是为了打破外界对盲人的刻板印象，盲人不只能做按摩这行。但命定般的，按摩两三天后，病状真的缓解了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“一切都是天意。”他说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/pxIY9yIS7ks79vnYsbBCixImw9AWvHoKHvS1nygy.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/pxIY9yIS7ks79vnYsbBCixImw9AWvHoKHvS1nygy.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256987&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2021年5月24日，已经失明25年的张洪成功从尼泊尔一侧登上世界最高峰珠穆朗玛峰，成为亚洲首位登上珠峰的盲人。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;登顶&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;冲顶时刻在2021年5月23日晚上七点到来。张洪、中方向导、摄影师以及夏尔巴从C4营地出发向珠峰顶进发。离峰顶只有100米时，意外出现了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;恶劣的天气冻坏了所有人的氧气调节阀，导致氧气泄漏。大家一合计，现有的氧气量难以支持所有人登顶。强子是张洪的中方向导，有过15年的高山向导经验，但从未登顶过珠峰。对登山爱好者来说，2小时就能攀完的那100米，是个“巨大的诱惑”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;强子最终决定把自己的氧气让出来，两位摄影师做出同样决定，三人下撤，由夏尔巴陪同张洪一个人登顶。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;范立欣后来问及放弃原因。强子说，和张洪认识三四年里，一路见证他的不易和委屈。 “我是真心不愿意让他再走一趟，可能他这辈子也不会再有第二次机会再走了。训练、筹钱，顶住周围社会的舆论，亲戚朋友的质疑——你看不见，冒这么大的险干什么？大家不会想到说一个盲人也有权利去实现自己的理想，去追寻自己的人生价值，同时也为这个家里争口气。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;三个夏尔巴和张洪连在一根绳上，张洪推上升器前进。一个夏尔巴在约1.5米前引路，两人语言不通，只靠简单的英语词汇“go”“up”“down”交流。还有两个夏尔巴在后面背着氧气，其中一个夏尔巴偶尔拍拍他的腿，“表示安慰和鼓励”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;登顶前，最难的一段路程是“希拉里台阶”，那是一片刃状山脊，岩壁几近垂直，连“雪都挂不住”。张洪预估，窄处大概仅30公分，仅能容留下半只脚。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;手在这时成了他的眼睛。他一只手支撑，另一只手顺着脚尖往前探路，找到下一步的脚落点后，再靠另一只手寻找支撑点，每迈一步，“得停下来休息好久好久”。张洪形容，攀爬希拉里台阶，就像穿梭在他视力尚健全时看过的那种人造假山里，石缝完全不规则，“根本不知道下一步怎么走”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“希拉里台阶”距离峰顶只有12米，却花了张洪两个多小时。攀登时，他一度失去了时间概念，隔一段时间就左右摇晃绳子，询问领路的夏尔巴：“How long? How long?”夏尔巴的回答每次都是半小时。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“结果过了好几个半个小时还没到。也许我过了5分钟就问还有多久，过了10分钟又问。”张洪有点焦急，说了几次“不行”“我要死了”“我要下去”。起先夏尔巴并未理会他的抱怨，最后一次夏尔巴也被弄生气了，带着情绪同意了张洪要放弃的请求，转身准备帮他解掉上升器，换上下降器。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/FZaEOpaZ1qtetpzFuojXRkKa8TGvXX6nZFA75asj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;586&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/FZaEOpaZ1qtetpzFuojXRkKa8TGvXX6nZFA75asj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256988&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;范立欣回忆，那一年印度洋有两三个大的气旋，导致珠峰下大雪刮大风，张洪登顶那天，风速达到每小时60公里，人几乎要被吹倒，如果衣服划破、羽绒飞掉，后果将是“瞬间失温死掉”。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不甘的情绪攫住了张洪，他对夏尔巴说：“Go!

Go! ”“继续走。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;爬着爬着，张洪突然感觉冰爪踩上了一处软软的雪地，越往前走越觉得踩感厚实，直至积雪深得能将整只脚掌覆盖。他一下子撞上了前面人的背包。 “You summit（你登顶了）。”他听见领路的夏尔巴转过头对他说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我并没有以为真的登顶了。”张洪回忆，“我也不知道走到哪里，反正就是这样走。可能是因为太累，还没能从&#39;走一步算一步&#39;的专注度里反应过来。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他的感官先于意识捕捉到了周边环境的变化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上山时，张洪无形中感知到，正在攀爬的山体，像一个巨大的障碍挡在面前。但在那一刻，障碍感消失了。他听出周围变得空旷，一览无余的那种空旷。他把头往左转了转，又往右转了转，仔细听了听周围的声音，风声剧烈地在他的头上打转，听得他“毛骨悚然”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他们在珠峰顶上停留时间不长，张洪听见夏尔巴说，“Photo, photo”，快速了留了几张影，下了山才知道，还拍了认证视频。他后来告诉范立欣，只听到对讲机里一直窜着各种听不懂的语言。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“他想起那个瞬间，甚至是有一点可笑，他准备了那么多年，准备了很多姿势、豪言壮语要在珠峰上说一下，什么都没有，就2秒钟，他就醒悟过来说，赶紧往下，这个地方太可怕了，就像地狱一样，那个风声呼号。”范立欣回忆，“他以前失明的时候，真的觉得世界崩塌，就像在地狱里一样。他说我爬了20年，从地狱里爬到平地上，再从平地爬到珠峰顶。（到了峰顶）感觉好像又到了地狱一样，于是赶紧往山下下。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;结束攀登后，他们被新一轮新冠疫情困在尼泊尔。那阵子，正是外部最喧腾的时候，范立欣统计过，包括BBC、法新社在内七十余家国际主流媒体都在报道他。张洪说，自己当时并未沉浸在被聚光灯照着的感觉中。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“他爬完珠峰以后才发现，登顶珠峰根本不是他所需要的高光时刻，而是让他明白了，当下的这一步是最重要的。因为这一步没有踩好，可能就掉下去，人就没了，根本没有什么所谓的高光时刻。真正的高光时刻有可能在你最危险的时刻才刚开始，电影里面的向导也说了：登顶不是终点，回到家里才是终点。”在尼泊尔时，范立欣和他聊天，“他说，你现在告诉我我现在站的地方就是珠峰顶，我也相信，因为我看不见”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;他想让别人觉得，盲人不只会做按摩师&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;刚开始拍摄张洪时，范立欣觉得他是个有些急躁的人，调试设备或更换电池的空隙，张洪会显得有些焦躁。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;急躁来源于他的突然失明。 21岁那年，一次青光眼发作，他永久性丧失了视力。花了三四年时间，张洪尝试接受看不见这件事，性格也因此发生改变，他变得“情绪崩溃”“脾气暴躁”，要拿的东西没拿到，或者无意间碰翻了杯子都会展露急躁的一面。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;妻子夏琼柔软地接住了这些瞬间。她有一次试着换位思考丈夫的处境，把自己关在屋子里，熄灭全部的灯，闭紧窗户，“感觉四面墙都向你挤压过来”。她体会到丈夫身处未知的环境里，那种对危险的紧张感。 “本来是很温顺的一只羊，自由的物种，突然间被困在一个看不见的黑色牢笼里。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张洪小时候的成长环境，和“盲”紧密黏连。他的父亲和叔叔都是盲人，视力健全的他有时充当“盲杖”，三人拉一根竹竿，张洪就在前面领路。遇上雨天，路面滑湿，张洪摔倒，连着父亲和叔叔一起摔跤。在农村社会，他很早就感知到了盲人的境遇。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我从小知道他们的生活，想到自己以后也要生活在这样的环境里面，就没有办法接受。”张洪说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;夏琼察觉到，家庭背景和童年记忆，在张洪内心生出一种自我防御机制。结婚前，张洪从未和她主动谈起过父亲和叔叔的情况。他们结识于张洪还能和世界目光交错时，后来张洪失明，她调侃说，自己是被金庸的武侠小说给“害”了，侠肝义胆地觉得，“不应该让他一个人孤零零的没人管”。 1999年，相恋3年的两人决定扯证。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;家族长辈们众口一致地反对，父亲在夏琼面前哭了出来。张洪承诺她：“我一定会让你家里人对你刮目相看。”她想，也许是从那个时候起，为丈夫之后的“不断折腾”埋下了伏笔。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在西藏安定下来前的二十年里，夏琼形容他们的生活是“风雨飘摇”。张洪在学校里学的专业是推拿，但并不醉心于此。失明后，专业反而救了他，让他不至于吃不上饭。夏琼也学了推拿。夫妻俩先是在成都当按摩师，日子过得“苟且偷生”。后来去上海的按摩店里打工，两人水平能排到“店里的前一二名”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2005年，夏琼回家待产，收到张洪从上海寄来的保健品，她知道丈夫又“折腾”了。张洪背着她把工作辞了，去干销售。 “他有时候跟人家讲，他在上海一个人在地铁里面找不到出路，被困在地铁里面，在上海的马路上被困在十字路口。”夏琼说，“他是想要让别人觉得盲人不单单只会做按摩师，还会做别的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2019年，登上7500多米的慕士塔格峰后，张洪决定为登珠峰做准备。为了节省开销，他采用了最经济划算的训练方式——爬楼梯。爬的同时穿上高山靴，戴阻氧面罩，同时负重二十多公斤，每天爬三四个小时。他住在医院的公寓楼，每天从一楼爬到十二楼，再坐电梯下来。碰见医院的同事，他感受到压力，“身边无数人质疑，觉得这哥们不但瞎了，还疯了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;忍受身边人的异样眼光和筹措不到资金的困局，无数次，他坐上电梯后，手指在一层和自己家所在的层数犹豫、徘徊，“一直这样纠结了两年”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“有的人可能会觉得让妻子温饱，儿女有钱读书就可以；有的人觉得要给孩子一个榜样，让爱的人在人前人后脸上都有光。”夏琼说，丈夫张洪“可能是后者”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张洪成功登顶珠峰后，一些细微的变化隐然发生。从前医院里的人提起张洪，是“夏医生的老公”，如今，他们称呼她为“张洪的太太”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;儿子两岁时，夏琼和一位亲戚关掉灯，在一片黑黢黢中问儿子：天黑了，你要保护谁？两岁的儿子奶乎乎地说：保护爸爸。夏琼和女亲戚百思不得其解：我们都是女性，为什么要保护爸爸？儿子想都不想地说：因为爸爸看不见。如今，儿子觉得爸爸“很可以”“比较强大”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;范立欣和夏琼都观察到，攀登珠峰成功之后，生活中的张洪变得松弛许多。失明之后，他曾一度难以接受弱人一等的感受。他和每一个普通人一样有自己的缺点，但他宁愿听到平视的批评，也不要俯视的褒奖。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“攀登珠峰之前，我在外面那么多年，从来不跟别人讲起我家人的事情，只有我老婆知道，除此之外没有第三个人知道，但是珠峰下来以后，我可以跟任何人分享我家里发生的任何事情，包括我爸爸、叔叔看不见，以前我是没有办法面对，现在我可以从容地面对这些事情。”张洪说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“制造业当家关键在于人”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259951]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-04 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;In 2008, Hu Xiaoyan was elected as the first batch of migrant workers to the National People&#39;s Congress.

In order to pay off the foreign debt of more than 20,000 yuan owed by her family, she decided to leave her hometown of Guang&#39;an, Sichuan and embark on the furthest journey in her life. A trip - to work in Guangdong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;35 years later, Hu Xiaoyan is already the full-time vice chairman of Foshan Sanshui District Federation of Industry and Commerce. On October 25, 2023, at the third &quot;Storytelling Meeting on the 45th Anniversary of Reform and Opening Up&quot;, she recalled the years when she first arrived in Guangdong to work hard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In ten years, Hu Xiaoyan rose from a female assembly line worker in an electronics factory to the management of a ceramic production workshop, and was selected as one of the &quot;Top Ten Migrant Workers in Foshan&quot;. In 2008, for the first time, three representatives of the migrant workers group participated in the National Two Sessions, including Hu Xiaoyan from Guangdong, a major labor import province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since the reform and opening up, the &quot;tide of migrant workers&quot; has promoted China&#39;s industrialization and urbanization process. Guangdong is a major labor importer. In 1988 alone, the number of laborers from other provinces who came to work reached about 3 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The event was hosted by the Information Office of the Guangdong Provincial Government. In addition to Hu Xiaoyan, Shang Xiaodong, a second-level researcher at the South China Sea Institute of Oceanography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and a mechanical technician from Guangdong Province were also invited College teacher Yang Denghui tells his story. The three people are from different generations and backgrounds, but what they have in common is that they are all foreign talents from Guangdong. Shang Xiaodong was admitted to Taiyuan Institute of Technology (now Taiyuan University of Technology) after the resumption of the college entrance examination. He entered graduate school at the age of 32. In 2005, he came to Guangdong to research physical ocean research. Yang Denghui, who was born in 1997, is the champion of the CNC milling project of the World Skills Competition. He studied at the Guangdong Mechanical Technician College and was elected as a representative of the 14th National People&#39;s Congress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On October 26, 2023, workers at an agricultural science and technology enterprise in Yunfu City were cultivating flower seedlings.

This trend continues today. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the number of migrant workers was 78.49 million at the beginning of the century, and the total number in 2022 exceeded 295 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Guangdong occupies three of the four major special economic zones identified in 1979, which has created a huge demand for labor. Hu Xiaoyan thus joined the ranks heading south. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The emergence of migrant workers has also highlighted the problem of migrant workers. In 2006, relevant documents from the State Council mentioned that there were problems such as low wages and arrears for migrant workers, and many occupational diseases and work-related injuries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In January 2008, Yang Chengyong, deputy director of the Election Committee of the Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial People&#39;s Congress, revealed to the media that Guangdong, as the province with the largest influx of migrant population, planned to elect After six migrant workers were elected as representatives to the Provincial People&#39;s Congress, one migrant worker was elected as a deputy to the National People&#39;s Congress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Before that, Guangdong had been at the forefront in protecting the political rights of migrant workers. In 2000, four outsiders were elected during the general election of the Shenzhen Municipal People’s Congress. Representatives of migrant workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the end, Hu Xiaoyan became the first batch of migrant workers to be a deputy to the National People&#39;s Congress, but before that, she had never served as a deputy to any people&#39;s congress at the township, county, city, or province levels. Hu Xiaoyan recalled to Southern Weekend reporters: &quot;I don&#39;t find it difficult because I already live among them (migrant workers).&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Hu Xiaoyan mentioned To: &quot;The first batch of migrant workers to represent the National People&#39;s Congress became the most eye-catching label on me. From then on, I began to learn how to conduct research, write suggestions, speak, and learn how to perform my duties.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After becoming a deputy to the National People&#39;s Congress, she used her vacation time to visit workers and put forward suggestions including criminalizing unpaid wages, connecting with medical insurance, off-site college entrance examinations, and housing benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At almost the same time, national policies also shifted to consider the new needs generated by migrant workers entering cities. Hu Xiaoyan once suggested “allowing the children of migrant workers to take the college entrance examination in the workplace.” At the end of 2013, Guangdong Province officially announced the implementation measures for the college entrance examination for migrant children in other places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Today, more &quot;Hu Xiaoyans&quot; have become deputies to the National People&#39;s Congress. Among the deputies to the 14th National People&#39;s Congress, there are 56 migrant workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On October 26, 2023, students are practicing industrial robot operation at the Technician College in Zhaoqing, Guangdong.

It&#39;s just that it&#39;s much older. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The turning point occurred in 1978. Shang Xiaodong heard that his high school classmates were admitted to college, and he began to prepare for the exam. In the second year, he relied on self-study and was admitted to the physics teaching class of the Department of Physics Basics of Taiyuan Institute of Technology. After graduation, he was assigned to serve as a teacher at the Command College of the Chinese People&#39;s Armed Police Force. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;More than ten years later, he keenly discovered that there were more masters around him, and he felt that &quot;if you don&#39;t study, you will fall behind.&quot; After completing his postgraduate studies in the Department of Mechanics of Tianjin University, he went to Hong Kong, China and the United States for further studies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2005, Shang Xiaodong came to Guangdong and entered the South China Sea Institute of Oceanography, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Previously, Guangdong had just issued the “Decision on Accelerating the Construction of a Strong Science and Technology Province.” &quot;There is a good scientific research atmosphere here, and there is a passion for pioneering and bold attempts. This is why our family chose to take root in Guangdong.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Just returned to China At that time, ocean observation instruments had long been monopolized by foreign countries, so Shang Xiaodong decided to lead his team to independently develop ocean observation instruments. In the end, the team developed the &quot;fast temperature sensor for ocean detection&quot; with the fastest response in the world, with a response time of 7 milliseconds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Under the policy of &quot;strengthening the province through science and technology&quot;, Guangdong also hopes to solve the problem of &quot;two skins&quot; between technology and economy. Empowering new manufacturing industries with new technologies focuses on the integration of technological innovation and industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yang Denghui said that after enrolling in a technician college in 2014, he &quot;competed with things thinner than a hair every day.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yang Denghui, who was born as a technician, saw the new demand for talents behind the &quot;manufacturing industry&quot;. “The key to success in the manufacturing industry lies in people.” He believes that in addition to scientific research talents like Shang Xiaodong, it also needs a large number of highly skilled talents to support it. This is an important reason why he chose to stay in Guangdong Mechanical Technician College to teach. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After entering the school, Yang Denghui was selected into the training team preparing for the 43rd World Skills Competition. The training project was CNC milling, which is an automatic processing technology that uses computers. Drawing and programming realize part machining. At that time, China had not won a gold medal in this event. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;If you want to achieve success in CNC milling projects, you must practice &quot;knife skills&quot;: choose appropriate tools according to different materials and production requirements of the parts, and strictly control them The accuracy of parts and components is controlled within 0.02 mm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2017, Yang Denghui, who started his career again, won the CNC milling championship at the 44th World Skills Competition. He was only 20 years old that year. After graduation, he joined the technical education team, and the students he guided won the world championship gold medal in this project again in 2019 and 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Data from the Guangdong Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security show that currently, the total number of skilled talents in Guangdong is 18.5 million, including 6.31 million highly skilled talents. Talents account for 34.1%. In 2023, Yang Denghui will also become a representative of the National People&#39;s Congress, and naturally he will focus on the cultivation of skilled talents in performing his duties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;(Hope) to help skilled employees break through the &#39;ceiling&#39; for promotion, so that more talents can make a difference in Guangdong.&quot; Yang Denghui expressed at the event His vision. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 11:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
