Systemically important banks have relatively high structural and business complexity, and relatively strong correlations with other financial institutions. Therefore, data from systemically important banks better reflects the latest changes in the banking industry and even the macroeconomy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, 19 of the 20 systemically important banks have been listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges, making them the most fully disclosed group in the banking industry. Since 2023, which industries have the best and worst credit assets of systemically important banks? Which banks have the most effective measures to resolve non-performing assets? Which banks have the most adequate disclosure of information about their non-performing assets? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/KU05QNvacT2454pc07mF5N96XaXW9ba7BNOE2Bht.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;823&quot; height= &quot;1102&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/KU05QNvacT2454pc07mF5N96XaXW9ba7BNOE2Bht.png&quot; data-key=&quot;254389&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend New For this purpose, researchers from the Financial Research Center conducted a special review and data analysis of the interim reports of the 20 listed banks with the largest assets (including 19 systemically important banks and China Zheshang Bank). The study found that as of the end of June, the total loan balance of 20 listed banks was nearly 150 trillion yuan, accounting for 63.5% of the total loan scale of all financial institutions; the total scale of non-performing loans was approximately 1.92 trillion yuan, accounting for approximately 48% of the total scale of non-performing assets of financial institutions. %, the average non-performing loan ratio is about 1.28%, which is lower than the average non-performing loan ratio of the banking industry of 1.62%, indicating that the credit quality of large and medium-sized commercial banks is better than that of small and medium-sized banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/c1xyT4WmIiFkCsZMbpjnzE0OzRXIqazCqTH9Y9t8.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;866&quot; height= &quot;1161&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/c1xyT4WmIiFkCsZMbpjnzE0OzRXIqazCqTH9Y9t8.png&quot; data-key=&quot;254388&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the real estate industry , manufacturing and business services industries rank among the top three in terms of non-performing loan size, and the accommodation and catering industry, real estate industry and mining industry have the highest average non-performing loan ratio. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The balance of non-performing credit card loans exceeded that of personal housing loans for the first time in three years, and the non-performing loan rate was 4.2 times higher than that of personal housing loans. Looking at the regional distribution of non-performing loans, the western region has the largest scale of non-performing loans, and the northeastern region has the highest average non-performing loan ratio. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Large loan size and low NPL ratio&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;: &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Transportation, warehousing and postal industry&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Which Which industry receives the greatest support from bank credit? Are their NPL ratios positively or negatively related to bank support? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center combed through the interim reports of 20 listed banks and found that each bank disclosed the distribution of corporate loans in 20 major industries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Manufacturing, leasing and business services, transportation, warehousing and postal services are the three industries with the most credit granted by the 20 listed banks. The total loan balance of the three industries at the end of June exceeded 10 trillion. Yuan. With regulators vigorously promoting the high-quality development of the manufacturing industry, the manufacturing industry has become a credit area that major commercial banks attach great importance to. Among the 20 listed banks, 19 banks rank in the top two in terms of manufacturing investment scale. However, the leasing and business services industry ranks first among the 20 banks’ credit lending industries the most, with 10 companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Has the massive increase in industry credit been accompanied by a sharp increase in non-performing loans since then? An analysis by researchers at the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center found that increased credit in some industries is indeed positively related to the growth of non-performing loans. This is especially obvious in the real estate industry. As the credit scale ranks fourth in the industry and the average non-performing rate in the industry ranks second, it has become the industry with the most concentrated credit risks of commercial banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/vgPrJUQ2nLXiSlObE8Fzc7N5dSltXXMiOjja0SgM.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1161&quot; height= &quot;866&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/vgPrJUQ2nLXiSlObE8Fzc7N5dSltXXMiOjja0SgM.png&quot; data-key=&quot;254394&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But 20 The industry distribution of credit granted by listed banks does not completely coincide with the industry distribution of non-performing loans. As of the end of June 2023, the average non-performing ratios of the manufacturing, leasing and business services, transportation, warehousing, and postal industries that provide the most credit are only 1.8%, 1.45%, and 0.64% respectively. The real estate, manufacturing, leasing and business services industries have the highest scale of non-performing loans, with balances of non-performing loans reaching 295.1 billion, 266 billion and 208.8 billion respectively. The total scale is close to 770 billion, accounting for 57% of the non-performing balance of corporate loans. The total non-performing loans 40%. Among them, the transportation, warehousing and postal industry has credit extensions of up to 13.8 trillion yuan, but its non-performing ratio is only 0.64%. It is a typical industry with large loan scale and low non-performing ratio. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/iOEc7BaPZJefEo0xqN46JDitJsV7XWfvxsIa9v4v.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;866&quot; height= &quot;1232&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/iOEc7BaPZJefEo0xqN46JDitJsV7XWfvxsIa9v4v.png&quot; data-key=&quot;254395&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The study also found , the increase in the scale of credit in a certain industry is not necessarily accompanied by the year-on-year increase in the scale of non-performing loans. For example, compared with the end of 2022, as of the end of June 2023, the manufacturing loan balance has increased by as high as 18.83%, and the loan growth rate is at the forefront of all industries, but its non-performing loan balance has remained the same or even slightly decreased compared with the end of 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Banks are most willing to lend in the &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Yangtze River Delta&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The intensity of credit support for different industries is differentiated At the same time, in which areas do banks have the greatest differentiation in their countercyclical investments? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center found that most of the 20 listed banks disclosed the regional distribution of credit and the regional distribution of non-performing loans, but each bank’s regional division method Not the same as above. Among them, the regional distribution rules of six banks, namely Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Postal Savings Bank of China, China Merchants Bank and China Minsheng Bank, are completely consistent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/DRt8TJKTWZsm2BkrO7sNFMTtJRxM7xsin7DSFAwD.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;866&quot; height= &quot;1303&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/DRt8TJKTWZsm2BkrO7sNFMTtJRxM7xsin7DSFAwD.png&quot; data-key=&quot;254398&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend New Researchers from the Financial Research Center analyzed the mid-term reports of the above-mentioned six banks and found that the six banks in the Yangtze River Delta region have the largest credit scale, the highest proportion, the fastest growth rate, and the lowest average non-performing loan ratio. Based on the conclusions of Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center&#39;s special survey on Suzhou&#39;s financial ecology in April 2023 (see Southern Weekend APP&#39;s &quot;Suzhou Financial Ecology In-depth Research Special Topic&quot; for details), researchers from Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center believe that as China&#39;s economic engine region , the financial ecology of the Yangtze River Delta region (mainly Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang) maintains a leading level in the country. Banks generally want and are willing to lend to the real economy, and the ultra-low non-performing ratio further strengthens the banks&#39; position in the Yangtze River Delta market. Dare to lend, truly lend, and increase confidence in credit extension. Therefore, the Yangtze River Delta region is undoubtedly the area where commercial banks dare to lend the most, and it is also a must-have for the banking industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/Dur70kGK5CVsiHXWbzgWexz8143TqmT8O493XNQ2.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;866&quot; height= &quot;975&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/Dur70kGK5CVsiHXWbzgWexz8143TqmT8O493XNQ2.png&quot; data-key=&quot;254396&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rated system Among the five city commercial banks that are important banks, four are from the Yangtze River Delta region. The asset scale, operating efficiency and asset quality of these city commercial banks are among the best in the industry. This proves that the Yangtze River Delta region has the best financial ecological environment in the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Correspondingly, the credit growth rate of the 20 listed banks in the northeastern region (Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning) is the slowest, the credit proportion continues to shrink, and the non-performing loan ratio is high among all regions in the country. Data shows that large state-owned banks are more determined than joint-stock banks and city commercial banks in implementing the strategic intentions of decision-makers to revitalize the Northeast. The financial support of large state-owned banks to the Northeast is also the mainstay for the stable operation of the financial industry in the Northeast. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Non-performing personal mortgage loans surged&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;The momentum eased&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Although corporate loans are the mainstay of commercial bank credit, personal loan business is becoming increasingly important , especially personal housing loans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scale of personal mortgage loans remains the largest among all personal loans of commercial banks, and the non-performing rate has been at the lowest level among all types of loan business for a long time. Therefore, it has become the most valued high-quality asset of commercial banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What changes have occurred in the asset quality of personal mortgage loans? In order to facilitate comparisons with the same caliber, researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center selected 10 banks’ personal mortgage businesses for statistical analysis. These 10 banks include six state-owned commercial banks, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Postal Savings Bank, and Bank of Communications, and four national joint-stock commercial banks, China Merchants Bank, Industrial Bank, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, and Minsheng Bank. As of the end of 2022, the total scale of personal mortgage loans of 10 banks accounts for 80% of the total scale of personal mortgage loans in the banking industry. Therefore, the personal mortgage business of the 10 banks has strong industry representation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Research shows that starting from 2022, the growth rate of non-performing loan balances of personal housing loans has increased significantly. At the end of June 2022, the total non-performing balance of personal housing loans of 10 listed banks was 104.871 billion yuan, a sharp increase of 16.8 billion yuan from the end of 2021, with a month-on-month growth rate of 19.1%; in the second half of 2022, the non-performing balance of personal housing loans of 10 listed banks increased again. An increase of 30.4 billion yuan. By the end of 2022, the total balance of non-performing loans has increased to 135.255 billion yuan, a year-on-year growth rate of 53.6%; in the first half of 2023, the balance of non-performing loans has reached 138.629 billion yuan, a year-on-year growth rate of 32.2%, but the month-on-month growth rate is as high as fell back to 2.5%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/xRkvb8zHmC6C3DeBwVYm8OZgI2258FRbjRTPtyvC.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;866&quot; height= &quot;1256&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/xRkvb8zHmC6C3DeBwVYm8OZgI2258FRbjRTPtyvC.png&quot; data-key=&quot;254393&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second central bank The quarterly monetary policy implementation report shows that at the end of June, the balance of personal housing loans of major financial institutions across the country (including foreign capital) was 38.6 trillion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 0.7%, and the first year-on-year negative growth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Affected by the surge in non-performing loan balances and the stagnant growth rate of loan scale that turned negative, the non-performing rate of personal housing loans has increased significantly since 2022. At the end of June 2023, the average non-performing rate of personal housing loans of 10 listed banks was 0.48%, an increase of 0.15 percentage points from the end of 2021, an increase of 45%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/NQmLmbhwYwxG4bFDzfczeQ3Sx8h5E3JKG42Jh7Lw.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height= &quot;807&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/NQmLmbhwYwxG4bFDzfczeQ3Sx8h5E3JKG42Jh7Lw.png&quot; data-key=&quot;254390&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend New Researchers from the Financial Research Center believe that despite the rapid growth in the scale and non-performing ratio of personal housing loans, compared with other types of credit, personal housing loans are still high-quality assets of commercial banks and will continue to be an important part of each bank&#39;s personal loan business. focus. At the same time, the central bank and other ministries and commissions have successively introduced new housing loan policies and continued to loosen restrictions on the real estate industry. The asset quality of personal housing loan business is expected to stabilize in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Credit card business&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Facing test&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In addition to personal mortgage business, credit card business is also the strategic focus of commercial banks. How does it perform? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center comparatively analyzed the interim reports of 13 commercial banks that disclosed the quality of credit card loans and found that the credit card business has seen multiple trend changes since 2022. First, two important indicators recorded negative growth for the first time on record. Among them, at the end of 2022, the cumulative number of credit cards issued was approximately 798 million, showing negative growth for the first time on record; the outstanding credit balance of credit cards was 8.69 trillion yuan, a year-on-year increase of only 0.9%, which was significantly higher than the average annual growth rate of 8% between 2019 and 2021. decline. As of the end of June 2023, the outstanding credit balance of credit cards of 13 listed banks (the scale of credit card business accounts for about 85% of the total scale of the banking industry) was 7.44 trillion yuan, a decrease of about 23 billion yuan from the end of 2022, which was also the first time on record. decline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/qXTZyLm4Jp5VkvruSTMPMIke1OrjoVv0qlP6trKz.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;866&quot; height= &quot;948&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/qXTZyLm4Jp5VkvruSTMPMIke1OrjoVv0qlP6trKz.png&quot; data-key=&quot;254391&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is credit card The quality of business assets is facing tests. As of the end of June 2023, the total non-performing balance of credit card accounts receivable of 13 commercial banks reached 148.2 billion yuan, slightly exceeding personal housing loans with a limit of 4 billion yuan. Following the 2020 interim report, it has once again become the personal loan business with the largest non-performing loan. . Correspondingly, the average non-performing loan ratio of credit card receivables of 13 banks is 2.29%, which is also a new high in the past three years after the 2020 mid-term report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 2020 to 2023, the asset quality pressure of commercial banks’ credit card business will increase significantly. Among them, the credit card non-performing loan balance and non-performing loan ratio reached two peaks in June 2020 and June 2023 respectively, with the peak in June 2020 being slightly higher than that in June 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/qvLU5C5MBUN8RwU1n1rx3wRdeUZ27SX1hjcSuiRj.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;866&quot; height= &quot;1161&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/qvLU5C5MBUN8RwU1n1rx3wRdeUZ27SX1hjcSuiRj.png&quot; data-key=&quot;254392&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend New Researchers from the Financial Research Center further studied the two peaks and found that the peak of credit card non-performing in June 2020 was mainly due to the sudden impact of the epidemic on household and personal balance sheets, superimposed on the factors of untimely repayment caused by restricted movement of people during the epidemic; During the period when the epidemic is calming down, the balance of non-performing loans and non-performing loans of commercial banks&#39; credit cards have tended to fall, but the low point of the decline is still significantly higher than before the epidemic. Since 2023, commercial banks have responded to regulatory requirements and no longer blindly compete for land, but have turned to intensive cultivation and prudent credit extension. The growth of credit card issuance volume, credit scale, unfinished credit scale and other indicators has significantly slowed down or even experienced negative growth. This has also led to a high non-performing rate in credit card business. However, as banks continue to implement prudent strategies, credit card non-performing rates are expected to fall. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Which banks&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; “&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;optimize”&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; bad disclosures? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The two indicators of non-performing loan balance and non-performing ratio are the most important and most sensitive indicators to measure the quality of credit assets. Which commercial banks have the courage to conduct complete and comprehensive information disclosure on the quality of their credit assets? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The comparative study of this item by researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center is mainly based on whether 20 listed banks disclose information on corporate loans by industry and region, and whether the industry and region of non-performing loans are separately Disclosure: When disclosing the components of personal loans, including personal housing loans, consumer loans, operating loans, and credit card loan balances, proportions, and growth rates, whether the corresponding non-performing loan balances and non-performing ratios are disclosed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The study found that in terms of the quality of information disclosure on non-performing loans, the level of disclosure of 20 listed banks varied. Large state-owned banks basically disclosed the above information at the same time. Only Bank of China stated &quot;non-performing&quot; as &quot;impairment&quot; in its annual report, which may easily cause certain misunderstandings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the national joint-stock banks, China Merchants Bank has the most complete disclosure of non-performing loans, while other joint-stock banks have more or less &quot;optimized&quot; non-performing loan-related data according to their own needs when disclosing. Typical &quot;optimization&quot; methods include setting personalized &quot;caliber&quot;. For example, when disclosing the industry distribution of non-performing loans, some banks do not directly disclose the non-performing loan balance and non-performing ratio data of each industry. However, through other relevant data disclosed by the bank, the distribution of non-performing loans in different industries of the bank can be estimated; For another example, when disclosing the non-performing status of personal housing loans, some banks merged this business with other personal loan businesses with certified mortgages; in addition, when disclosing the regional distribution of non-performing loans, 6 of the 9 joint-stock banks were based on the Yangtze River Delta A total of 6 regions are divided and disclosed, including the Pearl River Delta, the Bohai Rim, the central region, the western region and the northeastern region. However, Ping An Bank and Zheshang Bank divide the country into 4 regions; Industrial Bank divides the country into 4 regions based on geographical regions. The city, province or other important city where the headquarters is located is listed and disclosed separately; individual banks will also fine-tune the provinces under a certain region, making it difficult to make horizontal and vertical comparisons of the regional distribution of the bank&#39;s credit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some banks disclose weaker asset quality for retail loans than for corporate loans. Among the 20 listed banks, 13 banks directly disclosed or indirectly disclosed the distribution of personal loans in their interim reports. However, extending to 2020 and previous annual reports and interim reports, only about 10 banks disclosed the asset quality of personal loans. As a leading city commercial bank, Bank of Beijing has disclosed neither the industry distribution nor the regional distribution of non-performing loans in its previous annual reports and interim reports. It has disclosed the least asset quality among the 20 listed banks. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The frequency of mentions of &quot;bad&quot; in financial reports can also be used as an indication of the bank&#39;s credit disclosure adequacy in terms of loan quality. Statistics from researchers at Southern Weekend&#39;s New Finance Research Center found that China Merchants Bank was mentioned as &quot;non-performing&quot; the most in the 2023 interim report, a total of 94 times, while the Bank of Jiangsu was mentioned the least often, only 19 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/J7abSO8kN5QkX9C1NLM6v82mZMTFhd5f379OI0nj.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;866&quot; height= &quot;1161&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/J7abSO8kN5QkX9C1NLM6v82mZMTFhd5f379OI0nj.png&quot; data-key=&quot;254397&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;True and accurate , completeness, timeliness and fairness are the principle requirements for the information disclosure of listed companies. Standardization, easy to understand and easy to obtain are the basic requirements for the form of information disclosure of listed companies. According to this, a researcher at the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center believes that listed systemically important banks are the benchmark for China&#39;s banking industry and should also be the benchmark for information disclosure in the banking industry. Annual reports and annual reports should be based on various requirements for information disclosure by listed companies. The disclosure of important information such as interim reports is strictly controlled. In particular, indicators related to bank asset quality and their changes have attracted more attention from investors and the public. Listed banks should disclose true, accurate, complete, timely and fair information, and ensure that the disclosed information is standardized. , easy to understand and obtain, and continuously improve the compliance and transparency of corporate governance of listed banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 18 Oct 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[挑选、比较和竞争：2024届毕业生的第一场双选会]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258798]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-18 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/nuifKPmtNwPXYFAsfecCAyNOTckvwqHubxbDX1D2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1103&quot; height=&quot;825&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/nuifKPmtNwPXYFAsfecCAyNOTckvwqHubxbDX1D 2. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254348&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;September 26, 2023, Guangzhou, after the double selection meeting on Jinan University . &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Ke Yule/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The lights were all bright in the thousands-square-meter gymnasium, and 28 tables were arranged in a circle. The tabletop is covered with blue velvet, and beside each table stands a promotional poster as tall as one person. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At noon on September 20, 2023, at the Wushan Campus of South China University of Technology in Guangzhou, in half an hour, the special double election meeting for Shenzhen state-owned enterprises will begin. This is the third &quot;double selection meeting&quot; prepared by this 985 university for the 2024 graduates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The topic of employment for graduates in 2023 is still hot, and the school recruitment season for 2024 has begun again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Owen Xin, a senior student in our school’s School of Business Administration, has been waiting on the sidelines for a long time.

According to data released by the Ministry of Education, the number of college graduates in 2024 is expected to reach 11.87 million, reaching a new high, an increase of 290,000 from 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Double selection usually means the beginning of the new school recruitment season. This is a traditional recruitment form that directly invites companies to join the school to achieve offline face-to-face communication and two-way selection between companies and job-seeking students. Every step and every person leading to the workplace is surrounded by selection, comparison and competition. As policies, markets, and employment concepts change, the status of academic qualifications, majors, industries, and positions has also changed several times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the last 10 days of September 2023, Southern Weekend reporters visited a total of four double selection meetings of varying sizes in three schools in Guangzhou. At the same time, the autumn double elections across the country started almost simultaneously. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/4wWcEH5Zs4GaAgWB8hTaoLK5fs6suv19ltDQOTDQ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1106&quot; height= &quot;827&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/4wWcEH5Zs4GaAgWB8hTaoLK5fs6suv19ltDQOTDQ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254350&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 20, 2023, in Guangzhou, the theme of the South China University of Technology was the double selection meeting for the 2024 campus recruitment of Shenzhen state-owned enterprises. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Ke Yule/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Enterprises that are in trouble&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;They are not You know, our company is very good.” Wang Ming, the head of human resources at a state-owned real estate company in Shenzhen, complained at the Chinese Workers’ Dual Election Meeting on September 20. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public information shows that the group was founded in 1989 and went public three years later. It is mainly engaged in real estate development and operations and is directly managed by the Shenzhen Municipal State-owned Assets Supervision Bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This state-owned enterprise is well prepared. Most companies present only sent two personnel, while they sent three. But obviously, the extra manpower was not put to much use. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There were very few inquiries. When he was bored, Wang Ming took two photos. One picture is of another company, with four or five students queuing up in front of the booth, waiting for consultation; the other picture is of their own booth, with two HRs staring blankly in front of no one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Ming’s group is not the only company that has faced the cold shoulder in this double election. Even if they are state-owned enterprises and some established real estate companies, they have been left out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Around 2010, the golden age of the real estate industry, they were also a popular unit in the double election. &quot;The real estate industry has been in decline since two or three years ago.&quot; HR from one of the companies said frankly, &quot;Many students majoring in civil engineering and architecture have chosen to change industries, and students who intend to find employment in the real estate industry are also more cautious.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>; &quot;Fortunately, good policies have been introduced.&quot; Wang Ming said, taking out his mobile phone and showing the &quot;internal information&quot; he had obtained. The screenshot with black text on a white background mentioned that some districts in Guangzhou will completely cancel property purchase restrictions. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Soon, the &quot;inside information&quot; was publicly confirmed. On the afternoon of the same day, Guangzhou issued the &quot;Notice of the General Office of the Guangzhou Municipal People&#39;s Government on Optimizing Policies for the Stable and Healthy Development of the City&#39;s Real Estate Market&quot; - Guangzhou became the first city among the first-tier cities in the country to partially relax purchase restrictions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a long time in the past, the three industries of Internet, real estate, and education were known as the “Three Giants of School Recruitment” due to their large number of school recruitment positions and strong talent absorption capabilities. Zhaopin Recruitment Job Demand Data It shows that in 2021, the three giants jointly provided 56% of positions for fresh graduates. In the same year, the situation changed. Due to various reasons, the three giants frequently laid off employees, and the motivation for school recruitment was also insufficient. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If real estate practitioners can still see some opportunities from policy changes, the education and training industry still does not know what the future holds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;HR Deng Wenqing of a well-known education and training institution considers herself to be very &quot;hardworking&quot;. Since September, as the company&#39;s human resources representative in Guangzhou, she has participated in three double-election meetings. &quot;I was basically the last one to leave.&quot; Another double selection meeting on September 26 was originally scheduled to end at 5 p.m. Deng Wenqing sat until 5:30. Whenever a student stopped in front of the booth, she enthusiastically handed over the brochure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But her diligence cannot eliminate the impact of the education and training reform two years ago. An economics master&#39;s student stopped when passing by the booth and asked bluntly: &quot;Is this unrestricted? Does the state not care?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deng Wenqing repeated the explanation: &quot;The double reduction is for compulsory education and make-up classes. We only focus on high school subjects in this area, and focus on comprehensive quality training in junior high schools and below, without restrictions.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In another double selection meeting at the same time, it was also necessary to explain to the students that another tutor The HR of training institutions also adopts basically the same statement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Going back to July 2021, the &quot;double reduction&quot; curtain has begun. In one year, subject-based off-campus training institutions across the country have been reduced by more than 90%, and 25 related listed companies have announced that 100% of them will no longer engage in subject-based training in the compulsory education stage. In the past two years, in order to reduce media exposure, Deng Wenqing&#39;s organization has been very low-key in its online recruitment promotions. During the campus recruitment season, HR in various places has turned to offline recruitment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Few people talk about the past glory of the education and training industry. In 2020, in the first quarter China job market sentiment report jointly launched by the China Employment Research Institute of Renmin University of China and Zhaopin Recruitment, the education and training industry once ranked first, surpassing the Internet and e-commerce. That year, a leading company launched a spring campus recruitment of 3,000 people, and several online education institutions that became famous that year had a total recruitment of nearly 10,000 people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the double selection meeting on September 20, Deng Wenqing received a total of 12 resumes, and the master of economics who raised the question finally took away a brochure and promised to go back and read it again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/ZNG7TVhz66mAOhmQdv116Q8TSI1419OqX1BnAGIj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1246&quot; height= &quot;932&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/ZNG7TVhz66mAOhmQdv116Q8TSI1419OqX1BnAGIj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254351&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 26, 2023, in Guangzhou, at the double selection meeting on the campus of Jinan University, many graduates gathered in front of the booth of a new materials company. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Ke Yule/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Two-way selection&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Taking Guangzhou as an example, usually Throughout the entire employment season, more than 200 double selection meetings will be held from September to June of the following year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Enterprise recruitment is nothing more than online and offline channels. Online, some recruitment information is posted on the employment website or employment official account. Offline is information sessions and this kind of (double selection) Job fair.&quot; Xu Yang, the project manager of a school recruitment human resources company in Guangzhou introduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a human resources service platform focusing on campus recruitment. According to the official website, the platform has reached cooperation with more than 50 universities, hosts more than 200 offline dual selection meetings every year, and has provided services to a total of 206,000 companies. Three of the four double-election meetings visited by Southern Weekend reporters were hosted by this platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Usually, a regular double selection meeting is jointly organized by a university and a human resources company. The school provides the venue and student source data, and the human resources company is responsible for connecting with the company, arranging the venue, etc. Xu Yang said that in the offline format, the double selection meeting is more effective than the information session. Dozens to hundreds of companies are present at the same time. &quot;It will be more efficient in solving employment needs, and the school also recognizes the double selection meeting.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for recruitment efficiency, the most intuitive thing for companies is the on-site consultation situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Feng is running for the double election in his second year. He is the person in charge of the Guangzhou branch of a civil service examination training institution. The institution has only been established for three years. The training business covers civil servants, selected students, public institutions, etc., full-time There are less than 20 lecturers, and it can only be considered a small and micro enterprise in terms of scale. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But on the afternoon of September 28, in front of the teaching building of Guangdong University of Foreign Studies, next to Wu Feng’s booth, there were almost no interruptions in the number of students who came to consult. This day is approaching the Mid-Autumn Festival and the National Day holiday, so there are not many students participating in the double selection meeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Feng has several copies of &quot;Real Questions for the Written Examination for Selected Students in Guangdong&quot; on his desk. The slogan &quot;Scan the QR code to get it&quot; attracted many students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The public examination is more popular now.” Wu Feng knew that his company had taken advantage of the popularity of the public examination and the postgraduate entrance examination. For many fresh graduates who have not thought clearly about their way out, the iron rice bowl is undoubtedly the &quot;certain way out.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, even if the &quot;public examination&quot; is popular, not every time you participate in the double selection meeting, it will be so smooth. Wu Feng mentioned that in the fall of 2022, he went to Sun Yat-sen University to participate in the double selection meeting, but the results were not satisfactory. &quot;Our company is smaller, and those students may prefer big companies more.&quot; This year, the Sun Yat-sen University stop was canceled on his recruiting schedule. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a longer time dimension, school enrollment retention rate also determines corporate recruitment decisions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huang Li, HR of a news website in Foshan, has participated in the double selection meeting for four years. It is planned that this year she will go to Guangzhou University, Guangdong University of Foreign Studies and other universities to recruit, but the journalism and communication major ranks high A well-known university in the province is not among them. The reason lies in the recruitment retention rate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huang Li remembers that in the spring recruitment of 2021, her employer recruited four boys in the same dormitory from this university. After a month, &quot;all left.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Among the four people, some have returned to their hometowns, some have taken the civil service exam, and some have taken the professional education exam.” Huang Li added, “Re-recruitment also requires training, which is time-consuming and costly. I don’t want to recruit students from this university anymore.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Companies choose schools and are also chosen by schools. &quot;If it is an unknown company with only 10 or 20 people, it will definitely not be accepted. This is irresponsible to the company itself. If they come here, they will not be able to recruit people.&quot; Jinan University double selection on the afternoon of September 26 At the meeting, another person in charge of the aforementioned school recruitment platform revealed that the school will have certain requirements for participating companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Take JNU as an example. What it requires must be well-known companies. For example, how many of China’s top 500 companies, how many of the world’s top 500 companies, what is the salary range, and the academic qualifications suitable for the position (is it Bachelor&#39;s degree and above), these requirements will be met.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some double selection sessions will limit the themes and gather certain types of companies into one session. For example, the double selection meeting held at South China University of Technology on September 20 was aimed at Shenzhen state-owned enterprises, and the double selection meeting held at Guangdong University of Technology on September 26 was aimed at the micro-semiconductor industry. On September 27, another dual-selection meeting held by South China University of Technology gathered more than 200 companies, focusing on recruiting high-level talents in education, scientific research, and medical and health fields that are urgently needed and in short supply in key fields in Guangxi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/qtrfGww6PZYUh5QeAOt4dU8buB8BgmmdxraDhFZQ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1236&quot; height= &quot;924&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/qtrfGww6PZYUh5QeAOt4dU8buB8BgmmdxraDhFZQ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254349&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 27, 2023, in Guangzhou, the Guangxi-themed double-election meeting on the campus of South China University of Technology carried the slogan &quot;I want to go to Guangxi&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Ke Yule/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Supply and demand issues&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In order to participate in the event on September 27 For the double selection meeting of South China University of Technology, Li Jiamin, a master&#39;s student majoring in materials science at Sun Yat-sen University, specially set out from Shenzhen and took the school bus for nearly two hours to arrive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her enthusiasm dropped by half after entering school. Different from the double-election meeting a week ago, this time the venue was outdoors, crowded, noisy and hot, and corporate leaflets scattered everywhere were trampled under people&#39;s feet. Soon, she was sitting next to the wall to rest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Jiamin graduated from a college in Shanxi three years ago. She concentrated on preparing for the postgraduate entrance examination and &quot;went a lot of effort&quot; to get into the CUHK. When enrolling as a graduate student, her supervisor told her and her classmates not to go to graduate school just to improve their academic qualifications and find a job. But Li Jiamin was not convinced, &quot;The facts are there. The starting salary of graduate students is higher than that of undergraduate students. Everyone thinks so.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before participating in this double election meeting, she specifically inquired about industry salaries. Others told her that in Shenzhen, a monthly salary of less than 20,000 yuan for a master&#39;s degree in materials science is considered low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很长一段时间里，每位填报志愿时了无头绪的理工科同学都会心照不宣地默记同一条口诀，“生化环材，四大天坑”。刻板印象中，它们是钱少、活累、竞争激烈的代名词。但在碳达峰、碳中和等政策指向下，传统行业向新材料、新能源、半导体、智能制造业转型，应届毕业生年薪三十万的故事已不算罕见。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但这天的双选会还是让她小小失望了。 “（企业开出的月薪）都在一万五至一万七左右，比我的预期低很多。”她带来了六份简历，临走还剩了几份。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从事校园招聘工作四年来，许洋观察到，双选会上的人岗供需不对称的情况越发突出。一方面，学生就业积极性不断提高，与会人数攀升；另一方面，参会企业的数量和释出的岗位却在减少。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“企业的需求是受大环境影响的。2021年我们在广外办的双选会，有一百多家企业参加，但今天只有不到60 家。”9月28日，在广东外语外贸大学的双选会现场，许洋这么说起。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在许洋看来，不对称的供需关系对就业形势的影响有好有坏。 “好的方面是对企业而言，招的人变少了，来的学生却很多，企业可以有更多机会挑选到合适的人。但同学们找工作的确变难了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;9月28日下午，一名广东药科大学的女生结束了和吴峰的面谈，停在展位前逗留。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当被问到为何对公考机构感兴趣时，女生将南方周末记者拉到一旁，低声道，“可以一边兼职一边考公啊。”随即，她的神色又变得狐疑，“跟你说了，我还怎么找工作？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她的担忧也许是多余的。吴峰并不介意讲师同时自己备考公务员，相反，他对此很鼓励，在他看来，“有备考经历，工作上手才会比较快”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;吴峰更表示，到了面谈阶段，自己会直接建议求职者去备战公考，考完之后，再来确定初步意向和最终的入职复试。但说出这句话时，他皱着眉头，并未舒展开。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（王明、邓文晴、许洋、吴峰、黄丽、李嘉敏为化名）&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“我们科的医生基本上每天号都挂满，住院床位也非常紧张，有些小朋友可能要等好几天，才能住进来。”丁国栋是儿童呼吸科副主任医师，他和同事们这样超负荷的工作节奏，从9月中旬就开始了，“现阶段，儿童呼吸科的住院患儿中，几乎90%都是感染的肺炎支原体，而且耐药支原体占比很高”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;肺炎支原体直径50-300纳米，近乎人类头发丝直径的千分之一，是一种介于细菌和病毒之间的微生物。由这种微生物引起的肺炎，是中国5岁及以上儿童最主要的社区获得性肺炎（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;指在医院外罹患的感染性肺实质炎症&lt;/span>;），多发于秋冬季。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;自九月开学季以来，不止上海，北京、河北、江苏等多地医院都出现肺炎支原体患儿较多的情况，而且呈低龄化特点。据央视新闻10月13日报道，近期全国呼吸道感染性疾病发病率整体上升，肺炎支原体进入多发季，患儿需及时就医、对症用药。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“您前面有246位”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;10月15日下午四点前，秦楠楠终于给儿子挂上了号，此时北京儿童医院一位副主任医师的号已经排到第556号。候诊过程中，她发现有人已经拿到800多号。好不容易到了采血环节，秦楠楠拿到了第1310号，号码条上还贴心标明“您前面有246位”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;北京儿童医院呼吸科主任徐保平10月13日接受媒体采访中介绍，9月以来，该院发热咳嗽门诊的日接诊量在3000-4700人次，其中20%的病人支原体抗体检测为阳性。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;南方周末记者发现，院方特意在一面墙上贴着提示，“近期就诊患儿数量大幅上升，医院已经调配全院医护人员连续加班支援门诊，竭尽全力保证患儿就医需求，请您理解并耐心等候。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“北京儿童医院专门开了一个发热咳嗽的门诊，做得有点像方舱，另一边普通门诊也是一样人头攒动，当天光是抽血化验，我们就等了近两个半小时。”秦楠楠说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;同样长队的还有上海交通大学医学院附属新华医院。10月16日傍晚，接近下班时分，该院位于一楼的急诊和二楼的儿内科门诊，挤满了来看病的家长和孩子，找不到空座位的人只能暂时坐在走廊地上休息。这一天上海的气温只有20摄氏度左右，但不少人的汗水早已浸湿了额前的头发。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;新华医院的儿科全国闻名，外地来看病的人多，还有一些基层医院治不了就转诊来的病患。丁国栋对南方周末记者感叹，最近全院医护人员白天只要有空，都去门急诊支援，夜间都有很多医生留下来加班，看门急诊或者收患儿住院，“病人实在太多了”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;2023年10月12日晚，首都医科大学附属北京儿童医院输液中心，坐满了挂水的孩子和陪护的家长，咳嗽声此起彼伏。南方周末实习生习丽杰/摄&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;和一般的细菌性肺炎不同，由于肺炎支原体没有细胞壁，普通家庭所熟悉的青霉素和头孢，对肺炎支原体完全无效，原因是这类抗生素都是以细胞壁作为靶点。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;一般来说，大环内酯类抗菌药物，如阿奇霉素、红霉素，目前是肺炎支原体感染的首选治疗药物。但让许多儿科医生颇感棘手的是，耐药肺炎支原体感染的现象较为普遍，也就是说，用大环内酯类抗菌药物疗效不佳，甚至无效。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;国家卫健委在2023年2月发布的《儿童肺炎支原体肺炎诊疗指南（2023年版）》也指出，国内对大环内酯类抗菌药物耐药的感染较普遍，可能是导致重症肺炎支原体肺炎等发生的主要原因之一。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“耐药支原体的感染并不是今年才有的，好些年前就有了。”丁国栋主任告诉南方周末记者，他所在的儿童呼吸科病房主要是收治一些病情较重的患儿，这些患儿大多数做了耐药基因检测，结果显示，几乎90%都是耐药支原体感染。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023年发布在《中国病原生物学杂志》的一篇论文指出，近年来耐药株检出率越来越高，一项宁波地区2019-2021年住院儿童肺炎支原体感染研究显示，耐药率超70%。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;这样一来，临床医生需要根据患者病情和年龄，适当选用二线药物，比如四环素类抗菌药物（多西环素和米诺环素等）或者喹诺酮类的药物抗感染治疗，同时加用糖皮质激素抑制机体过强免疫炎症反应，减缓肺内、肺外的并发症进展和严重程度。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;此外，在当下气温变化较大的季节交替时期，合并感染对免疫力较差的孩子也是巨大的挑战。就在两三天前，丁国栋在病房查看的一个患儿，同时感染了耐药肺炎支原体、流感病毒、腺病毒，呼吸衰竭，情况十分危急，“同时合并感染多种病原体，一般会比单一感染要严重”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;因此，丁国栋提醒，除了保持卫生习惯，做好日常防护之外，现在正逢流感疫苗接种之际，家长可以带小朋友及时接种疫苗。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;流行何时休？&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;和新冠病毒感染类似的是，感染肺炎支原体并痊愈后，体内抗体水平随着时间推移而逐渐下降，存在再度感染的可能性。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;秦楠楠的儿子7岁了，这不是他2023年第一次感染肺炎支原体，在这波流行季前已经得过一次，所以家里人没有太过于慌乱，心里对孩子的症状表现比较有数。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;10月12日，北京疾控中心在其官方微信号发文称，肺炎支原体感染可全年发生，北京地区每年8月到12月是肺炎支原体感染的高发期，一般在每年11月左右达到高峰。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“肺炎支原体是北京地区急性呼吸道感染的重要病原体。肺炎支原体分为I型和II型共两种亚型，目前北京市主要流行亚型为I型。”该文表示。同时，根据北京疾控中心10月13日发布的疫情周报，手足口病是10月2日-8日那周报告发病数最高的传染病。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;对于生成式人工智能，国内监管几乎与技术发展同步，反映了对这一技术的高度重视。由国家网信办联合多部门出台的《生成式人工智能服务管理暂行办法》已于7月10日发布，自8月15日起施行，其第17条规定：提供具有舆论属性或者社会动员能力的生成式人工智能服务的，应当按照国家有关规定开展安全评估，并按照《互联网信息服务算法推荐管理规定》履行算法备案和变更、注销备案手续。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;目前，已有多家大模型通过备案，可正式上线面向公众提供服务，包括文心一言（百度）、云雀（抖音）、紫东太初（中科院）等。该办法第4条与第7条，分别对提供和使用生成式人工智能服务及对模型进行数据训练提出了若干要求，涉及价值观与数据来源等多个方面。显然，正在征求意见中的《生成式人工智能服务安全基本要求》呼应并细化了这些规定。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;生成式人工智能有何特别与殊胜之处？想必大家听得耳朵都起茧了。目前，某些生成式人工智能如GPT-4或已跨入通用人工智能（Artificial General Intelligence, AGI）的门槛。而AGI翻成“通用人工智能”其实有一定误导性，因为General Intelligence指的是“一般智力”，让孩子测智商，做排除了特定语言与文化影响的瑞文矩阵（Raven&#39;s Matrices）试题，测出来的就是这个“一般智力”。 AGI意味着，通过人工方法，大模型实现了可与人类心智媲美的“一般智力”。微软科学家们的论文显示：GPT-4 的智能非常接近人类水平。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是一个革命性的突破。此类企近或达到AGI的大模型，哪怕长期稳定在一个相当于人类中等智力水平上，它的学习能力也是任何人类都望尘莫及的：可以学习人类创造与积累的所有显性知识，任何以文字、图片、音频与视频呈现的知识它都可以掌握。这意味着大量人类中的知识工作可以被此类生成式人工智能所替代，如翻译与外语口语老师。这会在多大程度上重塑我们的生产与生活方式，是大家都在关切与深思的问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，生成式人工智能持什么价值观，是绕不过去的一个问题。我们每个人都有价值观。我们为什么有这样的价值观，既取决于基因与其他先天禀赋，也取决于后天的教养与习染。同理，如果不加任何干预，生成式人工智能的“价值观”就取决于给它喂的语料，更多地给它喂浸渍某种价值观的语料，它就会更多地呈现该种价值观。如果在先给它人为设置了某种特定价值观，那么它就会秉持这种价值观，就会排斥与负面解读与它价值观不一致的语料。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从GPT的早期版本来看，这种特征已经出现。一个经典的例子是：要求它给拜登写一首赞美诗，它欣然同意，且写得很肉麻；要求它给特朗普写一首赞美诗，它断然拒绝，表示要“政治中立”。这背后是开发它的人持有这些价值观，既可以给它在先设置特定价值观，也可以给它喂浸渍特定价值观的语料，从而实现对生成式人工智能的价值观塑造。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，在众目睽睽之下，开发者会尽可能隐藏生成式人工智能的价值观，而采取一种言语上“不得罪任何人、不冒犯任何人”的策略，听起来挑不出什么毛病，这种策略本身也是某种特定价值观的反映。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;再畅想一下，现在的生成式人工智能相当于只有大脑、没有可自由移动的有形身体，就像一个灵魂飘荡在赛博空间。如果将来把这一灵魂“注入”仿生机器人甚至行动能力上远超人类身体的智能机器人，那对人类社会的冲击与潜在危害就更大了。人类真的能有效驾驭它们，令它们只造福而不危害人类吗？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;科幻作家阿西莫夫设定过机器人三定律：机器人不得伤害人类，或坐视人类受到伤害；除非违背第一定律，否则机器人必须服从人类命令；除非违背第一或第二定律，否则机器人必须保护自己。这恐怕只是一厢情愿。未来具备AGI的智能机器人，完全可能被输入或“自行进化”出反人类的价值观，令文明与人类的存续岌岌可危；或者某些持扭曲价值观的个人或组织将具备AGI的智能机器人武器化，消灭别的民族或种族或其所讨厌的群体。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;故而，我们现阶段讨论：生成式人工智能现在能干什么、将来能干什么？应该持什么价值观？对我们生产与生活方式会有多大及哪方面的冲击？人类能否有效驾驭它？会对文明与人类存续本身构成多大挑战？这些问题都是有意义的，也与地球上现在及未来的每一个人利害攸关。这不是杞人忧天，而是未雨绸缪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 18 Oct 2023 16:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“加沙没有安全的地方”，巴以厮杀循环何时休]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258796]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-18 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/YjXrbrguwqGdYd7GdGeoQGSkoPy41PzHdCLMiDOB.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;2023年10月14日晚上，联合国近东巴勒斯坦难民救济和工程处（以下简称“近东救济工程处”）工作人员给南方周末记者发来消息，推迟与通讯主任茱莉亚·图马的采访。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就在前一天，该机构宣布，“由于以色列增加对加沙地带的袭击”，已将其运营中心和工作人员迁至加沙地带南部，继续支持加沙地带的巴勒斯坦难民。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而据联合国人道主义事务协调办公室（OCHA）10月17日发表声明称，在加沙遇难的人道主义工作人员已增至31人。声明表示，加沙已经连续第六天“全面停电”。加沙医院正处于崩溃的边缘，用于运行备用发电机的燃料储备几乎完全耗尽，这将危及数千名患者的生命。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此前两天的15日早上，以色列国防军发言人乔纳森·康里库斯在社交媒体上发布一段视频，再次向加沙北部居民发出了警告，令该地区的巴勒斯坦人逃往南部。之前以色列军方也向加沙发出类似的撤离令。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这场暴力厮杀，在循环中持续扩大。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在以色列连日的反扑行动下，如今的加沙街区已变得面目全非，四处可见残垣断壁，建筑已成废墟一片。惶恐之中，很多加沙居民踏上了逃难之旅。&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我们每天都在目睹死亡。”当地人赛义德·修艾布在社交媒体写道。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;目前，以色列已经对加沙地带实行全面封锁，包括断供水、电和煤气，关闭各通行口岸，并轰炸通往埃及的拉法口岸，导致其基础设施无法正常工作。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随着当地人道主义危机迅速加深，联合国多个机构纷纷发出严厉警告。“近东救济工程处”负责人菲利普·拉扎里表示，加沙正在“迅速变成地狱”，濒临崩溃。他敦促所有各方，“结束这场悲剧”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年10月16日，国家国际发展合作署新闻发言人徐伟表示，中方正向联合国近东巴勒斯坦难民救济和工程处及巴民族权力机构分别提供紧急人道主义援助，用于解决加沙地带食品、医疗、居住等急需。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随着巴以新一轮冲突持续，双方死伤人数也在不断上升。截至当地时间10月15日，冲突已造成双方超4100人死亡。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上海国际问题研究院外交政策研究所研究员李伟建向南方周末记者表示，以色列的“报复行动”将会持续一段时间。“哈马斯的行动对以色列来说是羞辱，因此以色列需要得到心理平衡。”他认为，以色列会借这次力量，定时清除哈马斯。“事实上他已经在做这件事情。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“城市巷战”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“近东救济工程处”实习生吴晨雨10月12日收到邮件，上面显示“机构（加沙办公室）有11名工作人员遇难。”尽管已经知道了这个消息，但她仍然感觉到非常难过。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;吴晨雨是该机构约旦办公室实习生。她告诉南方周末记者，该机构总部管理5个实地办公室，分别是黎巴嫩、加沙、西岸、叙利亚和约旦。她所在的约旦救济处，暂时还没有受到战火波及，“但是其它实地办公室如加沙，工作人员被通知要撤离。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;10月14日晚些时候，哈马斯向以色列特拉维夫及周边地带、中部城市巴特亚姆、南部城市阿什凯隆等地发起火箭弹袭击。外界分析，巴以双方谁都无法具体预测地面战会出现什么情形。哈马斯在以往巴以冲突中已经证明自身能够生存，并拥有“适合巷战的强力武器”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;哈马斯下属武装派别卡桑旅在14日向以色列军方发布信息称，该组织已经为以军“任何地面军事行动”做好“充分的应对准备”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;加沙地带面积约360平方公里，人口密集、房屋林立。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此前，哈马斯声称已修建长达500公里的隧道。不少专家学者分析认为，隧道网络会放大巷战难度，一旦以军和哈马斯在那里展开“城市巷战”，双方都会遭受比本轮巴以冲突头几天更高的伤亡，并对以军队构成致命威胁。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“加沙地带一共有两层，一层是平民的，另一层是哈马斯的。”以色列国防军发言人10月12日表示，这些隧道只是哈马斯的“掩体”，这样他们就可以继续策划跨境行动，并向以色列发射火箭弹。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不少媒体报道披露，这条“迷宫般的巨大地下隧道网络”修建在加沙地下30米深处，入口隐藏在房屋、学校及其他公共建筑的底层，用于哈马斯运送人员、物资，储存弹药等，同时躲避以色列的炮弹和侦察。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;过去几天，以色列不断对加沙发动空袭。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但冲突爆发一周后，哈马斯仍能向以色列发射火箭弹。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;外界认为，这是因为被隐藏在地道里的火箭弹可以随时移动。哈马斯军事领导人之一萨利赫·阿鲁里在本轮巴以冲突爆发前曾说过的话，“哈马斯的防守方案比进攻方案更强有力。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我不认为以色列士兵有能力袭击这些隧道。”特拉维夫大学中东和非洲研究中心的巴勒斯坦历史学家沙乌勒表示，但以方“会找到把哈马斯熏出来的方法。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;浙江外国语学院环地中海研究院院长马晓霖认为，以色列不能也不会彻底消灭哈马斯。他说，哈马斯由小到大，不乏以色列纵其壮大以对抗巴解组织主流派的“功劳”。保留加沙地带作为所谓的“哈马斯坦”，可以继续分裂、弱化、内耗巴勒斯坦阵营，而让以色列战略受益。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;报复与顾忌&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“怎么也想不到，这趟旅途竟是如此。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;已经从以色列顺利回到中国的饶萍曼，回想起逃离以色列的场景，彷佛就在昨天。在特拉维夫机场等待15小时后，10月8日上午，饶女士登上了从特拉维夫到埃塞俄比亚的飞机，随后经埃塞俄比亚-曼谷-香港路线回到中国。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与此同时，作为对哈马斯的报复，以军已对加沙地带发动多轮空袭。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以色列国防军10月16日下午公开表示，哈马斯情报局局长在以军的一次暗杀行动中被打死。目前，哈马斯方面对此暂无回应。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以色列国防军还在一份声明中称，以军完成了数十万名预备役军人的动员，后勤部门正努力确保地面部队的武器装备供应。并表示战斗所需的装备已经转移到集结区。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为“反扑”行动，以色列的行动可称”全方位”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;10月14日，以色列国防军宣布将对加沙地带实施更为广泛的地面军事行动计划，扩大对加沙地带的攻势，包括发起“空中、海上和陆地的联合协调攻击”。以色列总理内塔尼亚胡此前威胁称，以军将通过地面攻势“摧毁哈马斯”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以色列国防军表示，以军士兵正在进行“重大地面行动”的准备工作，以军将对加沙地带实施“广泛的地面进攻计划”来扩大攻势，包括实施“空中、海上和陆地联合协调攻击”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李伟建认为，此时以色列的心态，并非决心要打“胜负”战，而是以色列认为这次受到的损失太大，所以一定要哈马斯付出代价，加倍的要报复。“这种心态之下，以色列一定会在报复方面做得更多。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;10月12日夜间至13日凌晨，以军对加沙地带哈马斯和其他组织的约750个目标进行了空袭。其中包括隧道、军事大院、用作高级成员军事指挥中心的住宅、武器仓库、通讯室以及12栋藏有哈马斯资产的建筑。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而就在那前一天的11日，以色列总理本杰明·内塔尼亚胡在当夜发表了电视讲话，他发誓要“粉碎和摧毁”哈马斯武装分子，并称该组织的每个成员都是“死人”。以军还袭击了哈马斯在加沙地带的两个军事基地。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在其中一处大院中，哈马斯北部师指挥官的总部被摧毁，哈马斯海军部队一座的军事基础设施也遭到袭击。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以色列国防军表示,自10月7日本轮巴以冲突发生以来,以军已在约旦河西岸逮捕了超过330名巴勒斯坦人，其中包括百余名与哈马斯有关的人员。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，不少专家学者告诉南方周末记者，以色列的“反扑”行动不会无限扩大。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;马晓霖判断，被以色列人称为“马蜂窝”和“该死地带”的加沙地带，一旦纳入版图，以色列将再次背负沉重的国际法、道义、舆论、经济、人口结构和安全负担，也将断送已取得重大进展的与阿拉伯国家和解进程。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“以色列也有很多顾忌的地方。”李伟建分析，如果以色列过度造成人道主义危机，或者是杀害了很多平民，最终也会激发阿拉伯世界的愤怒。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“互相伤害”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;以色列“撤离令”发布后，加沙北部的居民开始纷纷逃往南部，寻找庇护的地方。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在社交媒体流传的视频中，乌泱泱的居民将随身携带的物品，塞进皮卡车、汽车。还有一些居民，不得不挤在牲畜拉着的平板车上，艰难地移动着。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也有一些居民拒绝离开，守在已经倒塌残破的房屋中。面对镜头，他们表示，尽管家园可能充满危险，但离开是“背弃土地和历史”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在新一轮冲突爆发后，赛义德·修艾布一家不得不从靠近以色列边境的布雷伊难民营，来到代尔巴拉赫难民营。他在社交媒体上持续记录着。他表示，“加沙没有安全的地方。以色列告诉人们往南方去，但他们仍在南方轰炸。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在以色列的“封锁”之下，世界卫生组织发言人贾萨瑞维奇表示加沙的医院正在耗尽医疗用品和床位。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;联合国人道主义事务协调厅10月13日发布消息，称新一轮巴以冲突爆发以来，加沙地带流离失所者人数已超过42万人。联合国机构呼吁筹款向加沙地带和约旦河西岸的巴勒斯坦人提供援助。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与此同时，以色列政府发布了“被哈马斯怪物杀害和焚烧婴儿的可怕照片”。这三张照片发布在内塔尼亚胡办公室的社交媒体账户上。但哈马斯否认了这些指控。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;目前已经逃到土耳其的杨然，在巴以冲突新一轮的冲突发生时，就带着行李搬进了以色列所在学校的庇护所。他告诉南方周末记者，那里水电和网络齐全，也比其他庇护所更安全。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“战场主要集中在南部，我所在的中部除了第一天几千发火箭弹，之后的火箭弹就减少了，甚至第二天公交火车都恢复了。”杨然透露，以色列人因为每年可能都会有一到两次火箭弹袭击，所以“比较习以为常”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“以色列经济损失的大小将取决于这些预备役人员离开工作岗位的时间。”以色列希伯来大学经济学教授埃亚尔·温特表示。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;自冲突爆发以来，以色列国防军征召了诸多预备役军人执行任务。这些预备役军人来自各行各业，他们脱离日常经济生产活动，投入战斗。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;多线作战”的泥潭&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;目前，以色列已全面“封锁”哈马斯控制的加沙地带，切断水电供应。此举让联合国担忧加沙地带人道主义危机加剧。联合国秘书长古特雷斯敦促各方，允许联合国向加沙地带提供人道主义援助。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为“两边忙”的美国，巴以冲突升级后“大动作”频频。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美国白宫10月16日发布消息称，美国总统拜登将于10月18日访问以色列后，前往约旦首都安曼，与约旦国王阿卜杜拉二世、埃及总统塞西和巴勒斯坦总统、巴勒斯坦民族解放运动（法塔赫）主席阿巴斯会面，商讨冲突相关事宜。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;10月14日，美国国防部长奥斯汀下令让“艾森豪威尔”号航母打击群前往东地中海。并表示，这是作为“努力遏制战争扩大的一部分”。拜登则公开表示，白宫正迅速“向以提供弹药和导弹拦截系统”等额外安全援助，他敦促美国国会，采取紧急行动批准资金，满足包括以色列在内美国“关键伙伴”的安全需求。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“美国派航母舰队为以色列站台，并威慑伊朗和真主党，但不会主动介入加沙战事而在中东四面树敌，更不想再陷中东泥潭。”浙江外国语学院环地中海研究院院长马晓霖说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而在此次冲突中，被外界猜测是哈马斯“支持者”的伊朗，则与哈马斯高层进行首次会面。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当地时间14日晚，伊朗外交部长阿卜杜拉希扬在卡塔尔首都多哈会见哈马斯领导人哈尼亚。他呼吁，以色列不要发动对加沙地带的地面进攻。并警告说，如果黎巴嫩真主党加入冲突，本轮冲突可能会进一步扩大到中东其他地区，这将使以色列遭受巨大损失。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这场暴力厮杀，究竟何时停止循环？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;哈马斯政治局成员马尔祖克10月10日表示，哈马斯“已经实现目标”，对讨论停火“类似事情”和“所有政治对话”持开放态度。卡塔尔半岛电视台网站报道称，哈马斯已经俘虏了足够数量的以色列军人，但哈马斯只有在战争结束后，才愿意商讨解决换俘的问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;值得关注的是，以色列与黎巴嫩边境地区也爆发冲突。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;黎巴嫩国家通讯社报道，当地时间10月15日，以色列对黎巴嫩南部边境小镇达希拉（Al-Dhahira）发起炮击，造成公共道路交通完全中断。外界普遍认为，如果黎以边境局势进一步升级，以色列可能在北部面临“第二条战线”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;马晓霖则表示，这场冲突主战场已转移到加沙地带，无论伤亡多大，战事不会溢出巴以黎叙四国。“加上沙特和伊朗元首为讨论巴以冲突而首次通话，这表明双方曾主导的地区身份政治博弈不会反复，巴勒斯坦问题或被继续边缘化。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“接下来，以色列还是会考虑到未来的发展。”李伟建分析，以色列要和中东国家和阿拉伯国家打交道，也希望能够维护好已经好不容易打开的局面，改善同其他国家关系的发展。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;外交部发言人毛宁呼吁，当务之急应是推动局势降温、停火止暴、保护平民，避免人道主义灾难。大国在处理国际地区热点问题时，应当坚持客观公正，保持冷静克制。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（应受访者要求，饶萍曼、杨然均为化名）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;
