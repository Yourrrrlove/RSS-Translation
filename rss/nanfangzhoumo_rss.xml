During the lighting ceremony, a giant &quot;digital man&quot; rushed from outside the venue and lit the main torch together with the real people present, bringing this technologically full opening ceremony to a climax. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s not just about digital people igniting fires. This opening ceremony can be said to be the opening ceremony of a sports meeting with the strongest sense of technology to date. A &quot;net screen&quot; with a total length of 185 meters and a height of 20 meters hangs in the air, and a 6,000-square-meter ground screen on the ground turns the &quot;Big Lotus&quot; of the Hangzhou Olympic Sports Center Stadium into a huge three-dimensional display screen. In addition, with the blessing of naked-eye 3D, AR and other digital technologies, the digital fireworks are dazzling, and the opening performance combines virtual and real scenes, giving it a full sense of the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the third time China has hosted the Asian Games in more than 30 years. The hosting of these three Asian Games also reflects the development process of China&#39;s economic society and national spiritual mentality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1990, the 11th Asian Games was held in Beijing. This was the first time that China hosted a large-scale international comprehensive sports event. It was also the early stage of China&#39;s reform and opening up. In 1983, China applied to host the Asian Games, hoping to show an image of openness to the outside world. Economically, China&#39;s development was just starting at that time. By 1990, when the Asian Games were held, the country&#39;s total GDP was only 1.89 trillion yuan, less than 360.9 billion U.S. dollars. Its per capita GDP ranked outside the 130th place in the world, and it was also the lowest in Asia. Not forward. At that time, even the preparations for the Asian Games lacked funds, so they had to launch a nationwide fundraising campaign. Tens of millions of people across the country participated and donated a total of 270 million yuan, more than one-tenth of the total investment in the Beijing Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second time China hosted the Asian Games was the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games. In the past 20 years, especially at the beginning of the new century, China&#39;s accession to the WTO and integration into the global market have made China the world&#39;s factory, and its economy has developed by leaps and bounds. Although affected by the financial crisis in 2008, China&#39;s economy quickly resumed development. In 2010, China&#39;s total GDP exceeded 40 trillion yuan, equivalent to more than 6 trillion US dollars, surpassing Japan for the first time, ranking first in Asia and second in the world. The Asian Games will be held in Guangzhou. Guangzhou has been a commercial capital for thousands of years and the forefront of reform and opening up. The Pearl River Delta is also the most active region for China&#39;s export-oriented economy and one of China&#39;s most important manufacturing and foreign trade bases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This time, the Hangzhou Asian Games has been more than ten years since the Guangzhou Asian Games. Over the past ten years, China&#39;s economy has nearly tripled. More importantly, the scientific and technological content of China&#39;s economy has also been greatly improved, especially in the field of digital economy, which leads the world. Hangzhou is the home base of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. The gorgeous digital people and digital fireworks at the opening ceremony of the Hangzhou Asian Games are a concentrated display of China&#39;s high-end digital technology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the attention attracted by these three Asian Games is also different. I believe older friends will have a better understanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the successful bid to the preparation and successful hosting of the Beijing Asian Games, it has attracted unprecedented attention from the whole country. I remember that televisions were not yet popular in China, especially in rural areas. Black and white TVs were rare, and color TVs were even rarer. In some villages, only the village committee had a color TV for villagers to watch. Farmers are busy with farm work during the day and have no time to watch the live broadcast of the Asian Games. At night, the color TV in the village committee is crowded with farmers watching the game. Of course, more news about the game was heard from the loudspeaker broadcast in the village the next morning. Every time there was news that the Chinese team had won, it would cause a burst of carnival. The emblem composed of the Great Wall pattern, the mascot panda Panpan, and the promotional song &quot;Asian Heroes&quot; have all become the memories of a generation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The opening ceremony of the Guangzhou Asian Games was ingenious and brilliant. The &quot;Sail of White Clouds&quot; showed a grand atmosphere of openness and pioneering. However, in terms of attention, I am afraid it cannot compare with the national participation of the Beijing Asian Games. the hot state. I came to Guangzhou from Beijing to work in October 2010, just before the Guangzhou Asian Games. Just two years ago, China just hosted the 2008 Olympic Games. All the top events in the world have been held, and the psychological threshold of the Chinese people has naturally increased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, mobile networks have become the main channel of communication. Everyone has a variety of short videos and news apps installed on their mobile phones. Even payment tools such as Alipay have video reports of the Asian Games. Information about the Asian Games can be received anytime and anywhere. In such a convenient communication environment, more than 100 million people participated in the Asian Games digital torch relay event. However, with the continuous evolution of lifestyles, we can no longer see the state where everyone sits in front of the TV. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The change in attention to the Asian Games is also an inevitable result of the development of China&#39;s economic society and national mentality. At the time of the Beijing Asian Games, China&#39;s economy was still relatively backward. The Asian Games was an opportunity to unite the strength of the Chinese people and show their national pride. The vigorous publicity by the official media made the Beijing Asian Games known to everyone. As for the Guangzhou Asian Games and this time the Hangzhou Asian Games, with the improvement of China&#39;s economic level, there have been countless world-class sports events held in China. Ordinary people also have more channels to access more information, and their attention is divided. Of course, this is also a good thing. Those who love sports will continue to pay attention to the Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third Asian Games in thirty years is a testimony to China’s development and the evolution of the national spirit. In this sense, the opening ceremony of the Asian Games has increased technological content and attracted less attention than it did in the past, which is a reflection of its richness, development and progress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 14:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“常·识”背后的南方报业融合转型密码]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257611]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25 14:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A few days ago, Huang Changkai, Secretary of the Party Committee and President of Southern Newspaper Media Group, wrote the monograph &quot;Common Knowledge - Southern The book &quot;Newspaper Media Convergence Comics&quot; was officially published by Nanfang Daily Publishing House. This is another professional masterpiece by the author following &quot;Communication Power - Media Integration Practice of Southern Newspaper Industry&quot;, which deeply summarizes the practice and experience of the integration transformation of southern newspapers and profoundly explains the understanding and understanding of the regularity of integration transformation of provincial party newspaper groups. Although the title of the book is &quot;Common Knowledge&quot;, it is closely combined with the extraordinary process of the southern newspaper industry in recent years to successfully explore the path of integrated development that is in line with the spirit of the central government, industry trends and with southern characteristics. It shows the southern newspaper people&#39;s perspective on media integration and transformation. Deep understanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/5b8d0c05c65e1a924c997e724b8104c4.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/5b8d0c05c65e1a924c997e724b8104c4.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252058&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Book and video of &quot;Common Knowledge - Comics on the Integration of Southern Newspaper and Media&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Looking at integration transformation from eight sets of dialectical relationships&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;:&lt;/span >;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Without communication power, there is nothing&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the era of mobile Internet, how to promote the development of media integration is a question of the times and also of contemporary media. A must-answer question for people&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;. Media integration is a systematic project that involves &lt;span>;&lt;/span>;innovation of ideas, content, forms, methods, and means. It involves many tasks such as resource integration, process optimization, and platform reengineering, and involves all aspects of technology, operation, and management problems. . Where to solve the problem and how to solve the problem? How to focus on the key reforms that &quot;pulse one person to mobilize the whole body&quot;, innovative measures to achieve the traction effect of &quot;one child is full of vitality&quot;, and how to rectify the complex relationships between various aspects and different links? To this, we can find part of the answer just from the content structure of the book &quot;Common Knowledge&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the content structure, the book is divided into eight themes, namely &quot;Old Business and New Business&quot;, &quot;Rice Bowl and Stage&quot;, &quot;Career and Talent&quot;, &quot;Main Business and Industry&quot;, &quot;Content and Technology&quot; &quot;Removal of disadvantages and innovation&quot;, &quot;Management and construction&quot;, &quot;Big ecology and small ecology&quot;. Furthermore, the eight themes actually illustrate eight sets of major dialectical relationships that need to be accurately grasped to crack media integration. For example, &quot;Old Industry and New Industry&quot; focuses on a dialectical view of the relationship between traditional media and emerging media, and how to achieve complementary advantages, one can grow stronger than the other, and one can be better than the other during the iterative process of integration and transformation. &quot;Jobs and Stages&quot; focuses on how, in the face of the irreversible trend of the decline of traditional media, how to build a bigger and stronger self-controlled and controllable communication platform, provide a secure job, and create a stage for entrepreneurs to start their own businesses. By analogy, &quot;Business and Talent&quot; focuses on the construction of a talent team for integrated transformation; &quot;Main Business and Industry&quot; explores how to achieve positive mutual promotion between editing and operations; &quot;Content and Technology&quot; focuses on building a solid foundation for integrated transformation The technological foundation of and Small Ecology&quot; shows how for a provincial party newspaper group like Nanfang Newspaper, which has multiple sub-media, multiple ports, and multiple positions, to build an all-media communication system with misaligned development, coordination and harmony, and amplify the communication power of integrated development. and influence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/3bc02f7af596f0fabf0199532b415f1d.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;530&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/3bc02f7af596f0fabf0199532b415f1d.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252062&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Innovative measures for the southern newspaper industry’s institutional mechanisms. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to see from a detailed reading of &quot;Chang·shi&quot; that the eight sets of dialectical relationships are not &quot;theories out of thin air&quot;, but stem from the successful integration and transformation practice of the southern newspaper industry. A profound summary of the Southern Style of Play. In recent years, Southern Newspapers has taken improving modern communication capabilities as its primary task, deeply implemented the &quot;three integrations&quot; and &quot;four modernizations&quot; strategies and tactics (see the book &quot;Communication Power - Media Integration Practice of Southern Newspapers&quot; for details), and built It is a micro-screen all-media communication system for newspapers and periodicals with over 457 million users on the Internet. Its seven media organizations, including Nanfang Daily, Nanfang Magazine, Nanfang.com, Nanfang Rural Daily, Southern Weekend, Southern Metropolis Daily, and Nanfang+Client, are all among the &quot; &quot;Billion Yuan Media&quot; Club, Southern+, GDToday News Network (client), Nanzhou App, Nandu App, N Video, Guangdong Learning and other new communication platforms with independent controllability and strong communication capabilities are developing well. Southern+ has exceeded 1.7 With an outstanding performance of over 100 million downloads and over 6 million daily active users, it firmly occupies the position of the most authoritative mobile publishing platform of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government, and ranks first in the dissemination power of the self-owned client of the provincial party newspaper in the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such an outstanding performance in integration and transformation stems from the correct grasp of the eight sets of dialectical relationships discussed in the book. The author&#39;s so-called &quot;community&quot; is by no means a general discussion. He focuses on a series of key problems, important themes, and major issues in the integration and transformation of media. The author&#39;s in-depth explanation of the eight sets of dialectical relationships is the answer to the &quot;need and need&quot; dilemmas of effectively solving media convergence and transformation. From it, we can also get a glimpse of the successful code of the Southern newspaper industry&#39;s convergence and transformation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Feel regular knowledge from “common knowledge”: &lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt; span>;Transformation is not a career change&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The author states in his preface, &quot;The title of the book is &quot;Chang·Shi&quot;, which means both ordinary views and normal common sense.&quot; Looking at the whole book, there are many views on &quot;Without communication power, there is nothing&quot;, &quot;What kind of circle should Southern+ get out of&quot;, &quot;What kind of person should Mingji become&quot;, &quot;What kind of industry should we build&quot;, &quot;Let management and management change from a &#39;dilemma&#39; to a &#39;dilemma&#39; The in-depth discussions on a series of industry-concerned topics such as &quot;two ends&quot; can be said to have &quot;frequent golden sentences&quot;, which left a deep impression on people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Common sense is unusual. For a long time, in the face of the continuous fierce impact of new Internet media, where to go in media transformation has been the &lt;span>;most prominent&lt;/span>; problem. Practice has proved that the correct answer to this question often determines the path choice and future of a media. In this regard, the author clearly pointed out that &quot;transformation is not a change of career&quot; and emphasized that &quot;as mainstream media, regardless of newspapers, radio and television, websites, or clients, we must ask ourselves: what do we do?&quot; &quot;The southern newspaper industry must be clear about its positioning. No matter how it is transformed or integrated, the cornerstone status of media attributes cannot be shaken.&quot; In the current era of drastic changes in the industry, adhering to the strategic determination of &quot;still calm when flying through chaotic clouds&quot; is common sense, but it still requires an unusual &quot;sobriety in the world&quot;. Similar to the book, &quot;ignoring the media business is tantamount to discarding the basics&quot;, &quot;being independent and controllable does not mean starting from scratch&quot;, etc., etc., which may not seem to be profound and mysterious truths, but often require people to make clear decisions in the reality of integration and transformation. The right choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/1ddee1f0902287b520469a2b18222ed6.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/1ddee1f0902287b520469a2b18222ed6.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252061&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Four-year changes in the business structure of Southern Newspapers (2019-2022). &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Common sense is also consensus. As the author said, &quot;Common Knowledge&quot; &quot;presents by no means my personal practical thinking, but the crystallization of collective wisdom.&quot; It not only originates from the integration and transformation practice of Southern Newspaper Industry, but also condenses the consensus of all employees of Southern Newspaper Industry . It is not difficult to see from the discussions in the book, such as &quot;Content production and dissemination as the basis for survival&quot;, &quot;Building new mainstream media must adhere to &#39;long-termism&#39;&quot;, &quot;The most precious assets of the southern newspaper industry are two: the first is Talent, the second is communication power.&quot; &quot;Famous journalists are not judged, but typed.&quot; &quot;Only by &#39;sinking down&#39; can the foundation be everlasting.&quot; These are not only important concepts and principles that the southern newspaper industry adheres to in its integration and transformation, but also have long been Integrating into the daily development of the group has become a consensus practiced by the Southern Newspaper industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Common sense is a regular understanding. Many &quot;golden sentences&quot; in the book are not only insights, but also reflect a deep understanding of the laws of media integration and development. For example, when talking about the essence of transformation, he pointed out that &quot;transformation is the transformation of media from a &#39;paper&#39; form to a &#39;net&#39; form; integration is the fusion and symbiosis of old and new media forms&quot;; when talking about the relationship between main business and industry, It was pointed out that &quot;by strengthening the main business, the communication power and influence can produce spillover benefits, thereby doing a good job in the main business, leveraging the industry and bringing diversified income&quot;; when talking about the relationship between technology and content, it was pointed out that &quot;where the content is spread, Technical support will follow wherever you go.” Discussions like this are undoubtedly highly inspiring to the entire industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development of media integration is a big article. This year marks the 10th anniversary of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important instruction to “accelerate the integrated development of traditional media and emerging media.” At such an important time point, the publication of &quot;Common Knowledge&quot; undoubtedly provides a vivid sample and reference for us to summarize the media integration transformation practices of the entire industry and accelerate the in-depth development of media integration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/1f89d7f6202dd2ba9ff83a96f15f47a8.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;5678&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/1f89d7f6202dd2ba9ff83a96f15f47a8.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252064&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Table of contents of &quot;Common Knowledge - Southern Newspaper Media Integration Comics&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/07bb486f461ce7c1189ca9b7220c0010.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;851&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/07bb486f461ce7c1189ca9b7220c0010.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252060 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;About the author. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p class=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 14:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[亚运新项目电子竞技开赛，中国香港队小组赛战胜中国台北队]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257563]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25 13:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/24/ef0b241597.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/ef0b241597. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251859&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;September 24, 2023, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Hangzhou Asian Games e-sports events in China Hangzhou E-Sports Center kicks off. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 24, 2023, the Hangzhou Asian Games e-sports competition was held in Hangzhou, China The E-Sports Center starts.

On June 25, 2003, Li Jinhua, the then Auditor General of the National Audit Office, delivered the 2002 annual audit work report to the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress. A number of ministries and commissions, including the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Education, and the former State Planning Commission, were publicly criticized. At that time, the Internet had just emerged, and the full text of the report was made public on the official website of the National Audit Office, attracting national attention and calling it an &quot;audit storm.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Xiaorong, a professor at the School of Government Auditing at Nanjing Audit University, believes that 20 years ago, the public was accustomed to the government keeping fiscal revenue and expenditures secret. At that time, &quot;disclosure itself was a hot topic,&quot; but now, even if public opinion does not pay attention , auditing also functions as usual. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back over the past 20 years, it is not difficult to find that with the development of society, the focus of auditing has also changed. Different periods have different priorities, and some content has become history. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Tell the truth&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The 2022 audit work report has many highlights. Different from previous scientific and technological achievements transformation audits, this time for the first time it focused on basic research and key core technology tasks, pointing out that some task deployments and requirements deviated from the planned goals, and some scientific research results were suspected of fraud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The audit found that for 45 key tasks, from the formulation of implementation plans to the signing of task contracts, the indicator requirements were reduced step by step. Some technologies have been mass-produced in China and do not need to be tackled. The pass rate of 649 accepted projects was 96.5%, but a spot check of 135 of them found that 34 had actually not completed all tasks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Xiaorong observed, &quot;Every year we review and find problems every year.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 2022 annual audit work report pointed out that 41 regions collected state-owned capital gains from loss-making enterprises, levied excessive taxes, or directly and randomly apportioned fines, etc., and illegally organized fiscal revenue of 7.75 billion yuan; 49 regions passed the commitment Through methods such as bottom-up buybacks and state-owned enterprise advance financing for construction, illegal new hidden debts of 41.516 billion yuan were added; 12 regions had to allocate treasury funds from superiors&#39; over-budget quotas, obtain bank advances or external borrowings of 28.072 billion yuan to maintain basic operations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem of neglect of management and supervision by units affiliated to various central ministries and commissions still exists. For example, 3 departments and 29 affiliated units were extravagant and wasteful. Some spent more than 27 million yuan to rent office space, with the per capita office area reaching 137 square meters. Some exceeded the contract schedule and spent 84.5807 million yuan at the end of the year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar problems were named 20 years ago. The 2002 annual audit work report pointed out that the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology fabricated false project budgets, signed false construction contracts with an engineering agency, and allocated 1.35 million yuan in budget funds. The Agency then recovered it in batches and used it mainly for the payment of staff subsidies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An audit cadre recalled that it was in 2003 that the Audit Office became known to the public. Twenty years have passed since the Audit Office was established in 1983. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 25, 2003, after the full text of the 2002 audit work report was made public on the official website of the National Audit Office, it was widely reproduced by the media. Yang Suchang, a professor at the School of Economics at Lanzhou University, still remembers the shock brought by the report, &quot;(It turns out) the problem is so serious.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problems disclosed this year include: the fiscal revenue of counties and cities is relatively &quot;watered&quot;, artificial concealment of deficits is common, and the debt burden is heavy; the problem of enterprises failing to pay basic pension insurance funds is relatively common, and relevant management departments have misappropriated 420 million yuan; the National College English Level 4 and Level 6 Examination Committee of the Ministry of Education illegally collected 224 million yuan of examination fees from various places, from which 190 million yuan was spent on related examination fees and other expenses. etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the shocking nature of the problems announced, the public called it an &quot;audit storm.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the &quot;audit storm&quot; may be traced back to 1999. According to the audit work procedures at that time, every May, the National Audit Office should issue an audit results report to the State Council on the audit work of the previous year. Based on this report, it would then draft an audit work report to be submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report to the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress fully explained the problems discovered in the audit. On June 26, 1999, Li Jinhua made the &quot;1998 Audit Work Report&quot; to the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress, pointing out that 43 departments and directly affiliated units of the State Council had misappropriated 3.124 billion yuan of fiscal funds and other issues. The China Economic Times quoted some members as saying , saying it was “the best audit report in many years.” &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;After the 18th National Congress, poverty alleviation auditing became a focus&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Since 2003, what areas have audit work focused on? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters combed through and found that among the 21 &quot;Audit Work Reports&quot; from 2002 to 2022, in addition to the fixed annual financial audits, resource and environmental protection, social security funds, agriculture and rural areas are the most concerned. fields, appeared 17 times, 13 times, and 13 times respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In different periods, audit work also has different priorities. Taking the &quot;three official&quot; funds as an example, the 2007 annual audit work report used 103 words, pointing out for the first time that the tax department purchased cars without and beyond the establishment, as well as the problems of insufficient strict control of entertainment expenses, conference fees, training fees and overseas expenses. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, with the formulation and implementation of the eight central regulations, the &quot;three public&quot; funds began to become the focus of audit supervision. The 2013 annual audit work report used an unprecedented 1,244 words to directly address the management and use of &quot;three official&quot; funds and conference fees, naming 22 central departments and affiliated units. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2014, the “three official” funds and conference fee expenditures of central departments dropped by 27% compared with the previous year, and the reform of official vehicles at the department level was basically completed. However, the audit still found that 33 departments and units, including the Ministry of Science and Technology and the former Ministry of Culture, occupied vehicles from other units for a long time, or leased 122 official vehicles in disguise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For nine consecutive years, &quot;three public funds&quot; have been mentioned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Poverty alleviation was once the focus of the report. After the &quot;targeted poverty alleviation&quot; strategy was proposed in November 2013, the following year, the audit report once again included content on poverty alleviation auditing after a lapse of ten years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report pointed out that after auditing 19 key counties for national poverty alleviation and development work, it was found that 15.9571 million yuan of poverty alleviation funds were misappropriated by individuals, 173 million yuan of poverty alleviation funds were falsely claimed or misappropriated, and 5 counties had poverty alleviation funds. The department in charge of work illegally included 533,600 yuan in food, drink, and travel expenses among poverty alleviation management fees and other funds, and 227 million yuan in poverty alleviation funds remained idle for more than one year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/evLOaYcG1oPhzGE1tX8YmI86cZI29BnAy3yyGxM4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1271&quot; height= &quot;739&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/evLOaYcG1oPhzGE1tX8YmI86cZI29BnAy3yyGxM4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251919&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The 2022 annual audit work report pointed out that it is difficult for local governments to coordinate, integrate and use high-standard farmland construction funds. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(People&#39;s Vision/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 29, 2015, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the &quot;Decision on Winning the Battle against Poverty&quot; , proposed to ensure that the rural poor will be lifted out of poverty by 2020, requiring the key links of accurate identification and establishment of files to be lifted out of poverty through industrial support and other measures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This was reflected in the report of the second year. The &quot;2015 Audit Work Report&quot; mentioned that a random inspection of 1,339 poverty alleviation household discount loans of 65.6 million yuan issued in Xundian County, Yunnan Province in 2015 Among them, only 711 amounts of 34.33 million yuan (accounting for 52%) were distributed to registered poor households. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2022, the report has audited employment subsidies and employment promotion funds for two consecutive years. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Some sectors have been renamed 7 times&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the past 20 years, the form of audit work reports has also changed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One change is the report name. The 2012 annual audit report produced in 2013 was titled &quot;Audit Work Report on the Implementation of the Central Budget and Other Financial Revenues and Expenditures in 2012&quot;. The following year, it was changed to &quot;Audit Work Report of the State Council on the Implementation of the Central Budget and Other Financial Revenues and Expenditures in 2013&quot;. , this format has been fixed to this day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not simply 3 more words. Zheng Xiaorong believes that according to the provisions of the Audit Law, the audit work report is submitted by the State Council to the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress. In practice, the National Audit Office makes the report on behalf of the State Council. Adding &quot;State Council&quot; to the title is more in line with the spirit of the Audit Law and can better reflect the authority of the audit work report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, the title at the beginning of the audit work report was adjusted from the previous &quot;Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress&quot; to &quot;Chairman, Vice Chairmen, Secretary-General, and Members.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Zheng Xiaorong&#39;s view, the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress is an institution, and the latter is more specific, &quot;similar to a roll call.&quot; The change of title is &quot;I hope that when deliberation and resolution of work reports, everyone attending the meeting &quot;People&#39;s Congress attaches great importance to it and strengthens the supervision role of the National People&#39;s Congress.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The public is particularly concerned about which units are named. Over the past 20 years, the &quot;roll call&quot; has gone through a process from vague to gradually clear, and the number of named units has also changed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 2002 annual audit work report blurred some region and unit information, replacing it with &quot;a certain province&quot;, &quot;a certain district government&quot;, &quot;some airlines&quot;, etc. As for the persons who violated laws and disciplines discovered by the audit, it was not until the 2006 annual audit work report that the names of the parties began to appear. Previously, only their units and positions were named. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Xiaorong believes that this is a sign of caution by the audit agency. Information disclosure was still sensitive at the time. &quot;After the information is disclosed, there will be unexpected results.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Another change is that after 2017, the number of units named in the report decreased. Southern Weekend reporters did not make complete statistics. In 2017, the report named 24 units, but this number dropped to 3 in 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of Li Yuedong, director of the Audit Department of Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, this has something to do with the changes in the audit function. &quot;Now it is more about helping the audited unit solve problems.&quot; The time for audit evidence collection is limited, and More emphasis is placed on the discovery of major problems. &quot;Some small problems may not necessarily appear in the report. Just inform them of the rectification.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Xiaorong added that in the past, some audited units were not very cooperative during the work process and did not report in the report. Name-calling was once a way to promote rectification. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fixed sections in the audit work report have also undergone many name changes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found that for the first time in the 2008 annual audit work report, the chapter &quot;Disclosure and investigation of major violations of laws and regulations&quot; appeared. In addition to announcing the number of transferred clues to major violations of laws and regulations and economic crime cases, In addition to the number of people involved, the form, means and methods of the crime are also summarized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, the chapter has been renamed 7 times, such as &quot;Major violations of laws and regulations and economic crime cases discovered by audit&quot; in 2012, and &quot;Major violations of laws and regulations discovered by audit&quot; in 2013. In 2014, it was “cases suspected of major violations of laws and regulations detected by audit.” In 2021, it was renamed &quot;Clues to Major Violations of Discipline and Law&quot; and remains so far. The issues mentioned include &quot;corruption of petty officials&quot;, micro-corruption at the grassroots level and &quot;supporters taking advantage of the mountain&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 21 audit reports, the content, location and name of the chapters are not fixed as a whole. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Xiaorong also noticed this phenomenon. He believed that as the system gradually becomes standardized, the audit agency has discretion over the form of the audit work report, which will also affect the text form and framework of the report. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Breaking Barriers&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“Governments at different levels bear public entrusted economic responsibilities. While fulfilling their responsibilities, the government has also been given specific responsibilities. Power.&quot; Cai Chun believes that the role of auditing is to ensure the fulfillment of government responsibilities and promote the use of public power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found that the 2009 annual audit work report pointed out the overall large scale of local government debt, the high debt repayment pressure of some local governments, and the insufficient solvency of fiscal funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, in accordance with the requirements of the State Council, in 2011 the National Audit Office organized more than 40,000 audit agencies across the country to conduct audits on all audit offices across the country based on the principle of &quot;seeing accounts, people, and objects, and reviewing each transaction one by one.&quot; 25,590 government departments and agencies, 6,576 financing platform companies, 54,061 other units, 373,805 projects and 1,873,683 debts involved in local government debt were audited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Audit rectification was once a &quot;difficult&quot; issue. Before the revision of the Audit Law in 2021, there were no specific provisions on what measures should be taken if the audit object does not make rectifications as required. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Until the newly revised Audit Law responded: &quot;The audit results and rectification status should be used as an important reference for assessing, appointing and removing, rewarding and punishing leading cadres, formulating policies, and improving systems; those who refuse to rectify or commit fraud during rectification will be Legal responsibilities shall be pursued in accordance with the law.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Audit Law, audit agencies are under the dual leadership of the government at the same level and the audit agency at the next higher level. In reality, the government at the same level has a greater influence on the audit agency at the same level. Liu Air Force, a staff member of the Audit Bureau of Huaihua City, Hunan Province, published an article in 2009 stating that 62% of team members in 13 local county (city, district) grassroots audit agencies were adjusted without consulting the superior audit agency in advance, resulting in dual management. Just a formality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Zheng Xiaorong, before the audit results are reported to the people&#39;s congress at the same level, the government has the opportunity to intercept and screen the problems reported. &quot;Some problems cannot be investigated thoroughly, and the supervisory power cannot be extended downwards.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Around 2010, there were many views on the issue of audit system reform. According to an article published on the official website of the Audit Office in 2013, Huang Kai, the director of the Audit Office, summarized the views of all parties into the theory of upgrading. , vertical theory, independence theory and legislative theory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The legislative theory that is most highly praised by industry insiders is that the audit agency is subordinate to the People&#39;s Congress and independently exercises audit supervision power over government departments. As early as 2002, Yang Suchang conducted a questionnaire survey among 62 Audit Office officials, local audit agency officials, government officials, People&#39;s Congress cadres, and audit scholars. 77% of the respondents agreed or basically agreed with the legislative audit system reform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The discussion on the reform of the audit system has not stopped. In December 2017, after the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Yang Suchang was invited by the National Audit Office to discuss the direction of audit system reform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The answer will be revealed soon. In March 2018, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the &quot;Plan for Deepening the Reform of Party and State Institutions&quot; and announced the establishment of the Central Audit Commission. &quot;I didn&#39;t expect it to be established.&quot; Yang Suchang said that from a practical perspective, &quot;Under the leadership of the Central Audit Commission, the audit work is integrated with the party&#39;s leadership and supervision system.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problems found in the audit &quot;must Reporting to the Central Audit Committee, and directly”. Zheng Xiaorong believes that although the current audit institutions are still under the dual leadership of the government at the same level and the audit institution at the higher level, the Central Audit Commission has broken down the barriers formed under government management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[印度裔CEO正在“统治”世界，凭的是什么？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257541]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, there is a half-joking saying circulating in the field of workplace human resources (HR): Indians are using a A strange way to &quot;rule&quot; the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meaning is: Indian-origin professional managers and workplace elites are achieving greater and greater success in the world. More than 30% of the CEOs of large Silicon Valley companies in the United States are Indians. Among U.S. companies, the top ten Indian-Americans serve as chairman, CEO, president, and chief operating officer: Google &amp;amp; Alphabet, Microsoft, FedEx, IBM, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, NetApp, Barclays Group, Starbucks, and Adobe , Micron Technology and other world-renowned companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Led by this type of Indian professional managers who hold top-level positions, these companies have recruited a large number of younger, lower-level Indian elites for high- and middle-level management positions, technical positions, Key positions such as finance and human resources are increasingly occupied by Indian career elites. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Indians have an increasing influence in the Western world and have become the most powerful minority group in American and British societies. Many Westerners know that Indians are not easy to mess with, and the social status they have gained , the social achievements achieved far exceed those of local Chinese. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have interviewed some HR organizations to understand why they are willing to promote Indian professional managers, what employers think of Indian managers, and why Indians have achieved such achievements. The feedback received shows that Indians The advantages of ethnic-American workplace elites are roughly as follows:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Value recognition: India was a British colony for a long time, and Indians were once ridiculed as British &quot;long-term laborers and coolies.&quot; However, Indians identify with and want to integrate into Britain and the United States. Social and lifestyle motivations are strong. Their purpose of studying hard is often to enter the British and American society, and gradually become &quot;foremen, housekeepers, and shopkeepers&quot; from &quot;long-term workers&quot;. When Indians go to Britain and the United States, they have no intention of going back. Instead, they try their best to take root there and transform from &quot;Indians&quot; to &quot;Indians.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Communication advantages: As a former British colony, high-end schools in India focus on English education. Therefore, its educational elites, despite their thick accents, have no barriers to language communication, which is a great advantage in the British and American workplaces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because Hindi belongs to the &quot;Eurasian language family&quot; and has many similarities with Western languages, based on Hinglish, there are also fewer obstacles for Indians to learn French, German, and Spanish. few. Therefore, the current trend of Indian workplace elites spreading from English-speaking societies to the entire Western world. The second communication advantage of Indians is that their living customs advocate chatting, chatting, and debating. Therefore, they can get along well with Westerners. Even if they have different opinions, they can chat and dare to talk. It is easier for them to get familiar with each other, which is good for promotion. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cultural diversity: India has 6 major religions, 22 official regional languages, 212 ethnic groups, and 414 tribes. Religions, cultures, and living customs vary greatly among regions and ethnic groups. Such a complex society makes Indians more adaptable to culturally diverse lifestyles. There has never been a &quot;grand unification&quot; in India&#39;s history, and its unification was all established with the help of the British. Therefore, when Indians come to the Western world, not only do they not find it weird and weird, but they think Westerners are too serious, rigid, and simple. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teamwork: Indians focus on teamwork and interpersonal relationships, and their individuals usually have good interpersonal and communication skills, which are very important for senior management positions. Indians are very cooperative, and Indian executives in companies try their best to recruit Indian employees. There have even been cases of fraud: when an American hospital recruits doctors, the Indian director throws away all the resumes of non-Indian applicants. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The folk rule of the Indian people is: those who are successfully recruited should give all of their 1-3 months&#39; salary (the higher the position, the higher the kickback) to the recruiter to express their gratitude for the kindness. . Almost no one in the Indian community violates this convention, forming a long-standing custom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obedience and loyalty: Corresponding to the above-mentioned Indian workplace custom of &quot;recruitment kickbacks&quot;, Indian employees are highly obedient to their superiors. Their subordinates are very good at communicating with their leaders. They will often ask their leaders: What else do you need from me? What am I not doing well? What can you do to be more satisfied? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you have hired Indians, you will feel that they are generally more submissive, reliable, and secure, and leaders will gradually feel comfortable appointing and promoting them. One way of saying it is that Indian people often shake their heads slightly (to express approval and obedience) and say: I see, I see (I understand). It is known as &quot;Ah San, Ah San&quot; by Chinese people. Another theory is that Asan is &quot;Asir&quot;. At that time, the British often recruited Indians to serve as police officers in the colonies or concessions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People recruited by themselves are more capable, less likely to get into trouble, and less likely to cheat. This is also the reason why Indian executives dare to recruit subordinates of the same race. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Resilience: Americans love to mock their government as useless and their president as incompetent. In the eyes of Indians, their own country and government are even worse. In order to survive in their own country, Indians have learned to persevere and make full use of limited resources to live under endless harsh conditions. This ability makes Indian employees more hardworking and hardworking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Humility: As new immigrants from a backward and poor society, Indians understand and admit their limitations and deficiencies in many aspects. Therefore, they are more humble and open-minded during the learning process, making it easier for them to integrate into the local area and be accepted by the local society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Educational advantages in technology and engineering fields: As a late-developing country, India&#39;s education is similar to that in East Asia, with more emphasis on science and technology, engineering and other science and engineering courses. It is particularly distinctive in fields such as computers, engineering, and technological innovation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Indian Institute of Technology&quot; even boasts that &quot;those who cannot get into Indian Institute of Technology should go to MIT.&quot; This is of course bragging, but the large number of science and engineering talents it has trained have just made up for the excessive wealth in the English-speaking world. After a long period of peace, more and more wealthy young people no longer want to study hard to study science and engineering, but study &quot;literature, history, philosophy and arts&quot;. ” and other weaknesses of so-called “rich people’s disciplines”. The &quot;rich N generation&quot; in Europe and the United States learn the art of maintaining success and the method of controlling people, while the science and engineering talents from India serve as CEOs, directors, managers, technological elites... to achieve their own class jump. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dare to take risks and start a business: Indian individuals are more willing to take risks and start a business. They are more willing to set up their own companies and serve as CEOs after they grow. This entrepreneurial tendency has made them achieve great success in the business world. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, Indians are moving from the business world to the political world, and the jokes about &quot;dominating&quot; the world are gradually becoming serious: British Prime Minister Sunak, Singaporean President Shanmugaratnam, Irish Prime Minister Varadkar, Portuguese Prime Minister Costa, and the President of Mauritius Roopun, Prime Minister Jugnauth, Guyana President Irfaan Ali, Suriname President Santokhi, etc. are all Indians. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are currently too many Indian cabinet members in the U.S. government: Assistant to the President and Domestic Policy Advisor, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Deputy Director of the National Economic Council, Senior Advisor to the Secretary of State, White House Chip Advisor and U.S. Commerce The department’s chief economist, deputy director of the White House Office of Presidential Personnel, senior White House staff and presidential speech writers are all Indians. However, Indians only account for 1.4% of the U.S. population. With such a small population weight, they can leverage such huge political influence. Leverage affects the national policies of the United States and even the direction of world politics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The idea that Indian elites &quot;dominate&quot; the world is a joke to many people, but the trend cannot be underestimated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 12:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[有奖征集 | 鲁迅的哪些话，让你印象深刻？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257549]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In fifty-five years of life, I have left behind countless words.

The award will also announce the winning projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Several of this year’s alternative Nobel Prizes just announced are related to human health and life. First, the Public Health Award goes to Stanford urologist Park Seung-min for his invention of the Stanford toilet: a &quot;smart toilet&quot; that can monitor health conditions such as urinary tract infections, diabetes and others by analyzing a user&#39;s urine and feces. signs of disease. Additionally, toilet-mounted sensors can identify users based on the unique characteristics of each person&#39;s anus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second prize in medicine was awarded to the team of Natasha Mesinkovska, a dermatologist at the University of California, Irvine. He and his team members carefully observed the noses of human corpses and determined whether there were the same number of nasal hairs in each nostril. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Alternative Nobel Prize has been awarded since 1991. It is an interesting imitation of the Nobel Prize and rewards achievements in 10 aspects. Its name comes from the combination of Ignoble and Nobel Prize. The organizer is the scientific humor magazine &quot;Annals of Improbable Research&quot; (Annals of Improbable Research), and some of the judges are real Nobel Prize winners. The aim is to select studies that &quot;make you laugh at first and then thought-provoking&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 2023 Alternative Nobel Prize for Public Health is not just laughable, but indeed innovative and practical. Disease prevention is better than disease treatment, this is the consensus of everyone. Annual physical exams are just a means of prevention. But even this kind of physical examination is considered daunting by many people, because it is not only troublesome to draw blood, defecate and defecate (urinate and defecate), but also requires a special visit to a hospital or physical examination company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the invention of smart toilets may solve these problems and make physical examinations easier, especially for urine and feces examinations, which can predict and predict people&#39;s physical conditions and what diseases may occur. sign. Urine itself can reflect various conditions of the urinary system. When inflammation, stones, tuberculosis, tumors, kidney transplant rejection, renal failure, etc. occur, the composition of urine will change; when certain diseases cause changes in blood composition, Corresponding changes in the composition of urine may also occur, such as diabetes, pancreatitis, jaundice, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Stool can reflect more conditions of the body. You can know whether there is inflammation and infection in the digestive tract and the bile ducts leading to the digestive tract, including parasitic infections; There is no bleeding caused by lesions, and when colon tumors or ulcerative colitis occur, bloody stools are the main symptom; the fecal occult blood test (chemical method or immunological method) can detect bleeding that cannot be identified with the naked eye, and can also be used as the first step in the general screening of digestive tract tumors. Screening means; through bacterial culture or microscopy, the intestinal tract can be checked for pathogenic bacteria (such as typhoid bacilli, salmonella, dysentery bacilli) to prevent and treat intestinal infectious diseases; it can assist in the diagnosis of certain hepatobiliary diseases, such as obstructive jaundice The stool is clay-colored, and small stones can be detected in the stool when suffering from cholelithiasis; the digestion status of food in the gastrointestinal tract can be understood. For example, oil droplets in the stool indicate maldigestion and absorption of fat, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The smart toilet comprehensively detects and quickly analyzes human excrement through a series of high-end technologies such as test strips, computer vision systems, cameras, and image recognition. It also combines artificial intelligence, so it can detect the size of a person. It&#39;s fast and convenient. However, what needs to be confirmed is whether the detection results of this smart toilet are accurate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This detection is similar to the original invention to detect cell-free DNA (cfDNA). cfDNA is a DNA fragment discharged into the blood by human cells, with a length of about 167 base pairs. The content in the blood is very low, and it mainly comes from dead somatic cells. Cancer patients have higher cfDNA content in the blood, which comes from dead tumor cells in their bodies. These cfDNA from tumors are called circulating tumors (ctDNA), which can be used as one of the biomarkers for detecting cancer. Now many medical examination companies have also launched ctDNA testing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another function of cfDNA is to detect fetal abnormalities. Human embryos will also discharge some DNA into the blood, called cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA), which enters the maternal blood circulation through apoptotic trophoblast cells shed from placental tissue. In 1997, Professor Lo Yuk-ming from Hong Kong, China, discovered that cffDNA could be extracted from the blood of pregnant women to diagnose fetal malformations, such as congenital dementia (Down syndrome). He is also known as the founder of non-invasive DNA prenatal testing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;non-invasive prenatal diagnosis&quot; (NIPT) technology invented by Lu Yuming has been widely used in more than 60 countries and regions around the world for many years. Because this kind of test is simpler and more user-friendly, it does not require a large amount of blood to be drawn or amniotic fluid puncture, which saves pregnant women a lot of trouble and risks. For this reason, Lu Yuming was awarded the &quot;2022 Lasker Clinical Medicine Award&quot;. This is one of the most prestigious awards in the medical field, known as the &quot;Nobel Weather Vane&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the smart toilet that won the Alternative Nobel Prize this year can accurately diagnose urinary tract infections, diabetes and even tumors by analyzing the user&#39;s urine and feces, it will undoubtedly be the first Alternative Nobel Prize in recent years. The trend is that this award will become more and more practical, not just what people think of as &quot;funny&quot;. As for whether it will become another benchmark for the Nobel Prize, that is another matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 24 Sep 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[又丧气又温暖，这纪录片真神奇]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257434]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-24 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;In 2021, Martin Scorsese once He teamed up with Netflix to produce a biographical comedy documentary &quot;Pretend This Is a City.&quot; The film stars Martin&#39;s longtime friend, writer and critic Fran Lebowitz. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fran, who has a strong intellectual aura, is enough to make those who love her happy when she walks on the streets of New York.
