The deadline for feedback is November 19, 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Generally speaking, the &quot;Cash Dividend Guidelines&quot; have mainly revised three aspects: first, to further clarify the direction of cash dividends, second to simplify the mid-term dividend procedures, and thirdly to strengthen the constraints on companies that exceed their ability to pay dividends. The &quot;Articles of Association Guidelines&quot; have revised the contents of Articles 153, 155 and 156 related to cash dividends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later on the same day, in accordance with the unified deployment of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges revised the Shanghai Stock Exchange Main Board and Science and Technology Innovation Board, and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange Main Board and GEM Standardized Operation Guidelines for Cash Dividends. Public opinion solicitation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This revision is a further implementation of the China Securities Regulatory Commission’s active capital market policy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The China Securities Regulatory Commission explained that the main idea of ​​this revision of cash dividend rules is to encourage companies to formulate clear dividend policies in their articles of association on the basis of adhering to corporate autonomy, stabilize investors’ dividend expectations, and ensure that non-dividends and financial Companies with large investment scales but low dividend distribution ratios should be urged to pay dividends by strengthening disclosure requirements; facilitate the company&#39;s mid-term dividend implementation procedures and encourage companies to increase the frequency of cash dividends; strengthen constraints on companies with abnormally high dividend distribution ratios and guide reasonable dividend distribution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 27, the China Securities Regulatory Commission also regulated the behavior of shareholding reductions and introduced a &quot;linking&quot; policy between dividends and shareholding reductions, stipulating that listed companies have broken shares or net losses, or have not distributed cash dividends in the past three years. . If the accumulated cash dividend amount is less than 30% of the average annual net profit in the past three years, the controlling shareholder or actual controller shall not reduce its shareholdings through the secondary market. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The annual dividend amount exceeds the amount of equity financing&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In recent years, driven by policy guidance and supervision, the dividend situation of A-share listed companies has continued to improve. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The China Securities Regulatory Commission stated that in the past five years, A-share listed companies have paid a cumulative dividend of 8.2 trillion yuan, and the annual dividend amount has begun to exceed the amount of equity financing that year. Among them, a total of 3,291 Shanghai and Shenzhen listed companies paid cash dividends in 2022, with a dividend amount of 2.1 trillion yuan, of which 1.6 trillion yuan was distributed to domestic investors, a year-on-year increase of 22.7%, and the number of dividend companies accounted for 67.1%. The dividend payout rate (32.5%) and dividend rate (1.97%) are in the middle and upper reaches compared with major global capital markets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Yang Delong, chief economist of Qianhai Kaiyuan, also told Southern Weekend reporters that the cash dividend performance of A-share listed companies has improved significantly compared with ten years ago, and listed companies also hope to enhance investor confidence through cash dividends. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this revision, the &quot;Cash Dividend Guidelines&quot; have detailed regulations and explanations for companies that &quot;evade&quot; dividends and &quot;excessive&quot; dividends. The dividend distribution procedures have also been optimized. The revisions mainly include three aspects: &lt; /p>; &lt;p>;First of all, it is necessary to further clarify the direction of cash dividends and promote an increase in the level of dividends. The first is to strengthen institutional constraints on companies that do not pay dividends and urge them to pay dividends. For companies that have not distributed cash dividends, disclosure requirements will be strengthened. In addition to disclosing specific reasons, they must also disclose the next steps to be taken to enhance investor returns; second, focus on companies with large financial investments but low dividend levels. Pay attention and urge to increase the level of dividends and focus on the main business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, we should simplify the mid-term dividend distribution process and promote further optimization of the dividend method and rhythm. Encourage companies to increase the frequency of dividends when conditions permit, so that investors can share company growth dividends earlier. Combined with regulatory practice, listed companies are allowed to review and approve the conditions and upper limit for the next year&#39;s interim cash dividend within a certain amount when convening the annual shareholders&#39; meeting to review the annual profit distribution plan. Subsequently, the board of directors will formulate a specific interim dividend plan to facilitate the company&#39;s further improvement. The frequency of dividend payments allows investors to better plan capital arrangements and share corporate growth dividends earlier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We must once again strengthen the constraints on companies that pay dividends beyond their capabilities and guide reasonable dividend distribution. First, it is emphasized that when listed companies formulate cash dividend policies, they should comprehensively consider their own profitability, capital expenditure arrangements and debt repayment capabilities, as well as investor returns and company development needs; second, it is emphasized that supervision should be carried out on companies with high asset-liability ratios and cash from operating activities. Companies with poor flow and large proportions of cash dividends should pay close attention to prevent adverse effects on the company&#39;s production, operations and debt solvency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This revision also combines the reform of the independent director system and deletes the relevant requirements for independent directors to express opinions in the &quot;Cash Dividend Guidelines&quot;. At the same time, the adaptability regulations have been modified in conjunction with the registration system reform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Although cash dividends do not directly increase shareholders’ equity, they are of particular significance to the entire A-share market.” Yang Delong explained that cash dividends on the one hand show that the company has profitability and that there is real money in the account; This aspect shows that the company has sincerity and social responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Delong previously wrote that in the A-share market, some listed companies are profitable but do not pay dividends for a long time, which harms the interests of small and medium investors. The China Securities Regulatory Commission has adopted specific regulations to encourage listed companies to pay cash dividends and strengthen inquiries on companies that have not paid cash dividends for a long time. This will help boost investors’ confidence in listed companies. It also urges the management of listed companies to make the company bigger and stronger, and encourages Major shareholders bind the interests of small and medium-sized investors through cash dividends to promote the establishment of a good ecosystem in the A-share market and the overall improvement of the quality of listed companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;There is still room for improvement&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When issuing the revised instructions, the China Securities Regulatory Commission also emphasized that “compared with mature overseas markets, the balance, timeliness, and Stability needs to be further improved, investors&#39; sense of gain needs to be enhanced, and some companies pay abnormally high proportions of dividends, which may damage debt solvency and continued operating capabilities, requiring timely guidance and regulation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Changjiang Securities is also in the process. A 2023 research report stated that A-share dividend strategies have performed better in recent years, but from a global perspective, there are still differences with overseas mature markets in terms of dividend levels, high dividend yield sectors, and the stability of dividend strategies. The difference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of willingness to pay dividends, the total amount of dividends paid in the A-share market has maintained a high growth rate, and the proportion of dividend-paying listed companies has increased year by year. It has a strong dividend investment foundation, but the sustainability and growth of dividends are still inconsistent with There is a certain gap in developed markets such as the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of dividend payout ratio and dividend rate, the Hong Kong market in China is the highest as a whole, and the willingness to pay dividends and dividend rate levels of A-share listed companies are generally in the middle, while the U.S. market is relatively the lowest, with the dividend payout ratio of A-shares in 2022 being about 32.5 %, and the dividend yield is about 1.9%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of dividends, A-share dividends are mainly concentrated on the Shanghai Stock Exchange main board, and central and state-owned enterprises pay greater dividends. Dividends in Hong Kong stocks mainly come from state-owned enterprise stocks, and the total dividends paid by local companies in Hong Kong do not account for a high proportion. Among U.S. stocks, the New York Stock Exchange’s total dividends dominate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of dividend time and frequency, the frequency of dividends in the A-share market is mostly once a year, and the actual time of dividend distribution is mostly concentrated between May and July. The average number of annual dividends for Hong Kong stocks is about 1.5 times, and it is mostly used for U.S. stocks. Quarterly dividend payment method. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Compared with U.S. stocks, the cash dividend ratio of A-shares is still low.” Yang Delong said that many companies in the United States repurchase and then cancel their shares to reward investors. Although the number of repurchases and cancellations in the A-share market has increased, in terms of proportion and amount, it is far lower than that of U.S. stocks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Yang Delong’s view, cash dividends plus share repurchases and cancellations are the best way to reward investors and are also a direction for future market reform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Yang Delong believes that the dividend mechanism of A-shares can be further increased in guidance and mandatory in the future, especially for listed companies with financing needs, requiring them to pay dividends in excess of the IPO financing amount before they can again Financing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This can put certain restrictions on the company&#39;s financing behavior and allow it to truly give back to investors instead of constantly asking the market for money.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 22 Oct 2023 17:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[内塔尼亚胡的司法改革：以色列的安全保障还是“拆家怪兽”？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259029]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-22 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/RVVt5EKyjeJxmmWobYb73JO8APo0UNnqS9BmFTCf.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/RVVt5EKyjeJxmmWobYb73JO8APo0UNn qS9BmFTCf. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254449&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On January 1, 2023, in Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu cried during a visit Wall to commemorate the swearing-in of Israel&#39;s 37th government. He placed a prayer note in the gap &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;October 7, 2023, de facto control of Gaza Hamas in the region suddenly launched the &quot;Operation Al-Aqsa Flood&quot;, a large-scale indiscriminate attack on Israeli territory. It has always occupied the absolute initiative in the Palestinian-Israeli and even Jewish-Arab conflicts and has a sense of security. Israel was caught off guard. The attack in just a few hours resulted in the death of more than 1,400 Israeli soldiers and civilians, and the abduction of at least 155 people. Although Israel&#39;s subsequent air strikes, shelling, blockade and other retaliations cost Gaza nearly 3,000 lives, Hamas&#39;s armed forces have ceased their activities. Israel&#39;s retaliation has increasingly attracted strong international reactions, which has greatly weakened Israel&#39;s &quot;terrorist attack victims&quot;. &quot;the image of the person&quot;. Not only that, the casualties, losses and frustrations caused by the &quot;Aqsa Flood&quot; are unprecedented in Israel since its founding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some analysts believe that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (Benjamin Netanyahu) has always advertised the &quot;judicial reform&quot; that &quot;will bring the greatest safety factor to Israelis&quot;, which has a negative impact on Israel&#39;s attack by Hamas this time. He bears an unshirkable responsibility for invading the mainland and &quot;beating the country&quot;, but Netanyahu himself and his die-hard supporters still insist that &quot;judicial reform&quot; is Israel&#39;s &quot;security guarantee.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what is &quot;Netanyahu&#39;s judicial reform&quot;? Is it Israel&#39;s security guarantee or a &quot;house-destroying monster&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/JI66Q1RpbnwQl5tYA1Z3AdWCdhxR6jCv9c4B6k2S.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/JI66Q1RpbnwQl5tYA1Z3AdWCdhxR6jCv9c4B6k2S.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254448&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 10, 2023, rockets fired towards Israel were photographed in Gaza City&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/ span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;What is &quot;Netanyahu&#39;s judicial reform&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Netanyahu has always been a polar figure in Israeli politics and the international community because of his extremely conservative and hard-line stance. Controversial role. Having stepped down after several elections, he relied on the particularities of Israel&#39;s electoral system and parliamentary composition, and by co-opting several small Jewish parties and fundamentalist parties that were more &quot;right&quot; than the Likud Party to which he belonged, and repeatedly succeeded in making comebacks and winning the election. The government has been reorganized, but the relatively independent Israeli judicial system has posed a more persistent threat to it than the opposition parties: After returning to the prime minister&#39;s seat in November 2022, he will still have to face at least three criminal charges in the judicial system, including corruption. , abuse of power, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to once and for all weaken the judicial system&#39;s ability to constrain administrative power and ensure the authority and continuity of his governance, Netanyahu proposed &quot;judicial reform&quot; as early as during his last administration. After taking office, he systematized, theorized and put it into action. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2023, Netanyahu proposed &quot;five measures to reform the Israeli judicial system and the balance of power&quot;, including changing the selection method of judges; reforming the nature of legal advisors to government ministries; and reviewing the Basic Law Change of powers; empower the Parliament to reject the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the Basic Law; abolish the legal basis for Israeli courts to interfere with administrative decisions of administrative agencies on the grounds of “unreasonableness”; remove the Supreme Court’s power to review and veto government administrative orders, stipulating that as long as the Parliament simply A majority can override this veto. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These measures can be said to be extremely damaging to the judicial system. Take changing the method of selecting judges as an example: the existing nine members of the Judicial Selection Committee include three Supreme Court judges, two representatives of the Bar Association, two MPs and two ministers, the appointment of all judges requires a simple majority of the Judicial Selection Committee, and the selection of Supreme Court judges requires the approval of at least 7 people, which means that for the selection of ordinary judges, the 5 people in the judicial system have a lot of confidence in the selection of the Supreme Court. In the selection of judges, the three Supreme Court judges have the power of blocking with one vote. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Reform&quot; proposes to expand the Judicial Selection Committee to 11 people, including the Minister of Justice (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Chairman&lt;/span>;) , two other ministers designated by the government, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Constitution, Law and Justice, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on State Control, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee, the President of the Supreme Court, two other Supreme Court Justices elected from among the judges and the Minister of Justice. With two public representatives, one of whom is a lawyer, the parliament and the government will control 7 of the 11 votes on the Judicial Selection Committee and have almost complete control over judicial personnel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, &quot;Netanyahu&#39;s judicial reform&quot; also attempts to weaken the prosecutor general&#39;s judicial decision-making power and transfer power to the cabinet and ministers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/ZqE71W0Je4E4iVyWNFyPb3BYoTz26LPojsvISGKW.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/ZqE71W0Je4E4iVyWNFyPb3BYoTz26LPojsvISGKW.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254451&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On March 27, 2023, people participated in protests on the streets of Tel Aviv, Israel, against Netanyahu&#39;s judicial reforms&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;( Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since Israel has always adopted a very special proportional representation system + cabinet system since the founding of the country, there are many small parties in the parliament. Since the founding of the country, no party has ever been able to rely on a simple majority in the parliament. Obtaining the right to form an independent government, even if the coalition government has little advantage in the parliament (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For example, during the &quot;Aqsa Flood&quot;, the current Netanyahu government &quot;Previously, it only held 65 of the 120 seats in the parliament. The &quot;emergency and war government&quot; that was hastily established after the incident only had 76 seats, of which the Likud group only had 32 seats.&lt;/span >;), often just a few seats are enough to change the &quot;color&quot; of the Israeli cabinet. Therefore, some small far-right, fundamentalist parties with only one or two seats have become &quot;kingmakers&quot; by conditionally supporting Netanyahu. Niyahu and Likud formed a government, pushing the latter, already far right, even further to the right. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The judicial reform came about because Netanyahu and the &quot;kingmakers&quot; hit it off, because through this &quot;reform&quot;, Netanyahu can only rely on single-digit parliamentary seats. Advantages and get rid of the &quot;hunting&quot; of the judicial system, while the far-right and fundamentalist small parties can use the identity and principles of &quot;kingmakers&quot; to achieve &quot;small snacks&quot;, relying on very few seats and votes to make the entire Israeli policy and rule of law Moving in the direction of conservatism, fundamentalism, and Jewish dominance as they envision it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because this &quot;reform&quot; will completely break the balance of the power structure under Israel&#39;s unique system, it will not only give the cabinet and prime minister more unfettered power, but also give small far-right parties with only a few seats It can more easily &quot;hijack&quot; the national economy and people&#39;s livelihood strategies, and even the way society operates, so even within the Likud group, many people disagree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to Netanyahu himself, those who actively promote &quot;reforms&quot; include Justice Minister Yariv Levin, a right-wing cadre of the Likud Group, and Chairman of the Zionist Party (Religious Zionist Party) Simcha Rotman, and the very active group behind it is the &quot;Kohelet Forum&quot; composed of far-right figures from the United States and Israel. The forum&#39;s platform is billed as &quot;ensuring Israel&#39;s future as a Jewish nation-state, strengthening representative democracy, and expanding Israel&#39;s personal freedoms and free market principles.&quot; However, it is actually a group full of fundamental religious overtones. There are only about 130 core members of this group, but they operate dozens of large projects and hundreds of small projects. These plans are uniformly code-named &quot;Barkat Plan&quot; (Barkat Plan), named after the core member of the forum and former Netanyahu Named after Nir Barkat, economic minister in Hu’s cabinet, the aim is to “increase the Jewish population in the biblical heartland of Judea and Samaria” – which means implementing more extreme policies than Netanyahu’s, not just in Settlements are being expanded on Palestinian lands, and Palestinians from these lands must be driven away to make room for Jewish expansion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because of this, these organizations and individuals are even more determined, tough and extreme than Netanyahu in promoting &quot;Netanyahu&#39;s judicial reform&quot;. Netanyahu has repeatedly criticized various They were pressured to make compromises, but were met with angry resistance from these &quot;teammates&quot; every time. In March 2023, the &quot;reformists&quot; passed legislation that significantly raised the threshold for Netanyahu&#39;s impeachment; in July, when the opposition collectively withdrew, they passed a law that abolished the &quot;unreasonable principle&quot;. The first step of &quot;judicial reform&quot; was completed, and in such an important and critical judicial vote, which Netanyahu hailed as &quot;a reflection of the will of the people&quot;, Netanyahu only received 64 votes, which was less than a simple majority (&lt; span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;61 votes&lt;/span>;) only 3 more votes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/0IlQCOc8MmmoloUfCq7g6A0MCwyplOl6ZrhyQaMp.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/0IlQCOc8MmmoloUfCq7g6A0MCwyplOl6ZrhyQaMp.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254452&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 7, 2023, in Gaza City, Palestinians boarded an Israeli military vehicle&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Roaring wave of protests&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Since November 2022, large-scale protests against &quot;Netanyahu&#39;s judicial reform&quot; have been held regularly every weekend in Israel. The scale of the rallies has escalated again and again. Ironically, it was the Hamas attack that broke this continuity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Netanyahu’s opponents say the reforms will seriously undermine the country’s democracy by weakening the judicial system, which is the only instrument limiting the government’s exercise of power. They pointed out that &quot;judicial reform&quot; will ultimately protect Netanyahu, who is currently on trial for alleged corruption, and give the Israeli far right more &quot;lawless&quot;, unfettered and unchecked power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth mentioning that the protestors’ camp includes many members of the military, intelligence, constitutional, special and other key departments that are crucial to the security of Israeli society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Lesley Stahl, a reporter for the CBS political commentary TV magazine &quot;60 Minutes&quot; visited Israel in mid-September 2023, he discovered that tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people had been organizing weekend weekend demonstrations for 37 consecutive weeks. One of the most influential organizations in the judicial reform protest rally is the &quot;Brothers and Sisters in Arms&quot; (Brothers and Sisters in Arms), which is composed entirely of reservists. Ron Scherf, one of the founders of this organization, pointed out that &quot;judicial reform&quot; will Allowing the far right to provoke the Palestinians more unscrupulously will worsen the security situation in Israel, which will put Israeli reservists who are often called to serve in dangerous situations all year round. The organization said an increasing number of Israeli reservists are expressing their dissatisfaction with &quot;judicial reforms&quot; by refusing to fulfill their reserve obligations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 28, 2023, Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi said that “judicial reform” has a profound impact on the military. He told the Times of Israel that “a battle within Israeli society” Arguments that leave polarizing rifts are dangerous,&quot; warning that &quot;given the security challenges, allowing such polarizing debates is arrogant, and assuming that the IDF is immune to damaging polarization is a dangerous concept.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The large-scale boycott of reservists from fulfilling their obligations began after the Knesset passed the first part of the &quot;judicial reform&quot; in July. Due to Israel&#39;s small country and high military pressure, including elite commandos, fighter pilots and other front-line combat forces, Both rely heavily on serving reservists for maintenance. On October 2, Motasem A Dalloul Abujomaa, a writer for the Canadian &quot;Middle East Observer&quot; magazine, quoted a September report from the Israel branch of the Associated Press and pointed out that the Israel Defense Forces are &quot;the most well-equipped and powerful force in the Middle East.&quot; The military is facing one of the most serious attacks it has ever faced - an internal battle, &quot;as rifts caused by &#39;justice reform&#39; seep into the ranks,&quot; the report noted, adding that hundreds of New conscripts also refused to serve in protest against &quot;judicial reform,&quot; leading the article to assert that &quot;it is clear that the army is likely to be caught unawares if any tensions arise&quot;—a prediction that only passed It will be fully redeemed within 5 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Netanyahu’s opponents pointed out that in order to ensure that “judicial reform” received unreserved support from the far-right and small fundamentalist parties, Netanyahu intensified his efforts to impose restrictions on the Palestinian areas after returning to power. High-pressure and even provocative practices, including repeatedly threatening military action against Gaza, assassinating leaders of Hamas and other radical organizations, &quot;targeted killings&quot; of buildings suspected of being resistance strongholds, and demanding that Qatar and other Middle Eastern countries stop providing humanitarian assistance to the poor people in Gaza. , stop paying for fuel for Gaza’s only power plant, require Egypt to tighten restrictions on the Rafah crossing, and stop trade between Gaza and the Israeli mainland, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to Gaza, Netanyahu has also continued to carry out &quot;forced demolitions&quot; in the Palestinian Authority areas of the West Bank, &quot;carried out actions&quot; in sensitive hot spots, expanded and built new settlements, and the West Bank is not Hamas-controlled areas. Opponents further pointed out that these actions have aggravated the conflict between Palestine and Israel and increased Hamas&#39;s support among Palestinians to an unprecedented high. And if it were not for the need to canvass votes for &quot;judicial reform,&quot; Netanyahu would have rarely been so &quot;high-minded&quot; in his previous long political career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/cyCoEHF6ZAWZH5KcAWIAE6MNAl0F5vKOU3YJ5hdb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/cyCoEHF6ZAWZH5KcAWIAE6MNAl0F5vKOU3YJ5hdb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254450&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 16, 2023, at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the Security Council voted on a draft resolution drafted by Russia on humanitarian issues in Gaza. As the United States, Britain, France and other countries voted against, the draft resolution was not passed &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot; It may not be credible, Netanyahu is self-defeating&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After the &quot;Aqsa Flood&quot; occurred, some observers speculated that the military, intelligence, police and other departments that are generally opposed to &quot;judicial reform&quot; may secretly &quot; &quot;Let the water go&quot; in order to embarrass Netanyahu and thereby achieve the purpose of messing up the &quot;judicial reform.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Considering that this battle shattered the myth of Israel&#39;s &quot;invincibility&quot; in one fell swoop, the IDF&#39;s combat capabilities and intelligence system&#39;s early warning capabilities, which had long had a strong aura, were completely destroyed within a few hours. It also caused Israel to suffer the worst attack since the founding of the country. Heavy casualties in a single day and the homeland was attacked. At such a price, it is not just Netanyahu and the administration that have been damaged. The defense forces, intelligence and police systems are also deeply humiliated. Subjectively, the theory of &quot;letting go&quot; may not be credible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen from the performance of the conflict in southern Lebanon and the last two Gaza battles that the combat strength of the Israel Defense Forces is declining, and Israel’s intelligence capabilities rely more on information from the “Jewish world” spread across various industries. terminal, but due to Israel&#39;s long-term policy of &quot;isolating&quot; from Gaza and Hamas, it has lost the &quot;grey zone&quot; cover necessary for intelligence collection and analysis in the Gaza Strip. In addition, Hamas often adopts more primitive communication methods and With a more &quot;flat&quot; organizational system, it is reasonable for the Israeli intelligence agencies to turn a blind eye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The damage caused by the &quot;Aqsa Flood&quot; to Netanyahu and his judicial reforms is also heavy and far-reaching. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As Israeli political analyst Akiva Eldar and others have pointed out, Netanyahu has long been promoting judicial reform by creating a &quot;choose me is to choose security&quot; to win votes for himself The biggest reason is to &quot;consolidate the election results and maintain the security of Israelis&quot;, but now all of this has been completely impacted by the &quot;Aqsa Flood&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An Israeli public television commentator pointed out in the program that Netanyahu advertised &quot;security&quot;, but after the Hamas attack, he delayed for five days before forming an &quot;emergency unity battle&quot; that included the opposition. &quot;If it were other countries, this process would only take 48 hours,&quot; and the Israeli cabinet did not even hold an emergency meeting on the day of the incident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now even many Israelis who have always supported Netanyahu and favored &quot;judicial reform&quot; are beginning to feel hesitant. Rabbi Eliezer Moshea, a Jewish cleric in the Old City of Jerusalem, said that he had been frustrated because of Netanyahu. Niyahu has repeatedly allocated funds to rabbinical schools and enthusiastically supported him and &quot;judicial reform&quot;, but &quot;when our children are being slaughtered and our women are raped, he is helpless, what use can he use the money he gives to the yeshiva?&quot; He has proven unfit to lead this country.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even Michel Ben-Ami, the director of the office responsible for social issues within the Likud Party, told AFP that the &quot;accountability group&quot; established after the war was aimed at the government and Netanyahu. &quot;Investigation committee&quot; is inevitable. &quot;If he makes a mistake, he will have to pay the price for it.&quot; He believes that &quot;accountability investigation is inevitable and is the consensus of the Likud Group today.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;September 27 On March 1, less than two weeks before the &quot;Aqsa Flood&quot; occurred, the Jewish People&#39;s Policy Institute (JPPI) released the &quot;2023 Annual Assessment&quot; stating that &quot;about 37% of Israelis currently hold or plan to obtain foreign passports and intending to immigrate,&quot; arguing that &quot;this alarming figure highlights the deepening crisis in Israel and raises questions about the country&#39;s ability to recover,&quot; and directly placed the blame on &quot;Israel&#39;s judicial reforms and Turbulence in Religious and National Sphere”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report states that the comfort level of Israelis living in Israel has dropped sharply in the past year, with the proportion of people who feel uncomfortable soaring from 20% to 32%, while those who feel comfortable have dropped from 76% to 65% %. Even among supporters of the traditionally more cohesive right, their comfort level dropped from 55% in February 2023 to 43% in July. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nearly 40% of Israelis have considered obtaining a foreign passport and leaving the country, a significant portion of the population, and this number is even higher among conservative Israelis and individuals who themselves hold foreign passports Higher - It must be pointed out that the above data were obtained before the &quot;Aqsa Flood&quot; occurred, otherwise it might be even worse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, many analysts believe that Netanyahu is unlikely to weaken or cancel the intensity of &quot;judicial reform&quot; due to these pressures and setbacks. On the contrary, he is more likely to &quot;brade the wind&quot; to &quot; The reason for &quot;Israel needs a higher security factor&quot; has become even stronger - because if he does not do that, his political life is destined to enter a countdown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 22 Oct 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[不要让县中继续败给“超级中学”丨议教]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259065]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-22 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/22/6kr682xhlhaoattdgoedkgvaown8u2ldwqlomfm.jpg &quot;border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 1192 &quot;&quot; height = &quot;795&quot; data-src = &quot;// images.infzm.com/medias/ima/ima GE/23/10/22/6KR682xhlhaoattdgoedkgvaon8u2ldwqlomfm. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254820&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;February 12, 2017, No. 4 Middle School in Jianhe County, Guizhou. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Leave a message in the comment area for a chance to win a signed book from the author&lt;/span>;&lt; /strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, county education as a whole has gradually entered the vision of academic researchers, policymakers and the public, and has become an important issue of social concern. The latest hot topic is whether small rural schools should continue to exist and invest resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;County education is exactly what our Central China Village Governance Research Team partners and I surveyed in counties and townships in many provinces across the country from May 2017 to June 2023. Previously, apart from a few interviews with primary and secondary school teachers, the Huazhong Rural Governance Research Team rarely touched on rural education issues. Until our research expanded to rural governance and rural sociology, rural education became an important part of investigating and writing village governance reports. Around 2017, rural education became an independent research topic, and our research scope expanded from rural areas to the entire county. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years, our research targets include county and township schools, families, education management departments and grassroots society, trying to analyze a series of emerging phenomena: why the phenomenon of accompanying mothers in county towns is prevalent, and what will happen to them ? What impact do mobile games and online novels have on children in counties and villages? What role does the super high school play in the county? Why have non-teaching tasks in schools increased significantly? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After analyzing these phenomena, we must think about, where is the way out for county and township education? I would like to begin by stating our conclusions. After conducting research in so many places, we have always believed that in the end, it is the county that carries the hope of most children in the county and township. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;A &quot;lose-lose&quot; battle&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Compared with cities, counties are a weak and complex space, which is characterized by weak resources and poor environment in education. complex. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of county education, the development status of county high schools is the most important concern for the development of county education. If the county collapses, local people will lose confidence in the area&#39;s education, thus accelerating population migration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The current county is indeed facing a development crisis, and one of the biggest threats comes from &quot;super high schools&quot;. Super middle schools rely on their own advantages in running schools to attract high-quality students and teachers from the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一些超级中学，会在中考前提前组织对全省县市优秀学生的摸底考试，进入到村社向优秀学生家长进行说服工作，或委托一些中小学教师提前做学生工作，通过高薪吸引县中经验丰富的教师离职高就，等等。超级中学的跨地区招生，更是逐渐侵蚀了县中学生培养的基础结构——县中办学被裹挟其中，不得不被迫通过不断地自我剥削，选择采取一些短期策略行为，比如在时间上极尽投入，将优质资源向少量种子选手过度倾斜，甚至将学生送到某些知名高中“代培”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些县中的选择是不当的，也是无奈的。其无奈之处在于，超级中学依靠自身的多重优势对县中进行了降维打击。然而这种打击却产生了“双输”的结果：县中因优质资源流失压力越来越大；超级中学因优生云集形成过度内卷的局面，学生之间的关系趋于紧张，出现心理问题的学生越来越多，竞争形态从合理范畴转向竞争极化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在县域高中教育的另一端，县域中职教育的发展同样面临着重重困境。一方面，“普职分流”政策愈加引发家长们的焦虑，大多数家长普遍仍然不能接受孩子上中职，为了避免中考落入后50%而想方设法提高成绩，而上了职校的学生，家长则对学生的发展不抱太大希望。另一方面，中职学校因学生基础薄弱、缺乏专业师资、设施设备配套不齐等因素，导致学生培养质量不佳，难以回应市场需求和社会质疑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管国家逐步加大了对中职学校的投入力度，但限于结构性困境，中职学校尤其是县域中职学校的发展举步维艰，一些中职学校在困境中苦苦探索生存发展之路。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“城挤村空”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在人口流动大背景下，农村家庭需要什么样的教育？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;顺着高中向下看，县域初中和小学的发展呈现出“城挤村空”两个极端，在政府“教育新城”建设和社会教育竞争压力之下，教育城镇化的步伐加快，乡村学生不断向城镇学校转移。县城接纳了大量来自农村的学生，但是因农村家庭“半工半耕”的生计模式未见改变，而县城无法承载农村学生进城就读后的生活照料任务，这一任务不得不由家庭自身承担，从而加大了农村家庭进城就读的成本。另一端，大量农村小规模学校的学生人数过少，已然难以维持正常的学生培养，同辈之间的正常交往都无法保证，何谈教书育人、成人成才，且分散的资源布局牵制了县级政府对县域教育资源的有效整合。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;乡村中小学不仅面临着资源是否应该整合以及如何整合的问题，还面临着乡村家庭破碎化带来的问题。留守、离婚、“跑妈”等问题使得乡村青少年的家庭教育缺失，并对学校教育带来一系列挑战。学校面对来自破碎家庭的孩子时，需要花费比来自正常家庭的孩子更多的时间和心力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;家庭教育缺乏，学校要先改变学生们的生活习惯，再来引导学生学习。乡村中小学因家庭教育不足，使得学生基础要比城市学生的更为薄弱，优秀学生的数量也要更少。对于乡镇初中而言，一个非常具体又值得讨论的问题是，是否应该分配重点班。教育公平是应该有教无类还是因材施教？若是有教无类，将所有学生均衡分班，每个班级为数不多的优秀学生可能会被习惯较差的后进生带偏；若是因材施教，将学生分类分到不同类型的班级，又会遭致社会的质疑和政策的问责。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;乡村中小学工作者，常常需要面对这样的两难。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;学校还是一个江湖，县域中小学的江湖特质可以从校园欺凌现象中窥见。校园欺凌的发生，有家庭教育的影响，但更多的是同辈群体在学校结构中互动的结果。学校若形成校园正义秩序，就能够较好地抑制校园欺凌的发生；若学校的正义秩序瓦解，学生就只能依靠自建的丛林秩序进行人际互动，以强凌弱的现象就会发生。遗憾的是，大量学校受到严格的约束，不能轻易对违规违纪学生实施过去年代一些具有威慑力的处罚，校园秩序的重建难度由此更大。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;网络技术的传播和智能手机普及，乡村青少年网络成瘾现象严重，又进一步增加了县域一线教育管理者教育治理的难度。例如，一个女生告诉我们，同学们之间疯传一本描写各式犯罪的网络小说。我们查了一下，相关的评论区里，“社会是阴谋黑森林”“他人即地狱”“罪恶也有理”的观念在该小说读者中相当普遍。这本书已经被学校列为禁书，但同学们私下仍然在传阅。即使不在学校看，假期回家也免不了看一看。 &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;青春期的孩子有着这个阶段独特的精神需求。我们发现，这个时期孩子们看小说，不是在吸收知识，而是在寻找自我以及成长的力量。他们很容易将自己以及对现实生活的体会带入所阅读的小说里。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;向上的希望&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在极为复杂的教育情境之下，县域各阶段学校的管理者和一线教师仍然在努力探索和积极改变。他们尝试引导、教育和改变来自破碎家庭的孩子、逾越规矩的孩子、心理脆弱的孩子，想为乡村孩子谋求安静的学习环境，却往往被僵化的规则束缚住手脚。尤其是，他们还需要抵抗自身的“被围困”，各种非教学工作挤压教育时间，使得他们不得不呐喊“请还教师一个安静的教书环境”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;至此，我们更多看到县域教育难堪的一面，但在一线调研中我们同样看到，县域教育也不乏积极和希望。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了争分夺秒争取学习时间，有的孩子只给自己20分钟吃饭时间，有的孩子在吃饭的路上还带着笔记本，有的孩子挑灯夜读日夜奋战。当我们用同情的眼光看待他们时，他们却回以坚定的眼神。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;还有一些教师，为了减轻学生家庭因素的负面影响，常常陪伴、倾听，给予他们关爱。湖南隆回县雨山中学优秀班主任黄华菊，根据乡村学生的特点实施了“陪伴式教育法”。她观察到一个成绩不好的女孩性格内向，之后了解到该学生曾经离家出走，原因是母亲的家庭暴力。黄老师就经常跟女孩谈心，并邀请她一起吃饭，特意表达出“偏爱”，通过种种方式帮助女孩建立自信。乡村学校中不乏黄老师的存在，他们会探索各种有利于学生成长的教育方法。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一些学校管理者敢于改革，设法激活教师和学生，一改学校发展颓势。四川成都的一所乡镇学校曾在全市排名倒数，2019年上任的年轻校长通过改革重振旗鼓，使得一所垂死挣扎的学校实现“逆风翻盘”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也不乏拼命为孩子创造更好教育条件的乡村家长。在政策难以回应诉求时，他们通过“自救”以求改变。有人放弃工作和原来的生活，在城镇租房陪读，有人花费巨资将孩子送进私立学校，他们有一个共同点：尽力为孩子创造更好的教育环境。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管县乡教育存在诸多发展问题，尽管县乡教育资源更加稀缺，面临的情景比城市更加复杂，但向上的希望是不能破灭的。未来县域教育的发展，不仅需要政策倾斜弥补县域教育发展的短板，还需要通过制度建设激活县乡学校已有资源和比较优势，培养孩子们获得未来选择的能力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;基于这些调研，我们写成了《县乡的孩子们》一书，以案例的形式呈现学校的运转、教师的想法、家长的诉求、学生的心态、政策的执行等教育一线状况，探寻县域教育的现状、问题、前途。 &lt;/p>;

title=&quot;一个13岁农村少年的杀机与青春&quot;>;一个13岁农村少年的杀机与青春&lt;/a>;》这篇报道在采访时，我时常心里感到难受。事发湖南常宁，一个偏远地区的小城市，一名未满14岁的男孩杀害邻居11岁女童，抛尸湘江。这是这则新闻最初的信息，男孩面目模糊，只知道年龄和基本的家庭构成。我有了“马上去趟常宁”的念头，想知道寥寥数语背后，他有着怎样的家庭背景和成长轨迹。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;看过许多未成年犯罪报道，印象最深的是一起未成年人纵火案。在2016年的广西浦北县，3个少年在凌晨的街头遇到一名流浪汉，将汽油洒在对方身上，将火点着，导致对方严重烧伤，是充满恶意的即兴行为，而他们年龄最大的只有14岁。个案也有着令人唏嘘的背景原因。还原他们的故事，洞察环境因素、家庭教育等的影响，或许能为此类未成年犯罪事件保留警示底本。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这一次，一场杀人抛尸的凶案发生在村里，牵扯进两户艰难生存的家庭，和他们留守在家的孩子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;到了村里，我能深刻理解到，他们的家长不得不外出打工的无奈：交通不便，土地稀少，留在村里也挣不到钱。我去过很多不同的村子，这两个家庭的家具、家电是最简陋的之一，肉眼可见这两家人的经济条件都较差。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;虽然两个孩子都是留守儿童，但是他们和家人之间的亲密度全然不同。女孩的父母会在社交平台放她和哥哥的照片，还有女儿参加“六一”文艺汇演时跳舞的视频。即便一家人因为打工分居三地，也会频繁地进行视频通话。奶奶对她在学校的表现也很清楚，跳舞、练字、画画，在采访中，时不时拿来一张奖状或一本练习册。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从心理层面上，在女孩的童年教育中，家长并未完全缺位。男孩的家庭细节在报道中已多有呈现，家长更多的是“无可奈何”，他们面对我时，很是友善礼貌，但言辞之中，更多的是“我也没有办法”“我只能做这么多了”，原因很多：年老、生病、穷。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有一个细节令我印象深刻，男孩的外公外婆对作案动机毫无头绪，但说着说着，外公却突然斩钉截铁地说，发生这样的事情，完全是手机害的。但外孙平日里会用手机做什么，他说不上来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;男孩是初三才拥有手机，此前没手机的日子里，就看着别人玩，有手机后就抱着不肯撒手。我在2023年3月曾经和武汉大学副教授夏柱智聊过留守儿童的手机沉迷问题，他们的课题组发现九成农村留守儿童长期使用专属手机或长辈手机玩耍，他们拥有很多空余时间，大多数时候都没人管束，缺乏陪伴，很难拒绝手机的诱惑。对这些留守儿童来说，他们面临大量扑面而来的未经筛选的互联网信息。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但即便如此，也很难说“玩手机”就是这件事的问题根源。男孩外公的那句“完全是手机害的”，在我的理解中，更多的是这种绝望冲击之下的茫然与无奈。面对外部世界的冲击，老人没有办法用传统的方式应对和教育孩子。同时，家长也并未看到自己的责任，对他们来说，散养可能是正常的带娃方式，吃饱穿暖似乎就够了，他们不太适应这个有手机的年代。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;跟男孩的家人、同学都聊过之后，我才逐渐感知到男孩所处环境的孤独与单调。像他这个年龄的少年，认知世界、习得规则主要是通过家庭和学校，但他比同龄人更早入学，在学校有被霸凌的经历，性格有些唯唯诺诺，在家里不爱跟人沟通，跟外公外婆也没什么话说，因此，他似乎没能在家庭和学校习得这些技能。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他在乡镇做住校生，所处的环境贫穷而封闭，少有人为他张罗未来，也没有小镇做题家这种通过读书出人头地的机会。不惟他一个人，他身边的同学也面临着“被剩下”的县中孩子危机。我接触的男同学，在教育体系不断分流、筛选过程中，是被筛下来的那一批。在他们的叙述中，老师可以不加掩饰地表达“看不起”的意思，许多学生处于“半放弃”的状态。临近升学的一年，他们也没有紧锣密鼓的冲刺阶段，而是各有各的活法，请假、逃课、打架、上课玩手机，相当比例的人要去读职校，甚至有人碍于生计和家人意愿，连职校也没钱去读。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是一个令人忧心的认知，比这个凶杀案更值得社会关心。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 22 Oct 2023 14:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[紫薯不是红薯，不能免高速费？绿色通道不是一道生物分类题丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259071]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-22 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Why are the same purple sweet potatoes treated differently at different high-speed toll stations? A recent news has once again attracted attention to the green channel policy for agricultural products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Morning News, recently, when a truck driver, Mr. Li, was driving off the expressway from Nanying, Yicheng City, Hubei Province, he was told that the purple sweet potato he was pulling was not in the catalog of fresh agricultural products, and he was charged 900 yuan. Travel expenses. When he got off the expressway from Nanchang, Jiangxi and Ezhou, Hubei, the toll collectors believed that purple sweet potatoes were fresh agricultural products and could enjoy the green channel policy for agricultural products without charging tolls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Li was puzzled by this and posted a video complaint online. In this regard, the person in charge of Nanying Toll Station said that they strictly follow the &quot;Catalogue of Fresh Agricultural Products Varieties&quot; formulated by the Ministry of Transport, the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. Purple sweet potato is not in the catalog. Therefore, you cannot enjoy the green pass policy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It seems that this explanation makes sense. A notice issued by the four ministries and commissions at the end of 2022 stated that &quot;sweet potato&quot; is one of the fresh vegetables that can enjoy the green pass policy, and the &quot;aliases and common trade names&quot; of sweet potato include &quot;sweet potato, sweet potato, white potato, sweet potato, sweet potato, sweet potato, red taro&quot; &quot;Wait, &quot;Purple Sweet Potato&quot; is indeed not among them. The Ministry of Transport also made it clear when responding to inquiries on the official website that &quot;purple sweet potatoes&quot; are not included in the &quot;Catalogue of Fresh Agricultural Products Varieties&quot; and are not agricultural products that enjoy the preferential policies of the &quot;green channel&quot;. However, this reply was made in October 2020, 2 years earlier than the new notice at the end of 2022. From this reply alone, we cannot conclude that &quot;the 2022 version of the new fresh agricultural product catalog does not include purple sweet potatoes.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the domestic trade industry standard SB/T10029-2012 &quot;Fresh Vegetable Classification and Code&quot; issued by the Ministry of Commerce, sweet potato (also known as potato, sweet potato, sweet potato) and purple potato are indeed divided into different categories. But they are all &quot;fresh vegetables&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the catalog of fresh agricultural products refers to the industry standards of the Ministry of Commerce, it lists more aliases for sweet potatoes in order to minimize possible disputes. However, sweet potatoes and purple potatoes are similar in appearance. The only difference is that purple potatoes are purple in color, and they are both fresh vegetables according to the standards of the Ministry of Commerce. Why do they enjoy different treatment? No wonder disputes often arise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, if we strictly follow botanical classification, the standards of the Ministry of Commerce and the catalog of fresh agricultural products published by the four ministries may not be accurate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to information from the website &quot;Plant Intelligence&quot; hosted by the Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, sweet potato, commonly known as sweet potato, belongs to the genus Magnoliaceae-Lily subclass-Dioscoreales-Dioscoreaceae-Dioscorea in plant taxonomy. A species. The scientific name of the commonly known &quot;sweet potato&quot; is actually &quot;sweet potato&quot;, which is a species under the genus Magnoliacea-Rosoda-Solanales-Convolvulaceae-Tiger Palm Vine. Sweet potatoes also have common names such as goose, white potato, sweet potato, sweet potato, sweet potato, yam, sweet potato, potato, jade pillow potato, Tang potato, red potato, red yam, Ganchu, fanru, golden potato, sweet potato, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to this, although sweet potato and sweet potato are often considered to be different common names for the same plant in daily life, from a botanical classification point of view, sweet potato and sweet potato belong to different subclasses and are actually very distantly related. of two species. On the contrary, sweet potatoes and morning glories belong to the genus Tiger Palm and are close relatives. Purple sweet potato is only a subspecies of sweet potato in botanical classification. According to the common name, it should be included in &quot;sweet potato&quot;. Sweet potato is one of the common names of sweet potato, and taxonomically speaking, sweet potato and sweet potato are two very different species, which is indeed confusing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although &quot;purple potatoes are not sweet potatoes&quot;, &quot;hot peppers are not peppers&quot;, &quot;baby cabbage is not cabbage&quot;, &quot;cherries are not cherries&quot; and &quot;cherry tomatoes are not tomatoes&quot; often cause ridicule on social networks, but these The differences between the different names of fresh crops in botany, the Ministry of Commerce’s trade standards, the catalog of fresh agricultural products, and the public’s daily cognition are not the root cause of the dispute over the Green Pass policy. Many times, even for agricultural products whose variety classification is not controversial, toll stations will refuse to implement the green pass policy on the grounds of &quot;not fresh&quot; or &quot;extensively processed&quot; and require payment of fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why do toll stations try to find ways to charge card drivers and not give free access to agricultural product transport vehicles? The reason is naturally to reduce losses as much as possible. Currently, the tolls exempted from the green pass for agricultural products are borne by highway operating companies. This is not a small amount of money. According to the &quot;2021 National Toll Road Statistical Bulletin&quot; released by the Ministry of Transport, the &quot;green channel&quot; of national toll roads will reduce tolls by 27.47 billion yuan in 2021, and the reduction in 2019 will reach 35.08 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The green pass policy was introduced by the state to reduce the circulation costs of agricultural products. The expenses thus reduced should have been borne by the government. In 2009, the Ministry of Transport and the National Development and Reform Commission stated in relevant notices on the comprehensive implementation of the green toll policy that the impact of green tolls on commercial toll road companies should be studied, and those with a greater impact would be compensated as appropriate; new batches of tolls When building highway projects, the impact of green traffic must be fully considered and traffic flow reasonably determined. In 2019, relevant ministries and commissions once again proposed to conduct an in-depth assessment of the implementation effects and impacts of the green pass policy, and formulate specific plans to compensate for the loss of legitimate income of toll road operating units caused by the optimization policy. However, these &quot;research&quot; and &quot;evaluation&quot; have so far produced no results, and all the costs of the free green pass have been borne by the toll road operating companies. Without financial compensation, the toll station will naturally have to worry about every detail, trying to provide as little free service as possible and charge as much as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the green pass for agricultural products, there are many other toll-free policies, such as free passenger cars on holidays, which have also had a great impact on the income of highway companies. According to the statistical bulletin of the Ministry of Transport, 38.07 billion yuan in tolls for small passenger vehicles will be exempted during major holidays in 2021, which is more than 10 billion yuan more than the tolls exempted under the Green Pass for agricultural products. The total vehicle toll revenue from national toll roads that year was only 663.05 billion. Yuan, with these two reduction and exemption policies alone, the tolls collected are close to 10% of the total revenue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The basic logic is who pays the bill. Nowadays, the policy is treating the guests, but it is the enterprises that foot the bill, and the promised compensation to the enterprises has yet to be received. Naturally, when companies pay bills, they have to make careful calculations and worry about every detail to avoid losses as much as possible. Therefore, the fundamental way to put an end to green-pass policy disputes is to straighten out the entire mechanism and fully compensate highway operation managers. With the popularization of electronic toll collection methods such as ETC, these are no longer technically difficult. We can also explore more ways to reduce logistics costs, such as directly issuing freight subsidies to transporters or wholesalers of fresh agricultural products, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 22 Oct 2023 13:25:08 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[出门旅游住急诊省钱？怎么把“假病人”送出医院？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259041]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-22 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 22 Oct 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[丈夫跳槽后，一位44岁大学女老师的“不情愿辞职”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259067]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-22 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/22/96CwRqxG7lxy2ftciXbg9N6ki1OyoPwI0rhTGySK.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;954&quot; height=&quot;874&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/22/96CwRqxG7lxy2ftciXbg9N6ki1OyoP wI0rhTGySK. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254821&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Nongjian/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just after Teachers&#39; Day in 2023, a former female university teacher told social media about her experience of being &quot;tied and resigned&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the narration, Yao Xue (pseudonym), the former associate professor of the Academy of Fine Arts of Linyi University, encountered a difficult choice in his 17th year of work. My husband, who works at the same college, received a job opportunity from a 985 university, but the &quot;release&quot; conditions issued by the school&#39;s human resources office were that the husband&#39;s transfer must be approved and the wife must voluntarily resign. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yao Xue said that this request shattered her more than ten years of hard work. &quot;In their eyes, if I have any value, why don&#39;t they care?&quot; In the end, she chose to fulfill her husband. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 19, 2022, she signed the dismissal letter and changed from a university associate professor to an unemployed wife. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yao Xue provided documents such as recordings of conversations with relevant persons in charge of the school and college, social media communication records, and letters of dismissal as proof. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind the case is a road that is not smooth for the mobility of teachers in Chinese universities. In order to retain teachers, universities often refuse them on the grounds that the service period has not expired, graduate guidance and project work have not been completed, or they file claims for high liquidated damages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Jin, a doctoral supervisor at the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at Beijing Institute of Technology, has been studying the phenomenon of university teacher mobility for many years. He found that in the West, it is normal for university teachers to &quot;change jobs&quot;, but in Asia it has become more serious. Specific to East Asia, the mobility ratio of university teachers in China is lower than that in Japan and South Korea. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Resigned unwillingly&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Yao Xue, 44 years old, on September 11, 2023, she posted on her personal WeChat account that had been suspended for a year and a half. She published a long article on her blog, describing the heart-wrenching Teacher&#39;s Day she had just experienced: Her former students sent blessings on Teacher&#39;s Day as they did in previous years, but she was unable to tell the story of what happened during last summer vacation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The story begins in 2005. Yao Xue and Yang Mu both graduated from a normal university with master&#39;s degrees and joined Linyi Normal University (now Linyi University). After that, they got married and had children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Mu later studied for an on-the-job doctorate and published nearly forty papers and three monographs in 17 years, developing upwards. In 2021, Yang Mu received a job opportunity from a 985 university. In the same year, Yao Xue was finally promoted to associate professor. Different from her husband&#39;s development trajectory, she has taught at least 16 professional courses from sketching plaster statues, oil painting landscapes to basic design, and also opened a general aesthetic education course for all students in the school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The career development of both of them will change in 2021, and their lives seem to be going to the next level. Yao Xue plans to stay in Linyi if her husband goes to work in another city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But from the time they received the job offer to Linyi University’s final release, the couple struggled with the school for half a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obtaining a transfer letter from a 985 university is only the first step. Inter-school transfers of university teachers must obtain the consent of their department or college, and then report to the personnel department for approval. In the case of professors, the transfer process usually needs to be discussed and approved by the school party committee before the transfer process can be initiated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Academy of Fine Arts first rejected Yang Mu’s transfer request. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There were not many opportunities to discuss transfer applications at the meeting. After missing it at the end of 2021, Yang Mu spent half a year in constant communication, hoping to seize the meeting in mid-2022. Just a week before the meeting, the party secretary of the college, who had already relented, conveyed the opinion of the Human Resources Department to Yang Mu: You want to be transferred and your wife wants to resign. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yao Xue said that she was &quot;stunned&quot; at that time and she tried to prove to the school that &quot;she was valuable.&quot; During her teaching career, her oil paintings won nearly ten competition awards and exhibition opportunities. &quot;If the school wants to eliminate old teachers, it will never pass on people like me through normal assessment.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yao Xue originally thought that the school felt that her husband’s transfer would affect her work. She sent a text message to the director of the Human Resources Department to express her attitude: “As a teacher at Linhua University, I have my own professional ethics and career pursuits. Since then, I have worked diligently in teaching and scientific research and have never slackened off.&quot; He also emphasized that whether Yang Mu stays or goes, it will not affect her working status. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The other party’s reply was to ask Yao Xue and his wife to “understand the school’s desire for talents and the demand for talents in the construction of first-level disciplines and majors.” Moreover, the school also has rules and regulations for the normal flow of talents. “We need to Follow the prescribed procedures.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a recording provided by Yao Xue, the other party said that the school has the social responsibility to maintain family harmony and stability, and &quot;does not encourage, do not advocate, and in principle do not engage in separation between the two places.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Service period, scientific research completion and high compensation&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;What obstacles may a university teacher encounter if he wants to be transferred? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After talking to several teachers who have experienced the &quot;difficulty of changing jobs&quot;, Zhang Duanhong, associate professor at the Institute of Higher Education of Tongji University, learned about a &quot;chain&quot;: the principal, the vice president in charge of human resources, the director of the personnel department, the dean, Secretary, everyone on this line must pay close attention and communicate frequently. A teacher interviewed told Zhang Duanhong: &quot;You must not seek for speed, you must significantly reduce your time expectations.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Duanhong analyzed that in communicating with different departments, teachers have to go back and forth and complete their own teaching work. In the end, Physically and mentally exhausted, the mobilization matter fell into place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the difficulty in successfully completing the transfer procedures, teachers have to &quot;change jobs&quot; and the costs they bear include returning the allocated housing and facing huge claims for compensation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike Yao Xue&#39;s forbearance, Southern Weekend reporters checked the referee documents website and found that some teachers hope to use the law to get rid of their original units. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma, a former professor at Yangzhou University Law School, sued the school in 2020 because he wanted to be transferred to Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, but Yangzhou University would not let him go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The relevant judgment shows that Ma mentioned that in April 2020, the registration deadline set by the new unit was approaching, but Yangzhou University Law School refused to sign and release him on the grounds of &quot;college development&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma was introduced to Yangzhou University in November 2011 and has served for eight years. Yangzhou University argued that his service period had not ended - Ma signed agreements in 2013 and 2019 when he obtained the qualifications for higher-level professional and technical positions and the fourth-level professional and technical positions, corresponding to 8 years and 3 years respectively. During the working period, one must &quot;perform the service period honestly and trustworthy&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Scientific research and projects are another means of &quot;stuck&quot; people. In a ruling issued by the Anning District Court of Lanzhou City, Gansu University of Political Science and Law disagreed with the departure of a teacher because the graduate students he supervised had not yet graduated and his own scientific research project had not yet been completed. The school believes that his resignation will &quot;seriously affect the completion of the ongoing research project&quot; and that failure to complete the project on time &quot;will inevitably affect Gansu University of Political Science and Law&#39;s future project application work.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some teachers are required to pay a considerable amount of compensation when they leave their original school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;China Science News&quot; once reported that in 2013, after Hu, a teacher at Nanchang Institute of Technology, obtained a doctorate on the job, he signed a new agreement with the school to continue teaching at Nanchang Institute of Technology until June 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the expiration of the service period, Hu applied for resignation and transfer. However, Nanchang Institute of Technology formulated the &quot;Interim Regulations on Personnel Deployment (Revised)&quot; in 2018, which stipulates that teachers at the school need to extend their employment for 5 years after being awarded the title of professor. Annual service period. Hu was promoted to professor in 2016. When he resigned, he still had 2 years and 2 months of unfinished service. He had to pay compensation, which was calculated based on &quot;the average annual pre-tax income in the past three years multiplied by the unfinished service period.&quot; , totaling nearly 440,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is also a situation where university teachers study for a Ph.D. while on the job, and after graduation &quot;look for another job&quot;, but are blocked by their original school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters searched the Judgment Documents Network and found that Linyi University had sued Xue Li, a teacher at the school&#39;s law school, demanding liquidated damages of 300,000 yuan and other expenses. In 2016, Xue Li went to Heilongjiang University to study for a Ph.D., and Linyi University signed a &quot;Non-directional Doctoral Training Contract&quot; with her. According to the contract, Xue Li will be responsible for all expenses during her studies. The school will pay her salary in the form of a loan. After Xue Li obtains her doctorate, she must report back to Linyi University on time. If she is transferred during the service period, the borrowed salary and reimbursement will be borne by her. After the funds are written off according to the actual number of months of service, the balance will be returned to the school in full, and a penalty of 300,000 yuan will be paid. After Xue Li graduated, she joined Anyang Normal University. Linyi University then demanded that Xue Li return the &quot;borrowed wages&quot; and pay liquidated damages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the &quot;couple bundling&quot; method of retaining people, Yang Mu and Yao Xue were indeed caught off guard. Southern Weekend reporters interviewed several scholars who study the mobility of university teachers, and they also said they had heard of it for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But there is one exception. Liu Jin added that if the school provides a job for the spouse of a college teacher when the teacher is introduced, then whether the spouse’s job will be retained after the employee leaves the job must be based on the written agreement at the time of talent introduction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to ensure that the introduced talents have no worries, colleges and universities usually &quot;assist&quot; their spouses in solving their problems. The intensity of &quot;assistance&quot; depends on the talent&#39;s own ability level and the spouse&#39;s own academic qualifications. Southern Weekend reporters noticed that Huangshan University’s 2023 talent introduction plan mentioned that “if high-level talents leave, their spouses must leave at the same time.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yao Xue said that she was unmarried when she joined the company as a master&#39;s student in 2005 and lived in a single dormitory, which did not fall into the category of &quot;disposed of work.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Duanhong found that teachers rarely resolve obstacles encountered during transfer through judicial channels. The main reason is that they are afraid of breaking up with their original units and leaving a bad reputation. However, according to a review of the judgment documents website, it can be found that the court usually fully considers the position of university teachers. In the aforementioned lawsuits related to Yangzhou University and Gansu University of Political Science and Law, the court ruled that the teacher should terminate the personnel contract relationship with the original school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Xue Li&#39;s case, the court held that Xue Li assumed the responsibility of a university teacher and the salary she received was labor remuneration, and Xue Li&#39;s admission to the &quot;non-directed training doctorate&quot; meant that her future workplace was uncertain. , a two-way choice will be implemented after graduation. Therefore, Xue Li only needs to refund the social insurance and provident fund paid by Linyi University after joining Anyang Normal University. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Brain drain, the dilemma of colleges and universities&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Why are colleges and universities &quot;stuck&quot; at all levels? This is closely related to the development difficulties and teacher shortages that schools will face after the brain drain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Universities in the central and western regions were once the areas hardest hit by the loss of teachers. In March 2020, Zhao Xudong, then director of the Teacher Affairs Department of the Party Committee of Lanzhou University of Technology, revealed to the media: According to incomplete statistics, 49 universities in Gansu Province lost 2,600 talents from 2012 to 2017, which is about one-third of the number of introduced talents. one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Liu Jin found that in the past 10 years, there has been an &quot;inflection point&quot; in the mobility of teachers in eastern and western universities: the participation of teachers in western universities has greatly reduced, and has been replaced by local or international teacher mobility in eastern universities. In recent years, this trend has become more obvious. Liu Jin analyzed that perhaps eastern universities prefer star scholars with academic competitiveness and reputation, while the brain drain of western universities has reached a plateau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar to Yang Mu, the core logic of teacher mobility in colleges and universities today is &quot;people go to higher places.&quot; In &quot;double-non&quot; colleges and universities, teachers have a strong desire to move. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Jin found that income is not the most important factor affecting the mobility of college teachers. Their pursuit of academic prestige sometimes makes up for the lack of income. Choosing a higher-ranked school is exactly the way to improve academic prestige. way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At Linyi University, the dilemma of brain drain is equally real and needs to be solved urgently. The school’s “14th Five-Year Plan” mentioned that “there is still a shortage of leading academic talents, young academic talents and high-level innovative teams, and the brain drain in some disciplines is serious.” In 2019, Li Yingkui, then deputy director of the Personnel Office of Linyi University, wrote an analysis that the school had no advantages in terms of schooling level and geography, and had long lacked sufficient funds to introduce high-end talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A teacher who taught at the school from 2017 to 2021 revealed that many teachers with doctoral degrees resigned at the school. The teacher said that he was required to hand in his doctoral diploma when he joined the job. and original degree certificate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The school had more realistic considerations in the transfer of Yang Mu and his wife. According to Yao Xue, the director of the Human Resources Department once mentioned to Yang Mu, &quot;I heard that I will apply for a master&#39;s degree next year. If you leave, it will be ruined.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The official website of the Academy of Fine Arts of Linyi University shows that the academy held a promotion meeting for the construction of professional master&#39;s degree programs in April 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This puzzled Yao Xue. She explained that what the college applied for this time was a professional master&#39;s degree, not an academic master&#39;s degree. Yang Mu&#39;s achievements were all theoretical articles, and it was useless to apply for a professional master&#39;s degree. &quot;On the contrary, I, as a member of the tutor team applying for the master&#39;s degree, was the only one under 45 years old. As an associate professor and technical teacher, my results are useful.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a document issued by the National Art Professional Degree Graduate Education Steering Committee, Southern Weekend reporters noted that the Education Steering Committee’s guidance on professional degree The requirement for direction instructors is that they “must have educational background and practical experience in the major they are guiding.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Zhang Duanhong’s view, making it more difficult for colleges and universities to “change jobs” is not necessarily to keep anyone, but more “to slow down the flow of talent and balance it with the speed of recruitment.” He pointed out that if universities really want to retain students, they should create better working conditions for teachers. If teachers are allowed to &quot;leave with love,&quot; they will try their best to give back to the school in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Jin encountered examples of &quot;peaceful breakup&quot; in his research. After a teacher &quot;changed jobs&quot;, the doctoral students and postdocs he taught at the original school still studied with him. This teacher also regularly goes to the original school to participate in academic activities and secures many resources for the school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why is free academic mobility a good thing? After reviewing the history of European medieval universities, Liu Jin found that the difficulty in mobility of graduates from low-prestige universities had attracted the attention of the authorities and promoted the establishment of teacher licensing and degree-granting normative systems, while academic mobility was mostly based on prototype universities. Derivative universities are mainly based on outward transportation and radiation, and are built through mobility. Since most academic career subjects come from prototype universities, it also drives the transmission of academic career norms, thereby maintaining a high level of standardization in the entire industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters contacted the director of the Human Resources Department of Linyi University, hoping to learn about the other party&#39;s request for Yao Xue to resign. The other party said that he would contact the school&#39;s Propaganda Department. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of press time, the Propaganda Department of Linyi University had not responded to interview requests. During the call, a staff member expressed that he did not want to create more pressure on Teacher (Yao Xue). &quot;We are protecting the teacher (attitude). Although she has resigned now, she is still our alumnus.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The &quot;tied&quot; spouse&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Yao Xue does not want the focus of the incident to be shifted to the couple, let alone Wanting to be considered a &quot;hostage of her husband.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident was posted on the Internet, she responded to almost every question raised by netizens. One of them is: &quot;You don&#39;t need to look to know that his wife is a buy one, get one free.&quot; &quot;Buy one, get one free&quot; refers to the aforementioned situation of introducing talents to solve the spouse&#39;s work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yao Xue commented: They do not believe that a female teacher has independent value and dignity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In her narration, she had a rich and enviable life: after graduating from her undergraduate degree, she was recommended to become the first batch of master&#39;s students at her alma mater; in the past 17 years, her teaching quality evaluation has been excellent 13 times; she could have gone to Zhejiang, Guangdong and other more economically developed regions. But when she applied for Linyi University, the old secretary of the Fine Arts Department received her. As soon as they met, he held her hand and said, &quot;Thank you for supporting the construction of our old district.&quot; This immediately aroused her sense of responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yao Xue’s life before resigning could indeed be called “quiet years.” Most of her Weibo is filled with cats, school, and the growth of her children. She also worries about the difficulty of publishing papers and applying for projects as a teacher at a local college, so much so that she prays for success in her projects and papers during some holidays. . When her husband, who has written a lot of books, calls her a scientific expert, she will laugh at herself as a &quot;scientific researcher&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Amid the &quot;difficulty in mobility&quot; of university teachers, the situation of female teachers may be even more complicated. In a study on gender differences in teacher mobility at research universities that Liu Jin participated in, the mobility frequency of female teachers at 11 universities including Peking University was significantly lower than that of men. One of the reasons is that female scholars are very worried about being treated differently in terms of income and other aspects during the migration process. A study by a foreign scholar mentioned that female university teachers will lose 8% of their income when they change jobs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Hui, executive deputy director of the Gender Equality Research Center of Yangzhou University, found that gender differential treatment in colleges and universities is not obvious, but it will become apparent at critical moments related to career advancement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After analyzing the performance of male and female teachers at Yangzhou University in terms of scientific research results, professional titles, etc., Yang Hui proposed that teachers’ professional achievements have become gender stratified. For example, women are less common among high-end scientific research groups and high-level administrative managers. . In a 2022 article, Bai Ling, a lecturer at the School of Educational Sciences at Bohai University, studied the teaching staff of a local university and found that male teachers published more papers in Journal C (referring to journals included in the &quot;Chinese Social Sciences Citation Index&quot;) than Female teachers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Yang Hui’s view, once a woman is constrained in childbearing and parenting in a dual-career family that is originally synchronized, the career achievement gap will easily be widened by her partner. In a conversation with the person in charge of the Human Resources Department, Yao Xue learned that there was a teacher couple in a certain college of the school who were in a similar situation at the same time. My husband was going to be transferred to a university in Shanghai, but “my family members refused to leave, and now they have also resigned together.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Yao Xue, the wife graduated from Peking University with a master&#39;s and doctoral degree. On the day when Yang Mu went to school to stamp the last chapter on his resignation procedures, he met the husband who had applied for transfer. The other party told him that his wife had joined the school a year earlier than him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters tried to contact the couple, but the male teacher refused to be interviewed. He said that his wife was not &quot;blackmailed&quot; when she resigned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another netizen left a message: &quot;What I don&#39;t understand is why in both couples, the husband was promoted and the wife was &#39;resigned&#39;. Is it a coincidence or is it really more difficult for women to be promoted and transferred?&quot; Yao Xue admitted: &quot;It may be both. The situation between the two of us is indeed because my spouse&#39;s scientific research ability is much better than mine.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Yao Xue, 44 is an embarrassing age. . When she graduated in 2005, there were still very few master&#39;s degrees in art, and a large number of colleges and universities offered favorable conditions to recruit students. But now the situation has changed. Colleges and universities generally recruit teachers with a Ph.D. degree. As for vocational schools that value practicality, they prefer teachers majoring in design, film and television, and animation.

These things are very intensive. There are a lot of good things, but also a lot of bloody plots. Due to differences in customs, conflicting concepts, and disagreements in language, small things often become big problems, causing lovers to quarrel or even break up on bad terms. After the holidays, such complaints can be seen everywhere on social platforms. Reading these words, it seems that you can gain a lot just by eating melon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, I saw such a hotly debated incident: a pair of newlyweds visited each other&#39;s elderly. First, the elderly in the woman&#39;s family gave the man a red envelope of 2,000 yuan. Then he visited the man&#39;s house, and the man&#39;s parents gave the woman 2,600 yuan, which was slightly more, and seemed fine. Unexpectedly, the woman&#39;s brother and sister-in-law were obstructing the situation. They thought the man&#39;s gift was too little and demanded that the gift be doubled in accordance with local customs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The man thinks it is unreasonable and the woman thinks there is no empathy and consideration. There was a quarrel, the boyfriend and girlfriend blamed each other, each was disappointed, and finally broke up. There are a lot of tragicomedies like this available on the Internet, and there are many more bloody ones than this one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first level of analysis is very simple, it depends on who is causing trouble for no reason or making trouble unreasonably. The woman&#39;s family must obviously bear the responsibility - the brother and sister-in-law are not parents, but they interfere in the sister&#39;s private affairs on the grounds of customs, which is really too lenient. They are suspected of being greedy for money and profit. If such character is not maintained, there will be trouble. Many people congratulate the man for this, saving him a lot of trouble in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second level of analysis: young people fall in love and get married, there are all kinds of frictions, and the deepest collision is values. Values ​​cannot be consistent, and all kinds of things wrapped up in romantic love and personality congeniality will melt away sooner or later. When a man and a woman are in love, especially when discussing marriage, both parties may wish to be more brave and show their personal values. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the concept is the same, there will be resonance. The prospective couple or husband and wife will appreciate and respect each other, and the relationship will develop in depth. This is the basis for the lasting and harmonious family relationship. If you have different views, you might as well communicate more and seek to get closer to each other. If the differences are too big, they will break up at best, which is a good thing in the long run. Under this post, many people came to express their congratulations - it was a good break for the two people who had deep differences in their views. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a new family, the husband and wife are of the same mind and can avoid internal divisions. How do they avoid external disturbances, especially interference from their parents and families? This is the third level of analysis that we will focus on next. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Chinese family life, from discussing marriage to getting married, buying a house, and having and raising children, the elders have a great say, but most of them are stubborn. This is a distress faced by many Chinese families. On the one hand, young couples are dissatisfied with their elders. They think they have old-fashioned ideas, weird ideas, lack of skills, are picky and complain, and interfere indiscriminately. On the other hand, the elders also criticize the younger generation a lot, thinking that they are rude, heartless, turn their elbows outward, extravagant and wasteful, lazy and arrogant, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We are used to seeing such conflicts: every time we enter a new stage of life, new points of family conflict will appear. It ranges from despising small quarrels to falling apart at worst. Many people think that once the house purchase bill is passed, everything will be solved. However, the conflicts have not disappeared. As money is collected to buy a house and the elderly take care of their children, family conflicts become more intense. In comparison, disputes over red envelopes before marriage are so trivial that they can be ignored. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To resolve it, it is actually very simple. A new family is financially independent from the moment it is formed. Don’t be greedy for betrothal gifts and dowry, and don’t put a burden on your parents and family. It sounds incredible, but in fact, most of our parents&#39; generation got married with nothing. At that time, the income was still low, and most people worked hard just to have food and clothing. The burden of distress on contemporary young people only became a phenomenon in recent decades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not terrible for young people to be temporarily poor. As long as the family is harmonious inside and outside, and they work hard to make money after marriage, they can still thrive without &quot;family wealth&quot;. On the contrary, some new families are well off and receive support from their elders, but this also involves many conflicts. Husband and wife quarrel, in-laws are at odds, and there is wastage both internally and externally. Many people only see the benefits of betrothal gifts and dowry, but fail to see that forcibly &quot;fighting&quot; for betrothal gifts is actually a huge disaster for marriage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The family is financially independent and it is difficult for parents to interfere. They didn’t pay, they didn’t pay attention, they couldn’t speak up, and they didn’t have the confidence. If money is given, they must be concerned and have the urge to dominate. Brothers and sisters, as stakeholders, will inevitably speak out. The brother and sister-in-law in the &quot;Red Envelope Incident&quot; are ugly, but they have the right to speak - who told the old man in the family to pay 2,000 yuan as soon as they met, and there will be more later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people understand this truth, but they cannot do it. Under contemporary reality, buying a house requires financial assistance, getting married needs to be organized, and betrothal gifts serve as a start-up fund for a new home and must not be given up. Especially after having children, most couples rely on their parents for help and are far from financially independent. In this case, what should we do? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no better way but to accept reality. Young people who are about to get married are already adults. They cannot ask for money while shouting for independence and rejecting the opinions of their parents. This is inconsistent with interpersonal ethics and goes against human nature. Not only do you want financial benefits, but you also need to be free from restraint. The price must be conflicts in family relationships and weakening of family relationships. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many young people do not realize this and point the source of conflicts at the wrongdoings of their elders. In terms of specific matters, some right and wrong analysis may be possible, but as long as the &quot;investment interests&quot; are not equal, conflicts will inevitably continue. It is unreasonable to enjoy both large transfer payments from parents and to be &quot;independent&quot;. To resolve this conflict, there are only two ways to go: achieve financial independence as soon as possible and compensate your elders for their financial contributions; or accept the reality and compromise with them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of compromise is not a shame, but a price to pay. On the contrary, those who exploit their parents&#39; wealth in the name of independence, take advantage of both sides and ignore their parents&#39; inner pain, are the ones who really deserve to be despised. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 22 Oct 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[14万病例，2年PK，集采仿制药疗效和安全性怎么样？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259061]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-22 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/10/21/a4c26c75fa.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/ 21/a4c26c75fa.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254816&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;For a true and comprehensive understanding of the safety and effectiveness of selected generic drugs in centralized procurement In response to the epidemic, the National Medical Insurance Administration organized medical institutions to conduct real-world research on the clinical efficacy and safety of the second and third batches of generic drugs selected for national mass procurement. Visual China/Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After two years of &quot;big PK&quot;, a study covering 29 medical institutions in 16 provinces across the country and about 140,000 real cases showed that &quot; The clinical efficacy and safety of generic drugs selected through centralized procurement are equivalent to those of original drugs.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since 2018, 8 batches of state-organized drug procurement have been carried out across the country, involving 333 kinds of drugs, with a total use of more than 216 billion tablets/tubes. A large number of selected generic drugs have entered the clinical frontline, reducing the burden on patients and increasing the substitution rate of generic drugs. Hundreds of millions of patients have access to high-quality and affordable drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;There are also some medical staff and patients who still lack confidence in the clinical efficacy and safety of generic drugs, especially whether the quality of the selected generic drugs can be guaranteed after the price reduction. There are concerns, and some people have suggested that consistency evaluation does not equal clinical equivalence.&quot; On the morning of October 17, 2023, Zhang Lan, Director of the Pharmacy Department of Xuanwu Hospital of Capital Medical University (hereinafter referred to as Xuanwu Hospital), spoke at a press conference of the National Medical Insurance Administration Said above. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In order to truly and comprehensively understand the safety and effectiveness of generic drugs selected through centralized procurement, starting from 2021, the National Medical Insurance Administration will organize Xuanwu Hospital and other medical institutions to target the second , conducted real-world research on the clinical efficacy and safety of three batches of generic drugs selected for national mass procurement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Previously, Xuanwu Hospital and more than 20 medical institutions in Beijing conducted real-world research on the 14 selected drugs in the first batch of centralized procurement, and the results showed that the selected drugs There is no statistical difference in clinical effectiveness and safety between generic drugs and original drugs (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For details, please see Southern Weekend&#39;s report on November 7, 2021 &quot;&lt; a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/content/217325&quot;>;100 million people benefited, and the three-year medical insurance negotiation burden was reduced by nearly 170 billion yuan&lt;/a>;》&lt;/span>;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Lan is the leader of the research team for this 140,000 real case study. It is reported that the research and evaluation targets 23 varieties in six major therapeutic areas including anti-infection, anti-tumor, metabolism and endocrinology, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular, neuropsychiatric, and digestive systems, including selected generic drugs from 38 brands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Lan revealed that in the future, we will continue to conduct real-world evaluations of subsequent batches of selected generic drugs to provide evidence-based support for clinical use. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;There is no statistical difference in clinical efficacy and safety&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Real-world research reflects the actual diagnosis and treatment process and changes in patients&#39; health conditions under real conditions. More objectively evaluate the safety and effectiveness of medication in real environments.&quot; Bian Xiaolan, Director of the Pharmacy Department of Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, introduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The results of this study show that five oral anti-infective drugs, including cefdinir, cefaclor, azithromycin, linezolid and moxifloxacin, are similar to There is no statistical difference in clinical efficacy and safety between pharmaceutical and original drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Among the anti-tumor drugs, five generic drugs: Tegio, azacitidine, abiraterone, letrozole, and anastrozole, are comparable to the original drugs The clinical efficacy and safety are equivalent. The therapeutic response rate of generic capecitabine is higher than that of the original drug (50% vs 30%), and the difference is statistically significant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Among the drugs for metabolic diseases, metformin (hypoglycemic drug), vildagliptin (hypoglycemic drug), and febuxostat (uric acid-lowering drug) are the best choices There is no statistical difference in clinical efficacy and safety between generic drugs and original drugs. There are 4 brands of generic drugs of glimepiride (hypoglycemic drugs) participating in the evaluation. Among them, the efficacy and safety of 3 brands of generic drugs are equivalent to the original drugs. Another brand of generic drugs is not only safe. It is equivalent to the original drug, and in the evaluation index of hypoglycemic effect, the compliance rate of glycosylated hemoglobin &lt;7% is higher than that of the original drug (61.7% vs 42%). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A total of 3 types of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular drugs were included in the evaluation, including 2 anticoagulants (apixaban, ticagrelor) and 1 antihypertensive drug medicine (valsartan). The results showed that there was no statistical difference in clinical efficacy and safety between the generic drugs of the above three drugs and the original drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are also 2 psychotropic drugs and 1 digestive system treatment drug. There is no statistical difference in clinical efficacy and safety between the generic drug group and the original drug. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The target population of real-world evaluation is patients who actually use clinical drugs. The sample size can reach hundreds to tens of thousands. The research indicators are direct efficacy and safety. Clinical indicators, study duration, long-term follow-up of subjects as needed. Compared with real-world studies, drug consistency evaluation focuses on verifying the equivalence of generic drugs to original drugs in terms of design, biological absorption and metabolism, and the target population is healthy subjects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Research indicators mainly include pharmaceutical equivalence and bioequivalence. Only when pharmaceutical equivalence and bioequivalence are met can generic drugs Through consistency evaluation.&quot; Bian Xiaolan explained. Pharmaceutical equivalence requires that generic drugs have the same active ingredients, effective dosage, route of administration, dosage form, etc. as the original drug, and must meet drug quality standards. Bioequivalence requires that the absorption and metabolism of generic drug preparations in the body are consistent with those of the original drug. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;We conduct real-world research to further verify and support the efficacy of drugs through different scenarios and methods. It is a process in which real-world data generates real-world evidence. It’s not that the quality and efficacy consistency evaluation work standards are not high.” Bian Xiaolan emphasized that through real-world research, the research team has verified the efficacy and safety of the drugs selected through centralized procurement through the generic drug consistency evaluation from actual diagnosis and treatment scenarios. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Six drugs have been notified of centralized procurement in the past five years&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Passing the consistency evaluation is not a &quot;talisman&quot; or &quot;pass&quot; for drug quality. After a drug passes the consistency evaluation, the regulatory authorities will still conduct full-chain quality supervision on the production, circulation, and use of the drug. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Drug supervision is not only the supervision of results, but also the supervision of the process. For example, the regulatory authorities require: ensure that the production process is consistent with the approved process, and ensure that each batch of sales The quality of sub-standard drugs is consistent with the declared samples to ensure continuous research on marketed drugs and timely reporting of adverse reactions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;For example, in the production process, from the selection of raw materials to the production process, there is a complete quality control and supervision system, even if it is only the supplier of pharmaceutical raw materials. Replacements need to be reported to the drug regulatory department to ensure the stability of drug quality.&quot; Zhang Lan gave an example. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the same time, the national drug administration and medical insurance departments have established a quality supervision coordination mechanism for the selected products, and implemented full-coverage supervision and inspection of the selected companies. The State Food and Drug Administration deploys special supervision work every year to achieve &quot;three full coverages&quot; of enterprise supervision and inspection of selected products through national centralized procurement, product sampling inspection, and adverse drug reaction monitoring. Currently, inspections involve nearly 600 drug manufacturers, covering all 333 selected drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A total of 1,387 selected products were selected in eight batches of national-organized centralized procurement. In the past five years, a total of 6 products have been notified by the drug regulatory authorities as having quality risks, including 2 domestically produced imitation products. Pharmaceuticals, 4 imported drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;For the above-mentioned selected products that have quality risks, the medical insurance department will cooperate with the drug regulatory department to deal with them, including disqualification of the selected products, inclusion in the &#39;violation list&#39;, and restrictions on the products involved. Enterprises must participate in centralized procurement organized by the state within a certain period of time. For products with quality risks, regardless of domestic or foreign-funded enterprises, the medical insurance department will work with the drug regulatory department to deal with them resolutely, treat them equally, and continue to send the signal of &#39;zero tolerance&#39; for quality problems.&quot; National Medical Insurance Zhang Ming, leader of the bureau’s price recruitment expert group, introduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 13, as the Joint Procurement Office of National Organizations Drugs issued an announcement on its official website, the ninth batch of centralized procurement of nationally organized drugs also pressed the start button. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 22 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[浪里人生丨记者手记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259027]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-22 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/11/3KlQURn8IAiq75Cy8HWajQ9l7ECu7pLrtLJOg8Ig.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/3KlQURn8IAiq75Cy8HWajQ9l7ECu7pL rtLJOg8Ig. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253648&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 23, 2023, at Qingdao Olympic Sailing Center, Xu Jingkun sailed a sailboat out to sea&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Liang Chen/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Details of relevant reports See &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/content/258546&quot;>;One-armed captain Xu Jingkun and his super racing boat丨cover character&lt;/a>;&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;October 2023 When Xu Jingkun sailed the boat to the &quot;Coffee Road&quot; racing village on the 14th, I was packing the wardrobe at home. Autumn has entered in the north, and it is said that there will be rain and the temperature will be lower next week. The life of ordinary people is like this, with three meals and four seasons, coming over and over again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This year marks the 30th anniversary of the &quot;Coffee Road&quot; two-man non-stop transatlantic sailing race, and for the first time a single-man return race has been added. Xu Jingkun will first set off from France with his partner, British captain Mike Godin, around the west side of Africa and the northeastern side of South America to reach Central America, and then return to Europe alone. In just over a month, it crossed the equatorial windless zone twice and sailed more than 10,000 nautical miles (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;nearly 20,000 kilometers&lt;/span>;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the video Xu Jingkun posted at sea, it was also very cold in France, and he also put on a thick windproof jacket on the boat. I remembered that during the interview he complained more than once that &quot;the water in France is so cold&quot; and &quot;the water in the Atlantic Ocean is too cold!&quot; I couldn&#39;t help but laugh. The cold and the warm are intertwined, but after all, heroes are very different from us ordinary people. I was busy looking for Wearing a sweater and long trousers, he can overcome the limitations of his body, join the wind and waves, and travel through the seasons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I met him in Qingdao in September, he had just flown back from France the day before. I asked him if he had jet lag, and he said no. &quot;My body is used to it!&quot; Years of ocean sailing have made him accustomed to it. It’s not just the time difference, it’s also the change of seasons. In 2024, he will participate in the world&#39;s most difficult &quot;Vendée Globe&quot; sailing race, and will experience nine winters and summers on the route. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the autumn of 2021, Xu Jingkun decided to buy an imoca60 super racing boat to participate in the 2024 Vendée Single Non-Stop Round the World Yacht Race. The four-year Vendée Globe is the &quot;Everest&quot; of competitive sailing. To win a ticket to the 2024 Vendée Globe, he must first participate in the designated qualifying event. In the 2022 season, he completed the &quot;Rum Road&quot; single-handed transatlantic sailing race, gained valuable points in the Vendée Globe qualifying event, and became one of the first official candidates for the 10th Vendée Globe in 2024. If the &quot;Coffee Road&quot; and the subsequent solo return race can be successfully completed, Xu Jingkun is expected to seize the ticket to the 2024 Vendée Globe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Xu Jingkun was 12 years old, his left forearm was amputated in an accident. He was nicknamed the &quot;one-armed captain&quot;. He controlled the sailboat with one hand and completed the circumnavigation of the China Sea in a single-handed boat. transatlantic, and circumnavigation, among other feats. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2015, Xu Jingkun began to participate in professional boat racing. There is no preferential treatment for the disabled in this field. All participants are &quot;capable&quot; in sailing competition - won the 2020 &quot;Vendée Globe&quot; The seventh-placed captain, Damian Seguin, finished the race wearing a pirate uniform, with a pirate hook in his raised left hand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the first moment I saw Xu Jingkun, his ease and ease made me forget that his residual arm was a problem. He said that sailing has completely changed him and turned him into a more and more comfortable person. I think what really healed him was his &quot;completeness&quot;. He has completely overcome the physical and mental damage caused by the accident. His Although his left hand is incomplete, years of training have given him and inspired him with super physical abilities, allowing him to do his job, control his life, achieve his goals, and walk steadily on the water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It will take Xu Jingkun two days to drive the race boat from the port to the famous French port of Le Havre. Starting from October 20, the &quot;Coffee Road&quot; Double Transatlantic Race Village in Le Havre It will be open to the public, and the boats will set sail on the 29th to begin the 2023 transatlantic racing voyage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Offshore sailing is a magical sport. On the one hand, the racing teams and captains have to withstand the pressure of budget and speed. On the other hand, even the fastest transatlantic record takes seven or eight days. , and the round-the-world voyage lasts for several months. Sailors in the deep sea will always feel a kind of loneliness that lasts for a long time and the sun and the moon are endless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我写这个小文章的时候，徐京坤刚刚发布了一条朋友圈，他还在去勒阿弗尔的路上，他用无人机的鱼眼摄像机拍下自己和赛船，“哈哈，这是我在海上唯一的玩具了！”他的太太阿九给他留言，催他不要贪玩，“你再不到，咖啡路都启航了！”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 22 Oct 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
