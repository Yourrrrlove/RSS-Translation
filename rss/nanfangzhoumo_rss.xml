After being designated by the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, the case was reviewed and prosecuted by the Chenzhou City People&#39;s Procuratorate of Hunan Province. Recently, the Chenzhou City People&#39;s Procuratorate has filed a public prosecution with the Chenzhou City Intermediate People&#39;s Court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the review and prosecution stage, the procuratorial organ informed the defendant Li Chunsheng of his litigation rights in accordance with the law, interrogated the defendant, and listened to the opinions of the defender. Prosecution charges: Li Chunsheng used his position as county magistrate and county party committee secretary of Xin County in Henan Province, deputy director of the Political Department of the Ministry of Public Security and director of the Personnel Training Bureau, deputy governor of Guangdong Province and director of the Provincial Public Security Department, and deputy secretary of the Party Leadership Group of the Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial People&#39;s Congress. , deputy director and other positions, as well as the convenient conditions for the formation of powers and status, to seek benefits for relevant units and individuals in business operations, project promotion, project contracting, job promotion, etc., illegally accepting property from others, the amount is particularly huge, and should be legally accepted He will be held criminally responsible for accepting bribes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 16:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[专访经济学家吴晓求：“要把A股市场从融资市场转变为投资市场”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259197]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-24 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In the Chinese capital market for more than thirty years, with more than 200 million investors and more than 5,300 listed companies, there is no A market that touches the nerves of all parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2023, the Political Bureau meeting of the CPC Central Committee proposed “activating the capital market and boosting investor confidence.” The China Securities Regulatory Commission and other departments subsequently launched a package of policies for “active capital markets”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges are the product of reform. They later underwent two historic reforms: shareholding split and registration system. But for a long time, every investor has suffered from short-term bullishness and bearishness. What loopholes have been left behind by the share-trading reform that once inspired the Long Bull market? How to fix blockage? What loopholes have arisen from the registration system? How to fix it quickly? How can the positioning of China&#39;s capital market mature through changes? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the occasion of the 45th anniversary of the reform and opening up of China&#39;s financial industry, Wu Xiaoqiu, former vice president of Renmin University of China and director of the China Capital Market Research Institute, emphasized in an exclusive interview with Southern Weekend that the establishment of the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges and the split of shares Reform and comprehensive registration-based reform are three monuments in the more than 30 years since the establishment of China&#39;s capital market. While they have achieved great success, they have also left some loopholes. These loopholes are the important institutional constraints that have caused the capital market to stagnate over the past decade. At present, regulatory authorities have realized and stepped up efforts to improve system design and plug loopholes. In the longer term, the main function of China&#39;s capital market is to transform from financing enterprises to a wealth management platform for investors, and from a financing market to an investment market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Xiaoqiu is the youngest professor of economics in the history of Renmin University of China and the first doctoral supervisor in the field of securities investment in China. He has been engaged in securities teaching and research for more than 30 years. He led the compilation of the first edition of China Securities Practitioner examination materials. He is also the promoter and witness of many major reforms in the capital market, such as the share-trading reform and the registration system reform. He has made many suggestions for active capital markets. Among them, his consistent assertion that &quot;the time is not ripe for the implementation of the T+0 trading system&quot; is in line with the China Securities Regulatory Commission. The current stance is consistent. The &quot;Phaseically Tightened Securities Lending and Strategic Investors Placement and Lending of Shares&quot; notice issued by the China Securities Regulatory Commission on October 14, 2023 is also related to the loopholes in the shareholding reduction rules and systems that Wu Xiaoqiu has been paying attention to. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/raTGJwAtxKIRGrHUUoBIlw9OS03pZ4c1M2TYy5Y4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;569&quot; height= &quot;854&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/raTGJwAtxKIRGrHUUoBIlw9OS03pZ4c1M2TYy5Y4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255051&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wu Xiaoqiu: former vice president of Renmin University of China; currently dean of the National Institute of Financial Research and China Capital Market Research Institute of Renmin University of China, national first-class professor, and executive director of the China Society for Finance and Banking . &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Engaged in the economy&lt;/strong>;&lt; strong>;,&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Financial and Capital Market Research&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Forty&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Years”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You are a college student in the &quot;New Third Class&quot; (1977-1979). If the college entrance examination and reform and opening up had not been resumed, how would your life trajectory have evolved? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I never went to high school. Before college, he worked as a carpenter and later as a secretary in the county commerce bureau. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The resumption of the college entrance examination and reform and opening up changed the destiny of my life, just as it changed the destiny of thousands of my contemporaries in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee was held in December 1978, but the college entrance examination was resumed in 1977. Putting the resumption of the college entrance examination before the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, I think this is to prepare for reform and opening up in terms of ideology, talent, and public opinion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The resumption of the college entrance examination is a reform in itself. It is equivalent to a fundamental adjustment of the talent training system during the ten-year &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; period, bringing order to things. Looking back on the past, without reform and opening up, a key move that determines the fate of contemporary China, China would not be what it is today, and neither would I be what I am today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why did you apply for the national economics major of Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I initially applied for the philosophy major at Jiangxi University because I like philosophy. When my father found out, he asked me to change my major. He believes that he should study at Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics. The major in national economic planning is very good and the economy may still be very important in the future. This change is also a &quot;decisive move&quot; for me personally. I later thought about my father&#39;s decision. He foresaw the future development direction of China. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In my first year of college, I got to know Sun Yefang, Yu Guangyuan, Xu Dixin, Song Tao, Dong Fuzhen and other seniors. They are monuments in my mind. The dream of a scholar and the dream of an economist have been with me since I was in college. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the postgraduate entrance examination in 1983, I ranked second overall and was admitted to the National Economic Planning major of Renmin University of China. For the National Economic Planning major, Renmin University is a palace. Later, I studied for a Ph.D. and stayed at the school to teach after graduation, and I never left. I first did economic research for about 10 years. From 1993 to 1994, I officially switched to financial research and capital market research, which now has a history of almost 30 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;If you don&#39;t emancipate your mind, you can&#39;t find the right path to development&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style= &quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;At the beginning of his studies (1983-1986), reform and opening up developed from rural areas to cities, urban economic system reform began, township enterprises began to sprout, and opening up to the outside world continued to expand. During this period, which reform events impressed you the most? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There are four things that impressed me deeply: The first time was attending an economic system reform seminar in Chaohu, Anhui. In 1985, the central government issued the &quot;Decision on Economic System Reform&quot; and launched the economic system reform that combined planning and market. It was a historic decision. I was a second-year graduate student at the time, and my supervisor, Mr. Hu Naowu, and I attended this seminar. That was my first time to participate in a national, high-level forum. It touched me greatly and expanded my horizons. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second time was in 1985, when I participated in the Second Youth and Middle-aged Economic Forum held in Tianjin. The young people participating in the forum were active in thinking, participating in various debates, thinking about China&#39;s future, and exploring the focus of reform. I was writing an article about corporate bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is a thing of the market economy. There was no such thing as bankruptcy in China under the planned economy at that time, only &quot;shut down and transfer&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third time in 1985, I participated in a forum held in the Great Hall of the People. That forum was hosted by Mr. Dong Fucheng, and my speech attracted the attention of Li Chengrui, then director of the National Bureau of Statistics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fourth time was in 1986, when I participated in another discussion meeting on economic leverage in Leshan, Sichuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was only in my twenties at the time. It can be seen that that era gave young people many platforms and opportunities to speak freely at high-level forums held in the Great Hall of the People. This activates your mind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Those were sparkling days, full of youthful dreams and pursuits of young people everywhere. Only when the mind is liberated can academics prosper and the country develop. Without emancipating our minds, we cannot find the right path to development. Everything must be explored, discussed and even debated before you know which is the right path. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Cracking the mystery of China&#39;s special economic phenomenon&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics , Italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;During your doctoral studies (1987-1990), the basic line of &quot;one center, two basic points&quot; and &quot;science and technology are the primary productive forces&quot; were proposed. In the meantime, what are your views on China’s economic reform? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The most important thing when studying for a PhD is to learn advanced theories, study the Chinese economy, and how to solve the mystery of the special phenomena of the Chinese economy at that time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The book that had the greatest impact on me at that time was &quot;The Economics of Shortage&quot; by the Hungarian economist János Korny. In the mid-to-late 1980s, many people read this work. &quot;Shortage Economics&quot; is a book that describes the basic characteristics of socialist economic operations under the traditional planned economic system. It is rich in strong theoretical logic, including soft budget constraints, paternalism, etc. Inspired by his thoughts, I started writing &quot;Theory of Compact Movement&quot; in 1987. &quot;The Theory of Tight Operation&quot; and my doctoral thesis &quot;Analysis of Socialist Economic Operation&quot; were published in 1991 and 1992 respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why did this book receive such special attention at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The real value of these two books is their attempt to explain the characteristics and laws of socialist economic operation under the traditional system. Because of these two books, as well as articles and papers published in People&#39;s Daily, Guangming Daily, Economic Research and Journal of Renmin University of China, I was promoted to professor by Renmin University in 1993. That year, Renmin University made an exception and promoted five professors, and I was the youngest among them. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Transforming securities research and taking a road less traveled&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font -family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In 1994, you were transferred to the Department of Finance and Economics as a professor in the field of securities research in finance. The following year, you became the first doctoral supervisor in the field of securities investment in my country. Since then, you have been closely associated with China&#39;s securities industry. The relationship has been developing for thirty years. Why focus on securities research from now on? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I was already studying finance at that time, so I offered to be transferred. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are two opportunities: one is to alleviate poverty. In the early 1990s, I was about to become a professor and still lived in a Tongzi building with only 800 yuan in savings. At that time, someone gave me an idea, saying that you write a best-selling book, we will be responsible for selling it, and then give you a share. I thought of stocks and bonds. So I edited the &quot;Complete Book of Stocks and Bonds&quot;, which contained about 5 million words in two volumes. It was a great seller as soon as it was launched. Later, I was given some money, and I got out of poverty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because I am the editor-in-chief, people ask me to speak. This forced me to really learn securities knowledge and securities investment. This has begun to deviate from the direction of my economics research, which is entirely the study of capital markets and finance. At that time, people did not think it was a science, and even thought it was a bit &quot;crooked&quot;. An important scholar among my predecessors once talked to me. The core idea was that I should return to the mainstream track of economic research such as economic operation analysis, macroeconomics, macroeconomic management and inflation theory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The path of securities research was a sparsely traveled path at that time. There were few professional researchers, a lot of noise, and very little rational research. But in my opinion, the more in-depth securities research is, the more valuable it is. I am one of the few people left who has done research in the early stages and is still doing front-line research now. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The then president of Renmin University, Mr. Huang Da, was a professor in the Department of Finance, so I applied to go to the Department of Finance. I taught a course on securities investment. At that time, there were not many securities investment courses offered in colleges and universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;I first entered the stock market both for making money and for research&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics , Italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;There was a movie called &quot;Stock Crazy&quot; in 1994, which tells the story of the various crazes caused by mass speculation in the stock market in the early days of the stock market. Was the stock market back then really like in the movies? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>; (The craze for stock trading) has indeed begun. The stock market has begun to enter people&#39;s lives, more and more people are investing in the stock market, and various theories, methods and stock reviews have begun to appear. Because I wrote &quot;The Complete Book of Stocks and Bonds&quot;, I also started doing research on it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;As a research expert on securities investment, what will happen to you? Is stock trading practical? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It was only after 2000 that I really entered the stock market as an investor. After entering, I found that practice was more profoundly helpful to my theoretical research. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What is the difference between securities research and stock trading? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;My goal in entering this market is not only to make money, but also to do research. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I set two goals for myself at that time: first, not to lose money, and to see through practical operations whether what I learned theoretically would work in practice; second, to establish a direct perceptual understanding of the research object. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Slowly, I understand the rules of securities investment and the market better. When I write textbooks, I will be more enriched and my writing will be more vivid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During that period, I presided over the compilation of the first set of teaching materials for the securities practitioner qualification examination in China. The first edition consisted of six volumes. The general structure of the later textbooks compiled by the China Securities Regulatory Commission did not deviate from this edition. It plays a very important role in the qualification examination for securities practitioners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Have the expectations of making money been met? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I also wanted to catch the bull market and make a fortune. The first one I remember was buying Sichuan Changhong, and one day I suddenly discovered that it was going up quite well. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“&lt;strong>;The loopholes left over from the split-share structure reform must be closed &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You once said that China’s capital market has three monuments: Shanghai The establishment of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, the share-trading reform, and the pilot registration system. What have you been involved in promoting? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I participated in the share-trading reform and promoted the pilot registration system. The share-trading reform was launched in May 2005. However, since the theoretical preparation failed in 2001 when the reduction of state-owned shares failed, we began to think about how to carry out share-trading reform. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why did the reduction of state-owned shares fail in 2001? What inspiration did it provide for the subsequent share-trading reform? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;At that time, the regulatory agency believed that the reduction of state-owned shares could be reduced at market price, but it was hastily stopped due to the huge market reaction. Later analysis concluded that reducing state-owned stocks based on market prices lacked both logic and theoretical support, so it was bound to fail. As a result of this failure, we were reflecting on how to promote split-share reform. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During that period of reflection, the academic community organized many discussions, and I was probably one of the people who participated the most, whether in small-scale discussions hosted by the China Securities Regulatory Commission or in large-scale discussions. I participated in almost every discussion. Among them, the most impressive one was when Shang Fulin, then chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, called me one day in 2004 and discussed with me alone how to change the split share structure. Later, I went to his office many times to participate in discussions, with about ten people in a small group and twenty or thirty people in a large group. After discussion, we reached a consensus on two points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first point is that the split share structure reform must be promoted. If we do not promote the reform, China&#39;s capital market will have no future. This is what I also emphasize; the second point is what method should be used to reform the split-share structure reform. The design of this path is very difficult. We slowly considered that consideration reform is appropriate. Consideration reform is only a direction. It becomes more difficult to determine the appropriate consideration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I clearly remember that during a meeting of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, Tu Guangshao, then vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, asked me, what do you think is the appropriate proportion of the consideration? I said 30% or 30% off, because the price of additional issuance of stock is 30% off the circulating price. This provides a reference for the consideration of the share-trading reform. Later, practice proved that the consideration plans for the share-trading reform of various listed companies fluctuated around 30% off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the early days of the share-trading reform in 2005, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets did not Too big a reaction. The big bull market seems to have started only after 2005. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes. The share-trading reform was launched in May 2005. At that time, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets had been in the doldrums for more than four years since 2001, and the market response was lukewarm. Later, the market gradually learned that this thing was serious, and more and more people had a premonition that this was an opportunity for a big bull market. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We judged at that time that the long bear market in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets would be reversed during the share-trading reform process. After the reform is completed, it will lay a good foundation for the long-term healthy development of the capital market. From today&#39;s perspective, the general direction of the share-trading reform is correct. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The share-trading reform took about two years. What shortcomings does it have? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;From May 2005 to March 2007, 95% of listed companies completed the share-trading reform. It is a monument, but it does have flaws. This flaw is the lack of effective constraints on the reduction of major shareholders and actual controllers. This policy loophole had an important impact on the subsequent stagnation of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets for more than ten years. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have also said recently that the most important thing that seriously restricts the development of China’s capital market is the institutional design of the asset supply side. Among them, the asset supply side is mainly the reduction rules of existing assets, which is the actual Controllers and controlling shareholders do not have financial constraints to reduce their holdings, which makes it difficult for the market to grow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How do you think this loophole is being fixed now? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;On August 27, 2023, there have been some amendments in the China Securities Regulatory Commission policy. This is a loophole left by the share-trading reform, and we must make up for it. Because it seriously damages the ecological chain of capital supply and demand in the capital market and causes a serious imbalance in the capital supply relationship. At present, major loopholes are being patched, so at least we know where they are. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Registration reform has had mixed effects”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt; span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The third monument you mentioned in China’s capital market is the registration-based reform. Why start the registration system reform? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After 2007, the theoretical research, or policy formulation, that I participated in was mainly the registration system reform. Why should we carry out registration reform? Because the approval system has major flaws. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the biggest problem with the approval system is that the choice of listing a company is not left to the market, but to the Issuance Review Committee and to visible hands. The second problem is that the pricing is not market-oriented, so there is a strange phenomenon of 20 daily limit after listing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third problem is that the regulatory body and the auditing body are not separated. The China Securities Regulatory Commission both audits and supervises. This is of course problematic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the fact that the approval system has at least these three problems, if we want to correct these three defects, we must carry out the registration system reform. In accordance with the principle of marketization, the exchange adopts a flexible system, and at the same time does not adhere to the requirement that companies to be listed must be profitable. Compared with the approval system, which requires companies to be listed to be profitable for three consecutive years, one of the biggest innovations of the registration system is that major high-tech companies that are planning to be listed are allowed to have losses in the past three years, but they must have sustainable operating capabilities. This is a major change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;2023 is the first year of the comprehensive registration system reform. As a promoter and policy participant of the registration system reform, are you satisfied with the current results of the reform? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Bittersweet. Fortunately, some unicorn companies and high-tech companies have become listed companies through this mechanism. Although they are losing money in the short term, they have the ability to operate sustainably. The registration system reform naturally serves specialized and high-tech innovative enterprises, and is naturally coupled with high-tech enterprises. Only under the registration system can technology and capital markets be coupled, and we will still work in this direction in the future. I think this is of great value and significance to us in promoting the development of high-tech enterprises, transforming my country&#39;s industrial structure and upgrading and iterating industries, improving the structure of listed companies, and enhancing the investment value of China&#39;s capital market. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is worrying is the generalization of the definition of loss in the registration system. This is a serious misunderstanding, which damages market confidence and is not in line with the original meaning of the registration system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why does this vulnerability occur? What are the dangers of this vulnerability? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Like the share-trading reform, the registration-based reform also has a loophole. Frankly, no one realized it at the time. Just like designing a spacecraft, there are a lot of details and a lot of sparse details. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The loophole of the registration system is that it generalizes the market-oriented functions, or it generalizes the indicators that listed companies do not strictly require profitability. So later, some listed companies seized on such a loophole and established a so-called high-tech enterprise. Under the banner of the so-called &quot;breaking the bottleneck project&quot;, they hired dozens of researchers and started to apply for IPO after two or three years. . This has done huge damage to market confidence. They do not comply with the basic spirit of the registration system, and also exceed the requirements of the risk boundaries that a public market, exchange market, and public investors can bear. The financing of this type of enterprise should mainly be completed by PE and VC, and direct IPO is not allowed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I define this loophole as: a generalized understanding of the non-profit requirement under the registration system. This is a very serious misunderstanding, which is closely related to the subsequent stagnation of the stock market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Is this vulnerability currently being patched? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I once made it clear to the China Securities Regulatory Commission that the requirement that companies to be listed be unprofitable cannot be generalized. Judging from the recent IPO situation, the China Securities Regulatory Commission and exchanges have also paid special attention to the listing requirements of companies with negative financial indicators, especially those with negative net assets, negative cash flow, and negative profits. These major financial reporting indicators are all negative, and such companies cannot be listed. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After fixing the loopholes, the registration system reform is completed What? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Far from it. The registration-based reform is an all-round, whole-chain reform. The market-oriented reform of the issuance system is only its historical and logical starting point. It will also be followed by transactions, mergers and acquisitions, information disclosure, supervision, delisting, penalties for violations and illegal acts, legal models, etc. Adjustments in many other aspects must be incorporated into the model compatible with the registration system reform and continuously improved. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;&lt;strong>;Twin Peaks model is the ideal compromise&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong >;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In 2022, you proposed the &quot;twin peaks model&quot; of China&#39;s financial system. What are the deep observations and thoughts behind it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Frankly speaking, the first thing I proposed was the &quot;single bee mode&quot;. Around 2002, I believed that China’s future financial model would be dominated by the capital market. Twenty years have passed, and I have found that the &quot;single bee model&quot; is very difficult to achieve in China. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despite this, in the past 20 years, the scale of China&#39;s capital market has expanded relatively rapidly. From a market capitalization of two to three trillion in the past to a market capitalization of more than eighty trillion today, its proportion in the financial system has increased significantly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, I finally realized that China’s commercial banks play a huge role in China’s economic life, and China can only implement the bimodal model-the banking system and the capital market jointly dominate. This is an ideal compromise and a realistic situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why is it difficult for the capital market to become dominant? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The development of the capital market has not changed the dependence of the Chinese economy on currency and credit. From the perspective of the capital market itself, the stock prices of listed companies have not increased in the past 20 years, and the market index has not increased. Only the market value has expanded. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the number of listed companies has increased from 1,000 to more than 5,300 in the past 20 years. Almost China’s largest and best companies have achieved IPOs, including many state-owned enterprises and central enterprises. and “unicorn” companies. In a sense, the function of China&#39;s stock market in facilitating enterprise financing has been realized, but it itself is a pie-spreading expansion, constantly expanding outwards without intensive cultivation, and the unit output rate of enterprises after obtaining financing is very low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why is our index not growing? A very important reason is to go back to the two loopholes I just mentioned, especially the first loophole, which is the reduction rule, which has a huge inhibitory effect on growth. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;China’s stock market&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Why&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;is still immature&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong >;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Our capital market has developed for more than 30 years. At the age of thirty, can it be considered a mature market? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;China’s capital market has slowly found a basic direction in practice and reform, but it is still an immature market. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first immaturity is that there are many loopholes in the system design. The second immaturity lies in the lack of a deep understanding of what the capital market means to China and what it means to financial reform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, we often said that the main purpose of establishing the stock market was to facilitate corporate financing. This is an incorrect positioning and perception. The securities market appears to be financing, but is actually investment. If you don’t continuously strengthen your investment function, financing will be unsustainable, and people will vote with their feet. If you leave, how can you raise funds? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, we need to transform China’s capital market from a financing market that facilitates corporate financing to a wealth management platform and investment market for investors. Transforming from a financing market to an investment market is our future direction. It will take a long time to achieve this goal. For institutional effects to take effect, it will take time for corresponding institutional arrangements to be put in place. Our current institutional arrangements are closing loopholes and moving closer to this aspect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;A-shares are bullish and bearish. The main problem is the loopholes in the system design and Don’t really understand the significance of the capital market to financial reform? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The reason for this phenomenon in China’s capital market is not only the profound cultural and legal background, but also the misalignment of rules at the meso level. For example, there are two loopholes in the share-trading reform and the registration-based reform mentioned earlier. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, part of the reason is that our entrepreneurs do not have a deep understanding of what going public means to them. Originally, going public was a means, but these company founders suddenly discovered that it was so easy to make a fortune by going public, which was much easier than working hard in the real economy. This corroded their original intention to start a business in the past. He will take listing as his goal and stop doing the real economy. He will find a way to cash out and leave as soon as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To correct this misdirection, we can only guide it through institutional reform - only by doing a good job can you cash out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What specific suggestions do you have for this? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;To achieve a fundamental transformation of the functions and orientation of the capital market, the first step is to transform the overall macro-system design. On the asset supply side, the system design must be conducive to the transformation of market functions, the introduction of transparent and growth-producing assets into the market, and the attraction of more and more new investors and the entry of new funds into the market. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, we should have certain restrictions on all pre-listing shareholders reducing their shareholdings, especially controlling shareholders and actual controllers, including second shareholders, third shareholders, etc. How to use Financial indicators constrain shareholding reductions and require innovative system designs to allow all shareholders to focus their attention and efforts on how to do a good job in the company, create profits, and improve distribution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, we must continue to improve the ecological environment of the capital market. Whether institutional investors or individual investors, in this market, they can obtain returns commensurate with their risks, and only then will the market grow. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;&lt;strong>;The stock market continues to not improve, and we need to come up with the right response&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;At the end of July, the central government clearly proposed to &quot;activate the capital market.&quot; What signal does this send? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It should be said that the supervisory authorities have seen the problem. No field in China covers such a large scope as the capital market. There are at least 200 million investors in the capital market, and behind them may be 200 million families. Almost half of the people in China have something to do with the capital market. Second, although the global capital markets have gone through the epidemic, China&#39;s capital markets among major economies have not performed well. We need to pay more attention to the problems behind it. Third, activating the capital market is also an important measure to boost market confidence. We need to come up with the right response. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;There are also many expert suggestions for activating the capital market A shares switch from T+1 to T+0. But regulators have long said the opportunity is premature. What do you think? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The transaction reform has no substantive significance, T+0 is not conducive to the growth of the market, and the logical basis of the T+0 reform is unclear. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, the biggest benefit of T+0 is to securities companies. T+0 will directly lead to an increase in brokerage commissions, thereby driving the rise of brokerage stocks. The goal of our reform is not to make securities companies prosperous, and the original intention of activating the capital market is not to increase commissions. An increase in commissions will instead mean the leakage of capital market funds. As for what some people say that T+0 has a correction mechanism for market prices, I think more empirical research is needed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, the trading rules based on T+1 were chosen in the early days of the birth of China’s capital market and against the background of many trials and errors of trading rules. After more than 30 years of practice, they have become very mature and more Suitable for China&#39;s national conditions. I like the T+1 system very much. Why do stocks bought in the morning have to be sold in the afternoon? Since you are going to sell in the afternoon, don’t buy in the morning. The logic is very clear. If you buy it wrong, it will be the same if you sell it tomorrow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirdly, the T+1 system is not unique to China and is also very mature internationally.不见得有些国家用T+0，我们也用。从我个人来说，不太喜欢T+0，因为这个制度会把人们搞得癫狂。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末：你对中国股市有信心吗？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;吴晓求:中国股市好起来的前提是中国经济要好起来。我一直说中国经济只要想搞好，是一定能搞好的。从本质上说，中国经济基础是好的。只要发挥市场的主导作用，适应历史的趋势，遵守市场规律，尊重企业和企业家精神，推动改革开放，走市场经济之路，中国经济就一定能搞好，怎么可能搞不好？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当下中国经济的问题，主要不是周期性因素带来的。我一直坚信，只要把过去45年改革开放中被证明是成功的经验坚持下去，进一步完善，中国经济就能继续保持良好趋势，中国资本市场也就有了成长基础。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[公安部：已缉捕电信网络诈骗集团重大头目和骨干387名]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259195]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-24 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In the morning of the 24th, the State Council Information Office held a series of press conferences on the theme of &quot;Authority Departments Start Talking&quot; According to the relevant person in charge of the Ministry of Public Security, since August this year, the number of telecom network fraud cases nationwide and the number of property losses caused have dropped by 24% and 20.5% respectively year-on-year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In accordance with the unified deployment of the Ministry of Public Security, local public security agencies have continued to strengthen their crackdowns and carried out in-depth special operations such as &quot;Cloud Sword&quot;, &quot;Card Break&quot;, &quot;Cut Off&quot; and &quot;Pull Out the Nail&quot;.

When they went to the hotel and took apart the chandelier, they found that the camera was still there, which shocked them. People are extremely frightened when they think about it carefully. If someone is secretly photographed while staying in a hotel, what responsibility should the hotel bear? Hidden photography has been banned for many times. How can we eradicate the industrial chain behind it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a recent report from Guangxi TV, Mr. Hu from Nanning recently received an intimate video of himself and his fiancée staying in a hotel a year ago. When he arrived at the hotel, he discovered that the two cameras hidden in the chandelier were still there. The hotel manager said that they were also victims. There was no abnormality in other rooms after checking, and they only wanted to refund the room fee. The report attracted a lot of attention online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;News about being secretly photographed while staying in a hotel appears frequently. Searching for &quot;hotel sneak shots&quot; on a certain search engine can yield tens of millions of related information. Recent news, in addition to the above mentioned, also appeared in Lianyungang, Jiangsu, Loudi, Hunan and other places. A few years ago, the person in charge of a hotel in Zhengzhou, Henan Province even claimed that 80% of hotels had secret cameras. In fact, hidden cameras are not only found in hotels, but also in fitting rooms of clothing stores, toilets in office buildings, and even in the toilets of high-speed trains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These hidden cameras seriously violate the privacy of others and are undoubtedly illegal and criminal acts. If a hotel installs a camera without permission, the hotel will certainly be held responsible. But if someone else secretly installed it without the hotel’s knowledge, does the hotel need to take responsibility? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are indeed many such situations. According to industry insiders, bad guys can pretend to be guests staying in hotels, install cameras in just ten minutes at a time, and then change rooms for various reasons, and can secretly install several rooms at a time. In the case of a camera being discovered in a Lianyungang hotel, the suspect captured by the police was an unemployed person, not a hotel employee. In a guiding case released by the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate in 2022, criminals also secretly installed cameras in the rooms of many hotels to take photos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, is it true that, as the manager of the hotel in Nanning claimed, they are also victims and do not need to bear responsibility for the infringement of their guests? Of course not. When travelers check into a hotel, they certainly regard the hotel room as a private place and have reasonable expectations for their privacy in the room. The hotel should fulfill its reasonable obligations to protect the privacy of guests. Guests were secretly photographed and their privacy was invaded, which is inseparable from the hotel&#39;s failure to fulfill its safety and security obligations. As for this hotel in Nanning, the camera is still there more than a year later, which shows how neglected management it is. If a candid camera incident occurs, the hotel will not only have to close down for rectification, but also compensate the guests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The hotel has an obligation to protect the privacy of its guests. In fact, there are now portable detection instruments specifically for pinhole cameras on the market. As long as the hotel equips cleaning or security personnel with a set, most hidden cameras can be detected in a short time. The cost of doing this is not high. The key is that anti-candid photography should become a standard in the hotel industry and something every hotel must do, just like cleaning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why candid photography in hotels is frequently banned is because there is a black industrial chain behind it. Criminals do not secretly shoot videos for excitement, but put these secretly shot videos on the dark web and other illegal websites for sale. Some websites and social accounts use the banner of &quot;hotel secret photography&quot; to attract users to pay to watch private videos. The entire black industry of candid photography may be worth hundreds of billions of dollars every year. In the aforementioned guidance case issued by the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, criminals used illegal websites, instant messaging software, etc. to publish information and sell secretly filmed private videos. In 2021, Liaoning police also eliminated a black industry chain that used hidden cameras to secretly photograph and live broadcast in hotels for profit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to selling on the dark web, some people also use the private videos captured to extort money. At the end of 2022, after a woman in Loudi, Hunan was secretly filmed in a hotel, someone sent the video to her and extorted money. This time Mr. Hu from Nanning, Guangxi received a secretly filmed video. The other person probably did not remind him that he was secretly filmed, and it was also very possible that he was trying to blackmail him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We must intensify our crackdown on secret photography. Now that all communication accounts implement real-name systems, it shouldn&#39;t be too difficult for the police to find criminals. For those who send messages for extortion, the police can find the blackmailer through the account that sent the message, and then follow the clues to find out how the blackmailer obtained the video, as well as the customer&#39;s contact information and other private information, and eliminate the entire chain. At the same time, they can Find out whether the hotel has any issues with leaking guest privacy. After all, even if criminals secretly install cameras, it would be difficult to know the guests&#39; contact information without a hotel insider, and there would be no way to extort money. Only the secret camera was found, and the police also have the means to find the installer. The police quickly caught the suspect using the cameras of Lianyungang Hotel and the women&#39;s restroom of an office building in Tianjin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the face of rampant candid photography, on the one hand, the police must intensify their crackdown on the black industrial chain. Management of secret photography and recording equipment must also be strengthened. Nowadays, various miniature hidden cameras can be purchased everywhere on the Internet, as well as various teaching videos on camera cracking and vulnerability exploitation, which have contributed to the proliferation of candid photography. The hotel industry should also formulate standards and incorporate anti-peeping cameras into the daily management of the industry to protect the privacy and security of guests as much as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“毛孩子”上幼儿园]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258991]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-24 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/V0LTOkR67vJedXXZb5clBZd8L6rjNgVAPLvRo1Tt.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/V0LTOkR67vJedXXZb5clBZd8L6rjNgVA PLvRo1Tt. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254465&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Two &quot;students&quot; participated in the agility game course in kindergarten&lt;span style=&quot;color : #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Liang Chen/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On an autumn afternoon, three pet dogs of different types participated in games under the guidance of their dog trainers.

It was reported on the Internet that a residential property management team had set up a &quot;dog fighting team&quot;, and security guards patrolled with sticks and nets; Bozhou in Anhui, Zhengzhou in Henan, Taixing in Jiangsu, Urban management departments in Qingdao, Shandong and other places have successively released videos of catching stray dogs, and netizens have begun heated discussions about whether stray dogs should be culled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Controversial cases also emerged. A stray dog ​​living in Chongqing University of International Business and Economics was driven to death by security guards. On October 20, the school reported that a student was chased by a stray dog ​​on his way back to bed. The school security guard had engaged in inappropriate behavior during the chase and the security guard involved had been suspended. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found that after this incident, many places carried out special rectifications on the behavior of ownerless dogs, aggressive dogs, and not wearing leashes. But at the same time, various rumors are also circulating on online platforms. In fact, in many places, catching stray dogs is a regular task. The captured stray dogs will be sent to stray animal rescue centers for shelter and will not be killed. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;What responsibilities should the property owner bear?&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After the Rottweiler dog biting incident, slogans were hung in many places in the Xichen Oasis Community of Hengda where the girl lived: &quot;Walking dogs in a civilized manner and keeping the leash on them&quot; &quot;, keep your mouth shut and don&#39;t hurt others&quot; &quot;Tighten the &#39;civilized rope&#39; and be a civilized dog owner&quot;...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 20, a mother who lived above the victim girl told a Southern Weekend reporter , the day the girl was bitten, the angry owners were already discussing in the owner group: &quot;If such a big thing happened, where is the security guard?&quot; &quot;Why don&#39;t they know when an outside dog comes in?&quot; Under pressure, the property began patrolling daily to catch off-leash dogs. These tasks will be posted to the group one by one and reported to the owner, with arrest videos and photos attached. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This tense atmosphere quickly spread to other communities. On October 17, the media reported that a &quot;dog fighting team&quot; was set up in Fuhe Yujing Community in Chengdu City. In the video, security guards were patrolling with sticks and nets. The property staff said: &quot;All stray dogs are left unattended and without leashes.&quot; Yes, the whole community needs to be rectified.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon of October 18, the Sanduhui Chaowai Community in Chengdu hung a banner in the name of the property saying &quot;The community will hunt and kill unleashed cats and dogs.&quot; The word &quot;hunt and kill&quot; immediately caused worries and accusations from pet owners in the community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Li Ming, a resident of the community, the idea of ​​&quot;hunting and killing&quot; actually came from the community&#39;s mother group. Out of concern, the mothers suggested in the group &quot;methods to deal with stray dogs: first, kill or capture them as much as possible, second, drive them out of the community and then call the police to notify the community.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, those who opposed the culling called the government service hotline 12345 to complain one after another on the evening of the 18th. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next morning, the property management company stated that the banner was inappropriate and had been removed. &quot;The property management company no longer dares to answer the phone. The street refused to allow them to kill the people by force and warned them in the morning.&quot; Li Ming said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters called the property and street office of the community many times, but none of them got through. On the 20th, the Property Affairs Service Center of the Chengdu Municipal Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau responded to the media saying that the center had not received a notice that a dog hunting team was set up in a community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chang Sha, a lawyer at Beijing Jingdu Law Firm, has been involved in cases of dog injuries.

In non-emergency situations, property management can only be handled by persuasion or handed over to urban management and public security agencies with law enforcement powers. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Remediation in many places, rumors go hand in hand&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the evening of the 18th, when the owners of a Chengdu community were arguing about whether to cull stray dogs, the urban management department of Jinshui District, Zhengzhou City, Henan Province targeted dogs without leashes.

In this live broadcast in Zhengzhou, a young man holding a French bulldog was chased for a long distance. According to the live video, although the urban management personnel repeatedly emphasized that they would not harm the dog and would only take it back for registration and investigation, the young man tried to escape with the black dog after some unsuccessful negotiations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This video has become another spreading point of this Internet storm. Xiao Zhen, a citizen who also raises French bulldogs in Zhengzhou, told Southern Weekend reporters that it is indeed prohibited to raise French bulldogs in Zhengzhou. Dog licenses are usually not allowed, but the law enforcement is not strict and &quot;we would check occasionally in the past.&quot; At the same time, many cities across the country allow the breeding of French bulldogs, including Beijing, Shanghai, Xi&#39;an, Dalian, Harbin, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Changsha, etc. After learning that the young man needed to pay a fine of 5,000 yuan, the group of French bullfighting enthusiasts sent him red envelopes one after another, saying that they would help him get his dog back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Du Fan, president of the Wuhan Small Animal Protection Association, said that the current management of dogs in cities is mainly based on regulations formulated by each locality. Such administrative regulations are not very effective, so many people do not apply for dog licenses. Nor do they keep dogs according to regulations. (For details, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/content/258846&quot;>;&quot;Many experts talk about the Rottweiler dog biting a girl: &quot;The key is to manage people, followed by managing dogs&quot;&quot;&lt;/ a>;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the division of powers for dog management in cities is not clear. Most cities are currently in charge of public security, and some are under the charge of urban management. Dog management also involves industry and commerce, food safety, and public security. Management and other departments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident of Rottweiler dogs injuring children, many places issued special management actions. Bozhou in Anhui, Taixing in Jiangsu, Shenqiu in Henan, Shehong in Sichuan and other places targeted ownerless dogs, aggressive dogs, and unprotected dogs. The behavior of pulling ropes will be specially rectified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In it, rumors and facts are mixed. Southern Weekend reporters found that in videos calling for not killing stray dogs, photos of dozens of dog corpses and scenes of being thrown to death often appear, but there is no time stamp. Just looking at the background of the picture, buses and buildings should be numbers. years ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the hot topic on Weibo &quot;Puppies don&#39;t feel like they are wandering&quot;, many netizens identified a photo of a puppy that was still grinning after being arrested as the one involved in the Chongqing University of International Business and Economics. It was a yellow dog, with the caption &quot;It was still laughing when it was caught, it thought it was going to have a home&quot;, and expressed condolences. However, the author of the original picture refuted the rumors and said that the smiling puppy was taken in April and is not the same dog as the one in Chongqing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It’s a bit out of focus.” Zhou Wei, director of the Jiangsu Provincial Zoological Society, found that as the situation developed, netizens’ discussions gradually turned into opposing issues such as loving dogs or not, and culling or not culling. , without going into details. For example, many video titles say &quot;catching&quot; stray dogs, but most of the current videos only show &quot;catching&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Normalization of Urban Management&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found through searches that many dog-catching videos were released by the official accounts of urban management and public security agencies in various places, such as Qingdao West Coast New District Comprehensive Administrative Law Enforcement Bureau. It released three videos in a row, introducing that catching stray dogs is a regular task. The captured stray dogs will be sent to the stray animal rescue center for shelter and will not be killed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The distribution of dog leashes and dog muzzles has attracted attention. The Comprehensive Administrative Law Enforcement Bureau of Shehong City, Sichuan Province, which is considered by netizens to be a model of civilized law enforcement, told Southern Weekend reporters that they will set up dog leashes starting in 2021. The management office is equipped with professional dog-catching equipment and vehicles, and has 5 staff members daily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Saihan District, Hohhot City, according to the City Comprehensive Law Enforcement Bureau, the bureau took over the work of catching stray dogs in 2020. In 2023 alone, it received more than 1,100 related reports and has captured stray dogs. There are more than 300 dogs, and most of the reports are about barking dogs disturbing people, especially in the early morning and early morning. Zhang Yong, head of the bureau&#39;s publicity department, said that when team members receive a reporting call, they must contact the person involved in a timely manner and respond to the person after handling the case. If they cannot catch the person, the team members will have to go there at least three times within a week. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This doesn&#39;t sound like an easy job. Zhang Yong said that they have specially formulated a long-term mechanism for this purpose, which is divided into day shift and night shift. &quot;There are 38 people in the mobile squadron participating in dog hunting.&quot; They have to patrol the 1,025 square kilometers under the jurisdiction of Saihan District. When the dog climbs over the fence and enters the bush, it is difficult for law enforcement officers to catch up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More importantly, stray dogs have a keen sense of smell. As soon as the law enforcement vehicles that carry stray dogs all the year round stop in a place, &quot;no dogs will come out of this area.&quot; Zhang Yong said that one of their team members saw a stray dog ​​while driving around in his car and called for a law enforcement vehicle. Before the vehicle arrived, the stray dog ​​started to get restless. &quot;It could smell the smell of the car.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every dog-catching team member in Saihan District has been bitten by a dog, and some have broken their legs while catching dogs. The tool they use is a fishing net. Dogs of different sizes use different types of fishing nets. The largest ones use fiber rope nets as thick as their thumbs. &quot;They have very good teeth and can bite through thin ropes in one bite.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sichuan Province Shehong City Comprehensive Administrative Law Enforcement Bureau and Qingdao West Coast New District Comprehensive Law Enforcement Administration both responded to Southern Weekend reporters that the tools used to catch dogs are mainly fishing nets. In most of the dog-catching videos circulated on the Internet, law enforcement officers used fishing nets. Only one video showed a dog-catching video with a license plate number from Taizhou, Zhejiang, using curved clamps. Zhou Wei believes that the fishing net is currently a more suitable tool for catching dogs. It has a soft texture and can trap dogs without causing too much harm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Yong said that after the stray dogs are caught, they will be sent to the detention center managed by the public security department for adoption. After the dog is inspected, the detention center will give the urban management team member a receipt, which will clearly indicate the receipt. Quantity and condition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A reporter from Southern Weekend called the Hohhot Public Security Bureau Dog Inspection Station, and the other party replied that the institute has 50 acres of kennels and is currently able to raise stray cats and dogs until they die of natural causes. In addition, the center is open to the public for adoption, and you can visit, adopt or donate materials during the open day. As for the number of stray cats and dogs currently detained in the inspection center, the staff member said that detailed data could not be provided for the time being. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Bodhi Nursing Home for Stray Fur Children in Shehong, Sichuan is a privately run base for stray cats and dogs. It occupies a hilltop in the mountains and feeds stray cats and dogs in different areas. In 2021, the base began to receive stray cats and dogs caught by the urban management department, 20-30 every year. &quot;They are sent here sporadically, and they are all caught after being complained about disturbing the residents.&quot; Ms. Ren, the person in charge of the base, said that the urban management department Part of the cost of dog food is provided. Cats and dogs will be checked for infectious diseases in advance before delivery. If there are injuries or illnesses, they will go to the pet hospital for treatment first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ms. Ren said that Shehong has launched a special operation to capture stray cats and dogs since October 20, and 11 stray dogs were delivered in just one day. She was a little worried that too many cats and dogs would be sent in a short period of time and that the base would not be able to handle the load. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;More sophisticated, professional and scientific&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On October 20, the French Dou who was captured in Zhengzhou has been brought back to his hometown for adoption , and the Zhengzhou Urban Management Bureau told the media that the case is still going through the process and the fine has not yet been determined. The topic of why French bulldogs are banned has been hotly discussed in the dog breeding circle. Mao Jing, who has raised French bulldogs for many years, saw from this the management problems of dog breeding in the city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mao Jing said that French bulldogs are not clearly marked on Shanghai’s prohibited list, but French bulldogs have long been regarded as a type of bulldog and face different management methods in various districts of Shanghai. In 2014, she raised her first French bulldog, and she successfully applied for a dog license in Siping Street, Yangpu District. In 2016, Mao Jing was planning to raise a second French bulldog, but when she applied for a dog license in Jiangpu Street, the same district, her dog license was rejected. It was approved after a phone appeal. &quot;The handler didn&#39;t know much about this dog breed.&quot; In 2019, Shanghai stated that legal fighting is allowed in the city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the French Bulldog incident in Zhengzhou, she specially compared the lists of banned dogs in Zhengzhou and Shanghai, and found that Shanghai clearly prohibited the breeding of British bulldogs, but French Bulldogs were not allowed; while Zhengzhou clearly prohibited the breeding of French Bulldogs, But I can&#39;t help but raise heroes to fight. Mao Jing said that the two types of dogs have different body shapes and agility. In comparison, Yingdou can grow to 60-80 pounds. &quot;Even if it doesn&#39;t bite, hitting someone may be more serious.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There is actually no common standard for dog breeds in our country.” Zhou Wei said that when foreign dog breeds were introduced in the early stages, there may be a lack of understanding of the dog breed’s habits or translation problems. &quot;This reflects management lag.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China&#39;s pet industry has developed by leaps and bounds in more than ten years, and the problem of how people and animals coexist in cities has continued to become prominent. The &quot;2021 China Pet Industry White Paper&quot; shows that the total number of pet dogs and pet cats in cities and towns nationwide in 2021 will exceed 112 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhou Wei believes that in terms of dog management, a more refined, professional and scientific management mechanism is needed starting from the source. For example, when breeding, attention should be paid to the breed genes and how to train them. The problem is that there is currently a lack of supervision in the upstream breeding stage, and it is only at the pet raising stage that it starts to get tight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Du Fan also holds a similar view. He believes that many incidents of dog injuries can be traced back to the source: &quot;Why are banned violent dogs still sold on the market?&quot; From this, he suggested that dogs are born from Establish a series of supervision mechanisms for sales and breeding, and clarify departmental responsibilities and management rights and responsibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhou Wei suggested that solving the current problem can start with popular science education, such as providing professional training services to campuses and real estate properties: how to deal with ferocious dogs in the community, how to correctly place and capture them; People provide training: how to scientifically understand and control their pet dogs, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Wuhan Small Animal Association, where Du Fan works, has reached a cooperation with the local public security department. Around the 25th of each month, some captured stray dogs from the inspection center are open to the public for adoption, calling for &quot;adopting instead of purchasing&quot; &quot;. Du Fan said that the previous two adoption events were successfully held, and all the dogs kept for inspection were successfully adopted. &quot;We are currently preparing for the third one.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ Southern Weekend reporter Gao Yichen also contributed to this article (Li Ming and Mao Jing are pseudonyms in the article)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中美经济工作组举行第一次会议]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259175]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-24 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;According to He Lifeng, Vice Premier of the State Council and Chinese leader of China-US Economic and Trade, and Janet.

It is worth noting that on September 29, the Ministry of Education responded to a netizen’s question about “Whether the first degree after graduation is a junior college or a bachelor’s degree?” The concept of “first degree” is not used in the relevant policies and documents of the national education administration department regarding the learning experience of scientific and cultural education and skills training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, from an objective point of view, graduates with master&#39;s and doctoral degrees from prestigious schools generally have some advantages in the job market. Needless to say, this may be &quot;first degree discrimination&quot; The realistic background in which relevant issues have received attention. But is similar recruitment behavior “merit-based” or “discriminatory”? It may not be possible to generalize, but the issues of corporate operational autonomy and employment autonomy that run through it are also important aspects worthy of analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, for graduate students from 985 universities, does the recruiting unit or human resources specialist make a clear employment choice based on the prerequisite of &quot;undergraduate degree from a prestigious school&quot;? This is actually hard to say. Especially as a for-profit organization, the company will ultimately look at whether the applicant&#39;s abilities and talents match the company&#39;s employment needs. It may also be that the company&#39;s interviewer confirms the match between the applicant&#39;s abilities and the company&#39;s needs through a comprehensive, complete and systematic assessment. . And graduates with master&#39;s and doctoral degrees who have been blessed by famous schools may have shown certain advantages in this link and finally got the opportunity, but it may not necessarily be simple and crude academic qualifications that win. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Generally speaking, the recruitment process of the employer is that the human resources specialist will screen the resume before the interview. Only after passing the preliminary screening will he be qualified to participate in the initial interview hosted by the human resources department and even the professional interview hosted by the leader of the hiring department. interview. If some companies clearly stipulate in black and white that they will not recruit students with &quot;double bachelor&#39;s degrees&quot; or are suspected of academic discrimination, if master&#39;s and doctoral graduates with &quot;double bachelor&#39;s degrees&quot; can pass the resume screening, in this sense, 985 As a stepping stone, colleges and universities have already been used in the preliminary screening stage. The stepping stone is just a stepping stone. Next, it depends on whether the job seeker has real ability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, it should be noted that there is no need for society to over-amplify the halo blessing of the so-called &quot;first degree&quot;. Today, there are so many students graduating from 985 with undergraduate degrees. In the face of the severe employment situation, some Ph.D.s from Peking University have gone to compete for urban management personnel, and some have Ph.D.s from Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine to work as school doctors in middle schools. Undergraduate program 985 really does not have as dazzling aura and powerful blessing as some people imagine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, objectively speaking, students from undergraduate 985 colleges generally have some advantages in the job market compared to non-985 colleges. This itself also has a reasonable side. If this advantage does not exist, then the motivation for students to work hard to get into a good university may not exist, and there will be no difference between a good university and an average university. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, on the surface, students have gained some advantages with the blessing of diplomas from 985 colleges, but the actual logic is the other way around: the ranking of college entrance examination scores and the distinction between prestigious schools and non-prestigious schools are Ranking of students’ intelligence and abilities. In this sense, it is generally the outstanding students who make the 985 colleges and universities successful, not the other way around. Therefore, the 985 diploma has an important signaling function and constitutes an important reference for employers to screen resumes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, there are people with high scores and low abilities, and there are also people with low scores and high abilities; there are people who make mistakes in the college entrance examination, and there are also people who perform exceptionally well in the college entrance examination. However, firstly, it depends on whether it is a high probability or a small probability; secondly, In the end, everyone has to accept the test of the market and the employer. It depends on the real talent and hard work, whether it is a mule or a horse drawn out for a walk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Enterprises are profit-making organizations, and they will ultimately look at whether the candidates’ abilities and talents match the company’s employment needs, and whether they can create higher value for the company. The HR and employing departments may take a high look at job seekers with 985 undergraduate degrees, but that’s all. Next, it depends on whether the job seekers’ performance in the interview meets their expectations for talents. Especially in free competition industries, companies have no incentive to leave more capable non-985 undergraduate job seekers and instead use incompetent 985 undergraduate job seekers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If there are two people, one has a non-985 degree + 985 graduate school, and the other has a 985 degree + 985 graduate school, and the company does not admit the former but admits the latter, does it become &quot;first degree discrimination&quot;? I&#39;m afraid not so. Job seekers and employers are two-way choices. Reaching a consensus respects the rights of both parties and improves market efficiency. By extension, if job seekers themselves are very capable, but they want to go to a high-paying unit but not to a low-wage unit, does this constitute discrimination against the latter? Even if it is, it is efficiency discrimination and should be justified. Just as when people get married, they would rather find someone with good family conditions than someone with poor conditions. This cannot be said to be discrimination against the latter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, under the severe employment situation, the key to giving students more and better job opportunities is to inspire entrepreneurs’ confidence and expectations for the future, so that they dare to invest real money Pay attention to expand investment and create more and better jobs. This requires respecting entrepreneurs&#39; autonomy in business operations and employment, and not denying the right of enterprises to &quot;select the best&quot; at every turn and weakening entrepreneurs&#39; motivation and confidence in investing and making bets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If companies are not allowed to show their recruitment preferences, there are only two consequences: First, companies hide their preferences in the short term but write them down in their hearts. This is nothing more than making job seekers do more useless work, which is detrimental to job hunting. Is it really good? Second, in the long run, companies will feel that the business environment and conceptual environment are not good, and they will be more cautious in investing and making bets. The process of job creation will be affected. What benefits will it bring to job seekers? In short, society should create a relaxed and rational conceptual environment for entrepreneurs, allowing them to use their intelligence and real money to promote our economy, which will ultimately benefit every job seeker. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 10:01:23 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[触碰寻亲直播间里的伤痛 | 记者手记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259121]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-24 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/10/23/e505f7e258.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/ 23/e505f7e258.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254952&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 14, 2023, Guiyang, Guizhou, four people searched for relatives The parents drove from Kunming, Yunnan, and traveled thousands of kilometers to find their son. (Southern Weekend reporter Liu Yixian/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Interview with Yang Niuhua’s abduction case (for details, see &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com /content/253854&quot;>;Human trafficker Yu Huaying was sentenced to death: she abducted 11 children and even sold her own son&lt;/a>;&quot;), this was the first time I got close to parents looking for relatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the morning of July 14, 2023, Yu Huaying, a human trafficker who abducted Yang Niuhua, was tried at the Intermediate People&#39;s Court of Guiyang City, Guizhou Province. Outside the court, people looking for relatives stood outside. Parents. Most of them wore white shirts with photos of their babies printed on them, and held missing persons signs with yellow characters on a red background. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Looking for his son Li Xianfang&quot;, &quot;Looking for his sons An Xu and An Biao&quot;, &quot;Marshmallow dad looking for his daughter Chen Yangmei&quot;... Each missing person sign is marked with The child’s date of birth, time of loss, physical characteristics at the time of loss, etc. Behind the sign, there were mostly sad faces, as if their facial features were drooped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;While waiting, some parents looking for relatives were also doing live broadcasts, introducing netizens to the progress of the trial and what was going on outside the court, interspersed with &lt;span>;&lt; /span>;Tell how your child was lost, where you went to find your child, and how you got here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I greeted several of the parents, informed the reporter of my identity, and recorded an interview video nearby. After that, as soon as I raised my cell phone to record the video, the parents next to me immediately came up to me, walked around holding the missing persons sign, and occasionally chatted. They know how to &quot;grab traffic&quot; and show their face at any possible opportunity to increase their exposure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This eagerness became more obvious after Yang Niuhua appeared. Parents looking for relatives swarmed up almost in a swarm, surrounding them from front to back, holding signs next to each other. Several times, Yang Niuhua was submerged in the family-seeking signs, and reporters could not find her at all. In the chaos, some parents thrust their missing persons tags into Yang Niuhua&#39;s hands, while others hung a backpack with missing family information on her body. Yang Niuhua understood the mood of these parents looking for relatives and did not refuse. These parents travel around all year round and appear in various hot scenes, striving to let their children see themselves and see that &quot;Mom and Dad are always looking for you.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the afternoon of the day when the trial ended, I knocked on the door of Yang Niuhua’s room, but I was surprised to find that the room was crowded with parents looking for relatives, on the beds and chairs. , the floor, and every corner were filled with people. They are all waiting in line to go to Yang Niuhua&#39;s live broadcast room to introduce their search for relatives. After Yang Niuhua successfully searched for relatives online in 2021, she attracted a lot of attention and accumulated more than 300,000 fans on the short video platform. On important days like court hearings, she is also willing to use her traffic to allow parents to go to the live broadcast room to spread information about finding relatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I sat down next to an aunt in her 50s and watched the live broadcast of people coming and going in the room. It was still mid-summer in July, and this aunt was wearing a long-sleeved pullover with her child’s information printed on it, and several pieces of clothing underneath. After some conversation, she said that she was from the Buyi ethnic group in Guizhou and was born with a disability in her left foot, making it difficult for her to walk long distances. But her husband was ill and bedridden, so she had no choice but to go out alone to find the child. As she spoke, she took off her left boot, revealing that the foot was deformed and looked unbearable. It’s hard to imagine how she followed the family search team to various places in Fujian and Guizhou these days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There is another &quot;marshmallow dad&quot; who impressed me deeply. His daughter was born in 2003 and disappeared in Kunming, Yunnan when she was 3 years old. When Yang Niuhua was being interviewed after the trial, he stood behind Yang Niuhua and suddenly cried uncontrollably. The sound got louder and louder, and finally he squatted on the ground and cried bitterly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For many years, &quot;Marshmallow Daddy&quot; has been doing business in a minivan, selling marshmallows while looking for children, while his wife sells balloons at home to support her life. On the homepage of &quot;Marshmallow Daddy&quot;&#39;s video account, he has been to multiple recognition sites where his family search was successful. The village supermarket in Rongjiang, Guizhou was a hot spot those days. He rushed to the village supermarket to look for his children. In order to save money, the four parents who were looking for relatives cooked their own meals along the way, setting up stoves and shelves in the open air to cook. The four of them spent more than 20 yuan a day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Finding relatives is difficult, and parents searching for relatives hate human traffickers. But they have different views on adoptive families. Some people support the same crime of buying and selling and believe that the person responsible for supporting the family should be held accountable. But more parents will emphasize that they just want to see their children, and they do not ask the children to return to their biological families, nor do they hold them responsible for supporting the family. A very important reason is that many abducted children are afraid of hurting the feelings of their adoptive parents and are unwilling to take the initiative to find relatives, which will increase the difficulty of finding relatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Yu Huaying&#39;s child abduction case, there are still several abducted children who are unwilling to formally recognize their relatives. They are trapped in complex family relationships and do not know what to do. There are also abducted children who have recognized their parents and are not close to their parents. The parent-child relationship is empty and it is not clear where to build it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the family search live broadcast room, parents called on their children who had doubts about their parentage to go to the public security bureau to collect blood and enter it into the family search database, so that one day they can successfully identify their relatives. , &quot;If you want to come back, come back. If you don&#39;t want to come back, you can stay and support your family.&quot;&lt;span>; &lt;/span>;This sentence may be full of pain and pain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I wish them an early reunion with their loved ones. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[睡眠保单规模有多大？如何常态化唤醒？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259165]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-24 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Sleep policies are being required to be cleared within a time limit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The State Administration of Financial Supervision and Administration recently issued a special notice to clean up “sleep policies” in personal insurance within a time limit. According to the notice, for &quot;sleep insurance policies&quot; generated between January 1, 2013 and June 30, 2023, special cleanup work will last for one year starting from October 2023. According to research conducted by researchers at the New Financial Research Center of Southern Weekend, various life insurance companies have begun to look for “owners” of “sleep policies”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why are there sleep insurance policies in China? How will the rights and interests of policyholders be guaranteed? What is the overseas experience in dealing with sleep policies? After studying overseas experience, researchers from Southern Weekend&#39;s New Financial Research Center believe that the cleanup of sleep policies cannot only rely on irregular supervision by regulatory agencies, but should establish an easy-to-check national system, and insurance companies should proactively disclose the status of sleep policies. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;What is&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; a “sleep policy”? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;What is a &quot;sleep policy&quot;? Wang Xiangnan, deputy director of the Insurance and Social Security Research Office of the Institute of Finance, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told a researcher at the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center that &quot;sleep insurance policy&quot; is not clearly defined. It generally refers to an insurance accident or an insurance contract that has expired but has not yet received compensation or Insurance benefits are paid upon maturity, and policies in which the validity of the insurance contract is suspended or terminated but the cash value has not yet been collected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center found that a similar concept abroad is &quot;unclaimed life insurance&quot;. Allstate Insurance Company (Allstate) specifically refers to the situation where the insured dies and the beneficiary fails to apply for insurance compensation. According to the U.S. government website, the United States combines unclaimed insurance income and unpaid wages, pensions, tax refunds, fund income, bond income, etc. into unclaimed funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In layman&#39;s terms, the &quot;sleeping policies&quot; that the State Financial Supervision and Administration Bureau requires to be cleaned up within a time limit this time are the policy owners who &quot;lost contact&quot; resulting in the policy being &quot;not claimed but not claimed&quot; and eventually being &quot;shelved&quot; by the insurance company. &quot;Insurance policy. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Sleep Policy&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Why did it come about&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Why did sleep insurance policies come into being? A partner at Beijing Datong Insurance Sales Company told researchers at the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center that there are many reasons why policy owners “lost contact”. For example, in some families, the elders bought an annuity without notifying their families, and before they could receive it, the elders passed away. This will result in no one applying for a claim; some consumers have purchased insurance, but due to changing contact information, interruption of payment, etc., the policy has expired, and they have forgotten about it and did not return the cash; many families do not keep and manage the insurance policies properly. , family members are unaware of each other’s policy holdings. It is generally difficult for insurance companies to process such policies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center also learned that orphan policies are also one of the reasons for the creation of sleep policies. &lt;span>;Orphan&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;Insurance&lt;/span>; only refers to &lt;span>;policies&lt;/span>; where no one has taken the initiative to provide follow-up services due to the resignation of the original marketing staff. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar to the reasons for domestic sleep insurance policies, foreign sleep insurance policies are also mostly caused by the &quot;loss of contact&quot; of policyholders for various reasons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For policyholders, &quot;sleep policy&quot; means a &quot;sleep fund&quot; or an &quot;insurance window period.&quot; The former corresponds to the situation where the insured has matured survival benefits and maturity benefits that have not been collected; while the latter occurs when the policy is suspended due to &quot;loss of contact&quot; and arrears. This means that the insurance company has the right to terminate the insurance contract. Based on this, this special cleanup operation organized by the State Administration of Financial Supervision and Administration can not only revitalize the &quot;idle funds&quot; sleeping in society, but also safeguard the rights and interests of consumers. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;How big are sleep policies&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The regulatory agency specifically issued a notice to clean up &quot;sleep insurance policies&quot; within a time limit. This means that the &quot;sleep policy&quot; cannot be ignored. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How big is the &quot;sleep policy&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from Southern Weekend’s New Financial Research Center found that, so far, regulatory authorities have not released nationwide statistics. One data that can be referenced is that in August 2014, the former China Insurance Regulatory Commission issued a notice that “all personal insurance issued after June 10, 1999 and effective as of 24:00 on June 30, 2014, with a payment period of more than one year shall be invalid.” &quot;Policies&quot; carried out a special cleanup, and a total of 18.5793 million lapsed personal insurance policies were found, with a cash value of 35.083 billion yuan. The &quot;lapsed personal insurance policies&quot; targeted by this special cleanup operation specifically refer to policies whose contract validity is suspended due to interruption of insurance payments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Sleep policy&quot; includes more than just &quot;life insurance lapse policy&quot;. It can be seen from this that the amount involved in sleep insurance policies should also be larger. Data from various places can serve as examples. Data disclosed by the Anhui Insurance Association shows that as of June 30, 2023, the number of unpaid survival insurance policies that Anhui personal insurance companies should receive is 77,900, involving an amount of 920 million yuan; according to China Banking and Insurance News, in 2022 In 2020, 40 personal insurance companies in Zhejiang carried out the &quot;Looking for Insurance Survival Benefit Recipients&quot; activity. As of December 31, 2020, Zhejiang (excluding Ningbo) had a total of 121,300 expired personal insurance policies with an amount of 779 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data from different insurance companies also show that sleep insurance is no small matter. Ping An Pension Insurance Zhejiang Branch recovered 140 million yuan in &quot;maturity survival funds&quot; for customers from April to August 2022. Xinhua Life official said that from 2021 to the present, Xinhua Insurance Zhejiang Branch has carried out activities to find survival allowance recipients. By visiting village committees and communities, seeking to find &quot;lost&quot; customers from bill-issuing banks, police stations, household registration centers, etc., a total of We recovered 2,193 &quot;lost&quot; customers, assisted them in the collection procedures, and paid 90.46 million yuan in survival benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Financial reports are not disclosed separately&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;How motivated are insurance companies to clean up sleep policies? Is the &quot;sleep money&quot; lying on the account a windfall for insurance companies? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center checked the financial reports of listed insurance companies and found that each company did not disclose this separately. This means that companies treat this as a normal insurance policy in their financial reports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A senior official from a listed insurance company confirmed in a survey by a researcher from the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center that from the insurance business side, insurance companies do not distinguish between &quot;sleep policies&quot; and &quot;sleep policies&quot; in their financial statements. Normal policy. &quot;Sleep insurance policies&quot; follow the same accounting standards as other insurance policies. For example, premium income is included in asset accounts, and insurance liability reserves are included in the &quot;withdrawal of insurance liability reserves&quot; account based on actuarially determined amounts. The reserve withdrawal ratio has many rules according to the type of insurance and reserve type, and the conditions of each insurance company are different. Coupled with factors such as long coverage periods and diverse policy statuses, “sleep policy” cleanup is a complex undertaking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A partner at another insurance sales company even said that insurance companies may not have the incentive to clean up sleep policies. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;How to wake up the &quot;sleep policy&quot;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;How to apply for a wake-up sleep policy overseas? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Securities Times reported in May 2020 that no one claims millions of dollars in life insurance rights every year in the United States. In 2023, the website of the Association of British Insurers quoted sources as conservatively estimating that forgotten and unclaimed insurance policies across the UK are expected to involve a total of 200 million pounds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center found that in the United States, consumers can either log in to the National Association of Insurance Regulators (NAIC) system to inquire, or they can find third-party agencies to help with inquiries. According to the American Family Life Insurance Company (Aflac) website, different states in the United States have different legal requirements for unclaimed insurance policies. In many cases, beneficiary retroactive policies have no time limit, and once a beneficiary submits the policy, the insurance company takes a few weeks to a month to process and pay out. In addition to receiving insurance benefits, beneficiaries can also receive part of the interest income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, in order to cooperate with the cleanup of &quot;sleep insurance policies&quot;, the State Financial Supervision and Administration Bureau also guided relevant agencies to research and establish a unified &quot;sleep insurance policy&quot; information inquiry platform for consumers to inquire independently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center believe that the cleanup of sleep insurance policies cannot only rely on irregular supervision by regulatory agencies. In addition to establishing a national unified policy query system as soon as possible, regulatory authorities and industry associations should require insurance companies Put reminders for policyholders at the forefront. At the same time, insurance companies should use financial technology to enable the tracking of sleep policies, and even use big data systems to check all policies once a year to achieve normalized wake-ups. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[新任中国足协主席宋凯：不能再出台“奇葩”政策]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259155]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-23 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On the 22nd, the new Chinese Football Association Chairman Song Kai came to Weifang, Shandong to watch the second China Youth Football League Men’s U15 finals , and held discussions with youth training and media representatives. This was his first public appearance as chairman of the Football Association. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the work ideas of the new Chinese Football Association, Song Kai said that Chinese football must make up its mind to follow the &quot;Long March Road&quot; in the future, regard youth training as a top priority, and also improve China&#39;s football through greater opening up. football competitiveness and ensuring that the policies of the Chinese Football Association are reasonable and stable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/4c31a52c7e5b9847bbfb84f41cf49701.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height= &quot;750&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/4c31a52c7e5b9847bbfb84f41cf49701.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255015&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chinese Football Association Chairman Song Kai (middle) and Chinese Football Association Vice Chairman Yuan Yongqing (right) and Xu Jiren at a media symposium&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Make youth training a top priority Come and catch us.”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The first stop after taking office was to inspect youth competitions. The message Song Kai wanted to convey was very clear: “If we want to revitalize football, we must first focus on youth training. In the future, the Chinese Football Association will make youth training a top priority. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song Kai said that on the one hand, high-level coaches should be encouraged to engage in youth training. &quot;Poor competitive performance first shows that training is not good. We do not have good coaches for youth training, and the salary of youth training coaches is indeed very different from that of professional teams. This is a real problem that needs to be gradually changed. The Chinese Football Association must strive to adopt policy regulations and Orientation, guiding the best coaches to focus on youth training.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, a high-level and stable youth competition system must be established. &quot;When they are 12 years old, Chinese players are at the same level as Japanese and Korean players, but by the age of 16, the gap is huge. This is mainly due to the gap in the competition system. Only by participating in more high-level competitions can players continue to grow. The problem with our competition system is that it is unstable , the youth competition system must remain stable and reasonable improvements can be made, but the overall framework must remain unchanged.&quot; Song Kai said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/c238d83b720e76683a63f3053a1db926.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height= &quot;667&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/c238d83b720e76683a63f3053a1db926.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255014&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;(File picture) Young players playing on the court. Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhou Mi&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Talking about what kind of youth training model Chinese football should adopt, Song Kai said: &quot;Currently, Chinese football youth training mainly includes professional clubs, professional sports teams, social institutions and campus football. Waiting for different routes, the Chinese Football Association must first consolidate its base areas and defend its basic market. It is unrealistic for Chinese football to completely return to the sports team model, but the policy guidance of the National Games can be used to increase the enthusiasm of provinces and cities and increase their commitment to football. support,&quot; Song Kai said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the basis of insisting on practicing internal skills, Song Kai believes that the development of youth training also requires the help of external forces. &quot;With the help of external forces, including inviting in, going out and naturalizing players, this can all be discussed. There is a gap between our understanding of youth training and that of developed countries in football, so we must learn with an open mind. The internationalization of youth training is very important. According to statistics, China is now There are 137 registered foreign teachers. In the future, we will continue to improve the internationalization of youth training coaches. Youth leagues can also consider relaxing nationality restrictions and increasing exchange opportunities.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images. infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/1f2957ee55bb560399fe419d8ecd75e9.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;725&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/ medias/image/23/10/23/1f2957ee55bb560399fe419d8ecd75e9.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255016&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;September 8, East AFC U15 Men&#39;s Football Championship, the Chinese team celebrated their victory at the award ceremony.

Song Kai said: &quot;The U15 players do give us some hope. By the 2034 World Cup, they will be in their prime. We must do a good job in this age group. All parties have suggested applying for the World Youth Championship and the World Youth Championship. The Chinese Football Association is currently considering it, and we are also discussing this matter with FIFA.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Chinese football will not work if it does not open up&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In his inaugural speech on the 16th, Song Kaiti To topics such as &quot;more openness&quot; and &quot;connecting with the AFC and relaxing restrictions on foreign aid&quot;. At this media symposium, Song Kai explained that he hopes to force Chinese football to improve its competitiveness through wider opening up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song Kai believes that Chinese football has been in a relatively closed environment for a long time, and players lack competition. &quot;Many industries have proven that only with full competition in an open market can low-cost and high-quality products be produced. Now the AFC is relaxing restrictions on foreign aid. The Saudi League plans to increase the number of foreign aid quotas for each team to 10. Others Everything is opening up, and Chinese football cannot do without opening up.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The long march of Chinese football requires players to walk together. How to let the players go on the long march? Education alone is not enough, but competition and a high elimination rate are also required . By expanding opening up, we will force Chinese players to improve their level in competition.&quot; Song Kai said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/2f5472dd47520d8bf451e2f807ca9892.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height= &quot;750&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/2f5472dd47520d8bf451e2f807ca9892.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255017&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For wider opening up This may lead to domestic players not being able to play football, and thus affecting the national team. Song Kai said frankly: &quot;Many national leagues, including Spain, relaxed their foreign aid policies, which caused great controversy in the country at the time. In the process of expanding the opening up of Chinese football, , there will definitely be pain, and the Chinese Football Association must remain determined. If domestic players cannot play in the Chinese Super League, they can go to lower-level leagues. The policy can only be more open and cannot go back.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song Kai At the same time, he said that the Chinese Football Association must move at a steady pace in expanding its opening up. &quot;We must not rush to introduce policies. We must use one year for all parties to fully discuss, think things over clearly, and then implement them step by step.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;The Chinese Football Association cannot introduce any more &#39;weird&#39; policies. Policy&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Song Kai said frankly that many policies of the Chinese Football Association were previously formulated haphazardly, which caused harm to the development of Chinese football. &quot;The Chinese Football Association can no longer introduce &#39;weird&#39; policies like the &#39;National Team League&#39; and &#39;U23 Player Policy&#39; in the future. If the Chinese Football Association wants to issue new policies, they must meet social expectations. This is the first bottom line during my term. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The new Chinese Football Association will establish smoother communication channels and communication mechanisms with the media. The truth will become clearer and clearer. We hope that the media will take the lead in discussing the future policies of the Chinese Football Association. We will not issue all A policy that no one agrees with,&quot; Song Kai said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/0630b7d37b470fe1489dbc794328769d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height= &quot;602&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/0630b7d37b470fe1489dbc794328769d.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255018&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;July 18 On the same day, the Chinese women&#39;s football team trained at the 2023 Women&#39;s World Cup Chinese Women&#39;s Football Base Camp at the Croatian Sports Center in Adelaide, Australia.

Management and construction level. &quot;Although it is useless to worry about the national team, we must build the national team well at the current level. If the team is well managed, it may be able to perform at 120%, but if it is not managed well, it can only perform at 60%. % level.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Chinese women&#39;s football team will usher in the Paris Olympic qualifiers at the end of this month, and the Chinese men&#39;s football team will participate in the 2026 US-Canada-Mexico World Cup Asian qualifiers in mid-November. Regarding these two key competition tasks, Song Kai said: &quot;We have recently strengthened the management of the Chinese women&#39;s football team, and have also recalled overseas players. The Chinese women&#39;s football team is competitive in Asia, and we must win the Olympic qualifiers. Good. Everyone is not very satisfied with the current situation of the Chinese men&#39;s football team. Although they beat the Vietnam team, their technical content was not high, and then they lost to the Uzbekistan team. I think Jankovic is a very good coach, and the coaching staff needs to sum up their experience. Lessons learned. We must work harder.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 23 Oct 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
