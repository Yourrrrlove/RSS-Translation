First, the &quot;ten minutes of silence between classes&quot; sparked heated discussion, and then the teacher&#39;s heavy burden of &quot;non-teaching tasks&quot; also became a hot search topic. Earlier, a school charged 200 yuan for a lunch break, which was also controversial. These things seem to me to be inextricably linked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some children were imprisoned in the classroom or even on their seats during recess, which made netizens sad. Recalling the free recess in their childhood, they couldn&#39;t help but ask: Why can&#39;t today&#39;s children be unrestrained during recess? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some media pointed out that some parents are to blame for their tendency to hold schools accountable. In order to reduce safety accidents, the school adopted a simple and crude &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach and banned running and jumping activities during recess. As for chronic consequences such as slow development of athletic ability and lack of social interaction, the school cannot take care of it. Therefore, the media called for loosening school management and dividing responsibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Parents holding schools accountable is indeed a pain in the ass for teachers. During a recess not long ago, two girls in my class were holding hands and spinning in circles. Later, the game was upgraded and they started spinning back to back. It was originally a warm and beautiful scene, but during acceleration, a girl fell to the ground, and her two front teeth were unfortunately shattered. I saw all this clearly, but it was through the video in the corridor. When the incident happened, I was downstairs, leading another class in physical education class across subjects. The student&#39;s teeth have become permanent teeth, and the parents are very worried. I reported it to the school step by step, and the safety office said after analysis that it was not a safety incident, but an accident that occurred while playing between classmates, and the parents of both parties could just negotiate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The parents of the girl who played together proposed that the treatment costs should be split equally between the two parties. However, the parents of the injured girl said that because the accident happened at school, the school should also be responsible. I was dealing with three parties and was very embarrassed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Parents are not unreasonable. In European and American countries where we often learn from educational experience, schools should theoretically be held responsible for accidents on campus. It&#39;s just that most parents don&#39;t tend to hold the school accountable. Instead, they negotiate on their own with the mentality that bumps and pains are inevitable in their children&#39;s growth. Campus accident insurance in these countries has wider coverage and can effectively reduce the financial burden on all parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I believe that in addition to the soft conditions of division of powers and responsibilities, hard conditions such as teacher-student ratio, school hours and campus venues are also important reasons that affect students’ freedom between classes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 3, Xinhua News Agency published an article titled &quot;The Ministry of Education Responds to the Problem of Being Restrained for 10 Minutes Between Classes.&quot; The article proposed that schools should &quot;strengthen the inspection of outdoor facilities and personnel on duty...minimize the risk of safety accidents and allow children to be happy and safe in their activities.&quot; This reasonable sentence made my heart rise in my throat: &quot;Personnel on duty.&quot; , what kind of personnel are they? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our school has never prohibited students from recess activities due to safety reasons, although chasing and fighting is absolutely prohibited. However, if there is an outbreak of influenza in a class, in order to avoid cross-infection, teachers and students will become tense during class breaks: teachers must take turns in the toilets and corridors, reminding students to wash their hands with hand sanitizer after going to the toilet, and not to stay in the corridors; The teacher should hand over the class and ensure that the classroom is supervised. The scope of students&#39; activities has been reduced, and teachers&#39; class breaks have been filled up, leaving no time for rest. Some colleagues have sprained while rushing to a classroom on another campus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many teachers often ask on various social media: &quot;When can teachers only do the job of teaching and educating people?&quot; Is it the teacher&#39;s job to take care of students during breaks? The incident of charging for lunch break while lying on the table clearly shows the contradiction behind this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As soon as the hot search came out, staff from the relevant departments responded quickly, saying that the charges were reasonable and approved by the government. Lunch break charges mainly take into account the overtime wages of teachers after class, and even if there is a fee subsidy, many teachers are not willing to pay for lunch breaks. Public opinion did not buy it, and netizens were confused: students take lunch breaks on their own, why do they need teachers to take care of them? Aren&#39;t we going to rest together? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not to mention that some schools do not allow custodial teachers to take breaks. Even if the school is &quot;lenient&quot;, after settling more than 30 or 40 students, then taking a while to relax is definitely not the same as taking a lunch break on your own. Feel. When students take lunch breaks at school, they essentially create a large class break; as long as students are in school, they are the school&#39;s safety responsibility, and the teachers are directly responsible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The government or school can purchase teachers’ lunch breaks through subsidies to ensure student safety. However, in the scattered classes, it is impossible for teachers to go to outdoor places with students in order to arrive at the classroom for the next class on time or to have a little communication with students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In developed countries, teachers do take care of recess and lunch breaks, but most of them adopt a class-based system, with &quot;one teacher per class&quot; and teachers follow the class. In our country, teachers are divided by subjects, and teachers need to teach across classes and grades. Traveling between different classrooms or even campuses often consumes an entire class period, and caring for students during class time has become an &quot;unbearable burden.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The advantages of the private class system are significant: teachers have a more comprehensive understanding of students, and teachers and students can form deeper connections; multi-subject teaching is conducive to cultivating students&#39; interdisciplinary awareness and avoiding teacher burnout. Why is it difficult to implement it in our country? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the examination selection system puts the pressure down to primary schools. Teachers who only focus on one subject can be more familiar with the &quot;test points&quot; and make it easier to take the test. Secondly, most European and American countries adopt small class teaching. Taking the ordinary public primary school where I am as an example, there are no less than 50 students in each class. Finally, most primary schools in Europe and the United States only have half-day classes. After teachers watch the students for half a day, they have complete time to prepare lessons in the afternoon. In order to match the work schedule of our parents, primary school students can stay in school for up to ten hours, from morning reading to lunch break and extended services. If a teacher has to take care of 50 students for a full day of classes and care, not to mention the mental stress, there will be absolutely no time for correcting homework and preparing lessons. What&#39;s more, teachers already have too many non-teaching tasks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Insufficient campus space is also one of the important reasons for restricting students’ freedom between classes. At this stage, the number of students is large and the campus is large. In cities where land is at a premium, school teaching buildings often have four or five floors. In order to cope with the pressure from the Education Bureau to expand enrollment, many old schools have expanded their original areas: the buildings have been built higher, but the playground and basketball courts are often still the same size as they were decades ago. As a result, even several classes in the physical education class had to compete for seats, not to mention the students swarming out during the ten-minute break. If you rush to the basketball court from the fourth or fifth floor, the ready bell will ring again before the ball is touched. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, except for the lucky ones whose classrooms are on the first floor, most students’ activity space is limited to the corridor outside the classroom door. If many students are running in such a small space, the probability of stampedes and collisions is unimaginable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, the birth rate in our country is declining, which may become an opportunity to implement the &quot;package system&quot;. However, along with the decline in the birth rate, there is also an increase in parents&#39; work pressure and an increase in social costs of raising children. It is difficult to change quickly the length of time students are in school and financial investment in education, and it is also difficult to change quickly the planning of outdoor space on campus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the current conditions, I have some immature attempts during class time: teaching children physical games that do not require a large space, such as &quot;carrot squat&quot;, &quot;rock paper scissors&quot; for feet, etc.; Take turns using flying chess and other toys. At the school level, it may be possible to adjust more 15-minute &quot;big breaks&quot; and organize classes to take turns going downstairs; if there is financial resources, break managers can be hired to strengthen care. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public public opinion’s attention to recess activities reflects the rising national attention to education. But returning recess to students cannot be solved simply by calling on schools to relax their hands and parents not to criticize teachers harshly. Only by improving the safety of students&#39; recess activities, expanding the space for recess activities, taking away some responsibilities from teachers and returning teachers to students can we truly allow students to run freely during recess. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a primary school teacher in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010; &quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The &quot;hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of Southern Weekend App is looking forward to your contributions.

Since the beginning of the 1990s, I have been thinking about a question: In a modern society, what can traditional culture still do? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Reform and opening up brought a &quot;cultural craze&quot; to the ideological circles at that time. Chen Lai remembers that the most popular one was the editor-in-chief of the &quot;Towards the Future&quot; series at the time. Bao Zunxin said, &quot;When he went to Peking University and said a word, the crowd applauded.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The school of thought, represented by Bao Zunxin and others, believes that Confucianism is incompatible with modern spirit, which has caused the decline of society, the ignorance of the public and the country&#39;s decline in modern times. Being poor and weak needs to be reviewed or even abandoned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the beginning, Chen Lai was just a bystander of the &quot;cultural craze&quot;. He is the first independently trained doctor of philosophy in New China. In the autumn of 1977, Chinese colleges and universities resumed postgraduate enrollment, and Chen Lai read the news in the newspaper. A week later, he went from his workplace in the eastern suburbs of Beijing to register at Peking University in the western suburbs of Beijing, and finally chose the Chinese philosophy major. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Philosophy is the traditional strength major of Peking University. After the major restructuring of departments in 1952, all philosophy teachers from universities across the country gathered at Peking University. In the following years, the Department of Philosophy at Peking University was the only philosophy department in the country. A large number of outstanding scholars such as Tang Yongtong, Feng Youlan, Jin Yuelin, Zhu Guangqian, Zhang Dainian, Ren Jiyu, etc. gathered in Yanyuan, which can be called the &quot;Jixia Academy of the 20th century&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the resumption of enrollment in the late 1970s, the Chinese Philosophy Teaching and Research Office, where Zhang Dainian was the director, enrolled the first 10 graduate students, and Chen Lai was one of them. Chen Lai recalled that more than 200 people applied for the History of Chinese Philosophy exam at Peking University this year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the context of Western modernization ideas constantly attacking the Chinese cultural world, Chen Lai returned to Chinese tradition and completed his doctoral thesis &quot;Study on the Philosophy of Zhu Xi&quot; in 1985 , made a detailed and detailed investigation of Zhu Xi&#39;s philosophical thoughts and development. Soon after, he visited Harvard University for two years. After noticing the &quot;cultural craze&quot; in China and the ubiquitous Christian tradition in the United States, he began to think about the relationship between traditional culture and modern society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, in the &quot;cultural craze&quot; in China, an important issue was how to promote cultural modernization, and how to treat traditional Confucianism and traditional culture was the focus of debate. The opinions of Bao Zunxin and others once prevailed. When many scholars were &quot;cutting their ties&quot; with Confucianism, Chen Lai&#39;s voice seemed out of place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1987, at the &quot;China in the New Era&quot; international symposium held in Manila, Philippines, Chen Lai submitted a paper &quot;Review and Prospect of Modern Chinese Thought&quot;, It opposes the complete eradication of traditional culture, including Confucianism, advocates the protection of traditional culture, holds a cultural conservatism stance, and boldly makes the judgment that &quot;the greatest condition for the revival of traditional thought is modernization.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In February of the following year, at the International Symposium on &quot;Issues and Prospects of the Development of Confucianism&quot; held in Singapore, in response to the views of Bao Zunxin and others, Chen In response, he submitted a paper &quot;Confucianism and its Positioning in a Multicultural Structure&quot;. He talked about the spread of money worship, utilitarianism, opportunism and undisguised greed in society, and the young generation was at a loss in an atmosphere of emptiness. Siblings. It is precisely in this utilitarian trend and value rupture that the value rationality of Confucianism can provide a set of ethical values ​​and a humanistic worldview that are compatible with modernization reforms and guide the spiritual direction of contemporary Chinese people. He pointed out that modern society is a multicultural society, in which Confucianism does not propose specific designs for reform, but rather proposes a humanistic worldview that complements reform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;To this day, China&#39;s ideological circles are still digesting the legacy of the &quot;cultural craze&quot; many years ago. The direction of history is as he judged, and the craze for traditional culture continues to this day. Chen Lai is worried: &quot;In every era and every activity, when someone advocates it, some people will excessively push these things to extremes. This is worthy of vigilance.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Mr. Zhang For classes, read Mr. Feng’s book”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After the degree system was restored, You applied for a graduate degree in the Philosophy Department of Peking University and later became the first independently trained doctor of philosophy in New China. Can you talk about your educational experience? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Lai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I am the first batch of graduate students after the reform and opening up. In October 1977, the country officially announced that it would recruit college students through the college entrance examination. A month later, &quot;People&#39;s Daily&quot; published another news, which was to resume the postgraduate enrollment system. At the time of admission, because there was no official document stating the nature of the postgraduate degree, we all thought that this postgraduate degree was equivalent to the Soviet associate doctoral degree. Associate doctoral students were recruited from universities in the 1950s after the country learned from the Soviet Union&#39;s experience. They are equivalent to doctoral students in the West, because in the Soviet Union, there were full doctorates on top of associate doctoral degrees, and they almost required professors. At that time, the personnel treatment for returning to China after obtaining an associate doctoral degree in the Soviet Union was equivalent to that for those who obtained a doctoral degree in Western countries. However, by 1957, this system was abolished, and associate doctorates were no longer recruited. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;When we entered school, we also thought it was based on the associate doctorate. Everyone has higher expectations for themselves, and they are all based on the standard of a doctorate. Asked by myself. It wasn’t until the second semester of the second year of graduate school that the country introduced a new system, saying that our first batch of graduate students were master’s students, which was not equivalent to associate doctorate students in the Soviet Union, but was one level lower than doctorate students in the United States. At that time, everyone still Not so satisfied. But we are disappointed. In terms of professional attainments, our first batch of graduate students strived to reach the Soviet Union&#39;s associate doctorate level at the master&#39;s level, which is close to the level of American doctorates. &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;What was the opportunity to continue studying for a PhD? What were the criteria for awarding doctorates at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Lai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After graduating from graduate school in the fall of 1981, I stayed at Peking University to teach. The next year, the school announced the list of the first batch of doctoral supervisors. With the doctoral supervisors, it was stated that they would continue to award doctorates. I also decided to give it a try. Later, I was changed from a teacher to a doctoral candidate, and my original salary was paid as usual. There was nothing special about it. In addition to English writing and speaking courses, I basically focus on writing my doctoral thesis. At that time there were no clear criteria for awarding degrees. Now when you are studying for a Ph.D., you will have clear requirements for being awarded a Ph.D. after being admitted. For example, Tsinghua University School of Humanities stipulates that the number of words for a doctoral thesis should be between 150,000 and 200,000 words. We didn&#39;t establish it in this way when we were in school, so we relied on our own imagination. Referring to the requirements of the Soviet Union&#39;s associate doctorate, we probably had to write about 200,000 words. &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;What do you think are the characteristics of the education you received at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Lai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The education we received is different from that of Chinese students in the 1950s and 1960s. Likewise, previous education was severely disrupted and academically weak. Speaking of my major in Chinese philosophy, there were two old gentlemen at that time, one was Mr. Feng Youlan and the other was Mr. Zhang Dainian. Mr. Zhang gave us two courses: Historical Materials of the History of Chinese Philosophy and Methodology of the History of Chinese Philosophy. Mr. Feng stopped taking classes because he was older. Once upon a time, a reporter summarized my words and said that the characteristic of our postgraduate studies was &quot;taking Mr. Zhang&#39;s class and reading Mr. Feng&#39;s books.&quot; Mr. Feng and Mr. Zhang were already leading scholars in our discipline in the 1930s, so the professional education we received was directly connected to the academic and educational traditions of the 1930s and 1940s, while those students in the 1950s received It was an education influenced by Soviet experts. &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;What role did these two gentlemen play in your life? What learning methods did you learn from them? &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Lai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Mr. Zhang is my mentor, from scratch to PhD degree , Mr. Zhang’s academic thoughts and academic methods had a great influence on me. He specifically guided me from the primary stage of learning to the advanced stage. After graduation, I worked as an assistant to Mr. Feng, mainly helping him compile the &quot;New History of Chinese Philosophy&quot;. I took the initiative to learn from Mr. Feng through conversations, how to learn from him and how to think philosophically. Unlike Mr. Zhang, Mr. Feng helped me rise to a higher level after I had already reached a relatively advanced stage. &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Mr. Zhang&#39;s academic method can be said in one sentence to be &quot;easy to learn and think deeply, and know what he means.&quot; The original words of this sentence come from Sima Qian&#39;s &quot;Historical Records&quot;: &quot;If you don&#39;t love to learn and think deeply, and know its meaning in your heart, you will be short-sighted and ignorant.&quot; Mr. Zhang extracted the eight words &quot;Love to learn and think deeply, and know its meaning in your heart&quot; to emphasize research. When studying the history of Chinese philosophy, on the one hand, we must conduct an in-depth and detailed interpretation of the literature to grasp its original meaning; on the other hand, we must use a clear logical analysis method to explain it layer by layer, and we must not swallow it in a hurry or explain it vaguely. Confused, this clear logical analysis method was called &quot;analyzing names and analyzing principles&quot; in ancient China. This is the fundamental method and attitude for studying and researching the history of Chinese philosophy. It can also be said to be the basic method I learned from Mr. Zhang. My doctoral thesis &quot;Study on Zhu Xi&#39;s Philosophy&quot; is to study Zhu Xi&#39;s philosophy using the method of &quot;love to learn and think deeply, and know the meaning from the heart&quot;, which fully reflects Mr. Zhang&#39;s influence on me. Mr. Feng has been a philosopher for a long time, and his research focuses on thinking about the realm of life in philosophy. Later I published another book called &quot;The Realm of Being and Absence&quot;. This &quot;realm&quot; is the &quot;realm&quot; of &quot;realm&quot;. When I was studying Wang Yangming, I put the issue of realm at the center. This was also inspired by Mr. Feng&#39;s The influence of realm emphasis. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot; font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;As a teacher now, what methods do you teach your students? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Lai: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Now I ask students to still emphasize Mr. Zhang’s method, because Mr. Zhang’s method helps students move from the primary stage to the advanced stage.

In your 1987 article &quot;Review and Prospect of Modern Chinese Thought&quot;, you made &quot; &quot;The greatest condition for the revival of traditional thought is modernization&quot;, holding a cultural conservatism stance and opposing the complete eradication of tradition. Why did you choose this stance at that time? Has this position been established since your research on Zhu Xi? &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Lai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The relationship between tradition and modernity was the most heated discussion in academic circles in the 1980s Regarding the issue, I started doing research on Zhu Xi in 1979, and when I completed it in 1985, I still didn’t have such a position. It wasn’t until 1986 that I visited Harvard University in the United States and observed that Christian traditions are ubiquitous in modern society in the United States. This made me think about the relationship between tradition and modernity, and whether we must completely oppose tradition. Only by completely breaking away from tradition like the New Culture Movement can we move towards modernization. Some people at that time believed that tradition was feudalism and that we must be more resolute in our anti-feudalism in order to move toward openness and modernity. I wrote some articles at that time, firmly opposing the complete eradication of tradition, and I was still writing articles on this stance until the 1990s. This is parallel to my academic research. On the one hand, I have relatively pure academic research, and on the other hand, I continue to participate in discussions of social and cultural trends of thought. &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It should be said that I have two positions, one is cultural conservatism, and the other is cultural openness. I would like to emphasize cultural conservatism. American sociologist Daniel Bell once said that cultural conservatism is mainly aimed at the cultural tendency of over-commercialization in modern society, emphasizing authority and cultural value in culture, and focusing on protecting the value of traditional culture. . However, since the mid-1990s, some dogmatists have stigmatized cultural conservatism, calling it extreme retroism and conservatism. This is wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;mentioned at that time that &quot; Is &quot;conservative&quot; a bit sensitive? &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Lai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The concept of &quot;conservatism&quot; does not seem to mean much in modern China. Very positive, but in Western concepts, &quot;conservative&quot; is not necessarily a bad word, but can reflect positive values. Cultural conservatism is a cultural attitude that values ​​the culture that humans have created and inherited throughout history. I emphasized from the beginning that cultural conservatism is not political conservatism and has nothing to do with politics. However, when some people hear cultural conservatism, they think it is against reform and opening up. In fact, this is not what it really means. It is about culture. value. &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;You mentioned in the Qizhi interview that you suffered attacks from some scholars because of your insistence on Chinese culture in the late 1980s. For example, you mentioned that in those years, your important academic works also won awards in various awards. Only the third prize can be awarded. With the development of the times, your position has gradually been recognized and realized. Have you personally experienced the process of moving from the edge to the center? &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Lai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The description from edge to center is not appropriate and I was shocked. At that time, I was not on the edge. Now that I am not affected by it, I cannot be said to be in the center. These blows only affected my personal situation and did not affect my own academic development and progress. &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;You have always been firm in your stance. Many people may have stopped speaking out after being hit. Why are you so persistent? &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Lai: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Because what I said is right, on the contrary, those things that hit me I find their behavior very despicable, but I don’t care that much. I will do my own thing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In recent years, traditional culture has become more and more popular among young people In your opinion, what changes have occurred in the “traditional culture craze” in China? Which of these are exciting, and which are cause for alarm? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Lai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I can intuitively feel that young people are becoming more and more interested in elements of traditional culture. Interests, like wearing Hanfu, etc. In principle, it is gratifying to absorb the elements of traditional culture and adopt them in today&#39;s cultural forms. For example, many of the cultural and creative products in various places are related to local cultural traditions or Chinese cultural traditions. . &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As for what we need to be vigilant about, in abstract terms, it is the promotion of traditional culture, which should be more natural and should not be blunt or rigid. Excessive promotion away from natural needs. For example, in the past few years, there were many classic reading classes for children, which required children to memorize hundreds of thousands or even 200,000 words. I think this is unnecessary. When children learn traditional culture, it becomes their values ​​in life, and it doesn’t matter how much they memorize. In every era and every activity, when someone advocates it, there will be people who push these things to extremes. This is something to be wary of. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73442&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70251&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/c856153e2f.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;VCG111457714756.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;October 4, 2023, Nanjing, Tourists wearing Hanfu visit the Laomendong Scenic Area.

Confucius founded Confucianism. Disciples continued to pass it on, but because it was in the Warring States Period, the ruling class at that time was particularly interested in military doctrine, that is, how to develop the military. They had a more positive attitude towards the Legalist thoughts of the pre-Qin era and felt that Legalist methods could be effective immediately. They were very interested in Confucianism. No interest. In the Han Dynasty, a unified country based on the system of prefectures and counties was formed. The ruling class deeply reflected on the rapid demise of the Qin Dynasty. At first, they wanted to replace Legalism with Taoism, but they soon found that the Taoist attitude was only suitable for There was no active governance strategy for the restoration of the economic ecology after the war, so Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty decided to only respect Confucianism and regard Confucianism as the leading value. The following dynasties did not change much. They all used Confucian values ​​​​to implement state governance. Of course, they were not just Confucianists, but also absorbed Taoist and Legalist ideas. &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In modern times, Western learning based on the Scientific Revolution and the Industrial Revolution entered China. The society was in a period of transformation, and the traditional society was going to Modern society based on the scientific revolution and technological revolution has some different attitudes towards traditional culture and traditional thoughts during this period. The most important one is total westernization, which takes a negative stance towards traditional Chinese culture including Confucianism. At the same time, there are also some The other type, with a relatively small number of people, adheres to Confucianism and traditional culture and has its positive significance - although the social foundation has changed, as a result of wisdom gained from historical human exploration of nature, society, life, including literature and art, Traditional culture and Confucianism are not meaningless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Can it be understood as Are the values ​​advocated by Confucianism particularly important to social reform and transformation? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Lai: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It’s not just values, of course values ​​are included. The &quot;Review and Prospects of Modern Chinese Thought&quot; I wrote in 1987 was aimed at the reform issues at that time. At that time, some theorists actually put forward the slogan &quot;Everything depends on money.&quot; I emphasized at that time that &quot;all things are about money&quot; would never become the spiritual tradition of a great nation. The role of Confucianism in the process of modernization and reform is not to propose specific designs for reform, but to propose a humanistic worldview that complements reform. The task or function of Confucianism is not to directly promote reforms, but to provide a humanistic spirit that complements modernization reforms to guide people&#39;s general spiritual direction. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Confucianism does not have to be directly related to the social transformation of Westernization. Social modernization can occur while basic values ​​remain unchanged. of. For example, Japan&#39;s basic cultural values ​​did not change much from 1880 until its economy re-developed in the 1960s. No region in Asia with Confucian culture first overthrew Confucian culture before achieving modernization. The success of modernization in regions and countries such as Hong Kong, South Korea, and Singapore has proven that societies that have grown up under the influence of Chinese culture can achieve modernization well. In a developed modern market economy, the general trend of commercialization makes the moral norms and spiritual civilization requirements of this society more prominent than before. In the era of big pot rice, this problem is not prominent. Therefore, the value and significance of Confucian modernization are not just viewed from the perspective of utilitarianism. The most important thing is that in an era when commercialization is prevalent, market economy and utilitarianism require a value system to constrain and regulate society as a whole. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Now in the general sense From what angle do you consider the revival of Confucianism?

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;比如9月我在山东，去到曲阜圣贤教育学校，他们两个校长的理念就是用儒学的观念来引导教育，不是学习内容都学这个，而是用儒学来进行引导。不管是小学还是中学，学生每天上学的第一堂课都是学习儒学经典，还有一些类似于禅修的活动，来帮助学生变得更加安定、沉下心来进行学习。学生接受起来很容易，家长也感觉到学生在这个学校里不是浮躁的，比较安静，我觉得是很有成效的。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你在《守望传统的价值》一书中谈到塑造中国人的精神气质，最重要的是通过教育，你对通过教育来重建儒学的价值体系是否乐观？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;陈来：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;重建儒学的价值体系有很多方面的工作，中小学的课程教育是一个方面。最近十年我们对传统文化的强调，从教育环境上来说是更有利于中华传统文化的创造性转化、创新性发展。但是这个工作也要得到整个社会的认同，从政府领导、制度规定体系再到基层的学校教师，都坚持下去才能做好。现在这种共识比以前好多了，重建我们的文教体系应该是乐观的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你是否有关于社会价值规则的终极设想？是什么样的文化结构？儒学在其中是什么角色？ &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;陈来：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我在1988年的论文《多元文化结构中的儒学及其定位》中就说了，我自己的意愿是，在一个新的文化结构中，不但有民主、科学等制度化的建构，以及形式合理的经济结构所提供的人的利益动机，应使儒学仍然成为中国人的价值来源之一，提供给中国人做人的道理、人生的意义及处世的原则规范，乃至对宇宙、自然、社会、人类命运的基本态度。今天我们的文化结构不像传统社会的那种单一的结构，一定是多元的结构，儒学不是要做意识形态，而是作为文化气质、精神气质对国民有一个主导的影响。 &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;陈来：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;每个时代选择哲学的人都是少数，哲学从来不是一个大众的学问，而是一个小众的文化领域，但是它的作用很大。现在社会比较功利，所以选择的人会更少，这是一个事实，不过我觉得也没关系，因为它本身就是少部分人去追求的。但从机遇上来讲，今天的中华民族在世界上的地位不一样了，我们搞哲学的人也比较从容了，不像原来那样受西方文化的挤压，现在我们想的是怎么把这么多年领会的西方的东西与我们传统的东西结合起来，形成一种新的哲学思考。所以，在今天这个时代研究哲学适逢其时。 &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;陈来：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我觉得这些情况既不奇怪，也不需要去关注，更不需要批判。我们要看到的是就业的多元化，大家都应该有多元的选择。至于选择躺平和全职儿女，一个原因是社会创造了这种能够让他躺平的条件，在生活上有保障。其实躺平、全职儿女不仅不符合传统文化里的观念，也不符合现代社会的理念。但是，一方面我们不能轻易对那些关心个人命运的选择加以谴责，另一方面也要鼓励有强烈理想主义、愿意承担责任的年轻人去奔向更大的目标。比如有些学生毕业以后，愿意到哪个地方去支教，这些应该鼓励。 &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;陈慧翎从小被“放养”长大，早早就知道了自己的兴趣在哪里。中学一年级的作文课，因为想表达的东西太多，她写了厚厚一本。老师非常仔细地改完，并鼓励她继续写作。这在13岁的陈慧翎心里埋下了一颗种子——“啊，我可以写欸。那我要继续写。”就这样，陈慧翎开始一点一点地创造属于她的艺术世界。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;实际上，在2008年刚出道时，她就凭借个人首部戏剧作品《黄金线》一举拿下第43届台湾电视金钟奖戏剧节目导演奖。同年作品《与男友的前女友密谈》又获得了金钟奖迷你剧集编剧奖和剪辑奖。因此，《下一站，幸福》对于陈慧翎来说，更像是一个契机，将她的作品推向更为大众化的舞台。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她始终将视角聚焦于人与人之间细微的情感交流。之后的三年里，她又创作了夺得第45届台湾电视金钟奖戏剧节目导演奖的《那年，雨不停国》、爱情剧《拜金女王》、剧情长片《吉林的月光》等作品。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2013年陈慧翎被查出患有宫颈癌，此后10年，病情多次复发。命运的玩笑没能阻挡她创作和享受生活的脚步：每次一结束疗程，她就趁状态尚好出国游玩，并在2016年执导了单元剧《滚石爱情故事》，2019年又凭借《你的孩子不是你的孩子》再度获评金钟奖最佳导演。在采访中，她提到了自己对华人世界父母与子女关系的思考——“一个婴儿饿了会哭，一个青少年他渴求爱，就不能哭，不能叫吗？我们这一代已经（在这样的氛围下）好不容易长大了，难道还要这样对我们的孩子吗？”2023年2月，她还去土耳其参与了强震的救灾工作。&lt;/p>;

This was not Zhan Danian’s original intention when he founded this school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Ugly Duckling&quot; originally accepted so-called &quot;problem children&quot; that ordinary schools and families were unable to take care of. Zhan Danian discovered that the rate of depression among students has increased in recent years and was determined to help them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This time, he hopes to use the forum to arouse more people&#39;s attention to the phenomenon of teenage depression. A month ago, I heard Zhan Danian talk about this topic for the first time on the phone. I admired this middle-aged educator for his sense of social responsibility - but also secretly thought: a private school aimed at helping &quot;problem students&quot; , do you have enough professionalism and experience to share (on dealing with student depression)? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the three or four days I went to Yiliang, my doubts were solved bit by bit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At noon on the day we arrived at the school, a small book-sized window at the gate was opened, revealing the smiling faces of several children: Auntie, we will ask someone to open the door for you. After entering the door, Zhan Danian was standing by the playground. When they saw me, they started introducing me directly from the teaching building. When he walked into the psychology room, several children greeted him with a smile, &quot;Zhan Zhan, do you still remember me?&quot; In the painting room inside, two boys were quietly drawing mandalas without raising their heads. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During those days of &quot;ugly duckling&quot;, students were all at ease wherever they went. Except for military training and physical education classes, which require gathering on time, at other times, these children cannot see the tension of being disciplined, the exhaustion after excessive homework, and social numbness. It was the &quot;Class Culture Week&quot; and there were many children drawing in the stairwells and dormitories during class. During the interview, looking at their relaxed expressions as they chatted easily, and greedily taking a few deep breaths of the warm air on the mountain, I really felt: This is a normal campus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you get closer to these children, you will find that many of them are &quot;ridden with holes.&quot; A colleague read the manuscript and said, &quot;Today&#39;s children, aged fourteen or fifteen, have so many things on their minds...&quot; In fact, every child has an interesting soul. &quot;Things on the Heart&quot; are related to their tortuous experiences and are also their normal reactions to this weird world. It would be strange if all the excitement, curiosity, and attempts are constantly broken, misinterpreted, and &quot;formatted.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Back to my doubts at the beginning of the interview. Xu Kaiwen, a Ph.D. in clinical psychology at Peking University, followed up on 10 families who lost their only child during the fifth anniversary of the Wenchuan earthquake. He found that families that recovered well from the trauma had “improved living conditions and localized emotional regulation, like playing mahjong. This kind of down-to-earth social support system may be more effective than psychological counseling.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is no different for teenagers. In addition to children with symptoms of severe depression who should be treated through medical means, most teenagers need nothing more than understanding and listening. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Plenty of sunshine, regular physical exercise, teaching that is not aimed at cramming or exam-taking, time for daze, opportunities to express without fear, and equality between teachers and students. Whether it&#39;s a teacher, a classmate or a parent, there is always someone who understands you. When you feel down, use him as your tree hole or &quot;handrail&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These should be the growth atmosphere that every school-age child and teenager has the right to enjoy. Now it has become a luxury and even consensus cannot be reached. Rather than visiting the Ugly Duckling Middle School in search of a cure for children’s depression, it would be better to see how a shielded educational common sense is put into practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two days before publishing this article, Zhan Danian received another WeChat message from the parent of a first-year high school student. The latter told him that another student in his child’s school chose to leave in a decisive way. &quot;As parents, we are all frightened.&quot; This parent&#39;s child was also diagnosed with severe depression through a scale when he was in seventh grade. The child&#39;s parents have been committed to changing their relationship with their child. The family atmosphere is very good now. &quot;But we are in a county, and we are very scared when such a situation occurs. How should we accompany our children?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, they are not alone. After the forum, in addition to the WeChat group of 500 participants who continued to share various mutual aid information, a new WeChat group was added, and everyone discussed establishing an alliance to prevent and treat youth depression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;We need to look for technologies and methods, hoping that the group will get better and better.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 13 Nov 2023 09:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[马伯庸回应拒签盗版书：精神产品生产者的声誉有多重要？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260486]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-13 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, some netizens posted that they saw this scene at the Nanjing offline meeting of writer Ma Boyong: An uncle asked a writer to sign a book, but &quot;he was scolded by the staff&quot; that the book was pirated. &quot;Anyone with a discerning eye could see his embarrassment.&quot; This netizen believed that the staff were &quot;arrogant&quot; and that the writer &quot;didn&#39;t do anything to support the staff&quot;, &quot;made me feel like I was about to lose the house&quot;, &quot;very disappointed&quot; and &quot;held hundreds of book signings a year&quot; In a writer I see only his substance.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This netizen expressed the battle between reason and emotion. On the one hand: understanding that genuine editions protect the rights of writers. On the other hand, he said: Just like Teacher Yu Hua said, &quot;My books should be pirated.&quot; He is not supporting piracy, but he really hopes that at that moment he can stand up to protect a reader&#39;s love for him; the more he thinks about it, the more sad he becomes. , the more I admire Teacher Yu Hua. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, Ma Boyong himself responded: I really can’t sign pirated books. After all, I haven’t reached the level of Teacher Yu Hua. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This incident is undoubtedly a storm in a tea cup, but there is indeed something to interpret. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, it is normal for different writers to have different views on their books being pirated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The occurrence of piracy is often a reflection of &quot;book sales&quot; and &quot;popular works&quot;. In this sense, piracy is a writer&#39;s medal. It can even be said: How can one be called a &quot;writer&quot; if he has never been pirated? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, writer Yu Hua’s words are contextual and cannot be understood as support and endorsement of piracy. He said this on at least two public occasions. Once he said: &quot;I never fight against piracy. There is mainly such a poor consumer group. They also want to read, so they buy a few cheap pirated books... If this problem is not solved, my books will be pirated. It should be&quot;; another said: &quot;It is right that my book should be pirated, because at least it is better than food safety. You solve the food safety problem and then solve the piracy problem.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every time Yu Hua said this, the focus was not on piracy, but on a specific social issue. The first time was &quot;poor consumer groups&quot; and the second time was &quot;food safety.&quot; In fact, if the losses caused by piracy are not huge but the cost of settlement is high, expressing your attitude and gaining reputation in this way is also the right choice. After all, a good reputation is a very important asset for a producer of spiritual products. Moreover, he believes that the &quot;piracy problem&quot; needs to be solved, and does not believe that &quot;piracy is justified&quot; or &quot;piracy is justified.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s understandable even if the author himself hates his books being pirated. Pirated copies are far cheaper than genuine copies. On the one hand, this allows people who cannot afford genuine copies to afford them and satisfy their intellectual and spiritual needs. On the other hand, it also makes some readers who would otherwise buy genuine copies buy pirated copies instead. Piracy with typos has long been a thing of the past. Today’s authentic photocopies, electronic versions, or electronic print versions have almost no difference in reading experience from the original version. This will affect the sales of the original version and harm the interests of publishers and authors. There are even some sales channels that mix genuine copies with pirated copies, and the latter is more profitable. Many readers spend the price of genuine copies to buy pirated copies. This is essentially a form of fraud, and it also infringes upon those who were kept in the dark. Reader Rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, on this basis, how to clarify the right and wrong of this incident? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For an extremely successful best-selling author like Ma Boyong, he has no problem with being averse to piracy. In his response, he said that he felt sorry for the readers who unknowingly bought pirated copies. In the past, he would spend his own money to buy more than a dozen books to keep. If he found out that the readers had pirated copies, he would give them a genuine copy, but later the pirated copies were really It is so rampant that sometimes nearly 1/3 of the books brought by authors on site are pirated copies. It was embarrassing and burdensome, so I changed the method and set up on-site genuine sales. Readers who accidentally bought a pirated copy can buy a new one. &quot;You don&#39;t have to queue up again, just come to me to sign it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Readers who spend time and money to get autographs from authors should do so because they particularly like the author and his works, and generally do not intentionally buy pirated books. Therefore, most of the readers who brought pirated books thought they were cheated by the channels and bought pirated copies with genuine money. Therefore, both arrangements before and after are decent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the on-site staff really &quot;scolded&quot; the uncle who signed the pirated book, then the only thing worth improving is the attitude issue. This type of signing event is usually organized by publishing houses. It is possible that the staff of the publishing house will be angry when they see such a high proportion of pirated books and the interests of the publishing house being infringed upon. In this sense, even if Ma Boyong is particularly generous, it is inappropriate to accept pirated books and sign them all, because this is generosity to others and detrimental to the interests of the publishing house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, how do you view writers as producers of spiritual products and their pursuit of material interests? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A gentleman loves money and gets it in a wise way. In theory, this principle applies to any profession, but producers of spiritual products are indeed very different from producers of material products, and reputation and reputation are much more important. Readers as consumers have two special psychological expectations for the former. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, especially for an author who is a spiritual mentor, readers will expect him to conform to the image of a wise man or a saint: the best image is to be immortal, with a transcendent and elegant air, and in moral terms You are a lot higher than the world, at least you can&#39;t show your love for money or greed for material benefits, because if you are as &quot;tacky&quot; as me, what else do you have that I can admire and look up to? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Boyong’s response obviously understood the reader’s psychology. He did not explain why he disliked piracy, nor did he clarify whether there was any “scolding”. He only said that “it is inevitable to be negligent in doing things, and there will always be mistakes.” A satisfactory place&quot;, and spend a lot of space on empathizing with the reader, telling how he enjoys the interaction with the reader, &quot;treating the reader as a friend&quot;, and demonstrating that he is not materialistic. This is an effective way to protect his reputation. Act of. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, for producers of spiritual products, readers will expect their behavior to be consistent with the values ​​expressed in books or in public. If a writer promotes a high moral standard or expresses a certain value tendency in a book, but fails to achieve it or does not do it consistently in practice, or is perceived as such by readers, then the reader may turn from love to hate, or from fans to fans. black. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This netizen said, &quot;The writer who likes little people the most and is good at portraying little people has also become a big shot after becoming famous.&quot; &quot;I bought an umbrella on the road, but my heart was already wet.&quot; He knows the truth of &quot;piracy is wrong&quot;, but whether it is true love no longer or misunderstanding or wrong love, this feeling is extremely real. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 13 Nov 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[五星评分打底的宣传，就这？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260484]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;If you are a director and the screenwriter writes How would you shoot a rape scene? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Should we use a large aperture to focus on the victim&#39;s painful face and the perpetrator&#39;s twisted body, or should we use a blurred lens to express violence with a line of blood, a cry of pain, and an angry and struggling hand? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you were a director, how would you show the pain of a single mother who lost her only daughter and did not hesitate to die with her enemies? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Should I express my mother’s feelings without any elaboration and use a few sensational lines and music, or should I express my anger at my daughter’s stigmatization, my despair at the distorted truth, and my sudden uncertainty about my future life?

The original work was not a good work, and the remake failed to make the story interesting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The movie is about a gold medal lawyer played by Zhang Xiaofei. After her daughter is kidnapped, she receives a mysterious phone call asking her to defend a criminal suspect. If she wins, her daughter will live, and if she loses, she will be killed. In order to save her daughter, she had no choice but to get involved, check the suspect&#39;s information, explore the life of the deceased woman, and then the entire case came to light. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no doubt that the choice of this subject was driven by female directors aiming at female stories. It’s a pity that we don’t see tenderness and empathy for female characters in the movie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Originally, the intertwining of light and dark aspects of human nature and the gaps between love and hate in interpersonal relationships are where the tension of the story lies, but in this film, these are all ignored. The director likes to focus the camera on the emotional reactions of the characters, making them gasp, cry, anxious, have tears in their eyes, or have gloomy eyes. They like to use slow motion to show the somatic characteristics of people in pain. However, as for the undercurrents beneath these waves, But he didn&#39;t care. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/c8e979e942e077ea8429669a3b1036ae.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;487&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/c8e979e942e077ea8429669a3b1036ae.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258040&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years There are a large number of female creators who constantly surprise us, such as Phoebe Waller-Bridge in &quot;Fleabag&quot; and Shao Yihui in &quot;The Myth of Love&quot;. They are all good at listening to the footsteps of their characters. Next, they bring their insight into the character&#39;s heart, their subtle description of desire, and their empathy for pain and separation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These perspectives are subtle and gentle, illuminating the hearts of the audience. Therefore, I am particularly looking forward to a female director remaking this story. Coupled with the constant positive reviews from the pre-release publicity, I expect her to be able to show the grief and indignation of a mother who is stunned, painful, resentful, regretful, and helpless, and finally goes to despair. This is a tragedy taking shape, and it also allows the audience to step on the edge of the protagonist&#39;s heart and resonate with her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unfortunately, the film did not record the footsteps of the tragedy. Without the sound of footsteps, the movie lacks the power to evoke emotions and thinking, just like a small cool drama mass-produced on a short video platform. However, it is also doubtful whether this film can really achieve the purpose of pleasing the audience like these low-cost, fast-produced dramas, because its pace is slow, and the twists are cliched and lack logic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/fc2bc6cfbeff05c167b9868cf15b736e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;492&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/fc2bc6cfbeff05c167b9868cf15b736e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258039&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And this The narrative completion that only stays at the visual excitement and superficial twists is almost a kind of surrender by the director: I can&#39;t understand the characters, I can&#39;t figure out the story, this is the only way I can go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don’t know whether this is the director’s lack of confidence in his own expressive ability, or his habit of shooting movies as short videos: plots that do not ask for logic, emotions that are not patiently laid out, all the effort is spent on Play with various camera moves and reversals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have heard more than one person complain that movies in recent years, including Hollywood blockbusters, have become more and more short videos. There is a group of people who no longer want to film real stories, abandon the core &quot;people&quot; of the story, and choose to fill the audience&#39;s stomach with potato chips, popcorn and Coke. Therefore, popular hot words, amplified emotions, and reversal techniques are their operating formulas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/8cc113799c717260831859c21a4d1fb7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;489&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/8cc113799c717260831859c21a4d1fb7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258042&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This trend There are of course practical factors behind it. For example, viewers who are anxious about survival have reduced mental strength, no longer have the ability to empathize with others, and only desire quick emotional satisfaction. The creators followed suit, and film and television fast-moving consumer goods became very popular. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, responsible creators will still try to pull the tired audience out of the small world and tell them that Coca-Cola potato chips cannot provide real nutrition, and they will ultimately not be able to fill the empty hearts of adults. We need to go into the broader story and identify the emotional antidote that suits us. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Writing this, I originally wanted to avoid discussing the family background of the director of this film, but when I thought about it, it had close to 10% of the film schedule at the beginning of its release, the promotion of a five-star rating, and Hui Yinghong, Actors like Zhang Xiaofei can&#39;t help but think of the words of supermodel Victoria Ceretti against Depp&#39;s daughter:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Please don&#39;t compare yourself to me.

When is a child contagious? Do I need infusion or &quot;lung washing&quot;? Worried about whether the hospital can be self-administered due to the large number of people in the hospital? On the occasion of World Pneumonia Day on November 12, the reporter interviewed relevant medical experts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“After being infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae, there is an incubation period of several days before the onset of fever, at which time the patient is contagious to a certain extent.” Zhou Wei, deputy chief physician of pediatrics at Peking University Third Hospital, said that wearing a mask can It can prevent infection to a certain extent, but it is not realistic for children to wear masks strictly and regularly. Going less often to crowded closed public places, ventilating the house frequently, regularly cleaning and disinfecting schools, and increasing outdoor activities are all helpful in preventing infection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is infusion the best treatment for mycoplasma pneumonia? Zhou Wei said that some parents believe that intravenous infusion is better than oral treatment, but in fact there is no such conclusion. Treatment should be selected based on the child&#39;s condition. Children with severe pneumonia can choose intravenous infusion, while most children with mild illness can be treated with oral medications. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the &quot;lung washing&quot; operation that parents are worried about, Zhou Wei said, &quot;This year, more children with mycoplasma pneumonia are indeed undergoing lung lavage treatment. Lung lavage has strict operating indications, such as patients with If the child develops atelectasis, local consolidation, or even very serious inflammatory reactions such as necrosis and sputum plug formation, lung lavage may need to be performed under a bronchoscope to unblock the airway, and it can also be seen under the microscope. To the extent of lung disease.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to mycoplasma, bacteria and viruses can also cause pneumonia. Ye Huan, director of the Respiratory Department of Beijing Chest Hospital, reminded that pneumonia patients often have typical symptoms such as fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, and young children and the elderly should pay special attention to precautions. It is recommended that people over 65 years old and children get the pneumonia vaccine. Although there is currently no vaccine against Mycoplasma pneumoniae, the pneumonia vaccine can prevent a variety of pneumococci. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Experts remind that for pneumonia caused by different pathogens, the medication choices are also different. For example, for mycoplasma pneumonia, penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics are ineffective, and macrolide antibiotics are the most commonly used. Patients who are suspected of being infected with pneumonia should seek medical treatment in a timely manner and receive targeted treatment after diagnosis, and avoid blind medication such as &quot;self-administration of antibiotics&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[为何总有体育馆塌顶：暴雪之下掩藏多少行业沉疴]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260478]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12 20:27:34&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 7, 2023, Yuecheng Stadium after the roof collapsed.

Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter Chen Yichen&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Within more than a hundred days, two stadium roof collapse accidents occurred in Qiqihar City and Jiamusi City, Heilongjiang Province, killing 11 and 3 people respectively, including 13 minors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 23, 2023, the night of the Qiqihar accident, Heilongjiang quickly organized and carried out safety inspections of various schools and public welfare sports venues. The main leaders of Jiamusi Huanan County went to Yuecheng Gymnasium the next day Observe on the spot. 105 days later, on November 6, Jiamusi ushered in the first snow before winter. In the gymnasium where the leaders had implemented safety production requirements, tragedy happened again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are not the only two cases of large-span roof collapse. Southern Weekend reporters found that there have been many steel structure roof collapse accidents in recent years: In April 2022, the roof of a swimming pool collapsed in Zhengzhou, Henan, causing 3 deaths and 9 injuries; in November 2021, the light steel structure roof of a project in Jinhua, Zhejiang collapsed, causing 6 deaths and 6 injuries; in March 2021, a grid roof collapsed at a construction site in Qingdao, Shandong, causing 1 death and 7 injuries; in May 2019, the roof of a steel structure building collapsed in Baise, Guangxi, causing 6 deaths and 87 injuries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not unique to China. Wang Luchuan (pseudonym), an expert in engineering accident research and former chief engineer of Beijing Urban Construction Group, told Southern Weekend reporters that roof collapse accidents of large-span structures are a common problem in buildings around the world. According to the cases he knows, stadium collapses have occurred in France, the United States, and Canada. ACCIDENT. “Currently there are relatively few cases of stadium collapse in China.” Wang Luchuan emphasized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many stadium roof collapse accidents point to the design form of fragile long-span steel structures. How did it change from a popular architectural style to the &quot;Sword of Damocles&quot; hanging above people&#39;s heads? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Reduce costs, reduce loads&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On November 6, 2023, netizens focused their attention on the roof of the Jiamusi stadium that collapsed just five years after it was built. According to Xinhua News Agency, The roof structure of the stadium is an H-shaped variable-section steel beam structure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Yonggang, chief engineer of Chengdu Southeast Steel Structure Co., Ltd., has 19 years of relevant experience. He told Southern Weekend reporters that this structure is called a portal steel frame structure in the industry, that is, doors made of H-shaped steel The structure can form a span of 20 to 30 meters, so there is no need to set up many columns. It is usually used in the design of small gymnasiums and factory buildings. &quot;The gymnasium in Jiamusi covers an area of ​​675 square meters, and the portal structure still matches the overall structure.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This structure itself has no problems, it is simple and simple, and it is a relatively mature structural system.” Liu Yonggang explained that the steel structure has good toughness and high strength, and it can be built like building blocks. It can be built quickly and achieve good architectural effects. &quot;It is excellent in itself, but if it is not used properly, problems will occur.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Yonggang introduced that the first step to make good use of steel structures is design, and the first step in design is selection. There are many structural forms that can meet the long-span function, such as portal structure, grid structure, truss structure, etc. Among them, the portal steel frame structure uses the least amount of steel, and its processing and installation technology is relatively simple, so it is also one of these three structures. The cheapest among the structures. The stadium that collapsed in Jiamusi this time was a portal structure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the type is selected, the next step is to calculate the load. Different load values ​​determine the amount of steel used and the compressive resistance of the building. In the Northeast region, in addition to the conventional wind loads, live loads, seismic loads, dust loads, etc. that need to be considered, the building design codes have additional provisions for the frequent heavy snow weather, that is, increasing the snow load. At the same time, in order to make it easier for snow to slide down, the roof slope is usually designed to be larger, but the increase in slope also means an increase in the cost. Photos of the interior of the Jiamusi Yuecheng Gymnasium circulated online show that the roof supported by H-shaped steel beams has a smaller slope, which means that the roof is easier to accumulate snow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether a building is designed safely is related to the designer’s personal expertise and experience, as well as the owner’s budget and requirements. Liu Yonggang introduced that designers from large design institutes will be more professionally persistent. For example, if they want to design a satisfactory and strong building, they will superimpose and evaluate all unfavorable factors, and then the designed plan will be relatively conservative, and the amount of steel used will naturally be higher. Increase. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For some owners who pursue maximizing profits and repaying their capital as soon as possible, &quot;obedient&quot; small design institutes are their first choice. &quot;Some owners are looking for costs. They will say, save me a little more, reduce the amount of steel used, and laymen will guide experts. Some small design institutes also want to survive, so they will try to figure out the load and meet the specifications. The limit.&quot; Liu Yonggang said. Yuecheng Gymnasium was designed by Jiamusi Architectural Design Institute. Liu Yonggang said that this design institute is a relatively small design institute. “It’s just that the design institute is small and it is not clear whether the design experience is sufficient.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The redundancy of this kind of stadium building design is too low. If you pile something on it, it will collapse. If you spend 100 yuan to keep it from collapsing, then you are willing to spend 101 Yuan, or are you willing to spend 200 Yuan?&quot; Wang Luchuan said frankly that he could understand, &quot;It is unlikely that the redundancy of such a long-span roof will be particularly high, so the cost will be too high. Like a bridge, an additional 10 % redundancy may increase the cost by 50%. But it cannot be given too low. It is really unjustifiable if it collapses in 5 years.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 7, 2023, the person in charge of Yuecheng Sports Club and others have been controlled by the police.

Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter Chen Yichen&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“People don’t know goods, money knows goods”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In fact, even having a perfect design plan does not guarantee the safety of the building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Ruoqiang, a professor at the School of Civil Engineering of Southeast University, wondered why a gymnasium that had just been built five years ago collapsed. &quot;The first five years are the best period for the house. It is impossible not to consider the snow load when designing. But if it collapses at this time, the problem is still quite big.&quot; He told Southern Weekend reporters that if there are no problems with the design drawings, then Is the construction quality strictly controlled: &quot;For example, does the purchased steel meet the strength requirements, is the construction section strictly in accordance with the drawing requirements, and is the weld quality qualified?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the industry situation, in the steel components Quality risks may also exist in the processing and manufacturing process. Liu Yonggang introduced that some small processing plants only have two or three machines and can invest hundreds of thousands of yuan to process, but they often do not have standardized management structures, quality management systems and safety production systems to control product quality. &quot;For example, after the factory buys the steel plate from the steel factory, it cuts it into pieces with a flame, and then welds it to form each steel component. During processing, if the hole is punched out of place, it needs to be cut larger with a flame. This will damage the steel and shorten its original service life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regular enterprises have a complete management system. Liu Yonggang took his own company as an example, &quot;When we buy steel plates, we need to detect and inspect them. After they are processed into steel components, we have to inspect them ourselves and ask a third party to inspect them before they can leave the factory.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On-site installation also requires attention to quality control. During the installation process, if the operation is not standardized, it will also cause quality defects and the designed service life will not be reached. &quot;Installation is equivalent to the final assembly of a car, which means bringing the processed steel components to the site for installation. It is best to have professionals do professional work.&quot; Liu Yonggang said that some irregular construction units bring a group of migrant workers to work, &quot; I was still farming yesterday, and I will install the steel structure tomorrow. If the accuracy of one place is not adjusted well, I will start the next step of installation, and it will be cut again and again, and errors will accumulate.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Optimization&quot; is also a common problem during the construction process. Feng Ruoqiang said that in order to make more money, a construction unit that won the bid &quot;optimized&quot; the design height of the steel beam from 600 mm to 400 mm and the wall thickness of the steel beam from 20 mm to 12 mm during construction. In order to save labor in the welding process, low-level welders are used to replace good welders with high wages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Yonggang believes that winning bids at low prices is the direct cause of the &quot;optimization&quot; trend in the industry. He found that the bidding prices of large companies are about 20% higher than that of small companies, mainly reflected in management costs, raw material costs and installation costs. “Our industry association also makes suggestions to the general contractor and the government, hoping that the price will not be lowered again and again. If the price is too low, if a small company does it, there will be problems such as &#39;optimization&#39;, cutting corners, etc., and ultimately it will be &#39;profitable&#39;.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it is difficult to change. &quot;The difficulty now is still money. In order to put into production as soon as possible, the owner requires you to rush for work hours and save costs. Including government investment, it is also reducing costs. As long as you don&#39;t choose the cheap one, you have made a mistake. People don&#39;t know the goods. , money knows the goods.&quot; Liu Yonggang sighed with emotion. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Don&#39;t kill yourself&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Sports venues designed and constructed in accordance with national standards cannot &quot;sit back and relax.&quot; In the specific use stage, safety mainly depends on the owner&#39;s consciousness, and there are no national mandatory standards. &quot;If a sports venue cannot be used correctly, it is prone to problems. During use, do not use it indiscriminately. People cannot go on the roof but you have to go up. There are no other loads on the roof but some additional loads are added.&quot; Many interviewed experts told Southern Weekend reporters The collapse of Qiqihar No. 34 Middle School Gymnasium was caused by more human factors. Its roof structure was called a bolted ball grid structure. Due to the illegal stacking of water-absorbing perlite, the load was excessive and suddenly collapsed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Qiqihar Stadium is a typical example of improper use.” Feng Ruoqiang believes that during the blizzard weather when the Yuecheng Stadium collapsed, “As an operator, you either close the stadium or pay extra attention. During the use phase Operators must have sufficient safety awareness, which is very important.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among building materials such as concrete, steel structures, and aluminum alloys, steel structures have a fatal weakness, which is its corrosion problem. It is more susceptible to oxidation. After oxidation, the performance of the material will be greatly reduced. Many collapse accidents are caused by corrosion of steel structures. Therefore, the maintenance of steel structure houses is very important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The steel structures we build need to be repainted every 10 to 15 years, and the bolts must be checked to see if they have fallen off. We will recommend that owners perform annual maintenance, or conduct major inspections every few years, and deal with problems as soon as possible if they are found. Liu Yonggang said, but now many steel structure buildings are difficult to maintain after they are repaired. &quot;Either it is covered by the suspended ceiling or wrapped in the wall, making it impossible to repair some places. If a rod is bent, it is difficult to notice. Some rods are force-bearing rods. If they are suddenly broken, the force will be distributed If the other members cannot bear it, they will suddenly collapse.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Ruoqiang visited many gymnasiums in a city in East China. Out of professional habit, he noticed that the steel structure roofs of some swimming pools were corroded. It&#39;s amazing, the paint is peeling off, but no one pays attention to this problem. Some poorly maintained badminton courts install heavy chandeliers and suspended ceilings on the roof for the convenience of playing, which will make the venue unsafe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an ordinary person, how can we judge whether the steel structure gymnasium we are in is safe? Liu Yonggang introduced the key points of observation: &quot;We mainly look at a few places, first to see how it transmits force. For example, the roof receives the load, and the roof transmits the force to the beams, the beams to the columns, and the columns to the supports and embedded parts. Etc. Therefore, we look at it from the other side, whether the column bolts have fallen off, whether the column has deformed, whether the column elevation has settled, and looking further up, whether the supports between beams have fallen off, whether the beams have deformed, whether the purlins have Is there any bend?” However, when these problems can be seen with the naked eye, it means there is an imminent safety risk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the collapse of the Qiqihar Stadium, Heilongjiang requested a comprehensive investigation of public welfare sports venues in the province; after the Jiamusi accident, the local government once again conducted a thorough investigation of long-span spatial structures including gymnasiums, requiring &quot;no discounts, Leave no blind spots and don’t go through the motions.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Ruoqiang believes that regular inspections by government departments are still necessary, but a solid inspection team must be formed. He suggested that the government could invite professionals in architecture and structure to &quot;focus on the inspection targets. First, check the stadiums with longer service life. If rust is found, apply anti-corrosion and anti-rust paint. Secondly, check the stadiums with lower design standards.&quot; Small and medium-sized gymnasiums”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Our construction in the past 20 to 30 years has been a bit too fast. Many times everyone is rushing for work. After the accident, we were also discussing that many steel structures have been repaired for more than 30 years. , especially some venues built in the early stage, should be maintained or demolished.&quot; Liu Yonggang said, &quot;The dividend period of our industry has also passed. In the remaining time, we need to think carefully about the development of this industry, and don&#39;t kill ourselves. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot; >;(Hui Ze also contributed to this article)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 20:55:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
