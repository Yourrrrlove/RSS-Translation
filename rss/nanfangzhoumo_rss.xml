It was widely circulated on the Internet and attracted great attention. Netizens were happy that the Xie family was finally reunited. And behind this, it is inseparable from the blessing of technological power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to media reports, the &quot;cross-age face comparison algorithm of relatives&quot; developed by a technology company was indispensable for the family reunion. Xie Qingshuai was only 3 months old when he was abducted, and his family only has photos of him when he was 3 months old. More than twenty years later, it is obviously an &quot;impossible task&quot; to use this baby photo to find someone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What makes the impossible possible is to use related faces to compare and find suspected objects. Taking the search for Xie Qingshuai as an example, photos of his biological parents and eldest brother were used to compare with the police&#39;s population database. This comparison is of course relatively vague and may result in multiple results, but it also greatly narrows the scope of the search, making it easier for the police to conduct precise comparisons through DNA testing and other technologies. In this comparison, Qing Shuai was found among the top five suspects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The “black technology” used to find abducted children, the most familiar to the public is DNA comparison technology. This technology was first used by the police to identify criminal suspects in major criminal cases. As the cost of testing and comparison decreases, the application of DNA technology is becoming more and more widespread, and it also plays a role in the final &quot;final decision&quot; to determine kinship in the fight against trafficking and finding relatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, DNA comparison also has great limitations, that is, samples from both parties are required for comparison. Parents searching for relatives will naturally take the initiative to submit their own blood samples to the police, but it is not that easy to obtain samples from abducted children. DNA information is one of the most sensitive biological information of an individual. Without sufficient evidence to suspect, the police cannot force anyone to submit their DNA sample at will. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many of the children’s data in the police anti-trafficking DNA database were submitted to the police by people who knew they had been trafficked, hoping to find their biological parents. Other data comes from trafficked persons rescued by the police during anti-trafficking operations. For those trafficked persons who do not know they are being trafficked and have not been noticed by the police, their DNA information will not appear in the anti-trafficking database and will not be found. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, the police have set up more than 3,000 free blood collection points across the country and publicized them widely, hoping that more people would volunteer to provide blood samples and increase the coverage of the anti-trafficking database. But the number of people who can be included in the DNA database is always limited. In the past, a common method used by families searching for relatives was “human flesh” search. They follow any possible clues and travel all over the country to find relatives all year round, spending time, energy and money. However, the results are very unsatisfactory and very few can actually find the abducted children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The application of high-tech means such as face comparison and recognition has greatly improved the efficiency of finding relatives. As early as 2019, the police began to use the cross-age facial recognition technology developed by Tencent, and successfully found a child who had been abducted for 10 years using a photo of the abducted child when he was 3 years old. But the technology at the time was not precise enough. According to his father, at that time, 100 suspected persons were found for each identification. The police usually selected the top 5 for DNA review, and the probability of missing a hit was very high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the advancement of computer vision and artificial intelligence technology, the accuracy of comparison is getting higher and higher. You can even compare using only photos of close relatives without having to take photos of the child himself. Because everyone has their ID card photo stored in the police database, using photos for identification greatly increases the scope of anti-trafficking comparisons, making it easier to find abducted children. The &quot;cross-age relative face comparison algorithm&quot; helped the police recover four abducted children in just six months, at least three of whom had been abducted for more than 20 years, which shows its ability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Advanced technology is used to fight abduction and find relatives, which is a good cause. Of course, it must be admitted that if used for evil, its destructive power will be huge. For example, a DNA paternity test may be used to forge paternity test certificates and settle the abducted children at the police station as their &quot;biological&quot; children. Of course, this is fraud, and it may also be said that it has little to do with technology. However, ubiquitous facial recognition is suspected of being abused in large quantities and may infringe on the privacy rights of ordinary people. Technologies such as AI face-changing may also be used in crimes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There used to be a saying on the Internet that &quot;where there are photos, there is the truth.&quot; But with the development of PS technology, photos can no longer represent the truth. Some people use face-swapping techniques to replace the avatars in pornographic photos and use them for blackmail. And with the advancement of video face-changing technology, it is no longer true that &quot;there is a video and there is the truth&quot;. The current AI technology can allow Trump to speak authentic Chinese, with flawless timbre and mouth shape, and it is no problem to fake other videos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Technology itself is neutral. Every black technology is a double-edged sword that can be used for good or for evil. Not only can technology itself be used for evil, but advanced technology can also be used to do evil. As soon as the high-tech cross-age face matching technology for finding relatives attracted attention, rumors of a &quot;paid version of the relative finding app&quot; appeared on the Internet. Families looking for relatives who are eager to find their own flesh and blood are easily deceived and defrauded of their money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Advanced technology contains huge power. How to use it, for good or evil, all depends on the thoughts of those who master the technology. Only by keeping technology in the hands of &quot;good people&quot; as much as possible, and with good systems for incentives and prevention, can technology be used to its fullest potential. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, as costs continue to fall, these new technologies will inevitably be available to more and more people, and the possibility of abuse and misuse will become greater and greater. How to prevent advanced technology from being used for evil as much as possible is also a serious issue that must be discussed. The &quot;Gongdou Drama&quot; of OpenAI, which developed ChatGPT some time ago, is related to the attitude towards AI technology to a certain extent. It can be seen that this is no longer a topic of unfounded worry, but an urgent one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[厦门警方通报2名老师涉嫌性侵大四女生]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261932]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-05 19:39:47&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;On the evening of December 4, 2023, “Many teachers from well-known middle schools in Xiamen assaulted and raped them while drunk.

Visual China | Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was sitting on a small round stool in the outdoor corridor. The stool was short, not very stable, and had no backrest. My feet, which had taken off my shoes, were stepping on a stained floor. I couldn’t walk around on the small carpet because I had to be ready to try on shoes at any time. Fortunately, it was October and I actually felt a cool breeze. Compared to four months ago (mid-June) when I came to order shoes, I was so sweaty that it was so comfortable. too much. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just sit down and sit down! It has been more than an hour, but it is still better than the shoemaker. It is hard enough to watch him open the soles of the shoes and close the uppers, nailing and hammering. So, although the custom-made shoes have nothing to do with the shape of my feet. They match each other, but they are a bit polar opposite, and they are incompatible with each other. Once the feet are put in, it is as painful as &quot;cutting off the feet to fit the shoes&quot;, but when I heard him repeatedly saying, &quot;It&#39;s okay, what&#39;s wrong with you? I&#39;ll do it for you, I&#39;ll do it for you.&quot; Done.&quot; I saw the enthusiasm and confidence on his face, while he was wandering around the studio filled with debris, looking for insoles and playing with shoe lasts. His movements were slow. He was not in a hurry. I How can you be anxious? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because I was bored sitting around, I could only look around. This is the upper floor of a factory building. There is a long row of rooms, one after another, facing a long gray corridor outside the door. , there was no one on the promenade, only the shoe store was open. If custom-made shoes hadn&#39;t come to my door, I believe I would never have come to this quiet area in the New Territories. It takes a taxi from where I live, and it costs hundreds of dollars for a round trip. However, because of a pair of feet with many problems, including hallux valgus, flat feet and fasciitis, I have been unable to find comfortable shoes for many years. , I can only hope that I will become Cinderella. One day, a pair of shoes made in heaven will suddenly appear. Once you put on a pair of shoes, you can walk or dance gracefully. If this is the case, then you will not care about anything. I immediately worked hard to pursue it without any expense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to relieve my worries, my elder brother in Toronto found information from the Internet. He said that there is a mysterious man in Hong Kong who specializes in custom-making shoes for people with special feet. All can be easily solved. This strange man is already very young and is about to retire, so he has to order his shoes quickly, otherwise he will regret it if he misses the opportunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For many years, if you want to buy shoes, you have to go to Japan to look for them. Maybe it’s because Japanese people often wear kimonos with flip-flops, so many people’s feet are not in the right shape; or maybe it’s because Japan’s national character is particularly careful. Thoughtful, anyway, if I want to find a decent pair of shoes that can fit on my feet, for me, Japan is the only place of origin. Due to the seriousness of the epidemic, I have not been able to go out for three or four years. My old shoes have been reimbursed and new shoes have not yet been obtained. When I heard that there is such a shoe-making wizard in Hong Kong, wouldn’t it make me excited and have to look for it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first time I came to make shoes was in mid-June. Finally, we found the reclusive master based on online information, and they actually connected via WhatsApp in a very modern way, and made an appointment to visit him on a Saturday morning. I called a taxi, drove around, walked a long way, arrived on time excitedly, walked into a completely unfamiliar factory building, stepped into a dirty and dilapidated elevator, rushed up to the high-rise building with great difficulty, and finally found the corresponding location. House number, why is the door locked and dark? I quickly called and contacted, and after a while, the other party finally answered, &quot;I&#39;m in the hospital! I injured my hand, and I&#39;m queuing up to see a doctor!&quot; Ah! Is this okay? Injured your hand while making shoes? Isn&#39;t this similar to a piano master suffering from tenosynovitis? This matter is no small matter! &quot;Ah! Take care of yourself! Your hands are the most important. When you are well, we will make an appointment again!&quot; On the phone, I was busy trying to comfort the person. Not only did I not blame the other person for breaking the appointment, I seemed to be full of apologies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a while, we met again. When Liu Bei paid three visits to the thatched cottage, he invited Zhuge Kongming, a great genius, to help. In this world, good things are hard to come by. How can it be so easy to achieve a wish? So, with all the fuss, we embarked on the journey for the second time. This time, I finally saw the master himself. To be honest, some traditional local handicrafts are gradually declining, such as hand-made umbrellas, hand-carved sparrows, hand-painted ceramics, hand-made bird cages, etc. The old craftsmen who make cheongsams and are skilled in embroidery or paper-making are also gradually declining. Therefore, seeing a craftsman who has been working hard for decades and sticking to his traditional position makes me feel particularly kind and respectful. The master is thin and frail, with a sincere smile on his face. He talks incessantly, just like a familiar neighbor. He tells you all kinds of stories as soon as he opens his mouth, and how big and small the feet of so and so are. Oops, but once you put on his shoes, the problem is solved; so and so went to Europe to immigrate, and they have to rush back to find him to make shoes, etc. After talking for a long time, I finally remembered that I wanted to do business, so I pulled out a piece of A4 white paper with a snap, asked the visitor to take off his shoes and socks, put his feet on the white paper, and asked him to draw a paper pattern with a pen, and then Write the customer&#39;s name and phone number next to it, and the registration procedure is completed. At that time, I thought to myself, why is it so simple? I have been to many shoe-making shops, and I have to constantly use computers and instruments to measure the shape of my feet, and even make models before I can customize them. The finished products made with high technology are often not ideal! Is this old master’s home-made steel-making method feasible? However, once I saw his confident look and his sincere words, I had no choice but to suppress the doubts in my heart, &quot;It&#39;s okay to try! Maybe a miracle will happen?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Pay a deposit of five hundred first. , the shoes are ready, pay another thousand yuan!&quot; Do you have a receipt? He said no, so he hurriedly offered them all, thinking that for the old-school craftsmen, everything depends on trust, not written evidence. He added, &quot;Everything is clear and well-founded. You don&#39;t have to worry.&quot; When will the shoes be ready? &quot;I only have one pair of hands. I have to do it every day, and I have to take turns! At least for a month or two. Don&#39;t rush me.&quot; &quot;Okay, don&#39;t rush me if you don&#39;t.&quot; It seems that he does not have an assistant or an apprentice. You have to be considerate of other people’s hard work! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I brought two pairs of Japanese shoes with me that day. They were trophies that I had purchased during my previous trip to Japan. Because the toe caps were too narrow, I had not worn them. I hope the master can help me with them this time. Making the toe of your shoes wider will be a great benefit. &quot;No problem, it&#39;s very easy!&quot; He agreed immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just like that, from June to October, I asked twice, and each time I was told that I was still in line. Finally, at the end of October, the shoes were actually ready! So I went there on a certain day, ready to receive the finished product. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I had no illusions and no hope, so when I put on my new shoes that day, a sharp pain hit me. I was not disappointed or resentful. This was to be expected! Of course, the master was not disappointed. He said confidently: &quot;It&#39;s like this. It&#39;s a little tight when I put it on. I&#39;ll do it for you. It&#39;ll be done soon.&quot; So he started to get busy. And me? I sat leisurely on the corridor, looking at the scenery on the hillside not far away, and started to enjoy it. I saw the windows of public houses hung with colorful clothes, commonly known as the Ten Thousand Flags. The green trees on the hillside were shaded, and the white clouds were floating in the blue sky. Suddenly, a group of white pigeons passed by in front of my eyes, and there was peace. It turns out that when waiting, choose to be optimistic. Being angry or calm only exists in a thought. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this time, I remembered that there were still two pairs of Japanese shoes to be retrieved, and asked the master to get the shoes. He said: &quot;Ah! My memory is not good, I can&#39;t remember where I put them! What are the shoes?&quot; How does it look like?&quot; He asked, smiling innocently, with an innocent look on his face, which suddenly reminded me of the launch of the &quot;Brain Care&quot; program of CUHK by Kao Kun, which had to deal with the problem of memory degradation in the elderly. Have sympathy! Then, he said, why not let your Filipino maid go into the studio and look for it yourself? That place is really weird. It&#39;s more like a landfill than a studio. It&#39;s filled with all kinds of materials and tools, leaving only a narrow path that can be walked sideways. To find the target in it, it should be better than a lost city. Treasure hunting is even harder! The Filipino maid tried her best to go around in a circle but came back in vain. When she got to the door, she looked at me and the two of them couldn&#39;t help laughing! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here, the master took the trouble to adjust it again and again, and the shoes became looser every time. Every few minutes, I had to test it, standing up and sitting down. So on, after more than a dozen rounds, although the shoes and the foot shape have never reconciled, I think it is time to call it a day and call it a day. &quot;The leather of these shoes is very soft. If you wear them for a few more days, it won&#39;t hurt anymore.&quot; In your life, when buying and making shoes, have you never heard this kind of advice? I smiled, nodded quickly, paid the balance in a hurry, and prepared to go home. Suddenly, the master announced to me: &quot;If you find your Japanese shoes, I will send them to you by SF Express. You don&#39;t have to pay the ten yuan fee, I will pay it!&quot; He said it with great style, Very generous! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the way back, I calculated in my mind that those two pairs of Japanese shoes cost me several thousand. Three visits to the thatched cottage, the fare plus the shoes cost another several thousand. If I add in the worries, wouldn’t it be Not even worth it? It is better to be happy and relieved. If one day I find the shoes, I will treat them as foreigners and be overjoyed. If they really come to nothing, then won’t that be another grand reason to visit Japan? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 19:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一起“非典型”涉黑案：曾因律师手机法庭被扣陷舆论风暴]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261925]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-05 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 6, 2023, the defense lawyer Chi Susheng in this case caused a conflict because his mobile phone was detained.

The case has gone through three stages: first instance, second instance, and retrial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The first instance of the original trial determined that the case did not constitute a crime of a gangland nature, and the second instance court remanded the case for a retrial on the grounds that some facts were unclear. However, the public prosecution still insisted on charging the suspect with gang-related crimes, and added new charges and criminal facts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 9, 2023, the Xuanwei City Court opened a new trial, which has lasted for a month and a half and has not yet ended. During this period, the court hearings attracted public attention several times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The incident with the widest impact is the seizure of lawyers’ cell phones. On November 6, 2023, Chi Susheng, the defender of the third defendant Li Zhengyan in the case, was ordered to withhold his mobile phone by the presiding judge, which caused a conflict in the court. This unexpected incident ended with Chi Susheng being sent to the hospital for emergency treatment and Xuanwei City Court. The dean apologized to Chi Susheng and returned the mobile phone. After that, Chi Susheng went out to recuperate and did not participate in the subsequent defense. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Three cases merged&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Shunping&#39;s involvement in gangs originated from the arrest of Zhang Jian, the gang leader in Xuanwei City. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On January 13, 2019, the Xuanwei City Public Security Bureau controlled a large number of members of the gang headed by Zhang Jian while promoting the special campaign against gangs and evil. Later, Zhang Jian was sentenced to suspended death. There were more than 90 defendants in the &quot;Zhang Jian case&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Three months after Zhang Jian was controlled, on April 12, 2019, Liu Shunping was controlled by the Xuanwei City Public Security Bureau on suspicion of committing extortion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Shunping was born in Longtan Town, Xuanwei City in 1977. Xu Jinde, a veteran employee of his company, introduced that Liu Shunping joined the army after graduating from junior high school and returned to Longtan Town to work as a joint security guard after his discharge. While working in the joint defense team, Liu Shunping discovered business opportunities in coal transportation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Public information shows that the coal fields in Xuanwei are vast and rich in coal reserves, with proven and predicted reserves reaching 2.178 billion tons, making it the largest coal resource in Yunnan Province. One of the rich areas. Among them, the coal mine reserves in Longtan Town are about 100 million tons, and there are 12 developed large and small coal mines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the late 1990s, Liu Shunping borrowed money from relatives and friends to start a coal transportation business and earned his first pot of gold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Shunping&#39;s brother-in-law Jin Huaiying told Southern Weekend reporters that Liu Shunping bid for the Cide Coal Mine from the Longtan Town Government in 2004 and applied for a mining license. The mining license is valid for 10 years. Two or three years later, Liu Shunping bought Fangmaping Coal Mine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Jin Huaiying was the director of Cide Coal Mine. He introduced that as the operations of the two coal mines gradually got on track, Liu Shunping also accumulated a certain amount of wealth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;While operating a coal mine in Longtan Town, Liu Shunping met Zhang Jian, the local evil leader in Xuanwei. The first-instance judgment of the &quot;Zhang Jian case&quot; shows that Zhang Jian was born on March 6, 1978 in Tianba Town, Xuanwei City. He was involved in society in his early years and became somewhat famous in the local area. Later, he gradually developed into one of the major evil forces in Xuanwei. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Many people in society don&#39;t understand how a private enterprise owner could associate with a gangster boss.&quot; Jin Huaiying explained that the social environment at that time was quite special, &quot;He The two didn&#39;t know each other before. Zhang Jian celebrated his birthday twice a year, and every time he invited the boss of Xuanwei&#39;s business. Everyone went, how dare Liu Shunping not go?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align : left;&quot;>;Relevant evidence and materials show that the &quot;1.5&quot; task force established by the Qujing Municipal Public Security Bureau in response to the &quot;Zhang Jian case&quot; took control of Liu Shunping during the handling of the case, and took control of his brother Liu Shunfu on the same day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Indictment No. 310 of the Second Propaganda and Inspection Department (2020) shows that during the investigation process, the Qujing Municipal Public Security Bureau established another investigation against Liu Shunfu, Zhang Qiang, and Tao Yunrui. , Shan Qingze, Shan Qingman, Xu Wanquan, Guan Yuan, Li Jixiong and other eight evil forces criminal group &quot;4·11&quot; task force. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The public security organs also captured Li Zhengyan while handling the &quot;Zhang Jian case&quot;. Li Zhengyan is a key figure in connecting the &quot;Zhang Jian case&quot; and the &quot;Liu Shunping brothers case&quot;. Among the criminal facts listed in the verdict of Zhang Jian&#39;s case, in 2011, Li Zhengyan conspired with Zhang Jian, Liu Shunping, and Liu Shunfu to extort a local coal mine owner, making illegal profits of more than 6.7 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since October 2019, the Qujing Municipal Public Security Bureau has successively investigated the cases of Liu Shunfu and other eight people and Li Zhengyan on suspicion of extortion. Liu Shunping is suspected of organizing and leading a gangland organization.

The incident originated from the analysis video uploaded by the blogger &quot;Wheatfield Farmer&quot;. He used software to analyze the 12 song videos taken by fans at the Mayday Shanghai concert on November 16. After extracting the vocal analysis, he accused Mayday of &quot;in 12 songs. &quot;Five of the songs are lip-syncing,&quot; and another one is &quot;the first few lines are fake, but the rest are true.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident fermented, it triggered reactions from all parties. Some music bloggers said they had reported it to the China Consumers Association; the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture and Tourism said it would require the organizers to cooperate with the investigation; staff of the China Performance Industry Association said they had paid attention to the matter and were &quot;waiting for the results of the cultural law enforcement department.&quot; Mayday officials first posted on Weibo that they would broadcast the entire Paris concert live online, which was interpreted by the outside world as &quot;to dispel doubts.&quot; On December 4, their agency also issued a &quot;solemn statement&quot; stating that &quot;the tour will There is no lip-synching behavior in it.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to media reports, the audio and video materials of the Mayday Shanghai concert have been submitted to the local cultural market inspection department. The relevant departments will conduct scientific evaluation and analysis and publish the investigation results. Regardless of whether Mayday &quot;lip-synced&quot; this time, the old topic of &quot;lip-syncing&quot; has been thrown back into the public opinion field, which deserves further analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, this incident has brought new problems to &quot;how to define lip-synching&quot;, which requires industry research and follow-up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Article 31 of the &quot;Implementing Rules of the Commercial Performance Management Regulations&quot;, lip-synching &quot;refers to the act of actors using pre-recorded songs and music instead of live singing during the performance.&quot; In this incident, judging from the blogger&#39;s accusation, Mayday&#39;s suspected lip-synching was not the simple and crude &quot;pre-recording&quot; in the past, but the method of &quot;back-up singing&quot;: importing instrumental music and music into the concert project file in advance. For the vocal track, &quot;the lower part of the verse is really sung, and the chorus is sung in the background.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If &quot;undersinging&quot; is true, then the definition of &quot;lip-syncing&quot; will have a new question: Does &quot;singing the main song really, singing under the chorus&quot; count as lip-synching? In other words, what percentage of a song must be performed live for it to be considered lip-synching? Furthermore, today, when artificial intelligence has developed to the point where it is difficult to distinguish authenticity from fake, if the AI ​​training voice in the future is &quot;promoted and applied&quot;, how should the industry define and prevent it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Regulations on the Administration of Commercial Performances&quot; stipulates that &quot;actors may not deceive the audience by lip-synching, and performance organizers shall not organize actors to lip-sync. No unit or individual may provide conditions for lip-synching.&quot; In fact, fake The turmoil caused by lip-synching did not start today. Similar incidents are common, and many singers have become the butt of jokes because of their genuine lip-synching. The reason is simple. Even without the constraints of the Commercial Performance Management Regulations, lip-syncing by entertainers will harm their social reputation. Lip-synching at a concert is unjustifiable in terms of professional ethics and legal responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since Mayday’s agency has issued a statement categorically denying lip-syncing and accusing the relevant remarks of “malicious attacks and rumors and slander”, one of the two statements must be false, and one party is destined to be suspected of violating relevant laws and regulations. This matter also deserves an authoritative investigation result. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the &quot;Regulations on the Administration of Commercial Performances&quot; stipulates that &quot;the performance organizer should send a dedicated person to supervise the performance to prevent the occurrence of lip-synching behavior.&quot; According to a staff member of the Beijing Cultural Market Law Enforcement Corps, Mayday this year Law enforcement officers were on site to supervise the six concerts in Beijing. It is worth asking whether Mayday’s suspected lip-synching was only in Shanghai this time? At the previous six concerts in Beijing, did the on-site law enforcement officers fulfill their responsibilities of &quot;supervising the performances&quot; to prevent lip-synching? This should all be clarified in subsequent investigations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, this incident also raises a question: how to define and protect the consumer rights of commercial performance audiences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If Mayday’s lip-synching is true, some viewers’ demands for “refund,” “compensation,” and “apology” should be supported. Of course, there are many viewers who &quot;don&#39;t care whether they actually sing or not&quot;, and there are also many fans who regard the concert as a ticket to a meet-and-greet. After the Mayday suspected lip-synching incident, some fans also said that &quot;just feel the atmosphere of the scene&quot;, &quot;just seeing them is enough&quot; and &quot;it doesn&#39;t matter whether they lip-sync or do the real thing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a famous saying in the legal world: &quot;struggle for rights.&quot; Any right needs to be asserted before it can be implemented. It is not difficult to imagine that there are people in the audience who are serious about lip-synching, and there are also people who don&#39;t care about lip-synching. There are people in the audience who have &quot;high standards and strict requirements&quot; for the viewing experience, and there are also people who bought tickets and came in just to have fun. In reality, &quot;concert audiences&quot; are not a homogeneous group, and their expectations for &quot;quality of goods and services&quot; are also different. However, since there are audiences claiming their rights in accordance with the law and regulations, the performers should respect their demands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, there are a lot of lip-syncing in the European and American music circles. For example, in concerts later in his acting career, Michael Jackson would choose to lip-sync when singing and dancing some dance numbers due to physical reasons, but he The city will state in advance on its official website that the audiences who come for the &quot;moonwalk&quot; are not interested in whether they really sing or not; Pavarotti also lip-synched at the opening ceremony of the Turin Winter Olympics, but a generation of tenors can perform powerfully. He has won the admiration and respect of the world for showing up despite his illness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Chinese music scene, &quot;lowering expectations&quot; and &quot;advance notification&quot; are also widely used methods in the industry. For example, some singers lower the key or change the song in order to ensure the true singing effect. This is a frank admission of the voice. I can no longer really sing. In this case, it may be possible to respect the independent management rights of entertainers and require them to fulfill their obligation to inform, not to sell dogs on sheep&#39;s head, and let the market judge and consumers make their choices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, in the face of the controversy over Mayday’s suspected lip-syncing, the industry must define “lip-syncing” more accurately, regulate commercial performances with more detailed legislation and law enforcement, and at the same time In accordance with the Consumer Rights and Interests Protection Act, we protect consumers’ rights to know the truth, make independent choices and fair transactions, and respect the legitimate rights and interests of consumers who come forward to question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 17:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[湖南一县委书记在下乡调研返程途中坠江身亡]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261911]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-05 15:57:45&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On the afternoon of December 5, the Hunan Rucheng County Party Committee Office issued a notice stating that the deputy director of the Chenzhou Municipal People’s Congress Standing Committee, Comrade Huang Siping, secretary of the Rucheng County Party Committee, died of an accident at 15:31 on December 4 on his way back from a field trip to the countryside.

The Heihe River originates from Qinghai, and Zhangye City is located in the middle reaches. It contains more than 90% of the cultivated land and population in the basin, and more than 80% of the water consumption and GDP. Lushui Bay is known as Zhangye&#39;s &quot;humidifier&quot;, but if too much water is intercepted, it may affect downstream water use. The Ejina Banner of Alxa League in Inner Mongolia in the lower reaches of the Heihe River is one of the origins of sandstorms in the north. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhangye, located in the Hexi Corridor, is located at the intersection of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the Inner Mongolia Plateau. It is a natural oasis on the Silk Road. The &quot;gold&quot; in the ancient name &quot;Jin Zhangye&quot; not only reflects the wealth of this place, but also shows that in this arid zone oasis, water resources are as precious as gold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Including Lushuiwan Scenic Area, the inspection report showed that there are more than 30 artificial water surfaces in Zhangye City with illegal and illegal problems, with a total water area of ​​more than 6,000 acres. These artificial water surfaces, which have only appeared in the past ten years, also carry expectations for the transformation and upgrading of Zhangye&#39;s cultural tourism industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Zhangye City was designated as my country&#39;s first water-saving society pilot area by the Ministry of Water Resources as early as 2002, and has made many water-saving explorations. However, this time the Central Ecological and Environmental Protection Inspectorate not only reported that Zhangye illegally extracted surface water, but also failed to control over-exploitation of groundwater. &quot;Zhangye City has not implemented the strictest water resources management system in place. Economic development and urban construction have not fully considered the water environment carrying capacity of the Heihe River Basin. The problem of inaction and random actions by some departments is outstanding.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;1,248 acres of artificial The water is involved in &quot;building before approval&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Zhangye Ganzhou is known as &quot;half city of reeds, half city of pagoda shadows&quot;. The name &quot;Lushui Bay&quot; may place its hope on recreating its historical features. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with famous scenic spots such as Zhangye Danxia National Geopark, Lushui Bay is a new attraction. Before 2009, there was no open water landscape here, but rocky beaches, sand pits, stone quarries, and construction waste dumps, all of which were inaccessible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking from the map, the Lushuiwan Scenic Area is connected by three artificial lakes. To the northeast is the Zhangye National Wetland Park, which was built at the same time. The two together form the Lushuiwan Tourist Resort. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/9fe1fabd75.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/9fe1fabd75.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260736&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;Zhangye National Wetland Park.

Song Xiaoyu, associate researcher at the Northwest Institute of Ecological Environment and Resources, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and others have made calculations. In 2011, the average selling price of commercial housing within a 500-meter radius of Zhangye National Wetland Park was 3,232 yuan/square meter, rising to 4,147 yuan/square meter in 2021. square meter, excluding factors such as inflation and infrastructure construction, the landscape value premium of the wetland park is 715 yuan/square meter, and the total added value of the landscape reaches 32 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/9fed4194bd.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/9fed4194bd.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260737&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;Zhangye National Wetland Park. Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Lin Fangzhou&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“In the past, there was a rock and sand quarry, and today we are an ecologically happy river.” The transformation of Lushui Bay has been promoted as a positive and typical case of ecological and environmental governance. However, as the core landscape in the Lushui Bay Scenic Area, the artificial water surface was notified by the inspection team as being built before approval. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the staff of Zhangye Water Affairs Bureau, the preliminary procedures involved in the artificial lake include: project approval, construction project land pre-examination opinion, environmental impact report approval, water resources demonstration report approval, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Inspection team members said that almost none of these procedures were completed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person familiar with the Zhangye Municipal Government told Southern Weekend reporters that the Lushui Bay Scenic Area project did not have a project approval from the development and reform department, and there was no environmental impact assessment of the construction project. &quot;The project approval is a birth certificate, otherwise it is &#39; Black households&#39;&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Lushuiwan Scenic Area, which was built 12 years ago, has not gone through the relevant procedures, which is incredible. “Lushui Bay is so good that everyone is used to it,” said the above-mentioned person familiar with the situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The artificial water surfaces built before approval in Zhangye are not an isolated case. They also include 11 artificial water surfaces in the Olympic Forest Park (referred to as Orson Park) across the river from Lushui Bay, totaling 1,248 acres. Since the country strengthened the investigation and rectification of &quot;lake digging and landscaping&quot; in June 2020, two artificial lakes have been newly built in Zhangye Ruoshui Park, with a water area of ​​165 acres; the newly built artificial lakes in Baita Rainbow Park and the park on the west side of Zhangye Grand Theater have It also occupied 24.4 acres of cultivated land. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Mine pit turned into park, lack of ecological restoration plan&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Among the artificial water surfaces reported by the inspector, the water intake area of ​​Zhangye Aosen Park is second only to the artificial lake in Lushui Bay Scenic Area, equivalent to half of the latter. Its story is also similar to Lushui Bay: restoration-planting trees-water diversion-development-development of tourism + real estate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before 2017, the original site of Aosen Park was a deserted Gobi desert with no grass growing on it. There were many large pits left by sand and gravel mining in the sand and gravel factory. The relevant person in charge of the Zhangye Water Conservancy Bureau responded to Southern Weekend Reporters, diverting water from the Heihe River to build artificial water surfaces is an ecological restoration method that “kills two birds with one stone”: the mine pits are treated to prevent seepage and then filled with water, which is low-cost; the water storage can also provide water sources for the surrounding forests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/a36244a7a3.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/a36244a7a3.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260738&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;Zhangye Olympic Forest Park.

According to its plan, it attempts to create an ecological leisure and health gathering area integrating tourism, health care, sports and entertainment. Aosen Park not only plans to build distribution plazas, sports fields and parking lots, but also supports Shenkeng Hotel, Heihe Water Ecology Museum, Forest Health Care Community, Forest Sports Town, etc. The investment is estimated to reach 2.86 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Inspection team members believe that these mines should develop tailor-made ecological restoration plans in accordance with relevant national management regulations and scientifically demonstrate their ecological impact. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the person in charge of the Ganzhou District Heihe Forestry Farm, the unit responsible for the Osun Park project, said frankly that how to repair the more than 40 mine pits, whether to cover them with soil and then plant grass and trees, or to prevent seepage and then fill them with water , and no ecological restoration plan has been carried out independently. Finally, depending on factors such as the topography of the mine pit, some cover the area with soil and then plant trees, while others do anti-seepage and then inject water. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Why not apply for a water abstraction permit? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Open the satellite map on your mobile phone. The green Zhangye is surrounded by the yellow Gobi Desert. Pieces of agate-like blue water are embedded in the territory of Zhangye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhangye is not rich in water resources. Zhangye has a temperate arid climate, with annual precipitation of only 100-250 mm, but annual evaporation as high as 1400-2700 mm. These artificial water surfaces are created mainly from the Heihe River flowing through Zhangye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/2dd96aa896.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;553&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/2dd96aa896.png&quot; data-key=&quot;260739&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;The artificial water surface in the Lushui Bay Scenic Area contrasts sharply with the dry Heihe River bed next to it.

The water in the main canals has obtained a water abstraction permit. The water consumption of the artificial water surface in Lushui Bay is increased by the main canals. The water consumption for agricultural irrigation does not exceed the total water permit. However, members of the inspection team said that the permitted use of water in the main canal is limited to agricultural irrigation, and the artificial water surface in the Lushui Bay Scenic Area is ecological water and does not comply with the water intake permit regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only does Lushui Bay Scenic Area not have a water permit. The inspector reported that Zhangye Ruoshui Huahai Scenic Area has not applied for a water abstraction license from 2016 to 2021. After applying for a new license in 2022, it still drew an excess of 67,000 cubic meters of water from the Heihe River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/3580c4d48a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/3580c4d48a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260740&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;Zhangye Ruoshuihuahai Scenic Area.

According to the Heihe River water diversion plan determined by the State Council in 1997, about 60% of the water volume was released downstream. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The relevant person in charge of the Zhangye Water Affairs Bureau said that since August 2000, Zhangye City has continuously completed the water diversion tasks from the Heihe River. Especially in 2023, the precipitation will be 20% less than in previous years, and the annual runoff will be dry. However, The discharge task has still been exceeded, and the downstream Dongjuyan Sea has not dried up since 2004. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, relevant people believe that Zhangye’s arid climate, high evaporation, and illegal construction of artificial water surfaces in the city have exacerbated water shortages. The performance may not be obvious during the wet season, but in recent years the Heihe River runoff has been relatively dry, which has already revealed ecological risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/e391ba7df0.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;551&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/e391ba7df0.png&quot; data-key=&quot;260741&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;The artificial water surface in the Lushui Bay Scenic Area contrasts sharply with the dry Heihe River bed next to it.

Song Xiaoyu said that according to data from the Yingluoxia Hydrological Station in the upper reaches of the Heihe River, the multi-year average runoff entering the middle reaches is about 1.58 billion cubic meters. The average annual runoff from 2005 to 2020 exceeded 2 billion cubic meters, reaching a peak of 23.5 in 2017. One hundred million cubic meters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ejina Banner in the lower reaches of the Heihe River feels the greatest changes in water volume. According to &quot;Ban Yue Tan&quot;, from 2016 to 2020, the number of days when rivers in Ejina Banner were closed was reduced from the previous average of 250 days to 55 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the runoff of the Heihe River has decreased in recent years. According to the Gansu Provincial Hydrological Station, the runoff during the 2023 dispatch period is only 1.38 billion cubic meters, less than 60% of the peak. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past three years, the Ejina oasis ecology, which has already improved, has begun to &quot;cry thirsty&quot; again. Data provided by the Alxa League Water Conservancy Bureau to &quot;Half Moon Talk&quot; shows: Since 2020, the Ejina in the Heihe River Basin has The number of flow-free days in this section has been around 100 for three consecutive years. On May 20, 2022, the entire Ejina section of the Heihe River Basin was cut off. The East Juyan Sea has not received water supply for more than 10 months. Many lakes and wetlands have dried up one after another.

Visual China/Photo&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Ineffective management of groundwater overexploitation&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The annual runoff of the Heihe River is relatively low, which is also reflected in Zhangye&#39;s groundwater level data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The inspector reported that the groundwater level in Zhangye City continues to decline due to overexploitation of groundwater. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to data from the notification mechanism for water level changes in groundwater overexploitation areas established by the Ministry of Water Resources and the Ministry of Natural Resources, the groundwater level in Zhangye City has dropped year-on-year in almost every quarter from 2020 to 2023. For example, in the first three quarters of 2023, respectively Year-on-year decreases of 0.39, 0.26, and 0.81 meters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historically, due to long-term large-scale extraction of groundwater, Zhangye City has formed 7 over-exploitation areas, all of which are restricted mining areas. The &quot;Groundwater Management Regulations&quot; stipulate that the provincial water conservancy department, in conjunction with the natural resources and other departments, organizes the delineation of groundwater prohibited and restricted areas within the administrative region. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The inspector also reported that since 2020, thousands of excessive water withdrawal problems have occurred in Zhangye&#39;s over-mining area, and the local water affairs department has basically failed to investigate and deal with them in accordance with the law. In the restricted mining area, 160 million cubic meters of groundwater was used beyond the permitted limit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an interview with a Southern Weekend reporter, the relevant person in charge of the Zhangye City Water Affairs Bureau said that although some water wells drew more groundwater than allowed, other wells drew less water than allowed, and the total amount of groundwater drawn in the region was not. Exceeds total permitted range. The reason why there are no administrative penalties for thousands of excessive water withdrawals is because the local government implements a tiered water price mechanism. After exceeding the permitted water use, higher water fees can be charged and adjusted through market mechanisms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, relevant analysts believe that this move is suspected of &quot;selling water&quot; and is not conducive to the management of groundwater overexploitation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2012, the State Council&#39;s &quot;Opinions on Implementing the Strict Water Resources Management System&quot; required that &quot;in areas where groundwater is over-exploited, new withdrawals of groundwater from agriculture, industrial construction projects and service industries are prohibited.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The inspector reported that since 2016, the local water department has illegally approved 20 wells including Zhiyuan Forestry Technology Co., Ltd. In January 2016, the Gansu Provincial Department of Water Resources required that all self-provided water wells within the coverage of the public water supply network be closed in 2016. Not only did Zhangye City fail to implement the relevant requirements, it even issued water abstraction licenses for 49 wells of enterprises in the Economic Development Zone. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters noticed that the groundwater data provided by the relevant authorities in Zhangye City are confusing and contradictory. The 2015 groundwater water consumption data provided by the Municipal Water Affairs Bureau to the inspection team differed by more than 46 million cubic meters from the data provided to reporters. Southern Weekend reporters asked the Municipal Water Affairs Bureau for the reason, but as of press time, no reply has been received. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The inspector stated that this was not an isolated case. During the inspection process, due to the prominent cases of misreporting, concealment and false reporting by relevant competent authorities, the workload of on-site verification was greatly increased. For example, the inspection team reviewed the list of self-provided water wells covered by Zhangye City’s public water supply pipe network. The Municipal Water Affairs Bureau only provided a list of Ganzhou District, including the water wells of three companies. However, the inspection team went to the Economic Development Zone in Ganzhou District for on-site inspection and found that there were 49 water wells in dozens of companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Water conservation requires institutional reform&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In winter, the Heihe River enters the dry season. When driving on the Zhangye Heihe River Bridge, the river bed under the bridge has dried up, exposing yellow soil and gray sand and gravel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/3196d705e1.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/3196d705e1.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260743&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;At the end of November 2023, in the Zhangye Heihe River section in winter, some rivers had dried up. Photo by Southern Weekend Lin Fangzhou&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The per capita water resource in Zhangye City is only 1,250 cubic meters, which is 60% of the national average. As a large agricultural city, the average water quantity per mu is only 511 cubic meters, which is only 60% of the national average. Thirty percent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhangye’s water resource shortage is inseparable from its economic structure. In 2022, Zhangye&#39;s three industrial structure ratios will be 29.3:20.4:50.3, with agriculture accounting for a larger proportion of the economy than industry. Agricultural water accounts for about 90% of the city’s water use. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thanks to climatic advantages such as long sunshine hours and large temperature differences between day and night, Zhangye is rich in high-quality agricultural products. The &quot;Wujiang tribute rice&quot;, which has been famous since the Tang Dynasty because the rice grains do not stick together after being cooked, has been significantly reduced due to the water-saving rice planting area. On the large tracts of farmland near Lushuiwan Scenic Area and Aosen Park, billboards proclaiming &quot;100,000 acres of vegetable base for Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao&quot; were erected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The seasonal distribution of water resources in the Heihe River is uneven, and the timing of incoming water and agricultural water use is not completely coordinated. Song Xiaoyu told Southern Weekend reporters that the Heihe River water resources come from glaciers, frozen soil, snowmelt water and rainfall. The precipitation is mainly concentrated from July to September, and from March to June when agricultural water is most urgent, 60 to 70% The water needs to be supplied by glaciers, frozen soil, and melted snow. Winter snowfall and snow contribute 20%-25% of the water source to the Heihe River runoff in the second year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song Xiaoyu said that Zhangye, located in high latitudes and high altitudes, is a sensitive area greatly affected by climate change. The temperature is increasing at a faster rate. The glacier area has decreased by about 20% in the past 50 years, and the snow line is also rising. From October to December 2022, the snowfall in Shandan, Minle and Sunan counties in Zhangye was 70% less than the average of the past ten years. The decrease in surface runoff has also led to an increase in groundwater withdrawals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under such economic, social and climatic conditions, Zhangye urgently needs to further improve water resource utilization. Song Xiaoyu believes that Zhangye City has gone through long-term exploration of water conservation work, and the current irrigation efficiency is already at a high level. The next step is to make breakthroughs in institutional mechanisms, such as further deepening the reform of agricultural water rights and water prices, improving the water rights trading system, and continuing to promote High-standard farmland construction, accelerating industrial structure adjustment, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song Xiaoyu and others have conducted research on Ganzhou District of Zhangye City and found that optimizing the water rights allocation model, high-standard farmland construction and industrial structure adjustment can respectively increase the comprehensive carrying capacity of water resources by up to 1.87%. , 8.72% and 3.06%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“For local authorities, institutional reform faces many challenges such as funding, technology, and talent. However, in order to continue to optimize water resource management and improve water resource utilization efficiency, this work is imperative. .&quot; Song Xiaoyu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 15:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[裁判文书里出现“安徽省南京市”？深圳福田法院通报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261903]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-05 15:05:01&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Situation Report&lt;br>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, some media pointed out Our court has corrected the misstatement of &quot;Nanjing City, Anhui Province&quot; in the enforcement ruling.

The &quot;Notice&quot; focuses on six aspects of work requirements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;First, attach great importance to the common prevention of multiple diseases. &lt;/strong>;Fully understand the current work situation and significance of epidemic prevention and control in winter, adhere to bottom-line thinking and common prevention of multiple diseases, and respond to the possible overlapping epidemic periods and alternating epidemic peaks of multiple epidemic diseases, Make scientific and effective responses according to the time and situation, and solidly implement various prevention and control measures to protect the lives, health and safety of teachers and students to the greatest extent possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The second is to strengthen monitoring and early warning intervention. &lt;/strong>;Strengthen the construction of the epidemic monitoring system, focusing on the implementation of morning and afternoon inspection systems for primary and secondary schools and kindergartens, infectious disease epidemic reporting systems, and tracking and registration systems for absences due to illness. Regarding the incidence of respiratory infectious diseases in local schools, proactively consult with the health and disease control departments to strengthen information exchange, collaboratively carry out risk analysis and prediction and early warning, and guide schools to achieve scientific and accurate responses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The third is to strengthen daily health education. &lt;/strong>;Carry out full-coverage, multi-form publicity on prevention and control knowledge of COVID-19 infection and other winter epidemic diseases. Teachers and students should be guided to deepen the concept of &quot;everyone is the first person responsible for their own health&quot;, wear masks scientifically, wash hands frequently, ventilate frequently, pay attention to cough etiquette, participate in appropriate exercises, and improve health literacy and self-protection capabilities. Strengthen family epidemic prevention guidance, and cooperate with relevant departments to promote and guide children and adolescents on influenza, pneumococcal and other vaccinations. Instruct teachers and students with symptoms such as fever and cough to take protective measures, seek medical treatment promptly, standardize treatment, use medicine scientifically, and attend school without illness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The fourth is to strengthen services for sick students. &lt;/strong>;We will improve the response plan, ensure an orderly connection between online and offline teaching, and guide students who are absent from school due to illness to use rich online teaching resources to study at home. There are no strict requirements for students’ homework during their illness. Based on the characteristics of the course of respiratory diseases, parents are guided to allow sick students to receive adequate treatment and rest, and to make practical and scientific arrangements for returning to school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The fifth is to provide material support. &lt;/strong>;Work with the health and disease control departments to scientifically predict possible epidemics, dynamically adjust epidemic prevention material reserves, ensure the supply of medical and daily supplies, and improve the level of medical service security. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sixth, we must pay close attention to the implementation of responsibilities. &lt;/strong>;Work with the health and disease control departments to strengthen the organization, leadership, supervision and inspection of the prevention and control of winter epidemic diseases, coordinate the advancement, and work together to ensure that all prevention and control measures are implemented in detail. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 15:25:05 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
