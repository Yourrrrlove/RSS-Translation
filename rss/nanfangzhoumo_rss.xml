Those who wantonly publish abuses and insults against individuals on the Internet Cyber ​​violence that spreads rumors, defamation, invades privacy and other information must be subject to due legal sanctions. On September 25, the Supreme People&#39;s Court, the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, and the Ministry of Public Security jointly held a press conference to officially release the &quot;Guiding Opinions on Punishing Internet Violence and Crime According to the Law.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Opinions&quot; have a total of 20 articles, mainly covering ten aspects:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, clarify the applicable rules for the crime of online violence. The &quot;Opinions&quot; provide guidance on the nature of online violence in accordance with the criminal law and relevant judicial interpretations. Specifically, those who openly insult others or fabricate facts to slander others on the information network, if the circumstances are serious, will be convicted and punished for the crimes of insult and slander; organize &quot;human flesh searches&quot; to illegally collect and release citizens&#39; personal information to an unspecified majority of people, and the circumstances are In serious cases, they will be convicted and punished for the crime of infringing on citizens&#39; personal information. In addition, the crime of illegal use of information network can be applied to malicious marketing and hype behaviors carried out through cyber violence incidents; the crime of refusing to perform information network security management obligations can be applied to the behavior of failing to perform information network security management obligations in accordance with the law for discovered cyber violence information . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is to clarify the rules for handling illegal online violence. For online violence, we should adhere to multi-dimensional and joint governance and improve the connection mechanism between administrative law enforcement and criminal justice. The &quot;Opinions&quot; stipulate that the implementation of online insults, slander and other online violence does not constitute a crime. If it complies with the provisions of the Public Security Management Punishment Law and other provisions, administrative penalties will be imposed in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third is to clarify the policy principles for punishing cyber violence crimes. The &quot;Opinions&quot; require that the spirit of severe punishment for cyber violence crimes should be reflected so that the people can fully feel fairness and justice. Adhere to strict law enforcement and justice, strictly investigate cyber violence crimes in accordance with the law, and effectively correct the erroneous tendency of &quot;the law does not punish the public&quot;. We must focus on cracking down on malicious initiators, organizers, malicious promoters, and those who persist in reforming despite repeated abuses. The &quot;Opinions&quot; also stipulate that there are those who commit cyber violence against minors and disabled people, organize &quot;trolls&quot; and &quot;thugs&quot; to commit cyber violence, fabricate &quot;sexually related&quot; topics to infringe on the human dignity of others, and use &quot;deep synthesis&quot; and other generative methods If artificial intelligence technology releases illegal information, or if network service providers initiate or organize cyber violence, they will be severely punished in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fourth is to clarify the boundaries between illegal crimes and legal behaviors of online violence. The &quot;Opinions&quot; stipulate that reporting or exposing other people&#39;s crimes or violations of laws and disciplines through information networks should not be considered a defamation crime as long as they do not intentionally fabricate facts or knowingly spread the facts to be fabricated. Commenting and criticizing other people&#39;s words and deeds, even if the views are biased or the speech is extreme, as long as it is not wanton abuse or malicious slander, it should not be considered an insult or crime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fifth is to clarify the work requirements for public security organs to assist in evidence collection. According to the provisions of the Criminal Law, in cases where the victim files a private prosecution for online insult or defamation, if the people&#39;s court determines after review that it is indeed difficult for the victim to provide evidence, it may request the public security organs to provide assistance. The &quot;Opinions&quot; reiterate the provisions of the Criminal Law, and also clarify that the public security organs should promptly identify the perpetrators of online insults and slander according to the requirements of the People&#39;s Court and the specific circumstances of the case, and collect evidence and materials such as the spread and spread of relevant information and the impact caused. Network service providers shall provide necessary technical support and assistance for public security organs to obtain evidence in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sixth is to clarify the public prosecution standards for criminal cases of online insult and defamation. According to the provisions of the Criminal Law, those who commit crimes of insult or slander and seriously endanger social order and national interests shall be prosecuted in accordance with the law. The &quot;Opinions&quot; stipulate that in cases of online insult and defamation, public prosecution procedures will apply if one of the following circumstances occurs: (1) causing serious consequences such as mental disorder or suicide of the victim or his close relatives, and causing a bad impact on society; (2) arbitrarily using The general public is the target of infringement, and relevant information is widely disseminated on the Internet, triggering a large number of vulgar and malicious comments, seriously disrupting the order of the Internet, and having a bad impact on society; (3) Insulting and slandering multiple people or spreading insulting and slanderous information multiple times, causing social harm Those with a bad impact; (4) Organizing and instigating people to spread a large amount of insulting and slanderous information on multiple online platforms, with a bad impact on society; (5) Other situations that seriously endanger social order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The seventh is to clarify the transition process from private prosecution to public prosecution in criminal cases of online insult and defamation. The &quot;Opinions&quot; stipulate that for online insults and slander that seriously endanger social order, the public security organs have filed a case as a public prosecution case, and the victim simultaneously files a private prosecution in the People&#39;s Court, the People&#39;s Court may request the private prosecutor to withdraw the private prosecution or rule not to accept it; it has been accepted If the case is found, a ruling should be made to terminate the trial and the relevant materials should be transferred to the public security organs. The original private prosecutor can participate in the lawsuit as a victim. The victim files a private prosecution before the public security organ files a case. If, upon review, the people&#39;s court determines that the relevant online insults and defamation seriously endanger social order, the case shall be transferred to the public security organ. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eighth, support civil rights protection against online violence in accordance with the law. The &quot;Opinions&quot; stipulate that if cyber violence is committed against others and infringes on others&#39; reputation rights, privacy rights and other personality rights, and the victim requests the perpetrator to bear civil liability, the people&#39;s court will support it in accordance with the law. If the right holder has evidence to prove that the perpetrator is committing or is about to commit an illegal act that infringes upon his or her personality rights, and failure to stop it in time will cause irreparable damage to his or her legitimate rights and interests, the people&#39;s court may, upon the right holder&#39;s application, issue an injunction against infringement of personality rights in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ninth is to clarify the rules for public interest litigation in cases of online violence. The &quot;Opinions&quot; stipulate that if online violence harms public interests, the People&#39;s Procuratorate may file a public interest litigation with the People&#39;s Court in accordance with the law. If a network service provider fails to perform its information network security management obligations in accordance with the law for discovered cyber violence information, resulting in the large-scale dissemination of illegal information or other serious circumstances that harm the public interest, the People&#39;s Procuratorate may file a public interest litigation with the People&#39;s Court in accordance with the law. When handling public interest litigation cases in the field of cyber violence control, the People&#39;s Procuratorate may require network service providers to provide necessary technical support and assistance in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The tenth is to proactively perform duties and promote comprehensive management of cyber violence. The &quot;Opinions&quot; require that when handling cases of cyber violence, information on the progress of the case should be released to the public in a timely manner in accordance with the law, clarify the truth, and eliminate the adverse effects of cyber violence, so as to reduce the harm to the victims and help the victims get out of their predicaments; carry out legal publicity and give full play to law enforcement The role of rule guidance, value orientation and behavioral norms in handling cases is to educate and guide netizens to consciously abide by the law and lead social civilization; to conduct in-depth analysis of the root causes that promote the occurrence of online violence, promote multi-dimensional co-governance of online violence, and fundamentally reduce online violence occurrence, creating a clear cyberspace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 15:55:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[孙一文止步八强，新旧交替的女子重剑队亟待历练]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257567]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/25/qLY0NaAvQ3TEA5d5kye3jm2Vd1xtEzLcs4MrEYLK.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/qLY0NaAvQ3TEA5d5kye3jm2Vd1xtEz Lcs4MrEYLK. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251880&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 24, 2023, women&#39;s individual epee four in the fencing event of the Hangzhou Asian Games In the quarter-finals, Chinese player Sun Yiwen (right) lost to South Korean player Song Shiluo 12-14 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;12 to 14, on September 24, the first official competition day of the Hangzhou Asian Games, in the quarter-finals of the women’s individual epee fencing event at the Hangzhou Asian Games, Chinese player Sun Yiwen lost to South Korean player Song Se-ra and stopped in the quarterfinals. So far, all Chinese players in this project have been eliminated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is Sun Yiwen’s third Asian Games trip. She and her teammates won the women&#39;s epee team championship twice before. At the last Asian Games in Jakarta, Sun Yiwen also reached the finals of individual events, but ultimately lost to South Korean star Kang Young-mi and won a silver medal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This sport pays great attention to variety, balance, game and precision.” A game lasts up to 9 minutes. If you hit at the same time, you must be 1/25 second earlier than the opponent to score. A blink of an eye is 0.75 seconds, which is enough to turn the tide or give up victory. To do this, fencers need to &quot;count one step at a time.&quot; Excellent fencers are often in a &quot;man-sword-in-one&quot; state, that is, under various circumstances, they can hit the opponent&#39;s exposed effective parts (including the torso, legs, feet, hands, arms, and helmets) at the fastest speed and the shortest route. . Behind the &quot;subconscious&quot; sword thrusts again and again is the muscle memory cultivated over many years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tokyo Olympic champion Sun Yiwen is the number one Chinese women&#39;s epee player. He has always been good at &quot;stopping with stillness and attacking later.&quot; &quot;Determined, calm, and explosive&quot; is how she sums up her playing style. However, after winning the Tokyo Olympics and Xi&#39;an Games, Sun Yiwen has been trapped by injuries and will not resume training until October 2022 and systematically participate in events. To &quot;find the feeling of starting over&quot;, the road is rough. Sun Yiwen once lamented that he &quot;can&#39;t even play games anymore&quot; and was &quot;very unfamiliar.&quot; It was not until the International Fencing Federation World Cup Barcelona in February 2023 that he gradually regained his form and won two bronze medals in a row, both individual and team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Y1LICojmKJNk0KhWE9ZrblJq0W0assdjikvr0Ab1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Y1LICojmKJNk0KhWE9ZrblJq0W0assdjikvr0Ab1.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251881&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 24, 2021, Sun Yiwen (right) celebrated with his coach after winning the women&#39;s individual epee final in fencing at the Tokyo Olympics&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot; >;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In previous interviews with the media, Sun Yiwen once said that winning a gold medal is not necessary for this comeback. After reviewing the schedule performance of the last Olympic Games, she and the coaching staff found that although they won the gold medal, many problems and deficiencies were still exposed in the process. If they can be improved, the state will be better than before. &quot;There is a new coach in the team who has taught me many new ideas and moves. Now I dare to try new moves in the game and explore new areas. This is what makes me most interesting and what makes me happy.&quot; The reason why I decided to stick to another Olympic cycle is that I am still learning.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Tokyo Olympics, the Chinese fencing team is facing a transitional period of replacement of old and new players and adjustment of the coaching team. Three-quarters of the athletes participating in the Asian Games have never competed in the Tokyo Olympics. The Hangzhou Asian Games is regarded as an important training opportunity for this young team to prepare for the Paris Olympics. According to the competition plan, the fencing competition of the Hangzhou Asian Games will be held from September 24th to 29th, with a total of 12 gold medals produced. On September 27, Sun Yiwen will also lead his young teammates to continue their pursuit of medals in the women&#39;s epee team competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As Zhang Xin, Secretary-General of the Chinese Sports Delegation at the Hangzhou Asian Games and Director of the Competitive Sports Department of the State Sports General Administration, said, the Hangzhou Asian Games is the &quot;high school entrance examination&quot; before the Paris Olympics. Less than a year later, 32-year-old Sun Yiwen will usher in her third Olympic trip in Paris, and before that, she and the young Chinese fencing team still need to overcome many obstacles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/zSTuMc9YvjlkUYhKNhKW9jT7caOSYptFWqNxmbnw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;692&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/zSTuMc9YvjlkUYhKNhKW9jT7caOSYptFWqNxmbnw.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251882&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On June 20, 2023, in the 2023 Asian Fencing Championships Women’s Epee Team Third Place Competition held in Wuxi, Jiangsu, the Chinese team defeated the Japanese team and won the bronze medal. Chinese team players Tang Junyao (first from left), Lin Sheng (second from left), Zhu Mingye (third from left) and Sun Yiwen took a group photo after the game &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Behind the &quot;Duel of Swords&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Sun Yiwen never considered himself a &quot;talented player&quot;. She attributes her gains in her career to her seriousness and stubbornness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Yiwen was born in Wanggezhuang Village, Qixia City, Yantai, Shandong Province in 1992. When she was young, her health was very poor and she would catch a cold every winter. Sun Yiwen&#39;s father, Sun Hongming, is a local village doctor. Under his father&#39;s supervision and company, she has developed the habit of running and exercising since she was a child. Long-term persistence pays off. In elementary school, Sun Yiwen had become the school&#39;s top sports student. When he was 11 years old, Sun Yiwen was selected by the Qixia Sports and Competition School to focus on middle and long-distance running. Two years later, she had grown to 1.66 meters, and her best standing long jump score was over 2.5 meters. Because of her tallness, long wingspan, strong instantaneous explosive power, and being left-handed, she was spotted by Xu Zhaowei, the then head coach of the Yantai City Fencing Team, and officially embarked on the road of fencing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fencing is a project that requires very comprehensive abilities. &quot;Strength, speed, explosive power, endurance, coordination, flexibility, and thinking&quot;, none of them can be missing. The initial training was hard and boring. Morning training starts at 5:30 in the morning. Basic steps and movements last for several hours. In order to develop their endurance shortcomings, the team members also need to receive additional running training. From Monday to Friday, I run 3,000 meters in the morning and evening, and there is also a 6-kilometer cross-country race on the weekends. If you fail to complete the task within the stipulated time, you will be fined. The longer it takes, the greater the fine. After the high-intensity training during the day, there are cultural classes in the evening. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a week, Sun Yiwen wanted to give up. In order to comfort and encourage his daughter, Sun Hongming rushed to Yantai from his hometown and stayed with his daughter for two days. After the initial adaptation period, Sun Yiwen, who is physically fit and good at thinking, began to gradually emerge. &quot;Every time I practice an action and I can&#39;t do it, I will carefully review it and think about why. Every time I win or lose a game, I will dig deeper into the underlying logic.&quot; At the 2010 Shandong Provincial Games, the 18-year-old Sun Yiwen represented the Yantai Fencing Team and won 8 gold medals with his teammates. After the competition, she was successfully selected for the provincial fencing team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But life was not smooth. For a long time, because there was no establishment in the provincial team, Sun Yiwen had to pay for outings by himself. Sometimes a game would cost half a year&#39;s salary of my father. At that time, his younger brother was still studying at home, and Sun Hongming and his wife were living in a very tight situation in their hometown. Due to technical and tactical breakthroughs facing bottlenecks, Sun Yiwen was withdrawn from the provincial team twice. Worried that he would not be able to get ahead by practicing fencing, Sun Yiwen once proposed to his father that he should give up fencing and go out to work to support his family as soon as possible. The father knows his daughter&#39;s thoughts well. Just like when he was a child, Sun Hongming sought psychological relief on the one hand, and actively communicated with the coach on the other. In the end, no one gave up. Fortunately, under the advice of her coach, Sun Yiwen began to try to change the gun-handled sword to a straight-handled sword. After that, her hard training finally paid off. For a time, there was no female player in the province who could match her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2013, Sun Yiwen was selected for the national fencing team. In the same year, at the age of 21, she made her debut in international competitions and won the women&#39;s epee World Cup Grand Prix team championship. Two years later, she won her first individual championship at the Italian Fencing World Cup. However, it was the 2021 Tokyo Olympics that really brought Sun Yiwen to the pinnacle of his career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 2016 Rio Olympics, Sun Yiwen, as a &quot;dark horse&quot;, won the individual bronze medal and team silver medal in women&#39;s epee. But with the end of the Rio Olympics, the national women&#39;s fencing team has also undergone earth-shaking changes. At that time, the head coach &quot;Bole&quot; Levavasseur, who had a profound influence on Sun Yiwen&#39;s thinking and technology, resigned, and the main players such as Xu Anqi and Sun Yujie retired. The burden of leading the new team suddenly fell on Sun Yiwen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/O0mKyXd6lHmdwegDkVKOPAasw1yJDwy0BEGRnrOb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;656&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/O0mKyXd6lHmdwegDkVKOPAasw1yJDwy0BEGRnrOb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251883&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Sun Yiwen&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, Sun Yiwen was used to &quot; The &quot;second intention&quot; style of play is to first use fake moves to confuse the opponent, and then attack by surprise. However, the successor head coach Yuge Oberly is good at direct offensive tactics, which is exactly Sun Yiwen&#39;s shortcoming. During the running-in period, which lasted for about a year, Sun Yiwen&#39;s performance in competitions has been mediocre. She felt as if she had returned to the state when she had just joined the fencing team at the age of 15, and everything had to start from scratch. &quot;My thoughts and thoughts at that time were completely chaotic, like a ball of knotted hemp rope.&quot; She has experienced too many ups and downs. Sun Yiwen could only encourage himself silently, &quot;This state must be temporary. There will always be low points in life. It depends on how you overcome it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, due to the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics, Held in 2016, Sun Yiwen adjusted back to his form in time during the Olympic points competition. By blending the strengths of both sets of technical ideas, she developed a new combat style. In the summer of 2021, she won the gold medal in the Tokyo Olympics women&#39;s epee individual finals, defeating Romania&#39;s Popescu, who was ranked number one in the world at the time. The only regret was that in the subsequent team competition, Sun Yiwen was injured and had to be replaced. The Chinese women&#39;s epee team eventually failed to reach the top four of the team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Tokyo Olympics, Sun Yiwen missed several major events in 2022 due to injuries. In an interview with the media in early 2022, she described her injuries this way, &quot;I now have a torn posterior cruciate ligament and water accumulation in my left leg, a knee cyst, a worn meniscus, and a long stretch from the back of my right leg to the knee. Injury. Even if I move a few times or when the weather is bad, my knee will still hurt.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike many other sports, few people can maintain absolute dominance in the field of fencing. force. In the past year, Sun Yiwen has been participating in the competition while sick due to the lumbosacral pressure on the nerves in her legs. She has been exploring how to coexist with the injury technically and psychologically. At the World Fencing Championships in Milan in July, Sun Yiwen won the bronze medal in the women&#39;s epee individual event. This was her first time winning an individual event medal at the World Championships. In a post-match interview, Sun Yiwen said that this bronze medal was a &quot;heart booster&quot; for her and made her understand that she &quot;can do it&quot; despite injuries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I don&#39;t care about winning or losing, but I have perseverance. I think I can do things that others can do. Injuries, difficulties and problems are in front of me, and I will never run away from them. I won&#39;t be afraid, I will definitely solve it. The higher you go, the more problems you will encounter.&quot; In Sun Yiwen&#39;s view, the most important lesson her 18-year fencing career has taught her is &quot;not to accept weakness. Don’t admit defeat.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;(Reference materials: &quot;Blog World&quot;, &quot;GQ Report&quot;, Chao News, Dazhong Yantai Channel, Forbes China, &quot;Wonderful OK&quot;, &quot;Qilu Evening News&quot;, China News Network, &quot;Beijing Daily&quot;, Shangguan News, etc.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[从北京、广州到杭州：33年3届亚运会见证中国经济社会发展与国民精神进化丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257571]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On September 23, 2023, the 19th Asian Games opened in Hangzhou. During the lighting ceremony, a giant &quot;digital man&quot; rushed from outside the venue and lit the main torch together with the real people present, bringing this technologically full opening ceremony to a climax. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s not just about digital people igniting fires. This opening ceremony can be said to be the opening ceremony of a sports meeting with the strongest sense of technology to date. A &quot;net screen&quot; with a total length of 185 meters and a height of 20 meters hangs in the air, and a 6,000-square-meter ground screen on the ground turns the &quot;Big Lotus&quot; of the Hangzhou Olympic Sports Center Stadium into a huge three-dimensional display screen. In addition, with the blessing of naked-eye 3D, AR and other digital technologies, the digital fireworks are dazzling, and the opening performance combines virtual and real scenes, giving it a full sense of the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the third time China has hosted the Asian Games in more than 30 years. The hosting of these three Asian Games also reflects the development process of China&#39;s economic society and national spiritual mentality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1990, the 11th Asian Games was held in Beijing. This was the first time that China hosted a large-scale international comprehensive sports event. It was also the early stage of China&#39;s reform and opening up. In 1983, China applied to host the Asian Games, hoping to show an image of openness to the outside world. Economically, China&#39;s development was just starting at that time. By 1990, when the Asian Games were held, the country&#39;s total GDP was only 1.89 trillion yuan, less than 360.9 billion U.S. dollars. Its per capita GDP ranked outside the 130th place in the world, and it was also the lowest in Asia. Not forward. At that time, even the preparations for the Asian Games lacked funds, so they had to launch a nationwide fundraising campaign. Tens of millions of people across the country participated and donated a total of 270 million yuan, more than one-tenth of the total investment in the Beijing Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second time China hosted the Asian Games was the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games. In the past 20 years, especially at the beginning of the new century, China&#39;s accession to the WTO and integration into the global market have made China the world&#39;s factory, and its economy has developed by leaps and bounds. Although affected by the financial crisis in 2008, China&#39;s economy quickly resumed development. In 2010, China&#39;s total GDP exceeded 40 trillion yuan, equivalent to more than 6 trillion US dollars, surpassing Japan for the first time, ranking first in Asia and second in the world. The Asian Games will be held in Guangzhou. Guangzhou has been a commercial capital for thousands of years and the forefront of reform and opening up. The Pearl River Delta is also the most active region for China&#39;s export-oriented economy and one of China&#39;s most important manufacturing and foreign trade bases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This time, the Hangzhou Asian Games has been more than ten years since the Guangzhou Asian Games. Over the past ten years, China&#39;s economy has nearly tripled. More importantly, the scientific and technological content of China&#39;s economy has also been greatly improved, especially in the field of digital economy, which leads the world. Hangzhou is the home base of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. The gorgeous digital people and digital fireworks at the opening ceremony of the Hangzhou Asian Games are a concentrated display of China&#39;s high-end digital technology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the attention attracted by these three Asian Games is also different. I believe older friends will have a better understanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the successful bid to the preparation and successful hosting of the Beijing Asian Games, it has attracted unprecedented attention from the whole country. I remember that televisions were not yet popular in China, especially in rural areas. Black and white TVs were rare, and color TVs were even rarer. In some villages, only the village committee had a color TV for villagers to watch. Farmers are busy with farm work during the day and have no time to watch the live broadcast of the Asian Games. At night, the color TV in the village committee is crowded with farmers watching the game. Of course, more news about the game was heard from the loudspeaker broadcast in the village the next morning. Every time there was news that the Chinese team had won, it would cause a burst of carnival. The emblem composed of the Great Wall pattern, the mascot panda Panpan, and the promotional song &quot;Asian Heroes&quot; have all become the memories of a generation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The opening ceremony of the Guangzhou Asian Games was ingenious and brilliant. The &quot;Sail of White Clouds&quot; showed a grand atmosphere of openness and pioneering. However, in terms of attention, I am afraid it cannot compare with the national participation of the Beijing Asian Games. the hot state. I came to Guangzhou from Beijing to work in October 2010, just before the Guangzhou Asian Games. Just two years ago, China just hosted the 2008 Olympic Games. All the top events in the world have been held, and the psychological threshold of the Chinese people has naturally increased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, mobile networks have become the main channel of communication. Everyone has a variety of short videos and news apps installed on their mobile phones. Even payment tools such as Alipay have video reports of the Asian Games. Information about the Asian Games can be received anytime and anywhere. In such a convenient communication environment, more than 100 million people participated in the Asian Games digital torch relay event. However, with the continuous evolution of lifestyles, we can no longer see the state where everyone sits in front of the TV. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The change in attention to the Asian Games is also an inevitable result of the development of China&#39;s economic society and national mentality. At the time of the Beijing Asian Games, China&#39;s economy was still relatively backward. The Asian Games was an opportunity to unite the strength of the Chinese people and show their national pride. The vigorous publicity by the official media made the Beijing Asian Games known to everyone. As for the Guangzhou Asian Games and this time the Hangzhou Asian Games, with the improvement of China&#39;s economic level, there have been countless world-class sports events held in China. Ordinary people also have more channels to access more information, and their attention is divided. Of course, this is also a good thing. Those who love sports will continue to pay attention to the Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third Asian Games in thirty years is a testimony to China’s development and the evolution of the national spirit. In this sense, the opening ceremony of the Asian Games has increased technological content and attracted less attention than it did in the past, which is a reflection of its richness, development and progress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 14:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“常·识”背后的南方报业融合转型密码]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257611]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25 14:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A few days ago, Huang Changkai, Secretary of the Party Committee and President of Southern Newspaper Media Group, wrote the monograph &quot;Common Knowledge - Southern The book &quot;Newspaper Media Convergence Comics&quot; was officially published by Nanfang Daily Publishing House. This is another professional masterpiece by the author following &quot;Communication Power - Media Integration Practice of Southern Newspaper Industry&quot;, which deeply summarizes the practice and experience of the integration transformation of southern newspapers and profoundly explains the understanding and understanding of the regularity of integration transformation of provincial party newspaper groups. Although the title of the book is &quot;Common Knowledge&quot;, it is closely combined with the extraordinary process of the southern newspaper industry in recent years to successfully explore the path of integrated development that is in line with the spirit of the central government, industry trends and with southern characteristics. It shows the southern newspaper people&#39;s perspective on media integration and transformation. Deep understanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/5b8d0c05c65e1a924c997e724b8104c4.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/5b8d0c05c65e1a924c997e724b8104c4.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252058&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Book and video of &quot;Common Knowledge - Comics on the Integration of Southern Newspaper and Media&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Looking at integration transformation from eight sets of dialectical relationships&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;:&lt;/span >;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Without communication power, there is nothing&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the era of mobile Internet, how to promote the development of media integration is a question of the times and also of contemporary media. A must-answer question for people&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;. Media integration is a systematic project that involves &lt;span>;&lt;/span>;innovation of ideas, content, forms, methods, and means. It involves many tasks such as resource integration, process optimization, and platform reengineering, and involves all aspects of technology, operation, and management problems. . Where to solve the problem and how to solve the problem? How to focus on the key reforms that &quot;pulse one person to mobilize the whole body&quot;, innovative measures to achieve the traction effect of &quot;one child is full of vitality&quot;, and how to rectify the complex relationships between various aspects and different links? To this, we can find part of the answer just from the content structure of the book &quot;Common Knowledge&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the content structure, the book is divided into eight themes, namely &quot;Old Business and New Business&quot;, &quot;Rice Bowl and Stage&quot;, &quot;Career and Talent&quot;, &quot;Main Business and Industry&quot;, &quot;Content and Technology&quot; &quot;Removal of disadvantages and innovation&quot;, &quot;Management and construction&quot;, &quot;Big ecology and small ecology&quot;. Furthermore, the eight themes actually illustrate eight sets of major dialectical relationships that need to be accurately grasped to crack media integration. For example, &quot;Old Industry and New Industry&quot; focuses on a dialectical view of the relationship between traditional media and emerging media, and how to achieve complementary advantages, one can grow stronger than the other, and one can be better than the other during the iterative process of integration and transformation. &quot;Jobs and Stages&quot; focuses on how, in the face of the irreversible trend of the decline of traditional media, how to build a bigger and stronger self-controlled and controllable communication platform, provide a secure job, and create a stage for entrepreneurs to start their own business.以此类推，“事业与人才”关切的是融合转型的人才队伍建设；“主业与产业”探讨的是如何实现采编与经营的良性互促；“内容与技术”关注的是筑牢融合转型的技术底盘；“除弊与革新”指向的是融合转型的体制机制变革；“管理与建设”聚焦的是守好意识形态主阵地，如何既要管住又要管得出新出彩；“大生态与小生态”，展现的是对南方报业这样拥有多个子媒、多端口、多阵地的省级党报集团来说，如何构建错位发展、协同融洽的全媒体传播体系，放大融合发展的传播力和影响力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/3bc02f7af596f0fabf0199532b415f1d.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;530&quot;

&lt;p>;详读《常·识》不难看出，八组辩证关系不是“凭空之论”，而是源于南方报业成功的融合转型实践，是融合转型“南方打法”的深刻总结。近年来，南方报业以提升现代传播力为首要任务，深入实施“三个一体化”和“四化”战略战术（详见《传播力——南方报业媒体融合实践》一书），构建起覆盖用户超4.57亿的报刊网端微屏全媒体传播体系，旗下南方日报、南方杂志、南方网、南方农村报、南方周末、南方都市报、南方+客户端等7家媒体机构全部跻身“亿元媒体”俱乐部，南方+、GDToday 新闻网（客户端）、南周App、南都App、N视频、粤学习等自主可控、传播力强的新型传播平台发展势头良好，南方+以超1.7亿下载量和日活超600万的出色表现，牢牢占据广东省委省政府第一权威移动发布平台地位，位列全国省级党报自有客户端传播力第一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这样的融合转型不俗表现，正是源于对书中所探讨的八组辩证关系的正确把握。作者所谓“漫论”，绝非泛泛而论，关注的恰恰是媒体融合转型的一系列重点难题、重要主题、重大课题。作者对八组辩证关系的深入阐释，是对有效破解媒体融合转型那些“既要、又要”两难问题的回答，从中亦可窥见南方报业融合转型的成功密码。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;从“常·识”感受规律性认识：&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;转型不是转行&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;作者在自序中称，“书名曰《常·识》，既有平常观点之意，也是正常见识之谓”。综观全书对“没有传播力就没有一切”“南方+要出什么圈”“名记要成为怎样的人”“我们要做什么样的产业” “让管住管好从&#39;两难&#39;变成&#39;两全&#39;”等一系列行业关切话题的深入论述，可谓“金句频出”，给人留下了深刻印象。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;常识不同寻常。一直以来，面对互联网新媒体持续猛烈的冲击，媒体转型向何处去，是&lt;span>;最突出&lt;/span>;的难题。实践证明，对这个问题能否正确作答，往往决定了一个媒体的路径选择和前途未来。对此，作者明确指出“转型不是转行”，强调“作为主流媒体，不管报刊、广电还是网站、客户端，我们都要扪心自问：我们到底是做什么的”“南方报业要清楚自己的定位，不管怎么转、怎么融，媒体属性的基石地位不容动摇”。在行业激烈变革的当下，坚守“乱云飞渡仍从容”的战略定力，虽是常识，却仍需要不同寻常的“人间清醒”。类似还有书中的“轻忽媒体业务无异于舍本逐末”“自主可控不等于从零开始”，等等，看似并不深奥玄妙的道理，却往往需要人们在融合转型的现实中作出清醒正确的抉择。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/1ddee1f0902287b520469a2b18222ed6.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;640&quot;

&lt;p>;常识也是共识。正如作者所言，《常·识》“呈现的绝不是我一个人的实践思考，而是集体智慧的结晶”，既源自南方报业融合转型实践，也凝练了南方报业全体员工的共识。透过书中的论述不难看出，诸如“将内容生产传播作为安身立命之本”“建设新型主流媒体要抱持&#39;长期主义&#39;”“南方报业最珍贵的资产有两项：第一项是人才，第二项是传播力”“名记不是评出来的，是打出来的”“只有&#39;下沉&#39;才能基业长青”，不仅仅是南方报业融合转型坚持的重要理念原则，也早已融入集团发展的日常，成为南方报业上下践行的共识。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;常识更是规律性认识。书中很多“金句”，既是洞见，也体现着对媒体融合发展规律的深刻认识。比如，谈到转型的实质，指出“转型，就是媒体从&#39;纸&#39;的形态转成&#39;网&#39;的形态；融合，就是新旧两种媒体形态的融合共生”；谈到主业和产业的关系，指出“通过做强主业，让传播力、影响力产生溢出效益，从而搞好主业经营，撬动产业、带来多元收入”；谈到技术与内容的关系，指出“内容传播到哪里，技术支撑就跟到哪里”……类似这样的论述，无疑对整个业界都有极强的启发意义。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;媒体融合发展是一篇大文章。今年是习近平总书记作出“加快传统媒体和新兴媒体融合发展”重要指示10&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;周年。在这样一个重要的时间节点，《常·识》的出版，无疑为我们总结整个行业的媒体融合转型实践，加快推进媒体融合向纵深发展提供了可供研究的生动样本和借鉴参考。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/1f89d7f6202dd2ba9ff83a96f15f47a8.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;北京，国家审计署。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（人民视觉/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;截至2023年4月，对2021年度审计发现的问题，已整改问题金额8501.11亿元，完善制度2900多项，追责问责1.4万多人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是2023年6月26日，审计署审计长侯凯在作《国务院关于2022年度中央预算执行和其他财政收支的审计工作报告》时公布的数据。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;看到2022年度审计工作报告时，中国审计学会副会长、西南财经大学会计学院教授蔡春认为，随着审计水平的提高和制度建设的完善，审计已是常态化服务国家治理。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;公众对审计工作产生印象至少是20年前的事。 2003年6月25日，时任审计署审计长李金华向全国人大常委会作2002年度审计工作报告，财政部、教育部、原国家计委等一批部委被公开批评。那时，互联网刚刚兴起不久，报告在审计署官网全文公开，引发全民关注，并称其为“审计风暴”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南京审计大学政府审计学院教授郑小荣认为，20年前，公众曾习惯政府对财政收支情况保密，在当时，“公开本身就是一个热点”，而现在，即使舆论不关注，审计也照常发挥作用。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而回顾过往20年不难发现，随着社会的发展，审计的重点也在发生改变。不同时期有不同重点，有些内容已成为历史。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;和盘托出&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2022年度审计工作报告有不少亮点。不同于以往的科技成果转化审计，这次首次聚焦基础研究和关键核心技术攻坚任务，指出部分任务部署和要求偏离预定目标，部分科研成果涉嫌造假等问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;审计发现，45项重点任务从制定实施方案到签订任务合同，层层降低指标要求，有的技术国内已量产，无需攻关。 649个已验收项目通过率为96.5%，但抽查其中135个发现实际有34个未完成全部任务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;郑小荣观察到，“年年审，年年发现问题”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年度审计工作报告指出，41个地区向亏损企业征收国有资本收益、征收过头税费或直接乱罚款乱摊派等，违规组织财政收入77.5亿元；49个地区通过承诺兜底回购、国有企业垫资建设等方式，违规新增隐性债务415.16亿元；12个地区不得不从上级超预算额度调拨库款、由银行垫款或对外借款280.72亿元维持基本运转。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中央各部委所属单位疏于管理和监督的问题仍然存在。例如，3个部门和29家所属单位铺张浪费，有的多花费2700多万元租用办公场所，人均办公面积达137平方米，有的超合同进度年底突击花钱8458.07万元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;20年前,类似的问题就被点名，2002年度审计工作报告曾指出，一部委编造虚假项目预算，并与某工程处签订虚假施工合同，将135万元预算资金拨付该工程处，然后分批收回，主要用于发放职工补贴。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一名审计干部回忆，正是在2003年，审计署才被公众认识。距离审计署成立的1983年，已过去20年。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2003年6月25日，2002年度审计工作报告在审计署官网全文公开后，被媒体广泛转载。兰州大学经济学院教授杨肃昌仍对这份报告带来的震惊记忆犹新，“（原来）问题这么严重”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这一年披露的问题包括：县市财政收入“水分”较大，人为隐瞒赤字普遍，债务负担沉重；企业漏缴基本养老保险基金问题比较普遍，有关管理部门挤占挪用4.2亿元；教育部全国大学英语四六级考试委员会违规集中各地考试费2.24亿元，从中坐支相关考试费用等1.9亿元。等等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由于公布的问题触目惊心，公众将其称为“审计风暴”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，“审计风暴”或可再往前追溯到1999年。按照当时的审计工作程序，每年5月份，审计署要就上一年审计工作情况向国务院出具审计结果报告，根据这份报告，再起草向全国人大常委会提交的审计工作报告。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;向全国人大常委会的报告和盘托出了审计发现的问题。 1999年6月26日，李金华向全国人大常委会作《1998年度审计工作报告》，指出国务院43个部门和直属单位挤占挪用财政资金31.24亿元等问题，《中国经济时报》曾援引部分委员的话，表示是“多年来最好的一个审计工作报告”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;十八大后扶贫审计成为重点&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2003年以来，审计工作都聚焦了哪些领域？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者梳理发现，从2002年到2022年的21份《审计工作报告》中，除每年固定的财政审计外，资源环境保护、社保基金、农业农村是最为关注的领域，分别出现17次、13次、13次。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不同时期，审计工作也有不同重点。以“三公”经费为例，2007年度审计工作报告用了103个字，首次指出税务部门存在无编制和超编制购置小汽车，以及招待费、会议费、培训费和出国费控制不够严格的问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中共十八大后，随着中央八项规定的制定、执行，“三公”经费开始成为审计监督的重点。 2013年度审计工作报告史无前例地用1244字的篇幅，直指“三公”经费和会议费管理使用问题，点名22个中央部门和所属单位。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2014年，中央部门“三公”经费和会议费支出比上年下降27%，部门本级公务用车改革基本完成。但审计仍然发现，科技部、原文化部等33个部门和单位长期占用其他单位车辆，或以租赁方式变相配备公务用车122辆。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;之后连续九年，“三公”经费一直都被提及。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;扶贫也一度是报告关注的焦点。 2013年11月提出“精准扶贫”战略后，次年，审计报告在时隔十年之后，再次出现关于扶贫审计的内容。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;报告指出，审计19个国家扶贫开发工作重点县后发现，1595.71万元扶贫资金被个人侵占，1.73亿元扶贫资金被虚报冒领或挤占挪用，有5个县的扶贫工作主管部门在扶贫管理费等经费中违规列支吃喝、旅游费用53.36万元，还有2.27亿元扶贫资金闲置1年以上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/evLOaYcG1oPhzGE1tX8YmI86cZI29BnAy3yyGxM4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1271&quot; height=&quot;739&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/evLOaYcG1oPhzGE1tX8YmI86cZI29BnAy3yyGxM4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251919&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2022年度审计工作报告指出，高标准农田建设资金，地方统筹整合使用时存在难度。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（人民视觉/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2015年11月29日，中共中央、国务院发布《关于打赢脱贫攻坚战的决定》，提出确保到2020年农村贫困人口实现脱贫，要求抓好精准识别、建档立卡关键环节，使建档立卡贫困人口中有5000万人左右通过产业扶持等措施实现脱贫。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这在第二年的报告中就有所体现，《2015年度审计工作报告》提到，抽查云南省寻甸县2015年发放的1339笔扶贫到户贴息贷款6560万元中，仅有711笔3433万元（占52%）发放给建档立卡贫困户。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年至今，报告则连续两年对就业补助和促进就业资金进行审计。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;有板块7次更名&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;20年来，审计工作报告的形式也在发生改变。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一个变化是报告名称。 2013年作的2012年度审计报告名称为《关于2012年度中央预算执行和其他财政收支的审计工作报告》，次年改为《国务院关于2013年度中央预算执行和其他财政收支的审计工作报告》，这一格式固定至今。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这不是简单地多了3个字。郑小荣认为，根据审计法规定，审计工作报告由国务院向全国人大常委会提出，在实践中由审计署代表国务院作报告。标题中增加“国务院”更符合审计法精神，也更能体现审计工作报告的权威性。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2018年，审计工作报告开篇的称呼，则由此前的“全国人民代表大会常务委员会”，调整为“委员长、各位副委员长、秘书长，各位委员”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在郑小荣看来，全国人大常委会是一个机构，后者更为具体，“类似于点名”,称呼的变化是“希望在审议、决议工作报告时，每位参会者都高度重视，强化人大监督的作用”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;公众对哪些单位被点名格外关注。 20年来，“点名”经历了从模糊到逐步清晰的过程，被点名单位的数量也有变化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2002年度审计工作报告模糊处理了部分地区和单位信息，用“某省”“某区政府”“部分航空公司”等替代。而审计发现的违法违纪人员，直到2006年度审计工作报告才开始出现当事人姓名，此前只点出其单位和职务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;郑小荣认为，这是审计机关谨慎的表现，信息公开在当时仍然敏感，“信息公开以后，会有意想不到的结果”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;另一个变化是，2017年以后，报告中点名的单位数量减少。南方周末记者不完全统计，2017年报告点名24家单位，这一数字在2018年下降到3家。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在西南财经大学审计系主任李越冬看来，这与审计功能的变化有一定关系，“现在更多的是帮助被审计单位解决问题。”审计取证的时间有限，也更加强调发现重大问题，“一些小问题不一定出现在报告中，告知整改就可以了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;郑小荣补充说，过去一些被审计单位在工作过程中不太配合，在报告中点名一度是促进其整改的方法。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;审计工作报告中的固定章节，也经历了多次更名。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者梳理发现，2008年度审计工作报告首次出现“重大违法违规问题揭露和查处情况”这一章节，除了公布移送的重大违法违规问题和经济犯罪案件线索数量、涉案人数外，还对犯罪形式、手段和方法进行总结。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此后，该章节历经7次更名，如2012年的“审计查出的重大违法违规问题和经济犯罪案件”，2013年改为“审计发现的重大违法违规案件情况”，2014年是“审计查出的涉嫌重大违法违规案件情况”。 2021年更名为“重大违纪违法问题线索”并保留至今，提及的问题包括“小官贪腐”、基层微腐败和“靠山吃山”等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在21份审计工作报告中，章节的内容、位置和名称，整体并不固定。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;郑小荣也注意到这个现象，他认为，在制度逐渐规范的过程中，审计机关对审计工作报告的形式具有裁量权，也会影响报告的文本形式和框架。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;打破壁垒&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“不同层级的政府，都承担着公共受托经济责任，在履行责任的同时，政府也被赋予了特定的权力。”蔡春认为，审计的作用，就是保障政府责任的履行，促进公共权力的运用。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者梳理发现，2009年度审计工作报告，就已经指出地方政府债务总体规模较大、部分地方政府偿债压力较大、财政资金偿债能力不足的问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;之后，按照国务院要求，2011年审计署组织全国审计机关4万多人，以“见账、见人、见物，逐笔、逐项审核”为原则，对全国所有涉及地方政府性债务的25590个政府部门和机构、6576家融资平台公司、54061个其他单位、373805个项目和1873683笔债务进行审计。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;审计整改一度是“老大难”问题。在2021年审计法修订前，对于审计对象不按要求整改的，该采取什么样的措施，并没有作出具体规定。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;直到新修订的审计法作出回应：“审计结果以及整改情况应当作为考核、任免、奖惩领导干部和制定政策、完善制度的重要参考；拒不整改或者整改时弄虚作假的，依法追究法律责任。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据审计法规定，审计机关受本级政府和上一级审计机关双重领导。而在现实中，本级政府对本级审计机关的影响更大。湖南省怀化市审计局工作人员刘空军曾在2009年发表文章称，当地13个县(市、区)基层审计机关，62%的班子成员调整没有事先征求上一级审计机关的意见，双重管理流于形式。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而据郑小荣介绍，在审计结果上报本级人大前，政府有机会拦截、筛选反映的问题，“有些问题不能查深查透，监督权没办法往下延伸”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2010年前后，关于审计体制改革的问题有多种观点，根据一篇2013年发布于审计署官网的文章中，审计署长沙办黄凯把各方观点归纳为升格论、垂直论、独立论和立法论。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而最被业内人士推崇的是立法论，审计机关隶属于人民代表大会，对政府部门独立行使审计监督权力。早在2002年，杨肃昌对62位审计署官员、地方审计机关官员、政府官员、人大干部、审计学者开展问卷调查，其中77%的受访者赞同或基本赞同立法型审计体制改革。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对审计体制改革的讨论没有停止。 2017年12月，中共十九大召开后，杨肃昌受审计署邀请，讨论审计体制改革的走向。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;答案很快揭晓。 2018年3月，中共中央印发《深化党和国家机构改革方案》，宣布组建中央审计委员会。 “没想到会成立。”杨肃昌说，从现实角度看，“在中央审计委员会的领导下，审计工作与党的领导和监督体制融为一体。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;审计发现的问题“必须向中央审计委员会报告，而且是直达”。郑小荣认为，虽然目前审计机关仍然受本级政府和上一级审计机关双重领导，但中央审计委员会打破了政府管理下形成的壁垒。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[印度裔CEO正在“统治”世界，凭的是什么？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257541]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, there is a half-joking saying circulating in the field of workplace human resources (HR): Indians are using a A strange way to &quot;rule&quot; the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meaning is: Indian-origin professional managers and workplace elites are achieving greater and greater success in the world. More than 30% of the CEOs of large Silicon Valley companies in the United States are Indians. Among U.S. companies, the top ten Indian-Americans serve as chairman, CEO, president, and chief operating officer: Google &amp;amp; Alphabet, Microsoft, FedEx, IBM, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, NetApp, Barclays Group, Starbucks, and Adobe , Micron Technology and other world-renowned companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Led by this type of Indian professional managers who hold top-level positions, these companies have recruited a large number of younger, lower-level Indian elites for high- and middle-level management positions, technical positions, Key positions such as finance and human resources are increasingly occupied by Indian career elites. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Indians have an increasing influence in the Western world and have become the most powerful minority group in American and British societies. Many Westerners know that Indians are not easy to mess with, and the social status they have gained , the social achievements achieved far exceed those of local Chinese. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have interviewed some HR organizations to understand why they are willing to promote Indian professional managers, what employers think of Indian managers, and why Indians have achieved such achievements. The feedback received shows that Indians The advantages of ethnic-American workplace elites are roughly as follows:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Value recognition: India was a British colony for a long time, and Indians were once ridiculed as British &quot;long-term laborers and coolies.&quot; However, Indians identify with and want to integrate into Britain and the United States. Social and lifestyle motivations are strong. Their purpose of studying hard is often to enter the British and American society, and gradually become &quot;foremen, housekeepers, and shopkeepers&quot; from &quot;long-term workers&quot;. When Indians go to Britain and the United States, they have no intention of going back. Instead, they try their best to take root there and transform from &quot;Indians&quot; to &quot;Indians.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Communication advantages: As a former British colony, high-end schools in India focus on English education. Therefore, its educational elites, despite their thick accents, have no barriers to language communication, which is a great advantage in the British and American workplaces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because Hindi belongs to the &quot;Eurasian language family&quot; and has many similarities with Western languages, based on Hinglish, there are also fewer obstacles for Indians to learn French, German, and Spanish. few. Therefore, the current trend of Indian workplace elites spreading from English-speaking societies to the entire Western world. The second communication advantage of Indians is that their living customs advocate chatting, chatting, and debating. Therefore, they can get along well with Westerners. Even if they have different opinions, they can chat and dare to talk. It is easier for them to get familiar with each other, which is good for promotion. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cultural diversity: India has 6 major religions, 22 official regional languages, 212 ethnic groups, and 414 tribes. Religions, cultures, and living customs vary greatly among regions and ethnic groups. Such a complex society makes Indians more adaptable to culturally diverse lifestyles. There has never been a &quot;grand unification&quot; in India&#39;s history, and its unification was all established with the help of the British. Therefore, when Indians come to the Western world, not only do they not find it weird and weird, but they think Westerners are too serious, rigid, and simple. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teamwork: Indians focus on teamwork and interpersonal relationships, and their individuals usually have good interpersonal and communication skills, which are very important for senior management positions. Indians are very cooperative, and Indian executives in companies try their best to recruit Indian employees. There have even been cases of fraud: when an American hospital recruits doctors, the Indian director throws away all the resumes of non-Indian applicants. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The folk rule of the Indian people is: those who are successfully recruited should give all of their 1-3 months&#39; salary (the higher the position, the higher the kickback) to the recruiter to express their gratitude for the kindness. . Almost no one in the Indian community violates this convention, forming a long-standing custom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obedience and loyalty: Corresponding to the above-mentioned Indian workplace custom of &quot;recruitment kickbacks&quot;, Indian employees are highly obedient to their superiors. Their subordinates are very good at communicating with their leaders. They will often ask their leaders: What else do you need from me? What am I not doing well? What can you do to be more satisfied? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you have hired Indians, you will feel that they are generally more submissive, reliable, and secure, and leaders will gradually feel comfortable appointing and promoting them. One way of saying it is that Indian people often shake their heads slightly (to express approval and obedience) and say: I see, I see (I understand). It is known as &quot;Ah San, Ah San&quot; by Chinese people. Another theory is that Asan is &quot;Asir&quot;. At that time, the British often recruited Indians to serve as police officers in the colonies or concessions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People recruited by themselves are more capable, less likely to get into trouble, and less likely to cheat. This is also the reason why Indian executives dare to recruit subordinates of the same race. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Resilience: Americans love to mock their government as useless and their president as incompetent. In the eyes of Indians, their own country and government are even worse. In order to survive in their own country, Indians have learned to persevere and make full use of limited resources to live under endless harsh conditions. This ability makes Indian employees more hardworking and hardworking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Humility: As new immigrants from a backward and poor society, Indians understand and admit their limitations and deficiencies in many aspects. Therefore, they are more humble and open-minded during the learning process, making it easier for them to integrate into the local area and be accepted by the local society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Educational advantages in technology and engineering fields: As a late-developing country, India&#39;s education is similar to that in East Asia, with more emphasis on science and technology, engineering and other science and engineering courses. It is particularly distinctive in fields such as computers, engineering, and technological innovation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Indian Institute of Technology&quot; even boasts that &quot;those who cannot get into Indian Institute of Technology should go to MIT.&quot; This is of course bragging, but the large number of science and engineering talents it has trained have just made up for the excessive wealth in the English-speaking world. After a long period of peace, more and more wealthy young people no longer want to study hard to study science and engineering, but study &quot;literature, history, philosophy and arts&quot;. ” and other weaknesses of so-called “rich people’s disciplines”. The &quot;rich N generation&quot; in Europe and the United States learn the art of maintaining success and the method of controlling people, while the science and engineering talents from India serve as CEOs, directors, managers, technological elites... to achieve their own class jump. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dare to take risks and start a business: Indian individuals are more willing to take risks and start a business. They are more willing to set up their own companies and serve as CEOs after they grow. This entrepreneurial tendency has made them achieve great success in the business world. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, Indians are moving from the business world to the political world, and the jokes about &quot;dominating&quot; the world are gradually becoming serious: British Prime Minister Sunak, Singaporean President Shanmugaratnam, Irish Prime Minister Varadkar, Portuguese Prime Minister Costa, and the President of Mauritius Roopun, Prime Minister Jugnauth, Guyana President Irfaan Ali, Suriname President Santokhi, etc. are all Indians. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are currently too many Indian cabinet members in the U.S. government: Assistant to the President and Domestic Policy Advisor, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Deputy Director of the National Economic Council, Senior Advisor to the Secretary of State, White House Chip Advisor and U.S. Commerce The department’s chief economist, deputy director of the White House Office of Presidential Personnel, senior White House staff and presidential speech writers are all Indians. However, Indians only account for 1.4% of the U.S. population. With such a small population weight, they can leverage such huge political influence.
