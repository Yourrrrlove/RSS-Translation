Of course, the most important thing is to &quot;prepare&quot; and &quot;meet&quot; various audits and inspections. From a classification point of view, these &quot;tasks&quot; are as small as a feather. From a jurisdictional level, they include provinces, cities, districts and even streets. From a jurisdictional department point of view, there are both education authorities. , there are also people from other management departments, and there are even departments that are “incomparable”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you carefully observe these various and minute &quot;tasks&quot;, it is not difficult to find an interesting phenomenon, that is, in administrative management, formalism always naturally tends to be introverted, from top to bottom. The vertical involution is manifested in the &quot;increased pressure at every level&quot; of supervision, that is, subordinates always automatically tend to &quot;work harder&quot; to complete &quot;tasks&quot;, and the closer the management level is to the grassroots, the more serious this &quot;work harder&quot; will be. Horizontal involution manifests itself as competitive pressure. For example, if department A organizes an inspection of a certain unit, department B will soon organize an inspection of a certain unit. Formalism is like an infectious disease that is completed horizontally. After convergence, synchronization is achieved vertically, ultimately transmitting pressure to the most basic levels. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The &quot;meaning&quot; of formalism&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Formalism refers to the phenomenon that in the process of administrative management, managers pay too much attention to form and procedures and ignore the substantive work content and effects. , the interesting phenomenon that &quot;formalism always automatically tends to involution&quot; actually contains two levels of problems: the &quot;administrative authority confirmation&quot; of superiors to subordinates and the &quot;pseudo-busyness&quot; of subordinates to superiors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called &quot;administrative authority confirmation&quot; refers to the phenomenon of higher-level management departments confirming their authority to lower-level departments or units through various &quot;forms&quot;. In addition to the familiar cultural exchanges, there are also The bureaucracy that requires &quot;accounting of everything and leaving traces everywhere&quot; and the &quot;proceduralism&quot; that requires setting up power levels for all relevant departments in simple procedures, ultimately making it cumbersome. In addition, there are catwalks, landscaping, and throwing. Pots and various other styles. The most typical one is the endless repetition of &quot;inspections&quot; and &quot;audits&quot;, which turns the process of superiors&#39; normal exercise of supervisory powers over subordinates into a kind of obedience test. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, the authority of the superior needs to be confirmed through this &quot;obedience test&quot; again and again, while the subordinate can only choose unconditional obedience to pass the &quot;test&quot;. This process must be very long. Volume, because &quot;inferior&quot; in form means &quot;inferior&quot; in authority, which is unacceptable to the management department, so naturally the departments mentioned above naturally compete with each other in terms of form. &quot;Lateral involution&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Pseudo busyness&quot; is a response to &quot;formal confirmation of authority&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the process of &quot;formal confirmation of authority&quot; by superiors to subordinates through obedience tests, the grassroots are on the surface The unconditional object in this test of obedience is the unquestionable victim. But if you carefully observe the reaction of the grassroots, you will find that they are not a completely passive party. &quot;Pseudo busyness&quot; is a negative response to &quot;formal confirmation of authority&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called pseudo-busyness refers to being overly busy in grassroots work that is inconsistent with the workload, or simply pretending to be busy, but in fact no substantial progress or results have been achieved. This kind of pseudo-busyness cannot effectively promote work or bring substantial work results, because it is not based on the endogenous willingness to perform duties, but a passive busy state influenced by the external environment. It emphasizes not the execution and completion of the work itself, but the working status of the worker, tending to deliberately create and show a busy working status. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, there are two types of &quot;pseudo-busyness&quot;. One is the proactive pseudo-busyness of &quot;looking for something to do&quot;, and the other is the &quot;pseudo-busyness&quot; shown in dealing with inspections and reviews by superiors. Passive and pseudo-busy.” The purpose of the former is to reduce the frequency and scale of such &quot;obedience tests&quot; by pretending to be busy. The purpose of the latter is to pass this obedience test by showing a high degree of &quot;obedience&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As mentioned above, &quot;formal confirmation of authority&quot; is essentially a test of obedience, in which superiors confirm their absolute dominance over subordinates through some forms that have no practical meaning. The only reason for doing this is simply to prove that you have the right to do so, and this meaningless behavior is usually labeled as a test of organizational and execution capabilities. No matter what kind of test it is, the final performance is that subordinates are busy for an order from their superiors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After subordinates master this &quot;mystery&quot;, they will naturally tend to use &quot;pseudo-busyness&quot; to pass the superior&#39;s obedience test. If the degree of &quot;pseudo-busyness&quot; is not as good as that of others, it means that the degree of obedience is not as good as that of others. This will inevitably lead to some kind of involution of &quot;busy&quot;, that is, &quot;you are busy, I am busier than you&quot;. In the power hierarchy of the entire administrative agency, the higher you go up to the grassroots level, the more levels you face and the more departments you face. Therefore, the grassroots level must be the place where &quot;pseudo-busyness&quot; is most severely involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As educational institutions, the primary and secondary schools mentioned at the beginning of this article face many management levels and many management departments. It is not surprising that they have been pushed to the &quot;extreme&quot;, and similar departments include streets and communities. , and the reason why they are &quot;rolled&quot; is similar, that is, they are all at the lowest level of power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As mentioned above, whether it is &quot;formal confirmation of authority&quot; or &quot;pseudo busyness&quot;, no matter how serious and meticulous he appears, this kind of busyness that does not have the purpose of work itself is impossible. Bringing corresponding governance efficiency will instead become an important negative phenomenon in grassroots governance, affecting the output of governance efficiency, increasing the burden on grassroots staff, and causing low efficacy, work burnout, and even more serious psychological problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 23:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[大学上课“务必前排就坐”，你同意吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260968]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-20 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, the phenomenon of &quot;students not sitting in the front row&quot; inspected by colleges and universities in many places has triggered heated discussions on the Internet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 12, the official website of Changchun University stated that students should be educated and guided to &quot;must sit in the front row.&quot; Those who are absent from class or violate classroom disciplines and refuse to change will be punished in accordance with the relevant provisions of the &quot;Changchun University Student Disciplinary Punishment Regulations&quot; Disciplinary Actions.

The so-called selling an official position to win a title has been around since ancient times, and history is endless. But what we are talking about here is not the behind-the-scenes operation in the house of cards, but the aboveboard state behavior. Starting from the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties, the government sometimes publicly sold official qualifications to solve financial difficulties. In the middle of the Ming Dynasty, Emperor Jingtai, who ascended the throne because his brother Yingzong was captured by the Mongols during the Civil War, put the qualifications of students from the Guozijian, the country&#39;s highest institution (historically known as &quot;Jiansheng&quot;) on the market for the first time, starting an epoch-making revolution. great changes. Because as long as the supervisory students pass a certain period of probation and do not receive negative reviews, they can obtain official qualifications. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the Ming Dynasty&#39;s move was far ahead of the previous generation, it was nothing compared to the Qing Dynasty. The Ming Dynasty only allowed donations from prison students and did not dare to directly sell formal official positions. In the Qing Dynasty, for donations, Beijing officials could donate to doctors of the fifth rank, while foreign officials could only donate to Taoist priests of the fourth rank. The so-called heyday of Kangxi and Qianlong, that is, the two dynasties of Kangxi and Qianlong, were precisely the critical periods for the development of donations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Donations in the Qing Dynasty were divided into two types: &quot;current regulations&quot; and &quot;temporary regulations&quot;. The so-called &quot;current routine&quot; refers to the donations that are offered all year round, mainly to donations to supervising students. During the Qianlong period, the annual income from this was about 3 million taels, which was close to one-tenth of the agricultural tax, which was the main part of the fiscal revenue. The &quot;temporary cases&quot; are used to raise specific funds caused by major events such as military expenses, Yellow River management project expenses, disaster relief funds, etc. Temporary donations mainly sell actual official positions, so they are also called &quot;real official donations.&quot; Legally speaking, those who are eligible to report temporary donations are limited to current officials and supervisory students who already have official qualifications, and ordinary people are excluded. But in fact, if ordinary people want to buy an official position, they can first donate a prison student according to the current regulations, thus perfectly avoiding the restrictions. The income from temporary cases can reach tens of millions of taels at a time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Qing government’s donation information is open and transparent, prices are clearly marked, first come, first served, no one is deceived. There is no age limit for those who wish to donate. Newborn babies can also be donated to supervising children, or on this basis, they can donate to official positions. Because there are far more people qualified to hold official positions than there are bureaucratic positions, it is not possible to get an official position right away. You have to submit relevant documents from the Ministry of Personnel and wait in line to &quot;get on the train&quot; according to order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that they have paid for it, everyone hopes to become a Shangguan as soon as possible and get back their capital and profits as soon as possible. This brought additional business opportunities to the Qing government. Donors could add &quot;tricks&quot; to their donation, that is, priority in appointments, which was equivalent to walking in the VIP channel when queuing. There are many types of products, such as &quot;first use&quot;, &quot;use in case of shortage&quot;, &quot;first use first&quot;, etc., which can be chosen by customers with different needs, all with clearly marked prices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This transaction of the Qing government has undergone some interesting changes as time has passed. On the one hand, official positions are constantly on sale. For example, in the 39th year of Qianlong&#39;s reign (1774), the price of a Taoist was 16,400 taels. In the second year of Xianfeng&#39;s reign (1852), it was reduced to 9,446.4 taels, almost cut in half. By the 27th year of Guangxu&#39;s reign (1901), it only cost 4,732.1 taels, which was more than 30% off. Low. This is because more and more people are queuing up and the backlog is getting worse. For example, in the 19th year of Jiaqing (1814), in order to raise the cost of regulating the eastern Henan section of the Yellow River, the imperial court launched the &quot;Eastern Henan Case&quot;. However, the &quot;Sichuan-Chu Case&quot; 16 years ago, the &quot;Work Relief Case&quot; 13 years ago, and the &quot;Work Relief Case&quot; 11 years ago The &quot;work balance case&quot; before, the &quot;donation case&quot; 8 years ago, and the &quot;earth excavation case&quot; 6 years ago are all still not digested by people who buy government offices. In this case, waiting in line means that the time it takes for the investment to pay off is getting longer and longer. In order to attract new customers, in addition to lowering prices, the imperial court also invented the method of &quot;suppressing the old with the new&quot; (three new and one old, four new and one old, or even five new and one old). For the government, the temporary cases that have ended have already put money firmly into their pockets. Of course, they cannot turn their backs and abandon the consumers who paid for them and are still queuing up. However, in order to recruit new people, the interests of old customers are expendable. Therefore, in the 19th year of Jiaqing, the imperial court announced the implementation of &quot;four new and one old&quot;, that is, for every five vacant official positions reserved for donors, the first four were designated for the East Henan Province, and the fifth was assigned to many previous Persons left unresolved by the case. In these cases, priority is given not to the buyers of the earliest &quot;Chuanchu cases&quot; who paid, but to the consumers of the latest &quot;Tufang cases&quot;. The fifth vacancy, which was the first official position reserved for the old case, was assigned to the top remaining donor in the &quot;Earthwork Case&quot;. As for the &quot;Chuan Chu Case&quot; 16 years ago, the person who finally reached the top of the team had to wait until the 45th place to take the turn. Until the first year of Xianfeng (1851), more than fifty years had passed since the opening of &quot;Chuanchu Case&quot;, and there were still customers queuing up. It is unknown how many people who were excited because of the opportunity to spend money to buy an official position passed away in the long years without waiting for their dreams to come true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, as a VIP channel, the price of tricks is always strong. For example, in the &quot;Zhenggong Case&quot; in the 13th year of Guangxu&#39;s reign (1887), the magistrate&#39;s price was only 1,998 taels, which was half the price during the Qianlong period. However, the magistrate&#39;s &quot;Before the Deficiency&quot; trick required 3,808.8 taels, which was almost double the qualifications for the magistrate&#39;s appointment. . But the same goes for old tricks. For example, if the &quot;first in case of shortage&quot; purchased by &quot;Earthwork Case&quot; is still in the queue when the &quot;East Yun Case&quot; is implemented, its effectiveness will be greatly faded compared to the &quot;first in case of shortage&quot; in &quot;East Yu Case&quot;. In order to do everything possible to mobilize the enthusiasm of consumers and extract money from the hands of the people, the imperial court creatively designed an incentive mechanism of &quot;adding more money to pay for work&quot;. Assume that the magistrate of &quot;Earthwork Case&quot; &quot;in case of shortage&quot; sells for 5,000 taels, and the magistrate of &quot;Eastern Yudong Case&quot; needs &quot;in case of shortage&quot; for 7,000 taels. The person who originally bought the &quot;Earthwork Case&quot; in the county of &quot;in case of shortage&quot; can According to the standard of adding 30 taels for every one hundred taels, and paying an additional 2,100 taels as over-shift fee, you can be transferred to the &quot;first in line&quot; VIP channel of the magistrate of &quot;Eastern Yudong Case&quot; to queue up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a result, donors who have not bought anything actually have no hope of being ranked. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, &quot;pressing the old with the new&quot; also changed from sorting by new and old examples to sorting by new and old patterns. Moreover, the imperial court considered that no matter whether they bought an official position or passed the imperial examination in ten years, it was everyone&#39;s wish to become an official as soon as possible. Those who qualified for official positions through the imperial examination could also open a special channel as long as they were willing to spend money to buy tricks. In the late Guangxu Dynasty, the &quot;Selection of Wheels&quot;, which records the waiting list for county magistrates, contains more than 20 tricks, among which there are &quot;donating and accepting Jinshi first&quot; - a trick specially prepared for Jinshi to &quot;jump in line&quot;, and &quot;donating and accepting filial piety&quot;. &quot;Fangzhengxian&quot; - Xiaolian Fangzheng refers to a person who is qualified to serve as an official because of his outstanding conduct and special recommendation. If such a person does not spend money to buy tricks, no matter how he practices filial piety, no matter how upright his character is, I am afraid he will not be accepted. It&#39;s time to take the wheel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to raise funds, there were still many links in the appointment process of officials in the Qing Dynasty that could be solved with money. At least since the Han Dynasty, people who have just entered the ranks of the bureaucracy may need a period of time as a transitional internship period. After the probation period is completed, they can be officially appointed. In the Qing Dynasty, an internship period ranging from one to three years was generally required before becoming an official for the first time. If you have money, you can donate to get a free trial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When appointing officials in previous dynasties, there were regulations to avoid the place of origin and relatives&#39; official appointments, and the same was true in the Qing Dynasty. However, in the Qing Dynasty, donations could also be waived for avoidance. Even if you designate the province where you want to be an official, or if you are not satisfied with the province where you are appointed as an official and want to change it to another province, you can do it through donations (the former is called a province, and the latter is called changing a province). In the Qing Dynasty, some official positions were under the control of local governors. Candidates could only be appointed within the province. They could also donate a sum of money to leave the province and then donate to another province to switch to another province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Officials appointed by the Ministry of Personnel, ranging from Taoist officials to Qipin Zhizhiguan magistrates (Taoist officials and above are appointed by the emperor), must appear before the emperor and be reviewed by the emperor himself (called an introduction, in fact Often just a formality) before being allowed to take office. As for junior officials such as junior deputies, who were not even close to sesame seeds, the emperor really did not have the time and energy to deal with them, so he commissioned the princes and ministers to check the appearance of each person (called inspection). The purpose of this was to show that the Qing monarch was &quot;arbitrary&quot; and &quot;all employing people, listening to words, and having great power without any excuse.&quot; But as long as you pay for it, introductions and inspections can be dispensed with - even if it&#39;s just for money, you don&#39;t need authority! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to prevent donors from digging too much into the Qing Dynasty, it was originally stipulated that donors with backgrounds should not be recommended by local governors or central ministerial officials (that is, recommended, and the recommender is jointly and severally liable). He cannot serve as a capital official or local official (top leader). In the Qing Dynasty, they even risked their lives for money, and recommendations can also be donated! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Except for those who are entering the official service for the first time, officials who have resigned due to illness and want to return to their original posts after recovering from illness will have to spend a sum of money to replace them immediately, otherwise they will have to wait in line. If you want to change a position, you have to make two investments, first donate to fill the original position, and then donate to replace the position. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most amazing example is probably the &quot;temporary supervisor&quot;: &quot;Some people want to take the examination, but they are not qualified. By donating one supervisor, you can take the provincial examination, but if the supervisor can make a temporary donation in cash , it also requires dozens of taels of silver, and I am not sure whether it will be successful or not. I am a little reluctant to spend dozens of taels of silver in vain. Moreover, if all the procedures for this kind of donation to supervise students are completed, it will be possible. It took quite a while. So this temporary method was devised. First, a dozen or so taels of silver were handed over to the Imperial College, and the prison would issue a temporary supervisory license (commonly known as a supervisory license). With this license, you can Apply for the Provincial Examination in the Ministry of Rites. If you win the exam in the future, you will have to pay the full fee, and the prison will receive the official license. If you fail to pass, it will be considered as a matter of course, and you will make a cash donation until the next Provincial Examination.&quot; (Qi Rushan&#39;s &quot; Chinese family name&quot;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/E9nBwpbi0PRujzZ6WJFwmdGjvoyB5H6l0WZ2LcK3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width =&quot;549&quot; height=&quot;1222&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/E9nBwpbi0PRujzZ6WJFwmdGjvoyB5H6l0WZ2LcK3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258824&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Receipt stub from a donation to a prison student in the 17th year of Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty (1837). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Donations are not only allowed in many aspects of examination qualifications, official qualifications and official appointment, but also after becoming an official Rewards and punishments are due based on performance - if you do well, you can be promoted, if you do poorly, you will be punished - or you can pay for it. In order to open up financial avenues, starting from the Kangxi Dynasty, not only current officials could donate money to be promoted, but also those waiting in line at the Ministry of Civil Service for appointment could donate money in advance. For example, in the Yimao donation in the 14th year of Kangxi&#39;s reign (1675), a candidate for the county magistrate (deputy of the county magistrate) could pay 300 taels for &quot;first use&quot;, or he could spend 1,000 taels to donate to the county magistrate&#39;s official qualifications. If he was willing to pay an additional 500 taels You can directly enter the &quot;first use&quot; VIP channel of the county magistrate. This system is unique to the Qing Dynasty. After current officials spend money to buy promotion qualifications, they can theoretically queue up at the Ministry of Civil Affairs only after their current term of office expires. Considering that this would dampen the enthusiasm of consumers, the Qing government also launched the donation of resignation, so that as long as you pay for it, you can leave immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can use money to get a promotion, you can be punished for dereliction of duty, or you can spend money to eliminate disasters. In the Qing Dynasty, depending on the content and degree of the fault committed by an official, there were three types of punishment: fine, demotion, and dismissal. Under normal circumstances, only “set-off” or “recovery” can reduce or reduce the penalty. The so-called &quot;offset&quot; refers to officials using the rewards they receive to offset punishment. There are two types of awards: &quot;Additional Level&quot; and &quot;Record&quot;. &quot;Additional one level&quot; or four &quot;records&quot; can be used to offset the penalty of downgrading by one level. &quot;The second record will offset the penalty for one year, and the first record will offset the penalty for half a year.&quot; &quot;Rehabilitate&quot; means that the punishment can be lifted after a certain period of time if the person behaves well. For example, the reinstatement period for those who were demoted and retained in office is three years, and the period for those who were dismissed and retained in office is four years. If you perform meritorious services during this period, you may be reinstated in advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both &quot;Additional Levels&quot; and &quot;Records&quot; can be purchased publicly for money. However, the Qing Dynasty stipulated that for the &quot;increased level&quot; or &quot;record&quot; of donations to be used for offset, the payment must have been received before the disciplinary incident was reported. If you go to buy something after being punished, it will be too late. Therefore, before officials took office, they donated Naga level and records. Beginning in the 14th year of Kangxi&#39;s reign, officials were allowed to directly spend money to cancel the punishment after being punished. All officials who have been demoted and retained in office, or dismissed and retained in office (remaining in their original posts after being demoted or dismissed), except for a few exceptions, can donate to reinstatement officers. Officials who should have been demoted (reassigned work according to the downgraded grade) or dismissed, but who were retained in office due to leniency orders, can pay a 50% increase in salary upon reinstatement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to donating to restore the official position, you can also donate to restore the position corresponding to the grade of the original official. This is called &quot;replacement donation&quot;. Retired officials can also donate to a position lower than the original official, which is called &quot;reduced donation&quot;. After the donation is made, there is still an opportunity to donate again to reinstate the official or change the donation, which is equivalent to payment in installments. Officials who have been dismissed from their posts, even if they are &quot;never employed&quot;, can still become officials again through donations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar to buying an official position, donating money is clearly marked with a clear price and is straightforward. The price of being demoted and staying in office, from the first to the seventh rank, is twice that of a Beijing official. For example, a first-rank Beijing official is 450 taels, and a second-rank official is 410 liang. A first-rank foreign official is 900 liang, and a second-rank official is 820 liang. The eighth and ninth grades are subject to the unified price of Beijing and foreign officials. The price of donations for those who were dismissed and retained in office was not only much higher, but also more detailed. For the same grade, officials in the capital charged higher prices than officials in foreign countries. For officials who are demoted, transferred or dismissed, the price can be doubled compared to those who were demoted and retained or dismissed. In addition, depending on the specific circumstances of different officials, there is a complex price increase mechanism, ranging from an increase of 20% (20%) to an increase of one and a half times (150%). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the Qing Dynasty, due to widespread financial difficulties in local areas, the imperial court often allowed each province to set up local donations. This resulted in an unintended consequence - inter-provincial competition. In order to expand revenue as much as possible, each province not only accepts donations from residents of other provinces living in the province, but also sets up donation bureaus (sales offices) in major cities outside the province to drum up business, even at the expense of small profits but quick turnover, &quot;reduced (discounted) donations&quot; , starting a price war. At one point, Sichuan and other provinces protested against &quot;dumping&quot; by Gansu and Shaanxi and demanded that the central government prohibit people from their provinces from going to other provinces to report donations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Ciming, a famous scholar in the late Qing Dynasty and a native of Zhejiang, went to the Fujian Donation Bureau to apply for donations in the ninth year of Xianfeng (1859). The price was 9684 taels, and the actual receipt was 815 taels, which was less than 10%. This is a common practice in various provinces: &quot;Henan Province takes rate notes (notes issued by the Ministry of Household Affairs to settle military arrears) and adds 10% in cash, which is about 20%. Huguang, Sichuan, and Zhejiang account for about 10%. The third. Jiangxi and Guangxi account for about three-tenths of the tenths. Yunnan and Guizhou account for about two-tenths. Anhui fully collects rates, accounting for about one-tenth. The remaining provinces do not have more than 30%.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;In Chengdu at the end of the Qing Dynasty, in addition to the Sichuan Relief Bureau (disaster relief) in the province, there were also the Xinhai Defense Donation Bureau (organizing the navy), the Feng (Liaoning) Donation Bureau, the Gui Donation Bureau, the Jiangnan Donation Bureau, and the Shandong Works Relief Donation Bureau (raising funds for Work-relief funds) and the Beiyang Salary and Donation Bureau (Beiyang Military Salary), etc. At that time, newspapers had just been born, and due to fierce competition, some discerning donation bureaus had already learned to publish advertisements. In this situation where there are many donation bureaus and a mixture of good and bad, there is also a phenomenon that some people conduct credit evaluations on different donation bureaus in publicly issued books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because there are so many types of tricks and there are so many donation bureaus, most people are easily confused, so an intermediary agency was born that specializes in handling donations, with a commission of about 10%. Many gold shops have &quot;transformed into a gathering place for donors and introductions&quot; and have dedicated &quot;donation counters&quot; to handle donations. Gold shops with donation counters are called &quot;public gold shops&quot;, while gold shops without donation counters are called &quot;mother gold shops&quot;. There will be competition among gold shops, and they will also use various means to deceive customers, which is no different from today&#39;s real estate agencies. Everyone knows the prosperity of Shanxi banknotes in the late Qing Dynasty, but few people have noticed that agency donations are one of the keys to the great development of Shanxi banknotes.

According to the Anhui Radio and Television Economic Life Channel, a 4-year-old boy in Hefei, Anhui, Wang Zien, had no one to take care of him and played alone on the street all day long. In order to settle Wang Zien&#39;s residence, the child&#39;s father, 18-year-old Wang, finally showed up. He said that he was only 14 years old when Wang Zien was born, and the child&#39;s mother was 20 years old at the time. The two parties broke up a few months after the child was born, and there has been no contact. He had to leave the child to his father to raise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident broke out, public opinion mainly focused on Wang giving birth to a child before the age of 14. He was still a child, which was too irresponsible, and the mother of the child was more likely to be suspected of abandoning the child. A lawyer interviewed by the media said that the mother should fulfill her parenting obligations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These angles cannot be said to be meaningless, but they obviously miss the point. The crux of the problem should be that boys&#39; sexual rights are not protected. According to Wang, he was only 14 years old when the child was born (I don’t know whether he was one year old or not, even if he was one year old, Wang was probably still under 14 years old when they had sex), and the child’s mother was 20 years old. It can be inferred that when having sexual relations, Wang was most likely under 14 years old, while the mother of the child was over 18 years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What will happen if the genders are reversed and an 18-year-old man has sex with a girl under 14? I&#39;m afraid online public opinion has already exploded. According to the criminal law, sexual relations with a girl under the age of 14, regardless of whether the girl &quot;consented&quot;, will be severely punished as rape. If the circumstances are serious or cause serious consequences, the death penalty may also be imposed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, when the genders are reversed and adult women have sex with underage men, the situation becomes very embarrassing. The crime of rape cannot be applied because China&#39;s criminal law stipulates that the victim of rape can only be a female. Even if a man is forced to have sex, the other party does not commit the crime of rape. If the boy is under 14 when he is violated, he can be punished as child molestation. However, the penalty for this crime is only a fixed-term imprisonment of less than 5 years. Even if there are bad circumstances or serious consequences, the maximum sentence can only be 15 years in prison. This is not the same as the punishment for rape. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the male victim is over 14 years old, he is no longer a child. Even if he is forcibly violated, criminal law cannot protect his rights. More importantly, in reality, if a minor male has sexual relations with a female, if the other party is an adult, judicial practice will not consider the male&#39;s sexual rights to have been violated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is obviously abnormal. Minor males should receive the same protection as minor females. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Quite coincidentally, a case of an adult female teacher sexually assaulting an underage male student recently broke out in Taiwan. Xu, a female teacher who works as a fifth- and sixth-grade primary school teacher, repeatedly sexually assaulted a boy under the age of 14 in her class. She eventually became pregnant and gave birth to a child. The crime was later reported. The judge recently ruled that Xu was guilty of sexual intercourse and forced intercourse with a man under the age of 14, and sentenced her to 17 years and six months in prison. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Analyzing this case, we can find the differences between Taiwan’s criminal laws and mainland criminal laws. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, having sex with a man against his will also constitutes the crime of rape (called &quot;forced intercourse&quot; in Taiwan). According to the criminal regulations revised in Taiwan in 1999, &quot;Men and women who have sexual intercourse by force, coercion, intimidation, hypnosis or other methods against their will shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than 3 years but not more than 10 years.&quot; In this case, The judge determined that the female teacher surnamed Xu had sex with a male student twice against the male student&#39;s will, so it constituted a crime of forced intercourse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, as long as you have sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 14, even if the child is voluntary, it still constitutes a crime (Article 227 of the Criminal Code of Taiwan, &quot;Any person who has sexual intercourse with a man or woman under the age of 14 shall be punished with 3 to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than 10 years but not more than 10 years”). In the above-mentioned case, the judge held that the female teacher named Xu had sexual intercourse with male students on seven other occasions. Although the boys were consenting, Xu&#39;s use of the girl still constituted the crime of sexual intercourse with men under the age of 14. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Taiwan’s criminal regulations also equally protect the sexual rights of minors of men and women over 14 years old but under 16 years old. “Anyone who has sexual intercourse with a man or woman over 14 years old but under 16 years old shall be sentenced to a fixed-term imprisonment of not more than 7 years.” &quot;. That is to say, having sexual relations with minors between the ages of 14 and 16 is also a crime, but the penalty is lighter than having sexual relations with children under 14 years old. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In mainland criminal law, the protection of men’s sexual rights is much weaker. The sexual rights of minor males over 14 years old (let alone adult males) are not protected by criminal law, and the sexual rights of boys under 14 years old can only be protected by the much weaker crime of child molestation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is another point in Taiwan’s criminal laws that we can learn from, that is, multiple crimes can be punished based on the number of crimes committed, and they can be punished simultaneously. In the above-mentioned case, the judge found that Xu had sex with male students nine times. Although they were only divided into two categories, she was still convicted of nine crimes, and finally she was punished for several crimes. In the mainland legal system, only different crimes will be regarded as multiple crimes, the same crime will be classified as one crime, and the number of crimes will only be used as a reference for sentencing. This may result in a lighter sentence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back at history, before Taiwan revised its criminal laws in 1999, the victims of rape could only be women. If a man was sexually assaulted, the perpetrator could only be held accountable for indecent assault. However, Taiwan revised the relevant regulations more than 20 years ago to provide equal protection for the sexual rights of men and women. This is something the mainland can learn from. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 19:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[黑龙江大庆市肇州发生火灾，致7人死亡]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260964]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-20 19:09:39&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;The reporter learned from the People’s Government of Zhaozhou County, Daqing City, Heilongjiang Province that at 14:00 on November 20, 2023 At 04:00, the county fire brigade received an alarm that a fire broke out in a single-story steel structure simple board house of an individual industrial and commercial household in the south of Shizi Street, Fengle Town, Zhaozhou County.

Many tourist magazines are selected as &quot;one of the most intoxicating vacation destinations in the world&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Now that the price of Bali and eating has increased the price, Fuko said that it was possible to rent a large suite with a swimming pool in Bali. . But after the epidemic is liberalized, the same price can only be rented in a single room. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Even most restaurants have increased prices. In the past, a per capita per capita can be eaten in a good western food in a restaurant with good environment, but now it starts at least 150 yuan. The starting price of motorcycles has doubled from three or four dollars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Zhou Zhao told the southern weekend reporter that for the popular attractions in foreign countries, hotels are generally scheduled to book hotels in about two months in advance, and the price is also an average of about 30%compared to the epidemic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the travel statistics of Bali Province, from November 2022 to January 2023, nearly 1 million foreign tourists in Bali ushered in. According to data released by the Chinese Consulate General in Barcelona, ​​Indonesia, about 40 % of foreign tourists received by Bali Province account for 40 % of foreign tourists visiting Indonesia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Due to the nature of the work, Fuko often goes out to shoot. He bought a motorcycle, but he often had traffic jams on the road, and sometimes even blocked for three or forty minutes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The road is very narrow, a car in the middle, and the motorcycles are stuffed on both sides.&quot; Fuko told the southern weekend that tourists and locals were overlapping. good. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;&quot; src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/6ff705530eg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot; 1080 &quot;height =&quot; 1440 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/6FF705530E.jpeg &quot;data- key =&quot; 258864 &quot;>; &lt;span style =&quot; colorle = &quot;colorle : #999999; text-align: center; &quot;>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999999; text-align: center; &quot;>; Sometimes a short narrow path, sometimes even even Thirty or forty minutes.

The previous 300 yuan can be rented to a motorcycle, and now it is 500 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Zhou Zhao said that this year, due to the energy of most countries&#39; energy from Russia and Ukraine, such as fuel costs, gas costs, electricity costs, etc., the cost of tourism has increased. It is more expensive and stems from this reason. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, for Fuko, the longer it takes to stay in Bali, the decreased the favorability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The gap between the rich and the poor in Bali is large. Some people who depend on the tourism industry have stimulated other people&#39;s desire for money. After the epidemic is liberalized, there are houses in the house, and many of them open homestays or shops. In the past, Most of the people in Bali felt that most of the people in Bali were &quot;simple&quot;, but now the &quot;business taste&quot; is even more heavier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In May this year, a news about &quot;want to make an appointment for a year in Bali to travel in Bali&quot; has attracted the attention of the international community. The source is a report from the Indonesian news website, saying that the Bali of the tourist destinations plans to implement restrictions on foreign tourists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Subsequently, the governor of Bali Province Wan Yang explained to the media and implemented restricted measures, mainly to avoid some foreign tourists staying in the local area after spending on vacation on vacation, illegally doing business or job hunting. In addition, with the recovery of tourism after the epidemic, large -scale tourists have arrived, and there are also some violations of law and disrespect to local culture, &quot;leading to restlessness in Bali residents.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For this plan, Fuko believes that it is &quot;difficult to implement.&quot; Because in Bali, &quot;money is king.&quot; He said that both the government and the public want to develop the economy. The so -called &quot;application restrictions&quot;, as long as the money is in place, is a small problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Fuko said that even if it really landed, the price would not fall to the conventional level. &quot;Because these policies are essentially to screen tourists and have better economic and more stable tourists.&quot; Fuko believes that this can make more money from tourists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, the following month, the deputy minister of the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economics of Indonesia, Ayu Martini, said that as of now, Bali tourism does not need to make an appointment, and Indonesia&#39;s visa policy has not changed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the relevant plans formulated by the Indonesian government, Indonesia strives to receive 3.5 million to 7.4 million international tourists in 2023, and foreign exchange revenue in the tourism industry has reached at least 2.07 billion US dollars. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; &quot;The key lies in passenger flow management&quot; &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In addition to admiring the city&#39;s landscape, the number of tourists surprised him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;In the local area, the faces of different countries can be seen everywhere.&quot; Chen Zhiwei said that the most common transportation of the transportation of Venice is the bus ship, and each ship is always full of people. &quot;From morning to night.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Venice, this beautiful city known as the &quot;city of water&quot;, is located in the Aristilia Sea in northeastern Italy.

The picture shows tourists on a Big -bonlason cruise in Venice. (Yao Jiatong/Picture) &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But the conflict occurred. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Once, when Chen Zhiwei played in Bisa, he was told that the last train was temporarily canceled at the train station. Because hundreds of locals and foreign tourists were left at the scene, the railway station sent a return bus, but only 40 people could take 40 people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At the beginning, the staff asked tourists with children to get on the car first, but quickly caused the dissatisfaction of the locals who could not get on. Can&#39;t sit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Many local people are around the bus to prevent drivers from driving away.&quot; Chen Zhiwei said that whoever got on the car and who left became the fuse of contradictions and conflicts. After the local and tourists had physical conflicts, many police officers were dispatched to solve it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Finally, many tourists including Chen Zhiwei can only spend the night at the train station and wait for the train the next morning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On September 13, 2023, Venice announced a policy, that is, starting from the spring of 2024. If tourists are not overnight, tourists entering the city during the peak will need to pay 5 euros (about about 5 euros (about about 39 yuan). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Previously, the Venice government hoped that the money would be used to improve the facilities and infrastructure of residents. Because they &quot;had to deal with overflowing trash bins&quot; and trash thrown on the street. During the peak, the number of foreign tourists is about five times that of locals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Chen Zhiwei is accustomed to similar &quot;taxes&quot;. For example, when living in the hotel, many hotels will receive &quot;urban taxes&quot;, usually two or three euros a day, and will be displayed on the bill. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;After the money is collected, it is actually used to help maintain the city and deal with the problem of tourism derived.&quot; Chen Zhiwei said that while foreign tourists come to tourism, it is reasonable to bear some maintenance costs. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Outside public opinion believes that excessive tourism has led many locals to leave their hometown. The introduction of taxes and fees such as &quot;tourism tax&quot; can offset harmful effects such as waste resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;&quot; src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/88EAC1ABE8.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot; 1080 &quot;height =&quot; 720 &quot;data-src =&quot; // images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/88eac1abe8.jpg &quot;data- key =&quot; 258866 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p STYLE = &quot;COLOR: #999999; Text-Align: Center;&quot;>; Many netizens &quot;spit&quot; on social platforms, and it is difficult to stop for international online celebrity tourist attractions.

The locals told him that the purpose of this was to prevent tourists and nomads sleeping on the bench and reducing their stay in the public area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Like Venice, Croatia also introduced &quot;rules&quot; or explained to tourists to prevent non -obedient behavior related to drinking. This includes wearing appropriate clothing in regions in history, prohibiting drinking and gathering in public places where drinking is prohibited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The director of the North American Ministry of Croatian National Tourism Administration, Ena Robin, said that the code of conduct is a acceptable way to inform tourists&#39; expectations. &quot;But it is usually limited in compliance.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;&quot; src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/043a1631e0.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot; 1080 &quot;height =&quot; 1620 &quot;data-src =&quot; // images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/043a1631e0.jpg &quot;data- key =&quot; 258867 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p STYLE = &quot;COLOR: #999999; Text-Align: Center;&quot;>; There are many places to set &quot;rules&quot; or explain to prevent non-observant behavior.

Over the years, huge passenger flows have caused serious problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The Secretary -General of the United Nations World Tourism Organization, Zulab Polor Kashvi, said in an interview that the key to solving excessive tourism is the management of passenger flow. He pointed out that new technologies can help solve this problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For example, in northern Germany, the laser radar sensor installed on a self -driving car is managed to manage tourist traffic.

Resolve differences peacefully, avoid escalation of the situation, and take practical and effective measures to ensure security and stability on the China-Myanmar border. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 8, the Myanmar National Governing Council (junta) held a meeting of the National Defense Committee. The Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar Army, General Min Aung Hlaing, made it clear at the meeting that the attack launched by the Kokang Allied Forces was intended to retake the Kokang. control and regain the benefits of drug production and trafficking, while its allies, the Ta&#39;ang Army and the Kachin Independence Army, also have their own political goals. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Chaos in northern Myanmar, the impact of &quot;making quick money&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Northern Myanmar has been in a state of war for a long time, with a large number of ethnic minority local armed forces, Myanmar government forces and minorities recruited by the government forces. The militia groups transformed from ethnic local armed forces are fighting with each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the main contradiction exists between the local armed forces of ethnic minorities and the government forces, under certain circumstances, some ethnic minority armed forces will cooperate with the government forces to a certain extent to target other ethnic minority armed forces. ; In some cases, the militia groups recruited by the government forces will turn against the government forces again, so that on the one hand, the government forces need to rely on the support of the militia groups as local people to deal with the local militias; on the other hand, they also maintain a high degree of vigilance against the militia groups, everywhere Limit it to prevent it from getting too big. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The causes of Myanmar’s civil war are long-standing and complex. This involves the need to face the ethnic chieftain system left over from the feudal dynasty in the construction of the Myanmar nation-state, as well as the British colonists&#39; political tactics of strengthening support for ethnic chieftains and countering the majority Bamar ethnic group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What cannot be ignored is that in the 1960s, after launching a coup and seizing state power, Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar Army Ne Win adopted an impatient attitude in building a nation-state and tried to divide the national identity into three Sixty-nine and so on, forcibly promoting the assimilation of ethnic minorities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the area where ethnic minorities occupy nearly half of Myanmar’s territory, dozens of ethnic minorities who have lived here for generations suddenly became second- and third-class citizens overnight, and even their national identity cannot be guaranteed. What they lose is not only political rights, but also the most basic land property rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To this day, this attitude of &quot;the land is important but not the people&quot;, which has not been completely changed, is the most fundamental reason for the armed resistance of ethnic minorities in northern and southeastern Myanmar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Myanmar is not a developed country, and areas inhabited by ethnic minorities such as northern Myanmar are even more remote and underdeveloped. The long-term consumption of war has completely complicated the problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the Burmese Army recognizes the legitimacy of their political status, in reality, the Burmese Army’s military expenditures are not generous, and the supply of their weapons, equipment and personnel costs is basically better than nothing, which often leads them to “use drugs” &quot;Raise the Army&quot; route. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Burmese army often adopts a indulgent attitude towards this. If controls are strengthened, it is easy for the vigilante groups to rebel again and become local militants. If the vigilante group collapses immediately, he will also lose a powerful arm. Therefore, this delicate balance is also an important reason for the rampant criminal activities in northern Myanmar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the shortage of military funds, the income of the military and police at the grassroots level of the Myanmar government is too low. At the beginning of 2021, a &quot;nest case&quot; occurred in Tachileik, a city in northern Myanmar, in which some military and police collaborated to shelter drug trafficking. For this reason, Myanmar The military government had to make major changes to the local military and police departments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The huge profits of drugs are also the reason why the &quot;alternative cultivation&quot; model that the international community once seriously promoted has made occasional progress in northern Myanmar, but has always had little effect. If we can find another way to &quot;make quick money&quot; that is not so eye-catching to the world and is as profitable as the drug trade, this will be quite attractive to various ethnic groups. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, in the past ten years, when &quot;online gambling&quot; was hit hard again, it quickly turned into widespread electronic fraud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, on the one hand, the Kokang Allied Forces will indeed deal a heavy blow to the electronic fraud problem in northern Myanmar; on the other hand, it may also make the future situation in Myanmar more complicated. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Each one has his or her own agenda&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Although the Kokang area is only a tiny corner of the country compared to the whole of Myanmar, judging from the scope of this war, it is obviously beyond The scope of boldness. Not to mention that the direct goal of the Allied Forces is to regain control of the Kokang region. As allies of the Allied Forces, the Ta&#39;ang Army, Arakan Army, People&#39;s Protection Army (PDF) and Kachin Army, their demands are obviously not to combat electronic fraud. But for its own benefit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Ta&#39;ang Army is fighting for a controlled area around Muse City in Myanmar, and may be able to achieve a status similar to today&#39;s Wa State in the future; the Arakan Army and the Kachin Army are pursuing in Rakhine State and Kachin State to establish an independent country; and the People&#39;s Protection Army (PDF)&#39;s primary goal is to overthrow the military regime throughout Myanmar...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the Allied Forces recapture Kokang, it may become a landmark event, prompting other civilian armed organizations to Political desires are rising again. In addition to the civilian armed organizations that have not signed the &quot;Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement&quot; with the Burmese army, other organizations that have signed the agreement and even those that have accepted the reorganization of the Burmese army into &quot;border defense battalions&quot; may again There is a change of situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is undeniable that the current relative strength gap between the Myanmar Army and the above-mentioned organizations is the biggest driving force for them to unite and cooperate in combat. There is no doubt that this has indeed caused considerable pressure on the Myanmar Army. It is worth noting that the political demands of various local armed forces and the People&#39;s Protection Army vary greatly. In the future, internal conflicts may escalate and become prolonged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If a long-term and large-scale war breaks out in Myanmar, not only may traditional security issues such as the dispersion of weapons and the impact of refugee waves occur, but also if the De&#39;ang Army occupies the Muse Port, and considering that the Qingshui River Port has been captured by the Allied Forces, The land trade channel between China and Myanmar will be greatly affected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More importantly, the consumption of war will inevitably stimulate the recurrence of certain phenomena in the &quot;feeding the army with poison&quot;, &quot;feeding the army with gambling&quot; and the current &quot;feeding the army with fraud&quot; that civilian armed groups originally relied on. It may have reared its head, or it may have turned to other more novel models of &quot;black and gray industries&quot; again, causing more complex security issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some local armed groups in northern Myanmar are likely to cause some hidden worries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the phenomenon of &quot;large mixed settlements&quot; of various ethnic groups in northern Myanmar is very common, which will undoubtedly cause them to fall into a series of problems in terms of territory and population management, creating hidden dangers of future conflicts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the natural and human conditions in northern Myanmar are quite limited. If these areas become independent, it will be difficult to form pillar industries other than minerals, and they lack financial self-sustainability. Even if a legal government is established, its stability There will be problems with the country and social governance capabilities. Coupled with the presence of a large number of cross-border ethnic groups in the region, domestic conflicts may eventually spill over and affect regional stability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, the consequences of a divided Myanmar may seriously affect regional stability. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Can it be &quot;crushed&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the past, the reason why the Burmese army was able to crush ethnic armed groups was mainly due to its size and resource advantages in the Burmese areas. , the only obstacle that is not easy to overcome is the geographical situation of civilian areas. This advantage has been greatly weakened after the &quot;2.1 coup&quot; in 2020. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The NLD government has a very strong appeal in Myanmar, especially within the Bamar ethnic group. The coup of the Burmese army caused serious divisions within the Bamar ethnic group and seriously weakened the Burmese army&#39;s war sustainability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Only from a comparison of military strength, the Burmese army can theoretically increase its troops on a large scale in northern Myanmar to solve the danger of the siege of Kokang. However, the current large-scale increase of troops itself will bring considerable risks to the Burmese army. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In areas dominated by the Bamar ethnic group, the People&#39;s Protection Army is already spreading everywhere. Once heavy troops move north to the empty hinterland of Myanmar, how can they not seize this opportunity? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the Burmese army adopts measures such as mobilizing reserves to expand its army first and then move north, there will also be several obstacles: not only will it make the already poor financial situation further difficult, but it may also allow the Baojun and other pro-NLD forces to further infiltrate Within the Tatmadaw, causing more trouble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the Burmese army passively accepts the reality, it will first severely damage the personal prestige of the Burmese army leader. After all, the political capital that started his career was the decisive solution to the Peng Jiasheng armed forces in the &quot;8.8 Incident&quot;; the top brass of the Burmese army If there are changes, it will inevitably have a greater impact on Myanmar&#39;s overall political situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What decision the top brass of the Myanmar military will ultimately make is obviously a question worthy of attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Myanmar, in the future, the Myanmar Army may be able to reach a certain compromise with the ethnic armed groups through political negotiations, and then turn around and focus on targeting the People&#39;s Protection Army. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, the reverse may also be true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Burmese army and the NLD forces reached a compromise, and the People&#39;s Protection Army gradually fell silent. The Burmese army was free to suppress the local armed forces back to the previous state. This could result in a long period of largely barely stable Myanmar, punctuated by minor conflicts. This is also a tragedy for Myanmar itself, which means that the Myanmar people have to endure more pain, but it is better than the situation of the country being divided and losing its autonomy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is another result, which is less likely but still exists, that is, after the Burmese people achieve internal reconciliation, the Burmese army will finally rely on its own size advantage to completely suppress the local armed forces within a certain period of time, at least Unifying the mountains and rivers in form. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the future, the autonomy of ethnic groups in northern Myanmar will be effectively guaranteed, especially the clear division of power between the central government of Myanmar and the local autonomous governments of ethnic minorities, which will ensure the development and development of ethnic minority areas in northern Myanmar. The simultaneous development of Bamar areas is the fundamental move to truly eradicate the source of trouble in this area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this idea is still a castle in the air before today’s political and social reality in Myanmar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 17:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“中华老字号”不是护身符：历史招牌只是其表，商业信誉才是其里丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260947]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-20 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, the Ministry of Commerce and other five departments issued the &quot;Notice on Announcement of the Review Results of Chinese Time-honored Brands&quot;, which will lead to long-term poor management. , or even 55 brands that have gone bankrupt, canceled, closed down, or lost the ownership and use rights of time-honored registered trademarks, have been removed from the list of Chinese time-honored brands; 73 brands with poor operations and declining performance are required to be rectified within 6 months; 1,000 brands will continue to be retained A brand with standardized operations and good development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Chinese time-honored brand&quot; is not only a title/title, but also an officially certified identity/qualification. The &quot;remove, rectify, and retain&quot; measures taken by the five departments to &quot;remove, rectify, and retain&quot; &quot;Chinese time-honored brands&quot; just allow the outside world to rethink the true connotation of &quot;Chinese time-honored brands&quot; and analyze the right and wrong behind &quot;Chinese time-honored brands&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The official definition of the so-called &quot;Chinese time-honored brands&quot; refers to &quot;long history, products, skills or services that have been passed down from generation to generation, with a distinctive traditional Chinese cultural background and profound cultural heritage, and have gained widespread social recognition.&quot; recognition and form a brand with good reputation.” From the literal meaning, &quot;inherited from generation to generation&quot; can be interpreted as &quot;historical and cultural traditional value&quot;, while &quot;products, skills or services are widely recognized by society&quot; can be reduced to &quot;commercial reputation and market status&quot;, which is also the construction of &quot;Chinese time-honored brands&quot;. &quot;Two pillars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The connotation of &quot;Chinese time-honored brands&quot; is the &quot;traditional cultural background and profound cultural heritage&quot; behind it, or is it the market position and business reputation won in competition? The two cases in this notice can be said to be the answer to this question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the &quot;time-honored brands&quot; that have been removed from the list, Inner Mongolia Dashengkui and Anhui Beggar Chicken are two typical cases: Dashengkui lasted for hundreds of years from the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty to the Anti-Japanese War. &quot;Yin Yuan Bao Pu&quot; ruled two thousand miles of trade routes in Mongolia. When it resumed business more than ten years ago, it also placed many people&#39;s expectations on reviving the old brand; Anhui beggar&#39;s chicken is said to date back to the Hongwu period of the Ming Dynasty. Although this legend is false and true , but the reason why it was expelled from the &quot;time-honored brand&quot; is not its historical and cultural authenticity, but its poor management in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to see that the history of Dashengkui is more authentic, but this does not save it from the bad luck of being &quot;delisted&quot;; Anhui Beggar Chicken has doubts about its history and culture alone, but the last thing that crushed it The straw is probably not an academic verification of authenticity, but a defeat in the competition in the modern catering market. In fact, there is more than one &quot;Beggar&#39;s Chicken&quot;. The &quot;Daoxiang Village&quot; and &quot;Guanshengyuan&quot; that have been removed from the list this time also have brands with the same name. The reason why they failed to pass the review of &quot;Chinese Time-honored Brands&quot; is not because of &quot;historical and cultural traditional value&quot; &quot;Something went wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, for these &quot;Chinese time-honored brands&quot;, if they cannot embrace the latest changes in the market and cannot innovate themselves to meet the needs of consumers, they will inevitably die out; conversely, if a brand can Create brand new products and services, and even if they are not old, they will slowly occupy the minds of consumers and become a new tradition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Western academic circles have long noticed the phenomenon of &quot;invention of tradition&quot;: those &quot;traditions&quot; that appear or claim to be ancient often originate quite recently, and are sometimes even invented. . This is not uncommon in the Chinese context, which is the common phenomenon of &quot;replying family trees&quot; and &quot;recognizing ancestors&quot;. The &quot;traditional origins&quot; recognized by many &quot;time-honored brands&quot; are often suspected of being attached to others in academic circles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Facts have proved that whether a tradition really has historical and cultural continuity value and whether it is really academically tenable is not determined by whether the tradition is widely accepted. The key factor is not even important. Regardless of these &quot;time-honored brands&quot;, even emerging companies that have not been established for a long time often have to make some &quot;inventions&quot; and even &quot;legends&quot; in the &quot;brand story&quot;, but no consumer will be like a professional historian. If we continue to delve deeper into how much of this is true and how false, we will be more inclined to spread these wonderful stories. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such cases abound in China, Europe and the United States. The history of &quot;A diamond is forever, a diamond will last forever&quot; is actually not that long ago, but this advertising slogan and the brand value behind it seem to have existed since ancient times. The untenable &quot;tradition&quot; can still win over consumers. The &quot;Eight Major Cuisines&quot; often claim to have thousands of years of history, but their true origins can often only be traced back to the mid-Qing Dynasty. However, this has not affected the reputation of the major cuisines. After all, food must be felt by the tip of the tongue, and consumers I don&#39;t care much about whether its history is true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, this does not mean that the authenticity of &quot;time-honored brands&quot; is not important at all. &quot;Century-old stores&quot; that &quot;look fake at first glance&quot; will still make people see through their tricks, and then be suspected of false propaganda. In other words, only the quality of goods and services, consumer choices, and market judgment can enable a company and its brand to gain business credibility, consolidate the company&#39;s brand value, help companies spread their own brand stories, and let &quot;time-honored&quot; brands The brand stands. If the &quot;old -fashioned&quot; is reduced to the &quot;amulet&quot; of the enterprise, it makes companies feel that they can &quot;lie down&quot; by this, and even rely on the brand&#39;s old masses to not improve business management and do not pay attention to the quality of commodity services, then the famous result and unrealistic result can be realized. I can&#39;t even keep my name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, for a &quot;time-honored enterprise&quot;, the directory and trademark are only the surface, and long-lasting business reputation is the inside. A &quot;old Chinese name&quot; can maintain its business reputation that does not fall, relying on a paper list or a trademark, but consumers&#39; sincere recognition of it as a traditional Chinese brand.

For example, 10 kinds of Xinjiang delicacies, including Xinjiang’s No. 1 Nang, Big Plate of Chicken, Noodle Soup for Ten Thousands of People, Largest Oil Cake Tower, and Rice Pilaf for Ten Thousand People, have all set Guinness World Records for their “bigness”. Compared with milk tea that starts at 2 pounds, It can be regarded as a &quot;baby meal&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Xinjiang&#39;s largest &quot;Aimai&quot; naan has a diameter of 40 to 50 centimeters. It requires 1 kilogram of flour to make. There are patterns stamped in the middle of the naan, and there are chopped onions or sesame seeds. . Nang with meat in a vat, pitted meat with naan, Xinjiang fried rice noodles with naan... Thousands of ways to eat naan, brewing the nostalgic memory of Xinjiang people when they were children waiting for their mother to break off a piece by the naan pit and feed it to their mouths. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The reason why Xinjiang cuisine is so heavy is that Xinjiang people don’t have the concept of kilograms and liangs. What they call “one kilogram” is actually one kilogram. Because of the &quot;bigness&quot; of Xinjiang, they created their own weights and measures - there are 22 airports in one province of Xinjiang. In their eyes, distances within 1,000 kilometers are very close, and 1,000 kilometers is enough to travel from Beijing to Taiyuan and back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition to the large portions, the prices of Xinjiang dishes are also shocking in Northeast China, which is always known for its affordable prices. According to data from Dianping, the top ten restaurants in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, only cost 74 yuan per person, which is lower than the average price in the capitals of the three eastern provinces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is large in area and heavy in weight, and the &quot;imagination&quot; of Xinjiang people is also very big. Many Xinjiang people&#39;s store names reveal a kind of simple humor. A series of store names such as &quot;Sexy Mommy&#39;s Postpartum Recovery Mother and Baby Center&quot; and &quot;Drag and Drive Over&quot; make people laugh. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As an inland province, Xinjiang gives people the impression that it has nothing to do with water. Also because of its &quot;large&quot; territory, Xinjiang has almost all the country&#39;s specialties, such as Salmon production accounts for 15% of inland production. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Xinjiang also has great charm. In the first three quarters of this year, Xinjiang received 213.86 million tourists, a year-on-year increase of 77.73%. Tourists rushed to this western land, came with expectations, and left reluctantly as if they were heartbroken. Xinjiang’s specialty paper-skinned walnuts and Hotan jujubes are also on sale on Taobao. Even if they stay at home, they want to taste the taste of Xinjiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Today, &quot;know&quot; will talk to you about the &quot;bigness&quot; of Xinjiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73461&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70268&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/3fbf9d25ee.png&quot; img-title=&quot;custom – 1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width =&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/3fbf9d25ee.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258185&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73462&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70269&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/14/5dc309c9d1.png&quot; img-title=&quot;custom – 2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/5dc309c9d1.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258186&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73463&quot; group-id= &quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70270&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/22777928eb.png&quot; img-title=&quot;custom – 3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/22777928eb.png&quot; data- key=&quot;258187&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73464&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70271&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/b673748357.png&quot; img-title=&quot;custom – 4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data -src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/b673748357.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258188&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img -id=&quot;73465&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70272&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/3de07e6f6c.png&quot; img -title=&quot;custom – 5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/14/3de07e6f6c.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258189&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73466&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70273&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/f437541a92.png&quot; img-title=&quot;custom –6.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width =&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/f437541a92.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258190&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
