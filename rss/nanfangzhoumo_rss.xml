People&#39;s Assessor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not long ago, the Supreme People&#39;s Court issued the &quot;Several Provisions on People&#39;s Assessors with Specialized Knowledge to Participate in the Trial of Environmental Resources Cases&quot; on July 27, 2023 (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Regulations&quot;). This is not only a special demand for environmental resource cases (hereinafter referred to as &quot;environmental resource cases&quot;) that have surged in number in recent years and are extremely professional, but also a new expansion of the people&#39;s assessor system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the regulations were promulgated, Baicheng City in Jilin Province, Yangjiang City in Guangdong Province, Weichang County in Hebei Province, Lijin County in Shandong Province, Hunnan District in Shenyang City in Liaoning Province, Heilongjiang Forestry District and other places successively held court hearings on the province’s first cases involving persons with disabilities. People&#39;s assessors with specialized knowledge participate in environmental investment cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The jury system has only played a role in China&#39;s judicial field for a short time. In August 2004, the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress reviewed and passed the &quot;Decision on Improving the People&#39;s Assessor System&quot;, which clarified the people&#39;s assessor system for the first time, and China had &quot;unrobed judges.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the phenomenon of people&#39;s jurors &quot;accompanying the case but not trying the case, trying the case without deliberation&quot; and &quot;having no purpose&quot; is common, and has been criticized by the society and the legal circles. In April 2018, the Jury Law was officially promulgated, establishing principles such as random selection of jurors, term limits, and the &quot;grand collegial panel system&quot;, which has changed the shortcomings of the past to a certain extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Prior to this, China’s judicial system has set up an expert assistant system. The Criminal Procedure Law, Civil Procedure Law and other specialized laws revised after 2012 also increasingly advocate “expert assistants with specialized knowledge”. People appear in court.&quot; However, whether they are &quot;experts&quot; or &quot;people with specialized knowledge&quot;, they are all intended to solve professional and technical problems in the trial, and they all fall into the category of witnesses and evidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, in some cases in special fields, more and more &quot;expert&quot; people&#39;s jurors have appeared in collegial panels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Yongsheng, a professor of law at Peking University, said that the collegial panel consults professionals during the trial of cases, which has always existed in judicial practice. This institutionalization will help improve the professional trial level of environmental and capital-related cases. &quot;It is foreseeable that people with specialized knowledge will serve as jurors in other highly professional fields in the future.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The &quot;thrush&quot; whose identity is questionable&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;What kind of birds are the &quot;thrush&quot; and &quot;spotted water sparrow&quot;? Is it a thrush? Is it the same bird? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;In a case of illegal hunting of ferret badgers and &quot;thrushes&quot; heard by the Hanyuan County Court in Sichuan, the presiding judge He Gang encountered a problem. When the trial opened in May 2023, the court invited Li Zhihua, a staff member of the County Forestry Bureau, and Cao Lixiang, a staff member of the Qianyu Town Animal Health Supervision Office, to participate in the trial. Their identities were &quot;professional people&#39;s jurors.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the first environmental investment case in Sichuan to be heard by &quot;professional people&#39;s assessors&quot;, and it occurred before the regulations of the Supreme People&#39;s Court were promulgated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Hanyuan County Procuratorate accused Li Moumou of Malie Village of illegally manufacturing and possessing guns since 2018, and using slingshots and nail guns to hunt and kill multiple &quot;Thrushes&quot; and &quot;thrushes&quot; since 2020. A &quot;flower nose pattern&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because the case is not serious, this case adopts a simplified procedure, and the collegial panel adopts a &quot;1 (judge) + 2 (people&#39;s assessor)&quot; structure. The presiding judge, He Gang, is in his thirties and has served as a judge for 8 years. Although he has rich trial experience, he has insufficient biological knowledge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fur involved in the case was identified by Sichuan Agricultural University and was indeed a ferret and badger, a wild animal protected by the country’s “Three Certainties”. However, the thrush is a national second-level protected animal. What kind of bird the criminal mentioned as the &quot;thrush&quot; and how many there are are related to conviction and sentencing. Cao Lixiang and Li Zhihua, a staff member of the Hanyuan County Forestry Bureau, are here to help solve this problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cao Lixiang is a veterinarian with 30 years of experience. Since 2015, he has been recommended by the town government and selected as a people&#39;s assessor of the Hanyuan County Court. So far, he has participated in 20 or 30 court trials, but most of them were grassroots civil disputes. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This case in May 2023 was the first time that Cao Lixiang and Li Zhihua used their professional backgrounds to serve as jurors as &quot;people&#39;s jurors with specialized knowledge.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cao Lixiang and Li Zhihua read the case files provided by the court in advance. During the trial, Cao Lixiang asked a number of questions: What gun did you use to shoot? Where did you get the call? How many shots were fired? Was it one hit, or several hits? Where did the ferret badger hit? After questioning, it was compared with the captured ferret and badger pelts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years of practice, Cao Lixiang has learned to check witness and physical evidence, &quot;to see if it is consistent with his confession. To prevent scapegoating.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cao Lixiang further asked about the characteristics of the &quot;Thrush&quot; that Li Moumou hunted: What was the fur like? What color is it? Where does feather color change? What are the characteristics of the head, tail, and trunk? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the issue of &quot;Thrush&quot;, Li Moumou&#39;s expression included different dialect names such as &quot;Thrush&quot; and &quot;Thrush&quot;. Cao Lixiang and Li Zhihua said that in rural areas of Hanyuan County, the &quot;thrush (sound mi) bird&quot; does not necessarily correspond to a real thrush, but may also be a water sparrow or other birds. There are many types of thrushes in biology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cao Lixiang hopes to determine whether the bird Li killed is a thrush, a second-level national protected animal, through biological characteristics, living habits, flight height and movements. However, since the characteristics confessed by Li Moumou are inconsistent with the biological characteristics of the thrush, and there was no physical evidence at the time of the crime, reasonable doubt cannot be ruled out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, due to insufficient evidence, the court did not recognize the fact that Li Moumou &quot;hunted&quot; the thrush. Li Moumou was convicted of illegal hunting for hunting ferret badgers and was sentenced to four months in prison. In addition to the two charges of illegally manufacturing guns and illegally possessing guns, he was punished for several crimes and was sentenced to three years and six months in prison. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/ys29RW2wJIALlNMgvfDZyasJxXkL6kOvmOn7Augq.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;672&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/ys29RW2wJIALlNMgvfDZyasJxXkL6kOvmOn7Augq.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251256&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;After the people&#39;s jurors with professional knowledge expressed their opinions, the Hanyuan County Court in Sichuan did not recognize the fact that a defendant &quot;hunted&quot; the thrush. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(People&#39;s Vision/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The &quot;thing&quot; that cannot speak&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; He Gang said that environmental investment cases are different from ordinary cases. &quot;Most of the time, things that affect the environment are a kind of &#39;object&#39;. Objects cannot speak, and they involve professional problems. For example, if a plant in a place dies, it may be There are many reasons for the accumulation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the judge looks up the information by himself, it will be limited to the knowledge structure, which will either consume time, or be inaccurate and unauthoritative. At this time, it is crucial for someone with specialized knowledge to provide professional advice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another characteristic of environmental investment cases is that no one pays attention to them in the early stage. By the time they are discovered, the cycle of contamination or damage has been very long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Youhai, executive director of the China Green Development Research Institute of Tianjin University, was the director of the Bill Office of the Environment and Resources Protection Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress. He published a paper in 2022 &quot;The Expert Juror System in the Context of Environmental Justice Specialization&quot; Study&quot; mentioned that environmental resource cases have complex causal relationships, resulting in long trial times. Due to the lack of professional knowledge, parties may easily doubt the fairness of court trials, affecting judicial credibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, Sun Youhai took the 2007 exhaust gas case from a mining and chemical company in Fujian. From 2010 to 2012, it went through prosecution, first-instance judgment, appeal, remand for retrial, second-instance judgment, application for retrial, and remand for retrial. The tortuous process of the retrial and the retrial judgment caused dissatisfaction among the parties involved. “One of the core reasons for the long and repetitive trial process is that the appraisal opinions of different appraisal agencies are inconsistent. However, environmental judges do not have professional environmental knowledge, so they cannot make accurate judgments on the appraisal opinions in a timely manner, which leads to the judicial organs’ inconsistencies in case trials and judgments. It is difficult to characterize the case.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the actual trial of environmental and capital-related cases, it is necessary to improve the professionalism of jurors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as April 2019, the Supreme People’s Court issued a judicial interpretation of the Jury Law, which stipulated that “if the type of case requires people’s jurors with corresponding professional knowledge to participate in collegial panel trials, they may be The circumstances of the case shall be determined by random selection from the list of people&#39;s jurors who meet professional needs.&quot; Since then, &quot;expert jurors&quot; have been selected for cases in the fields of intellectual property, minors, finance, medical disputes, and network technology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In comparison, environmental investment cases involve chemical, biological, forestry, animal husbandry, minerals, land, water resources and other subcategories. They are more professional and difficult for laymen to judge. The needs are also more urgent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;The regulations issued by the Supreme Law on environmental capital cases clarify that &quot;people&#39;s jurors with specialized knowledge&quot; refer to those who have specialized knowledge in the field of environmental resources, or who have experience in environmental resources administrative departments, scientific research institutes, higher education institutions, etc. Jurors who have worked in institutions, enterprises, social organizations and other units for more than three years. This regulation will be implemented from August 1, 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, before the regulations were promulgated, courts at all levels across the country had already conducted many relevant explorations and practices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The People&#39;s Court of Qingzhen City, Guizhou Province established China&#39;s first ecological protection court in 2007. In December 2010, the court invited two people to hear a case of illegal discharge of sewage from a paper mill. The &quot;people&#39;s assessors&quot; include Shuai Jiang, a senior environmental engineer and director of Guiyang&#39;s Two Lakes and One Reservoir Management Bureau, and Liu Xiaojing, a Ph.D. in environmental protection. An expert advisory committee was convened to conduct demonstrations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2014, the Wanzhou District Court of Chongqing approved the appointment of four environmental experts including Yao Weizhi, deputy director of the Fisheries Resources Research Institute of Southwest University, and Ren Ping, director of the Wanzhou District Forestry Science Institute, to serve as jurors He has participated in the trial of a series of cases including the Fengjie County electromagnetic radiation case, the yew pollution case, and the Kaixian cattle farm land pollution case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some places are also actively building expert databases for environmental jurors. For example, the Higher People&#39;s Court of Guizhou Province issued the &quot;Regulations on the Participation of Environmental Expert Jurors in Case Trials&quot; in early 2014 and established an expert database for ecological and environmental jurors. From January 2016 to December 2017, Chongqing courts at all levels hired a total of 18 experts as expert jurors to participate in the collegial panel hearing of 124 cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By 2022, it will gradually become a trend to invite experts with environmental protection expertise to serve as jurors. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Randomness and fairness&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2018, the first special legal jury law on the people&#39;s assessor system was promulgated, which was widely praised by the legal community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Yongsheng, a law professor at Peking University, believes that a very important point of the jury law is to strengthen the randomness of jurors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, people&#39;s jurors in courts at all levels were mainly recommended by their units and grassroots organizations, or jurors recommended themselves. After the promulgation of the Juror Law, although the recommendation model has been retained, the main method of selection is that the judicial administrative agency, together with the courts and the public security agency, randomly selects from the list of local residents, conducts a qualification review, and then submits it to the Standing Committee of the People&#39;s Congress at the same level for approval and approval. appointment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Yongsheng also believes that before the law was enacted, the jury seats in many places were fixed and full-time for a long time. They were familiar with the judges and had difficulty in functioning. The random generation of jurors helps prevent judicial corruption. &quot;The laws of psychology show that the possibility of corruption is higher when a person is dealing with acquaintances. On the contrary, in front of a stranger, if the other party violates the law, the other party will You may still have concerns about reporting and seeking improper benefits.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1980s and 1990s, China&#39;s legal system had a &quot;negative attitude&quot; towards the jury system. Academic circles call it the &quot;low ebb&quot; of the jury system. At that time, He Jiahong, who later became a law professor at Renmin University of China, was still studying in the United States and had begun to understand the American jury system. The Simpson case that occurred in the 1990s gave great inspiration to the Chinese legal community. &quot;It turns out that cases in the United States can still be tried in this way and let some ordinary people decide.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Jury Law, the court selects 5 times the number of proposed jurors as candidates, and the number of jurors actually selected is not less than 3 times the number of judges of the court. In some pilot courts, the number of jurors is even 10 times that of judges. This is precisely to enhance the broadness and representativeness of the people&#39;s assessors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, the Juror Law stipulated that jurors must be at least 28 years old, which is higher than the 23 years old requirement in 2004. Chen Yongsheng once proposed that based on the principle of &quot;same trial&quot;, the age limit should be expanded. &quot;This is to expand and enhance the representativeness of judges. Because of the existing regulations, defendants under the age of 28 do not have the identity composition corresponding to Homogeneous jurors”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind this proposal, the inherent spirit of the jury system is reflected - jurors should not only be selected from legal professionals, such as university professors and judicial assistants, but also should introduce folk wisdom. In other words, let &quot;lay people&quot; participate in the trial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Why should a jury system be established? Because the way people who have studied law has formatted their minds to think about problems, they are more rational than ordinary people. And private juries Based on perceptual life experience, a judge can fully understand the cause-and-effect connections and feelings and reactions of the defendant when he behaves better than a judge.&quot; Chen Yongsheng said that this will help the case judgment to be more in line with the legal provisions, and also help the court to maximize its effectiveness within the legal framework. Taking into account the humanity and personal feelings of the parties involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, the judicial interpretation of the Supreme People&#39;s Court has changed the standard for determining &quot;justifiable defense&quot; due to the public opinion caused by many major cases, and it has become closer to human ethics. &quot;If the jury system is used properly, it can achieve the organic unity of national law and human relations, national law and natural justice.&quot; Chen Yongsheng said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Anglo-American jury system is composed of one team for each case, and a new team is formed for each case. Jurors in the civil law system also have a term limit of no more than two terms. &quot;Whether it is the common law system or the civil law system, you cannot always serve as a juror to prevent jurors from changing from laymen to experts. Otherwise, the advantages that jurors may have as laymen cannot be used.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics from the Supreme People&#39;s Court, as of 2021, there are more than 316,000 people&#39;s jurors across the country, an increase of about 50% from 2018. He Jiahong believes that in recent years, the number of cases nationwide has increased rapidly. Since 2019, the total number of cases accepted by people&#39;s courts at all levels across the country has been more than 30 million every year. &quot;The number of cases involving specialized knowledge in various fields is also increasing. Therefore, the courts are facing the problem of insufficient manpower and brainpower.&quot; He Jiahong believes that the introduction of regulations this time to invite people with specialized knowledge to serve as people&#39;s assessors can effectively solve the problem of court manpower and brainpower. Lack of brain power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/MAnwC42xdiZsLdSFdeEYFFPyxO9AjO6hm41DCkSr.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;865&quot; height= &quot;577&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/MAnwC42xdiZsLdSFdeEYFFPyxO9AjO6hm41DCkSr.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251254&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;People&#39;s assessors Cao Lixiang (middle) and Li Zhihua (right) are looking at relevant evidence. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Hanyuan County People&#39;s Court/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;From &quot;expert&quot; to &quot;professional knowledge&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt; /h4>; &lt;p>;“This new regulation only institutionalizes a method that was widely used in previous practice in a certain type of case.” Chen Yongsheng said that British Justice Dan Dan was widely recognized by the Chinese legal circle. Lord Ning also mentioned in his book &quot;Due Process of the Law&quot; that an important function of the jury is to hire professional jurors to resolve professional issues. &quot;It is foreseeable that the use of people with specialized knowledge to serve as jurors will also be implemented in other more professional fields in the future, or corresponding regulations will be introduced.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Yongsheng once served as a consulting expert and was invited by the Public Security Bureau to discuss some environmental protection cases, but he admitted that he could only express opinions on the legal issues involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, Chen Yongsheng encountered a criminal case involving pollution caused by the accumulation of construction waste. The procuratorate hoped to determine whether the suspect committed a crime by understanding the degree of harm and whether to prosecute. &quot;I don&#39;t know whether a kind of garbage is harmful to the environment. I think construction waste is nothing more than steel bars and cement and should be harmless. But professionals say that the accumulation of construction waste will damage the soil and cultivated land, and it will also be damaged after being wet by rain. Some toxic substances will be released. This requires specialized researchers to understand.&quot; In the end, the opinions of environmental experts played an important reference role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, before the regulations were promulgated, Tianjin University Law School was entrusted to hold an expert seminar on &quot;Several Provisions of the Supreme People&#39;s Court on the Participation of Expert People&#39;s Assessors in the Trial of Environmental Resources Cases&quot; (Draft for Comments). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the final regulations, &quot;expert people&#39;s assessors&quot; were changed to &quot;people&#39;s assessors with specialized knowledge.&quot; The change in title was based on practical considerations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Chen Yongsheng&#39;s view, the so-called experts should at least have a master&#39;s degree or even a doctorate, work in a university or scientific research institution, and have an intermediate or even deputy senior professional title. &quot;The ideal situation is of course for experts to serve as jurors. But there are more than 3,000 courts across the country, and more than 90% of them are grassroots courts. If the status is limited to experts, the threshold is too high, and grassroots courts obviously cannot do it.&quot; In fact, the grassroots courts cannot do it. , the professional issues in most cases only need to be identified by people with relevant professional background and experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, &quot;person with specialized knowledge&quot; is also a relatively common term in law. There are many provisions in the current Criminal Procedure Law and Civil Procedure Law to &quot;hire persons with specialized knowledge&quot; to appear in court or Make an appraisal. Chen Yongsheng explained, &quot;This &#39;person with specialized knowledge&#39; is called an expert assistant in the legal world, and is sometimes called an expert witness.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But obviously, these all belong to the category of witnesses, and are not the same as those introduced in the collegial panel. Knowledgeable jurors are two different judicial paths and directions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Xiangbin, a lawyer at Hubei Huanyuan Law Firm, has conducted dozens of public interest litigations on environmental investment cases. &quot;I have not found a case where professional issues have affected the fair trial of the court.&quot; &quot;The existing litigation system is sufficient, and there is no need to find an additional professional person.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Yongsheng does not agree with this. Chen Yongsheng believes that the expert witness and judicial appraisal system serve both parties in the dispute. The appraisal reports issued by each party are generally beneficial to them, and the expert witnesses invited are often also beneficial to them. In the same case, the appraisal results of the plaintiff and the defendant are sometimes opposite, and even the procuratorate’s appraisal results are inconsistent several times. “At this time, jurors with professional knowledge stand in a neutral position to judge the prosecution and defense.” It is necessary to distinguish the true from the false and eliminate the false while retaining the true.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Youhai also pointed out in the paper that expert assistants are only responsible for the parties, and their neutrality and independence are lacking. This is different for jurors with professional knowledge. On the one hand, they can scientifically determine the evidence and facts of the case; On the other hand, it can also effectively supervise the trial work of the court on behalf of the people. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Equality of power with judges must be ensured&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The regulations announced by the Supreme People’s Court this time will apply to basic people’s courts and intermediate people’s courts. When hearing environmental resources cases, clear requirements are put forward for the number of &quot;people&#39;s jurors with specialized knowledge&quot;, and requirements are also put forward for the number of collegial panels depending on the circumstances of the case, which is basically consistent with the principles of the Jury Law. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both He Jiahong and Chen Yongsheng believe that although the legislation is relatively complete, the biggest problem in judicial practice is that the jury system has not been fully implemented. In recent years, some cases with significant social impact have not all adopted the jury system. Chen Yongsheng believes that &quot;Although the case handling agency also made excuses, for example, it was worried that the jurors would not be able to manipulate and make decisions, their excuses were not convincing. It violated the legislative purpose of the Juror Law.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He Jiahong also expressed regret, &quot;Including judicial reforms in countries with civil law systems such as France, major and serious criminal cases have adopted the jury system. However, in our country for many years, some major cases have not required juries, but daily ordinary cases have used juries. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He and some legal experts were invited by the court to observe some court trials. One expert said, &quot;This case is not very important, and the defendant also pleaded guilty and there is no dispute. Why do we need jurors? ?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Jiahong believes that these cases with great social impact were originally excellent opportunities to promote the concept of the jury system to the society, but they were wasted. &quot;With extremely high attention, higher requirements have also been put forward on how court leaders and judges manage the collegiate bench.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason is that Chen Yongsheng said that many cases need to be reported to special committees, adjudicatory committees, judges, deans, and even to higher-level courts, political and legal committees and other higher-level units before decisions can be made. result. “The decision-making power in many cases does not lie with the collegial panel.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Yongsheng said, &quot;The collegial panel has no decision-making power, let alone jurors. Even if the jurors express their opinions, they cannot affect the outcome of the case, which leads to the jurors being unwilling to actively exercise their right to serve as a jury.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;Specifically when it comes to the trial of environmental resources cases, Sun Youhai pointed out that a guarantee system should be provided for people&#39;s jurors with specialized knowledge, including the right to participate in the trial, the right to know the case and the right to vote on the case, to ensure that the jurors&#39; rights and The equal power of judges allows them to &quot;devote themselves whole-heartedly to the jury work of the case and have no worries when performing their jury duties.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[在野党党首绝食抗议，日本核污水排海再引韩国朝野纷争]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257212]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-20 17:39:44&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/20/uMBu5GmaGxoYRYoG1X1WJetEUJcrCreencsaMH7u.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/uMBu5GmaGxoYRYoG1X1WJetEUJcrCreencsaMH7u. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251307&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Congressman Lee, you are no longer alone.&quot; On the afternoon of September 19, 2023, former South Korean President Moon Jae-in appeared at a hospital in Seoul to visit Lee Jae-myung, leader of the opposition Democratic Party of Korea . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moon Jae-in held Lee Jae-myung&#39;s hands tightly and persuaded him to &quot;stop the hunger strike&quot; and engage in the &quot;long-term battle&quot; (of the Common Democratic Party) with a new attitude. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Early the morning before, an ambulance took Li Zaiming to the hospital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Lee was in extremely poor health tomorrow morning and was in a daze and had to make an emergency call.&quot; Park Sang-joon, spokesman for the Democratic Party of Korea, told South Korea&#39;s YTN radio station. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;September 18, 2023 was the 19th day of Li Zaiming&#39;s &quot;hunger strike&quot; to demonstrate against the Yin Xiyue government. On that day, the South Korean court once again filed an application for detention of Li Zaiming on the charge of &quot;dereliction of duty.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lee Jae-myung accused the Yoon Seok-yue regime of undermining order and democracy in South Korea, and went on a hunger strike on August 31. As of now, Li Zaiming is out of danger, but his body is still weak. He stated that he would only maintain infusion treatment and continue his hunger strike. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Lee Jae-myung&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;’s “indefinite hunger strike”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“As one of the citizens, I start today to challenge the incompetent and violent regime. &#39;National&#39; resistance.&quot; On August 31, 2023, Lee Jae-myung announced an &quot;indefinite hunger strike&quot; at the press conference for the first anniversary of the Democratic Party of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zaiming made three demands to the ruling party: Yin Xiyue apologized to the people for destroying people&#39;s livelihood; the ruling party should oppose Japan&#39;s discharge of nuclear-contaminated water into the sea; and reorganize the cabinet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lee Jae-myung is Moon Jae-in’s “successor” within the party. Before entering politics, Li Zaiming was a human rights lawyer and participated in human rights and citizen movements many times. From 2010 to 2021, Lee Jae-myung served successively as the mayor of Seongnam and the governor of Gyeonggi Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2021, Lee Jae-myung resigned as governor of Gyeonggi Province and participated in the South Korean presidential election. He narrowly lost to South Korean President Yoon Seok-yue and later became the leader of the Democratic Party of Korea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early days of the hunger strike, Li Zaiming set up a tent in front of the Capitol and conducted a sit-in protest. As Lee Jae-myung&#39;s health declined, he began to move into the party leader&#39;s office. Many senior figures from the Democratic Party of Korea and South Korean politicians came to persuade him to stop his hunger strike. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Korean media reports, the ruling National Power Party &quot;took no measures&quot; in response to Lee Jae-myung&#39;s hunger strike. &lt;p>; /p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Central Daily News&quot; editorial criticized the ruling party&#39;s inappropriate stance on &quot;Lee Jae-myung&#39;s hunger strike.&quot; The National Power Party once ridiculed that &quot;a seafood tasting event will be held near Lee Jae-myung&#39;s hunger strike tent.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sit-ins, marches and hunger strikes are common practice in South Korea’s political arena, and both the ruling and opposition parties will express condolences to hunger strikers. In the 1980s, when former South Korean President Kim Young-sam went on a hunger strike, the secretary of the then ruling party went to express condolences and conveyed then President Chun Doo-hwan’s intention to urge an end to the hunger strike; in 1990, when former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung went on a hunger strike to demand the full implementation of local autonomy , Jin Yongsan also went to express condolences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Facing pressure from public opinion, Kim Ki-hyun posted on social media on September 16, &quot;solemnly requesting Lee Jae-myung to stop his hunger strike&quot; and proposing to hold a meeting between the leaders of the ruling and opposition parties to discuss people&#39;s livelihood affairs after he &quot;recovers his health.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“To avoid prosecution charges”? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;South Korean prosecutors once believed that Lee Jae-myung&#39;s hunger strike was suspected of avoiding the prosecutor&#39;s investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This is the first time I have gone on a hunger strike after being notified of being summoned by the prosecutor.” Korean Minister of Justice Han Dong-hoon complained that the continued operation of the judicial system cannot be suspended just because a suspect under investigation went on a hunger strike. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 4, South Korean prosecutors investigated Lee Jae-ming in connection with the &quot;Sangling Group Bribery Case.&quot; It is believed that when he was the governor of Gyeonggi Province from 2019 to 2020, he was suspected of soliciting a bribe of approximately 10.6 billion won from Kim Sung-tae, chairman of Sangryong Group, on the pretext of paying for a visit to North Korea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Li Zaiming is related to two cases. From 2014 to 2015, while serving as the mayor of Seongnam City, Lee Jae-myung was suspected of taking care of real estate developers based on his position, causing the Seongnam Urban Development Corporation to lose 20 billion won. In February 2019, Lee Jae-myung was suspected of violating the Public Office Election Act and instigating others to provide false testimony that was favorable to him during his trial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of September 18, when Li Zaiming was seeking medical treatment, South Korean prosecutors merged the two suspicions of the &quot;Sangling Group Bribery Case&quot; and the &quot;Real Estate Case&quot; and applied for an arrest warrant against Li Zaiming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 19, Yin Xiyue, who was attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York, approved the arrest consent request sent by the prosecutor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a current member of Congress, Lee Jae-myung enjoys the privilege of not being arrested without the consent of Congress. To arrest a member of Congress, more than half of the members must be present and more than half of the members must agree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to South Korea&#39;s &quot;Parliament Law&quot;, after receiving the consent for arrest, the Speaker of the National Assembly needs to convene a plenary meeting report on the matter and vote &quot;within 24 hours and 72 hours&quot; after the report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;South Korean prosecutors are using clues to bite Li Zaiming, but the possibility of him being arrested this time is not high.&quot; Li Jiacheng, associate professor at the School of International Economics and Politics at Liaoning University, analyzed to Southern Weekend reporters, South Korea in February 2023 The prosecutor&#39;s request to arrest Lee Jae-myung for the real estate case was rejected by Congress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, South Korea has 297 current members of Congress, including 167 members from the Common Democratic Party, accounting for more than half of the opposition parties. This time, Li Zaiming&#39;s hunger strike received concern and condolences from important people within the party. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Central Daily News&quot; report, on September 20, the South Korean Congress will hold a plenary meeting to discuss the &quot;Lee Jae-myung Arrest Consent Case&quot; and vote on September 21. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 21, the South Korean Congress will also vote on the &quot;Recommendation for the Removal of Prime Minister Han Deok-soo.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to Lee Jae-myung’s hunger strike, the Democratic Party of Korea submitted a proposal to dismiss Prime Minister Han Deok-soo on September 16, demanding the collective resignation of the ruling party’s cabinet. The move was seen as an attempt by the opposition parties to put pressure on the Yoon Seok-yue government. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The controversy behind the discharge of nuclear-contaminated water into the sea&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the recent &quot;issue of Japan&#39;s discharge of nuclear-contaminated water into the sea&quot;, the Korean government and the opposition are quite divided. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of August 23, before the hunger strike, Lee Jae-myung led more than a thousand people related to the Democratic Party of Korea to hold a candlelight rally. He accused &quot;the East China Sea is turning into the Sea of ​​Japan&quot; and urged the Yoon Seok-yue government to oppose the discharge of Japan&#39;s nuclear-contaminated water into the sea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The National Power Party represented by Yin Xiyue supports &quot;discharging nuclear contaminated water into the sea&quot; and sends a signal to the international community that &quot;you will not die if you eat aquatic products.&quot; On August 29, the ruling party held a two-day and one-night &quot;eating broadcast&quot; to promote aquatic products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Representative Lee (Jae-myeong) comes to a place like this and eats some (aquatic products)!&quot; Park Dae-chu, chairman of the policy committee of the National Power Party, joked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Ordinary people in South Korea strongly oppose Japan&#39;s discharge of nuclear-contaminated water into the sea, and the progressive Democratic Party supports the ordinary people. The National Power Party, which is dominated by conservative forces, is pro-American and pro-Japanese in foreign policy. Yoon Seok-yue The government strongly supports Japan&#39;s discharge of nuclear-contaminated water. The opposition between South Korea&#39;s ruling party and public opinion has become a political opportunity for Lee Jae-myung,&quot; Li Jiacheng told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Jiacheng believes that Li Zaiming’s hunger strike is more like preparation for canvassing votes for the 2024 South Korean parliamentary election. On the one hand, he united the &quot;unknown&quot; forces within the Democratic Party of Korea, and on the other hand, he fought for the &quot;people&quot; and won the sympathy votes of voters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 10, 2024, the South Korean Congress will hold an election. Since Lee Jae-myung&#39;s Democratic Party holds a majority of seats in the National Assembly, the ruling National Power Party hopes to regain control of the National Assembly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;自2022年尹锡悦以0.73%的微弱优势险胜民主党候选人李在明后，他从未承认过李在明是其“对话伙伴”。二人自选举后也未举行过正式会谈。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“尹锡悦不屑于与嫌疑人（李在明）进行会谈。”《韩民族日报》援引一位执政党核心人士的话。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在李在明就医后的9月19日，据韩国Media Tomato民调显示，只有不到30%的民众对&lt;span>;尹锡悦执政给出了正面评价&lt;/span>;。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;近半数民众认为李在明绝食是对“尹锡悦管理不善的抗议”，近42%的人反对“逮捕李在明”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（南方周末实习生林曦对本文亦有贡献）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 17:55:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[最高法发布危害药品安全犯罪典型案例]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257158]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-20 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;最高人民法院18日发布5起危害药品安全犯罪典型案例，涉及进口药品、疫苗、医疗美容药品、特病药品、口腔科非处方药品等不同药品类型，包括网络犯罪、消毒产品冒充药品、医保骗保等典型犯罪手段。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这5起典型案例是：黄某霖等生产、销售假药案；闫某销售伪劣产品案；张某松等生产、销售假药案；杨某鱼、蔡某掩饰、隐瞒犯罪所得案；未某等生产、销售假药案。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;药品安全事关人民群众身体健康和生命安全，事关国计民生，事关社会大局稳定。此次公布的案件均与人民群众日常用药安全息息相关，具有一定的代表性。其中多名被告人被判处十年以上有期徒刑，并被处以高额罚金，体现了人民法院坚持人民至上、从严惩治危害药品安全犯罪的鲜明态度和坚定决心。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据介绍，各级人民法院严格落实“四个最严”要求，充分发挥审判职能作用，依法严惩危害药品安全犯罪，切实保障人民群众用药安全。 2013年至2022年，全国法院共审结生产、销售、提供假药罪，生产、销售、提供劣药罪以及妨害药品管理罪一审刑事案件2.8万余件，判决3.8万余人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;下一步，最高法将监督指导地方各级人民法院进一步提高思想认识，压实主体责任，依法审判，能动司法，把维护药品安全、保障人民健康落到实处。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[人文主义地理学之父段义孚终其一生都在思考啥问题？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257005]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-20 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/19/8Gdihs9dKjOZzzDXXM4o2BOpZHSMlsdy5BXwBaHW.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;846&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/8Gdihs9dKjOZzzDXXM4o2BOpZHSMlsdy5B XwBaHW. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251242&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tuan Yifu and his autobiography &quot;Who Am I?&quot; &quot;(Shanghai Bookstore Publishing House, 2023). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Standing on the pedestrian bridge, looking at the brightly lit city under the night sky, I can&#39;t help but think of Mondrian&#39;s paintings. It is an art composed of colorful grids and lines, and is a visual presentation of the balanced beauty of the universe. I have to think about: What is the connection between cities, landscapes, architecture, art, etc., and people? This is also a question that Yifu Tuan, the father of humanistic geography, has been thinking about throughout his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When talking about Duan Yifu, people may mention his birthplace of Tianjin, his childhood place of residence in Chongqing, his relationship with Duan Qirui, talk about the countries and countless cities he has traveled to, and admire his work in Despite his brilliant academic achievements, he may still lament his long and lonely life. Such a life is complicated - both brilliant and dull, surrounded by others and often alone. He settled in an apartment in a metropolis, but rooted his soul in the desert and the universe...&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;Because of his rich, wise and simple inner world, Yifu Tuan is often called the &quot;little prince&quot; in the field of geography. His most well-known achievement is that in the 1960s and 1970s, when the positivism advocating instrumental rationality swept Western geography, he restored the humanistic spirit of geography in a simple, determined and wise way, and pioneered the study of geography. Humanistic geography, which had a far-reaching influence on later generations, became famous in the world academic circles. Although there have been many differences and tensions between the development of geography and Tuan Yifu&#39;s thoughts since the 1980s, and his own research and writing style is difficult to be inherited by later generations, his knowledge creation and wisdom enlightenment have always been beyond the reach of geography. An overlooked bright color. In other words, if Yifu Tuan had not been born in this world, the light of geography’s wisdom would be much dimmer than it is now. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many scholars have written articles about Yifu Tuan’s life and contribution to geography. In my eyes, one of Yifu Tuan&#39;s most outstanding contributions to geography is that he restored the aesthetics and emotion of geography, thus greatly expanding the scope of geography research and writing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before Yifu Tuan, many geographers had emphasized that the expression of aesthetics and emotion is an important channel for understanding the natural environment. This actually goes back to a common question asked by scientists during the Enlightenment: How do people understand nature? Alexander von Humboldt, who had a profound influence on Yifu Tuan, was one of the important figures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/OFo8OX1dEBnqWuulC3E4n7CNjYjYnvhPftAYk0IV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;928&quot; height= &quot;580&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/OFo8OX1dEBnqWuulC3E4n7CNjYjYnvhPftAYk0IV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251241&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Alexander von Humboldt. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Humboldt devoted his life to inspiring &quot;love of nature&quot; and advocated that &quot;nature must also be experienced through human feelings&quot;, Because Humboldt himself was greatly influenced by Kant&#39;s transcendental rationalism. Kant emphasized that human reason legislates nature, which naturally shifts the relationship between human beings and the environment to the human side. As a result, Humboldt&#39;s thought first brewed the &quot;people-centered&quot; humanistic geography perspective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, while Humboldt was in Jena, he lived with the poet Goethe day and night, and influenced each other, which made his study of nature constantly highlight human subjectivity. He shifted from his initial obsession with pure empirical analysis to Develop an understanding of nature, linking precise scientific evidence with emotional responses to landscapes. Furthermore, he also re-examined people&#39;s &quot;imagination&quot; and believed that imagination is as important as rational thinking and is also a necessary tool for understanding nature. These seeds of Humboldt&#39;s thoughts were sown in Tuan Yifu&#39;s thoughts. In many of Yifu Tuan&#39;s works, we can clearly feel the intertwining of reason and imagination, which constitutes an important channel for interpreting the meaning of the environment. For example, Yifu Tuan&#39;s work &quot;Place, Art and Self&quot; explores the bridge of meaning between environment, emotion and self. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If Humboldt inspired Yifu Tuan’s human-centered perspective, then the “semiotics” that attempts to connect people and things helped Yifu Tuan open up the emotional relationship between people and the environment. American philosopher Susan Lange is an important figure in semiotic aesthetics. Her &quot;Emotion and Form&quot; is a book often cited by Yi-fu Tuan. Her influence on Yifu Tuan is reflected in exploring the &quot;form&quot; relationship between human feelings and the environment. This relationship is known in geography as &quot;sense of place.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Susan Lange insists that the human senses are also capable of abstraction. As she puts it: &quot;Eye and ear must have their logic.&quot; Such logic is not a positivist inference of factual evidence. Logic, but the &quot;logic of representation&quot; when people experience environmental materials. For example, although waves have no direct relationship with life on the physical level, the image of never-ending waves is as continuous as life. This is what Susan Lange calls the similarity of representational logic, which is also the form of emotion, a symbol that connects people&#39;s feelings with the environment. Yifu Tuan uses metaphors in many works to describe such connections. For example, Yifu Tuan talked about how people would associate their bodies with the landscape, producing words like &quot;ridge&quot; and &quot;estuary&quot;. Although at the physical level, mountains have no backs and rivers have no mouths, there are similarities in apparent logic between them. Then, artificially creating these words expresses the formal isomorphic relationship between human feelings and natural objects. This kind of &quot;sense of place&quot; is exactly what Yifu Tuan is exploring. For example, the relationship between vision and color, body and architecture, imagination and mountains, etc. Furthermore, at the deepest level, the isomorphic relationship between &quot;identity&quot; and &quot;place&quot; can also be explored. Yifu Tuan summarizes all these relationships into one term - &quot;experience&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/YEJQETUdhzENESNAVxpx6BdxfD754p2EkWQeWzaZ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height= &quot;848&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/YEJQETUdhzENESNAVxpx6BdxfD754p2EkWQeWzaZ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251243&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Susan Lange&#39;s &quot;Emotion and Form&quot; is a book that Yifu Tuan often quotes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What are the attributes of &quot;experience&quot;? In the book &quot;Space and Place&quot;, he pointed out: Experience is like a spectrum, with one end leaning toward emotion and the other end toward thought, but the two blend with each other from beginning to end. Therefore, Yifu Tuan&#39;s definition of the connotation of experience has greatly expanded the scope of geographical epistemology: while recognizing the value of rational analysis (scientific), it also gives equal status to emotional description. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, Yifu Tuan’s geographical emotion is an emotion that can communicate with others, can form intersubjectivity, and has an objective logical form. In other words, this emotion starts from the individual and transcends the individual. It is a kind of intentionality with universal significance. It is precisely because of this that Yifu Tuan&#39;s geography can enter the public domain and generate extremely high academic value. Therefore, it is not as criticized by positivists that Tuan Yifu&#39;s geography is only individual and subjective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his academic career of more than sixty years, Yi-fu Tuan created a large number of geographical works rich in emotion and aesthetic form. For example, he successively explored the relationship between alienation and fragmentation between people and the environment (&quot;The Broken World and the Self&quot; in 1982), the coexistence of pampering and manipulation (&quot;Making Pets&quot; in 1984), and the relationship between localism and cosmopolitanism (1996 &quot;The Universe and the Hearth&quot; (1998)), and the relationship of escape (&quot;Escapism&quot; (1998)), etc. These works have greatly enriched the research content of geography. According to Tim Criswell, a former protégé of Yi-Fu Tuan and now a professor of geography at the University of Edinburgh, “When Yi-Fu Tuan was studying the desert landscapes of the American Southwest, few geographers cared about how the landscape reflected human life. Values, and no one will pay attention to people&#39;s emotions of pampering and controlling the environment, and no one will think that the most ordinary things in life, such as houses, gutters and scissors, have beauty.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time , in order to explore these relationships, Duan Yifu not only wandered through various fragments of literature, ethnography, psychology, and ancient urban history, but also used poetic language to skillfully weave the themes he wanted to express. , the scope of geography writing has been greatly expanded, providing rich nutrients for the development of humanistic geography in later generations. Therefore, Tim Criswell said: Yifu Tuan’s influence has transcended the glorious 1970s of humanistic geography. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Yifu Tuan’s geographical aesthetic appreciation is not entirely an objectified aesthetic appreciation. He even incorporated his own life experience into it. As Duan Yifu wrote in his autobiography &quot;Who Am I?&quot; &quot;&quot; said that geography helped him overcome the loss of life and find the meaning of life. It was geography that saved him. Therefore, Tuan Yifu&#39;s geography is often a kind of writing that &quot;uses itself as a method&quot;. In other words, he analyzed his life as a practical sample for the world to observe, allowing others to see his own joys, anger, sorrows, life and death, and then formed a kind of environmental aesthetics and emotional expression in which the author&#39;s &quot;subject appears&quot;, which is profound. The intensity and appeal far exceed the object-oriented aesthetic method of simply standing opposite the scenery and maintaining a certain distance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, 92-year-old Yifu Tuan published a booklet titled &quot;Geography from 1947 to 2022: A Travel Record&quot;. He said:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What exactly is my contribution to human geography? That is, I enriched the meaning of the word &quot;person&quot;. In the past, geographers in the field of natural science were people who had the courage to explore inaccessible places. When I was an undergraduate, the geography professors at Oxford and Cambridge were all such explorers. …They have little to no interest in people. When geographers talk about people, they just treat them as another natural force that changes the landscape of the earth. Since the 1930s, talents have been given other attributes. First, under the influence of Karl Saul, people were given cultural attributes; then in the 1960s, under the influence of David Lowenthal and Robert Gates, people were given psychological attributes; and finally in the 1970s, people were given psychological attributes. In the era, people are endowed with aesthetic attributes. But what baffles me is why such an obviously human attribute has been ignored for so long. The fact that it was ignored was due to the prevailing paradigm at the time. Therefore, I urge you once again, young traveler! Be sure to have the courage to steer your ship like a captain, albeit with only life&#39;s confusing clues and stars as your guides. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is Yifu Tuan’s contribution to geography. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 16:26:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[三年4任董事长，“药中茅台”为何震荡不断？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257180]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-20 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/20/rCNgV1xm9msQKl2HYkAS2vgrqM209hWEGqk8Z4kU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/rCNgV1xm9msQKl2HYkAS2vgrqM209 hWEGqk8Z4kU. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251259&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Many time-honored traditional Chinese medicine companies face the same anti-corruption problem. (Pien Tze Huang, composed of bezoars, musk, notoginseng, and snake gall, is used to clear away heat. Detoxify, cool blood and remove blood stasis, reduce swelling and relieve pain. This small pill is said to have been introduced from the Ming Dynasty. The company that manufactured it was founded in 1956 and has been on the market for 20 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Pien Tze Huang has reached a turning point again.” Li Bin, a long-term holder of Pien Tze Huang shares, private equity fund manager Li Bin, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 6, 2023, Lin Zhihui, the new chairman of Pien Tze Huang (600436.SH), with a total market value of more than 164 billion and known as the &quot;Moutai of Medicine&quot; by the market, attended the 6th &quot;Belt and Road Initiative&quot; Traditional Chinese Medicine Development Forum. Investors believe this is his first appearance since becoming the new chairman in early August. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is Pien Tze Huang’s fourth coaching change since 2021. The previous two chairman of the board were investigated by the Discipline Inspection Commission for suspected serious violations of disciplines and laws. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of August, the Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision of Zhangzhou City, Fujian Province released information that Liu Jianshun, who had served as chairman of Pien Tze Huang for seven years, was expelled from the party for violating laws and disciplines. He will retire in 2021. Pan Jie, who succeeded him, was also subject to disciplinary review and supervisory investigation by the Zhangzhou Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision in May for suspected serious violations of discipline and law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to incomplete statistics from Southern Weekend reporters, five executives of Pien Tze Huang and its subsidiaries have been investigated in 2023. From June 2022 to the present, Pien Tze Huang’s board secretary, chief engineer, chief auditor, etc. Many senior executives have resigned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of Lu Dingliang, a lawyer at Jingshi Law Firm, the products of traditional Chinese medicine companies such as Pien Tze Huang leave room for power rent-seeking due to their certain resource nature and scarcity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The number of Pien Tze Huang executives who have been investigated is relatively prominent, which is closely related to the company’s stock price, product selling price and scarcity.” He analyzed to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Chairman of &quot;Liu Shui&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Zhangzhou Pien Tze Huang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. was founded in 1999 by the restructuring of Zhangzhou Pharmaceutical Factory, which was established in 1956. , currently has 13 directly held subsidiaries and 9 joint-stock companies. Its controlling shareholder is a state-owned enterprise in Zhangzhou City. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of August, the Zhangzhou Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision released information that former chairman Liu Jianshun was expelled from the party for serious violations of discipline and law. It mentioned that he &quot;received gifts and large amounts of money in violation of regulations; relied on enterprises to support enterprises, and took advantage of his position to provide Others seek benefits and accept huge amounts of property from others.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Jianshun is 60 years old and served as chairman of Pien Tze Huang from 2014 to 2021. During this period, Pien Tze Huang’s revenue increased from 1.4 billion yuan to 6.5 billion yuan, and the stock price rose from 21 yuan/share to 4 in 2021. The monthly highest price is around 350 yuan/share. Three months after he left office, Pien Tze Huang experienced a period of intense speculation, with its stock price rising to a new high of 480 yuan per share, and Pien Tze Huang tablets on the market selling for thousands of yuan per pill. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2021, Liu Jianshun retired early due to &quot;personal physical reasons&quot; and resigned from relevant positions. Pan Jie, who had served as general manager of Pien Tze Huang and other positions, took over as chairman. But within eight months, Pan Jie resigned from the relevant position on the grounds of &quot;work adjustment.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the &quot;&lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;http://static.sse.com.cn/disclosure/listedinfo/announcement/c/new/2022-04-16/600436_20220416_6_1FsQWSqY. pdf&quot;>;Zhangzhou Pien Tze Huang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. 2021 Social Responsibility Report and ESG (Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance) Report&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&quot; mentioned that in 2021, Pien Tze Huang established the &quot;Zhangzhou Municipal Supervisory Committee in Office of the Ombudsman of Zhangzhou Pien Tze Huang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July of the same year, according to information on Pien Tze Huang’s official website, the Discipline Inspection and Supervision Offices of three Pien Tze Huang-owned enterprises, including Cosmetics Co., Ltd., were established, achieving full coverage of supervision of all public officials exercising public power in the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2021, Lin Weiqi, a member of the Party Committee and Deputy Director of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of Zhangzhou City, Fujian Province, became the new chairman of Pien Tze Huang. During his tenure from June to July 2022, the then secretary of the board of directors, deputy general manager, supervisor, chief engineer, and chief auditor resigned one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Less than 17 months after taking office, in July 2023, Lin Weiqi resigned from the company due to &quot;work adjustment&quot;. A month later, Lin Zhihui became Pien Tze Huang&#39;s new chairman. According to the announcement issued by Pien Tze Huang, Lin Zhihui has served as a member of the Standing Committee of the Zhangzhou Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and a member of the Zhangzhou Municipal Supervisory Committee. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taking stock of official notifications over the past year: In May, former chairman Pan Jie was subject to disciplinary review and supervisory investigation by the Zhangzhou Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision on suspicion of serious violations of discipline and law; in June, the former deputy director of Pien Tze Huang Cosmetics Co., Ltd. Chairman Yang Puquan was put on file for review and investigation for serious violations of disciplines and laws; in August, former chairman Lin Jinsheng of Pien Tze Huang Cosmetics Co., Ltd. was expelled from the party and public office for serious violations of disciplines and laws; at the end of August, former chairman Liu Jianshun was expelled from the party for serious violations of disciplines and laws. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In these intensive notifications, words such as &quot;relying on enterprises to eat enterprises&quot; and &quot;seeking personal gain&quot; were mentioned. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;More corruption problems occur in dealers&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;How much impact does frequent coaching changes have on the company? Pien Tze Huang&#39;s stock price has dropped from the highest of 482.33 yuan per share at the end of 2021 to the current price of 271.98 yuan per share, a drop of 43%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Bin believes that Pien Tze Huang has a very mature brand, system and customer base, so the role of management is relatively downplayed, and the replacement of senior executives will have little impact on the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the financial report, from 2020 to 2022, Pien Tze Huang’s revenue increased from 6.511 billion yuan to 8.694 billion yuan, and its net profit increased from 1.672 billion yuan to 2.472 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Bin said, &quot;Generally speaking, Pien Tze Huang&#39;s main sales channels are not in hospitals, but in pharmacies and the Internet.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the financial report, in 2021, Pien Tze Huang&#39;s operating income was 8.022 billion yuan, and sales expenses were 650 million yuan. In 2022, operating income was 8.694 billion yuan, and sales expenses were 483 million yuan. Selling expenses account for 8.1%-5.55% of revenue. In comparison, the IPO report of Hanwang Pharmaceutical, a traditional Chinese medicine pharmaceutical company, showed that sales expenses accounted for more than 80% of its main business revenue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Dingliang believes that traditional Chinese medicine is different from Western medicine and equipment. “The public relations focus of medical equipment and Western medicine is to have a good relationship with doctors and hospitals. But the corruption of traditional Chinese medicine in the C-end market is more about distribution. Corruption issues have arisen in the business chain.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the financial report, Pien Tze Huang’s domestic sales model is mainly OTC, that is, over-the-counter drugs. The main sales channel for prescription drugs is hospitals, and for over-the-counter drugs is pharmacies. Pien Tze Huang&#39;s sales channels include Pien Tze Huang experience centers, retail pharmacies and regional distributors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Pien Tze Huang Experience Center&quot; appeared for the first time in the 2015 financial report. There were more than 20 experience centers that year. By the end of 2020, there were more than 300 “Pien Tze Huang Experience Centers” operating across the country. According to a report by China International Finance Securities in August 2023, there are nearly 400 Pien Tze Huang experience centers across the country, covering more than 100,000 terminal stores. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Liang became the person in charge of a Pien Tze Huang experience center in 2019. In his view, the changes in Pien Tze Huang’s management will not have a big impact on the experience center he runs. In comparison, the impact of price increases is more direct. &quot;The market is indeed relatively weak now, and the experience center itself does not want to increase prices. After the price increase, sales will decline,&quot; he told a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although it is still growing, Pien Tze Huang&#39;s revenue growth rate in 2022 is the lowest in five years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2023, Pien Tze Huang stated that due to reasons such as the increase in main raw materials and labor costs, it would increase the domestic market retail price of its main product Pien Tze Huang tablets from 590 yuan/tablet to 760 yuan/tablet, and the supply price would be increased accordingly. About 170 yuan per pill, the largest price increase in history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Pien Tze Huang&#39;s 2003 prospectus, in 2000, the average domestic sales price of Pien Tze Huang was 93.2 yuan per pill. In twenty years, the price increase has been as high as 715%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the ex-factory price is 390 yuan/tablet, the market retail price of Pien Tze Huang tablets is 590 yuan/tablet. How much is the difference between the current ex-factory price and retail price of Pien Tze Huang tablets? Zhang Liang said, &quot;The ex-factory price is confidential, but our price difference is not high and cannot be compared with Moutai.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A long-term investor in Pien Tze Huang told a Southern Weekend reporter, &quot;This price adjustment (to 760 yuan), as far as I know, the ex-factory price should be 560 yuan.&quot; That is, the difference between the ex-factory price and the retail price is 200 yuan/pill, the same as before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person in charge of the Pien Tze Huang Experience Center who is familiar with Li Bin also believes that after the price increase, there will be a certain impact on sales within half a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Generally, sales will gradually return to normal after half a year. This year&#39;s price increase directly increases the ex-factory price and retail price by the same amount. In other words, the profit from the price increase belongs to Pien Tze Huang Company, and the profit It will be reflected in the performance, and the dealers will not make more money,&quot; Li Bin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the 2023 semi-annual report, the gross profit margin of Pien Tze Huang pharmaceutical manufacturing industry was 74.2%. In the 2022 annual report, this figure was 78.7%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person in charge of a traditional Chinese medicine company told a Southern Weekend reporter, &quot;The high profits of traditional Chinese medicine companies do not mean high profits for dealers. Products that can be sold at the C-end will not have much price difference.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“ &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Depend on the success of the enterprise &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;” &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;A senior person in the pharmaceutical industry told Southern Weekend Reporter, in terms of drug research and development, Pien Tze Huang is a national secret formula with mysterious origin and high price. It seems to be widely used, but the price/performance ratio is unclear, but the sales volume is very impressive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the official website of the State Drug Administration, the protection level of Pien Tze Huang is level 1, which is the highest level. Among the national traditional Chinese medicine varieties, only Pien Tze Huang and Yunnan Baiyao are national top-secret formulas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pien Tze Huang is now known as &quot;Moutai of Medicine&quot;, and the last one to be so called was Dong&#39;e Ejiao. From 2001 to the end of 2018, the price of Dong&#39;e Ejiao has been raised 18 times, an increase of 37 times. The reason for the price increase is &quot;the shortage of donkey skin resources.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person in charge of the above-mentioned traditional Chinese medicine company also used Dong&#39;e E-jiao as an example. The profits of Dong&#39;e E-jiao dealers are also very thin. If the dealers stock up, the company will give a slight discount. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The gameplay is to stock up downstream + increase prices. Frequent price increases are also because listed companies want to increase profits. I find Pien Tze Huang (price increases) a bit confusing, but only this type of company can have excess profits &quot;, he told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2018, Dong&#39;e Ejiao&#39;s growth has stagnated, and in 2019 it suffered its first loss in 23 years since its listing. From 2017 to 2019, the company&#39;s book inventory exceeded 3 billion yuan. It began cutting prices and selling stakes in its subsidiaries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2023, Dong&#39;e Ejiao (000423.SZ) issued continuous personnel change announcements. The then chairman and vice president both resigned due to &quot;job changes.&quot; This is the third chairman the company has replaced since November 2019. Similar to Pien Tze Huang, three chairmen resigned in three years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2020, nine senior executives including Qin Yufeng, the president of Dong&#39;e Ejiao, the assistant president, and the vice president resigned one after another. Two years later, Qin Yufeng was suspected of serious violations of discipline and law and is currently undergoing disciplinary review and supervisory investigation by the Discipline Inspection Commission of China Resources Pharmaceutical Holdings Co., Ltd. and the Supervisory Committee of Liaocheng City, Shandong Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar to them, there is Tongrentang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2021, when Pien Tze Huang was on the rise, Tongrentang (600085.SH) raised the terminal retail price of Angong Niuhuang Pills from 780 yuan to 860 yuan, saying it was due to the rise in raw materials for traditional Chinese medicine. Since then, many Prices of varieties have been raised one after another. Angong Niuhuang Pills is the core product of Tongrentang. In 2022, Tongrentang&#39;s revenue was 15.4 billion yuan, and the top five products, including Angong Niuhuang Pills, achieved revenue of 4.5 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2021, relevant reports published on the website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the State Supervisory Commission mentioned that Gao Zhenkun, the former general manager of Beijing Tongrentang, made more than 15 million yuan in profits from the purchase of raw materials for Angong Niuhuang Pills. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The article mentioned that when making Rentang’s signature patent medicines such as Angong Niuhuang Pills, Dahuoluo Pills, and Niuhuang Qingxin Pills, leopard bone, musk, antelope horn, bezoar and other ingredients are indispensable, and these are in high demand. , endangered fine materials with high profits, Gao Zhenkun saw huge space for rent-seeking power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During his tenure at Tongrentang Group Secondary Enterprise Co., Ltd., Gao Zhenkun firmly held the power to purchase fine materials and used his supply and information advantages to make private profits of more than 15 million yuan. In order to maintain the relationship with Gao Zhenkun, many suppliers competed to provide food and clothing for him. Gao Zhenkun could get the key to a two-bedroom rental house by casually saying, &quot;The children go to school far away.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relevant information about Wang Qingquan, the deputy general manager and operating branch manager of Tong Ren Tang, who accepted bribes published on the Judgment Documents website, mentioned that he took advantage of his position to repeatedly offer bribes to relevant parties at internal prices that were significantly lower than those stipulated by the group. Buy Angong Niuhuang Pills. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the currently released information on the investigation of relevant executives of Pien Tze Huang, &quot;depending on the enterprise to eat the enterprise&quot; has been mentioned many times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Lu Dingliang’s view, traditional Chinese medicine products are fields with many intermediate links, large profit margins, high professional and technical barriers, and insufficient procurement transparency. These characteristics provide room for corruption. At the same time, the method of transferring benefits in this field is relatively hidden, making it difficult to discover corrupt behaviors, obtain clues, and form evidence chains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“For traditional Chinese medicine, which faces the C-end market, the products are scarce and irreplaceable to a certain extent. If dealers obtain the right to sell, the profit margin will be relatively large, and they will provide a It’s possible,” he told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, Pien Tze Huang’s stock price once rose to 483.69 yuan/share. As of press time, it was reported at 269.81 yuan/share, a drop of more than 40%. But for Li Bin, a long-term holder of Pien Tze Huang, he is more optimistic about Pien Tze Huang&#39;s performance in half a year since the price increase in May. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(At the request of the interviewee, Zhang Liang’s pseudonym is used in the article.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br >;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/ a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[澳研究发现可致儿童痴呆症的145种遗传病]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257000]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-20 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Australian researchers recently identified 145 genetic diseases that can cause childhood dementia, aiming to improve the Awareness of the severity of these diseases.

Just like adults with dementia, children with dementia can experience memory loss, confusion, personality changes, severe sleep disturbances, and difficulties with concentration, comprehension, learning, and communication. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A research team led by the University of Adelaide in Australia conducted modeling and analysis of published data from this country and overseas. The results showed that symptoms of childhood dementia usually begin to appear when patients are two and a half years old. The average age at diagnosis is about four years. The average life expectancy of patients is only 9 years, and 70% of patients die before the age of 18. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers said that the 145 genetic diseases that cause childhood dementia are very complex and diverse, such as Krabbe disease, Sandhoff disease, Huntington&#39;s disease, etc., but the common point is that they all cause progressive Sexual neurocognitive decline and severely shortened life expectancy.

Yesterday I watched the movie &quot;&quot; adapted from Agatha&#39;s novel &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; finds director Kenneth Branagh starring as detective Poirot, who also plays Professor Niels Bohr in Nolan&#39;s latest film &quot;Oppenheimer.&quot; Oppenheimer thought that his tutor was too much and did not allow him to attend a long-awaited lecture. He injected potassium cyanide into the apple. The next day he remembered that he ran away and found the apple in the hands of Professor Bohr. When Bohr was about to eat, Oppenheimer stopped him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to understand human despair? Oppenheimer was desperate at that moment. The taste of a good movie will make people imagine. My family said that before he met me, he was on vacation in South France. He thought that life was unpredictable, his heart was empty and he had no cares. He walked toward the river, and was discovered by his friends and caught on the river bank. Not long after, he met me at a birthday party in England. He said that your hair was half long and half short at that time, which was very avant-garde. I say people are like this. If you are extremely miserable inside and don’t live a decent life, you will use external forms to dilute the pain, such as intentionally or unintentionally tending to be abnormal, or even clothes and shoes. Good guy, I wore high heels for many years. With such irregular hair. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, you don’t have a tattoo. He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If I had a tattoo, would you still fall in love with me? I asked him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said, even if you had, I would never have been disgusted with you at that time. When people meet at the right time, everything will be forgiven and tolerated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This made me think deeply. So many things have happened in the past three years, and everyone&#39;s destiny has changed. I used to be a fetishist. Everywhere I went, I would collect souvenirs, ranging from a small piece of porcelain to a large sculpture. I loved looking for old postcards and stamps at antique flea markets. One year I attended the Frankfurt Book Fair, and I happily walked around the largest open-air market in the area with my friends. When I saw an old carpet with a silver spoon, I took it without a counter-offer. Now I won&#39;t accept it. There are so many things outside my body and it&#39;s so tiring. Except for books, I don’t throw them away. From last year to this year, I have been cleaning out necessary and unnecessary items, extra pots, bowls, chopsticks, extra clothes, shoes and furniture. The house gradually became a little empty, and I felt relieved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Being alive is better than anything else. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This movie and this story &quot;Moonlight Samurai&quot; was the first time I heard it from my family and neighbors when I was five years old. A family was walking on the wide and long stone steps of Middle School Street. The mother above was wearing a kimono. We have to return to Japan. Below is the father and his three daughters rushing behind. On both sides of the stone steps are people watching. Decades passed, and that scene kept flashing in my mind. From this, I wrote a short story of less than 3,000 words, and then rewritten it into a script of 50,000 words, and then changed the script into a novel of more than 200,000 words. Every character came alive in my heart. After the novel was published, I broke down the previous script and rewrote it. Each scene was based on the actual situation and actors were found according to the image of the characters in the script. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The early stage of a movie involves script preparation, preparation of funds and team, and then shooting. The later stage involves editing, sound, music, and color grading and special effects. The early stage is difficult, and the late stage is even more difficult. Many people will lose patience during this process. I strive to absorb fresh professional knowledge, research and think, so that my hearing, smell, and intuition are always in a sharp state. It’s like walking from one distant country to another. You must first determine the location, plan the route, prepare the equipment needed along the way, and then put aside all worries. No one can dissuade you. They all say that the road ahead is a trap, a pit, and a road of no return. , but I don’t believe it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Strong wind and heavy rain? This happens too often and there is no need to be afraid. Robbers appear on the road, beggars appear on the road, and smiling tigers appear on the road. Tang Monk, when you go to the West to obtain Buddhist scriptures, you meet monsters who want to eat your flesh in order to live forever. As for me, everything I encounter is God’s way of testing my sincerity towards movies. The film is so bitter and hard that it is completely inedible and must be swallowed whole. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/jMsUG4dRkoKT9WR4Q0OnBQP75lqpYKXZLydTKIQG.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;949&quot; height= &quot;607&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/jMsUG4dRkoKT9WR4Q0OnBQP75lqpYKXZLydTKIQG.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251099&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The heroine Qin Jiahui of &quot;Moonlight Warrior&quot; is a nurse who first met Dou Xiaoming, a 12-year-old boy at work.

Many of his fans urged &quot;Moonlight Samurai&quot; to be released as soon as possible on Weibo, and even said unpleasant things. I expressed my opinion on Weibo, saying that the cycle of making movies is not what they imagined. The filming of this movie was at the end of 2021, and the post-production period was a year, because during the epidemic, many of the post-production companies, including the main creators, were in isolation. It has only been less than three months since our film received the Dragon Award. We have been doing follow-up work and looking for the most suitable promotion company. It’s not that we don’t want to go to theaters and meet the audience as soon as possible. The tweet attracted polarizing comments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In depression, I recalled my favorite Chinese and foreign movies, and thought of the scene in &quot;Tunnel War&quot; in which the Japanese invaded the village and were beaten and fled; I thought of the figure running in the wilderness in &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;; I think of the piano music in &quot;Casablanca&quot;; I think of the charming desert in &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;; I think of the long shot of the boy finally walking to the seaside in &quot;The 400 Blows&quot;, the endless sea and the cloudless sky; I think of the endless sea and cloudless sky; In &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; the heroine walks down the stairs with rays of sunshine.

We were such good friends and relatives. Because of making this movie, I I have lost you, and I have also lost my eldest sister who was born to the same mother. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yes, I have encountered many things that make me inexplicably sad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From time to time I meet people asking me why I didn’t contact him/her before making a movie? Claiming that if I find him/her, my movie will have stars, funding, and will have greater commercial value. I said, if I come to you then, you will not pay attention to me. If you pay attention to me, it is not too late to extend a hand to me now. This kind of people say that the first-rate movies in the world are those with a cost of more than 500 million; the second-rate movies are those with less than 500 million, with big productions and big actors; and the third-rate movies are small productions with no stars. Hong Ying, you are making this third-rate movie. You are a writer, and it is your duty to be a writer. You want to promote your movie, which is just nonsense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I interrupted the other person: What I do is my business, and are you talking about a movie? You&#39;re talking about money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Money can produce movies. There is no first-rate, second-rate or third-rate money. Money is money, but money never equals movies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Film is art, the seventh art, Giotto. Kanudu said that film is a comprehensive art that includes static art and moving art, time art and space art, plastic art and rhythm art. Movies use lenses to tell stories, tell a story about a person who is gradually forgotten, tell long-standing legends, tell historical truths, and use visual and sound effects to tell the story of justice and ideal spirit that existed in long ago. Movies are about realizing impossible dreams. Movies use It’s just about making dreams. Without dreams, how can we make movies? How to watch movies?

I often ask myself, and I am also asked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many times it feels like the movie has entered my body, sucking my blood and aura. Do I walk into the river with stones in my arms? But the movie wouldn&#39;t let go of me, so I had no choice but to look back. I saw that when I was a child, I and my father were sitting on the bank of the Yangtze River, watching the boats sailing on the river. They were all in fixed focus, and they came to me frame by frame. They were the world. This world was not as gray and dark as the one I lived on the south bank of the river. Hopeless, so poor, this world has bright colors and hope, endless passion and love on the other side of the river. This is a movie that will always belong to those who are indomitable, believe in the good side of the world, and never lose the ability to love others and the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was dreaming that night, and I was standing on the Chongqing riverside again, together with the executive director, waiting for the ship to ship the filming equipment. Mist comes. I walked forward, the river flowed carefully, I could hear my own footsteps, and I saw an abandoned cable car in front of me. It was exactly the same as the one I had walked along the river thousands of times when I was a child. There was even a bridge hole. I walked over and immediately Walking back from the cave, I saw the fog dissipating, and the mountains, houses and some factory sheds on the other side were looming. The river was green and rippling with waves. Looking to the left, I saw the scenery of the Jialing River to the left of Chaotianmen in the center of Chongqing. I was extremely excited, and there was a wide beach on the right. I pointed there and said to the people around me, why should we go to the opposite side to shoot that fight scene? No, it is right here. This is the scene I was most familiar with when I was a child. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Somehow, I feel that this is a gift from Chongqing, where I was born and raised, to my firm heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I woke up and clearly remembered that it was a morning in the winter of 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two years, it seems like a long time, it seems like a blink of an eye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While writing this article, I read a Weibo post by Xiaofeng, the host of &quot;Xiaofeng Live Room&quot; on Weibo: &quot;&quot;Moonlight Samurai&quot; is really the most mysterious movie of the year, directed by the internationally renowned Hong Ying, winner of the Rome Prize for Literature, adapted it from her own novel and directed it for the first time. She loved this story so much. Pamuk liked &quot;The Museum of Innocence&quot;, but he just built a museum with limited time and space. It is unimaginable. He picked Füsun and Kemal by himself and let them sway in the old streets of Istanbul, but Hongying did it. She not only hypnotized us on paper, but followed Dou Xiaoming and Qin Jiahui into the winding mountain city Xiejie, also put their stories on the screen, allowing the dense atmosphere of the mountain city and the majestic beauty of the river to flow through our eyes. Congratulations to &quot;Moonlight Samurai&quot; for being nominated for the Best Screenplay Award at the Hollywood Next Generation Independent Film Award. This Another piece of much-anticipated good news.&#39; The film awards&#39; highest honor goes to outstanding storytellers and visionary filmmakers from around the world.&#39; Outstanding storytellers, yes, that five The girl who ran and shouted in the drizzle by the Yangtze River when she was young, the daughter who only found out about the river where she was born at the age of eighteen and has determined her life since then, she has always been the woman who lives by telling stories like Scheherazade!&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her words touched the softest part of my heart. Even if one person sees my walking track or notices my movies, I should be grateful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like Dou Xiaoming and Qin Jiahui, I was swaying on the steepest stone staircase in the mountain city. I saw the city lights pouring on the river little by little, and the tugboat came from the darkened confluence of the two rivers. , sounding the air horn, and someone holding a loudspeaker shouted, &quot;Stop at Pier 2,&quot; and then used local swear words in Chongqing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s such a familiar scene. It’s not someone else’s tugboat, it’s my father’s. From the old photos he showed me, I know its appearance and shape. Of course, it has long since become a pile of waste. Iron, but I imagined it appearing on the river more than a hundred times. I resurrected it in the movie and made it exist forever. My father, I believe that you will see this movie in Tianzhiling. This movie pays tribute to Chongqing and Chongqing people. It also pays tribute to foreigners and foreigners like you. Father, I believe that you will see this movie.

The article said that according to incomplete statistics, almost all car 4S stores within the Third Ring Road of Shijiazhuang City are involved, and there are more than 100 dealers of various brands. The large-scale relocation and reconstruction are expected to cause direct economic losses of more than 1 billion to the dealers. Yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 15, &quot;Automotive Business Review&quot; magazine reported that according to statistics from the Shijiazhuang Commerce Bureau, the relocation involved 177 sizable 4S stores, affecting almost all 4S stores in Shijiazhuang. The notice, stamped with the bright red seals of the local Natural Resources and Planning Bureau, the Public Security Bureau, the Urban Management Bureau, the Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau, the Fire Rescue and the Subdistrict Office, requires that all 4S stores be relocated and vacated before September 30, and the stores must be closed. , those who do not move into the automobile industrial park must close their stores before September 10th; temporary and illegal 4S stores must be demolished by themselves before September 10th, otherwise they will be demolished by force; &quot;Refuse to cooperate, maliciously obstruct and hinder the execution of official duties&quot; &quot; will be &quot;seriously dealt with in accordance with the law, and those suspected of committing crimes will be held criminally responsible in accordance with the law.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, demolition work has begun, and many car brand showrooms have been razed to the ground in the Hebei International Automobile Trade Park, the largest local automobile park. According to reports, the relocation of automobile 4S stores was carried out in the name of &quot;comprehensive improvement of temporary (illegal construction) low-end market&quot;: the government requires existing 4S stores to be closed and demolished, and relocated to four new parks planned by the government. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not uncommon in various places to require companies to relocate to new parks planned by the government under various pretexts. A few years ago, a county in eastern Shandong Province required all stone companies in a town famous for stone production to relocate to a newly built &quot;stone industrial park&quot; in the name of &quot;industrial agglomeration.&quot; A few years later, on the grounds of &quot;air pollution control&quot;, all barbecue restaurants in the county were required to move to the newly built &quot;BBQ Street&quot;. If you don&#39;t want to relocate, then close without negotiation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same is true for the car 4S store in Shijiazhuang that &quot;requires time-limited relocation&quot;. Once a document is issued by the city government, the district and sub-district offices will enforce it. If they are unwilling to relocate, they will close the store and demolish it. However, the expenses and costs associated with relocation, as well as the possible impact on industrial development, need to be calculated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What impact may relocation have on companies and industries? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, of course, the renovated business premises must be abandoned and moved to a new location. Not to mention the rent, renovating is a huge expense. According to an estimate from an article by the China Automobile Dealers Association, each new store after the centralized relocation is expected to require an additional construction investment of 10 million to 20 million yuan. In recent years, car sales have dropped from their peak, especially due to the impact of the epidemic. Many dealers were already struggling to survive until the epidemic was relaxed, and they are planning to take advantage of the opportunity to develop their business. Some stores even just opened a few months ago, and were required to dismantle and relocate the store before selling a few cars. The tens of millions of yuan invested just now were in vain. It was difficult for the store owners to invest more funds in the construction of new stores, so they had to Forced into bankruptcy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some shop owners questioned the procedural issues. According to a report by Shijiazhuang Daily in June, the policy formulated at the special meeting of the Municipal Party Committee at that time was to &quot;build first and then destroy&quot;. First, ensure that the new automobile industrial park is completed and put into use by the end of September, and then complete &quot;overdue temporary construction and illegal construction&quot; in October. &quot;4S store relocation and renovation. However, in actual implementation, &quot;establish first and then destroy&quot; has become &quot;first break and then establish&quot;. According to reports, the four new parks currently planned are still under construction. Even if work is rushed 24/7, it will be difficult to complete before the end of September. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Part of the reason why Shijiazhuang City proposed the relocation and rectification of 4S stores is that some current 4S stores have problems such as &quot;extended temporary construction and illegal construction&quot; and are a &quot;low-end market&quot; that need &quot;rectification and improvement.&quot; In fact, the current automobile 4S stores in Shijiazhuang City are relatively concentrated in four parks. Some of these parks are automobile industrial parks previously planned by the government, and some are actively gathered and formed spontaneously during the market development process. The location selection of these stores was a decision made by dealers after investigating factors such as the business district environment and customer needs, and was also in line with the municipal planning at the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Requiring time-limited relocation&quot; affects not only 4S stores, but also the millions of existing car owners in Shijiazhuang, as well as new car owners who are preparing to buy cars. Officials require almost all 4S stores to close before the end of September. It is not yet known when the new park will be completed. Even if the new park is built, and even if the 4S store has the money to relocate, the decoration of the new store will usually take at least two to three months. There will be a window of several months in between. During this period, let alone citizens being unable to buy new cars, it is even difficult to ensure vehicle maintenance and repairs for old car owners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2023, the central government issued the &quot;31 Articles on the Private Economy&quot;, which requires optimizing the development environment of the private economy, protecting the property rights of private enterprises and the rights and interests of entrepreneurs in accordance with the law, and promoting the development and growth of the private economy. The Hebei Province Private Economy Leading Group also announced the &quot;Hebei Province Private Economy Development Work Points in 2023&quot; in April 2023, proposing to continue to optimize the business environment. As for optimizing the business environment, the most fundamental thing is probably not to provide enterprises with various industrial guidance and policy preferences, but to reduce interference in the market, respect the property rights of enterprises and the autonomy of entrepreneurs, and allow entrepreneurs to make market decisions independently. Only with more services and less guidance, more support and less trouble can the private economy develop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[证监会再出“新招”规范上市公司分红强化制度约束和激励]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256974]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-20 11:30:49&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;It is the common wish of investors to obtain higher dividends within a reasonable range. On September 18, a reporter from 21st Century Business Herald learned that the China Securities Regulatory Commission plans to launch a series of measures to improve the normalized dividend mechanism for listed companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, the China Securities Regulatory Commission has introduced and implemented a &quot;linking&quot; policy between dividends and shareholding reductions. Listed companies have not distributed cash dividends in the past three years, or the cumulative cash dividend amount is less than 30% of the average annual net profit in the past three years. , controlling shareholders and actual controllers are not allowed to reduce their holdings of the company’s shares through the secondary market. According to the person in charge of the relevant department of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, it is planned to further strengthen institutional constraints on companies that do not pay dividends or pay small dividends to urge dividends, promote the optimization of dividend methods and rhythm, so that companies that pay dividends can get more incentives, and at the same time, strengthen the supervision of companies that exceed their ability to pay dividends. constraints, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that the amount of dividends paid and the proportion of A-share companies ranked among the top in the world. Data show that in the past five years, the amount of dividends paid by A-share listed companies has increased year by year, with a cumulative dividend of 8.2 trillion yuan, and the amount of dividends has exceeded the amount of financing that year. In 2022, a total of 3,291 Shanghai and Shenzhen listed companies in my country&#39;s domestic market paid cash dividends, accounting for 67.1% of the total number of listed companies at the end of 2022. The total cash dividends for the year reached 2.06 trillion yuan, of which the amount of dividends attributed to A-share shareholders was 1.62 Trillion yuan. From an international comparison, the number of dividend-paying listed companies in the domestic market ranks first among the world&#39;s major securities markets, the total amount of cash dividends ranks second in the world, and the proportion of dividend-paying companies ranks second in the world. In addition, 163 listed companies announced cash dividend plans for their 2023 semi-annual reports, with dividends expected to be 203.01 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/4cc2cabe70cda1d4f140901286cc0992.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;675&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/4cc2cabe70cda1d4f140901286cc0992.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251172&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;h4>;Mature companies with continuous improvement in dividends, and companies listed on the main board have a higher proportion of dividends&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In recent years, the sustainability and growth of dividends of listed companies in my country have continued to improve. Data shows that as of 2022, the proportion of companies that have paid dividends for five consecutive years has increased from 20% ten years ago to 48%, and the proportion of companies that have paid dividends for 10 consecutive years has increased from 8% to 31%; 412 listed companies have paid dividends continuously. The proportion of companies that have grown in three years has increased from 3% ten years ago to 12%, and the proportion of companies that have grown in five consecutive years has increased from 1% to 4%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dividend yield and dividend payout ratio also show a fluctuating upward trend. The dividend yield distribution range has gradually increased from 0.5%-1.5% before 2010 to the current 1.5%-2%. In 2022, the average dividend payout rate in my country&#39;s domestic market is 32.5%, and the average dividend rate is 1.97%, which is in the middle and upper reaches of major global markets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Which sectors and industries pay higher dividends? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Industry insiders believe that dividend features are generally in line with the company’s development stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of sectors, the dividend payout rate of main board companies is the highest, reaching about 33%, which is 8 percentage points higher than the Science and Technology Innovation Board and GEM. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of industries, industries with stable performance and low investment demand tend to have higher dividend ratios. Judging from the average dividend payout ratio, energy, major consumption, and public utilities rank among the top three, with dividend ratios as high as 50%, 48%, and 45% respectively. Listed companies in these industries have low new investment needs and relatively stable cash flow. Hence the average dividend payout level is higher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the contrary, the real estate, industry, and information technology industries have greater investment demand, and the average dividend payout ratio is also lower, at 28%, 26%, and 25% respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the dividend level of A-share companies in the start-up and growth stages is lower than that of companies in the mature stage. Due to their relatively weak financing capabilities and strong willingness to save and defend, private enterprises have slightly lower dividend levels than state-owned enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Whether a high proportion of dividends is reasonable or not needs to be viewed comprehensively and accurately&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Dividends of listed companies need to comprehensively consider multiple factors such as profitability, cash flow, debt, growth stage, development goals, etc. Different types of The attitudes and demands of shareholders towards cash dividends are not completely consistent, and it is necessary to balance the interests of the company and shareholders, major shareholders and small shareholders.&quot; The interviewed experts believe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the opinion of this expert, whether a company can pay dividends and how much it pays are mainly affected by three factors: first, the undistributed profits accumulated by the company from its operations in the current year and in the past; second, the cash it currently has; It is whether the retained earnings can meet the company&#39;s future development needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The dividend ratio needs to be determined comprehensively based on the company&#39;s profitability, development stage, and future development needs. According to industry insiders, whether a company pays dividends and how much it pays are not necessarily linked to the profit of the year. Although the dividend ratio of some companies in individual years is relatively high, it is still reasonable. This must be comprehensively analyzed and viewed accurately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, some companies have stable profits and cash flow and have little investment demand, so they maintain a high dividend payout ratio. On the other hand, some companies will keep the amount of dividends unchanged despite declining profits or losses, and stabilize investor expectations through continued dividend payments, which will lead to higher dividend payout ratios in certain years. At the same time, in order to reduce redundant funds, some companies will implement special dividends based on accumulated undistributed profits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Experts interviewed believe that, of course, it is not ruled out that major shareholders may distribute dividends arbitrarily and hollow out the company regardless of the company&#39;s future development needs. This should be strengthened, but this should be a very small number. To judge whether dividends are reasonable, we need to start from three dimensions: first, we need to see whether the profits are real and whether there is fraud; secondly, we need to see where the cash comes from and whether it is borrowed money to distribute dividends; finally, we must make a comprehensive judgment based on the motivation of major shareholders to pay dividends. A high proportion of dividends cannot be equated with dividends beyond capacity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Therefore, we need to view high-proportion dividends comprehensively and accurately. On the one hand, we must identify dividends based on false profits at the expense of the interests of listed companies; on the other hand, we welcome dividends based on the company’s true profit level and development needs. A high proportion of dividends that can effectively return investors.&quot; said an industry insider. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Four aspects will be followed to further standardize dividends of listed companies&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Recently, the China Securities Regulatory Commission plans to review the &quot;Supervisory Guidelines for Listed Companies No. 3 - Cash Dividends of Listed Companies&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Dividend Guidelines&quot;) ) &quot;Guidelines on Articles of Association of Listed Companies&quot; (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Guidelines on Articles of Association&quot;) and other rules have been revised. On the basis of the &quot;linking policy&quot; for dividends and shareholding reductions that have been introduced in the early stage, we will continue to improve and optimize the cash dividend supervision system and strengthen information disclosure supervision. , conveniently optimize the mid-term dividend payment process, better play the role of investment side, and continue to enhance investors’ sense of gain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the head of the relevant department of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, this policy adjustment will proceed from four aspects:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, strengthen institutional constraints and urge companies to pay dividends that do not pay dividends or pay small dividends. The first is to strengthen information disclosure supervision. For companies listed on the main board that do not pay a certain proportion of dividends, they are required to disclose and explain the reasons. The second is to strengthen disclosure requirements for companies with large financial investments, and urge companies to improve the efficiency of asset use and better focus on the main business and return investors. The third is to strengthen inquiries and supervisory interviews. Strengthen regulatory inquiries to help investors make better judgments on dividend information, and urge more dividends through interviews and other methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, promote further optimization of dividend methods and rhythm. Specific measures in this regard can be summarized in two points: First, simplify the mid-term dividend payment procedures to facilitate the company to further increase the frequency of dividends and allow investors to better plan capital arrangements. Second, guide the company to formulate a dividend policy for stable growth. Promote companies to amend their articles of association to improve the operability of dividend policies; guide companies to explore dividend distribution policies with stable growth and reward investors with more stable dividends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, let companies with good dividends receive more rewards and &quot;taste the sweetness.&quot; On the one hand, it gives more &quot;honor&quot; to companies that pay good dividends. The exchange will study how to further favor high dividend-paying companies in the evaluation of information disclosure; the Listed Companies Association will study and optimize the preparation method of listed companies&#39; dividend lists and increase publicity efforts to guide companies to establish a correct value orientation. On the other hand, promote the development of more influential dividend index products; encourage fund companies to issue dividend fund products, and guide market funds to increase their preference for cash dividends from listed companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, strengthen restrictions on companies that pay dividends beyond their capabilities. Although paying dividends beyond capacity is not a prominent problem in A-shares, the China Securities Regulatory Commission will still pay close attention to it and take multiple measures to strengthen prevention. The first is to work hard to ensure that the company&#39;s performance is true and the basis for dividends is solid, and to effectively prevent listed companies from falsifying their finances and financing dividends. Second, for listed companies that have high asset-liability ratios and insufficient operating cash flow, but continue to pay dividends at a high proportion, detailed disclosure of the rationality of the dividend plan and its impact on the company&#39;s production and operations is required. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 11:55:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
