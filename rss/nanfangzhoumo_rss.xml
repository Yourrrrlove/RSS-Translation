A lawsuit announcement by Shanghai Lujiazui Financial and Trade Zone Development Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Lujiazui&quot;) on November 4 aroused heated discussions among netizens. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This incident is not a simple dispute between companies. As more details were revealed, the case quickly became a hot topic on November 8. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/06c5147bd39693df46185ad16eaff961.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;444&quot; height=&quot;211&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/06c5147bd39693df46185ad16eaff961.png&quot; data-key=&quot;257624 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;There are three main points that make the majority of netizens &quot;eat melons&quot;:&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;First, Lujiazui sued five units, among which the most Involving Jiangsu government departments. Lujiazui disclosed in the announcement that due to soil pollution problems, its subsidiaries have transferred Jiangsu Suzhou Iron and Steel Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Suzhou Iron and Steel Group&quot;), Suzhou Environmental Science Institute, Suzhou Suzhou Environmental Technology Co., Ltd., Suzhou National The High-tech Industrial Development Zone Management Committee and the Suzhou Municipal Natural Resources and Planning Bureau went to court and recently received a written case acceptance notice from the Jiangsu Provincial Higher People&#39;s Court;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The second is Lujiazui’s claim amount is as high as 10 billion yuan.

The land purchased in Lujiazui was purchased in 2016, but the contaminated land was not discovered until 2022. By this time, a large number of businesses had been built. Did the pollutants affect the construction workers? Why has no problem of excessive pollution been found during construction site operations for 6 years? Have you tried other options before filing a lawsuit? Wait for questions to follow&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;span>;On the afternoon of November 8, the Securities Affairs Department of Lujiazui Company responded to Nandu Bay Financial News: &quot;We have disclosed all matters related to soil pollution disputes in the announcement. , are not accepting interviews at the moment. Regarding the status of the projects such as the Reading School that have been delivered, from the perspective of disclosure, we do not need to disclose it. We will make an announcement if there is any progress in the follow-up matter.&quot; Nanduwan Financial Society also called the above five defendants, but As of press time, the call had not been connected. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many industry insiders told reporters from Wancaishe that complex interests are involved behind the &quot;poisonous land&quot;, and the relevant departments of the Shanghai and Jiangsu governments should handle related issues rationally and prevent produce sequelae. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;After spending 8.5 billion in 222 rounds of bidding, &lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Lujiazui bought 14 “poisonous sites”? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The incident originated from Lujiazui’s strategic decision to “go global” 7 years ago. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 2016, Lujiazui’s designated holding subsidiaries Jiawan Company and Jiaer Company (through a trust plan) formed a consortium and jointly bid for the listing of Suzhou Iron and Steel Group Co., Ltd. on the Shanghai United Equity Exchange. 95% of the equity of Green&#39;an Company was transferred. The main assets under the name of Green&#39;an Company are 17 land use rights located north of Sutong Road and east of Sugang Road in Suzhou High-tech Zone. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/6470f097007bb2896cb1498aab01a0d2.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;574&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/6470f097007bb2896cb1498aab01a0d2.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257622 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;The development history of Suzhou Iron and Steel Group.

After 222 rounds of bidding, it attracted Greenland, Poly , Shimao, Vanke, China Merchants and many other real estate companies participated in the bidding. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Lujiazui finally won 95% of the equity of Suzhou Green Bank Real Estate Development Co., Ltd. for a total price of 8.525 billion yuan (transaction price of 6.84 billion yuan, debt of 1.685 billion yuan). &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Lujiazui, which has defeated many powerful real estate companies, is also quite confident about the success of this auction. At that time, the group publicly stated that the successful joint bid for 95% of the shares of Suzhou Green Bank would be conducive to further increasing the company&#39;s land reserves and expanding the company&#39;s development space. &quot;By actively implementing the &#39;going global&#39; strategy, we will further enhance the brand influence of Lujiazui commercial real estate and enhance The company&#39;s sustainable operating ability and profitability.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;However, Lujiazui&#39;s bold &quot;going out&quot; investment decision was not so smooth sailing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 2021, news spread that Suzhou Green Bank accidentally discovered that some plots of the project had serious pollution risks, and a report was made to the local government departments. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In April 2022, the &quot;Processing Status of the Sixth Batch of Letters and Calls Transferred to Our Province by the Second Central Ecological and Environmental Protection Inspection Team&quot; announced on the official website of the Jiangsu Provincial People&#39;s Government mentioned Recently, the test results of a third-party testing agency showed that benzopyrene and naphthalene in the soil of many plots of the Suzhou Green Bank project seriously exceeded the standards and did not meet the land use standards. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It also mentioned that the Suzhou High-tech Zone Management Committee attached great importance to it, established a special work team, and quickly started work, requiring Suzhou Green Bank to effectively perform its main responsibilities. Before the end of June, a third-party agency will be entrusted to complete the formulation of a soil pollution investigation plan, and the organization and implementation will be organized and implemented. Related work will be carried out in accordance with the law based on the investigation results. During this period, the above-mentioned plots shall not carry out any activities unrelated to the prevention and control of soil pollution. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the same month, Lujiazui also issued an announcement stating that 8 of the 17 plots of land have been developed. It was unexpectedly discovered that plots 2 and 13 where educational facilities have been built and plots 3 and 4 that have not been developed yet have serious pollution risks. Many elements in the soil or groundwater greatly exceed the standards and do not meet the original requirements of these plots. According to the planned land use standards, the total area of ​​the four plots is approximately 118,000 square meters. As of the end of 2021, the cumulative project investment in the four plots is approximately 450 million yuan&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Due to the exposure of land pollution problems, the Lujiazui project had to be stopped. &lt;span>;Public information shows that the above-mentioned land No. 2 and land No. 13, where the pollution was determined, are planned to build Suzhou Reading School and a kindergarten respectively. &lt;/span>;When they were named by the Central Second Ecological Environmental Protection Inspection Group in 2022, the two plots of land had been completed. According to media reports, due to pollution problems, Suzhou Reading School failed to welcome its first batch of new students in September 2021 as scheduled, and the students of the school are transitioning to Suzhou Science and Technology City Foreign Language School. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/d980d31c5b1e354c588b40313463a985.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;660&quot; height=&quot;467&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/d980d31c5b1e354c588b40313463a985.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257627 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Aerial view of Suzhou Reading School.

The infringements together resulted in the plaintiff receiving the land involved in the case that was seriously polluted. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Lujiazui requested that the defendant be ordered to pay compensation of RMB 10.044 billion to the plaintiff (if it is subsequently discovered or clear that the actual amount is higher than this amount, the lawsuit will be increased or a separate lawsuit will be filed) Responsibility; request a ruling to order defendants 2, 3, 4 and 5 to bear joint and several liability for the claim in item 1; request a ruling to order that the litigation costs of this case shall be jointly borne by all defendants. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This lawsuit with a claim amount of up to 10 billion yuan quickly aroused heated discussion in the market. According to estimates by industry insiders, based on a fee of 0.5%, the litigation costs in Lujiazui may exceed 50 million. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/24e0ac78e19d13eb4da0c064a2a137f3.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;677&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/24e0ac78e19d13eb4da0c064a2a137f3.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257630 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;span>;As for the reason why Lujiazui sued for large compensation, Wang Yuchen, director of Beijing Jinliu Law Firm, told reporters that the main reason is that it may face pollution problems on the land where the construction project is located. Huge legal risks and legal liabilities, and the Suzhou Iron and Steel Group, appraisal institutions, etc. in this incident will also have corresponding legal risks and legal liabilities. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It further stated that as far as Lujiazui Group is concerned, according to the current information, it has a large scale of construction, many types of projects, and a huge amount of capital investment in the land involved in the case. , and related projects were found to have serious pollution in the land during construction, completion, sales and other aspects. Construction suspension, completion acceptance failure, sales suspension, rectification and repair, re-appraisal, etc. are all problems that Lujiazui Group is currently facing or will need to face in the future. Behind this, only in terms of civil liability, there is the risk of breach of contract in various contracts such as construction contracts signed with construction units and house purchase contracts signed with owners. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;A claim of 10 billion yuan, what is the probability of winning? &lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Wang Yuchen told reporters that if Suzhou Iron and Steel Group knew about the land contamination of the relevant land parcels at the time of the transfer and had the obligation to know but failed to perform it, it would Intentional concealment, etc. may not only affect the validity of the previous contract, but also face corresponding liability for breach of contract. For the losses that Lujiazui Group needs to bear, Lujiazui Group also has the right to recover from Suzhou Iron and Steel Group; in addition, if the appraisal agency investigates the case There are cases of fraudulent identification involving soil pollution, and they also face legal risks and liabilities. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;First, it will involve civil compensation risks, and may bear joint liability with Suzhou Steel and other entities; &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;span>;Second, it will face administrative The risk of punishment is that you may face administrative penalties such as warnings, fines, confiscation of illegal income, and revocation of corresponding qualifications;&lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;span>;Third, if the circumstances are serious, the relevant responsible personnel may also be guilty of providing false certification documents, etc. Criminal offenses, criminal liability. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Zhou Zhengfeng, a lawyer at Guangdong Huashang Law Firm, also told reporters that if the investigation proves that the soil pollution involved in the case was falsified, Lujiazui may win the case. But the case may eventually be mediated. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Of course, in addition to the current lawsuit, this case will also require corresponding solutions in the future. Issues such as how to deal with developed land are more worthy of attention. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Lujiazui behind the “poisonous land” case:&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Revenue and net profit dropped&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In addition to paying attention to the case itself, the incident also caused netizens to worry about Lujiazui’s business conditions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As of November 8, Lujiazui’s market value was 44.76 billion yuan. Perhaps due to the huge impact of the case, the company’s stock price fell 0.75% that day to 9.30 yuan per share. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“You can’t recover the cost even if you win the lawsuit” “The claim amount of 10 billion is equivalent to 22% of the market value” “Is there no money for development?” Some investors responded to the incident They have a negative attitude, believing that Lujiazui is also facing operating difficulties during the real estate downturn cycle; but some netizens also have a positive attitude, &quot;Lujiazui&#39;s attitude is not bad. Investors are more assured when such things happen, and proactive disclosure of information makes investors feel more at ease.&quot; &quot;Lujiazui still has a conscience. No more false reports were issued to defraud property owners into purchasing their homes.” &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>; Regarding whether the case will have an impact on the company’s operations, Lujiazui mentioned in an announcement on November 4 that the case is still in the filing and acceptance stage, and it is temporarily unable to judge whether it will affect the company’s operations. The impact on the company’s profits for the current period or subsequent periods. According to relevant media reports, Lujiazui Chairman Xu Erjin said at the performance briefing on November 6 that the company’s special working group is going all out to carry out disposal and rights protection work, and promote relevant responsible parties to assume subsequent disposal responsibilities. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Xu Erjin also emphasized at the performance meeting that in the future, the company will pay close attention to the market situation in the Yangtze River Delta, choose opportunities to participate, continue to actively support the integrated development and construction of the Yangtze River Delta, and continue to strengthen Optimize the company&#39;s main business. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Although the company still has confidence in investment, it is undeniable that from the data point of view, Lujiazui has experienced a continuous double decline in operating income and net profit. According to the financial report, in 2022, Lujiazui achieved revenue of 11.762 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 15.21%; net profit was 1.085 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 74.84%; revenue in the first three quarters of 2023 was approximately 5.775 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 14.48%; attributable to listing The company&#39;s shareholders&#39; net profit was approximately 837 million yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 27.75%. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The decline in Lujiazui’s performance is not unrelated to the fact that the current real estate market is still at a trough. In the first three quarters of this year, the national real estate development investment was 8,726.9 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 9.1%; the commercial housing sales area was 848.06 million square meters, a year-on-year decrease of 7.5%. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“Land pollution has devalued, the real estate market has declined, and forced development is unprofitable.” Some people in the industry believe that the main reason for this case to surface is due to multiple factors Impact. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The emergence of this case also triggered a new round of discussion on land development in the real estate industry. &quot;In the past 20 years of working in the industry, I have never seen a lawsuit like the tens of billions of land withdrawals due to soil pollution.&quot; Zhang Hongwei, founder of Jingjian Consulting, said that the lawsuit has involved the two governments, so it is not easy to handle. However, the &quot;poisonous land&quot; has been delayed for seven years. It is hoped that through the coordination of relevant departments in Shanghai and Jiangsu, this problem can be fundamentally solved. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Yan Yuejin, research director of Yiju Research Institute, speculated that the case may also involve fraud and corruption, which obviously requires strict investigation. &quot;This incident also shows that in some years of radical real estate development, some land transfers did not follow the regulations and were transferred illegally, which caused many problems and infringed on the legitimate rights and interests of the people.&quot; He further pointed out that the industry needs to monitor industrial land Pay more attention to safety issues, and companies should be cautious about some sites with a history of industrial land development to prevent sequelae. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On November 9, Lujiazui’s intraday price was 8.94 yuan per share, down 3.32%&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 15:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[作家做的事丨昼夜有时]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260204]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/08/OPZQPfGmKpkzdhhdwOeMj0xHzukNVQQo1yrwdngS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;1303&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/OPZQPfGmKpkzdhhdwOeMj0xHzukNVQQ o1yrwdngS. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257539&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Mother&#39;s magic shoes. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Earlier, I was talking about that before she got sick, she wore the Leviathan sold by Azhen Pei magic shoes. In fact, she was already feeling uncomfortable at that time. She was lethargic, had diarrhea and had a fever. Maybe cancer cells were growing wildly in her body, but no one knew it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She said they were a pair of magical shoes. A pair sells for MYR 2,200. Azhen allowed her to take the shoes home first and try them on for a while before paying. She was satisfied, and perhaps felt she had taken advantage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So she wore them out, to breakfast in town, to the store, and to her son&#39;s wedding in Taiwan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I almost fell!&quot; she once said to me. I don’t know whether it was because she was too weak at the time, or whether the shoes made her feet uncomfortable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I never cared about those shoes. It was a place where people would believe in porcupine dates, talisman water and head-dropping magic. A pair of shoes is no big deal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But those are no ordinary shoes. Azhen said that they were energy health shoes with super magnets. The soles of the shoes contained carefully blended Chinese medicine, which could open the second heart of the human body and stimulate the body&#39;s self-healing energy ring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Health comes from wearing it&quot;, it says on the paper bag of the shoes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the time I saw those shoes, she was already a skinny, spiteful patient. She began to resent the shoes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Paradoxically, her friend Xiuli also suffers from cancer. But Xiuli didn&#39;t wear magic shoes. She ate the collagen powder sold by Azhen. They both eat it every day. That thing is quite troublesome, you have to eat it as soon as you get up, and the sooner you eat it, the better. Once, when we were traveling to Xi&#39;an, she got up before dawn to boil water and make collagen powder. After drinking it, she went back to bed to sleep. The buzzing sound from the hotel kettle made my second sister and I upset. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She didn’t want to see the pair of shoes, so she asked my sister and I to go to Azhen’s barber shop to return the shoes. She went to get a haircut that day, but she didn&#39;t go to Azhen&#39;s barber shop, nor to Alian&#39;s barber shop downstairs. She held an umbrella alone and walked to the barber shop upstairs in the back shop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My sister and I bravely walked into Azhen’s barber shop. Azhen was perming a woman&#39;s hair while talking to us. She showed us her and her daughter&#39;s shoes. They all wore black leather shoes that were exactly the same as their mother’s pair of Allipex magic shoes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Look, my daughter and I wear them. I stand and work all day long, and my feet are not sore at all!&quot; Azhen said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course the shoes cannot be returned. &quot;Who would buy it after they&#39;ve already been worn?&quot; Azhen rejected us. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few days later, Xia Mu came to Ula Port, and his mother showed him the shoes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I tell you how these shoes are deceiving, you write it down and publish it in your newspaper.&quot; She said to Xia Mu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Natsuki and I looked at each other, then took a look at the dull, ugly shoes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is what she thinks writers and journalists should do. She can’t seem to tell the difference between a reporter and a writer. In her opinion, they are all scholars and writers, and they should use their pens to speak out for others and plead for the people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I tell you, you write it down.&quot; That&#39;s what she said when she told me about her experience of nearly losing her life giving birth to her son. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She herself is such a person, keen on upholding justice and speaking for others, which is completely opposite to her husband. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a period of time, in addition to working in the tailor shop, she was also busy applying for relief funds for the poor people passing through Hong Kong. She took a stack of application forms from the city council and distributed them to those who were struggling. When she met people who didn&#39;t know Malay, she asked her Malay friends to help fill out the forms because she didn&#39;t know much Malay herself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She also called the newspaper office and applied for the newspaper office’s relief fund for her friend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When she told me this, I was amazed at her ability and passion. I remembered something she said a long time ago. She said a fortune teller had predicted that if she continued to go to school, she would become a big shot like Li Jinshi. Li Jinshi was our former Minister of Health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She is very proud. She walked around Port Ula like a country squire, like a big shot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Soon her glory disappeared. She resented the magic shoes, resented her sister, and resented the person who deceived her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The night before the first chemotherapy session, in a hotel near the hospital, in the early hours of the morning, after vomiting out all her dinner, she told me a story about a woman. The woman received relief funds through her help, but she discovered that she was not poor. She and her husband ran a seafood business in a town not far from the port of Ula. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I still have their business cards.&quot; She said. She decided to call the newspaper to expose the woman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In less than a month, she herself became a person waiting for relief. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My father said that she could apply for relief and that she should receive relief. So the city council came. The man was also my mother’s friend, and he had been handling the application forms submitted on my mother’s behalf. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Azmin looked at his mother with deep understanding and compassion. He made an immediate decision and suggested that I take a photo of my mother. The mother had to lie in bed so that her illness could be fully revealed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I did not take pictures of my mother. Xia Mu also did not write a report for her to expose the scam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was much later, five years after her death, that I thought I should search the Internet for introductions or news about magic shoes. I soon saw the report in Southern Metropolis Daily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That was a report in 2016. She wasn&#39;t sick yet. I was still teaching in school at that time. Two years later, I was no longer a teacher and she was a dying patient. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When she showed us those shoes, why didn’t we think of searching online? Isn’t this the instinct and ability of us scholars? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Maybe I don’t care how much she spent on a pair of shoes. Maybe I was already used to the fact that she was being fooled. It was a place where people believed in porcupine dates, talisman water and head-dropping magic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I respect other people’s beliefs and lives, I always say this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have left Ula Port for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;We don&#39;t need relief.&quot; We kids all thought so. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I did not take pictures of my mother. Besides, my mother was unwilling to lie on the bed and let someone take a photo of her shame and despair. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After her death, one Sunday afternoon, the second sister returned the pair of magic shoes to Azhen. She used the silk money she received from the funeral to pay Ah Zhen 2,200 ringgit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After she died, I found a newspaper clipping in her drawer. That was the news about the &quot;Love in the World&quot; child sponsorship program in Sin Chew Daily on November 29, 2014. There are portraits of five sixth-grade students on the newspaper clipping. The title of the report is &quot;Repaying Sponsors with Good Results, Sin Chew Sponsored Students Achieve Excellent UPSR Results&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I thought they were all children passing through Hong Kong, children she had helped. no. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I know why she keeps that clipping. She loved stories like this, stories about struggle, hardship and reward, and gratitude. In the past, her children also received support from society with their excellent academic performance. She was proud of it, and she did not blush at all because of the deep aura of humility hidden in it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That pair of magic shoes may be on a woman&#39;s feet right now. We no longer talk about those past events. But I never forgot them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, I didn’t do what a daughter could (should?) do, so now I do what a writer should do. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[财政部通报460亿隐性债务案例，点名西安成都等地国企垫资]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260144]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On November 6, the Ministry of Finance issued the &quot;Notice on Typical Cases of Local Government Hidden Debt Accountability&quot;, It notified 8 typical cases of hidden debt accountability investigated and dealt with since 2022, involving nearly 46 billion yuan in new hidden debt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/86029ec6163e4aec5463b534412f9687.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;2254&quot; height=&quot;1222&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/86029ec6163e4aec5463b534412f9687.png&quot; data-key=&quot;257304&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;The targets of this notification involve some local governments, bank branches and state-owned enterprises, including: some areas in Hubei Province require provincial state-owned enterprises to advance capital for construction of new hidden debts, Liuzhou City in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region requires state-owned enterprises Projects with advanced financing for construction should be arranged by the fiscal budget.

The witchcraft disaster occurred in the second year of Zhenghe (91 BC). ——Witchcraft was a popular method at that time to use witchcraft to curse others. A common method was to pierce small wooden figures and bury them in the ground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sima Qian stated that the time when this incident occurred was not within the coverage of &quot;Historical Records&quot;. Even Ban Gu, who lived more than a hundred years later, probably because he was too sensitive, deliberately did not speak too clearly. In the biographies of the characters involved, the &quot;Hanshu&quot; talks so much that you can only read it after putting it together. Give a rough idea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There was a man named Jiang Chong who frantically framed the prince for using witchcraft to curse Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. The prince had no choice but to rebel. Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty asked Prime Minister Liu Quyou to command the army and fight the prince in Chang&#39;an City, and tens of thousands of people died. The prince was defeated and fled, eventually dying outside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sima Qian had two good friends involved in this matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One is Ren An, who was the &quot;envoy of the Northern Army&quot; at the time and controlled the largest army in Chang&#39;an City. When the prince rebelled, he sent a military talisman in an attempt to transfer troops to Ren An, but Ren An stayed behind closed doors after receiving the military talisman. This matter was considered by Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty to be &quot;double-minded&quot;, so Ren An was beheaded by Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One is Tian Ren, who is the Secretary of the Prime Minister&#39;s Office (an official under the Prime Minister&#39;s Office, responsible for supervising lawlessness, with a rank of two thousand stones, and is a senior official). At that time, he was assigned to guard the easternmost Fu&#39;an in the south of Chang&#39;an City. Door. The prince fled to this door, and he allowed the prince to escape. This crime is of course more serious and is also cut in half. Even the person who initially interceded for Tian Ren was so frightened that he committed suicide when Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty scolded him. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Sima Guang’s version: A traitor drives a wedge between father and son&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Sima Qian was working as a secretary to Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty at that time, but he could only watch his friend being executed and did not dare to Say more words. In fact, there are also some very fragmentary records of witchcraft cases in &quot;Historical Records&quot;, which basically do not talk about the incident itself, but mainly focus on the ending of the people involved. There are always different opinions on whether these contents were written by Sima Qian or added by later generations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Song Dynasty more than a thousand years later, when Sima Guang wrote &quot;Zi Zhi Tong Jian&quot;, based on Ban Gu&#39;s outline, he finally provided us with a complete and logical account of the witchcraft incident. A narrative that is rigorous, coherent, with strong conflicts and rich in details. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This story tells the story of the conflict between a talented but cruel father and a less talented but kind-hearted prince. Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty hoped to finish all the most difficult things during his lifetime, leaving a country in need of rest and recuperation for his son to govern. This just happens to be the perfect combination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, those who specifically helped Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty carry out brutal tasks knew that they would be doomed once the prince ascended the throne. So they tried every possible means to sabotage this plan. The most vicious one among them was Jiang Chong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty hoped to reach an understanding with his son again and again, but treacherous ministers and villains pushed the prince to a dead end while sending the wrong message to Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. Finally a catastrophe occurred. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After knowing the truth, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty punished the treacherous minister and expressed his longing for the prince in his womb. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a very sad, touching and educational story. Imagine that with Ban Gu&#39;s character, if you could read this story a thousand years later, you would probably express your appreciation instead of criticizing him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, many books and TV programs introducing Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty are based on the story of Sima Guang. Some people even extend it further, such as adding Sima Qian into this story. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then, this version of a traitor driving a wedge between father and son is cute, but I’m afraid it’s not believable. In the following, we use historical data as a basis, combined with our understanding of the operation of power and human nature, to peel off the cocoons and present the truth of the witchcraft disaster as much as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Liu Kun: Between Liu Zheng and Liu Fuling&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Let’s start with the son of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. In order to introduce the six sons of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, Ban Gu wrote &quot;Biography of the Five Sons of Wu&quot; and Sima Qian wrote &quot;The Family of Three Kings&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Biography of the Five Sons of Wu&quot; writes about the five sons of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, which is natural. Because there is another son, Emperor Zhao of Han, who inherited the throne, naturally he should not be placed with others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Family of Three Kings&quot; only writes about three sons, which is a bit strange; and the content of this article is also very abnormal. It only copies the relevant documents when the three princes were canonized as princes and kings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course there is a lot of debate as to why this is the case. But the title &quot;Family of Three Kings&quot; was decided by Sima Qian himself, there is no doubt about it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The three people mentioned in this article are: the second son of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, King Qi Liu Hong, the third son King Yan Liu Dan, and the fourth son King Guangling Liu Xu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The three people not mentioned are: the eldest son Liu Zhi, the crown prince of Wei, the fifth son Liu Kun, the king of Changyi, and the youngest son Liu Fuling, who later became Emperor Zhao of Han Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A simple explanation is that the first three were crowned kings on the same day in the sixth year of Yuanshou (117 BC), and no other people were involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But you can also make more complicated guesses: Ban Gu was from the Eastern Han Dynasty, so he naturally knew who succeeded him as emperor; Sima Qian was a person involved in the era of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. When he wrote &quot;The Family of Three Kings&quot;, he did not write All three of them have the possibility of inheriting the throne, and it is not appropriate to include them in the family. Even if the three people are included, it is inconvenient to say a lot of things. The only way to be safe is to copy official documents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of many people, only Liu Zhi and Liu Fuling are important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The eldest son Liu Ju was born in the first year of Yuanshuo (128 BC) and was regarded as the natural heir to the throne for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The youngest son Liu Fuling was born in the third year of Taishi (94 BC), and finally won the victory in the competition for the throne. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The age of Liu Kun, the king of Changyi, was roughly twenty years younger than Liu Ju and more than ten years older than Liu Fuling. The information about him is almost blank even in the &quot;Book of Han&quot;. Because of this large blank, some people think that Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty never paid attention to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the blank space may also be due to sensitivity. After all, Liu Kun&#39;s mother was Mrs. Li, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty&#39;s favorite woman, and Liu Kun&#39;s uncle was Li Guangli, who was madly throwing resources and opportunities at him. In addition, the time of Liu Kuang&#39;s death is also very sensitive. Different places in the &quot;Book of Han&quot; have slightly different accounts. Anyway, it was either before Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty died, or when Emperor Zhao of the Han Dynasty just ascended the throne. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“The beauty hidden in the golden house” is actually a political marriage&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is easy to put aside the folk gossip such as “the beauty hidden in the golden house” and only rely on &quot;Historical Records&quot; and &quot;Hanshu&quot; as the basis. We can conclude that Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty and his first queen, Chen, were completely political marriages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Empress Chen&#39;s mother, Princess Guantao, was the sister of Emperor Jing of the Han Dynasty and the daughter of Empress Dowager Dou. She had huge political influence. It can be said that among the sons of Emperor Jing of the Han Dynasty, whoever married the daughter of Princess Guantao received important bonus points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The mother of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty cleverly seized the opportunity and facilitated this marriage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early days of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty taking the throne, the power was in the hands of his grandmother, the Queen Mother Dou. Because of a reckless political reform, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty was almost deposed. His ability to keep the throne was also related to the eldest princess. Because the old lady&#39;s favorite was this daughter (so she later &quot;leaves all the money and property of the Edom Palace to the eldest princess for prostitution&quot;), she does not need to care about this grandson (there are a lot of them anyway), but she cannot harm her daughter&#39;s son-in-law too much (if the daughter, If the granddaughter is very satisfied with him). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So later Princess Guantao could simply say: &quot;The emperor cannot be established except for me.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, for a period of time, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty could be said to be under Empress Chen under the protection of. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Qian Gang&#39;s dictatorship, for a talented and arrogant emperor like Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, I am afraid that when he thinks of this past event, he is not grateful, but humiliated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Empress Chen simply did not understand the emperor&#39;s psychology and did not take care of his emotions. &quot;Historical Records&quot; said that she was &quot;arrogant&quot;, and &quot;Hanshu&quot; said that she was &quot;good at pampering and arrogant&quot;. This pampering probably does not mean doting, but means high status. Because the character of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty is obviously that if you are arrogant because of my favor, it doesn&#39;t matter; if you are arrogant because of your status, it will be very serious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So it is only a matter of time before the queen is deposed. In the case of deposing the queen, cruel officials like Zhang Tang must be sentenced severely and try their best to implicate the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Historical Records&quot;, the queen of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty was introduced as Wei Zifu at the beginning, and then used a narrative technique to tell everyone that Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty also had an empress Chen. This reflects the era of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. atmosphere. The &quot;Book of Han&quot; honestly follows the chronological order, and Empress Xiaowu Chen and Empress Xiaowuwei wrote it this way. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Prince Liu Zhi survived the first round of challenges&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to &quot;Historical Records&quot;, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty seemed to only be so fond of his second queen, Wei Zifu. I suddenly saw her in a specific environment, liked her very much, and then brought her into the palace. Then I actually forgot about her for more than a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Wei Zifu was undoubtedly the lucky star of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. She brought Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty three daughters and one son, but more importantly, she also brought two dazzling famous generals, Wei Qing and Huo Qubing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning, Wei Qing got the opportunity to lead troops in the war because he was the younger brother of Queen Wei Zifu; but within a few years, it probably became that because he was the sister of General Wei Qing, Wei Qing Zihu&#39;s status as queen was not shaken. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wei Qing has great martial arts skills and is irreplaceable; Wei Qing is also gentle and low-key, and is good at getting along well with all parties. In the sixth year of Yuanshuo (123 BC), Wei Qing took advantage of the remaining power of his two major victories over the Huns and humbly took out half of the reward given to him by the emperor to celebrate the birthday of the parents of Mrs. Wang, who was favored by Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. Obviously, Mrs. Wang has posed a strong challenge to Wei Zifu&#39;s status. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the years when Mrs. Wang was favored, Sima Qian was working as a Langguan in the palace. Later, Mrs. Wang passed away, and a young alchemist from Qi called upon Mrs. Wang&#39;s spirit for Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. Sima Qian also observed it at close range. He was obviously particularly impressed by how much Mrs. Wang was loved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mrs. Wang was also born at the wrong time. Her status in the heart of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty may have surpassed that of Wei Zifu, but she was favored at the time when Wei Qing and Huo Qubing were indispensable to Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. era. In the sixth year of Yuanshou (117 BC), before his death, Huo Qubing asked Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty to make three princes besides the prince king, and Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty agreed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sima Qian was known for his &quot;curiosity&quot;, but when it came to writing about the harem of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, he was quite strict. Therefore, some details have to be filled in by others: Mrs. Wang was ill at that time, and Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty asked her, where do you want me to seal your son? Mrs. Wang said about Luoyang, and Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty said that Luoyang was really not good, &quot;There is no country in Guandong that is larger than Qi. Qidong faces the sea and has a large city. In ancient times, it was alone in Ganzhong with 100,000 households. There is no country in the world that is richer than Qi.&quot; , let your son be the king of Qi. After Mrs. Wang passed away, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty specially gave her the status of Queen Mother of King Qi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If Chu Shaosunbu’s story is to be believed, if Mrs. Wang proposed to grant Luoyang to her son, then if her consciousness was not too low, then it was clearly out of anger; Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty seemed to feel a little guilty towards Mrs. Wang. , maybe he promised her something but failed to fulfill it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In any case, Wei Zifu and Prince Liu Zhi survived the first round of challenges. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The &quot;beautiful city and country&quot; Mrs. Li&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The next few years when Mrs. Li was most favored were roughly the Yuanfeng period (110 BC to 105 BC). During this period, Sima Qian After ending his career as a Langguan, he went to serve as Taishi Ling, and he distanced himself a little from the affairs in the palace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The extent of Mrs. Li&#39;s favor cannot be seen from &quot;Historical Records&quot;. But when Ban Gu wrote about Mrs. Li, his heart was about to burst with gossip:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, Ban Gu said that the first person whom Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty appreciated was Mrs. Li’s brother Li Yannian. Li Yannian sang such a song: &quot;There is a beautiful woman in the north, peerless and independent. She looks at the Qingren city and then the Qingren country. It is better not to know the Qingcheng and the Qingguo. It is hard to find a beautiful woman again!&quot; Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty sighed after hearing this and said Is there really such a beautiful person in the world? So Princess Pingyang, the sister of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty (wei Zifu was also recommended by her, which was considered her profession) recommended Mrs. Li to Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. From then on, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty loved him very much. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, Ban Gu said that Mrs. Li was seriously ill and Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty came to see her. Mrs. Li covered herself in the quilt and said that I had been seriously ill for a long time and was &quot;disfigured&quot; and could not see the emperor. My wish was that the emperor could take good care of my son and brothers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty wanted to see Mrs. Li&#39;s face very much, but Mrs. Li refused. In the end, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty left angrily. Mrs. Li&#39;s sisters blamed her, why did she make the emperor so angry? Mrs. Li said, I don&#39;t let the emperor see me as I am now, it is for the sake of my brother. &quot;A husband who treats others with sex will lose his lust and love to relax. If he loves to relax, he will not be kind.&quot; If he can&#39;t see me now, the emperor You will always remember my most beautiful appearance; when you see me now, you will only dislike me from now on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This classic case is often cited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirdly, the story about the young man summoning Mrs. Wang’s soul was taken by Ban Gu and placed in Mrs. Li’s body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fourthly, Ban Gu said that after seeing Mrs. Li&#39;s soul, &quot;he wrote a poem of his own to mourn Mrs. Li.&quot; This is a very long piece with many difficult words to understand, so I won’t copy it here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone can make up gossip stories. Writing love poems for emperors is also a hobby of many literati. Therefore, the above four points recorded by Ban Gu are all true or false. Very adventurous. But again, there are so many jokes about Mrs. Li, which shows that in people&#39;s minds, Mrs. Li was the most important woman in the eyes of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, if there is any doubt about the authenticity of the above things, then the following two things will never be ignored by a historian of Ban Gu’s level: First, after Mrs. Li’s death, “after the She was buried with the ceremony of a queen; secondly, after Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty passed away, Huo Guang knew the emperor&#39;s thoughts and &quot;used Mrs. Li as food, and she was given the honorary title of Queen Xiaowu.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mrs. Li is treated as a queen, so what should her son be? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also, the song &quot;Total Country and City&quot; sounds like a prophecy no matter how you listen to it. As we all know, Chinese history books have a characteristic. Prophecies may be made up, but once the prophecy is written down, it will come true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So what kind of disastrous consequences did Mrs. Li cause to deserve such a prophecy that she would conquer the country and conquer the city? Of course, there is only the scourge of witchcraft. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The decline of Wei&#39;s relatives&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In fact, in the &quot;Book of Han&quot;, Ban Gu left many other clues, and these records happened to be able to compare with Sima Qian&#39;s previous history. Narrative, perfectly connected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let us return to the vulgar palace fight plot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with Mrs. Wang, Mrs. Li has the greatest luck: it is not that Wei Zifu has become older and more beautiful, but that the two obstacles of Wei Qing and Huo Qubing no longer exist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huo Qubing died in the sixth year of Yuanshou (117 BC). Although Wei Qing lived until the fifth year of Yuanfeng (106 BC), he never led an army. Because during the Yuanding and Yuanfeng years, the opponents faced by Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty were no longer the Xiongnu at their peak. For enemies like South Vietnam, East Vietnam, and North Korea, other generals are enough to control the situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But this does not mean that the obstacles have been completely removed. The generals who are now active are also closely related to Wei Qing and Huo Qubing. Wei Qing brought out a dozen generals, and Huo Qubing trained two. General Han Henghai, who played an important role in destroying East Vietnam, said that General Xun Shen, who destroyed North Korea, as well as Gongsun He, Gongsun Ao and others, were all under Wei Qing&#39;s command at that time. Lu Bode, the general who destroyed South Vietnam, and Zhao Ponu, who captured King Loulan alive, came from the Huo Qubing system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that the so-called Wei Qing does not support scholar-bureaucrats, mainly refers to the fact that he does not support famous speakers, activists, and knights in Chang&#39;an City. After fighting for so many years and making decisive decisions in the army, of course he still You have to train your own team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is also worth noting that the Li Guang family. Although Li Guang’s death is believed to be related to Wei Qing, and Li Guang’s son Li Gan is even believed to have died at the hands of Huo Qubing, the Li and Wei families quickly Relationships repaired. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Guang&#39;s cousin Li Cai got the title of marquis because he fought with Wei Qing; even Li Gan himself was able to &quot;confer the title of Marquis of Guannei&quot; under Huo Qubing. Then Li Gan&#39;s daughter became the favored woman of Prince Wei, and Li Gan&#39;s son Li Yu was also the favored subordinate of Prince Wei. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Are these people a political group? When Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty was around, and the status of the prince remained unshakable, it would not count, because the relationship between them was also complicated and full of contradictions; but if Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty changed the prince, they would be: because the new prince would have a new team, they would have to make room for them. seat. Just like back then, the conflict between Xiao He and Cao Shen was once great, but once Liu Bang wanted to abolish Emperor Hui of Han and replace Emperor Hui of Zhao with Liu Ruyi, they were old brothers in the same trench again. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Li family’s relatives did not live up to expectations&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The following is a guess I made based on the above historical data:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yuan Feng (110 BC ~ 105 BC) In a certain year of , Mrs. Li passed away. From then on, she became the most beautiful image in the heart of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty believed that Mrs. Li was the queen, so he wanted to change Liu Kun, the king of Changyi, to the crown prince. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty was about fifty years old at this time. His energy may not be as good as before, but he was undoubtedly more foresighted and sophisticated. He would not rush to express his position on such an important matter, and would not even reveal much of his thoughts. That would directly lead to the failure of the original military and political system, which is not worth it anyway. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first year of Taichu (104 BC), Li Guangli was appointed as the general of the Second Division and commanded a war that lasted four years and overloaded the whole country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, the war was going to be fought, but Li Guangli was in charge of it. To say that &quot;the noble prince favors his concubine Li&quot; is an understatement. I just want Li Guangli to be made a marquis, and let him cooperate with a general like Zhao Ponu to fight an easy war like the Loulan Conquest. The reason for making him a marquis is enough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in Li Guangli&#39;s headquarters, although the origins of Zhao Shicheng, Li Duo, and Shangguan Jie are not very clear, there are no veteran generals under Wei Qing and Huo Qubing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty wanted to cultivate a new military merit group led by Li Guangli and unrelated to Wei Qing and Huo Qubing. In this way, even if the prince changes in the future, it will not cause too much shock. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Li Guangli was too unsatisfactory. The conquest of Dayuan was a tragic victory that outweighed the gains, and the defeat of the Huns was a disastrous defeat again and again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, today&#39;s researchers may think that Li Guangli&#39;s ability is not that bad. The experience of later generations shows that the limit of the Central Plains dynasty&#39;s power to advance westward was the eastern foot of the Pamir Plateau. Li Guangli&#39;s conquest of Dayuan exceeded this limit. When fighting against the Xiongnu, the situation at this time was completely different from that during the Wei Qing and Huo Qubing era. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this era, the strategic advantages of the Han Dynasty were incomprehensible to the Huns, so no matter how they won the war, the Huns still sought peace talks with the Han Dynasty; It is almost impossible to explain: after the conquest of Dayuan, the problem of the Han Dynasty&#39;s shortage of horses was not alleviated but greatly intensified. The Huns&#39; mobility advantage became greater, so facing the Han army on the expedition, they only needed to avoid , snooping, tracking... Wait until you have to retreat, are close to home and are most exhausted, then suddenly launch a fatal blow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So the wisest choice for the Han Dynasty was to defend and just watch the Central Plains get better day by day and the Xiongnu get worse day by day. But as long as the expedition is far away, replacing other generals will have no good results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But not everyone will accept these views today, and people in the Han Dynasty would not think so. It is better to compare Li Guangli with Wei Qing and Huo Qubing. It is more in line with human nature to heal the past and harm the present. Even those who looked down on Wei and Huo back then, their current mentality is &quot;There is no need to go back to Wen Jingshi, looking back at Huolin is already a loss&quot;, right? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty was also gradually losing patience. It is a miracle that the emperor&#39;s love for a woman can last for so long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the spring of the fourth year of the Han Dynasty (97 BC), Li Guangli once again conquered the Huns but failed. In the summer, Liu Kun was named the king of Changyi. Although it cannot be said that this is a determined fate, it is not a good sign after all. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Liu Fuling was born and &quot;Yao&#39;s mother gate&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the third year of Taishi (94 BC), Gou Yi and Zhao Jieyu gave birth to the sixty-three-year-old Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. A little prince Liu Fuling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Talking about the story of Lady Gouyi Zhao Jieyu, Ban Gu started to indulge in gossip again: When Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty was patrolling through Hejian County, it was not the officials but the &quot;spiritual seekers&quot; who discovered this strange thing. woman. Her hands were naturally clenched into fists and could not be opened. Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty went up and touched them. Wow, the palms of the beautiful girl were open. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are all clearly written by Ban Gu in the &quot;Book of Han·Biography of Wife&#39;s Relatives&quot;, and are almost exactly the same as the relevant content in &quot;The Story of Hanwu&quot;. &quot;The Story of Hanwu&quot; is pretended to be a work by Ban Gu, which is certainly not credible, but it is also unrealistic to think that Ban Gu wrote rigorous and precise history, while the other works are absurd novels. They are completely opposite. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then, it is said that Zhao Jieyu was pregnant with Liu Fuling for fourteen months. Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty said that he heard that Yao also stayed in his mother&#39;s belly for fourteen months before being born. So the palace gate where Zhao Jieyu lived was named &quot;Yaomu Gate&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yao was a holy king in ancient times. He governed the world so well. Nowadays, another Yao is born in the world. Don’t you think it’s a pity that he is not allowed to become emperor? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this place, Sima Qian was actually quite cooperative with Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. There are many legends about Yao. The version accepted by &quot;Historical Records&quot; is that Yao was the youngest son of Emperor Ku, and he succeeded to the throne of emperor after squeezing out all his brothers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, although the cinnabar mole in Mrs. Li&#39;s heart has not turned into mosquito blood, it does have a ray of fresh white moonlight shining into the emperor&#39;s life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, it was not only Wei Zifu and the prince who were nervous at this time, but also Li Guangli, whose fate was firmly bound to his nephew. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking forward, the prince&#39;s back seems to be getting further and further away. Looking back, the contemporary Tang Yao is quickly approaching. If you don&#39;t want to be caught up by the person behind you, it&#39;s best to catch up with the person in front. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; How close are fellow Zhao people? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Mr. Fang Shiming is a senior scholar who is particularly good at discovering political groups based on people&#39;s place of origin. In traditional society, the relationship between people is particularly important except for blood ties. This method is of course not absolutely correct, but it does explain many problems. One of his papers teased out such a clue:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mrs. Li and Li Guangli&#39;s family are &quot;Zhongshan old advocates&quot;. Zhongshan is surrounded by Zhao. &quot;Historical Records·Huo Shi Biography&quot; introduces the customs of the world, which is also I put Zhao and Zhongshan together. Therefore, people from Zhongshan and Zhao are both from their hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then let’s look at the characters who played an important role in forcing the prince to death in the witchcraft disaster:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first is Prime Minister Liu Quya, who is the brother of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty The son of Liu Sheng, Prince Jing of Zhongshan - there are so many &quot;after Liu Sheng, Prince Jing of Zhongshan&quot; in the history books. It is rare that this one is true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is actually not easy for the sons of princes and kings to become high officials in the court. The &quot;Book of Han&quot; says that &quot;I don&#39;t know where it started&quot;, but it also tells us that Liu Quya and Li Guangli were not only fellow Zhongshan fellows, but also their sons and daughters. (&quot;The Biography of Liu Quya&quot;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There were Hu cavalry stationed in Chang&#39;an City. When Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty and his son went to war, whoever could get the support of this army would win a key bargaining chip. The person who helped Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty kill the prince&#39;s envoy and take over the command of this army was called Ma Tong, who was the great-grandfather of Ma Yuan, General Fubo of the Eastern Han Dynasty. He had just moved to Maoling from Handan of Zhao State not long ago. living. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And on the battlefield against the Huns, Ma Tong and Li Guangli fought together and had a close relationship. (&quot;Book of Han·Biography of the Xiongnu&quot;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Tong&#39;s elder brother Ma Heluo was a good friend of Jiang Chong. (&quot;Book of Han·Jin Rixiu Biography&quot;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, Jiang Chong bit the prince the hardest and was at the forefront. He was also from Handan, and the characteristics of their family were similar to those of the Zhongshan Li family. Likewise, he is also good at singing and dancing. As we all know, the entertainment industry has its own unique network of relationships. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Anyway, what is certain is that in the second year of Zhenghe (91 BC), the prince was forced to death. In the third year of Zhenghe (90 BC), Li Guangli led an army to attack the Huns. When they reached Weiqiao, Li Guangli Liu Quyou said to see him off: &quot;I hope that the king will ask the king of Changyi to be the crown prince. If he is established as the emperor, why should the king worry?&quot; They were the beneficiaries of this disaster. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in this year, someone reported to Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty that Liu Qumo&#39;s wife was practicing witchcraft and cursing the emperor. Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty sent relevant departments to investigate and interrogate, and believed that &quot;the crime was a serious crime&quot;, so Liu Quyou&#39;s entire family was wiped out. Li Guangli, who was fighting against the Huns at the front, heard the news and knew that returning to the Han Dynasty was also a capital offense, so he surrendered to the Huns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This matter sounds like Liu Quya’s wife is out of her mind. But the fact may be that Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty knew that the prince was framed by them. But there is no problem in blaming Jiang Chong for framing the prince, but blaming it on the prime minister and the general of the second division. A series of intrigues inside the palace will be exposed, and countless rumors will be spawned, so we find another reason to deal with them. Anyway, at this time, the crime of witchcraft is , just like talking about corruption today, it is basically a sure shot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not conjecture. In fact, Ban Gu wrote about it again. In the first year of Houyuan (88 BC), Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty was about to collapse, and he inadvertently told the truth:&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;The report said: &quot;I have been immoral. Since the Prime Minister Zuo (Liu Quyou) and the Second Master (Li Guangli) conspired to rebel, the disaster of witchcraft has spread to the scholar-bureaucrats...&quot; (&quot;Han Shu·Che Qianqiu Biography&quot;)&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;If the &quot;conspiracy to rebel&quot; refers to Liu Quyou&#39;s practice of witchcraft, then the matter did not &quot;reach the scholar-bureaucrats&quot;. It is only reasonable to understand that it means they framed the prince. Yan Shigu also understood it this way when he commented on the &quot;Book of Han&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It seems that the mastermind of this catastrophe in which the prince and queen were killed, tens of thousands of people were buried with them (original text of &quot;Han Shu&quot;: &quot;tens of thousands of zombies&quot;), and the capital was bloodied was actually Mrs. Li. Brother Li Guangli. According to the logic of &quot;beauties bring disaster,&quot; of course it is true that Mrs. Li &quot;overwhelms the country and the city&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;What kind of person is Prince Wei?&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;What is easier to judge is that the image of Prince Wei in &quot;Hanshu&quot; is indeed different from that in &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Zi Zhi Tong Jian&quot; says that the prince is &quot;benevolent, gentle and cautious&quot;, &quot;honest and quiet&quot;, this image does not exist in the &quot;Han Shu&quot;; &quot;all the ministers are generous and generous&quot; The situation of &quot;Prince&quot; is completely inconsistent with the description in &quot;Hanshu&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most important introduction to Prince Wei in the &quot;Book of Han&quot; is this sentence:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The purpose of establishing Bowang Garden is to allow guests to communicate with each other and follow their preferences, so Most people enter with heresy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A large number of restless people gathered around the prince. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So in fact, the prince&#39;s team action ability is quite strong. If he felt that he was going to be framed by the envoys of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, he could react immediately, arresting those who could be caught and killing those who deserved to be killed, without any ambiguity at all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then organizing the armed forces was quite efficient: the prince seized the arsenal of Chang&#39;an City and armed his guests; mobilized the power of Changle Palace where Queen Wei Zifu lived; and then released the prisoners of Chang&#39;an City and awarded them arms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, those who almost succeeded in mobilizing include: 1. Changshui Cavalry stationed in the southeast of Chang&#39;an and Xuanqu Cavalry stationed in the southwest of Chang&#39;an; 2. Ren&#39;an&#39;s Northern Army. According to the description in the &quot;Book of Han&quot;, the battle between Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty and Prince Wei for these two teams was a matter of a split second: Ma Tong arrived a little late, and the prince&#39;s subordinates were like Hou (this person&#39;s identity was actually a Prisoners) can mobilize the Hu cavalry; Ren An has served as the prince&#39;s young master, and if he is a little more loyal to the prince, he will not stay out of the matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Had we not made plans for a rebellion long ago, conducted an in-depth and comprehensive investigation and analysis of the military forces available to Chang&#39;an City, and had detailed and well-planned deployments, it would be difficult to imagine such an action. efficiency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even after losing these two powerful armies, the prince&#39;s army still formed a strong combat effectiveness. Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty&#39;s army to counter the rebellion should be composed of elite doctors and guards, equipped with the most sophisticated crossbows of the Han Dynasty that even frightened the Xiongnu (so Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty emphasized not to engage in close combat), plus three The local troops of the auxiliary army fought like this for five days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, his quick reactions, quick actions, and powerful combat show that Prince Wei is not a character who is easily bullied. Compared with Liu An, the king of Huainan who was said to want to rebel but was helpless, Liu An really should have invented a piece of tofu and killed himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ban Gu also made some interesting comments about the prince. When the prince was born, &quot;Chiyou&#39;s flag is as long as the sky.&quot; The so-called &quot;Chiyou&#39;s flag&quot; refers to the comet with a long tail in the sky. The ancients believed that this was a symbol of disaster in war. The Han Dynasty&#39;s war against the Xiongnu began, and the prince was born. After that, the war lasted for thirty years, and &quot;the soldiers slaughtered the barbarians and killed countless people.&quot; Then there was the great war and chaos in the capital. Therefore, &quot;The prince grew up with soldiers and ended with them.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Originally, reading this sentence just makes people think that Ban Gu is implying that the prince represents the flames of war and murderous intent. A sentence in the published &quot;Tsinghua Bamboo Slips·Five Chronicles&quot; suddenly made people realize: &quot;The Yellow Emperor had a son named Chiyou. When he grew up, he served as a soldier.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ban Gu was clearly saying, The prince is the incarnation of Chi You. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The few words about the prince in &quot;Historical Records&quot; do not indicate that Sima Qian had any closeness to the prince. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thinking vulgarly, when the prince and Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty were fighting in Chang&#39;an, Sima Qian would probably rather Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty win, even if it was to save his own life. At this time, he was Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty&#39;s Zhongshu Ling. To put it bluntly, he was a eunuch who helped the emperor handle administrative affairs. If the prince won, everyone around the emperor would be destroyed, and Sima Qian would probably not be able to escape. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sima Qian’s friends Ren An and Tian Ren are not princelings in the strict sense. Tian Ren can be considered loyal to the prince, but his position is as an official of the Prime Minister&#39;s Palace (to be understood according to the thinking of spy war dramas, it should be said that the prince is a powerful figure); Ren An is even more suspicious, and he has received the prince&#39;s military talisman. When sending troops, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty said that he was &quot;double-minded&quot;. In fact, he admitted that he was not a prince, and that he was also the leader of Xiongcai who had high demands on his ministers. According to ordinary people, if he did not move his troops at that time, he would still favor the emperor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other figures related to the prince:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sima Qian&#39;s impression of Wei Qing and Huo Qubing is known to be bad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shi De, the prince&#39;s teacher, is used by some scholars as an argument that &quot;the ministers who are generous and the elders all attach themselves to the prince&quot;. In fact, Sima Qian had some comments about Shi De: The ancestors of the Shi family were talented but not good at learning, but they were very cautious and cautious. After Shi De&#39;s father passed away, their family&#39;s &quot;filial piety and prudence gradually declined.&quot; This is not far from saying that Shi De is useless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is also Li Guang&#39;s grandson, &quot;Yu dared to be favored by the prince, but he was fond of profit, and Li&#39;s mausoleum has declined slowly.&quot; Li Yu, who was favored by the prince, was a vulgar money addict in the eyes of Sima Qian , and is the unworthy descendant of his beloved flying general Li Guang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The conflict between the prince and Emperor Wu of Han Dynasty broke out. To put it bluntly, it was just a struggle between two political forces. There was no &quot;battle between two lines&quot;, and there was no morality or ideal at all. But they have been forced to this point, and no one can retreat. What they are fighting for is not only the supreme imperial power, but also the humblest survival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this way, if Sima Qian did not write about the disaster of witchcraft, he might as well give a literary explanation: his heroic and heroic pen could not face this era. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The era of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty before Taichu in his works was, of course, full of violence and bloodstains, but there were also numerous heroes and heroes. Even the despicable and shameless characters he hated were still high-spirited and majestic. , this kind of afterglow shone into the Tianhan years, but by Taishi and Zhenghe, there was really only suffocating madness and calculation left. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The world has changed not because someone died, but because tonight&#39;s cold wind blew down the stars of last night, and the stars in the sky naturally and irrevocably dimmed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From this point of view, I would rather the story told by Sima Guang is true, and it seems to have a bit of idealism and family affection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[阿尔茨海默病年轻化来临？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260214]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Alzheimer&#39;s disease is often seen as a disease of the elderly, so young people suffer from Alzheimer&#39;s disease The disease will produce more interpretations. At the same time, new research has found that the simplest way to prevent the early onset or younger onset of Alzheimer&#39;s disease is to have a good night&#39;s sleep. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On January 31, 2023, Jia Jianping’s team at Xuanwu Hospital reported in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease that a patient developed memory impairment at the age of 17 and was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease at the age of 19. (AD) patients. This is the youngest patient to date. The patient suffered from memory loss, frequently lost personal belongings, could not remember whether he had eaten or not, and was ultimately unable to complete his studies and had to drop out of high school. Previously, patients younger than 30 years old have been reported, with the youngest age of onset being 21 years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the process of diagnosis and treatment of the patient, the research team found that the patient&#39;s main symptom was memory decline, especially episodic memory decline. Combined with the Wechsler Memory Scale and Auditory Word Learning Test assessment, the patient&#39;s main symptoms were memory decline, especially episodic memory decline. A diagnosis was made. However, the patient had no family history of hereditary disease and could not find other causes of memory impairment such as genetics, infections, and systemic diseases. After whole-genome sequencing, it was found that the patient did not carry any risk or pathogenic gene mutations, ruling out the possibility of familial Alzheimer&#39;s disease. Therefore, its pathogenesis requires further study. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Alzheimer’s disease is not exclusive to the elderly, but young people can also get it. Currently, there are at least 50 million dementia patients worldwide, and it is expected that the number will reach 152 million by 2050, of which about 60%-70% are Alzheimer&#39;s disease patients. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Research on Alzheimer&#39;s disease has long been classified. The disease has a youthful form, but this is not an independent disease. Alzheimer&#39;s disease is classified according to the age at onset. A standard and a title. Alzheimer&#39;s disease is divided into early-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease (also known as young-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease) and late-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease. Early-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease refers to Alzheimer&#39;s disease that occurs in adults between the ages of 18 and 64, and those younger than 35 are called very early-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Age statistics of Alzheimer&#39;s disease patients in various countries around the world show that the average age of onset of the disease is 51 years old. Young-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease accounts for 4%-6% of Alzheimer&#39;s disease. However, most cases of young-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease develop between the ages of 45 and 65. Statistics in the United States show that the mortality rate of young-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease among those aged 40-64 is 24.2%. Now, the 19-year-old patient diagnosed with Alzheimer&#39;s disease in China belongs to the ultra-early form. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Insight Report on the Needs of Alzheimer&#39;s Disease Patients&quot; released by the National Health Commission on September 20, 2023 pointed out that there are currently about 15.07 million dementia patients in China aged 60 and above, among which Alzheimer&#39;s patients There are 9.83 million patients with Alzheimer&#39;s disease, and it is expected that by 2050, the number of Alzheimer&#39;s patients will exceed 40 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the prevalence of Alzheimer&#39;s disease continues to rise in China, this disease, which mainly affects people over 60 years old, has shown a new characteristic in China. The incidence of Alzheimer&#39;s disease is increasing among young people in China. . Reported statistics show that the incidence of Alzheimer&#39;s disease is 2.5% for those under 40 years old; 4.1% for 40-49 year olds; 14.7% for 50-59 year olds; 28.9% for 60-69 year olds; and 70-79 year olds. 33.2%; 16.6% for those aged 80 and above. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that the high-risk group of the disease is 60-79 years old, accounting for 62.1%. Alzheimer&#39;s disease is said to have early onset when it occurs under the age of 60. In China, 21.3% of patients with Alzheimer&#39;s disease are under the age of 60. Compared with the international incidence rate of 5%-10% in this age group, China&#39;s early-onset incidence rate has increased significantly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether it is China or the United Nations standards, people under 50 years old are middle-aged and young people. China&#39;s &quot;Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of the Elderly&quot; collectively refers to citizens over 60 years old as the elderly. However, according to the classification of life by the United Nations and World Health Organization in 2020, there are 5 stages. Minors: 0 to 17 years old; young people: 18 to 65 years old; middle-aged people: 66 to 79 years old; elderly: 80 to 99 years old; longevity elderly: over 100 years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If according to the new standards of the United Nations, 18-65 years old are all young people, then half of the patients with Alzheimer&#39;s disease in China may be young people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many factors that contribute to the development of Alzheimer&#39;s disease, but taking one simple preventative approach can reduce the incidence and number of people affected by the disease. Some previous studies have found a link between napping and Alzheimer&#39;s disease. A long-term follow-up survey of the leisure activities and sleep conditions of more than 20,000 elderly people found that those who have the habit of napping have about a 37% lower risk of developing Alzheimer&#39;s disease than those who do not take naps. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this was only a study of older adults. A recent study on young and middle-aged people found that as long as they have good deep sleep, they can effectively prevent Alzheimer&#39;s disease, especially the younger generation of the disease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Framingham Heart Institute, the University of Texas and other centers in the United States have just published the results of a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association (&amp;nbsp;JAMA) showing that deep sleep helps To slow down brain aging, every 1% decrease in deep sleep per year is associated with a 27% increase in the risk of dementia, suggesting that maintaining deep sleep time can prevent Alzheimer&#39;s disease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this study, researchers used data from the Framingham Heart Study, a long-term, ongoing cardiovascular cohort study of residents of Framingham, Massachusetts. The study began in 1948 with 5,209 adults in Framingham and has continued for more than seventy years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the study, researchers analyzed 346 participants from the Framingham Heart Study cohort who were in their thirties when they originally entered the study (1995-1998). A standard young man. Study participants completed two nocturnal sleep studies measuring polysomnography (PSG) between 1995-1998 and 2001-2003, with an average interval of 5 years between studies. The researchers recorded the participants&#39; Alzheimer&#39;s disease status over the next 17 years and analyzed the relationship between deep sleep and Alzheimer&#39;s disease risk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Study participants&#39; average percentage of deep sleep at baseline was 18.1%, and participants&#39; deep sleep time decreased between the two nightly sleep studies, suggesting that deep sleep increases with age. reduce. During the 17 years of follow-up, 52 patients with Alzheimer&#39;s disease were diagnosed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After adjusting for other influencing factors, the researchers found that each 1% decrease in deep sleep per year was associated with a 27% increase in the risk of all-cause Alzheimer&#39;s disease and a 32% increase in the risk of Alzheimer&#39;s disease. % related. The study also found that in the presence of a genetic risk for Alzheimer&#39;s disease (APOE4 allele), the decrease in deep sleep accelerates with age, but changes in brain volume do not affect deep sleep time. This means that Alzheimer&#39;s disease can be effectively prevented if people maintain a normal amount of deep sleep. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason is that deep sleep is essential for the brain to remove metabolic waste, including the main proteins that accumulate in Alzheimer&#39;s disease, such as amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau protein. At the same time, as we age, there will be less and less deep sleep, which may lead to a continued weakening of lymphoid fluid clearance, increase the risk of Aβ and Tau protein formation, and lead to neurodegenerative diseases or Alzheimer&#39;s disease . At the same time, insufficient deep sleep is also associated with the development of vascular risk factors and may lead to dementia through the accumulation of cerebrovascular disease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although this study does not reveal the exact cause-and-effect relationship between insufficient deep sleep and Alzheimer&#39;s disease, maintaining deep sleep time is a simple way to prevent Alzheimer&#39;s disease, and it can be done at a young age. You should have and maintain good deep sleep when you are young, because the time of deep sleep is different for different ages. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deep sleep is also called golden sleep. It is the stage when people sleep the deepest and most soundly. At this time, they cannot hear any noise outside and it is difficult to be awakened by others. During deep sleep, the human body has a powerful body repair function, and the effect of relieving fatigue is also most obvious. For young people aged 20-30, deep sleep accounts for 20%-25% of their sleep time every night, while for elderly people aged 70-80, deep sleep accounts for only 5%-7% of their total sleep time every night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deep sleep is related to the duration of sleep, which is another manifestation of quantity and quality. When an average person sleeps less than 6 hours a night, deep sleep will be reduced. Moreover, if you want to have better and more time of deep sleep, you must first fall asleep before 23:00. 23:00 to 3:00 the next morning is the best time to enter deep sleep. Once you miss it, no matter how long you sleep afterwards, you will It&#39;s hard to make up for it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, even a very short nap, 1-3 pm is the optimal rest time, which can enhance the brain&#39;s memory processing ability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the information age, in order to reduce and prevent the early onset of Alzheimer&#39;s disease, it is best not to stay up late and maintain normal and better deep sleep. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[69个案例，多个政府部门被立案调查背后：反垄断的硬骨头]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260196]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Starting in March 2022, the State Administration for Market Regulation will launch a nationwide campaign to curb administrative abuses Powers, special actions to eliminate law enforcement that restricts competition.

(Photo provided by People’s Vision)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On April 7, 2023, the Urban Management Bureau of Dingnan County, Jiangxi Province was placed under investigation for reasons related to the operating rights of shared bicycles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the end of 2022, the Dingnan County Urban Management Bureau will conduct a public bidding for the shared electric bicycle operating rights project in the main urban area of ​​the county. In the end, two companies obtained the operating rights, and the Urban Management Bureau signed contracts with these two companies, limiting a total of 1,500 vehicles to be put into operation for a period of three years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After investigation by the Jiangxi Provincial Market Supervision and Administration Bureau, it is believed that the Dingnan County Urban Management Bureau limited the number of shared electric vehicles in the main urban area through public bidding without any legal and regulatory basis. Operating enterprises excludes or restricts other business entities with qualified qualifications and service capabilities from entering this market, hindering fair market competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Dingnan County Urban Management Bureau was found to have abused administrative power to exclude and restrict competition. This behavior is also called administrative monopoly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chen Bing, director of the Competition Law Research Center of Nankai University, explained that administrative monopoly is an administrative monopoly that directly or indirectly interferes with market competition to protect or support certain entities by abusing administrative power. specific operators or commodities to maximize the interests of themselves or others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023 is the 15th anniversary of the implementation of the Anti-Monopoly Law. The &quot;Regulations on Preventing the Abuse of Administrative Power to Eliminate or Restrict Competition&quot; have also been revised. Starting from April 15, 2023 Effective from today. Since March 2022, the State Administration for Market Regulation has launched a nationwide special campaign to stop the abuse of administrative power and exclude and restrict competition from law enforcement. From June 2022 to January 2023, a total of 5 batches and 63 administrative monopoly cases were announced. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2023, the State Administration for Market Regulation will launch a special anti-monopoly law enforcement action in the field of people&#39;s livelihood. The two batches of typical cases currently announced include 6 administrative monopoly cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In September 2023, the behavior of the Dingnan County Urban Management Bureau was reported as a typical case of anti-administrative monopoly. At present, the Dingnan County Urban Management Bureau has made rectifications, canceled the contract, and issued an announcement to fully open the shared electric vehicle market in the main urban area of ​​the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;With &quot;good intentions&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;October 2023 On the 18th, relevant staff from the Dingnan County Urban Management Bureau told Southern Weekend reporters that they had canceled the bidding. The Harbin Urban Management Bureau, which was put under investigation for the same reason, stated that the shared bicycle bidding business has been handed over to the Municipal Transportation Management Bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporters found that in 69 cases, a total of 69 administrative agencies were punished. Generally speaking, the cases involved are mainly concentrated in the fields of people&#39;s livelihood such as urban management, medical care, education, and construction. Chen Bing explained that industry supervision in these fields has obvious characteristics, and administrative agencies can directly allocate resources during the management process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Judging from the typical cases published, the motivations of the units involved are different, and some administrative monopoly behaviors even occur out of &quot;good intentions.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In March 2022, the Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau of Xiangshan County, Ningbo City issued a recommended list of housing safety appraisal institutions, requiring those who carry out housing safety appraisal business in Xiangshan County to obtain the municipal certification After filing the certificate with the Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau, you should register with the County Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau. In October 2022, the Zhejiang Provincial Market Supervision Bureau determined that this behavior constituted the abuse of administrative power to exclude and restrict competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A staff member of the Xiangshan County Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau told Southern Weekend reporters that their original intention was to facilitate the masses, “They always ask questions like this when they come to do business. ——We don’t know which housing safety agencies to look for for appraisal, so we put the list of nearly 20 registered agencies on the official account of the County Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The above-mentioned staff emphasized that house safety appraisal is a bottom-line issue. They need to comprehensively analyze the qualifications, capabilities, and creditworthiness of all appraisal agencies before making it public. Therefore, they A directory of housing safety appraisal agencies registered in Ningbo City will be formed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the investigation, the Xiangshan County Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau has withdrawn the recommended list. However, this staff member believes that if there are only one or two houses, it may be a monopoly. However, their recommended list includes more than a dozen housing safety appraisal agencies from Ningbo and Hangzhou, and &quot;there is none in Xiangshan.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, some administrative agencies are not aware that the documents issued constitute an administrative monopoly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In August 2017, the Finance Bureau of Pingluo County, Ningxia designated an insurance company as the underwriting unit for traffic accident insurance for various administrative institutions in the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The person in charge of the relevant departments of the Pingluo County Finance Bureau said that because the document was released for so long, the drafter of the document and the person responsible for its preparation and issuance are no longer in the bureau. They had not noticed this document before. It was not until March 2023, when the Market Supervision Bureau came to investigate, that they found the document and invalidated the relevant provisions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When it comes to the implementation of the document, the person in charge said that it also depends on the budget of each unit. Some units are implementing it, while others have not. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sun Jin, director of the Competition Law and Policy Research Center of Wuhan University, believes that administrative agencies lack the concept of fair competition in the policy formulation process and often only think about bidding and investment. Introducing investment to stimulate the economy while ignoring the need to maintain the bottom line of fair competition in the market can easily lead to the emergence of administrative monopolies. &lt;strong>; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; sp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp ;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Antitrust and Anti-Corruption&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;Among the reported administrative monopoly cases, the common handling methods are to abrogate the execution of the original documents, terminate the bidding work or cancel the contract, and submit a rectification report. There are also cases where the market supervision and administration administration issues administrative proposals to the local people&#39;s government, and a few supervisors Personnel and those directly responsible were punished, often involving corruption such as power-for-money transactions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In April 2021, the Chenzhou City Education Bureau of Hunan Province identified 4 school uniform production and supply manufacturers through bidding, and divided the urban area into 4 areas, limiting each area. Regional schools can only purchase uniforms from designated manufacturers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Hunan Provincial Market Supervision Bureau believed during its investigation in August 2021 that the above-mentioned behavior deprived the school and the parent committee of the right to make independent choices. As a result, the bidding process was terminated in September 2021. (The special action in 2022 announced 5 batches of 63 typical cases, 23 of which were filed for investigation in 2021.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;October 18, 2023, A staff member of the Chenzhou City Education Bureau office said that the technical equipment department, a secondary organization under the Education Bureau, is responsible for the primary and secondary school uniform business. Due to disciplinary violations in the public bidding process for the qualification of primary and secondary school uniform manufacturers, this organization was suspended midway. The Administration for Market Regulation called a halt, and the Commission for Discipline Inspection subsequently intervened in the investigation, and the person in charge of the agency was also punished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Chenzhou Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection pointed out that from 2013 to 2022, Li Junhong took advantage of his position as deputy director and director of the Technical Equipment Department of the Chenzhou Municipal Education Bureau to facilitate others. Undertaken primary and secondary schools uniform business, school laboratories, facilities and equipment and installation service procurement projects to provide assistance, illegally receiving other people&#39;s property totaling 2.448 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In June 2022, Li Junhong was expelled from the party and dismissed from public office. Suspected criminal issues were transferred to the procuratorate for review and prosecution in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After being punished, the Chenzhou Municipal Education Bureau took rectification measures. The above-mentioned staff stated that the Education Bureau, together with the Municipal Development and Reform Commission and the Municipal Supervision Bureau, issued a notice on further standardizing the management of primary and secondary school uniforms on September 15, 2021, emphasizing that all documents and materials for the selection and purchase of school uniforms should be archived by the school. School uniforms Procurement contracts must be filed with the competent education department, and transactions shall not be interfered with by violating market principles or by fixing trademarks or other methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, a monopoly case involving the Health Bureau of Shuangfeng County, Hunan Province is also worthy of attention. At the end of October 2021, relevant companies in the county jointly reported that the Shuangfeng County Health Bureau signed an agreement with a company to issue mandatory target tasks for drug procurement by county-affiliated public medical institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;An investigation by the Hunan Market Supervision Bureau found that Shuangfeng County Health Bureau signed a cooperation agreement with Sinopharm Holding Changsha Co., Ltd., requiring all public medical institutions in Shuangfeng County to A certain proportion of the purchase volume of medicines, consumables, equipment, etc. is provided to Sinopharm Holding Changsha Co., Ltd., and the Shuangfeng County Health Bureau also issues quotas in the form of documents to public medical institutions in the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The agreement also stipulates that from July 2021 to the end of 2022, the total purchase quota from public medical institutions in Shuangfeng County to Sinopharm Holding Changsha Co., Ltd. is 1.2 billion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 19, 2023, a reporter from Southern Weekend contacted the person in charge of the Essential Drugs Unit of Shuangfeng County Health Bureau who is responsible for drug procurement and asked about the whole story. The other party said, &quot;I don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t want to talk about it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Sun Jin’s view, antitrust is often closely related to anti-corruption. Some companies rack their brains to maintain relationships with officials with decision-making power, waiting for the time to mature. , they will require the other party to formulate rules to protect their interests, such as granting exclusive business rights, or giving opportunities in policy preferences, incentives and subsidies, and bidding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;This also means that some market entities will also push administrative agencies to abuse administrative power.&quot; Sun Jin added. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;The harm of administrative monopoly&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Compared to the economy Sexual monopoly and administrative monopoly rarely come into public view. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chen Bing believes that on the one hand, there are indeed fewer cases of administrative monopoly than economic monopoly cases; on the other hand, administrative monopoly is mainly ordered to correct and punished by superior authorities. The focus is on punishing supervisors or other responsible personnel in accordance with the law, and the punishment information does not belong to the content that must be disclosed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;But administrative monopoly is more harmful than economic monopoly.&quot; Chen Bing explained that administrative monopoly sets unreasonable entry barriers, causing market Fragmentation and misallocation of resources prevent other operators from making full use of their own advantages to participate in competition. In the long run, this will reduce the competitiveness and innovation capabilities of all enterprises in the market, and at the same time reduce the total social welfare. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sun Jin believes that for anti-monopoly law enforcement agencies, anti-economic monopoly is mainly a technical issue, and it is not difficult to judge whether it has substantially hindered fair market competition. Not big. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He emphasized that the hard nut of anti-monopoly is actually administrative monopoly. At present, abuse of power still occurs from time to time, and it is still very serious in some areas. In addition, in administrative monopolies, there is a large amount of interest transfer, and some companies gain unfair competitive advantages, suppress small and medium-sized enterprises, and compete for their profit opportunities. This is contrary to common prosperity, high-quality development, and the construction of a unified national market. Anti-administrative monopoly has always been the top priority of anti-monopoly work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is worth noting that on August 1, 2022, the first day the new Anti-Monopoly Law came into effect, Gan Lin, Director of the State Anti-Monopoly Bureau, published an article in the &quot;People&#39;s Daily&quot; The signed article mentioned that &quot;we must insist on equal emphasis on preventing market monopoly and breaking administrative monopoly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the 2023 National Market Supervision System Anti-Monopoly Work Conference, anti-administrative monopoly is also the focus of the 2023 work goals, including strengthening the supply of fair competition review systems , studying and drafting the &quot;Fair Competition Review Regulations (Draft)&quot;, etc. At present, the &quot;Fair Competition Review Regulations&quot; have been publicly solicited for opinions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the 15 years since the Anti-Monopoly Law was implemented, the fair competition review mechanism has been an important part of the anti-administrative monopoly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2016, the State Council issued the &quot;Opinions on Establishing a Fair Competition Review System in the Construction of the Market System&quot;, emphasizing standardizing government behavior and establishing a fair competition review system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A landmark node is that the State Administration for Market Regulation was officially listed in April 2018 and began to assume unified anti-monopoly law enforcement responsibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In June 2022, the Anti-Monopoly Law was revised for the first time after its promulgation. The chapter involving anti-administrative monopoly added a fair competition review system. &quot;This is equivalent to controlling the situation from the source and reducing the impact of policies formulated by administrative agencies on market competition,&quot; Chen Bing analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Breaking down regional barriers&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Relevant regulations and policies are constantly evolving While improving, anti-administrative monopoly law enforcement has also been continuously strengthened. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The special anti-administrative monopoly action in 2022 is not the first time. From September 2019 to January 2020, the State Administration for Market Regulation carried out special actions nationwide to stop the abuse of administrative power and exclude and restrict competition from law enforcement, focusing on transportation, construction, medicine, official seal engraving, bidding and government procurement5 an area where there are many illegal activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the special operation, the market supervision department investigated more than 50 cases in the above five fields and verified more than 80 case clues. However, no typical cases were announced to the public at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, the State Administration for Market Regulation has published an annual report on antitrust enforcement every year since its establishment. The report shows that from 2019 to 2022, law enforcement agencies investigated a total of 354 cases of abuse of administrative power to eliminate or restrict competition, and concluded 198 cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Among them, the numbers of such cases investigated from 2019 to 2021 were 84, 98, and 80 respectively, and the numbers settled were 12, 67, and 46 respectively. The State Administration for Market Regulation launched a special law enforcement action on the abuse of administrative power to exclude and restrict competition in 2022, investigating a total of 92 cases and settling 73 cases. The number of settlements increased by 59% compared with 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In contrast, in the eleven years from 2008 to 2018, antitrust law enforcement agencies investigated and dealt with a total of 223 such cases, with an average of approximately 20 cases; and in the four years from 2019 to 2022, the average was 88 cases per year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The fair competition review system is also constantly being implemented and promoted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2019, the fair competition review system achieved full coverage of the national, provincial, municipal, and county governments. As of the end of 2020, a total of 857,000 newly issued policies had been reviewed across the country, and more than 4,100 policy measures that violated review standards were discovered and corrected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2022 alone, various regions and departments will review 163,700 newly issued policies and measures, clean up 452,000 existing policies and measures of various types, and abolish, revise, and correct There are more than 20,000 policies and measures to eliminate or restrict competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In other words, these policy documents that may affect fair competition in the market have not been issued because they have not passed the fair competition review, or previously issued documents have been abolished because they have not passed the review. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Overall, the anti-administrative monopoly work has a long way to go, and there are still some problems that need to be solved urgently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chen Bing pointed out that on the one hand, it is necessary to break down local protection and regional barriers, thoroughly clean up policies and practices that hinder market access and the free circulation of commodity factors, and reduce institutional Transaction costs are the key to breaking down barriers that restrict economic circulation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the other hand, it is necessary to continuously regulate the interference of administrative power in market competition, &quot;especially in the fields of bidding, government procurement, public utilities and other fields, to prevent designated transactions , discriminatory conditions and other unfair behaviors, allowing local governments to effectively form an integrated competition protection mechanism of &#39;pre-examination + in-process and post-event supervision&#39;.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Sun Jin’s view, consciousness and concepts are the core issues. He believes that antitrust laws need to be popularized among government officials so that they can make scientific, reasonable and legal decisions based on the provisions of antitrust laws and fair competition review systems. “Consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises also need to be mobilized to supervise the government, and all parties can work together to promote An ecology of fair competition.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[跨国药企扎堆进博会，多款创新药首秀]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260172]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 10:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[被传收购碧桂园？中国平安回应]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260182]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 09:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On November 8, foreign media reported the news of Ping An’s acquisition of Country Garden. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/4b28e3afa0ab6ee807d2c994e8a6fd08.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;427&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/4b28e3afa0ab6ee807d2c994e8a6fd08.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257517&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, Ping An issued a statement saying that the company has noticed a news report published by Reuters about the company being required by relevant government departments/institutions to acquire Country Garden Holdings Co., Ltd. and inherit its debts.

On the morning of October 21, 2023, local time in Bolivia, the Shaolin cultural delegation watched the Shaolin Kungfu report performance of Bolivian Shaolin disciples and interacted on the spot. While in Bolivia, the Shaolin cultural delegation also visited the South American Shaolin Cultural Center, Bolivia Baoen Temple and other places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Prior to this, a video on Weibo of a young black monk practicing Shaolin Kung Fu also sparked heated discussions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only is the young monk boxing in the video black, but the master is also black. This is a branch of the Shaolin Temple in Africa. Some people say that this is the flowering of Chinese culture within the wall and the loss of culture; the Shaolin Temple is becoming more and more international, making people feel that it has lost its original flavor. This view is of course wrong, and someone has refuted it very well: once it is exported, it will be lost, and if it is not exported, it will be criticized as cultural weakness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shaolin Temple has been engaged in systematic cultural dissemination, forming many practice platforms that influence and disseminate Shaolin Kungfu and its culture, and building a global dissemination mechanism centered on Shaolin culture at home and abroad. It has had a huge social impact. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2001, Shaolin layman &quot;foreign disciple&quot; Deller opened the Shaolin Cultural Center in Berlin, Germany. This was the first overseas branch directly authorized to cooperate with the Shaolin Temple. Currently, there are nearly 200 overseas Shaolin cultural centers distributed around the world. According to data from relevant institutions, there are no less than 60 million people practicing Shaolin Kung Fu around the world; there are hundreds of Shaolin cultural institutions in more than 100 countries and regions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2010, the &quot;Shaolin European Federation&quot; was established in Vienna; in 2004, the California House of Representatives unanimously passed a resolution and established in law March 21 of each year as &quot;Songshan Shaolin Temple Day&quot;. In 2010, the &quot;Shaolin European Federation&quot; was announced in Vienna, Austria; in 2011, the &quot;Shaolin North American Federation&quot; was established in Los Angeles, the United States. In 2014, the 10th anniversary of the establishment of &quot;Songshan Shaolin Temple Day&quot; in California, the then US President Obama said in his congratulatory message: &quot;Shaolin culture can provide us with spiritual space and help us cultivate a strong sense of social responsibility.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Shaolin Temple recruits foreign disciples and even goes out to build temples and Kung Fu training classes, which can not only promote Buddhism, but also Shaolin Kung Fu and spread Chinese culture. Shaolin Temple is the place where Patriarch Bodhidharma stayed the longest after he came to China. It is known as the ancestral palace of Zen Buddhism. Zen Buddhism absorbs a large amount of ideological content from Confucianism and Taoism, turning foreign Buddhism into a Chinese Buddhism that corresponds to China&#39;s specific social and historical conditions and ideological and cultural background. Therefore, Zen Buddhism has realized the transformation from the Sinicization of Buddhism to Sinicized Buddhism and is rich in profound Chinese cultural elements. Shaolin Kung Fu and Shaolin Temple have gone global, and Chinese culture has also expanded its influence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although black young monks and black abbots seem to be inconsistent, it is just because they are not used to it. It should be pointed out that the process of cultural export, success and acceptance cannot remain unchanged. It will also change and alienate according to local social, cultural, technological, economic, moral, conceptual and other factors, forming new ones to some extent. culture. We must maintain a tolerant attitude toward such changes and mutations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, the influence of the Chinese New Year (Spring Festival) is growing, and many countries and regions have designated the Chinese New Year as a legal holiday. There will be a holiday on this day, and national and regional leaders will extend holiday greetings to those celebrating the Spring Festival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the international context, the Chinese New Year is often written as: Chinese new year. &quot;Happy Chinese New Year&quot; is translated as &quot;Happy Chinese New Year&quot;, indicating that this New Year comes from the Chinese calendar. However, with the growing influence of the Spring Festival, there is now a trend to translate the Spring Festival into &quot;Lunar New Year&quot;. Lunar means &quot;moon&quot; and can be understood as &quot;lunar calendar&quot;. Nowadays, many people use it this way. US officials use &quot;Lunar New Year&quot; when issuing New Year greetings. United Nations Secretary-General Guterres also used &quot;Lunar New Year&quot; in his New Year greeting video. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people say that this is an attempt to de-Sinicize the Spring Festival and steal a Chinese festival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You don’t have to look at it this way. This is the normal state of cultural export. The Romans originally used the Egyptian lunar calendar. In 46 BC, Roman commander Julius Caesar decided to recompile the Julian Calendar based on the Egyptian solar calendar. In 325 AD, the Roman Emperor Constantine established the Julian calendar as the Christian calendar. By the 6th century AD, Christians regarded the day when Jesus, the founder of Christian legends, was born more than 500 years ago as the first year of AD. Before the 16th century, most Western countries adopted the Julian calendar. In 1582, Pope Gregory XIII, with the assistance of the Neapolitan astronomer and physicist Giraldi and the German mathematician and Jesuit Clavius, corrected the Julian calendar promulgated in 46 BC. Errors formed the Gregorian calendar commonly used in our modern society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Revolution of 1911, the Provisional Government of the Republic of China legislated to use the Gregorian calendar from January 1, 1912, and stipulated that January 1 of the Gregorian calendar would be the &quot;New Year&quot;. This is now recognized around the world as the starting point of the new year. However, now everyone in the world can only say &quot;Happy New Year&quot; but not &quot;Happy Roman New Year&quot;. This is not stealing a holiday from the Romans or Christians, but a normal process of cultural export. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many countries in Asia also celebrate the Lunar New Year, such as South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, etc. From their perspective, they may not want to use an obviously regional name like &quot;Chinese&quot;, so they will use &quot;Happy Lunar New Year&quot; to express &quot;Happy Spring Festival&quot;, which is just like the Chinese people don&#39;t know how to express &quot;Happy Lunar New Year&quot;. It&#39;s the same as saying &quot;Happy New Year Roman&quot;, but what does it matter? This calendar was passed down from China. Under the tributary system in the traditional era, the Chinese dynasty would issue calendars and allow surrounding vassal states to &quot;honor Shuo&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, whether it is African black Shaolin Temple disciples or it is called &quot;Lunar New Year&quot;, it is a real cultural export. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[争论“开门杀”责任与赔偿：为何司机负主责，为何保险要代赔]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260160]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Taxi parked on the roadside in Beijing. &quot;Opening the door to kill&quot; has become a hot topic in recent years .

Pictures and texts are irrelevant. Yi Haifei China News Service Visual China Map&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In mid-October 2023, the incident of a child in Tianjin being &quot;killed by opening the door&quot; and then being run over by a bus attracted attention. While riding an electric bicycle to carry her daughter, a woman hit the newly opened door of a passenger bus on the side of the road. The child fell to the ground and was crushed to death by the wheels of a passing bus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is another &quot;open door killing&quot; case. Southern Weekend reporters searched the relevant judicial documents website and found that in recent years, &quot;open door killing&quot; accidents have occurred frequently. Dai Xianfeng, secretary-general of the Legal Affairs Committee of the China Communications and Transportation Association, believes that with the substantial growth of private cars and non-motor vehicles, the public generally lacks awareness of the dangers of &quot;opening the door to kill&quot;, resulting in the frequent occurrence of such accidents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dai Xianfeng told Southern Weekend reporters that door-opening killings are mainly divided into two types: one is when the driver opens the door himself and collides with a non-motorized vehicle, in which case the driver bears full responsibility; If a passenger opens the door and collides with a non-motor vehicle, the passenger will generally constitute a joint tort with the driver. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The latter situation can be subdivided into different accident types, and the final liability for compensation will also be different. Two common situations are: the driver and the passenger have an operational relationship, such as taxis, online ride-hailing and other passenger-carrying activities; the driver and the passenger are friends or relatives, and there is no operational relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;&#39;Opening the door to kill&#39; is a hot topic in traffic accidents. It is very lethal and its liability determination has always been controversial.&quot; Zhou Bo, a senior lawyer who has been representing traffic accident cases for many years, added that at present, all over China The traffic control department in China still lacks unified identification standards when determining responsibility for &quot;opening the door to kill&quot; accidents. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;What responsibilities does the online ride-hailing platform bear?&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At 18:00 on November 3, 2020, just after work, 39-year-old Zhang He was riding an electric bicycle on the non-motorized lane on his way home. He collided with an online ride-hailing car that had just opened the door, causing Zhang He to be seriously injured and unconscious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The incident occurred on Zhongshan 2nd Road, Songjiang District, Shanghai. Relevant judgments show that after completing a trip, the online ride-hailing driver Xia Moulin temporarily stopped the vehicle and did not keep the vehicle close to the right side of the road. He also did not remind passenger Fang Mouxin to observe the traffic coming from behind. Fang Mouxin opened the right door. , resulting in Zhang He’s injury. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“My husband now can’t even remember the names of his father, mother and son, nor his own name.” Zhang He’s wife told Southern Weekend reporters that Zhang He was originally the backbone of the family because The car accident resulted in a craniocerebral injury that constituted a tenth-level disability, and the treatment has not healed yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The traffic police detachment of the Songjiang Branch of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau determined that the driver Xia Moulin bore the primary responsibility for the accident, the passenger Fang Mouxin bore the secondary responsibility, and Zhang He was not responsible. The court later ruled that the driver and passenger constituted joint infringement. Among them, the driver&#39;s compensation ratio is 70%, and the compensation is 820,000 yuan; the passenger&#39;s compensation ratio is 30%, and the compensation is 350,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The transportation department will first issue an accident liability determination document to determine the primary and secondary responsibilities of the driver and passengers. Later, the court will make a judgment based on the liability determination document during the trial.&quot; Dai Xianfeng told Southern Weekend reporters , the responsibility determination letter issued by the transportation department will not clarify the responsibilities of the driver and passengers into specific proportions. As for how the final court divides the proportion of primary and secondary responsibilities, it is within the scope of the people&#39;s court to exercise discretion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that the judgment of the above-mentioned case shows that Xia Moulin did not actually have insurance related to operating vehicles when using a private car, and his online ride-hailing platform Didi Chuxing Company failed to perform its due review duties. ; And as a platform, Didi and Xia Moulin share profits, bear risks, and ensure operational safety, and they are both considered as the carrier of passengers. Therefore, Didi shall bear joint and several liability with the driver Xia Moulin for the losses suffered by the injured in accordance with the law, and jointly compensate 820,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Regardless of whether the online ride-hailing car has the relevant qualifications to operate a vehicle or not, the driver taking the order is regarded as performing his duties. The driver may not be an employee of Didi, but legally, as long as he performs his work tasks , the platform has the responsibility.&quot; Dai Xianfeng said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 16 of the &quot;Interim Measures for the Administration of Online Reservation Taxi Operations and Services&quot; stipulates: &quot;Online taxi-hailing platform companies assume the responsibility of the carrier and should ensure operational safety and protect the legitimate rights and interests of passengers.&quot; The Chinese Civil Code also states Relevant regulations require online ride-hailing platforms to assume the responsibilities of the carrier under the transportation contract between the driver and the passenger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This means that when facing consumers, the carrier’s responsibilities and compensation obligations originally belonging to the driver under the transportation contract may be borne by the online ride-hailing platform to a large extent. The same goes for taxi drivers and taxi companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If a passenger pushes the door and causes a &quot;door kill&quot;, but the driver has fulfilled his obligation to remind him, does he still need to bear responsibility? Dai Xianfeng told Southern Weekend reporters: &quot;Unless the passenger was intentional, the driver still needs to bear certain liability for the accident. There is a platform or insurance company behind the driver, which has a stronger compensation ability. It is the substantive fairness of the law to allow the victim to receive compensation according to the law. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But not all situations require the owner of a motor vehicle to be held responsible. Zhou Bo added to Southern Weekend reporters that if a vehicle parked on the roadside and opened its door in compliance with regulations, and a non-motor vehicle drove in the wrong direction or caused an &quot;open door kill&quot; casualty accident due to other reasons, the traffic control department may also determine that the non-motor vehicle bears major or even full responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Should insurance recognize the car or the person?&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Zhou Bo told Southern Weekend reporters that in the case of &quot;open door killing&quot; caused by passengers, there are two main controversial links: one One is how the front-end traffic control department determines the primary and secondary responsibilities of the driver and passengers; the other is the insurance company that insures the vehicle. Should it compensate on behalf of the passengers? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The most critical link is the identification of front-end responsibilities, under what circumstances passengers should bear responsibility, how to divide primary and secondary responsibilities, and under what circumstances passengers are not required to bear responsibility.” Zhou Bo told Southern Weekend reporters that the traffic control department The methods and standards for determining responsibility are currently not uniform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, in the &quot;open door killing&quot; cases represented by Zhou Bo, the identification standards of traffic police in various places have been different, which also directly affected the final court judgment. For example, when they both open the door for a passenger, some traffic police believe that the passenger and the driver are one and the same tortfeasor; some traffic police believe that the driver should bear full responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, a judgment made public in 2020 showed that after a &quot;door-opening killing&quot; accident occurred in Luocheng County, Guangxi, the &quot;Road Traffic Accident Determination&quot; issued by the local traffic police department on the accident involved determined that the passenger If you obstruct the passage of other vehicles when opening and closing the door, you will bear all the responsibility for the traffic accident. The driver is not responsible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dai Xianfeng said that under normal circumstances, the court&#39;s judgment will be consistent with the accident liability determination issued by the transportation department, unless there is other direct evidence to the contrary that is sufficient to overturn the liability determination. &quot;On the one hand, from a professional perspective, judges are no better at handling traffic accidents than traffic police; on the other hand, the probative power of evidence issued by state agencies is higher than other general evidence.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If the driver is responsible If the passenger is fully responsible, there will not be much controversy, because the insurance company will pay in the end. But if the passenger is held responsible, there will be controversy.&quot; Zhou Bo said that when the passenger is found responsible, the main point of dispute will become : Should the insurance company that insures the vehicle bear the liability of the passengers? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters checked multiple judicial documents and found that when the driver and the passenger who took the initiative to open the door did not have an operating relationship, but were relatives or friends, many drivers would claim that they were fully responsible. The reason is that drivers, as car owners, have purchased compulsory traffic insurance or commercial third party insurance, and the insurance company can compensate them on their behalf. It is precisely because of this that in such &quot;open door killing&quot; cases, there are endless lawsuits between insurance companies and the infringers of the cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2019, a &quot;door-opening killing&quot; accident occurred in Fengtai District, Beijing. The car driver Zhang Mouyan was friends with the passenger Ma Mou who pushed the door open. After handling by the Fengbei Brigade of Fengtai Traffic Detachment, the car owner and passengers in this case were equally responsible for the accident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In court, the car advocate Mouyan argued that he failed to fulfill his obligation to remind and should bear full responsibility. Passenger Ma Moushuang also pointed out that if there is no vehicle, there is no act of getting out of the vehicle. Insurance companies should identify the insured vehicle rather than the person who caused the vehicle accident. The insurance company argued that the company was only responsible for the insured car claimant&#39;s compensation amount, that is, compensation at a rate of 50%, and did not recognize that Zhang Mouyan bore full responsibility. It said: &quot;According to the insurance law, Zhang Mouyan violated the principle of good faith and took the initiative to increase her own responsibilities, which may have resulted in excessive compensation for our company. Our company reserves the right to pursue the two of them for insurance fraud.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the end, the court ruled that the insurance company should be liable for the injured person&#39;s various losses within the scope of insurance based on the joint and several liability of the car owner and passengers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found that in such &quot;open door killing&quot; cases, there were many verdicts in which insurance companies were ultimately responsible for compensation on behalf of passengers. In the aforementioned &quot;open door killing&quot; case in Luocheng County, although the court ruled that the passengers were fully responsible, the final compensation for the injured was paid by the insurance company that insured the vehicle involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Insurance companies generally defend themselves. They believe that insurance compensation is for the insured car owner. Once the driver is not the car owner, no compensation should be paid. However, this defense opinion can only be said to have a certain degree of truth, and the court often does not Adopted.&quot; Zhou Bo said that at present, the exemption clause in this aspect of the insurance contract itself is not clear, and different people will have different understandings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, some online ride-hailing platforms and taxi companies require passengers to open the right door to get in and out of the car as a measure to prevent &quot;open door killing&quot;. Dai Xianfeng believes that it is necessary to strengthen the education and publicity related to &quot;opening the door to kill&quot; for students: &quot;I think that &#39;opening the door to kill&#39; should also be a key part of the training when taking the driver&#39;s license test. We will ask to look at the reflector before starting and after stopping the car. , but there is no direct training for &#39;opening the door to kill&#39;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_ GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(Zhou Bo and Zhang He are pseudonyms in the article)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt; br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https:/ /feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[改革开放45周年—建言者]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260156]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 23:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;45 years ago, under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping’s requirement to “turn banks into real banks”, China began a planned and Step-by-step financial system reform. Finance, the core of the modern economy, has been given an extraordinary mission in China&#39;s reform process. 45 years ago, the People&#39;s Bank of China and the Ministry of Finance separated, and China&#39;s &quot;unified&quot; financial system reform began. Although it was once trapped in the reform detour of the &quot;Five Major Contracts&quot;, it entered a &quot;big step&quot; process since 1993. 45 years later, &quot;deepening the reform of the financial system&quot; has become the action plan, and the reform and opening up of the financial market has also entered the deep water zone. Taking history as a mirror can help us understand gains and losses. To this end, we conducted in-depth interviews with the promoters, experiencers and witnesses of China&#39;s financial reform and opening up to provide suggestions for the stable and long-term development of China&#39;s financial industry.</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 23:55:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
