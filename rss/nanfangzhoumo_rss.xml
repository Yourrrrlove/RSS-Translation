The first victim&#39;s apprentice, Qu Sangeng (played by Bai Yufan), and Yamen&#39;s official Song Chen (played by Ning Li) join the game and solve the case with other companions...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When following this drama, there is always a kind of thing to watch. The feeling of &quot;Along the River During Qingming Festival&quot;. &quot;Along the River During the Qingming Festival&quot; is a genre painting by the Northern Song Dynasty painter Zhang Zeduan. It is very long and full of details. What comes to mind is the antique style and worldly sentiments. Looking more closely, there are many characters with different shapes, and there are twists and turns behind each person. A long story; magnify it 10 times and it will give you a different scenery. It is rumored that there are unknown secrets hidden in the pictures, and there are lice crawling in the Chinese clothes. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This coincides with &quot;Under the City&quot;. The plot unfolds by peeling off the cocoon, using Jingwei County to observe the style of the late Ming Dynasty, lamenting the fate of the characters, and watching the moths walking through the sturdy towers. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;World conditions, society and the style of the late Ming Dynasty&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When viewing paintings, it is important to first look at the overall situation, and the same is true for watching dramas. When you open &quot;Under the City&quot;, you will be drawn into the story by its highly restored late Ming aesthetics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Stylization is its key word. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The smoky alleys covered with green moss due to perennial humidity, the smoky willow alleys with the setting sun reflected in the fragrance of rotten flowers, the yamen torture chambers with no sunlight and only the smell of blood...these seemingly inadvertent... The lens is full of long-lasting charm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/6ffe9ed43a58c151859bba963bc768bd.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;2700&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/6ffe9ed43a58c151859bba963bc768bd.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255224&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Preliminary art work When planning the design, the crew scanned many ancient architectural models for reference, and made more than 60 sets of three-dimensional models and more than 150 atmosphere pictures. The scenery and furnishings pursue realism and freehand brushwork, and perfectly restore the style of the late Ming Dynasty in a balance between reality and reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/2e329b69043fad7c8d8e0ef480f8ce95.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;961&quot; height= &quot;764&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/2e329b69043fad7c8d8e0ef480f8ce95.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255221&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Each role They are all designed with matching looks. The book boy Lu Zhi alone has 16 outfits. The police uniform that Qu Sangen often wears is designed based on the historical data of the Ming Dynasty and incorporates the texture of ink. The easily overlooked waist accessories reveal the differences in status between people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/4727c1fdf575eecbc3eec34640648f40.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1200&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/4727c1fdf575eecbc3eec34640648f40.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255226&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Servantization It is the most intuitive measuring stick that can accurately mark the style of the era. Only by constructing a real and credible environment can the audience enter the plot and be better immersed in the mysteries of Fancheng. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that this drama uses a 2.042:1 widescreen format, which is different from the traditional 4:3 or 16:9 format. The extension of the width means that the depth of field of the lens is richer and the visual effects are closer to what is visible, which can enhance the audience&#39;s immersion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/adc88ec691b90e917c122de13ba898f0.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1623&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/adc88ec691b90e917c122de13ba898f0.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255227&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Narrative perspective and Classical Detective&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Looking at &quot;Along the River During the Qingming Festival&quot;, I often feel dazzled. I see the spring scenery in the countryside with my left eye, and the shops along the river with my right eye. &quot;Under the City&quot; is just like it. From any perspective, you can smoothly enter different narratives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Episodes 1-3 focus on the perspective of the little catcher, the death of the master Leng catcher is presented from his subjective lens. The master died tragically, the wife lost her life, the body of an old servant was found, and the murderer was rampant. In the middle of the night, he was confused and confused among different forces to investigate the case, and accidentally discovered the Lu family fire case 20 years ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/91b6957ac720f205122ffde0fbee597e.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;883&quot; height= &quot;497&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/91b6957ac720f205122ffde0fbee597e.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255225&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With peers Coats Cong and close friend Feng Ke pursue friendship; express condolences to his junior wife and junior sister; visit witnesses of old cases... Qu Sangeng&#39;s social relationships are laid out, and little people with their own concerns are introduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/e7e4b9a7330a5fc284c36cb576d22c04.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;883&quot; height= &quot;497&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/e7e4b9a7330a5fc284c36cb576d22c04.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255229&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the 4th Episode, the plot suddenly switches to 20 years ago, when the Lu family was still prosperous, and the conversation was handed over to their bookboy Lu Zhi. He is smart and smart, and is favored by everyone in the Lu family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/fed6dff701201c04cabac9dfa68e3b75.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;883&quot; height= &quot;497&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/fed6dff701201c04cabac9dfa68e3b75.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255230&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By him From the perspective of the protagonist, Mr. Lu, the servant Chen Wang, and the mute Mr. Zhong appear one by one. The bustling Lu Mansion hides many secrets. Lu Zhi accidentally discovered the love relationship between Captain Leng and Master Lu&#39;s lover, and also learned about the strange relationship between Master Wang and his students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/cd5a1449ca797fb69e77f9662ec00431.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;883&quot; height= &quot;497&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/cd5a1449ca797fb69e77f9662ec00431.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255231&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;See here Looking back at the murder cases in the first three episodes, you will be surprised to find that everything seems to be correct. Leng Captou, Wang Fuzi, and Chen Wang are all inextricably linked to the Lu family back then. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Episode 5 changed to an omniscient perspective, giving viewers new clues: a new headhunter eager to establish his power in the yamen, Qu Sangeng and Gao Shicong continue to hunt for the murder, and the neighbors&#39; mouths There is a troublesome monkey demon. The seemingly irrelevant case of the Xianbi Monkey Monster has brought back an old case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The length of each episode is different. It is not deliberately divided into 45-minute episodes. The beginning and end of the paragraph are used as time mark nodes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With different narrative perspectives, the audience can receive different information. They can not only sympathize with San Geng who is single-mindedly pursuing the murderer, but also follow Lu Zhi breathlessly to explore the origins of the past, and even chatter in the street. Put an ear leisurely in the middle. The past and present, old events and new cases are flexibly connected together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Modern suspense dramas often follow a socialist approach, while ancient suspense dramas represented by this drama are rooted in sophisticated and solid classicism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Under the City&quot; emphasizes the supremacy of logic, with puzzle solving and trickery as its core: the horrific serial murders are the appetizer, and the highlight is the case within the case, the mystery within the mystery, and the love within the love. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Twenty years ago, undercurrents surged in the Lu Mansion, which was whitewashing peace. The adopted &quot;Master Qian&quot; Lu Zhi was very curious. He stirred up many mysteries of the adult world and also spied on the seemingly unknown world. The hidden secrets of the people involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/7e9a57a888937c8a370640eab69e6c2f.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;883&quot; height= &quot;554&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/7e9a57a888937c8a370640eab69e6c2f.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255232&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He is Lu The survivor of the house fire is also a key connecting the past and present time and space, just like the mysterious monkey whose whereabouts are unknown. The dead 20 years later are all the players in the game in the past, so who is the player in the game? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The thorny question was thrown to Detective Qu Sangen. He and his companions walked around the streets and visited everywhere. Their footprints were everywhere from the case library to Yanliu Lane. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/0ab156112d7688742ce91053be888f74.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;883&quot; height= &quot;497&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/0ab156112d7688742ce91053be888f74.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255234&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Detection is not With the help of strange powers and chaotic gods, there is no help from high-tech technology. It can be said that it is quite in line with the ancient tradition to rely solely on brain power and leg power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/b64e9a8d6036eadcb18af6669bace0aa.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;883&quot; height= &quot;497&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/b64e9a8d6036eadcb18af6669bace0aa.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255236&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, due to The unique narrative method of the series does not hide information from the audience, and does not use camera language to mislead, so the amount of information the audience knows is always greater than that of the detective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We know the way of Captain Leng’s death one step earlier than Qu San, and we also know what happened to Lu Zhi 20 years ago before him. What we are looking forward to is how the detective puts the pieces together into a picture. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The fate of characters and the social ecological chain&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The first thing I felt when watching &quot;Along the River During the Qingming Festival&quot; was: prosperity and crowds. But if you zoom in and study half of the scroll, you will see the shadow of the prosperous age hidden in the details. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I first watched &quot;Under the Busty City&quot;, I felt that the market was prosperous and full of people. Officials, squires, traffickers and pawns, women with fireworks, all appeared on stage like a revolving lantern, roughly sketching out the portraits of the people in Jingxian County. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But when you zoom in under the microscope, you will find that everyone from state and county officials to ordinary people are included in a tightly interlocked social and ecological chain, and there are clever and hidden games everywhere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dian Shi Song Chen, Leng Captou and others have specific powers, but in the final analysis they are still low-level officials trapped in an increasingly rigid system and acting according to a set of hidden rules. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dian Shi was a miscellaneous official of the county magistrate. He had no specific rank but was ordered by the emperor to sign and approve. He was in charge of arrests, prisons and other matters, so Song Chen had a certain deterrent effect on arrests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fast class led by the catcher is responsible for arresting murders and investigating cases, and the soap class is responsible for the promotion of the court. There are many people like Gao Shicong in the play who spend money to work as temporary workers. So once something happens, Gao Shicong and others will be the first to be dismissed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/5434e1d86ea7305ac52af7967a2ad966.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;883&quot; height= &quot;1428&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/5434e1d86ea7305ac52af7967a2ad966.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255233&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Airborne Xia The head catcher is the type of person that the yamen is most afraid of because it is difficult to find out his background in a short period of time. Therefore, the petty official who usually showed off his power had to be beaten, and he had to bear the pain to watch him establish his power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/1eafb08470d481b123abd98e742c34fc.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;883&quot; height= &quot;775&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/1eafb08470d481b123abd98e742c34fc.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255235&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The imperial power does not decline The proverb &quot;county&quot; accurately describes the power vacuum zone below the county level in the feudal era. The lower-level officials have the power of flexible autonomy. Therefore, grassroots governance also relies on the black and white management system. It treats the common people one way, but treats the gangsters and bullies in another way. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Leng Captou controlled the lifeblood of Fangxing during his lifetime and reached a solid cooperative relationship with him. As long as it did not involve the abduction and trafficking of women and children, he would turn a blind eye. The bank &quot;pays&quot; him a fixed amount of money every month, and also does some dirty work when needed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The salaries of officials in the Ming Dynasty were very low, and quick-thinking people found solutions elsewhere. Part of the kickbacks taken by Leng Captou will be subsidized to the subordinates on the fast shift. But there are also honest officials like Song Chen, whose monthly salary is only enough to meet his sweetheart once. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/231e1c0322880ddcc2b8e159ef935769.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;883&quot; height= &quot;565&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/231e1c0322880ddcc2b8e159ef935769.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255238&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cold catcher After his death, it was replaced by Zaoban Yi to arrest the head and do business with the bank. However, he was evil-minded and greedy. He used power to make money with the ledger, which destroyed the delicate balance, aroused the anger of the masses, and even prompted Qu Sangeng to use scheming to get rid of him. Visit the bank and hit the bank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/eebae343f522ea7228e4ce7967f31088.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;883&quot; height= &quot;1825&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/eebae343f522ea7228e4ce7967f31088.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255237&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Use one paragraph It&#39;s very clever, like a story about the appearance of officialdom in ancient times. He took advantage of Capt. Yi&#39;s greedy weakness, pretending to surrender but secretly stumbling, reaping the benefits of the conflict between Capt. He also used the idea to let Yi Captou violate Song Chen&#39;s minefield of Qingfeng Liangxiu, and finally ended up being a different person inside and outside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/6a96d12fe399c1c84c5827957b4564e3.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;883&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/6a96d12fe399c1c84c5827957b4564e3.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255239&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Speaking of, Qu Sangeng is the character with the fullest growth arc in the play. In the beginning, he was a straightforward and cheerful person. He didn&#39;t have to understand the survival rules of the lower-level officials. He was protected by the cold catcher who was like his master and his father. After his master died, he was forced to grow up and started to do things that he didn&#39;t want to do before, such as Use mediation among the three religions and nine streams. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Essentially, he is the same type of person as Song Chen. It is inevitable to wear black gloves after staying in the mud for a long time, but there is a fire of justice in his heart that illuminates the way forward. It is not difficult to speculate that Song Chen will be his new guide and will perform the duties of his master. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/fbe94e7cb0ef6cfa0d2ece822efa9598.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;883&quot; height= &quot;497&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/fbe94e7cb0ef6cfa0d2ece822efa9598.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255240&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s it. Officials, let’s talk about civilians. Their ecological chain is also “big fish eat small fish, small fish eat shrimps.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qu Sangen stopped an incident of oppressing the people on the street. He beat the passers-by and pretended to be evil, and the fake scholar they found pretended to be innocent. They were trying to annex the game within a game. The old man’s property. If the illiterate old man does not receive help at midnight, he will be one of the hundreds or thousands of people who suffer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/473301c62431b66e80654a0145bc0c60.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;904&quot; height= &quot;1465&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/473301c62431b66e80654a0145bc0c60.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255244&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Lu family&#39;s The book boy Lu Zhi was intelligent by nature. When Mr. Lu was happy, he slapped his thigh and told him to get rid of his lowly status and let him take the exam for merit. In the Ming Dynasty, untouchables were not allowed to participate in scientific examinations unless they could clear their relationship and break away from their untouchable status. In addition, subordinate officials such as Qu Sangen had no right to take scientific examinations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/f705ffc52289396448673bf882f0bb19.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;883&quot; height= &quot;669&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/f705ffc52289396448673bf882f0bb19.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255242&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why Mr. Lu Can you get your household registration done with just a little money? Because he is a local squire and knows Juren. There were a large number of Juren in the Ming Dynasty, and those who wanted to be officials had to wait for vacancies. However, their social status was much higher than that of the general public.

Insurance, he believes: &quot;In addition to the normal natural decrease, an important reason is that residents actively surrender their insurance. This is mainly because premiums continue to rise. From 2003 to 2023, individual premiums increased 37 times in 20 years. The second The reason is that many uninsured residents are in good health.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This explanation is wrong. The National Medical Insurance Administration&#39;s &quot;2022 Medical Security Development Statistical Report&quot; makes it very clear: as of the end of 2022, the number of people insured by basic medical insurance was 1,345.7 million. With the launch of the national unified medical insurance information platform, all provinces have stepped up data management and comparison. The number of insured people has decreased by 17.27 million year-on-year, mainly due to the elimination of duplicate insurance... Among them, the number of people participating in employee basic medical insurance is 362.42 million, a year-on-year increase of 8.11 million. people; the number of people participating in the basic medical insurance for urban and rural residents was 983.28 million, a year-on-year decrease of 25.38 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Urban and Rural Residents Basic Medical Insurance (referred to as &quot;Resident Medical Insurance&quot;) is the merger of the former Urban Residents Basic Medical Insurance and the New Rural Cooperative Medical System to provide integrated and equal medical protection for urban and rural residents. Its operation model is significantly different from that of the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (referred to as &quot;Employee Medical Insurance&quot;). The biggest difference is that the former is voluntary insurance, while the latter is compulsory insurance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Theoretically, because the resident medical insurance is voluntary, you can of course voluntarily withdraw from the insurance or not participate in the insurance, but it is unwise to do so. Because individuals pay a few hundred yuan per year in premiums for residential medical insurance, which is a small part, and government subsidies are the big part. Regardless of men, women, old or young, the advantageous strategy for individuals is to buy it every year and continue to insure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take Shanghai as an example. The individual payment standards for Shanghai residents’ medical insurance are higher than those in other provinces. In 2022, the individual payment for children&#39;s students is 220 yuan, and the financial subsidy is 1,660 yuan, the latter is 7.5 times the former; the individual payment for 15-59 year olds is 860 yuan, and the financial subsidy is 2,750 yuan, the latter is 3.2 times the former; individuals aged 60-69 years old The payment is 690 yuan, and the financial subsidy is 5,940 yuan, the latter is 8.6 times the former; individuals over 70 years old pay 520 yuan, and the financial subsidy is 6,110 yuan, the latter is 11.8 times the former. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an individual, if it is not mandatory to participate in employee medical insurance, would you voluntarily participate in resident medical insurance? Will you choose to cancel the policy after joining? The answer is self-evident. In the final analysis, resident medical insurance is a fundraising model in which individuals contribute a small amount and government financial subsidies contribute a large amount. Of course, going one step further, government revenue or taxes come from taxes paid by workers and businesses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Comparatively speaking, employee medical insurance is compulsory. It is based on an individual&#39;s pre-tax salary. The rate is generally 2% for individuals and 8% for enterprises. In some cities with heavy pension burdens, the enterprise rate is It will be higher. Of course, whether contributions are made in the name of an individual or a company, they are essentially part of the individual’s total salary or the company’s total labor costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The minimum and maximum individual payment bases for employee medical insurance are 60% and 300% of the average salary in the local society. That is to say, for two people, one pays the highest premium and the other pays the lowest premium. The payment of the former It is 5 times that of the latter. However, except for the different personal account balances, the reimbursement ratio for outpatient and hospitalization is the same between the two people, which has nothing to do with the amount of personal payment. This reflects the intra-generational transfer payment attribute of employee medical insurance: a transfer payment from high-income earners to low-income earners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This has led to some effects: For some cost-sensitive &quot;marginal enterprises&quot; in free competition industries, the strategy for employees to participate in employee medical insurance is to only allow &quot;regular employees&quot; to participate, or to reduce employee pre-tax coverage. Salary, because in the eyes of enterprises, the mandatory payment of employee medical insurance has obvious tax implications, so it is natural to avoid it if possible; some people are flexibly employed or freelance, and their wise approach is not to participate in employee medical insurance because &quot;it is too expensive&quot; &quot;, and choose to participate in residents&#39; medical insurance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Let’s compare the medical benefits enjoyed by residents’ medical insurance and employees’ medical insurance. Due to the length of the article, we will skip outpatient treatment here and only compare hospitalization reimbursement ratios. It is not difficult to find that, given the huge difference in personal payment costs between the two, the hospitalization reimbursement ratio for residents’ medical insurance participants is not much lower than that of employee medical insurance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also take Shanghai as an example. The current reimbursement ratio for hospitalization or emergency observation rooms under residents&#39; medical insurance is 80% (level 1)-70% (level 2)-60% (level 3) for infants and students above the self-pay range of 50-300 yuan, 19 Those who are 59 years old are 80% (first level)-75% (second level)-60% (third level), and those who are 60 to 69 years old are 90% (first level)-80% (second level)-70% (third level) , 70% (level one)-60% (level two)-50% (level three) for those over 70 years old, and the hospital level is in brackets. The lower the hospital level, the higher the reimbursement ratio. This encourages insured persons to go to primary hospitals as much as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In comparison, the current employee medical insurance reimbursement ratio for hospitalization or emergency observation rooms is 85% for active employees above the minimum payment standard and below the maximum payment limit, and 80% for above the maximum limit; the reimbursement ratio for retired employees is, Above the minimum payment standard and below the maximum payment limit is 92%, and above the maximum payment limit is 80%. The reimbursement ratio is higher than that of residents’ medical insurance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to see the intergenerational transfer payment attribute of employee medical insurance: the transfer payment between workers, young people and the next generation to retirees, the elderly and the previous generation, or it can be intuitively understood as &quot;all Children support all parents.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, whether it is resident medical insurance or employee medical insurance, although it is called insurance, its operating logic is different from that of general commercial insurance. Commercial insurance will actuarially determine and collect premiums based on the age and health of the insured. People with certain diseases will be denied coverage. Individuals cannot conceal certain diseases before enrolling in insurance, otherwise they may be denied compensation. If you charge a fixed premium every year, it actually means you will charge more when you are young, because the probability of getting sick is low when you are young. The premium collected minus the consumption of the year is the so-called &quot;cash value&quot;. The government medical insurance will not deny coverage because the insured is too old or in poor health, nor will the premium be calculated based on the individual&#39;s age and health status. So, this is a kind of security. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, if your parents are unemployed in the city or live in the countryside, it is a wise choice to urge or buy resident medical insurance for them. On this basis, it is also a good choice to purchase critical illness medical mutual aid supplementary insurance for them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[莫砺锋：“花瓣飘落的方向，是风决定的”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259413]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Doctoral Profile&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot; font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Mo Lizhen, the first doctor of literature in New China. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Born in April 1949 in Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;1963-1966, attended high school in Suzhou Senior High School, Jiangsu Province. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From 1968 to 1977, he worked in farming in Taicang County, Jiangsu Province and Si County, Anhui Province. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;1978-1979, undergraduate student majoring in English in the Department of Foreign Languages, Anhui University. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;1979-1981, Master&#39;s degree student in ancient Chinese literature in the Department of Chinese, Nanjing University, studying under Cheng Qianfan Mr., received a Master of Arts degree. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In 1982, he became a doctoral candidate in ancient literature in the Chinese Department of Nanjing University. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In October 1984, graduated from Nanjing University majoring in ancient Chinese literature.

He is a professor at the School of Liberal Arts of Nanjing University, the director of the Chinese Poetry Research Center of Nanjing University, and the first president of Mei&#39;an Academy.

In 1966, when he graduated from high school, he applied for the engineering major at Tsinghua University. In July of that year, the college entrance examination enrollment was suspended, and the dream of becoming an engineer was shattered in an instant. For the next ten years, he went to the countryside to join the army and spent his bitter youth in the fields. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the college entrance examination was resumed in 1977, his life turned around - he entered the English major of Anhui University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, with the launch of reform and opening up and the resumption of postgraduate education, Mo Lizhen seized the opportunity again. In 1979, the second year after the postgraduate examination was resumed, after studying for three semesters in the English Department of Anhui University, he was admitted to the postgraduate program of the Chinese Department of Nanjing University and embarked on the research path of ancient literature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After retirement, he is still committed to the popularization of Tang and Song poetry, giving lectures and participating in book fairs... He once said that his biggest wish is to stand at the entrance of the &quot;Secret Land of Fairy Mountains&quot; about Tang poetry and Song poetry, giving guidance to tourists.

He quoted the Southern Dynasty philosopher Fan Zhen&#39;s metaphor of &quot;petals falling in the wind&quot; to describe his destiny - &quot;petals on a tree&quot; When it is blown down by the wind, the direction it falls is not determined by the petals, but by the wind.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;There is no other way but to study&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You In previous interviews, you often mentioned your father, and also talked about the scene where &quot;brothers and sisters competed with their father to recite Tang poems.&quot; Did your love for literature sprout from your family environment? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;My father comes from a rural area in Henan Province.

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你报考研究生时才大二，这在当时应该不常见？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;莫砺锋：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;大二考研究生本是不被允许的，但当时比较特殊。我们77级本科生普遍的情况是学生年龄偏大，我班最大的与最小的相差13岁。那时安大外语系的英语专业分7个班，我在7班。 6班是快班，很多同学来自北京、上海，英语基础不错，他们认为自身已具备本科毕业的水平。于是，他们向学校提出提前考研的要求，学校一开始不同意，但他们不停地去磨，最终校方松口说，考虑到你们年纪比较大，再读四年本科，毕业时已三十好几，才决定开这个口子。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们班同学撺掇我跟着6班的同学一起去考研。结果我碰巧考上，于是到南大来读中国古代文学。最有意思的是，我报考时，对南大的古代文学学科一无所知，看到招生简章上的导师是程千帆先生，我压根不知道他是谁。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;从理工科到英语，再到古代文学，在做这些重要选择时，是否有些一以贯之的原则或者理念，你如何看待其中的偶然性和必然性？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;莫砺锋：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;这些都不是我决定的，而是命运决定的，我是顺遂命运者。我最近几年常说，我们就像树上的花瓣，被风一吹就飘下来，事先根本不知道飘到哪里，飘的方向不是花瓣决定的，而是风决定的。我就这样飘到南大。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;偶然性中肯定包含着必然性，但从大环境来说还是偶然性。 1966年如果不爆发“文革”，我要么考不上清华，要考上的话就会去学工科。我当时最大的理想是当工程师，我父亲对我的期望也是如此。可惜在他去世多年以后，我才进入大学。父亲没有看到我成为大学生、研究生以及大学教授，是我一生中最大的遗憾。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;老三届那一代人的命运差不多都是这样，很多事没有办法选择。当年有的同学侥幸被招工，但到城里后进哪个工厂，做什么工种，都只能听从安排。能招上工已经很幸运，我们都羡慕的不得了，毕竟能拿工资，而农民只能挣工分，一天工分的价值只有两三毛钱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，这其中也有主观能动性。我一直没放弃读书，很多同学都放弃了。我在苏州中学有一些同班同学成绩很好，但恢复高考后他们早已结婚成家，有两三个娃，也就不想考了，他们后来很快就下岗，一辈子和大学无缘。这样的人很多，碰到那场“狂风”，一下被吹到泥淖里，再也没有翻身的机会。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你和程千帆先生的师生情谊也被大家称赞，你还记得和程先生第一次见面时的情景吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;莫砺锋：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;第一次见到程先生时，他66岁，头发已经花白。他对我们说的第一句话是：“有很多考生考前来找我，到家里来见我，有的还带着礼物，只有你们3个人（莫砺锋和师兄徐有富以及师弟张三夕）连封信也没写过，这样很好！”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;1979年你入学时学位条例还没有正式颁布，直到1981年国务院批准《学位条例暂行实施办法》，学位制度才正式建立。那时读博算不算冒险？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;莫砺锋：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;在1979年9月的开学典礼上，匡亚明校长说学位条例正在制定。他是国务院学位委员会的委员，参与这项工作。我们入学时不分硕士、博士，统称研究生。匡亚明校长说，你们以后会是第一批硕士和博士。两年后我们毕业，学位条例颁布了，我拿到硕士学位，后来又跟着程先生继续读博。我觉得读博是件好事，也完全没有“冒险”的感觉。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;在真正开始读博前，你对于博士生活的预期是怎样的？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;莫砺锋：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;也没有具体的预期，谁知道博士生涯是怎样的。我只是觉得读硕都那么辛苦、紧张，读博肯定只会更加紧张，所以心里做好了坐几年冷板凳的准备。反正我年轻时吃过不少苦，“曾经沧海难为水”，读博肯定不会比种地更辛苦。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;那时我们还没有自主培养的博士，作为第一批文学博士的你们是怎么读博的，如何上课和撰写博士论文？据说你刚开始读博时，程先生也不知道博士论文要写到什么程度。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;莫砺锋：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;确是如此，因为博士在中国属于新生事物。当时没有完整的课程体系，培养模式也是暗中摸索的。程先生也不知道博士论文要写到什么程度，他从学校图书馆里借来一堆国外已出版的博士论文，还有不少港台高校的博士论文，读了好几本，才心中有数。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;程先生的培养方式来自哪里，是如何形成的？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;莫砺锋：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我觉得是他自己揣摩的，当然也可能是从国外或港台的博士论文的学术水准上推导出来的。由于当时全系只有我一个博士生，所以程先生没有为我在课堂开课，除了外语，我的课程学习完全采取专书阅读的方式，也就是自己读书，遇到难点去先生家请教。程先生规定我攻读8部典籍：《诗经》《楚辞》《论语、孟子》《老子、庄子》《左传》《史记》《文选》《文心雕龙》。每部书都要交读书报告，其中有4篇报告后来作为学术论文公开发表。那种培养模式有点像旧时的手艺人带学徒，师傅手把手地教，学徒边干活边学习。对于中国古代文学这样的学科，那种方式是相当有效的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;1978年恢复研究生教育时，当年录取了1万人。如今，在读博士约为56万人。许多博士生不免担忧就业前景，对未来迷茫，文科博士更甚。你博士毕业时也会迷茫吗，以及如何看待他们当下的担忧和迷茫？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;莫砺锋：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我1984年博士毕业时，分配工作，可以挑很多单位，最后我选择留在南大。那时国家培养的硕博人数少，客观上没有就业压力，这点跟现在很多文科博士的处境不一样。我很理解现在的同学们，现在博士生人数多，而岗位少。经过多年大规模研究生扩招，大部分单位都不缺人，所以就业越来越难。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is entirely a problem of the times, not a personal problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我的学生找工作也难。 If I can&#39;t find a job, the pressure will extend to me.

What is your original intention in choosing to study these &quot;masters&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In fact, all academic research is about reversing the case, and the same is true for science and engineering. When I was studying for a PhD at NTU, the school recruited 10 doctoral students in the first batch, each from a different department.我们宿舍住3个人，一个化学系，一个计算机系，我跟他们交流，发现他们做研究，找题目写论文，跟我们一模一样，都是在前人成果的夹缝里面求生活，在很细小的方向上追求一些创新，补充或推翻前人的研究结果。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But for the subject of ancient literature, what can truly represent the academic achievements of an era should be &quot;everyone&#39;s&quot; research. Whether there is an overall breakthrough in the research of an era depends on how well &quot;everyone&quot; studies. &quot;Xiaojia&quot; research only fills the gap and cannot become a symbol of the academic level of an era. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你最喜欢的两位诗人是杜甫和苏轼，甚至曾说愿意穿越到宋朝去黄州帮苏轼种地，你认为在研究杜甫和苏轼的过程中，他们带给你最大的体悟是什么？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This may be related to Mr. Cheng’s proposition that “literary research should focus on feelings and words”. I started reading Du Fu and Su Shi before I entered college. The only motivation at that time was that I liked them. I felt warm and comforted when I read them.我多次说过，当我在那座被狂风刮破屋顶的茅屋里过夜，眼看着满天繁星而冻得瑟瑟发抖的时候，杜甫的《茅屋为秋风所破歌》给我带来心灵的震撼。我种过十年地，我觉得自己当个农民并不算屈才。但我真心不愿意让苏东坡也在黄州开荒种地，他那样德才兼备的杰出人物有更重要的事情要做！ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杜、苏二人给我带来的最大体悟就是“安得广厦千万间”的人间情怀，和“一蓑烟雨任平生”的人生态度，我愿意尽我可能来宣扬他们。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你在“大家”研究中是如何做到创新的？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;莫砺锋：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;真正的创新很难，我哪能做到。因为创新要求你比别人看得更深或更远，我没有那么高的水平。此外创新也需要偶然的机会，正好出现很好的新题目，或者很珍贵的新材料，这都是可遇不可求的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我只能尽量不人云亦云，不炒冷饭。我现在普及工作做得较多，讲一些常识性的内容，但如何将常识性内容讲得准确，要求也很高，这和学术的严谨性应该是统一的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;注意到从走进《百家讲坛》之后，你就一直致力于古典诗词的普及工作，开始做普及工作有什么契机？你曾说最大的心愿是做在唐诗宋词“仙山秘境”入口处的导游，这个愿望现在实现了吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;莫砺锋：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我上《百家讲坛》也是偶然。南大百年校庆时，邀请央视的编导来录节目，录完后在《百家讲坛》播出，效果还不错，后来他们就来找我讲唐诗。节目播出后，很多观众来信，反响热烈，我感觉普及工作蛮有意义。 &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我现在最想达到的目的，是让普通读者和我一样喜欢唐诗宋词，喜欢杜甫和苏东坡。所谓普及，就是走出学校的小教室，走向社会的大教堂。让我欣慰的是，我开讲座时的听众里各个年龄层次各种身份的人都有，我真的走到社会大众中间，也算实现了自己的愿望。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;那你认为古代文学的学术研究和普及工作在当下是否面临一些困境？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;莫砺锋：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;现在的研究有概念化、碎片化的趋势，普及工作则有庸俗化的趋势。前者比如一定要强行发掘某些古典诗词中的现代性，实际上可能没有。如果生搬硬套一些新名词来贴标签，结论就不符合历史真相。还有一些学者选题过于细碎，意义不大。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;普及工作则有庸俗化的趋势。为了吸引观众，切合年轻人的口味，有不少戏说、曲解，而且把古人完整的意境弄得碎片化，缺乏整体感。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;有什么解决方法吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;莫砺锋：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;这个问题难以避免，走向大众，必然会带来不同的口味和要求。我只能要求自己尽量做好。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;对当下的年轻人，特别是大学生和研究生群体有什么人生建议吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;莫砺锋：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我今年6月应邀到安徽大学参加毕业典礼并致辞。我40年前离开安大时没有获得毕业证书，如今以“杰出校友”的身份参加典礼，心中感慨万分。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我在典礼上引用东坡的《定风波》来勉励学弟学妹们学习东坡的人生精神，来迎接自己的风雨人生。因为我们普通人的人生必然是充满风雨的，我们不能幻想走上一帆风顺的人生道路，所以一定要做好充分的思想准备。请让我引用在安大的致辞中的几句话来送给其他高校的大学生和研究生群体：“我衷心祝愿同学们像东坡那样始终以&#39;自强不息&#39;的积极态度来对待人生，有所作为。我也衷心希望同学们遇到人生坎坷时以&#39;一蓑烟雨任平生&#39;的格言自我勉励，从容应对！”&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;在如今鱼龙混杂的演艺圈，的确鲜有人像李健这样讨喜的歌手。我们很少听到乐评人对他的批评之声，也没见微博的各类营销号抖他的什么黑料，他就是红了，红得那么理所当然，红得那么众望所归。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/huSjlbT3I3FOoTHypGp5yeS64ovaHlSp8XRIbh88.jpeg&quot;

&lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;出世：&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;知识分子的气质&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;李健具有这样的底气。清华大学电子工程专业毕业，与许多歌手“寒碜”的学历或文化素养相比，李健是一览众山小，“清华高材生”本就是一个令人羡慕之极的身份，又不同于我们对理工男邋遢、不修边幅、长相平凡的印象。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;更关键的是，李健身上那种知识分子的气质。李健的家中整整齐齐堆满了唱片和书，他听的唱片是Leonard Cohen、The Beatles、Freshly ground、Michael Buble、Fabio Zanon，看的书是博尔赫斯、茨威格、劳伦斯·布洛克、乔治·奥威尔，最后他拿出来的是Leonard Cohen的传记《我是你的男人》。他有着知识分子的那种清醒、自持，他与物欲横流的世界自觉保持着一定的距离，并在精神世界上追求精进。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而从他的选歌，也可以看出他的这种独立气质，有人说他是“音乐诗人”，其实他凸显更多的是“音乐傲骨”。比如线上演唱会，10首私藏翻唱，14首原创作品，诠释他心中对于海和诗的感悟。李健总是在浅吟低唱，他不秀技巧，不飙高音，旋律轻柔绮丽，唱腔空灵婉转。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是李健出世的一面——他并不孜孜追求外在的功名和财富，有的是作为一个独立个体的追求、傲气和坚持。纸醉金迷的娱乐圈，他没有迷失自己。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/eAAaCHmRWWJ7NoJc5uuf8J6QNxhWB6R48hPNeYUt.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;660&quot; height=&quot;440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/eAAaCHmRWWJ7NoJc5uuf8J6QNxhWB6R48hPNeYUt.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255636&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;入世：希望刚毕业的&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;一帆风顺&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;如果这是李健的全部模样，或许他也很难这么讨喜。毕竟音乐圈里高冷的创作歌手不少——比如梁博，一首《灵魂歌手》惊为天人，他的人气和受众基础却远不如李健，其他小众歌手更不必提了。李健的独特之处在于，他又有着入世的一面。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李健尽管不耽于物质，他却能够把自己的生活过得很好。他健身，旅行，懂咖啡，家里有专门的茶室，收集唱片……每一次出现在镜头前，他的穿着打扮总是给人熨帖舒适之感。李健的生活，有着一种高冷的格调，他不是满大街随处可见的大众品牌，他是Fendi、LV和Hermes。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在一些访谈中你可以看出，李健对社会发展中出现的一些问题有所关切。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比如因“希望大家少经受挫折磨难”的话题登上了微博热搜，他不久前在音乐会上对年轻人说：“我希望所有的人能够生活得简单轻松，不需要付出很大的努力就可以过上很好的生活，尤其是那些刚刚毕业的朋友，少经受挫折和磨难，不经受挫折和磨难更好，希望你们一帆风顺。”对于困境，他不愤世嫉俗，不声嘶力竭，而是祝福与前行。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就如同他的选歌，他始终在吟唱着爱情、故乡、童年、月光、星辰、年华等美好的事物，他不直接批判庸俗，但他吟咏美好的事物曲折地达到这个目的。你也许会说李健很“保守”，但他却非常安全。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;何况，李健还是一个接地气的“耿直boy+高萌的段子手+可爱的吃货”，轻描淡写就能够把许多严肃的、刻板的话语方式消解掉，让人会心一笑，并察觉到他的可爱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总之，在李健身上，出世和入世是如此完美地组合在一起。很多人只能做到一点，或者连一点都做不好，或者在二者之间撕扯纠缠，李健完美地拥有了二者，他是很多人的人格理想。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;无怪乎不少评论说，李健是中产的灵魂抚慰者。李健的歌迷虽然囊括了各个群体，但诚如媒体人朱伟所说，喜欢李健的人主要是“文青”“小资”“受过良好教育且感情细腻的群体”。这些人都是属于中产阶层或者预备中产阶层。如果说中国中产阶层有什么显著的特点，在出世入世之间“撕扯”便是其一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中产们既有入世的一面，他们追求物质，追求格调，安分守己，保守中庸，渴望岁月静好、现世安稳的生活；可遗憾的是，为了这岁月静好，他们又得奔走在大都市的钢筋水泥森林，疲于应付职场中的快节奏与复杂人际，承受巨大的生活压力与精神压力，稳定安逸的生活似乎触不可及。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;于是他们又有出世的一面，他们很想逃离这一切，不去理会什么房子、车子、孩子、职场，想辟出一块属于自己的精神家园，屏蔽外界的一切纷纷扰扰；但真的要放下这一切，他们又会有所眷恋，有所不甘。中产的撕扯是因为他们无论是出世或入世，均不可得。于是他们时常在二者之间彷徨犹豫，左手是马云，右手是星云。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李健完美出世又完美入世，他活成了许多中产想活成的模样，他就这样成了中产的抚慰者。这样说绝不是贬低李健，李健无意于扮演这样的角色，他只是刚好踩到了时代的节点上——这个时代的中产阶层真是太累了。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;h4>;所谓“祖源分析”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;人类遗传主要分为父系、母系、常染色体三个部分。其中父系溯源比较直观，就是查Y染色体，因为其只能从父亲传给儿子；而母系溯源的原理也差不多，就是查线粒体基因。无论男女，线粒体都只能从母亲那里获得。但Y染色体和线粒体，都只占人类基因非常小的一部分。而父母各给一半的常染色体，则占比超过98%，可以说常染色体真正决定了你是谁。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;各种商业检测所谓的“祖源分析”，也基本都把常染色体作为最大卖点。如果不了解原理，可能就会被误导——所谓的祖源分析，其实是先把全世界各地的主要人群，都抽样测一下存档。然后再用你的检测结果，去和档案里已有的数据比对，看看和哪些人群最接近。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以如果你测出来了“40%的南方汉族，50%的北方汉族，10%的蒙古族”，这并不表示你的100位祖宗里，有40个南方人，50个北方人，10个蒙古人——这个检测结果仅仅表示，你和该公司的北方汉族样本最接近，其次是南方汉族样本，最后是蒙古族样本。把这3个样本按以上比例混合得到的常染色体数据，和你的检测结果接近，仅此而已。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而我们都知道，东亚大陆没有种姓内婚制，南北人群的基因肯定是渐变的。加上各机构取样不同，结果就是同一个人在不同公司往往会测出不同结果：比如有的机构取山西汉族为“北方汉族样本”，于是山西汉族去测，就会测出来“100%北方汉族”；而有的公司以华北汉族为北方样本，山西汉族去测，又可能测出来“蒙古血统”了......&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以从本质上来说，这不是“祖源分析”，而是“亲戚分析”。但你和某个人群接近，就必定有共同祖先，所以虽然是商业噱头，但也不算凭空捏造，还是有其科学依据的。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;满族基因与汉族无异&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“我从哪里来”是全世界人类都感兴趣的哲学问题，基因检测这么火也是自然之中了。为了吸引顾客，各大基因公司也纷纷完善样本数据库，希望能给所有族群都筛选出没有争议的比对样本——然而这个宏大计划，却在满族基因上碰了一鼻子灰。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为一个人口上千万的民族，各大机构对满族反复取样计算，却发现始终无法得到满族的标杆样本。无论怎么扩大样本量，改善分析方法，即使对满族的抽样人数已经达到数千人，却依然是一个结论：满族无论父系、母系、常染色体，都与汉族没有区别。如果用已有标杆样本进行分析，那么现代满族群体的民族血统，以北方汉（80%）、南方汉（6.57%）、日韩（5%）、蒙古-通古斯（3%）等成分为主。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这样的结果，让很多学者和人类学爱好者都很惊讶：其他通古斯语人群，比如鄂伦春族，和汉族的基因差异是非常明显的。满族在遗传上却和汉族几乎一致，要知道清朝是严禁满汉（旗民）通婚的，那么满族作为通古斯语系的一员，到底是怎么变成汉人血统的？&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;掠奴传统&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;一个可能的解释是，这和满洲（女真）社会的掠奴传统有关。满洲入关前后还处在奴隶社会，每次出征都必定大量掠夺平民作为奴隶，满语称为“阿哈”，如果是家生奴隶就叫“包衣阿哈”。比如明朝成化三年，明军深入打击建州女真，一次战役就解救了1165名沦为女真奴隶的汉人。而随着建州女真的不断崛起，掠奴的规模也越来越大，动辄以万计。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后金/清对明朝掠奴的人数规模，目前国内没有研究。但同时期清朝也对明朝属国“李氏朝鲜”多次用兵，根据史料记载，1636年丙子战争，清军将60万朝鲜官民男女掠为奴隶，押回沈阳市场贩卖（这个数字还不包括清军中的蒙古士兵掠往蒙古的朝鲜人口数）。现代学者大多认为60万有所夸大，实际数量大概在40万-50万。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而在整个明清易代战争中，清军掳掠的汉人恐怕更难以计数了。比如1698年来华的法国传教士巴多明，就在写给法国科学院的信中提到：“年老的鞑靼人在关内渐渐死去，他们的子女更容易学习被征服地的语言而不是父辈的语言，因为他们的母亲和仆人几乎全是汉人”——可见清初的满洲家庭，女眷和仆人都源自掳掠来的汉人奴隶。这样几代之后，其母系和常染色体遗传，必定都会变得和汉人无异，母语也会自然替换成汉语。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;清代战争制度与抱养继嗣&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;然而现代满族的父系遗传，也和汉族相差无几，这就不能只用清军掠夺汉女来解释了。有一种观点推测，这可能和清代独特的战争制度导致的旗人家庭抱养继嗣成风有关：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很多历史爱好者都注意到，明代调兵动辄数万数十万，比如万历年间的播州之役，三省各出兵8万，合计24万明军。而清代却只能一次调动数千士兵，最多也不过一两万人。比如乾隆年间的某场边境战争，开战初期居然只派出3000八旗兵和100名侍卫巴图鲁。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因为清军必须首先防范汉地起义，因此绿营极度碎片化，分散在全国各地。然后在各个关键城市设立满城，调入八旗驻防。通过相对集中的八旗，去监视绿营。如果某个地方出现了民变，可以第一时间出兵弹压。把起义消灭在萌芽状态，同时防止汉人构成的绿营坐大。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是这种碎片化的军制，一旦碰到外敌入侵，或是需要组织军队对外进攻，就很难凑出一支规模庞大的军队了。先不说调兵需要极长的时间，为了保证对内的镇压力度，只能抽调小部分兵员。即使花了大力气凑出了一支稍具规模的，这支军队也是各种支离破碎的小部队集合体，缺乏组织度，难以用于打大规模会战。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;顺治五年编审完成的丁册记载，八旗壮丁共计34.7万人，其中满洲5.5万人，蒙古2.9万人，汉军4.6万人。而满、蒙古旗下家奴汉人21.7万人，占比达62.5%。满蒙汉八旗，共计13万壮丁，是战斗兵的主力。这些清军一半在北京，一半分散各地满城驻防。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此清初八旗每次出兵，抽调1万人都是大兵团了。这样的结果是，满洲士兵在各种战争中被快速消耗，而汉人家奴不参军打仗，即使随军也以承担辅助和后勤工作为主。这部分人口在清初一系列战争中，受到的人口损失应该是最小的。而且家奴算是八旗的私产，如果折损了，旗人还会想办法“补充”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;等到雍正年间，清朝在和通泊战役中仅仅损失7000八旗兵，就把京城旗人打得家家披麻戴孝。接下来乾隆又号称“十全武功”，战争愈加频繁，八旗人口的损失来不及通过自然生育填补。很多旗人家庭男丁战死后又亲族凋零，只能偷偷从汉人家奴里抱养孩童为养子以充门户，避免家门绝断，一家女眷无人赡养。民间一直有传说，乾隆抱养自海宁陈氏，其故事原型可能就来源于此。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;

She usually has the habit of hoarding garbage. When she encounters cans, mineral water bottles, cartons Cardboard boxes, scrap wires, and even scraps from the village mosquito net factory were all picked up and taken home. She didn’t see much of them sold, so they were all piled up in the yard. My sister and I spend a long time cleaning up every time. Before long, she picks up so many things that they pile up like a mountain, and the small yard is like a garbage dump. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only that, my mother also has a lot of old things stored in her two rooms, including clothes, shoes and hats from many years ago, rusty iron pots, shovels, farm tools, and even old things that her father brought to her from Xinjiang when he was still alive. The cotton felts, blankets, and sheepskin jackets were in tatters and a mess. We have to clean her out, and mother protects her like a baby, for fear that we will throw her away as garbage when she is not paying attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In some villages and towns, old people with my mother’s habits are quite common. Some store less and put them in categories; some store more and put them in disorder; some garbage is mixed with daily necessities and they simply eat and sleep in the garbage pile. It is understood that this is mostly done by lonely elderly people. Very little of the garbage they pick up can be sold. Since they are unable to move it out, they have to coexist with the garbage over time. There are also elderly people who have children and also like to hoard rags. Their behavior and habits are often disgusted by their children, and they are even ridiculed as &quot;nostalgia mania&quot; and &quot;crazy&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why do these elderly people like to hoard &quot;rags&quot;? Investigating the reasons, I found through investigation that they are nothing more than the following:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, it is based on frugality and cannot bear to throw away old things. The elderly are used to living a hard life, and they can make do with the old things at home, and seldom buy new clothes or new supplies. Even if their children buy them, they are often not used to them. They still think the old ones are better and are reluctant to throw them away. Some old people do not want to sell the rags they pick up for money, but feel it would be a pity to throw them away. Old man Wang in his hometown village likes to collect old furniture discarded by young people. It is often seen that he uses a tricycle to transport it home. Someone asked him: &quot;You have saved so much, can you use it yourself?&quot; Old Man Wang said: &quot;They are all high-quality wood. Where can I find this before! I can dismantle it and it can be used.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;The second reason is based on nostalgia. There is warmth and emotion in the rags. Many elderly people are nostalgic for old things. Many of their clothing items have been with them for decades. Old things have memories, stories and feelings. In my family, my mother has a deep affection for the rags that have been piled up in two rooms, especially my father’s belongings. She left some of them when he was buried. Every time he wanted to dispose of them, my mother always said: “You throw them away as garbage.” &quot;Where can I miss your dad? I took out these things, rubbed them, and talked about them, as if talking to him...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third is based on loneliness, to relieve loneliness. This situation is more common among the elderly who like to hoard rags. According to my mother, Aunt Zhang&#39;s three children all work in developed areas and earn a lot of money. They send her money on time every month. It should be said that Aunt Zhang has no worries about food and clothing. But she got up early and stayed up late at night, rain or shine, picking up trash everywhere. Aunt Zhang explained the reason: &quot;My children all know how to be filial, and I don&#39;t lack anything. But they rarely come back throughout the year, and I feel empty. I don&#39;t pick up rags all for the sake of selling them, but I just have something to do and feel at ease.&quot; ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fourth is based on being noticed and longing for short-term happiness. When my friend was chatting with me, he mentioned that his relative, Grandma Li, who lives in the city, had a unique reason for picking up garbage. Her old courtyard is rarely visited by people, and only during holidays and New Years are the children and grandchildren reunited. The small courtyard is filled with laughter and joy. Those are the happiest and happiest days of the year for Granny Li. Later, Granny Li discovered that whenever the house was messy, her children would come to clean it, so she had an idea and deliberately picked up garbage and made the yard messy and dirty, so that the children would come back to clean it up, which made the house more popular and lively. , it’s lively. The two daughters-in-law couldn&#39;t stand her behavior and said that Granny Li was a little mentally disturbed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The elderly are keen to hoard rags and rags, which is not only unsightly and affects the sanitation of the family environment, but more importantly, the elderly have more or less problems with their mental health. As a child, you should not only clean up regularly, persuade and comfort them, and return them to a normal life track, but you should also look for the reasons at a deeper level. As the saying goes: To untie a bell, you must tie the bell. Children should not only pay attention to material support, but also pay attention to spiritual support. Just like the old song &quot;Go Home Often and See&quot; sings, &quot;Find some free time, find some time, take your children, and come home often; Bring a smile, bring blessings, accompany your loved ones, and go home often...&quot; Give the elderly more spiritual comfort and let them feel the deep family affection and the warmth of home. To a certain extent, this is richer than simply giving them Material support is more important! &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a staff member of the Standing Committee of the People&#39;s Congress of Tancheng County, Shandong Province)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The &quot;Hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of Southern Weekend App is looking forward to your contributions .

He entered the industry late and had 50 jobs before becoming an actor. work. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of tvbs)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Kangren&#39;s voice came from the other end of the receiver. Like an old-fashioned man, he carefully confirmed the name of the newspaper and the reporter&#39;s name, and his tone sounded gentle and gentle. He is on vacation. When he is not working, he spends his time in the same way as ordinary people. He passes the time by watching anime such as &quot;Spells Come Back&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years, Wu Kangren may have been the actor with the broadest role map in the Chinese-language drama market. His images in movies and TV shows are so varied that it&#39;s jaw-dropping. In 2021, he dressed up in women&#39;s clothing, put on lipstick, and played the role of Mama Sang &quot;Baby&quot; in the highly acclaimed drama &quot;The Lights Are Coming&quot;. The character photo was published in Taiwanese newspapers, but no one reacted, &quot;It took two days to be discovered by others. Isn&#39;t this Wu Kangren!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 2022 drama &quot;Her and Her Her&quot;, he plays A pervert who is sexually harassed in the workplace has a female fan who is so angry that she wants to &quot;quit her fans&quot;. Wu Kangren is very calm about this. He told Southern Weekend reporters that he is not worried about the loss of fans of the drama and movies. &quot;The next role will be different.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These roles are a huge departure from the &quot;flower boy&quot; image he played early in his career. At the age of 27, he played Hana Takuya in the classic idol drama &quot;Next Stop, Happiness&quot; - affectionate, broken, and in line with all the settings of a tragic male lead. But in the following years, he continued to break away from that image full of romantic arcs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, on the 54th Taiwan Golden Bell Awards stage, Wu Kangren took the stage as the award guest. Everyone looked at the thin actor with sunken cheeks and a bald head with some suspicion. &quot;Isn&#39;t this a bald man?&quot; A barrage floated across the video. At that time, for the new drama, he lost weight to only 64 kilograms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It has become routine for him to adjust his body shape, skin color and accent according to the requirements of the role. Someone made an Excel polyline table of Wu Kangren&#39;s weight data from &quot;Termites&quot; to &quot;Love&quot; and found that his weight suddenly went up and down, showing a steep W shape. A reporter from Southern Weekend asked him if he was not afraid of physical damage caused by drastic changes? He smiled and replied: &quot;I&#39;m still alive.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Fight&quot; is the key word that many people first think of when they mention Wu Kangren. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2023, Wu Kangren changed his appearance again in the Taiwanese drama &quot;In This Lifetime&quot; broadcast exclusively on Station B. He put on a Hawaiian shirt, revealing his dark skin, and became the 41-year-old frustrated middle-aged Gao Jiayue. As the eldest son in his family, he has been drifting away for a long time, running a restaurant named &quot;One Million&quot; with a rating of only 2.8 in Xiaoliuqiu. After several years of bleak business, his girlfriend couldn&#39;t bear the island life and cheated on him and left. His career went bankrupt, his love failed, and he tried to hang himself in a restaurant, but the rope broke. Dive to the bottom of the sea, take off your oxygen equipment, and prepare to drown yourself. He suddenly remembered that the oxygen equipment might be eaten by sea turtles and was not environmentally friendly, so he had no choice but to surface and returned home dejectedly to meet his family and have a &quot;long farewell.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My parents ran a breakfast shop in Taipei to support their three sons. The mother struggled to endure her father&#39;s mental infidelity and continued to live under the same roof with resentment. The second son is an adopted son. He lives a regular life as an office worker and takes the initiative to take over the responsibility of taking care of his parents. The younger son is older and unmarried, and helps in the breakfast shop. The whole family is stuck in the inertia of the old life and is stuck in moving forward. Everyone is in a &quot;stuck moment&quot; in life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Kangren said that he doesn’t have much in common with the character, but as a peer of Gao Jiayue, he has also experienced Kaka moments in real life. &quot;What&#39;s the hardest time for an actor? The role you want to take is taken away, or people don&#39;t like your good performance when it comes out.&quot; Wu Kangren told a reporter from Southern Weekend. His response was simple and clear: keep eating, sleeping, and trying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023 will be a harvest year for Wu Kangren. Two of his films, &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; and &quot;May You Live Forever&quot; were screened at the film festival. Both films focused on the bottom class. &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; was filmed in Malaysia, with Wu Kangren playing a deaf-mute illegal immigrant. After getting off the plane, he intuitively felt the gap between him and the character. At first glance, he was a &quot;white and clean civilized person&quot;, while the character he played lived in a dirty place all day long. He began to starve and continued to bask in the sun until his skin was tanned by ultraviolet rays and the locals in the market stopped looking at him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the 2023 First Youth Film Festival, he won the best actor for this role. The organizing committee commented on his performance: &quot;Faced with unconventional character settings, Wu Kangren used all available physical resources such as expressions, body parts, movements, and eyes to perform, interpreting the emotions and emotions of the film extremely vividly. Hearing thunder in silence reflects the actor&#39;s great empathy for the character&#39;s situation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Kangren has a rare sense of relaxation. He has no agent or company and works for himself. Lasted nine years. There are no personal restrictions or team control. It&#39;s all up to you to decide what kind of scenes to take on, what roles to play, how much to talk to the media, and what the standards are. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He asked a Southern Weekend reporter which episode of &quot;In This Lifetime&quot; he had watched. After getting the answer, he conveyed his preferences as if he were a friend: &quot;Look further down, the back is really better. I really like it.&quot; I like it.&quot; Faced with the reporter&#39;s &quot;problematic&quot; question, he also bluntly said: &quot;This question is too broad.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the outside world, the different types of roles over the years have brought Wu Kangren Emboldened. But he said that when he was young, his sense of self-identity was very low and he felt that he was just a &quot;nobody&quot;. He entered the industry late and had 50 jobs before the age of 20. He worked as a rough laborer on construction sites, ran a street stall, and also worked in cafes and bars. Now that I am in my forties this year, the feeling of insecurity has subsided, and new questions have arisen in my heart. He said that in recent years, he feels that his life as an actor will not be too long, so he cherishes it more and increases the frequency of taking roles. This year, he has at least seven film and television works released. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the interview, he almost subconsciously revealed his expectations for his subsequent career. He said: &quot;I want to continue acting until I am old.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http: //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/iNugJUjNXgJjxodcmTCYsmf9VQCWG6XI7zrO9Neb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;519&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/iNugJUjNXgJjxodcmTCYsmf9VQCWG6XI7zrO9Neb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255555&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In &quot; In &quot;In This Lifetime&quot;, Wu Kangren plays Gao Jiayue, a frustrated middle-aged man. After his career went bankrupt and his love failed, he tried to commit suicide but failed and returned home in despair. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of tvbs)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In early October 2023, Wu Kangren accepted an exclusive interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend. The following is a self-narration compiled based on the interview content:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;It would be good to grow this big in my lifetime&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After receiving the invitation from &quot;In This Lifetime&quot; At that time, I had just finished filming the movie &quot;May You Live Longer&quot; in Hong Kong. When I finished filming, I only weighed 53 kilograms, which was too light. So before joining the set of &quot;In This Life Time&quot;, I ate as much as possible and weighed 66 kilograms when I returned. Last year I went to Malaysia and Hong Kong to shoot a movie respectively. I was made thin and dark. I came back to play the role of Gao Jiayue, a kid who came back from the island. In fact, he looked quite similar. In addition, director Xu Zhaoren is here, and I also like the script. I knew beforehand that Brother Xixiang (Xi Xiang, who plays the father) and Sister Guimei (Yang Guimei, who plays the mother) would take the role, so I also wanted to act together in it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The director took the sad story very lightly, and made the sad things somewhat funny, even humorous. Gao Jiayue is a person who really wants to die. But if you take what Gao Jiayue said to his nephew, &quot;I jumped into the sea, I wanted to die, but I saw turtles again, and I was afraid that the turtles would eat my equipment and it was not environmentally friendly.&quot; People say that he must think you are lying or joking. But when the audience actually saw the picture, all this became no longer such a joke: it was true, he wanted to die. I think this is where life is ridiculous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In My Lifetime&quot; is not about university knowledge. My own interpretation is, &quot;It would be good to grow this big in your lifetime.&quot; This sentence reflects a lot of feelings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When things don’t go as planned, it’s always a “stuck moment.” In our lives, sometimes things go against our expectations, and sometimes hard work may not necessarily pay off. This is a very cruel thing. You can’t get what you want, and you can get what you don’t want. How you can stabilize your mood, continue to live, continue to love the people around you, or make the people you love live happily is all a matter of subject. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people choose to escape, such as the parents in the play who have marital problems. Gao Jiayue came back to tell them not to continue evading. Some people tried to persuade them to make peace but not to leave. Gao Jiayue tried to persuade them to leave but not to make peace. Some people are always in his comfort zone, such as his two younger brothers, who complain about life but are unwilling to step out. How can a character like Gao Jiayue push them, but in such an annoying way? He has the courage to be hated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Real-life family dramas are not as easy as genre dramas. It is very difficult to act in a very real-life way. We actors have been acting for so long and are very familiar with rhythm, technique, and movement. We are also very familiar with how to perform well on camera. But when we try too hard to show the good side, the sense of drama will be stronger and the audience can see it. Xu Zhaoren hopes to adapt it to life, so we revised the lines in the direction of life. Chatting with the director and imagining the characters every day before going on stage is actually very brain-burning and tiring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The script of &quot;In This Lifetime&quot; is very well structured, and the relationship between everyone is clearly written. But we didn’t act according to the relationship between everyone in the script. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We feel that we have put a lot of effort into it. In fact, at that time, I was so thin that I deliberately imitated Brother Xixiang. Since I wanted to play his son, did I have any similarities with him? We looked at his posture and sometimes imitated him in jumping and sitting. At that time, I had a lot of discussions with the director. Since you want to play a son and a brother, do you have the same attitude towards each family member, or is it a little different? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, when you are getting along with your younger brother, you just love to bully him. How to bully him? The screenwriter will not teach you to hit them with your hands in the play. This kind of action must be designed by yourself. And it has to be connected to when you were a kid. The second brother in the play is not your biological brother. Your attitude towards your biological brother (reporter&#39;s note: third brother) may be different from that of the second brother. In fact, it is very subtle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, the relationship with his father was not good in the script, but in fact when we acted it out, Brother Xixiang felt that he loved his eldest son the most because he was his first son. Child. It is a very straightforward way for parents to express their love for you verbally. Brother Xixiang’s method is the kind of love in which he scolds you the harshest and hits you the hardest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The original way of quarreling with my father was to talk to each other, but now as the show continues, it has become that I can actually have a good chat with my father. You are a rebellious son, but you are always unwilling to take what adults say seriously, which means we are acting the other way around. So in the first episode at the beginning, the father guarded the drunk Gao Jiayue from getting up, saying that he was afraid that you would spit it out and choke to death. Therefore, the relationship between Gao Jiayue and his father was not a quarrel at the beginning, but a show of weakness, that is, I was homesick and came back to see it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the script, there is no drinking in the scene of returning home. We discussed with the director and couldn&#39;t imagine what kind of state Gao Jiayue was in before he dared to step into this home again. A failed person, a person who is unwilling to start over, a person who dares not face himself again, but is so arrogant and thinks that I will succeed when I go out to start a business, and then returns to this home penniless, at this time, what should I do? How to do it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So what I thought of was, otherwise we would have a drink, and he would have to get himself drunk before he dared to return to this house shamelessly. In the end we decided to use this method. How on earth would he face the truth? You can only get yourself drunk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In that scene, I really drank sorghum wine. I&#39;m not that good at drinking, but I drank in a situation that I could control. After filming, I fell asleep, and the actors called it a day, leaving me alone on set. When I woke up, the only thing left was the lighting crew taking out the lights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/3ijT0Y9zockqo3BFBZxZtn4NO0EUMTVl8Cf8Zc2C.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;519&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/3ijT0Y9zockqo3BFBZxZtn4NO0EUMTVl8Cf8Zc2C.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255556&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In recent years, Wu Kangren&#39;s film and television image has been very varied, and he has played many impressive supporting roles. In 2023, he will have at least seven film and television works released. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of tvbs)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;At that time, I only wanted to take supporting roles&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>;In recent years, Taiwanese dramas have become more varied in genre. Since they are so varied, of course actors have the opportunity to be varied. They just complement each other, from early idol dramas to later craftsman dramas, police and gangster movies, ghost movies, and now back to life. It&#39;s a big test for actors. You can&#39;t use your past skills to perform every play. When you encounter different plays, you have to make different adjustments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have no particular pursuit to play various types of characters, I just want to accumulate different acting experiences. It should be said that I think the life of an actor will not be too long. I dare not say that for everyone. I think it is a question mark in my mind how long an actor can act. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was in my early 30s, I began to realize this, which may have something to do with my upbringing. In the past, my self-identity was not so high. The so-called self-identity refers to self-confidence and even the value of existence. You may feel that you are just a nobody, a child who grew up on a construction site. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was young, I really felt that I could only work hard, otherwise what would I do? That’s why I got so many roles later. The reason I take on so many roles is not because I want to make a lot of money. In Taiwan, I can’t make much money from film remuneration. I hope that within a limited time, I can see my own possibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So after I turned 35, I started to play different roles quite quickly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;She and Her Her&quot;, &quot;The Lights Come on&quot; and &quot;Mom, stop making trouble!&quot; ” were probably all filmed at the same time, and during that time I only wanted to take on supporting roles. Because I think the burden of the protagonist is too heavy. The protagonist sometimes shoots for three or four months at a time. He is always immersed in a role or a long period of work. He is very tired and easily tired. I might as well play a supporting role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the epidemic was also going on at that time, I felt that filming supporting roles could be more fun and not be so stressful. You may say it&#39;s good to have more fun, but I have also reviewed it myself and found that those characters were really overplayed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Her and Her Her&quot; was a guest appearance to help, and I didn&#39;t think too much about it, because the role had to be played in a perverted way. I remember that the producer and director couldn&#39;t find anyone at that time, so they called me later. I had some friendship with the producer, so I went to help. I didn&#39;t want to attract everyone&#39;s attention, I just went to serve, serve. That role. I&#39;m not worried about losing the audience. The next role will be different. I&#39;ve never worried about it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The First Light&quot; is another story. It was really because of good luck. I had a good role as the &quot;baby&quot; and he had a lot of space. He found me only after the filming started. I was free at that time and even Director Yi Qi asked you to act, and I said yes. I said you have to give me time to prepare, because I need to find a teacher to practice high heels and dance. In fact, we prepared everything in private, chatting with those drag queens, eating and drinking with them, and imitating their looks and voices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So sometimes taking a role is not so calculated, sometimes it’s just a feeling, because the director is right, I go because the script is right, I go because there are certain actors, or I feel that If it helps this drama, I will do it. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;When you are not acting, you are just a nobody&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;In This Lifetime&quot; has helped me a lot in my life. I&#39;m really lucky to be able to film &quot;In This Life Time&quot; at this age. Xu Zhaoren is a very good director, and it is very difficult to perform his scenes well. It was the third time I worked with him that this time I seriously felt that I might actually have done a good job. In the past, I didn&#39;t feel like I was able to add points to his dramas, but this drama did a little bit, and I felt like I was finally worthy of him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Actually, I take myself very seriously. Sometimes the success of a drama is the result of the team, sometimes it is the credit of the marketing, and sometimes it is the accumulation of credits between the characters. It is absolutely impossible to do it because of one person. Man, this drama is hit or miss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have always been confident in my life as an actor. The so-called confidence means that I am willing to do it, not that I am very good. This is a concept. In the past, it was a very simple and clear thing to work hard and be rewarded. This thing has a profound impact on me. If you work, work hard, and sweat for the construction site, you will get the salary you deserve. This is a must-have condition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And be responsible. You really have to do your job well, otherwise the boss will scold you, fire you, or ask you to pack up and leave. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Acting is the same for me. Sometimes why you are so fat and why you are so thin is because no one has done it, and no one knows what can be gained from it. I want to know what I can gain from the state of mind of being hungry or obese. I think this is irreplaceable and is self-cultivation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s hard for you to tell others that I was hungry for 4 months from May to August last year. From &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; to &quot;May I Live Longer&quot;, I lost 53 kilograms. I was so hungry. , how I lived. People just say, wow. But it’s not because my character has to be so thin that you can see how great I am, no. It’s about putting the characters there and seeing the finished product in the end. Even if the movie doesn&#39;t go well, people will think you&#39;re just thin, so what&#39;s the big deal? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because you will really experience it after you do it. We are not like the protagonist of the anime. Why is he almost defeated in the end and still able to wake up? Because he thinks about his family and friends. Like Luffy in &quot;One Piece&quot; and Goku in &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, he suddenly doesn&#39;t know where he came from. strength. We are human beings, and we still have our own limits. Limits can only be reached through self-examination again and again. If people don&#39;t make mistakes, they won&#39;t know that they will make mistakes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was acting, I often made mistakes, and I still make them now. It&#39;s just that sometimes someone will correct your mistakes, sometimes not, but I always hope to meet a director who can deny you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development of each actor is different. Some talented actors need to retain their energy. I consider myself to be mediocre and I need to accumulate that energy. The growth process of each actor cannot be compared. Since it cannot be compared, there is no repetition. The lack of repetition means that only I understand what I am going through, and you will not understand. Only after each finished product comes out will you see the difference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When an actor is not acting, you are just a nobody. At most, you will be exposed to fashion or commercial performances, and you will see the glamorous star appearance. In fact, if you take away those appearances, who you really are is very vague. Celebrities have a popular persona, and that persona is the persona that the audience likes, because now everyone likes to see good things, kind people, and even people with high moral standards. The actor&#39;s appearance is very blurry, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with being blurry, it&#39;s just a different experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have always felt that actors are people living in the past, and the works you see are all me from the past. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Acting has never been free&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Actually, I have always felt that my work experience, having worked 50 jobs before I was 20, was not of much help to me. big. The accumulation of work experience is very life-like, but sometimes drama does not require you to perform life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, &quot;Copycat&quot;. It is a genre drama, and genre dramas are not life-like. If you want to stick to a life-like performance and conform to the rhythm of the camera and the director, when should you react? This is the pull between you and yourself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Playing Guo Xiaoqi in &quot;Copycat&quot; was very difficult for me, very difficult, extremely difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The skeleton of the genre drama is better written, but the portrayal of the characters may not be outstanding. Because it serves a crime and captures the real culprit, it takes the audience to see the reaction of each character. After watching it, the protagonist is actually empty. The so-called empty means that you can only accumulate some plots to serve the audience. How to put your own human flavor into it requires a lot of thinking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, you want to play him very smart, but you don’t want to play him too handsome, a little quirky, but you don’t want to make him too mythical. If you just look at the ferocity of the supporting characters, the main character will easily disappear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If &quot;Copycat&quot; is about using all the things accumulated in the past into one film, &quot;In This Lifetime&quot; is about forgetting all the things that I know. This is a transition between very skillful and unskillful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Acting has never been free. How can acting be free? Acting is very scientific, including lenses, camera positions, performances, types, and even opponents. Acting is very unfree but very organic. Any situation may affect the whole body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called lack of freedom is that you cannot perform exactly the way you want, sometimes because of the orientation of the camera, sometimes because of the rhythm, sometimes because of the opponent actor, and sometimes because of what the character wants to present. situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why do you think you have to take on so many roles? Because I think acting is a very passive profession, I just hope to put some of my own initiative into acting work in a passive situation as much as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The passivity of an actor is to be chosen. You will be there only after the script is written. If the script is not written, you will not exist. You may just act in another play. What space is there to be able to choose and take the initiative? That means to become thinner or fatter, to make the character more internal or more external, it doesn&#39;t matter. No matter what method you use, show your initiative. Those initiatives will affect the director&#39;s thoughts on the character, or the character can have a chemical reaction with other actors. This is the initiative that I think is valuable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s what acting is, you bring out your own life experience. If you don&#39;t have this life experience, you need to rely on a lot of field research and investment. Except for a few who can&#39;t do it, others can rely on self-study and hard work to accumulate the short one or two seconds on the screen to deceive everyone and say that I look like me. But when you go deeper, whether the performance is good or bad depends on each actor&#39;s own interpretation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, I like many senior actors, such as Mr. Li Xuejian from Mainland China, who can act at that age, or Mr. Jin Shijie, etc. Actors who grew up in Hong Kong in the 1980s and 1990s, such as Tony Leung Ka Fai, Tony Leung Chiu Wai, Nick Cheung Ka Fai, and Andy Lau, each actor has accumulated hundreds of dramas, leaving his own place. But for me, that kind of accumulation is very difficult. If I follow the current pace of actors, I will never be able to achieve it. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Nine years without an agent&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;I have been without an agent for about nine years. In the early years, I was still looking for one, but because of one job after another Come, I will keep acting. If there is a job, I will take it, if I get it, I will act, and if I act, I will go on stage. If someone says hello, I will applaud. I will say thank you, and I will keep acting like this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After four or five years, it seems that people (agents) no longer come to me. They seem to think that I can do this. But in fact, I am very busy and have many things to deal with, including contracts and work. Time, schedule. I haven&#39;t taken on so many commercial projects, and shooting commercials isn&#39;t too complicated. Relatively speaking, my acting life is pretty simple. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back now, I feel that every decision I made before was good. I did not sign for a big company, but signed for a small company, and I will live a happier life. Later, he left the protection of his original agent, and finally became an agent by himself for no apparent reason. I also have to be an assistant and carry my own bag, which contains travel supplies and stomach medicine. Be your own driver and drive to the scene, finish work by yourself, and borrow clothes by yourself. There are things to do and things not to do. There are some jobs that you can choose, and there are some jobs where you don’t have to make this money. If you don’t make this money, you won’t have so many burdens and baggage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am an actor, and what we talk about is what actors do. In fact, I rarely talk about conditions, because if you talk about conditions, it will be complicated and waste a lot of thought. Being able to act well is the first condition. I&#39;m not a person who likes to compare. I don&#39;t compare myself to actors of the same age and tell them what they are like. If you don&#39;t think about it, nothing will happen. If you think about it, something will happen. You feel you are at a disadvantage because you have a value standard and judgment: my salary must be so high, or my conditions must be so high. If you don&#39;t have this value standard, there is no such thing as suffering a loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, last year&#39;s &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; and &quot;May You Live Forever&quot; were both very low-cost movies, so why were they filmed? Because I like the script of &quot;Fudu Youth&quot;, I want to try to go out and experience life. Different environments will have different sparks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I did go, it was very worthwhile, and I made a great movie. &quot;May I Live Longer&quot; is from Hong Kong, so it&#39;s the same. I just read the script and said I would go. I didn’t talk about where I would live, and I didn’t even talk about my salary. The producer was surprised and said, &quot;Don&#39;t you ask about the price?&quot; I said I don’t need to ask about the price, just call the contract. He called over the contract and it was this price. I laughed. I know they don&#39;t have money. If I think I can accept it, I will go, and I will be very happy in my heart, and you will be very relaxed, because you have nothing to ask for, so you will go, just asking for a good performance in the play. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 2015 to now, I don’t want everyone to think that because my life has become easier, I am not willing to make progress. I also hope to accumulate something. At least the stuff coming out this year is above the level, and I don’t want to deal with the performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s hard to say fate. It’s unlikely that you will have a breakthrough in every drama, really. This is a market. To survive in this market, we can only rely on each drama and how to play the role well after joining. In fact, there is not much that actors can do. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[清远一所学校七百多名新生退学，官方回应]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259407]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-26 18:48:03&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In response to Qingyuan Desheng Health Vocational and Technical School’s blind expansion of enrollment in the fall semester of 2023 without approval and replacement with online courses In the case of face-to-face teaching, the Qingyuan Municipal Education Bureau has set up a city and county joint working group to station in the school, ordering the school to actively respond to the concerns of students and parents, conscientiously rectify problems, effectively protect students&#39; legitimate rights and interests, and ensure normal education and teaching order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qingyuan Desheng Health Vocational and Technical School is a private secondary vocational school with 3,981 students currently enrolled (including: 1,215 in the 2021 grade, 837 in the 2022 grade, and 1,929 in the 2023 grade).
