In October, two sub-district nurseries were unveiled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, Beijing was a &quot;poor student&quot; in childcare: as of the end of 2022, the number of childcare centers per 1,000 students was only 1.3, far behind the national average (2.03) and not as good as Shenzhen (2.0 ), Shanghai (2.12) and Guangzhou (3.58). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, 95% of childcare institutions in Beijing are for-profit, and there are only 2 public nurseries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why is childcare so scarce in Beijing? How to keep up with the pace of the country? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Finding a venue is not easy&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is not easy to find a venue for children. An insider in Beijing&#39;s health care system described to Southern Weekend reporters that of the two streets that were the first to open nurseries, one was &quot;squeezed&quot; and the other was &quot;borrowed.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Known as the first street-run nursery in Beijing, it is located in Xiaojing Automobile Station, a remote parking lot in Liuliqiao, Beijing. The Liuliqiao Sub-district Office is located in the corner of this parking lot, and the nursery is also squeezed out of the Sub-district Office&#39;s premises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a house of about 80 square meters, compactly equipped with a toilet, pantry, doll house, reading corner and a mini slide. Outdoor activities are held on the football field on the other side of the parking lot. This artificial turf formerly belonged to a badminton hall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After one month of operation, only 5 children have been enrolled out of a total of 18 places. The teachers’ explanation is that every new student needs to be assigned a teacher to follow him throughout the whole process. Counting the principal, there are 4 teachers in total. , &quot;Actually, our admission schedule has been until next month.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, its location is not ideal. It is backed by a highway. There is only one community within one kilometer nearby, and there is a main car road in front of the parking lot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a parent, a reporter from Southern Weekend participated in an enrollment meeting of a Liuliqiao subdistrict nursery school. Many of the parents who came to visit were not residents of the neighborhood. The advantage here is that it is cheap. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Nursery outside costs 7,000 to 8,000 yuan a month, but here it only costs 3,600 yuan.” A pair of “Beijing drifter” parents from Hunan told Southern Weekend reporters that the elderly at home could not help take care of their children, so they had to I found a nursery near the company, and including meals, the monthly cost was 4,200 yuan. This is almost the cheapest nursery in Beijing. &quot;Except for a public physical fitness classroom, the classroom where children usually stay is only 30 square meters.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in the end, they failed to make up their mind to deliver it. &quot;If you come here, you need to deliver it in advance in the morning. Counting the delay fee of 50 yuan/hour, the prices on both sides are almost the same.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A person in charge of a childcare institution told Southern Weekend reporters that childcare centers are more sensitive to distance. “Kindergartens can also radiate to nurseries within three kilometers of the surrounding area. It must be at the doorstep. It’s so cold in Beijing in winter, how many people would be willing to hold such a small baby and go out for more than ten minutes?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Desheng Children’s Center, located in No. 1 Xinfeng Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, is The second childcare center run by a street in Beijing is located in the core area where land is at a premium - Desheng Street. A two-story building with an independent courtyard, the first floor has been transformed into a nursery, and the second floor is still reserved as an early education center. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person responsible for operating this nursery is Han Xiaoliang, the founder of Huayu Tiancheng (Beijing) Childcare Service Co., Ltd. They originally opened a nursery in Desheng Street, which was a model park in Xicheng District . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2023, Desheng Street introduced Han Xiaoliang’s agency through bidding to operate the Desheng Children’s Center. Han Xiaoliang told a reporter from Southern Weekend, &quot;As long as I don&#39;t lose money, I am willing to participate. It can be regarded as making some contributions to the streets.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beijing’s guide price for inclusive childcare institutions is no more than 20% of the disposable income of residents in the district in the previous year. “The price is no more than 3,900 yuan.” The price of this nursery It is 3,600 yuan per month. Han Xiaoliang said that Beijing requires a teacher-student ratio of 1:7 for kindergartens over two years old. Under normal circumstances, there are 15 to 18 children with five teachers. &quot;We have just maintained a balance of income and expenditure, and still have a slight loss.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the last week of September, Desheng Street held a round of enrollment briefings. “On-site applications were made for 18 full-day cares and 12 half-day cares,” Han Xiaoliang said, including those who signed up later. , currently more than 50 support spaces are basically full. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The venue for this nursery does not belong to Desheng Street, but is borrowed from other communities. An insider in Beijing’s health system told Southern Weekend reporters, “This used to be a boiler room in a community that was renovated.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The for-profit nursery that Han Xiaoliang previously opened in Xicheng District also had to wait three or four years for the venue. &quot;It happened that a training school was not available during the epidemic.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person in charge of a chain kindergarten brand told Southern Weekend reporters that many districts in Beijing no longer approve new kindergartens. The Xicheng District Education Commission is one of the few that actively welcomes everyone to open kindergartens. Even if I have money, I can&#39;t find a suitable place.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned person familiar with the Beijing health care system said that even a venue like Liuliqiao is difficult to find, &quot;because we require that the venue must be rent-free.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Han Xiaoliang has also communicated with some streets before, and everyone is generally faced with the problem of space shortage. &quot;Some streets said that they are not enough for office space. Where can I find a house?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt=&quot;The first street-run nursery in Beijing.

Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Luo Huanhuan&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Of the 102 streets, 96 have no plans&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to Beijing’s plan, every street will have an inclusive nursery by 2025. In this regard, Southern Weekend reporters contacted a total of 121 streets in the five urban districts of Beijing, Xicheng, Dongcheng, Haidian, Chaoyang, and Fengtai. In addition to 19 streets that still received no answer after repeated calls, 102 of the streets that answered the call 3 are in planning, 3 are under construction, and 96 streets are still unplanned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qinglongqiao Street in Haidian District, Longtan Street and Dongsi Street in Dongcheng District are the three streets where nurseries will be opened after Liuliqiao and Desheng. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, the site in Qinglongqiao Street, Haidian District has been completed and is being filed. Longtan Street is speeding up construction and is expected to be completed in early December. Dongsi Street has found a place and is &quot;waiting for approval from above.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Chaoyangmen Street in Chaoyang District said, &quot;The street has no place to do it now, and we are waiting for the next plan from above.&quot; Panjiayuan Street also said, &quot;The space is tight,&quot; and Zuojiazhuang Street is planning middle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;No matter how tight the venue is, the street can find ways to solve it.&quot; The above-mentioned insiders of the Beijing health care system said that they all know that this matter is not easy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another worrying issue is how many children will be attracted once the nursery is built. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A staff member from the sub-district office told a reporter from Southern Weekend, &quot;Private childcare institutions only have 7-9 children, and it seems that the market demand is not very strong at the moment.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to survey data from the Social Affairs Department of the Beijing Municipal Development and Reform Commission, as of 2022, the average utilization rate of support seats in Beijing is 35.4%, with the highest being 64.9% and the lowest being only 13%. Most childcare facilities are vacant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Han Xiaoliang said that another for-profit nursery he runs has a monthly childcare fee of more than 8,000, and the occupancy rate is only 50%. Even the current inclusive nursery on Desheng Street is just full. There was no “hard-to-find” person as imagined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;There are so many worries about sending children to kindergarten after the age of three, let alone younger babies.&quot; Han Xiaoliang believes that the bigger issue now than building a nursery is how to change parents&#39; perceptions. &quot; We always regard two- and three-year-old children as incompetent and ignorant babies, and fail to realize that children also need a space to develop skills.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Beijing has launched a pilot program for inclusive childcare and announced that it will subsidize childcare institutions based on the policy of inclusive kindergartens, the specific details are still awaited. The above-mentioned person familiar with the Beijing Municipal Health Commission said that after the city issues the document, the specific details will still be determined by the district government. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The park has been open for more than a month, and Han Xiaoliang has not received any subsidies yet. &quot;They say they will be subsidized, but how? How much? We can only wait now.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Shanghai has already &quot;handed in the papers&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Shanghai, which is a few steps ahead of Beijing, has already seen a phenomenon where it is hard to find a job. In November 2023, data released by the Shanghai Municipal Education Department showed that the utilization rate of inclusive care seats in Shanghai kindergartens has reached as high as 90%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, the total fertility rates of Shanghai and Beijing will be only 0.74 and 0.87 respectively. The total fertility rate refers to the total number of children a woman gives birth to in her lifetime. A woman has an average of 2.1 children to ensure that the total population of the next generation does not decrease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The construction of inclusive childcare has just started in Beijing and has already been handed in in Shanghai. In 2017, Shanghai began to build inclusive child care centers, and the goal set at that time was to add 50 new centers every year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, Shanghai took the lead in the country in releasing the &quot;Shanghai Childcare Service Action Plan (2020-2022)&quot;, with the goal of opening at least one inclusive childcare center in every street and town in the central city by 2022. The coverage rate of universal child care centers in the city’s streets and towns shall not be less than 85%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The implementation of this action plan has been included in the supervision and evaluation of the district government’s performance of educational responsibilities, and key indicators have been included in the annual self-evaluation bulletin, becoming an important criterion for assessing the district government’s performance of its duties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, Shanghai has overfulfilled its task. At least one inclusive childcare center has been opened in every street in the central city, with the city-wide coverage reaching 95%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Weikai, the founder of &quot;Nursing School&quot;, is also the deputy secretary-general of the Shanghai Infant Care Services Committee, a professional committee under the Shanghai Early Population Development Association to assist the government in promoting infant care. Service is one of its functions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Weikai recalled to the Southern Weekend reporter that Shanghai conducted many pilot projects at the beginning, “from the earliest independent childcare institutions, to integrated early childhood care, and even community childcare such as ‘baby houses’. Do it. With a hundred flowers blooming, from the final practice point of view, it is most cost-effective to run kindergartens to solve the problem of parents sending care.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Across the country, Shanghai is the only one where the Education Commission is in charge of child care. In other places, the health commission is in charge of child care. To this end, the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission has specially established a &quot;Child Care Work Office&quot; to encourage kindergartens to extend downwards to open child care classes, requiring &quot;to open as many kindergartens as possible and as many as possible.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Weikai said that Shanghai’s publicization of preschool education is also the best in the country. “In the process of solving the problem of universal preschool education, childcare is also solved.” Data from the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission shows that nearly 1,000 kindergartens in the city have opened day care classes, accounting for 60% of all kindergartens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shanghai requires that newly built, renovated and expanded kindergartens all plan to provide childcare classes. Existing public kindergartens will consolidate resources and strive to add more childcare classes, and private kindergartens will actively offer inclusive childcare classes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public kindergartens enjoy the same per-student subsidy as a kindergarten degree—31,000 yuan per student per year. Inclusive private kindergartens offer daycare classes with a subsidy of 1,200 yuan per student per year. The Shanghai Municipal Education Commission also provides a one-time start-up fund of 100,000 yuan for each inclusive childcare center to support the purchase of toys, teaching aids, facilities and equipment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This makes Shanghai almost the city with the lowest childcare fees in the country. Monthly childcare fees for demonstration kindergartens are 700-800 yuan, first-level kindergartens are 270 yuan, and second-level kindergartens are 220 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Weikai said that in some core areas, kindergartens with the same academic qualifications have to queue up according to age, giving priority to older children. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Kindergarten is the main channel&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Among the four first-tier cities in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, Beijing’s action plan was the latest to be introduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shenzhen and Guangzhou issued action plans in 2020 and 2021 respectively. The &quot;Three-Year Action Plan for the Construction of Beijing&#39;s Childcare Service System (2023-2025)&quot; will be released in 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beijing’s goal is to have 4.5 childcare centers for infants and young children under the age of 3 per 1,000 people by 2025, of which inclusive childcare spaces will account for no less than 60%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the above action plan, Beijing will add no less than 62,000 inclusive child care places in the future, of which 30,000 will be provided by kindergartens and another 32,000 will come from streets, companies and other places. form. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned person familiar with the Beijing Municipal Health Commission told Southern Weekend reporters that this plan is dynamically adjusted. “When we made the plan, it was not clear how much preschool resources could be extended to child care classes. I made some estimates. The whole of Beijing is dynamically adjusted, and there will be no restrictions on which part can handle 32,000 and which part can handle 30,000.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with various forms of childcare such as streets and enterprises, kindergartens have obvious advantages. &quot;Of course, this will save manpower, material and resources than building an institution from scratch. The venue is ready-made, it can be approved quickly, and it is standardized. Moreover, parents have gained more trust in the kindergarten after so many years.&quot; The person familiar with the matter said. Classes must be the main channel.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The integration of child care is seen as a shortcut to inclusive child care, and its resistance mainly comes from the kindergarten itself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many industry insiders told Southern Weekend reporters that kindergarten teachers generally lack enthusiasm for opening day care classes. Compared with children over 3 years old, the work of children under 3 years old is more demanding and more difficult. Especially for public kindergarten teachers, the salary will remain unchanged and the workload will increase. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Weikai analyzed that since Shanghai’s Education Commission takes the lead in promoting day care, it has stronger execution capabilities than other cities led by the Health Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For many places, kindergartens need to give priority to solving the problem of &quot;large class sizes&quot; when running daycare classes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2022, when responding to the proposal to promote qualified kindergartens to open inclusive nursery classes to enroll children aged 2-3, Vice Minister of Education Zheng Fuzhi said that it has not yet been fully popularized across the country. In preschool education, although the problem of children aged 3-6 years old having difficulty enrolling in kindergarten has been alleviated, it has not been fundamentally solved. At present, kindergartens in various places have a relatively high proportion of &quot;large class sizes&quot;, and there are still millions of children studying in kindergartens across the country who exceed the class quota. &quot;In this case, areas that have achieved full universal access to preschool education must create conditions to add nursery classes. Areas that have not yet fully popularized preschool education, especially those with a low penetration rate, must provide kindergartens for those aged 3-6 and 0-3 years old. The relationship between admission and day care issues should be properly handled and promoted step by step.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Opportunities for professional institutions? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;A Shanghai childcare industry entrepreneur told a Southern Weekend reporter that after attending some industry exhibitions recently, he clearly felt that private capital was withdrawing from the childcare industry. “There are only some toy and teaching aid manufacturers participating. , almost no childcare companies can be seen.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;How can 7,000 yuan and 700 yuan compete?&quot; This entrepreneur has persuaded many friends who wanted to join the game in recent years. &quot;Now capital no longer cares about this.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Youer Academy is a national daycare chain brand. Founder Su Dezhong told Southern Weekend reporters, “In the future, inclusive schools will account for the majority. Starting from 2020, Youer Academy will be more closely related to the government and local state-owned enterprises. Business cooperation&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his view, kindergartens do not solve the problem of childcare by running daycare classes. “It actually solves the problem of kindergartens. Now kindergartens are facing a transition from ‘hard to find one child’ to ‘hard to find one child’” &#39;The problem&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The national “14th Five-Year Plan” requires that by 2025, there will be 4.5 nurseries for infants and young children under the age of 3 per 1,000 people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Su Dezhong made some calculations. Even if there are only 10 million births in the country every year, there will be 30 million people under the age of 3. By 2025, 4.5 places per 1,000 people will be achieved, which is about 6 million places. The actual enrollment rate is only 20%. Today, the enrollment rate in developed countries has reached 50%-60%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the contrary, he believes that the development of inclusive childcare is an opportunity for professional institutions. “The kindergarten system is very mature, but the childcare system is still in a blank period. Many kindergarten teachers don’t know how to get there. For children under 3 years old. What kindergartens save is the initial investment, but the challenges faced by kindergartens in terms of talent training and refined management are no different from those of corporate childcare and medical education.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;The question now is, &quot;Can the childcare services keep up? Can the price be reduced?&quot; At this stage, many childcare centers have not reached full capacity. Some people think that childcare is a false demand, and they are not satisfied with the demand. Su Dezhong gave an example, &quot;For example, if you open a restaurant or a nursing home, when your quality is not good enough or your service is not up to standard, people will not be able to actively go to the restaurant to eat, and the nursing home will not be full. But this is not a false demand, but a service. The quality is not good enough.&quot; He pointed out that many voices are now discussing how to open daycare centers, &quot;but the most fundamental thing is how to do a good job in daycare centers and how to improve service quality. Only when the service quality is good can this thing generate value. Only the urgent needs can be met.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of November, Beijing will have 6,000 kindergarten places to start enrolling students. For Beijing&#39;s first childcare center run by a street, the coming winter will bring it a tough test. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 15 Nov 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[与南方周末读者交换一本书，你要来玩吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260552]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-15 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Who in the clouds sends brocade books?

At present, the global per capita consumption of eggs is about 150 eggs per year, with more than 210 eggs in Europe and 300 eggs in China. In ancient times, eggs were not only food, but also a medicine for treating diseases. Since the 1960s, eggs have had a bad reputation for being unhealthy. For a time, many people were wondering whether they should eat eggs. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;A warning from a cardiologist&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Eggs’ “bad” reputation comes from cholesterol. As early as the early 20th century, scientists discovered through animal experiments that increasing the cholesterol in feed could increase the serum cholesterol levels of animals and promote the development of atherosclerosis in animals. Given that cardiovascular disease has become the leading cause of death in the United States, on June 16, 1948, U.S. President Harry Truman signed the National Heart Act and allocated $500,000 to launch a 20-year study on the epidemiology of heart disease. study, the Framingham Heart Study. In 1957, the Framingham Heart Research Team published a blockbuster study that concluded that elevated serum cholesterol levels were closely related to the risk of cardiovascular disease. In the 1960s and 1970s, scientists successively observed a certain correlation between dietary cholesterol intake, serum cholesterol concentration, and the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Unfortunately, since one egg (about 50 grams) contains about 200 mg of cholesterol, and eggs had become a daily food in the United States at that time, eggs inevitably became one of the &quot;culprits&quot; in the high incidence of cardiovascular disease in the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1968, the American Heart Association clearly stated for the first time that in order to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease, it recommended limiting dietary cholesterol intake, and for the first time proposed limiting egg consumption to no more than three eggs per week. This may have been the source of subsequent recommendations from nutritional experts or doctors around the world to limit three eggs per week. This recommendation from a group of American cardiologists on limiting egg consumption seems logical and easy to operate. It has been recognized by many and has gradually become an important basis for the United States and other countries in the world to formulate national dietary nutrition guidelines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The media&#39;s fueling has deepened the public&#39;s misunderstanding of eggs. The most typical example is the two cover reports on cholesterol in the American &quot;Time&quot; magazine. In 1984, Time magazine&#39;s front-page article was titled &quot;Cholesterol and Today&#39;s Bad News,&quot; and included a picture of a sad, round face on the cover of the magazine. The eyes were made of two fried eggs, and the sad mouth was Use a piece of bacon with both ends bent downward. Although Time magazine did not originate the bad reputation of eggs, its huge influence undoubtedly further deepened the public&#39;s association between eggs and &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol. Fifteen years later, Time magazine once again put an egg on the cover. The omelette still had the round eyes, but the mouth had been replaced by a melon with upturned sides, showing a cheerful smile. The corresponding front page The title of the article is &quot;Cholesterol, now the good news.&quot; Although this article marked a more scientific and comprehensive understanding of cholesterol among doctors and nutritionists, it did not quickly eliminate the misconceptions that had been instilled in the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the joint promotion of the medical community and the media, the bad reputation of eggs has lasted for more than 50 years. The biggest impact is undoubtedly the laying hen industry. From 1968 to the early 1990s, U.S. egg production basically stagnated, hovering around 4 million tons. During the same period, the U.S. population increased by more than 20%. Obviously, per capita egg consumption in the U.S. continued to decline during this period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/3wGetBG43ptbpUG1Vj1VHnQbf0cdR4trlEeWXiIN.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;687&quot; height= &quot;512&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/3wGetBG43ptbpUG1Vj1VHnQbf0cdR4trlEeWXiIN.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258239&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1984, Time magazine published a report with the title &quot;Cholesterol and the Bad News Now&quot; and included a picture of a sad, round face on the cover. Fifteen years later, the egg appeared on the cover again, with the mouth replaced by upturned melons on both sides, and the corresponding article was &quot;Cholesterol, Now It&#39;s Good News.&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;There is increasing evidence to the contrary&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Incredibly, there is a lack of direct scientific evidence that eating more cholesterol-rich eggs increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. Recommendations by the American Heart Association and others to limit egg consumption are based primarily on three imperfect pieces of evidence. The first is evidence from animal models that excessive cholesterol intake increases serum cholesterol levels and the development of atherosclerosis in animals. , the second evidence is epidemiological surveys showing that a high-cholesterol diet is associated with a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease, and the third evidence is clinical observations showing that high cholesterol intake leads to an increase in serum cholesterol levels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These three seemingly interlocking pieces of evidence have fatal flaws. Scientists generally use rats, guinea pigs, rabbits and other animals to conduct animal cholesterol feeding experiments. The amount of cholesterol added is much higher than the daily dietary cholesterol intake, and it often needs to reach the pharmacological level to cause changes in serum cholesterol levels. For example, researchers at the University of Arizona once fed a group of guinea pigs 0 (control), 0.08% (equivalent to 600 mg/day for humans), 0.17% (equivalent to 1275 mg/day for humans) or 0.33% (equivalent to 2475 mg/day for humans). mg/day) dietary cholesterol, and a positive relationship was found between dietary cholesterol intake and serum LDL cholesterol. However, in this study, there was no significant difference in serum cholesterol concentrations between guinea pigs fed 0 dietary cholesterol and feed containing 0.08% cholesterol. Serum cholesterol concentrations increased significantly only when higher doses of cholesterol were fed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Epidemiological survey results on the correlation between dietary cholesterol and the incidence of cardiovascular disease often &quot;fight&quot;, leaving the public confused and at a loss as to what to do. Most of the early epidemiological surveys relied on simple correlation analysis to draw conclusions. For example, they only recorded the consumption of eggs, but did not consider the impact of other dietary components, or even other factors that may cause cardiovascular disease, such as smoking and drinking. factors, so the conclusions of this type of research are unreliable. However, this type of research is often more eye-catching due to the large number of subjects involved and long follow-up time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the 1990s, an increasing number of studies have shown that egg consumption, dietary cholesterol, and the incidence of cardiovascular disease have little association. In 1999, researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health published a major study in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The researchers conducted a follow-up study of more than 117,000 people for 8-14 years. After excluding age, After controlling for smoking and other factors that influence cardiovascular disease, the results showed no significant difference in cardiovascular disease risk between those who ate one egg per week versus one egg per day. In 2015, researchers from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden conducted a 13-year follow-up study on more than 60,000 people and also concluded that daily egg intake was not related to the incidence of cardiovascular disease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some studies even suggest that eating eggs appropriately will reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. In 2018, researchers from Peking University, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Oxford University and other institutions conducted a cohort study involving 500,000 people and found that compared with basically no eggs, moderate levels of egg consumption (an average of 0.79 eggs/day) ), the risk of death from cardiovascular disease was reduced by 18% and the risk of death from hemorrhagic stroke was reduced by 28%. This is similar to the results of a 2003 study by the Hiroshima Radiation Effects Research Foundation in Japan. After following more than 40,000 people for 16 years, Japanese researchers found that people who ate eggs every day had a 30% lower risk of stroke death than those who did not eat eggs. People who ate 1-4 eggs a week had a corresponding risk of death from stroke. reduce. In a study of more than 130,000 adult subjects aged 40-69 in South Korea, researchers from Seoul National University found that among female subjects, compared with consuming less than one egg per week, Consuming more than 7 eggs per week is associated with a lower risk of metabolic syndrome. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Theoretically, randomized controlled trials are the most effective and reliable method to verify the association between dietary cholesterol and cardiovascular disease risk. Most randomized controlled trials have proven that eating 1-3 eggs per day has little effect on serum cholesterol levels, even for some diabetics. In a one-year randomized controlled trial, researchers from Maastricht University in the Netherlands asked volunteers in the experimental group to drink a buttermilk drink containing 1.5 lutein-rich egg yolks every day, while the control group drank no. A placebo containing egg yolk found that after one year there were essentially no differences between the two groups in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. On the contrary, there are some randomized controlled trials that show that eating eggs actually reduces the risk of metabolic syndrome. However, currently this type of randomized controlled trial has problems such as small samples and short observation time, and still needs further improvement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1995, the American Heart Association Guidelines, the National Cholesterol Education Program Guidelines, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Nutrition Facts Table all set dietary cholesterol recommendations at less than 300 mg/ days, and it is recommended to reduce the intake of animal-source foods such as eggs with high cholesterol. However, due to the lack of sufficient scientific evidence to prove that consuming normal levels of eggs or other dietary cholesterol is harmful to the human body, since the beginning of the new millennium, relevant agencies formulating dietary guidelines have successively canceled recommendations on limiting the intake of eggs and dietary cholesterol. In 2002, the American Heart Association removed the specific limit of 3-4 eggs per week while maintaining dietary cholesterol guidelines of less than 300 mg/day. In 2013, the American Heart Association officially announced that &quot;there is insufficient evidence to determine whether lowering dietary cholesterol will lower LDL cholesterol&quot; and canceled the dietary cholesterol recommendation of no more than 300 mg/day. Both the 2015-2020 and 2020-2025 editions of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans have removed the recommendation that dietary cholesterol consumption be less than 300 mg/day. According to the &quot;Scientific Research Report on Dietary Guidelines for Chinese Residents (2021)&quot;, currently only a few countries in the world, such as India and Australia, individually recommend eggs, and most countries recommend egg consumption of about 3 eggs per week. The &quot;Dietary Guidelines for Chinese Residents 2022&quot; recommends 1 egg consumption per day, and also states that &quot;eggs are rich in nutrients, and the yolks should not be discarded when eating eggs.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;It turns out that there is a feedback mechanism in the body&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Although most current dietary guidelines have canceled the intake limit recommendations for eggs and dietary cholesterol, the public is still concerned about the There are still doubts about eggs containing cholesterol, and they are worried that long-term eating of eggs will lead to increased cholesterol levels in the body and an increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease. Does high dietary cholesterol intake mean high serum cholesterol levels? Not entirely. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Research shows that only about 25% of the body’s cholesterol comes from dietary intake, and the rest mainly relies on its own biosynthesis. Since cholesterol plays an important role in the human body, almost all cells in the human body can synthesize cholesterol. The liver and intestines are responsible for synthesizing about 80% of the daily cholesterol required by the human body. The brain, adrenal glands and reproductive organs can also synthesize cholesterol efficiently. An adult weighing 70 kg synthesizes approximately 850 mg of cholesterol per day.临床喂养研究表明，膳食胆固醇每天变化100毫克，血浆总胆固醇水平平均会变化2.2-2.5 毫克/分升，相当于吃一个鸡蛋只会引起2%-3%的血清胆固醇变化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;原来，科学家发现人体存在一种针对胆固醇的反馈代偿机制，即当人体摄入过多的膳食胆固醇时，机体吸收和合成胆固醇的能力将受到限制，而且也将加速多余胆固醇的排泄和清除，从而维持血清胆固醇水平的平衡。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1991年，《新英格兰医学杂志》报道了一个吃鸡蛋“成瘾”的极端案例。一位88岁的男性老年人每天要吃20-30枚鸡蛋，持续时间至少有15年，但是医生发现他的血脂水平基本正常，其中血清总胆固醇竟然也维持在正常水平，平均值为5.18毫摩尔/升（正常范围3.12-5.72毫摩尔/升），而且患者也没有出现动脉粥样硬化等与胆固醇过量摄入相关的疾病。为了进一步研究这一特殊病例，研究人员进行了随机对照试验，实验组在常规饮食基础上每天每人加餐5个鸡蛋，不加鸡蛋的作为对照组，结果发现在常规饮食时，对照组摄入胆固醇的吸收率达53%，而在高胆固醇饮食即加餐5个鸡蛋期间，对照组摄入胆固醇的吸收率降至46%，但是88岁的老年人只吸收了18%的摄入胆固醇。与此同时，该患者的总胆汁酸合成速率是对照组的两倍，这说明该患者体内存在非常有效的代偿机制，在大量摄入鸡蛋胆固醇的情况下，一方面会减少摄入胆固醇的吸收，另一方面则降低人体胆固醇合成能力，从而维持总胆固醇的平衡。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，并非所有人对膳食胆固醇的反应都一样，一般会随着遗传、个体代谢水平、性别、年龄等多种因素表现出不同。研究表明，大约有2/3的人摄入过多胆固醇后，血清总胆固醇不会或只会轻微升高。这些人与上述88岁老人一样具有有效的胆固醇代偿机制，能根据膳食胆固醇摄入量，对胆固醇的吸收、排泄和合成进行相应的调整。但是另一些人则可能缺乏类似的代偿机制，摄入过多的膳食胆固醇，将会引发血清胆固醇较大幅度的升高。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;越来越多的证据表明鸡蛋或饮食中的胆固醇摄入与心血管疾病风险增加无关，而鸡蛋摄入可解决许多营养不足的问题，并且可为整个生命周期的整体健康作出重要贡献，因此大多数人都可放心吃鸡蛋，即使一些代谢综合征或心血管疾病患者也可正常食用，但是不能长期过多食用。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 15 Nov 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[河南武陟一中学发生踩踏事故，已致1死5伤]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260621]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-15 00:41:15&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;2023年11月13日上午10时许，武陟县兴华中学初一初二部分男生在期中考试间隙如厕时，因上下楼梯发生拥挤摔倒受伤，涉及的学生第一时间送往医院接受检查治疗。目前，1名学生经全力抢救无效死亡，1名受伤较重学生正在全力救治，4名受轻微伤学生住院观察治疗、近日即可出院。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;“&#39;通往旧金山&#39;不会是一马平川，不能靠&#39;自动驾驶&#39;。” 10月28日，王毅在华盛顿同美国战略界人士举行座谈会时表示，为此，双方要切实“重回巴厘岛”，把两国元首的共识真正落到实处，排除干扰，克服障碍，增进共识，积累成果。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这场座谈会由官方色彩浓厚的“美国阿斯彭战略小组”主办。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中美经贸关系是两国关系的“压舱石”。作为全球前两大经济体，中美两国经济总量超过世界三分之一、人口总数占世界近四分之一、双边贸易额约占世界五分之一。数据显示，2022年中美贸易额达到近7600亿美元，创历史新高。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;临近APEC前的11月8日至12日，中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理、中美经贸牵头人何立峰访美。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;访美期间，何立峰副总理与耶伦财长举行多轮会谈并共进工作晚餐，会谈时间累计超过10小时。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“目的是在7月双方北京会谈基础上，持续落实两国元首重要共识，为两国元首旧金山会晤做好经济成果准备，推动中美经贸关系回到健康稳定发展轨道。”11月10日，财政部副部长廖岷在美国旧金山的吹风会上说，其中达成如推动成立中美经济、金融工作组并举行会议等共识。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;7月耶伦一行人飞抵北京时，天空出现彩虹。国务院总理李强会见耶伦时提到，“中美关系经历过一轮风雨以后，我们一定会见到更多的彩虹。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“有一千个理由让中美关系搞好”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“我们有一千个理由让中美关系搞好，没有一个理由让中美关系搞坏。”10月9日，习近平主席在会见美国国会参议院多数党领袖查克·舒默时表示。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;旧金山“习拜会”前夕，美方10月初派出国会参议院代表团查克·舒默一行访华；10月底，加州州长加文·纽森一行23人访华。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;10月7日，美国参议院舒默在内的3名民主党人和3名共和党人国会代表团飞抵上海。这是四年来首次访华的美国国会参议院两党代表团。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“中美关系错综复杂，既有合作又有竞争。我们必须建立危机管控机制，恢复对话。”美国昆西国家事务研究所东亚项目首席主任迈克尔·史文告诉南方周末记者，随着美国选举年的到来，许多政客会利用反华议题为政治加分。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美国国会关键议员在涉华议题上拥有重要影响力。访华前，舒默曾多次敦促拜登政府采取对华强硬态势。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“美国无意和中国脱钩，但希望美国公司能在中国获得公平待遇。”10月7日，舒默会见上海市委书记陈吉宁时提到，美国并非为了挑起冲突，而是希望在美中经济竞争的情况下，获得公平竞争的环境。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;史文认为，美国应该明确遵守“一个中国政策”，表达让中国参与经济合作的意愿，努力提高亚太经济的稳定性。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美中贸易全国委员会发布的《2023美国对华出口报告》显示，超过7万家美企在华投资兴业，近90%在华业务实现盈利。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“去风险化并不是指彻底断开（与中国）经济联系，只是说有限制的。”美国哈佛大学教授约瑟夫·奈告诉南方周末记者，美国国家战略改用“小院高墙”去形容对华战略，但“我们不应该让这个小院扩大”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;近一个月来，中美在农业经贸方面发生了明显变化。11月7日，美国农业部派出17家参展商参加第六届上海进博会，同时为美国带回了60万吨的大豆订单。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;早在10月25日，中国驻美大使谢峰来到“美国粮仓”艾奥瓦州，参加中美可持续农产品贸易论坛。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;谢峰提到，金伯利农场的瑞克告诉他投资达5000万元的现代农业示范项目在浙江落户，而今天参加采购签约的中国企业代表将签署十余项农产品订单，价值数十亿美元。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;加州航道&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;加州州长纽森的访华行程更加多元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;加州州长办公室声明称，纽森团队的七天行程包括香港、深圳、广州、北京、盐城、上海，聚焦生态环境、应对气候变化以及清洁能源等主题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;10月24日，纽森率团抵达深圳。他们一行前往深圳巴士集团安托山智慧场站，试乘比亚迪电动汽车。“这是跨越性技术！我想买两辆，我们得想办法把它引进美国。”体验了仰望U8的原地掉头功能后，纽森赞叹。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同日纽森访问广州时，他与广东相关部门讨论了两省州多年来成功的气候合作。两省州相关部门还签署深化绿色发展合作谅解备忘录。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;加州州长办公室方面表示，这份新的谅解备忘录是两省州于2013年签署的相关谅解备忘录的补充。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;10月25日下午，习近平主席在人民大会堂会见了纽森。习近平主席再次强调，“中美关系基础在民间，希望在人民，未来在青年，活力在地方。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了气候问题，纽森的中国行还有两大目的，一是“促进经济发展和旅游业以及加强文化联系”，二是“打击针对亚裔的仇恨”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在加州从政多年，纽森是中美两国地方经贸合作的亲历者和推动者。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;纽森担任旧金山市市长时曾三次访华。2005年，纽森与已故联邦国会参议员黛安·范因斯坦访华时，正逢上海与旧金山结成友好城市25周年。2008年，纽森专门设立了旧金山对华办公室，以服务中国企业赴当地投资合作和当地企业迈向中国市场。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如今，加州连起中美交流的航道。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据美国人口普查数据显示，超过4%的加州人和超过10%的旧金山湾区人拥有华裔血统。洛杉矶港是美国参与中美贸易的最大港口，上海-洛杉矶航线是全球最繁忙的海运航线之一。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“中国越成功，世界就越成功。”纽森在回答央视采访时表示，他不认同所谓的“去风险”和“脱钩”，他说可以从世界“多元化”和正面竞争的角度来看待。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;金沙江。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（视觉中国/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;长江一夜变色。昨天傍晚从宜宾金沙江大桥经过时，望着还带绿，今天上午在李庄，趴在江边湿地的栏杆上看，已是一片浑黄，上游冲下来的浮萍载浮载沉，我的游泳计划暂时泡汤。不知为什么，这个夏天特别想游泳，去开阔的、没有天花板的水域游泳，来宜宾一大半原因就是游长江，之前看朋友发的照片，岷江淡黄，金沙江青碧，在宜宾交而不融，拉出一条长长分界线，我想到分界线上去看一看。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李庄早已整饬一新，除了个别幽静的庭院（譬如同济医学院旧址），不容易唤起对历史现场的想象，倒是几公里外板栗坳的“中研院”史语所旧址，因为和村民没有谈拢安置条件，保持了某种程度的“原汁原味”，当然你也可以说是破败。那个叫“田𡎚上”的杂院儿，左手屋顶塌了，就势圈几只大鹅，与躲在暗处的狗儿一起，对陌生人发出不耐烦的警告。往里走是个合院，青石地板，堆着柴火、竹竿和杂物，破旧电线横七竖八缠绕着黑瓦木墙，一只珍珠鸡站在高高的门槛上，墙上贴着好几张“此处危险，请勿靠近”的警示牌。住在这里的大哥告诉我，院子里有四五户人，上面让他们搬，但补偿标准只有750米一平，这个价格在别的地方买不起房，所以只要老屋不塌，他们就会一直住下去。要不是门口一块牌子的介绍，我断不知这里曾是史语所图书馆——还是“战时最好的中国文科图书馆”，啊，我想起来了，当时北大文科研究所之所以要离开昆明，跟史语所来李庄，就是因为他们丰富的古籍藏书。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;老屋外面正对一亩荷塘，荷叶拥叠，荷花星点，配上对岸密密的竹，淡蓝的天，有几分雅致，当年这里可曾“谈笑有鸿儒”？但鸿儒大概和我一样，“汗出如浆”。雨后阳光毒辣，地表万物蒸腾，川南的溽热露了真章。1941年夏天，梅贻琦、郑天挺、罗常培三人由昆明飞重庆，向国民政府教育部接洽西南联大校务，又顺江而上去四川，拜访迁到大后方的学术机构，走到李庄时，日记里处处喊热：“晚上温度表始终没降到九十度（摄氏32.22度）以下，热得我通宵没睡着”，“中午到镇上吃了一次饭，刚吹干了的汗衫又湿透了”（罗常培），“汗湿遍体，非只一次矣”，“去外衣打赤膊，并不更凉爽，只汗流较方便耳”（梅贻琦）。他们没有留下纳凉长江的记录，倒是和朋友们的交谈——听梁方仲谈陕北的考察，听凌纯声谈滇缅勘界的故事——“好像服了清凉散一样，给我们祛除了不少的暑气”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我坐车回宜宾，在老城区下车，所谓“古街”十分无聊，转到戎州大桥上看金沙江与岷江汇合，金沙江更浑了。闷热难耐，我浑身湿透，跟桥上的看桥人（竟忘了问他的职责）聊哪里适合游泳，他给我指桥下某处水岸，提醒我游的时候要小心XX——他说了一个我听不懂的双音节词，大概就是分水处吧，过了XX会被水流带到远离岸边的地方，不容易回来了。我下桥，沿着窄窄石梯走到水边，刚游完泳的两男一女独享这里，他们带了盒饭准备野餐，我问水急吗，他们似乎被这个显而易见的问题冒犯到了，半晌，用生气的四川话说：不是急，是很急！再往下就是合江门，岷江汇入金沙江处，也是“万里长江起点”，看介绍，汇流处水深30米，好家伙。合江处建有广场和“长江之珠”纪念球，最下方是一片和缓回水，以浅黄的岷江水为主，偶尔冲来几条细细的金沙江红色水流，一些人在下面游泳，看起来很安全，但实在激不起我下水的欲望，这里更像城市内涝时一个被淹的立交桥，谁想在立交桥下面游泳呢？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我决定在宜宾多待一天，等金沙江变清。白天去博物馆看展，见画家陆俨少的《岩栖待访图》，那位隐居山中的打坐者，他的山屋实在像个防空掩体，再看落款，1941年3月绘于重庆南坪，正是日军集中轰炸之时。创作者是如何感受和经验现实，然后完成作品的构思与想象的呢？我好奇地搜来陆俨少的回忆录，1938年2月，他从上海撤到重庆，“在城内怕轰炸，在乡下怕土匪，计无所出”，辗转到兵工厂农场任职，负责记工记账，闲时写字、看书、访友，他曾经去沙坪坝拜访丰子恺，后者在平冈上造了几间草屋，前后矮篱遮护，还养了几只鹅，“因无人介绍，我便自己闯进去，他不以我冒昧，后来还和我通过信。”1941年，陆俨少33岁，第四个孩子出生，他养鸡喂猪种菜补贴家用，但因井水不洁，饮水困难，好在后来兵工厂把长江水抽上来供职员饮用，让他体会了杜甫写的“斗水何值百忧宽”——入川时，他的行李里只带了一本书，就是钱注杜诗，“闲时吟咏，眺望巴山蜀水，眼前景物，一经杜公点出，更觉亲切……东归无日，心抱烦忧，和当年杜公旅蜀情怀无二，因之对于杜诗，耽习尤至。”1945年8月抗战胜利，各方人士纷纷复原东归，陆俨少思乡心切，但买不到船票，恰好有友人做木材生意，遂搭木筏出峡，虽然险阻，但也有了近距离观察水势的机会，“可以细审其势，得谙水性，而传统山水，各家各派，无不尽备，诚非轮船急驶所能仿佛一二。在三峡之中，走了一个多月，比读十年书得益更多……也因有了三峡看水的生活体验，用勾线办法创造出峡江险水的独特风格，只行海内，为他家所无。从而得出结论，画山水必须到山水中去。自文沈四王以下，类在故纸堆中讨生活，陈陈相因，以致每况愈下。但是眼睛看了，必须用脑子想，大之所谓看其神气，小则一树一石，怎样表现，都要有个琢磨……必须带些新方法回来……否则是白去一趟。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;下午5点多，长江的水更浑更急了。水幕广场附近，长长的亲水平台红泥汤拍岸，水清时大概是绝佳天然泳道吧。我脱鞋下去感受流速，不及膝深，但撞击力量明显。一艘货轮逆流而上，浪头向两边扩散开来，几个带着跟屁虫从上游漂流下来的泳者一边避让一边高声大笑，大概是爽到了。我沿江往上游走，回到两江汇合处，岷江在对岸直冲过来，反而在这里造就了又一片回水，两水并未充分混合，泥浆中悬浮着许多丝状半清水。一位大哥坐在墩子上，他也是来游泳的，但嫌水脏，“以前一个晚上就变清了，今天还是很浑，可能是上游水库排沙”，又说几天前这里淹死了三个人，有两个人是他眼看着躲避不及被大船拍到水底下的，“到现在还没有找到”。我问他在两江江水交界处游泳是什么感觉，“一会凉一会暖和”——金沙江水冬暖夏凉，岷江则相反，所以本地人喜欢游金沙江，尤其冬天，水很暖和，“泡在里面不想上来”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第三天，长江仍不见清，我决定不再苦等，去上游的水富看看。水富属云南昭通，但离四川宜宾要近得多，载我的顺风车司机和我聊天，说水富和宜宾口音差不多，吃的也差不多，“但没有我们那么爱吃爱玩”。我请她尽可能沿江行，于是她选择了南岸一条坑坑洼洼的老路，滴滴小程序死命不肯接受这条满是大货车的老路，一路叫唤，“您已偏航，请在适当位置掉头”。一开始还有点烦，听久了我突然高兴起来：偏航不就是旅行的目的之一吗？没有偏航哪有惊喜呢？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;惊喜随后就到。车近水富，我在颠簸中望见浑浊江面上有不规则的蓝绿色，以为自己看错了，毕竟阳光刺眼，又不断被灌木遮挡。但司机说她也看见到了。不一会儿，我俩都确认了：对岸，也就是江的北岸，确实有一条细细的蓝色。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;是因为北岸有清澈支流注入吗？车往前开，那条蓝色越长越大，直到和这浑黄势均力敌。我点开手机地图，终于意识到，金沙江一直是蓝的，只因前方有一条大支流横江自南岸注入，带来滚滚泥沙，以至于把整条干流都染黄了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;过川滇界时，司机紧张起来，她的微信群里有人提醒：前方有运管，查网约车。说是逮着一个车要罚三千到一万，虽然只跑了十几天滴滴，她已经感到了“好大的压力”。我们七绕八绕，躲开了，到终点时，她长舒一口气，“你到了我就安全了”，又跑到后备箱给我拿了两个大鸭梨，说是老家种的。在酒店办理入住，我选了正对向家坝水电站的房型，但并没有看到想象中的高峡平湖——大坝162米高，我所在的10层，连坝顶都远不可能窥见，若以水库湖面为基准，我此刻身处水下一百多米的地方，这让人有一种头顶水盆的奇怪感觉。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;坝下河水碧蓝得令人心醉，十来只白鹭在岸边觅食。吃了只梨子，我也出门觅食，这儿果然和宜宾口味接近，一两素燃面、一两口蘑面、一碗冰镇银耳汤，一共16元。心满意足去看江，最近的是向家坝大桥。上桥就被小小震撼。今日35度高温，水富树不多，整个城市被晒得白花花的，可一到桥头就凉下来了。这应该也是头顶水盆的功劳：水库深水区常年温度较低，坝下出水寒凉，下游河谷自然就成了冷柜。站久了我甚至觉得两腿冰凉。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由桥往下一公里多，红泥色的横江在右岸注入，于是这之前的一公里多碧蓝金沙江，就成了水富人的大泳池。我踩着被太阳晒得滚烫的大石头下到水边，一位好心的大哥见我跟屁虫，又多番提醒注意安全。这里水深且急，是游泳协会的地盘，都是高手在中流击水，大人会质问来玩水的小孩：你的家长在哪里？我贴着岸边游了会儿，水确实急，游了半天还在原地，但总算拥抱了这可爱的江水。凉，但没有想象中凉。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我谢过大哥，继续往下游走，经过了一处真正的回水区，近岸的水以极快的速度逆流而上，又经过一处滩涂，水里是成群小鱼，受惊后变换出不同形状。再往下，是一个人工修筑的水泥平台，被江水没至齐腰深，刚好用作浅滩，这里水流缓慢，游泳的人也最多。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在桥上和高处，你很容易看见河中间因为流速最快，像滚开一样，许多白色的漩儿，从内往外画着圆圈，大大小小的圆圈。但下到水中，视线与水齐平，你看到的更多的就是线条，或明或暗的线条，扰动的波纹，还有水光，洒满金粉的水光是多么迷人啊。等你整个人泡在这清凉的碧蓝的水中，意识就好像消失了一般，只感到极大的自由和快乐，过了许久，我的脑海里才兀的冒出一句无厘头的话：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我愿意大口大口喝水。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我闻到了小时候在湘江游泳时熟悉的淡淡水草味，从水里看天空的粼粼波光也似曾相识，河中间有呼啸声，像是神灵在筛豆子，偶有水流冲过来，让你身体一激灵。自由。自由从周围无尽伸展开来。越往深处越感到自由。可惜我不会写诗——我在水里想——只有诗歌才配得上这里的韵律。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“让人们游泳吧！”这是住在柏林的作家PaulHockenos给《纽约时报》一篇专栏文章的标题。这个炎热的夏天，他造访了慕尼黑，发现全城的人几乎都在伊萨尔河纳凉游泳。这条多瑙河支流曾经污染严重，2000年，彼时气候危机还未加剧，欧洲的夏天不算难熬，慕尼黑有先见之明地对伊萨尔河进行了大规模修复，这项历时11年、耗资3800万美元的工程包括净化河水、扩大河漫滩、改造河岸以适应春季来自阿尔卑斯山区的汹涌融雪洪水。如今，这条河成了一个重要的公共空间，为人们提供避暑场所。“我没有阳台，没有花园，但我有伊萨尔河。”Paul Hockenos的一位朋友说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我是后来才意识到，我这么想要到一条真正的河流里去游泳，是为了告别一种害怕的感受，一种过去几年累积起来的自己吓唬自己的感受。在水里感受到的纯然的自由和快乐，实在是久违了。“疗愈”如今已经被过度使用，但它仍然是真实的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我想起前些年大量研习西南联大时，对那段历史当然有千般观感，但印象最深的无非三字：“不害怕”。我也想起好多好多年前初当记者时，采访一位学者，他谈起“听喝”，“听喝那是奴才，结果现在有人自愿听喝，一挥手大家全走，就这样。”那时候我经历太浅，只能在字面上理解“听喝”对一个人完整性的破坏。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;游泳后的一整天我都沉浸在快乐和幸福之中，傍晚又沿着金沙江走了半天。好像整个城市的人都在江边散步，有大河的城市确实是被祝福的。回酒店的路上，我远远看到大坝上头一排灯光，像是城墙。我吃着4.99元的香辣鸡腿堡看完了游泳世锦赛最后一日比赛，脑子里不断重现下午看到的、摸到的、置身其中的碧蓝。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;

&lt;p>;据极目新闻报道，王海在网络发文称，江西新能源科技职业学院的张老师无意中发现同在该校负责学生实习工作的前妻颜某某有600万元巨额存款，同时还发现了一个涉及金额数千万元的账本，记录了多家人力资源机构转账给学校多名领导的资金明细和分配比例。其中一页显示，仅一个39名学生、为期4个月的实习，就收到“管理费”近13万元，其前妻分了1.4万多元，另一名领导则分了11.4万多元。爆料人提供的银行流水也显示，从2017年来，有多家人力资源公司以“用工企业支付培养费用”的名义，频频向颜某一关系人的账户转账，金额从数千元到数万元不等。这些钱最终到了颜某某手里。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;600多万的数字有点骇人听闻，从文中看这还只是院长助理分到的小头。王海的举报是否属实，有待相关部门的调查结果。不过，职业学校以组织学生实习为名，行“劳务输出”之实，从实习企业处收取费用，甚至克扣学生的实习报酬，早就不是什么秘密。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;几年前，由于一些制造业企业招工难，职业学校学生成为一些劳务中介公司的目标。职业学校于是找到生财之道：与劳务中介合作，以实习的名义，组织学生到企业工作，收取管理费、培养费等。极目新闻的报道中，江西新能源科技职业学院一名前副院长就坦承，学生到企业实习工作，学校确实能收到一笔管理费用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些钱，企业当然不会白出。在一些地方，除了学校收钱，学校领导和实习带队老师个人也能分到回扣。这次事件中，爆料人提供的一页账本显示，该校学生到苏州某企业实习，每工作一小时，学生的报酬是15元，学校则可以得到4元，院长助理个人也能收到5毛钱。当然事件真相究竟如何，还有待调查。不过类似事件此前已有先例，2021年，贵州铝业技师学院被曝通过中介公司安排学生实习，从实习单位给学生的报酬中收取每生每月1500元至2000元不等的费用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;职校学生到企业“实习”，报酬低，劳动强度却不低。2021年，湖南临武县职中组织学生到该县一家公司实习，每天要干活11个小时。同年，湖北丹江口市汉江科技学校部分学生被学校安排到某科技企业实习，每天工作十几个小时。而这些“实习”工作，往往与他们所学的专业没什么关系。计算机专业学生被安排“搬箱子”，学护理专业的被安排到美容院、发廊。这些所谓实习，其实就是纯粹的体力劳动，完全起不到提升职业技能的作用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;长时间繁重的劳动，就是成年人也受不了，更别说刚成年甚至还未成年的职校生了。不少人的身心受到严重的摧残，甚至有人因为疲劳工作等原因导致工伤致残。临武县职中的学生小鹏就在实习中被机器夹伤了手，导致两根手指被截肢。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在人们的印象里，普通高校大学生毕业前也都会实习，但学校通常不会组织安排，最多是提供相关信息，要学生自己联系实习单位。但职业学校不同。职业教育法规要求学生“应当”参加实习实训，实习经历就成了职校学生毕业的必要条件。一些职校拿着毕业证这一尚方宝剑，逼着学生参加学校组织的“实习”，“不去实习就不给毕业证”，实习时间太短，不能为学校带来足够“价值“”，也不行。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;职业学校大多数是中专层次，招收初中毕业生。因为中考“五五分流”，有大约一半初中毕业生要上职校。这些学生大多才十五六岁，刚刚结束更侧重管束的教育阶段，心智并没有完全发育成熟。相对于这些稚嫩的学生，学校、老师无疑处于绝对的优势地位。这些权力，在一些学校和老师手里就异变成了割学生韭菜的镰刀。这些学校，不是想着怎么提高教学质量，教会学生真正的职业技能，而是挖空心思想怎么能在学生身上压榨出更多的油水。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这样的职业教育，难怪家长和学生们弃之如敝履。要搞好职业教育，首先要打破这种畸形的权力格局，让职业学校回归教育服务提供者的角色。学生则可以来去自由，不被学籍束缚，如果觉得某所学校、某个专业不好，可以随时离开去其他学校或专业，只要学满足够的课程、学会足够的技能，都可以毕业。这样才会促使职业学校在教育市场展开竞争。以教学、就业质量等指标赢得学生和家长的青睐，而不是把学生当成摇钱树和待割的羔羊。&lt;/p>;

He originally thought he would deal with fruit trees for the rest of his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Three years later, the college entrance examination resumed, and 23-year-old Zhu Yong entered the Department of Political Education of Anhui University to study. Nowadays, this age may have graduated with a bachelor&#39;s degree, but at that time, the eldest classmate in Zhu Yong&#39;s class was already 31 years old, and there were fathers and sons enrolled in other departments at the same time. In his own words, &quot;it was delayed for four years, but not too long.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The prelude of reform and opening up has been played, and the spring tide is surging in the economic field. At the end of 1978, Anhui University changed the 1977 Department of Political Education into the Department of Philosophy and Economics. Zhu Yong wanted to be transferred to the Department of Economics, but failed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Later, he continued to study for a master&#39;s degree in Chinese legal history at Anhui University, and entered China University of Political Science and Law to study for a doctoral degree in Chinese legal history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In June 1987, the Degree Evaluation Committee of China University of Political Science and Law officially decided to award Zhu Yong a doctorate in law - the degree certificate number is &quot;Bo 87001&quot;. He is He is the first doctor of legal history in New China and the first doctor of law trained by China University of Political Science and Law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;October 12, 2023. On the campus of China University of Political Science and Law, pedestrians walk in a hurry. When I walked into Zhu Yong&#39;s office and saw a whole wall of books, time seemed to slow down again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the interview, he mentioned twice that his experience was relatively dull and he hoped to write in a &quot;low-key&quot; and &quot;plain&quot; style. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhu Yong said that a few years ago, he accepted the task of compiling and organizing the &quot;(Newly Edited) General History of China&quot; and the &quot;History of Chinese Legal System&quot;. His current wish is to compile a special history that truly represents the evolution of Chinese law and to gain recognition from both the legal and historical circles. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&quot;I vaguely feel that the direction of society is changing&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left ;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In 1974, you had just graduated from high school at the age of 18 and jumped in line at the Shushan Garden Farm in the suburbs of Hefei. . What kind of work did you do at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Mainly working on fruit trees. This includes loosening soil and fertilizing fruit trees, weeding and pruning, spraying pesticides and drainage, picking and caring for fruit trees, etc. Fruit trees are highly seasonal and more tiring than farm work. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Eating peaches feels good, but picking peaches in summer is particularly uncomfortable. If you wear too much clothes, you will feel hot; if you wear too little, the peach hairs will feel itchy if they stick to your body. In the peach orchard, the branches are low and the ground is full of ditches and bumps. I can only bend down and carry the baskets of peaches out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, hundreds of young people gather at the garden farm, and they can always find fun. When the fruit is ripe, it needs 24 hours of supervision. If you work the night shift, you won&#39;t be able to sleep for 8 hours at night. Someone came to steal the fruit, and everyone was very excited. They divided their troops to guard and try to catch the person. No one came to steal, but the night felt boring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Waiting in the garden After 4 years, do you have a chance to read a book? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Basically there are no books that we like to read. There are some learning materials that I generally don’t like to read. At that time, those who &quot;criticized Lin Biao and Confucius&quot; called Confucius &quot;the second son of Confucius&quot; and extracted his remarks for criticism. Everyone thinks what Confucius said is quite reasonable, but after listening to expert analysis, they feel that what the experts said is also reasonable. Only then will I be interested in reading it. After reading it, I can show it off by chatting with others. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are also a few readings that are circulated privately, and people are eager to get the books. For example, &quot;Three Heroes and Five Righteousness&quot; is about Bao Gong and a group of heroes who travel the world. Too many people have read this book, and dozens of pages are either damaged or rolled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I have thought about myself Any chance of going to college? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I didn’t think about this issue when I jumped in line. At that time, there were also university students from workers, peasants and soldiers, but the number of places was very small. This was almost impossible on our farm. My personality can be summed up in two words: casualness. I feel that since everyone can bear it, then work hard, and you will not be so tired when you enter management in the future, and there is still hope. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I didn’t expect it to be that far back then. If there had not been reform and opening up, I would have worked on the farm for the rest of my life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When did you start Are you aware of a change in social trends? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;At the end of 1976, one day we were working together in the reservoir. The loudspeaker suddenly switched to another channel and played the song &quot;The Waves of Honghu Lake&quot;. Although the noise is extremely loud, the melody is melodious. Hundreds of people put down what they were doing and stood quietly listening. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, many songs before the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; could not be played. Everyone thought it was incredible, how could this song be played? I have a vague feeling that the direction of society is changing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It was at that time that Xinhua Bookstore began to sell classic novels such as &quot;A Dream of Red Mansions&quot;, &quot;The Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, &quot;Water Margin&quot; and &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, but there was a queue to buy the books. Very long queue. I have a very good friend among the educated youth, whose family works in Xinhua Bookstore in Hefei City, so I asked her to buy a set. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How did you know Restore the college entrance examination news? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The summer of 1977 was the season when fruits were ripe, and there was no official announcement yet. The college entrance examination is to be resumed, but some people are already talking about it privately. If it is spread too much, everyone will believe it. In the orchard, the young man works the night shift. After getting off work at four or five in the morning, he takes a nap first and then reviews his books. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I have been hesitating for a while, feeling that I have lost so much time studying and I don’t want to take the college entrance examination. My mother was hospitalized in other places at the time, and she asked people to pass on the message through various channels. She said absolutely that if I didn&#39;t take the college entrance examination, she would not come home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the beginning, everyone was not very enthusiastic about reading the book. They just felt that others were reviewing and it would be inappropriate not to review themselves. In October 1977, &quot;People&#39;s Daily&quot; officially announced the resumption of the college entrance examination, and everyone went all out to change the status quo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are many educated youths on our farm who have signed up to take the college entrance examination. Later, many people asked for leave for various reasons. At first, the farm required that educated youths were not allowed to take leave and were not allowed to read during working hours. But the leaders at all levels of the farm are also relatively simple and kind-hearted. They also have children and understand our urgency for the college entrance examination, so they still have a certain degree of laxity in management. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Going to the Department of Philosophy for my undergraduate degree&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern China Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Professor Mo Lifeng from the School of Liberal Arts of Nanjing University has a similar experience to yours. They both joined the team in Anhui and were both admitted. Anhui University, where he later became the first doctor of literature. He once said that he was very ambitious before going to the countryside. He applied for Tsinghua University in his first three choices, but after staying in the countryside for 10 years, he only dared to apply for Anhui University. What impact do you think the four years of queue jumping had on you? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When I applied for a volunteer, my vision was not broad enough and I did not think of going to another province to go to school. I applied for liberal arts. I felt that Anhui University was the best school within my knowledge, so I applied. Later I learned that with my scores, I could only get into Anhui University. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The 1977 College Entrance Examination in Anhui Province was held from December 10th to 11th. Shortly after the Spring Festival, I received the admission notice from Anhui University. Although I will report to the university soon, after the Spring Festival holiday, I still went back to work in the second farm team, thinking that I should stand on the last shift. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, our second brigade had a walking tractor that collected feces from public toilets every day and fertilized the fruit trees. The body behind the tractor was broken, and the brigade secretary asked me to send it to a repair shop for repairs. It was so cold that the remaining feces on the truck bed was frozen. Before repairing, it had to be thawed with hot water and then wiped clean. At this time, I thought, I will leave the farm next week anyway, report to the university, and let this matter go. After that, I started my academic career of reading and teaching. However, my failure to get the tractor body repaired has long been a problem of mine. Later, I went back to the farm to visit the old secretary of the brigade, and I apologized to him specifically. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I am lucky. Shushan Garden Farm, as my first foothold into society, allowed me to plan my life based on the principles of positivity and contentment, and to get along with others with a kind and optimistic attitude, which benefited me a lot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After arriving at Anhui University , why choose the Department of Philosophy? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When I applied for my application, I applied for the Department of Political Education of Anhui University. Around the end of 1978, the school adjusted its majors and changed our ’77 students in the Department of Political Education into philosophy and economics respectively. At that time, the prelude to the country&#39;s reform and opening up had begun, and the economic field was booming. Most of the students hope to enter the Department of Economics, and I also want to adjust to the Department of Economics. But maybe it was because I did not do well in mathematics in the college entrance examination that I entered the philosophy department. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; How is everyone&#39;s enthusiasm for studying? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Everyone really valued their time at that time. There is a big age gap between the classmates in our class. The oldest was born in 1947 and the youngest was born in 1962. There is a 15-year age difference. In other departments, there are fathers and children admitted at the same time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The lights in the dormitory are turned off at 11 o&#39;clock in the evening, and many students go to read under the street lamps. At &lt;span>;four or five&lt;/span>; o&#39;clock in the morning, the street lights went out and the canteen lights came on. There is always a row of classmates holding books outside the cafeteria window. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;In 2000, Zhu Yong (middle), his master&#39;s tutor Chen Shengqing (first from left), and doctoral tutor Zhang Jinfan (first from right) attended an academic conference at Anhui University.

At that time, the school distributed work uniformly, and they were all good units. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the early 1980s, the construction of the national legal system was initially launched. Everyone thinks that the legal system is an effective means of national governance, but no one can clearly explain the &quot;legal system&quot;. The more this happens, the more expectations they have for the legal system, and they believe that legal talents have great development prospects. My parents didn’t understand what legal history was, but they knew that I majored in law, so they fully supported my application for a master’s degree in Chinese legal history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When I was in my third year of master&#39;s degree, I learned that Professor Zhang Jinfan of China University of Political Science and Law was recruiting doctoral students in Chinese legal history, so I decided to sign up for the exam. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Cooking noodles and talking about academics&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern China Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In February 1985, you went to China University of Political Science and Law to study for a PhD in Chinese legal history. What was your first impression of this school? What is it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The first impression is the legal awareness of Fa Da people. When I first came here, the Third Ring Road was being built near the north gate of the school. Once while taking a bus, I saw a law student having a dispute with the driver over the parking issue of the bus. The driver thinks it&#39;s almost enough, don&#39;t take it seriously. But students said the driver did not follow the rules. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After experiencing the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, people at that time generally had little sense of rules. The awareness of rules among law students is refreshing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You are Chinese political and legal Did the first batch of PhD students recruited by the university receive &quot;special preferential treatment&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The school gave me and my fellow seniors Zheng Qin and Huai Xiaofeng a scholarship. We bought a tape recorder and let us learn foreign languages. At that time, cassette recorders were very expensive, costing more than 400 yuan each. The second batch of doctoral students will not be issued. The management attaches great importance to us, but they use too much force. Maybe they don’t know what kind of learning conditions they should provide to doctoral students. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The language I study is English. The school thinks that a doctorate is a higher level than a master&#39;s degree. It is not appropriate to take classes with master&#39;s students, and it is difficult to be alone. Give us foreign language classes. So I was asked to attend a training class in Changchun to learn foreign languages, and the expenses were reimbursed. Training courses are very expensive, with foreign teachers attending classes and students staying in hotels. When you return to school, you don’t need to take another exam. A training certificate will count as passing the foreign language course. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The 1980s , the doctoral training system is still in the exploratory stage.

It is somewhat similar to the master-apprenticeship system in traditional Chinese society where a master leads an apprentice. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When we were studying, Mr. Zhang was the vice president and dean of the graduate school. His schedule was very full, but lunch time was fixed. We proposed that we let him come to our dormitory at noon on weekdays, use an electric cup to cook a cup of noodles for him, beat an egg, and teach him while eating. The four masters and apprentices closed the door, whispered, cooked noodles, and talked about academics, having fun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although I majored in legal history for my master&#39;s degree, I did not receive systematic legal training during my undergraduate period, and the basic theories of law are relatively lacking. Mr. Zhang taught students in accordance with their aptitude and believed that I should pay attention to the construction of the legal knowledge system and allowed me to audit civil law, criminal law, procedural law and other courses for master students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, everyone from our tutors to the graduate school encouraged us to take full advantage of the concentration of academic talents in Beijing. We went to Peking University, Renmin University, Institute of Law of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and other institutions to take courses, participate in discussions, and visit famous teachers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Zhu Yong&#39;s doctorate certificate, number is &quot;Bo 87001&quot;.

Can you talk about the writing process of your doctoral thesis? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;My doctoral thesis is a continuation of my master&#39;s thesis. At that time, basic research was relatively weak, many studies were not conducted, and the selected topics were not easy to repeat. In this case, it is not difficult to select the topic for my thesis. The key is to find first-hand information, and it will be easy to produce results. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;While studying for a master&#39;s degree at Anhui University, the school gave the master&#39;s degree a thesis investigation fee of 300 yuan. It took me almost two months to travel to more than a dozen provinces. My main task was to check the family laws and regulations recorded in the genealogies of various places. At that time, in the southern provinces, genealogies were managed not primarily as books but as cultural relics. Therefore, genealogies are mostly stored in museums. Most of the genealogies from various places have been in existence for 100 to 300 years. The paper is yellowed and covered with insect holes. You have to read it carefully, and it will break easily if you are not careful. None of this raw material has been used before. In two months, I hand-copied thousands of cards about family laws and clan rules in museums in more than a dozen provinces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When I was studying for my Ph.D., I spent a lot of time consulting in the ancient book library of the Beijing Library located in the Imperial College and the First Historical Archives of China located in the Xihua Gate of the Forbidden City. material. At that time, various academic institutions were very friendly to students looking for information. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Talk about academics&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>; Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Before 1980, three international seminars on the history of Chinese legal system were held in the world, but mainland China was not invited in any of them.

What do you think about this? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Once Mr. Zhang gave us a lecture and mentioned the Chinese legal system of scholars from other countries His historical academic achievements exceed those of local Chinese scholars, and even international academic seminars on related topics have not even been attended by Chinese scholars. From the perspective of academic responsibility, Mr. Wang hopes that we will work hard to change the status quo and firmly place the center of Chinese legal history research in China&#39;s local academic community. We were deeply touched by the words of Mr. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; There is a voice that believes that compared with departmental law, legal history has less say in reality. However, some scholars believe that true history must contribute to reality and history must participate in the social process. What are your thoughts? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Concerning historical research, diversity in purposes and methods should be allowed. You can focus on connecting with reality, or you can focus on academics themselves. I have seen that some doctoral students always think about how to directly guide reality when deciding on a thesis topic. I encourage students’ innovation, but I also tell them that a scholar’s ​​task is to do academic work first and clarify academic issues. The formulation and implementation of ancient laws had specific background conditions in ancient society. The connection with reality must be appropriate and logical, and cannot be too far-fetched. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I have a similar experience myself. When a publication requests a manuscript, I send it in, and the editor sends back expert review comments. Experts suggested that I should base my article on the views I proposed and make some connections with contemporary social reality. I replied to the editor and said that my interest lies in talking about academics and history. The editor was very understanding and accepted my comments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Scholars may be able to distinguish There are two types of people, one is doing pure learning in an ivory tower, and the other is caring about reality. Should you be the former? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think the value of a scholar lies in the academic itself. My research is generally not directly related to connected with reality. We can sort out the development process of legal systems and legal theories in Chinese history in detail, and put forward our own opinions on their laws, characteristics, and functions. If we can reproduce their true state and show their true role in the process of national management and social governance, our academic goal will be accomplished. As for whether this research result can play a role in contemporary national governance and rule of law construction, I believe readers are smart enough to sort through it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Research in the humanities is often related to scholars’ real-life encounters and life experiences, and is very personal.

Even if they join the queue for 4 years, the material conditions are poor and the labor intensity is high. But during those 4 years, there were no unpleasant feelings. In current terms, I am basically satisfied with the status quo. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From 1977 to 1987, I studied continuously for 10 years and experienced three options: undergraduate, master&#39;s and doctoral examinations. These three road choices were not too difficult.如果难度大，当时也许就退缩了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Self-evaluation, my academic research is not very critical and not creative enough. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;From &quot;master-apprentice system&quot; to &quot;teacher-student system&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left ;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How has the current graduate education changed compared to the era when you were studying? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When we were studying, it was a more typical &quot;master-apprentice system&quot;. It is similar to the way a master leads an apprentice in a traditional social handicraft workshop. It is characterized by personalized guidance and comprehensive training. Mr. Zhang can give us personalized guidance and comprehensive training according to his own positioning and expectations for young scholars. The content of guidance varies from person to person and students are taught in accordance with their aptitude. At the same time, we pay attention to comprehensive training. Mr. Xiang gives us detailed guidance in all aspects of academic research, including reading lists, thesis topic selection, data screening, condensation of ideas, thesis structure, and written expression. It also covers many aspects of social interaction and dealing with people outside of academia. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The &quot;master-apprentice&quot; training method is more conducive to teaching students in accordance with their aptitude, but it cannot solve the problem of large-scale education. After the expansion of postgraduate enrollment, the &quot;teacher-student system&quot; in which teachers lead students was gradually developed and improved. Its characteristic is that it pays more attention to standardized training and digital management in the education process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;With Mr. Zhang You have similar experiences. Since 2001, you have served as the vice president and dean of the graduate school of China University of Political Science and Law for nearly 14 years.

For example, whether they are doctoral students or master&#39;s students, during the six-semester training process, there are unified regulations in the training plan on which books students should read, which classes they should listen to, and which teaching links they must complete. How many credits should a doctoral student complete, how many courses should be taken, how many reading reports, term papers, and academic papers should be submitted, how many days of social practice should be carried out, how many academic papers should be formally published in journals of what level, and the number of dissertations should reach tens of thousands. Words, etc., all have clear numerical regulations. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The advantage of standardized training and digital management is that the training results can be evaluated and the training process can be monitored, especially those that can effectively adapt to the large-scale education of graduate students.

More than one doctoral student. In the training process of doctoral students, some &quot;master-apprenticeship&quot; habits are retained to a certain extent. The students I recruit have undergraduate and master&#39;s degree education backgrounds in law, history, and Chinese. To train them, in addition to completing quantitative prescribed actions, it is necessary to make up for the missing knowledge structure. Some students have good reading and research abilities, but lack social interaction. For these students, their shortcomings also need to be addressed in a targeted manner. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Today&#39;s students are very anxious, introverted, and worried about finding an ideal job.

Personal career development requires both good self-quality and suitable external opportunities. There is no need to say more about the cultivation and improvement of self-quality. How to face external opportunities, based on my own experience and understanding of life, I have given advice to my students: be proactive and be content with the situation. When planning your career blueprint, if you face multiple opportunities, you should be proactive, design the best plan, and strive for the best choice. When there are few opportunities to choose and it is very difficult to change the status quo, you should cherish the present and take things as they come. In different positions, if you do your job well, you can also show your talents and achieve success. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[预防糖尿病，摆脱“甜蜜负担”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260553]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-14 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;Today is the annual &quot;World Diabetes Day&quot;.

There is a word &quot;bitter summer&quot; in Japanese that specifically describes the scorching summer heat. Even if you cannot fully understand its original meaning, the single Chinese word &quot;bitter&quot; can already convey the meaning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/WsZh4SZI60RS60TPLMVRINpXpRxZuFCDHCT7edrx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/WsZh4SZI60RS60TPLMVRINpXpRxZuFCDHCT7edrx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258160&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On the Tokyo Imperial Palace running route, there are facilities designed to cool down runners. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Chen Xi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last time I came to Japan was in 2019. If the epidemic has changed anything, I hate it the most. Runners have started running, and running on the streets of Tokyo is itself a mark of the epidemic. At the height of the epidemic, all sports venues in Beijing were closed. I couldn&#39;t hold it in anymore, so I ordered my first pair of running shoes online and started running along the empty streets. From barely finishing 3 kilometers, to the joy of running 5 kilometers for the first time, to completing 10 kilometers and half marathon, although it may not be worth mentioning among the huge running community, it is a small achievement for me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Running also gives me a new perspective on a place. Familiar places have new experiences because of running. In turn, this sense of strangeness also makes every small &quot;tribulation&quot; more enjoyable.

He wrote in &quot;What do I talk about when I talk about running&quot; &quot;Specially mentioned in the book; if you want to run at a higher pace, or complete interval running exercises &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (a high-intensity and low-intensity Cross-intensity running exercises can help improve runners&#39; ability to resist lactic acid)&lt;/span>;, you can go to the Yoyogi Park track and field to try your skills. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While doing my homework, I also learned that Tokyo has complete supporting facilities for runners. Near the most popular route around the Imperial Palace, there are several hotels where runners can store bags, bathe, and change clothes. The service station only charges a fee equivalent to 30 to 40 yuan, and you can also rent sportswear, running shoes, running pockets and other equipment. You have decided to experience it before setting off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;来到东京第二天便特意起了个大早，坐地铁前往事先查到的一家跑者服务站。这家服务站和餐厅开在一起，由于收费不高，跑者服务站通常采用混业经营的方式，让跑步的人留下来吃个早餐，或者把服务站直接开在著名运动品牌的店铺里，增加客源，拉动销售，都是多年运营后，服务站经营者想出来的办法。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这家服务站装饰朴素，却有着日本式的干净实用。前台的姑娘不善英语，手边也没有任何英语说明，看得出这里的客人以日本当地人为主，很少接待游客。比比划划，来意并不难懂，我付了钱，领了钥匙和毛巾，剩下的就完全自助了。后来我去的另一家服务站装潢明显高档一些，两家收费差不多，而且都能办月卡，月卡价格基本是三次单买的价格，非常划算。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第二家服务站还和运动品牌合作，有一墙不同鞋码的美津浓跑鞋，一墙Salomon竞速路跑鞋。美津浓的跑鞋可以免费使用，Salomon的那款鞋价格较高，国内售价要2000元，也只需象征性交100日元&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（约5元人民币）&lt;/span>;便可试用。因为体验上佳，我差点因为100日元的试用动了自己买一双的念头，看来这种试用的确是一种高明的销售手段，而且销售场景非常精准。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;只有亲自体验一下这条线，才知道为什么它是东京跑步线路第一名。其实也是无奈之举。作为人口稠密、寸土寸金的国际都市，东京核心区的跑步条件实在有限，路网密集导致红绿灯很多，街道狭窄就连绿化也做得相当克制，很难见到成排的大树。所以皇居周边的护城河及茂密植被，以及环城一周没有间断的五公里“跑道”，则成为热爱跑步的东京人不二之选。环皇居线还有相对起伏不大、公共交通便利的优势。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;沿着作家的道路跑着，却没有灵感迸发。作家也很诚实，说跑步的时候大多是胡思乱想，甚至把自己当成一个没有感情的跑步机器就好了。世界上知名作家很多，坚韧的跑者更不少，但兼而有之且为大众熟悉的，似乎只有村上春树。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;日本出了这么一位热爱跑步的知名作家其来有自。长跑在日本属于国民性的运动，上百年对长跑的推广和发展，让日本的跑者覆盖各个年龄层次，基数大、水平高，可以类比中国的乒乓球或者美国的篮球。世界六大马拉松赛中，东京马拉松被称为“民补”多过“官补”的赛事，人们自发为参赛选手提供沿途免费补给，数量竟然比赛事承办方准备的补给站还多。东京人的热情也与本土选手超强的实力有关，经常能有数名本土选手跑进2小时10分的大关，这一成绩与世界顶尖的东非运动员不分高下。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;马拉松赛事在国内近十年的发展也是如火如荼，如果经常阅览赛事报名app，每个月都能找到参赛的地方，有时候只恨分身乏术。如果说国内马拉松赛事和世界“六大”有什么差距的话，其实更多是文化层面的，而形成文化别无他途，唯有时间。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据美国日本学家托马斯·黑文斯（Thomas Havens）追溯，1912年日本派出两名选手参加瑞典斯德哥尔摩奥运会马拉松项目，可被称为马拉松运动在日本的起点。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当时的日本政府财力有限，只能选派两名运动员参加奥运会。马拉松这个项目与江户时代末期零星举办的长距离赛跑活动十分相似，这些赛事的目的是“提高全民的身体素质”，并且表明日本人可以在西方的类似比赛中获得自己的地位。这种融合了国家自豪感、现代化证明与积极参与国际竞争态度的驱动力，正是同期明治维新的遗产。一个著名的例子是，1901年在东京不忍池周围的狭窄赛道上，举行了一场热闹的12小时跑步耐力赛，吸引了一百多名参赛者，其中15人完成了71圈&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（103.6公里）&lt;/span>;。所以，最后参加1912年奥运会的两名日本选手中，就有一名是马拉松运动员。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;早在1920至1930年代，日本人已经跻身于世界最快马拉松成绩缔造者之列。二战以后，经过几十年的休养生息，1960至1980年代，日本马拉松运动员在世界上回到了统治级地位，1966年世界排行榜的前17强成绩，有15个是日本男子选手创造的。到了1990年代，日本女子马拉松运动员开始在比赛中拔得头筹。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/eGqKlFUPUY3mB92p0O1ho9fWKjEsLzTttbo2qd38.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;2018年，小说《强风吹拂》的同名电视剧在日本上映，这个以箱根驿传为背景，讲述一支杂牌大学长跑队通过魔鬼训练，在比赛中逆袭的热血体育故事，让更多人认识了这场日本体育盛事。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;箱根驿传的创办者正是前面提到的，日本派出参加斯德哥尔摩奥运会的马拉松选手之一金栗四三。金栗四三的第一次马拉松奥运之旅可谓惨痛，当时日本以全国之力把他和另一名短跑运动员送到奥运会赛场上，两名运动员每人的旅费相当于名校早稻田大学三十六年的学费。但全国人民的期待和舟车劳顿把他压垮了，比赛当天酷热异常，甚至有一名葡萄牙运动员倒地身亡，而金栗四三在途中也失去意识，被当地农户抬回家中，醒来已是第二天比赛结束后。他后来还参加过两次奥运会，最好成绩是第16名。现在往回看，这三十六年名牌大学学费成本的回报过于丰厚，金栗四三成了日本马拉松发展的领路人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1920年，第一届箱根驿传在早稻田大学、明治大学等四所高校间展开，除去两次世界大战时停办，至今已举办99届，2024年将是这项比赛的百年盛事。箱根驿传为日本马拉松运动提供了大量的世界级运动员，其中中国跑步爱好者最熟悉的大迫杰，因外貌俊秀、跑姿优雅，俘获了大批粉丝，他就曾是箱根驿传中早稻田大学的精英跑手，至今仍是日本国内马拉松记录保持者。现役的大学生跑者很多是家喻户晓的明星，人们像追星一样搭乘火车提前奔赴观赛点，在新年的寒风中等待数个小时，终点更是会有上万名观众守候，“恭喜”、“辛苦了”、“你已经很棒了”，随着选手一个个通过终点，这样的呐喊声此起彼伏。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;只要对马拉松的成绩稍有概念，浏览每年箱根驿传分段成绩简直令人咋舌，尤其2023年，多个赛段尘封已久的纪录被打破。有人在“知乎”上提问，如果在中国选出最优秀的十名业余长跑选手组队，而且不局限于大学生，能不能进箱根驿传的前十，答案令人遗憾，经过同等距离换算后，这支队伍只能获得同年箱根驿传的第15名。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后引用一个数据，2012年11月23至25日，全日本一共举办了六场全程马拉松比赛，一共有77772名选手完成比赛，六场中的五场完赛率超过90%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/SncyVY9nj9L27yumGNuBesGoiIbrQ7FFHFrVsbGy.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/SncyVY9nj9L27yumGNuBesGoiIbrQ7FFHFrVsbGy.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;长距离跑步比赛枯燥而艰苦，1990年代在国内中长跑项目上引领一时的“马家军”，吸纳的队员大都来自中小城市普通家庭，依靠拼搏努力、能吃苦，通过运动成绩在社会上赢得一席之地。但马拉松在日本一开始就是精英运动。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;箱根驿传首先在包括早稻田大学等四所名校间展开，作为民族崛起、国家主义的一部分，这些精英大学生成为当仁不让的主力。这种基因贯穿了日本马拉松近一百年的发展，至今日本的名牌大学仍在为马拉松运动源源不断地输送着年轻力量，这些大学生毕业后通常会进入日本知名企业，加入由企业赞助的专业跑团，代表企业参加国内外各种赛事，为企业争光。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前面提到的大迫杰从早稻田大学毕业后，就加入了日清实业跑团。但加入企业跑团意味着一切以企业利益至上，企业甚至会要求运动员牺牲奥运会等国际大赛的备赛时间，以日本国内赛事优先。所以包括大迫杰在内的很多顶尖选手为了主导自己的运动生涯，最终选择从企业跑团退出。大迫杰退出日清实业，加入由耐克赞助的俄勒冈计划后，日本社会上还有很多呼其“叛徒”的声音，但随着他在国际赛场上获得一次次极为优秀的战绩，这些批评已经成为了过去式。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;谈到日本马拉松运动从国家主导到市场主导的过程，躲不开一个人——日本前首相中曾根康弘。无论对中国还是日本，中曾根康弘都是极富争议的人物，他曾以军官身份参与过侵华战争，但在中国改革开放初期，又极力促成日本给当时的中国出口贸易提供金融担保，没有日本的担保，以当时中国的经济状况获得国际贷款融资更会难上加难。他曾参观靖国神社，后来又为日本侵华战争道歉。但如果深挖其人物内核，会发现这都源自于他的实用主义。他曾说：“当被问及你在战后民主主义中做了什么，我可以回答，我拼命地努力开发了符合大众民主主义时代的政治手段，其秘籍的专利属于我。”作为迎合民意的高手，他在首相任期内完成了日本“国铁分割国有化”，把曾属于日本国家垄断企业的日本国铁拆了，以公司化的方式运营，现在去日本旅行常看到的“JR东日本”、“JR西日本”、“JR北海道”等等，都是日本国铁拆分出来的公司。按照中曾根康弘的实用主义，这些都是他迎合民意的一部分，正如他所说，当时的日本已经处于一个大众民主主义时代，而他推动了这一切更快发生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在这场私有化大潮中，本来属于日本国家主导的运动事业也逐渐交给了市场。 1970年代，曾经认为商业会腐蚀体育精神的日本业余体育协会（JASA），开始允许奥运会选手出现在电视广告中，收到的费用由运动员所在企业和JASA分成。广告巨头电通公司1979年组织了一场“日本出发”活动，以支持次年的莫斯科奥运会。这种大企业赞助体育赛事的行为在1980年代更为流行，运动员的收入也水涨船高。 1991年日本房地产泡沫破裂后，政府财政进一步吃紧，体育事业的市场化被加快，为此日本政府还制定了一系列的税收奖励政策。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在这一系列的历史背景下，马拉松运动从1912年日本寄望于在世界产生影响的体育项目，经过一百年的发展，逐渐完成了商业化。这也是世界体育发展的潮流和趋势：通过商业的方式，吸引全民的兴趣和社会资本，在群众运动基础上选拔顶尖人才。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2007年，东京都政府战胜了马拉松精英赛事的既得利益者商业财团，也抚平了东京警察局对马拉松会极大扰乱都市秩序的担忧，由政府出资举办了首届东京马拉松比赛。现在，东京马拉松比赛已经是世界六大国际马拉松赛事之一，要知道“六大”之一的波士顿马拉松始于1897年。东京马拉松为城市带来了巨大影响力和商业收益&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（每年超过1.5亿美元）&lt;/span>;，成为日本各地政府争相模仿的对象，大阪马拉松、神户马拉松、横滨马拉松、北海道马拉松，如今都已成为国内外参与者众多、每次都需要抽签才能报名的赛事。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/fiLBn71yrJJIKEVF2OVbgeeWHlXkdpxRdCc4gfza.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;622&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/fiLBn71yrJJIKEVF2OVbgeeWHlXkdpxRdCc4gfza.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258162&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;在东京来一场有氧慢跑&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（视觉中国/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，一场巨大的政府与商业的成功合谋，必定提供了某种社会必需品。在日本经济“失去的三十年”中，长跑成为鼓舞民族精神的方式，更是解决心灵困境的解药。这种解药既作用于身体，生产出令人愉悦的多巴胺、内啡肽，打造出应付高强度现代生活的健康体魄，又作用于精神，应对物质极大繁荣、缺乏生活磨难后的空虚。就像村上春树最喜欢的那句：痛楚难以避免，而磨难可以选择（Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional）。他说，“真正有价值的东西，往往通过效率甚低的营生方能获得。即便这是虚妄的行为，也绝不是愚蠢的行为。我如此认为，作为切实的感受作为经验法则。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总之，每一位喜爱跑步的人，都可以参考村上春树为自己设计的墓志铭：“他至少是跑到了最后。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
