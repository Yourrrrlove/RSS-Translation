Zhoukou China Unicom stated that provincial and municipal companies have set up special work teams to investigate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a report on the Henan TV Metropolis Channel program, a fired China Unicom engineer revealed to the program that in order to force users to replace optical modems, Zhoukou China Unicom Company would first stop users’ broadband accounts in the background, and then come to visit engineers. They will falsely claim that &quot;the optical modem is damaged&quot; and require the user to replace the device, charging 299 yuan. After replacing the optical modem, restore user network services from the background. This China Unicom engineer said that when installing computers for new users, China Unicom Zhoukou Company will also use the old optical modems replaced by other users to install computers for the new users. After the new users have used them for a period of time, the engineers will come to the door and tell them that the optical modem model is too old. &quot;No longer matches&quot;, the user will be asked to reinstall Sunbeam Cat. The engineer also said that starting from June 2023, Zhoukou China Unicom requires each engineer to complete terminal replacement tasks for 10 households per month. Because he failed to complete the task, the company unilaterally terminated the labor contract without any compensation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It seems that this engineer chose to reveal the &quot;shady story&quot; of China Unicom because he was dissatisfied with being fired. This incident involves two different issues. One is a labor contract dispute. Whether it is reasonable to assign marketing tasks to technical staff, and whether it is legal to dismiss employees because they cannot complete the tasks, this issue can be resolved through the labor dispute resolution mechanism, resorting to labor arbitration or the court. Regardless of whether the engineer is a regular employee who has directly signed a labor contract with China Unicom, or is dispatched to China Unicom through a labor dispatch company, his legitimate rights and interests should be safeguarded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another question, which is more related to the public interest, is whether China Unicom has used technical means to force users to replace optical modems. If this question is true, it is very bad and suspected of fraud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the fired engineer’s revelations, in order to force users to replace optical modems, China Unicom Zhoukou would first stop users’ broadband in the background, preventing users from accessing the Internet, creating the illusion of a network failure. After the user reported the problem, they lied that the optical modem was broken and asked the user to pay for a new optical modem. After the replacement, the broadband was restored. It looked like the fault was repaired after the optical modem was replaced. For new users, they will deliberately use the old optical modem during installation. After a period of time, they will ask the user to replace it with a new one on the grounds that the optical modem does not match. Otherwise, they will not be able to access the Internet normally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is undoubtedly a serious accusation. Compared with ordinary users, operators have absolute technological and information advantages. When broadband fails, ordinary users have no way of knowing the specific cause and can only rely on operators. It is very bad if operators rely on information advantages to defraud users, charge users, or achieve other goals. The deputy director of the office of Zhoukou China Unicom said that if you disconnect the Internet privately, induce users to change terminals, and maliciously charge fees, it is an illegal operation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If this matter is true, I am afraid it is not just a violation of regulations. First of all, this violates the service contract with the user and is a breach of contract. Users sign a broadband service contract with a telecom operator, and the operator is obliged to do its best to provide stable and up-to-standard broadband communication services. If a fault occurs, it should be repaired as soon as possible. If there is no fault in the first place, using technical means to create the illusion of a fault in order to achieve one&#39;s own goals, which prevents users from accessing the Internet smoothly, is undoubtedly a serious malicious act and is a fraudulent act. In addition, users are also charged a fee for exchanging bare cats. Although the amount per household is not much, the more users there are, the more the total amount is. Using fraudulent means to defraud others of property may constitute a crime of fraud if certain standards are met. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, whether this allegation is true remains to be investigated by the relevant departments. Nowadays, the communication control system in the operator&#39;s backend is very complete, and every operation will be recorded in the log, so it is not difficult to find out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to media reports, there are indeed complaints about &quot;forced replacement of optical modems&quot; on the consumer complaint platform, and some of them directly name the Unicom branch in Henan Province. Some netizens who claim to be veteran employees in the communications industry said that this kind of behavior is the default &quot;hidden rule&quot; in the industry. If customers insist on not changing terminals, the company will reduce the Internet speed. In fact, this behavior not only exists among telecom operators, but also among Internet companies. An Internet giant that provides email services once &quot;interfered&quot; with users who used other email clients to receive their own emails, making them more likely to receive garbled emails in order to induce users to download and use their own email clients. This has even been regarded as a successful marketing case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No matter what the reason is, telecom operators want users to update their optical modems and other communication equipment. They should use incentives to attract users to voluntarily update. For example, users who replace optical modems can be upgraded to a higher network for free. Wait. It is difficult to achieve goals by setting KPI indicators for engineers. If the pressure to complete the indicators is too great, engineers may &quot;find another way&quot; to complete the task through non-compliant means, harming the interests of consumers. Some telecom operators have been exposed to malicious &quot;competition&quot; methods such as deliberately cutting off competitors&#39; optical fibers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No matter how fierce the market competition is, work tasks should not be completed in a way that harms the interests of consumers. In response to the Zhoukou Unicom incident, the Henan Provincial Communications Administration Bureau has intervened in the investigation and conducted the first interview with Zhoukou Unicom. The management department should find out the relevant situation as soon as possible. If the situation in the revelations does exist, China Unicom should be severely punished to safeguard the interests of consumers and prevent operators from defrauding consumers by relying on asymmetric information and technological advantages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 26 Nov 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[监督“八小时之外”：红黄橙三色如何管住干部]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261351]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-26 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 12, 2023, the website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the State Supervision Commission published a report titled &quot;&quot; &quot;Besides eight hours, we must control it!&quot; article.

(Photo source: &quot;China Discipline Inspection and Supervision News&quot;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The three colors of red, yellow and orange have another use. In Wucheng District, Jinhua City, Zhejiang Province, they have become a way to supervise cadres &quot;eight hours away&quot; means. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2023, a department-level cadre in Wucheng District was assigned a &quot;red code&quot; for management because he made mistakes in his life style. The cadre had an inappropriate relationship with others and was later reported by his family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Hong, director of the Cadre Supervision Office of the Wucheng District Party Committee Organization Department, said that the cadre was transferred from his original post after the incident and his position was demoted from a principal position to a deputy position. Its file information has been given a &quot;red code&quot; in the cadre supervision and management system and has become a key supervision object. Unless the &quot;red code&quot; in the system is lifted, the cadre&#39;s rank and position cannot be promoted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This mechanism is the &quot;red, yellow and orange three-color management&quot; system, which is an important part of Wucheng District&#39;s eight-hour supervision and management method for leading cadres. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2015, starting with Guangdong Province, many places have issued opinions on the supervision and management of &quot;eight-hour outing&quot; activities of leading cadres, and some government agencies have also formulated implementation plans. On September 12, 2023, the website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the State Supervisory Commission published an article titled &quot;Beyond Eight Hours,&quot; We Must Control It! &quot; article emphasized the importance of supervising leading cadres&#39; &quot;eight hours away activities&quot;. Six days later, another article was published titled &quot;Refined and practical supervision and management to ensure the &quot;eight hours away&quot;&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of Peng Xinlin, director of the International Anti-Corruption Education and Research Center of Beijing Normal University, this is an important means to strengthen the construction of party style and clean government and the fight against corruption. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;3 circles, 21 items not allowed&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2023, two cadres in Wucheng District were coded for &quot;drinking&quot; manage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A cadre of the Discipline Inspection Commission went home from work and drank alcohol during the working day, and was discovered by the disciplinary inspection and supervision department during a temporary inspection. Because he violated the rule of &quot;no drinking during working days&quot;, he was reminded to talk and given a &quot;yellow code&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another cadre got into an argument with someone in the community after drinking, and the other party called the police. Because his behavior damaged the image of party members and cadres, he was admonished and given an &quot;orange code.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Specifically, during the eight-hour supervision process, &quot;red codes&quot; were assigned to cadres who had caused serious consequences or were suspected of violating laws and disciplines; &quot;yellow codes&quot; were assigned to cadres with symptoms and tendencies. cadres; those involved in minor disciplinary violations will be assigned an &quot;orange code.&quot; According to the color of the code, cadres will be transferred to the Discipline Inspection Commission, reminded to speak, and letters of advice and admonitions will be dealt with to varying degrees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The inspiration for this mechanism is actually traffic lights, which were first used in village cadre management.&quot; Qian Hong said that there is a &quot;three-color management&quot; interface in the local organization department cadre supervision and management system, which can be viewed The situation of assigned cadres. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for what behaviors cadres are not allowed to do outside of eight hours, the &quot;Measures for the Supervision and Management of &quot;Eight Hours Outside&quot; Activities of Leading Cadres of Wucheng District, Jinhua City are listed in detail. This management method is governed by the District Commission for Discipline Inspection and the District Jointly issued by the Organization Department of the Committee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are 21 prohibited behaviors, which are divided into social circle, life circle and rest circle. Each circle has 7 items. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behaviors that are not allowed in social circles include not adhering to party principles and making irresponsible remarks on the central government&#39;s policies; forming cliques and forming &quot;small circles&quot; through activities such as sororities, fellows&#39; associations, classmates&#39; associations, comrades-in-arms associations, etc., or There is no distinction between relatives and pure people, and there is collusion between officials and businessmen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first prohibited behavior in the life circle is to condone and acquiesce in spouses, children and children&#39;s spouses violating regulations to run businesses and engage in profit-making activities. The behavior of having improper sexual relations with others is on the same level as blind comparison and pursuit of vulgar taste. In addition, violating family ethics and failing to respect and support parents are not allowed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eating and drinking with public funds, traveling with public funds, entertainment with public funds, and using public cars for private use are not allowed in the leisure circle. In the leisure circle, another thing that is not allowed is using one&#39;s authority to act as a protective umbrella for illegal activities or evil forces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The extent to which a specific behavior is serious enough to be &quot;coded&quot; must be determined based on the actual situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Hong used &quot;participating in a banquet for management service recipients&quot; as an example. If the banquet for management service recipients is not reported, at least a yellow code must be assigned; if the meal money is paid by the management service recipient, that is Orange code; if you use your authority to provide some economic convenience to the other party during this period, a warning or a serious warning or above will be given, a red code will be assigned. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Qian Hong’s view, no matter what kind of coding mechanism is essentially not a punishment system, but a cadre management system, “It’s not that cadres who committed crimes in the past There is no punishment system for mistakes, but instead of just settling the matter, problem cadres are managed as key targets to make the management of party members and cadres more standardized.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Hong also noticed that there are &quot;eight problems&quot; within the system There are concerns that supervision after hours may infringe on personal privacy and affect normal interpersonal interactions.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;When we issued the document, we explained to everyone that the supervision of the &quot;eight-hour outing&quot; activities of leading cadres will protect personal privacy within the scope of the law and will not affect their legitimate interpersonal interactions and spare time life. For example, having a meal with family and friends or going out to play, situations like this are not within the scope of our supervision.&quot; Qian Hong told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From advocacy to implementation&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After the implementation of the coding system, one day in August 2023, Qian Hong received an &quot;angry &quot;Ms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She went to report her husband, a department-level cadre in a township in Wucheng District. The couple were both over fifty years old. She had previously suspected that her husband had inappropriate relationships with other women, but she had no evidence. This time she checked her husband&#39;s mobile phone while he was sleeping and confirmed the fact that her husband had cheated on her through chat records and transfer records. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Hong asked her why she went to the organization department to report first. Her answer was that in July 2023, the Wucheng District Party Committee Organization Department took the lead in launching a &quot;double advancement&quot; campaign, and she knew that she could go to the Organization Department if she had any opinions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Double entry&quot; means that in order to fully understand and grasp the &quot;eight hours away&quot; situation of party members and cadres, the District Party Committee Organization Department extends the supervision and management of cadres from &quot;unit compounds&quot; to &quot;community courtyards&quot; and &quot;families&quot; backyard&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, &quot;the concept of &#39;eight-hour supervision&#39; was first mentioned by local leaders 20 years ago, and later gradually became a popular saying.&quot; Zhuang Deshui, deputy director of the Integrity Construction Research Center of Peking University, introduced that in the early days , this concept appeared more in the speeches and reports of some leaders. Later, some places introduced some relevant bans and regulations, but most of them were advocacy and lacked specific implementation agencies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public information shows that around 2001, the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China launched a pilot study of cadres’ living circles and social circles in Huzhou, Zhejiang. In 2004, the Organization Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee formulated and issued the &quot;Opinions on Implementing the Inspection of the Living and Social Circles of Leading Cadres&quot;, which stipulated that officials&#39; mahjong and gambling in their spare time, neighborhood relations, and the composition of their friend circles would all be included in the inspection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guangdong Province was the first place to elevate &quot;eight-hour supervision&quot; to the level of rules and regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2014, after the Eighth Inspection Team of the Central Committee inspected Guangdong, it was recommended to strengthen the daily management of party members and leading cadres and the supervision of activities &quot;outside eight hours&quot;. In August 2015, the Guangdong Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection, the Organization Department of the Provincial Party Committee, and the Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security jointly issued the &quot;Opinions on Strengthening the Supervision and Management of &quot;Beyond Eight Hours&quot; Activities of Party Members and Leading Cadres&quot;. , supervision mechanisms are clearly stipulated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, Guangdong selected 147 pilot units across the province, including Yantian District of Shenzhen, to explore and trial the supervision and management of activities of leading cadres &quot;outside eight hours&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, the then Secretary of the Yantian District Committee of Shenzhen City wrote an article in the &quot;Study Times&quot; introducing that Yantian District established a list of (negative) reports on &quot;three circles&quot; issues, community supervision, contact with cadres&#39; families, and eight A series of supervision mechanisms such as linking extra-hour activities with selection and appointment, and integrity assessment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public information shows that in the past six years, including Wucheng District of Jinhua City, Zhejiang Province, Pinghu City, Zhejiang Province (a county-level city under the jurisdiction of Jiaxing City), Fengxin County, Jiangxi Province, Zhijiang City, Hubei Province, and Qixian County, Henan Province , Youxian District of Mianyang City in Sichuan Province, Jianning County of Fujian Province and other places formulated the &quot;Eight-hour Oversight Supervision Implementation Measures for Leading Cadres&quot;. The specific content also has many similarities with the relevant mechanisms in Yantian District. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pinghu City&#39;s &quot;system for contacting cadres&#39; families&quot; is mainly responsible for the Cadre Supervision Office of the Organization Department of the Pinghu Municipal Party Committee. &quot;We are used to calling it a &#39;home visit&#39;, during which we will focus on listening to some indicative and tendentious content.&quot; .&quot; said Gan Keyi, deputy director of the Cadre Supervision Office. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As soon as Gan Ke remembered, during a &quot;home visit&quot;, a family member complained that his &quot;other half&quot; rarely ate at home from Monday to Friday, and the home visit team asked him if he ate at work. The cadre said that sometimes he worked overtime and sometimes he went out to socialize. The home visiting team then asked about the specific entertainment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In response to this situation, we will verify through multiple channels. If we find that some entertainment may affect the performance of our duties, we will take further measures.&quot; Gan Keyi introduced that after verification by the Organization Department , and did not find that the cadre&#39;s entertainment affected his performance of duties, he had a separate conversation with him and did not make any other treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mobilizing community forces to supervise the activities of cadres outside eight hours is also a method commonly adopted in various places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pinghu City has set up three categories of &quot;eight-hour outside supervision and observation points&quot;: Category A is located in municipal agencies and departments, Category B is located in townships and streets, and Category C is located in communities and village-level units. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Gan Keyi, about 90% of the leading cadres in Pinghu City live in the main urban area. They have set up two community supervisors in each of the 21 communities where cadres live relatively densely. Generally, they are led by highly respected local officials. , social figures with high political quality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Community supervisors play the role of information collectors. They only need to collect and feedback information. As for the authenticity of the information, the basic verification work is the responsibility of the B-type supervision point.&quot; Gan Keyi said, related After the implementation of the mechanism, a supervisor reported to the town street supervision point that a cadre living in the community caused a neighborhood dispute due to illegal stacking of debris in the corridor. Finally, it was verified and confirmed by the town street supervision point, and the organization department gave a reminder. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A deputy division-level cadre from a northwest province expressed his recognition of the community supervision mechanism to Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;If it can be truly implemented, it should still be very effective.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;In his opinion, community security guards can also consider hiring community supervisors. &quot;Although they may not necessarily live in the community, they have no clue which leader comes back after drinking too much every day.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 >;&quot;One vote veto&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the process of exploring the &quot;eight-hour out-of-hours&quot; supervision of leading cadres, in order to ensure the effectiveness of supervision, supervisory departments in many places will combine the &quot;eight-hour out-of-hours&quot; supervision situation with the selection and appointment of cadres, The unit leadership team is linked to accountability for performance of duties and unit assessment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The relevant implementation measures issued by Youxian District of Mianyang City, Sichuan in 2020 require that the personal &quot;eight hours&quot; of party members and cadres and their performance of supervision and management responsibilities shall be used as the basis for cadre selection and appointment, rank promotion, and performance appraisal. An important part of the evaluation and annual assessment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wucheng District of Jinhua City also has similar regulations. Qian Hong introduced that the connection between the results of eight-hour supervision and party disciplinary sanctions will directly affect the promotion of leading cadres. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Hong gave an example: Those who have been severely warned within the party shall not be promoted within one and a half years, those who have been warned by the party must not be promoted within one year, and those who have been warned and spoken shall not be promoted within six months. In addition, the results of party discipline will also affect the year-end bonus of cadres to varying degrees. Once they are severely warned, the bonus will be reset to zero. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the implementation measures of various places, intra-party supervision is the primary supervision method. Party committees at all levels have the main responsibility for the supervision and management of party members and cadres in their respective regions, systems, and units &quot;outside eight hours&quot;. The party committee secretary He is the first person responsible for holding accountable the leadership team and cadres who fail to perform their duties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gan Keyi told a case: a cadre of a unit in Pinghu City was included in the &quot;red list&quot; due to a problem eight hours away. Due to issues such as insufficient timely collection of after-hours supervision information and insufficient reminders to the unit&#39;s cadres, the organization&#39;s officers were also admonished and included in the &quot;yellow list.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;red and yellow list&quot; is similar to the coding mechanism in Wucheng District. Being included in the &quot;red list&quot; means that the cadre has been investigated and investigated by the Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision, while the &quot;yellow list&quot; shows that the cadre is suspected of committing crimes. There are many tendency issues, and the organization department needs to intervene early to understand the situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We can’t wait until the Discipline Inspection Commission has opened a case for investigation and the public security has notified us before reporting.” Qian Hong said that the unit’s party group failed to fulfill its main responsibilities, and eventually something went wrong. The assessment of the unit’s party style and clean government construction will be affected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In terms of cadre supervision, when it comes to issues related to integrity, self-discipline and life style, we will deduct points very severely, which is almost equivalent to a veto. If a member of the leadership team of this unit has made a mistake this year, If there is a problem, we will push it to the last level.&quot; Qian Hong told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there is no clear explanation in the relevant measures from various places on how to measure the effect of eight-hour supervision. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gan Keyi said frankly that at present, to measure the effectiveness of supervision outside eight hours, it still depends on whether leading cadres can regulate themselves outside eight hours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Eight-hour supervision is not to deal with cadres, but to protect cadres, prevent small problems from turning into big problems, and nip big problems in their bud.&quot; Gan Keyi said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the supervision of &quot;top leaders&quot; has always been a difficulty in anti-corruption. &quot;China Discipline Inspection and Supervision News&quot; pointed out in an article analyzing &quot;How to manage &#39;eight hours away&#39;?&quot; that the supervision of top leaders is often due to the fact that superior supervision is too far away, peer supervision is too soft, and subordinate supervision is too difficult. Facing the dilemma of ineffective supervision. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;That&#39;s true. This aspect is a little more difficult. In the end, superiors are in charge of subordinates.&quot; Qian Hong said frankly. Gan Keyi also discovered that compared with supervising ordinary cadres, there are some particularities in how to supervise the activities of &quot;top leaders&quot; outside eight hours. &quot;From a social perspective, the &#39;top leaders&#39; will involve communication with some merchants and brother units. Sometimes they participate in some entertainment. In this process, it is indeed difficult to distinguish whether the entertainment is for business or private.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It is often possible for them to supervise others, but it is more difficult for them to accept supervision themselves. It’s difficult.” Zhuang Deshui recalled that a cadre once expressed a “relatively pessimistic” attitude to him, believing that supervision eight hours away was useless. “Many things cannot be effectively supervised, and the real corruption is under the table.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some grassroots cadres are also worried about the durability and effectiveness of the policy. &quot;I&#39;m afraid that after a period of strict implementation, it will be loosened. (As time goes by) there are policies at the top and countermeasures at the bottom.&quot; Qian Hong said that even now, some problems have caused trouble for the eight-hour supervision. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, he gave the example that some cadres would avoid places that are the focus of regulatory authorities and go to more private places; although there is community supervision, some cadres may have houses in several communities or even other urban areas; In terms of family supervision, some cadres have a bad relationship with husband and wife. They live their own lives and ignore each other; the power of social supervision is still weak. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In general, our means of actively grasping clues are not enough, and the efficiency of information screening is not high enough.&quot; As a colleague, Gan Keyi also feels the same way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of Mao Zhaohui, director of the Anti-Corruption and Integrity Policy Research Center of Renmin University of China, eight-hour supervision can be a supervisory method to improve the conduct and discipline at the grassroots level, but it is limited by manpower, material resources, resources and means. It&#39;s not yet a regular job. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mao Zhaohui’s suggestion is, “If we want to achieve better results through eight-hour supervision, we should effectively introduce social supervision, including public opinion supervision and media supervision.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 26 Nov 2023 19:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“每一个蚌里都可能藏着一颗奇妙的珍珠”——第十届乌镇戏剧节青年竞演]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261257]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-26 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/22/IGoaZnhErhcYd1kqBeoNHzM1QQUoZ05K1v0a0Mwo.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/IGoaZnhErhcYd1kqBeoNHzM1QQUoZ 05K1v0a0Mwo. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259256&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Clam and Pearl&quot; stills&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Provided by the Wuzhen Theater Festival Organizing Committee/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the day from October 20 to 26, 2023, at the entrance of the Bengwan Theater in Xizha, Wuzhen, there was always a queue waiting to watch the show. The queue can sometimes stretch to the river. In September, free tickets for online reservations for the Wuzhen Theater Festival Youth Performance Competition (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Youth Competition&quot;&lt;/span>;) will be available at the beginning of the ticket sales It was robbed. This is one of the most important units of the Wuzhen Theater Festival every year, and it is also the only competition unit. Among the works of 18 groups of young dramatists, the Small Town Award for Best Drama, Best Individual Performance Award, and Special Attention Award will be determined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a sign in front of the fence outside the Bengwan Theater, indicating that ⅩⅩⅩ spectators can be admitted for this youth game. In the theater, the works of 18 groups of young dramatists were performed in turn; a screen was temporarily hung on a stone wall outside the theater for audiences who were unable to enter to watch the live broadcast. Under the scorching sun, there were always five or six rows of enthusiastic audiences sitting on the floor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2013, the Wuzhen Theater Festival has been running for 10 years, and the Youth Competition has also been running for 10 years. Bengwan Theater is named after the earliest place name here. Huang Lei thinks it is good, &quot;There are many clams in Bengwan, and each clam may hide a wonderful pearl.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wuzhen Theater Festival One of the initiators, actor Huang Lei, who has taught at the Beijing Film Academy for many years, has &quot;deep gratitude&quot; and &quot;profound reflection on the shortcomings&quot; of traditional art education. He brought some ideas that could not be implemented in school to the Wuzhen Theater Festival. This year, two days before the opening of the 10th Wuzhen Theater Festival, in a handwritten letter to the youth competition, Huang Lei wrote, &quot;In the beginning, when the Wuzhen Theater Festival was just a small idea, young people were already fans of this festival. The protagonist, the origin and goal of everything is for the young people.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Youth Competition is open to young people who are interested in engaging in the theater industry. The rules are very simple: each of the three founders of the Wuzhen Theater Festival will bring a prop to form the group. The annual proposition - use these 3 props to rehearse an original play with no more than 5 people in 20-30 minutes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May this year, Huang Lei, Lai Shengchuan, and Meng Jinghui, the founders of the Wuzhen Theater Festival, proposed the topic for the youth competition: world-famous paintings, train tickets, horses. &quot;The fundamental purpose of the three props is not to test how you use the props, but to test how you use the environment, find effective stage fulcrums, and maximize the energy density of the play per unit time.&quot; Youth competition judge Li Bo said. In August, more than 500 works were submitted; in September, 18 groups of shortlisted works were announced; in mid-October, the group lottery for performances at the Wuzhen Theater Festival was released. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The stage of Bengwan Theater is small and the layout is simple: ceiling light and curtain. The audience formed a semicircle, surrounding the stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The small stage of Qingsai has produced many theater people over the years. In 2013, &quot;Baba Mama&quot; directed by Chen Minghao won the first prize. This year he is well-known to the public for his performance in &quot;The Long Season&quot;; in 2015, Wu Bi won the Best Drama Award for &quot;Stillness&quot;. This year he is also a judge of the Youth Competition , is also an actor in Lai Shengchuan&#39;s new drama &quot;Long Alley&quot;. Wu Bi once said that Wuzhen was the biggest turning point in his career. &quot;You can have no cost and nothing, but you can do what you want to do and give everyone a stage for so many people to watch.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/M6Z6ezjdpK9vyrDYsgTZsLoWe4HSqc0pmODUU6Bw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;686&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data -src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/M6Z6ezjdpK9vyrDYsgTZsLoWe4HSqc0pmODUU6Bw.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259261&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wuzhen Theater Festival Youth Competition Unit Judge Li Bo&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Bo participated in the first three Youth Competitions as a contestant, and his works all entered the top three. From the fourth time, he became one of the judges of the Youth Competition, responsible for selecting 18 groups of shortlisted works from hundreds of works; and then selected from the 18 groups. There will be 6 sets of final works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he was in his early 20s, Li Bo studied in the Performance Department of Beijing Film Academy and enjoyed freedom and romance in the ivory tower. Later he became a university teacher. &quot;I always felt that I had no goals and no outlet, so I was very confused.&quot; Participate The Wuzhen Theater Festival has directional significance for him. He said that it is a way for more people to understand his theatrical concepts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the 10 days in Wuzhen, I spent a lot of time at the Bengwan Theater. From these youth plays, I can see the disappearance of love between men and women, the love between mother and daughter, and father and son. The hidden pain caused by the bondage, and the individual&#39;s reflection on the tearing of the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The story of &quot;Fifth Floor, Ninth Floor&quot;, which won the Best Drama Award, is set in a malfunctioning elevator. For half an hour, a boy on the fifth floor and a girl on the ninth floor reflect on their intimate relationship. , one feels that he is trapped by his boyfriend, and the other may be trapped by his girlfriend. They all wanted to run away and take imaginary train tickets to the north to see the auroras. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/YTBsOeV8Us98w43JUFXAKA3juucRsaCWN6MX13mP.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/YTBsOeV8Us98w43JUFXAKA3juucRsaCWN6MX13mP.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259258&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stills of &quot;Fifth Floor and Ninth Floor&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Provided by Wuzhen Theater Festival Organizing Committee/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Clam and Pearl&quot; won the Special Attention Award and the Best Individual Performance Award. The protagonist is a very controlling mother. With the help of a psychologist, she reveals the trauma of being violated as a girl. At the end, the daughter takes a photo of her mother, and the mother looks back and turns into a picture of &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Me and Liu Hongmei at the Station&quot;, which also won the Special Attention Award, has only one actor from beginning to end. &quot;I&quot; left the big city and returned to his hometown to become a staff member of the amusement park carousel project. We met several times. &quot;She&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;grandma who has lived her whole life in her hometown&lt;/span>;), when she was 15 years old, she wanted to secretly go swimming in the river; when she was in her twenties, She wanted to go to Beijing and Shanghai, and she cried anxiously when she lost her train ticket; she was 82 years old, thin, silent, and old, and time passed quickly on her; in the end, &quot;I&quot; took the 6-year-old &quot;she&quot; everywhere Carousel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/fU6jjhR6Sz0KwolNzteM4YohY6FGSerkhP5iORe0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/fU6jjhR6Sz0KwolNzteM4YohY6FGSerkhP5iORe0.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259257&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Still photo of &quot;Liu Hongmei and I were at the Station&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Provided by Wuzhen Theater Festival Organizing Committee/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;One night during the drama festival, Li Bo queued up to watch Meng Jinghui&#39;s new play at the Zhenshui Carving Hall, and heard an audience member complain about a certain Qingsai play. Li Bo found it quite interesting. This just reflects the diversification of the youth competition standards. &quot;It is true that the audience has mixed reviews of that play, but it is the only one-man show performed in this way on the youth competition stage in the past 10 years. We must encourage it, maybe in the future It will form a unique style. Young people should do a lot of exploration in their plays. If the plays are done very neatly, then it is Teacher Lai, right?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images .infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/Uzl3RRMgJu8UzwrzdxTezjUAsrdeAxd7cscXsI7f.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/23/11/22/Uzl3RRMgJu8UzwrzdxTezjUAsrdeAxd7cscXsI7f.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259259&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;This Youth Championship Finals The crew of the shortlisted work &quot;Open the Unopenable Window&quot; took their final bow&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Zhang Yuxin/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the finalists were announced and After the theater festival, Li Bo was interviewed twice by Southern People Weekly. The following is Li Bo&#39;s dictation:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Qingsai is a school that allows you to have cute flaws&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;On October 26, we discussed the 6 shortlisted plays, and we wanted to take an official photo of the judges discussing the finalists. We all sat upright, holding the play review list. Later, someone came up with a point. Director Cheng Er was the first to stand up and said, no, this stage is so rare, this play must use the language of drama. Later, they all stood up and argued: what is reverence for the stage, what is the language of drama, how to perform in a small theater, how to use the three props, what to do if the performance times out...&lt;/span>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;There are more than 500 works registered, and we have to take care of a variety of themes, styles, and expressions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Qing Sai is a school that allows you to have cute flaws. However, the dramas that were shortlisted for their flaws at the time were almost out of shape on the youth competition stage. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;There is a play, the registration deadline is August 20th, I think they recorded it on August 19th , it’s too late if we don’t record it again. The video was taken at a piano store, and the first shot is still shaking. What they were performing was a light comedy, and the actors had to be absolutely relaxed. They probably acted as if they were not shortlisted. They came across a lot of spiritual and advanced comedy lines on the scene, so the ear guide team brought this up to the scene. . I was having a meeting out of town and was really bored, so I just put on headphones and watched the video. They were presented in a relaxed and playful way, and I was particularly happy to see them. The actor forgot his lyrics and laughed loudly, and so did I. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The finalists were announced later. The organizing committee called, signed the confirmation letter, designed the poster, and went to Wuzhen. Arrange three public rehearsals, an interview, a few more rehearsals, and then three rounds of performances. They began to realize that this was a competition and became nervous. When people are nervous, they become unfree. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The official Weibo announced the finalists, and there was a message saying that each of these six plays Solid, congratulations to them. This evaluation is the greatest encouragement for our work. Some plays may look good and rich, but they are too fluttery and tasteless at first glance; some may look steady, but the whole presentation has a poise that is rare for young people. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; This year, I have made the highest level of judges and saw the overall level of the work. Six in the finals of this year can really choose 6, we are finally choosing. It happened that I met the drama I liked very much. Some judges did not like it. The two of us have been arguing, but this is academic and does not involve individuals. When I work in a unit, I often answer &quot;yes&quot; &quot;yes, you are right&quot;, but there is no such problem in the Wuzhen Drama Festival, and I have been fighting with Teacher Lai. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; This year&#39;s props are a horse, world famous painting, and train tickets. In addition to performing and text, the most important thing is how to use 3 elements, because this competition is supported by 3 elements. When we judge, if the two shows are similar, we will see the props. Each of the three teachers gives a prop to prevent adaptation of the old work. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; The use of props, specially tests the professional level of a crew. For example, the two of us did not fight or defeat, and a knife suddenly appeared. Everyone wanted to catch the knife. This knife caused a turning point in the drama and changed the direction of the drama. This is a common usage. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; For props, only mention that this is the simplest; Key role? Or is it an image and symbol, running through the whole scene, and always hovering in your mind? These are the three levels of completely different levels. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; This year&#39;s props are difficult to be world famous paintings, because there are few experience in Chinese people in the Chinese people. . Some plays are &quot;Girls with Pearl Earrings&quot;, and some of them are family members who use her works as world -famous paintings, and some are actors to imitate &quot;Scream&quot;, which is very cute. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; &quot;I and Liu Hongmei at the station&quot;, all of our judges have reached the finals. I think it should have an inseparable relationship with the use of the finals and props. The image of the horse runs through the pass. We learn to perform, and props are the stage fulcrum, and the key items to promote the development of the plot are good. How can we also appear on the stage, but there is no appear in this play. The script mentioned the game of rotating Trojan, &quot;I&quot; walked around the stage, like a rotating Trojan, encountered the &quot;I&quot; 姥, and every time &quot;I&quot; saw Liu Hongmei at different stages, it happened. Different things are related to Liu Hongmei&#39;s fate. In the end, &quot;I&quot; returned to the job and rotated the little Trojan for other children. So fresh and so natural. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/fn6icx3pjfk5pewyt8zjdjqdhwyiq9o.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; 0 &quot;0 &quot;width =&quot; 960 &quot;height =&quot; 720 &quot;data-src =&quot; // images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/fn6icx3pjfk5pewyt8zlsin7jdjqdhwyiq9o.jpg &quot;data-key = &quot;259260&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p STYLE = &quot;COLOR: #999; Text-Align: Center;&quot;>; The repertoire &quot;Then the tide, the sun, the moon&quot; is over.

Quickly Douyin can achieve all your desires for one minute. Why would anyone consume two hours of life in the theater and watch the show? First of all, this play must have a temperature. Second, what you talk about in the play is not watching Douyin Kuaishou Weibo often. You have to lead the audience to pay attention to the people we have never paid attention to in life. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; So far, choose a show in previous youth games, I think the best It was &quot;Gama&quot; in 2016 (Reporter Note: The title of the Youth Championship of that year was a drop of blood, a suitcase, and a meteor. The protagonist of &quot;Gama&quot; was a pair of mothers and daughters. Dad who became a living Buddha, the living Buddha was dead. Ama firmly believed that the living Buddha could return to his home within 49 days, hoping to get pregnant with his daughter Gama; the child of Gama Huai was the reincarnation of Gesanghua, and the child died. The two women intend to go to the pilgrimage and finally reconcile on the way to Shenhu). The two graduate students of the Shanghai Academy of Drama are the only best personal performance award and award in the history of the Youth Championship to a team. Belief in the stage, usually performed in complexity, but that play is particularly simple, a chair, two girls, one of them played two characters (the grandma who never forgets her husband, and the granddaughter of the reincarnation of Gesanghua flower ), It&#39;s so simple, but so transparent. After they finished their long heads, they looked at it from a distance. A cold light came over and wow, it was a lake. It sounds like Tibetan music, and we feel that we are in the Snow Plateau. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; From the first to the present, all the awards are small Talk about life downhill. You can grab a person casually from Xizha. You can understand it at the age of 10 and below 90. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; The stage of the Qing race is very close to the audience. Really, it is the most important. Is your drama core tell us through a small thing or a fake modular formation through a philosophical event? I especially don&#39;t like to tell us what to order, or forcibly instilling what I want to use. Including judges&#39; voting, the results of this play are not good. You don&#39;t need to be so complicated by young people&#39;s drama. Come on to discuss To BE or not to be. Sorry, you really have no skill. Sometimes you want to follow the two things. I still hope to make the story clear: there is a rotary, character, contradiction, conflict, and themes, even if there is no intention, it is rare. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; You see Liu Tianqi&#39;s &quot;Chicken Rabbit Same Cage&quot; (Reporter Note: Best Drama Award in Youth Award -winning work) How simple, the son went to the prison to see his dad, and the two had a conversation. There is a big world in the small drama. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; I still think young people do not need to play cool, play dazzling, solid, put their energy with energy, let go In the story, how the story is architected and how to expand; the performance must be converged. I particularly hate the kind of splashing performance that can be brushed in short videos, but many people may be affected and feel that our play must be &quot;up&quot;. I told the players in the Qingsea that the most difficult and calm appearance of my heart and calm appearance. Is there a howling of Maron Bailandu, Robert Dinro, Alpasino, and Ah Pasino that made him collapse? His emotions are the reservoir, and if you want to come out, you will come out as much as possible. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; We also need to learn this on the stage. The performance of the performance must be subtle, restrained, and forbearing. Do not perform this drama because of the audience&#39;s shout and applauding, so that the noise is to win the lord. Some play calls are particularly high, but we feel a little pleased with the audience and perform once. I know which bag is in and where, and we will fight for the second time, without even control and rhythm. &quot;Liu Hongmei and I at the Station&quot; is particularly stable and does not cater to the audience. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; Unicorns are not easy to act, a person has to interpret many people. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; We watched the registration video, there are a lot of unicorn. Many like we did at that time when we went to school -a person encountered a dilemma in the unit time. Through the struggle of the people and the natural environment, the problem pushed the problem to a certain orgasm. But we should show the audience who come to Wuzhen to show new things and real things.我们这次选的有3个独角戏，像《我和刘红梅在车站》，都不是传统意义上的独角戏表演了，更多的时候是在说话、在流露，在特别平淡的状态里，但内心是There is content. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; I think the mussels in Wuzhen and the youth game are an experimental field of young Chinese drama people, As long as you have the ability, you can put your own experiments on the stage. The audience is tolerant, and our judges are also tolerant. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/mzxxxutifmioayaslcxgjc6iobwlg9obs&quot; border = &quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 960 &quot;height =&quot; 720 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/mzolwjxxutifmioayaslcxgjc6OBSW.JPG &quot;Data-key = &quot;259262&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p STYLE = &quot;COLOR: #999; Text-Align: Center;&quot;>; Outside the Gongwan Theater, all the posters of this year&#39;s works are pasted on the bellite brick wall &lt;span style = &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Southern Character Weekly reporter Zhang Yuxin/Picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; If we do not do drama, we can of course understand &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti ; &quot;>; I participated in the Youth Championship as a player in the three years of 33, 34, and 35 years old. It is also unforgettable and worth it. In the first year, I did the only comedy in 12 dramas; the second year I did the only physical drama, without lines; in the third year, I did the only montage drama to explain the performance by light. Now I am still a teacher, but I ca n’t have something like that three years. The experience of human experience is getting richer and less courageous. Especially when working in universities, imagination is not so empty. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; In the first year of the youth competition, we lined up at two or three o&#39;clock every night at school, lined up in the school, and lined up. Students have to give up, saying that such judges must have high specifications and cannot be shortlisted. I said that when I have been a teacher for so many years, I have also done scientific research and awards. The competition that does not receive registration fees must be a good game. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; I teach is the two colleges and universities in the public, students from enrollment and Nortel Chinese Opera There is a gap. The students in my first competition, the &quot;survival rate&quot; is very high, one is in the happy twist, one in the Dalian drama group, and the other is now a cargo anchor. In the live broadcast, his live broadcast skills and performances are linked. He will now hang and smash. Rather than watching his live broadcast, it is better to watch him perform a show. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; I also rehearse in college, and also score in two types of brains. ideas. Chinese universities are actually the same. University education has the characteristics of universities. Therefore, the props of young people to get the Wuzhen Drama Festival may be very excited, because they finally have the opportunity to be a comedy, tragedy or absurd drama that really likes and has a sense of life. Let&#39;s say that it is particularly not good, and Wuzhen&#39;s play is not to say that you can perform every day after you play in Wuzhen. Just 10 days, you won the prize, and the opportunity to perform (continued) is also very small. Some plays are very tender, but because of its magnificent scenes, they have been performing. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; I still encourage young people to go to the drama festival to watch and play. The drama enthusiasts across the country have gathered in a place to talk about the drama together. This precious is lingering in your mind for a lifetime. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; The goal of Wuzhen Drama Festival is very clear. manage. There is no way to have a chain -style, helping to help the flames like some film festivals. The drama is still niche, and the number of screens across the country must be much more than the theater. But we are to deeply give them a stitched heart. Every year, there are players who have been shortlisted in the Wuzhen Youth Championships. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; Everyone has their own choice of life.

The outside world summarizes some possible reasons: some graduates have changed their tests and compiled, strive to get iron rice bowls in one step, and withdraw from the postgraduate track; there are also some graduates no longer regard the postgraduate entrance examination as the election, thinking that a paper is a paper paper, thinking that a paper is a paper. Graduate diplomas may not be able to find a good job, and it is better to enter the employment market in advance to save opportunities for opportunities. The graduate recruitment policy of major universities has changed. Sensitive candidates retired sharply in front of high tuition fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is not difficult to see that these reasons stem from the rational choice of candidates as a &quot;economic man&quot;: reading has become more and more investment, and the consumption attributes of higher education are also strengthening. If candidates do not think that studying graduate cannot improve the competitiveness of the employment market, and cannot bring good economic returns in the future, the candidates will rationally consider &quot;not worth the research on research on research&quot;, thereby reducing the &quot;supply&quot; of the higher education market. A madly rumor that a postgraduate teacher successfully predicted the decline in the number of postgraduate entrance examinations. In fact, this also shows that his &quot;evangelism&quot; has received some results over the years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; From the perspective of statistical data, the change of candidates&#39; attitude has also undergone several years, which is essentially the &quot;reverse incentive&quot; brought about by changes in the employment market. Statistics of the number of postgraduate applicants over the years show that this number has declined in 2014 and 2015, but since 2015, it has shown a rise and reached its peak in 2023. The increasing expansion of graduate students and the increase of graduates year by year has allowed the speed of the employment market to keep up with the employment needs of graduates. This imbalance of supply and demand has naturally transmitted to the upstream higher education market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It should be acknowledged that in reality, in order to satisfy the enthusiasm of personal knowledge or study for scientific research, most students are not high, and most students are studying or employment. Among them In order to delay the further studies of employment and &quot;gold -plated study&quot; for better employment. However, unfortunately, in the case of weak employment market, these two research methods are facing great challenges. Of course, students are not fools, but they also adjust their life strategies according to social reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The key factors affecting the supply and demand of the employment market are the economic cycle and industrial structure. The feedback of the employment market also determines the cost -effectiveness of research. No part of students, employers, and colleges and universities cannot answer the question of &quot;reading value is not valuable&quot; alone. In the situation where the demand for the employment market is not stubborn, both employers and candidates have begun to answer this question: the company&#39;s side is to reduce the scale of the school recruitment, and the number of candidates for candidates has declined. It is worth asking, how will the university respond here? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Since the beginning of this century, the number of Chinese graduate students has increased year by year. From 220,000 to more than 1 million in 2020 in 2003, it has accounted for about 10 % of the undergraduate graduates of that year. For many years, major universities have been so rapidly to expand their master&#39;s degree in graduate students. In order to observe it is to strive for more benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In addition to the &quot;reverse incentive&quot; of the employment market, the downturn of fertility rate is destined to continue the number Fields, this will be a more decisive factor than &quot;candidates&#39; choice or not.&quot; In other words, the decline in the number of postgraduates is an irreversible trend. In the future, colleges and universities may usher in a one -million -level enrollment gap each year, and they have to face the severe situation of &quot;stock competition&quot; of students. challenge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Learning the Master&#39;s Rehabilitation, Extension of Expansion of the Master&quot;, &quot;Extend the Specialty System&quot;, which is a response plan that some universities have come up. Academic expenses. However, the problem is that the university can make articles on the academic system and quota of colleges and universities, can really &quot;ensure the quality of cultivation and improve employment competitiveness&quot;, or it has become &quot;more than one year tuition fee&quot; or even &quot;delaying a year for a year. Employment &quot;is quite discussed and reflected in itself. Some candidates&#39; concerns about the cost -effectiveness of the State is probably one of the reasons for the decrease in the number of postgraduate entrance examinations this year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the principle of organizational behavior, &quot;the organization will create work for themselves, and organizational employees will work hard to create work.&quot; Since a organization has established Public sector who eats fiscal funds. Public universities have long relied on taxpayers&#39; money for a long time. They do not need to face market competition directly. Naturally, they will naturally try to keep their existing graduate points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, the impact of changes in supply and demand and decline in the employment market will be transmitted sooner or later. The arrival of the enrollment gap has shown an irreversible trend. In accordance with the demand of the employment market, comprehensively considering the needs of social needs, adjusting the recruitment plan of graduate students, and better serving the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 26 Nov 2023 17:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[从不被理解到亚运项目，中国电子竞技20年]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261341]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-26 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;On November 18, 2003, e-sports was listed as the 99th sports competition event by the State Sports General Administration.

He was referring to the interview with Southern People Weekly in 2019, when he had just graduated from the Central Academy of Drama. In the past few years, his acting career had become more mature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xincheng has appeared in more types of film and television works and discovered more diverse artistic skills, including participating in reality shows, releasing music albums, and expressing his thoughts more freely in interviews, showing a more relaxed attitude. On the one hand, &quot;I used to think this was not good, that was not good, but now I feel more confident.&quot; But he still habitually looks at himself and cares about his external presentation, just like when he was watching a movie on set Playback in the viewfinder, scrolling through audience comments on social media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The radar of self-examination is always on. Zhang Xincheng will often make corrections or additions to a sentence after finishing it. &quot;When making a movie, you will feel that you are dedicating yourself to art. ... The art here is a false proposition. It is not art in a broad sense, but the art you think you are. When you dedicate yourself to it, you will feel very ritualistic. &quot;Every time the team we work with work hard, everyone is immersed in it, there are no bystanders. Of course, there will be a creator trap for insiders, and they may go to the other extreme, but the process is wonderful.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Family education and schooling experience have shaped Zhang Xincheng’s serious and rigorous character. In middle school, he was taught to be a top student. &quot;My mother always told me not to do anything inappropriate, so I stuck to the rules most of the time.&quot; After entering the Chinese Opera, he was taught to be a good actor. He will talk about performances with an academic attitude, how to accurately and naturally say the word, how to design habits to distinguish the characters, and his rationality and caution will even let him even design the shortcomings of the character, because perfect people do not exist without existence . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Zhang Xincheng feels that he is not a very self-motivated person in nature. He is lazy and procrastinates. He is also not a person who uses rationality to choose the optimal solution. He is more willing to follow his inner thoughts of escape. After working, like all young people who are just beginning to try to be independent, he slowly freed himself from the shackles of previous disciplines and &quot;opened up&quot; himself through the profession of actor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xincheng, who views himself &quot;rationally&quot;, is more &quot;emotional&quot; in his choice of scripts. He still tends to choose tragic characters that he is more interested in, such as Cheng Yizhi in &quot;The Light&quot;, who is born like Weed, who has been tortured, has seen all the darkness and filth in the world; Pei Zhi in &quot;The Basics of Genius&quot; has been making a choice between sacrificing for his family and pursuing himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xincheng has gained an ancient Greek tragic aesthetic in these characters, &quot;Life itself is dull, but the life in the drama has ups and downs. There may be a car accident, and the life will be broken; there may be a meeting To the death of loved ones. But pain is directly proportional to happiness. During the filming process, the more pain and torture I experienced, the more happiness I felt in retrospect.&quot; In the unusual tragic experience, the perceptual switch was turned on. Open it, &quot;I can feel the emotions of the world more and start to receive signals.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Equal time&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s like building blocks high and then knocking them all down again. From learning to be a Since he was an actor, Zhang Xincheng has been training himself to shape characters, designing and reviewing at the same time. When filming &quot;Basic Method of Genius&quot;, he felt that these external formal things were &quot;finished&quot; and no longer needed to be done deliberately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I suddenly noticed that when I say a line, I don’t just say it to rhythm and handle it well, but to put this sentence into the opponent’s heart. Every expression and line I make, It is stimulating the opponent. All the designs are not important. When you feel the emotion in your heart, you will naturally express it.&quot; When filming &quot;Dark Fire&quot;, Zhang Xincheng acted in Mandarin with dialect color, and he no longer thought about how to act. He spoke his lines but didn&#39;t say a single word wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The process of building, tearing down and rebuilding was not peaceful and was accompanied by long periods of anxiety. Zhang Xincheng&#39;s debut went smoothly. He started taking roles while he was in school, and one crew followed another. But he felt that he did not have a particularly distinctive trait that made people remember him, and he could not find one for himself. &quot;It seems difficult for me to do it.&quot; When participating in a reality show, he should have found a way to highlight himself, but he was still used to it. Hard back to the ground; follow the heart when choosing the script. When the result is not satisfactory, it is inevitable to fall into myself. &quot;Isn&#39;t that ability?&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Zhang Xincheng can say it frankly this year, , &quot;I can&#39;t do this&quot;, and can accept all choices calmly, &quot;I want to understand, time is equal, you didn&#39;t do that thing in those four months, but you did other things, you got It’s like opening a box, you can only choose one box, and you can’t see the contents of other boxes. You lose the other boxes, but you get this one.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After the sense of gain and loss and utilitarianism became less strong, looking back on the past, he finally changed his self-evaluation passing score to 90 points. &quot;If life is lived for a result, it seems that time will become shorter. If the process is unfolded, , it seems that a lot of things have happened, just have fun in the process.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xincheng knows what the pinnacle of his career is: to become a highly reputable actor, not just for his excellent acting skills. , has commercial value, is respected by others, and is unique. He also missed the beginning of his career. At an age when he didn’t know what filming was, he had endless energy every day. After filming, he would play with the crew and take photos with costumes, props, and scene management. “I don’t think so. I was stupid at that time, and I thought it was quite valuable. It took a long time to receive education and change the habits of childhood, but it would be very difficult to finally return to the freedom of childhood.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;True The Paradox&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What adjectives would you use to describe yourself? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Xincheng: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Lazy, out-of-the-box thinking, and optimistic. I used to think that I was pessimistic, because I often saw things in a bad light, but I found that there might be a layer of optimism underneath the pessimism. After thinking about it, I still felt that things would definitely get better, and I still believed in some hope. Although I prefer tragedies, it is precisely because I have a relatively optimistic core that I like tragedies and dare to watch them. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you think is your most distinctive trait? , a trait that comes to mind when everyone mentions it, or do you think you have such a trait? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Xincheng: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I don’t think I have such a trait. Everyone knows that I usually play the roles I have played, but actually I don’t know either. What are your own personal characteristics. In this short video era, people are always required to have a very obvious label. But I feel like I&#39;m not that kind of person. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When you participate in a reality show, you will give Do you want to find a characteristic that you want to show to everyone? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Xincheng: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;No, I participated in the variety show just to rest, not to highlight myself. I don’t speak much in it, and I don’t lead opinions. Everyone says you have to do this or that, stand out and let everyone remember you. I think that will put a lot of pressure on me. I am not a person who talks a lot at any time, so I don’t force myself to talk deliberately. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you think you are in the reality show?

Not everything is deliberately created, but people have many shortcomings. In real people, When I show off, I try my best to cover up these shortcomings and try my best to be the best version of myself. I feel that this is not the real me. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is different when you are acting, because you are not yourself, so you are very free. When we were children, we played a game called &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; in which we raced and shot. In reality, no one would do this because they are bound by morality, but in the game there is no such thing. It does not mean that everyone desires to do sinful things. It just means you are freest when you are not yourself. The role is played by you, and you do his things, but people don’t think you are him. You are not “you”, but you are “you”. Instead, reality shows must become a better “you”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You often share your life on social media, what do you like to shoot?

Can’t we just move forward? Now I will stop and take a few photos without knowing what I am taking, as if it is stored in the camera forever. I especially don&#39;t like to delete any record. So much memory is just for a certain moment in life, and I suddenly want to see it. I don&#39;t want this to get lost. It felt like I had seized the moment. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I like to take black and white photos, high-contrast black and white, followed by photos with rich tones. It is a flaw that does not restore reality very well, but it is also a kind of beauty and has a sense of story. The sense of story is what attracts me, because there are so many good-looking things that make people dazzled and even attracted. But a photo with a story is rare in daily life and is relatively precious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 26 Nov 2023 15:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[守护“千年鸟道”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261251]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-26 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/22/eOvutWJW8Nobv2bGQ5Xv1RJqvRtwZxeiKuL383km.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;669&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/eOvutWJW8Nobv2bGQ5Xv1RJqvRtw ZxeiKuL383km. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259229&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 26, 2023, Congjiang Town, Guidong County, Hunan Province and Jiangxi Province At the Nanfengao Migratory Bird Protection Station at the junction of Yingpanwei Township, Suichuan County, bird rangers from the two provinces and two counties conduct joint bird protection inspections in the mountains &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Guo Liliang/Photo)&lt;/ span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Billions of migratory birds migrate across continents every year, and 3 of the 8 migration routes pass through China.

Recently, some new energy vehicle owners have reported that charging fees at public charging piles have increased since the second half of the year. Does this situation exist? With this question in mind, reporters conducted investigations in many places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Drivers of operating vehicles are more sensitive to changes in charging fees for new energy vehicles. Master Wei is an online ride-hailing driver in Zhengzhou, Henan, because he goes to public charging stations to charge once or twice a day. His mobile phone clearly records the cost of each charge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/8707fe1a673b3f7a07d093f566fc40ca.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/8707fe1a673b3f7a07d093f566fc40ca.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259659&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Henan Zhengzhou Net Ride-hailing driver Wei Zhenhua: My charging fee has obviously increased. It used to be 1,200 yuan a month, but now it is as high as 1,500 yuan. It has indeed increased a lot. Especially after August, it rose by about 20 to 30%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The charging fee at public charging piles consists of two parts: electricity price and service fee. Electricity prices have been mainly formed by the market, with &quot;level in and level out&quot; and charging pile operators are not allowed to increase prices. Prices vary in different seasons and during peak, wave, and flat periods every day. The service fee is determined by each charging pile operating company based on market conditions. During the interview, the reporter found that charging fees at public piles have increased not only in Zhengzhou but also in many cities in Henan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/06b4189b0c487b25cc2eed44e60cad19.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;662&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/06b4189b0c487b25cc2eed44e60cad19.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259661&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A new energy Co., Ltd. Henan regional director Yu Haitao: We charging companies have raised the service fee for primary charging. It has been raised by about 1 jiao to 1 jiao and 2 cents compared to the beginning of the year. So overall, everyone feels the increase in charging prices. The amplitude is relatively large. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Surveys show that the service fees of some charging companies have even increased by about 50%. So, why do they want to adjust the price? Some charging pile operating companies told reporters that the high cost of early investment in charging pile construction and the long-term strategy of &quot;grabbing the market&quot; for low-price operations have put them under greater operating pressure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/97ea8d2c1b65c4cf3814e67c0b.jpeg&quot; width = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot;117 6 &quot;Height = &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/97ea8d2c1b65c4cf380c9c6814e67c0b.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259657&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An electronics company in Henan Wei Hongyu, Operations Director of Technology Co., Ltd.: The main reason for this increase is that as our operations deepen, we find that there is even a risk of inversion in the service fee income of charging stations compared to our station construction costs and our operating costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Financial reports of some charging operation companies show that although the company&#39;s operating income is rising every year, it is negative profits every year. At the same time, in order to attract more users, operators tend to build high-power charging piles. However, the basic cost of high-power charging piles is relatively high. Some also need to build additional corresponding distribution boxes, and maintenance costs will naturally increase. . Therefore, raising service fees has become the current solution to recover costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The cost of using new energy vehicles still has a greater advantage than that of gasoline vehicles&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Through interviews and surveys, the reporter found that in some cities, the rising charging costs of electric vehicles do exist. So this situation Does it happen in all cities across the country? Are the cost advantages of buying an electric car still there? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During interviews and surveys in many places, reporters found that the rise in charging costs for new energy vehicles only occurred in some cities, and charging costs in most cities across the country fell into a stable range. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/51786d4413d5411912229c0755b9dc9e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/51786d4413d5411912229c0755b9dc9e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259658&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beijing New Energy Car owner: There is not much increase. I have charged at several nearby charging stations. There is not much change. It is basically the same as before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shenzhen new energy vehicle owners: The electricity price at this time is 1.27 yuan per unit. The overall cost is not particularly high and it is quite affordable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data from the China Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Promotion Alliance show that from January to October this year, the number of public charging piles in my country was 728,000, and the number in October was 63,000, a year-on-year increase of 50.3%. The increase in the number of charging piles not only meets the rapid development of new energy vehicles, but also makes competition among charging pile operating companies more intense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/b7fa96dfbaeb011d9617520d6d2e690a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/b7fa96dfbaeb011d9617520d6d2e690a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259662&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A smart phone in Beijing Chen Dong, the person in charge of Technology Co., Ltd.: The overall charging price is still relatively low now, because the competition in the industry is fierce. We have more than 40 charging stations in Beijing. Winter is the peak charging season, and the overall cost has not been adjusted upwards. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Experts said that fluctuations in charging fees in most cities are the result of market supply and demand adjustments, and the quality of increases or decreases cannot be judged absolutely. Most cities have now abolished the maximum price limit on service fees, and each operator can determine the level of charging service fees based on market competition. At the same time, in the face of the issue raised by some netizens that the cost of using new energy vehicles is almost equal to that of gasoline vehicles, experts also gave reporters a calculation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/4bc772773657773a07d7dfe0eb594a4d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/4bc772773657773a07d7dfe0eb594a4d.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259660&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China Electric Power Corporation Liu Yongdong, deputy secretary-general of the federation: For example, for every 100 kilometers of our oil truck, the industry requires about 10 liters of oil. We estimate that it will be calculated at about 8 yuan, which is 80 yuan. Let&#39;s look at the tram again. On average, it requires about 15 kilowatt hours of electricity per 100 kilometers. The overall consumption of each kilowatt hour of electricity plus service fees is about 1.5 yuan. So the entire 15 kilowatt hours of electricity is about 22.5 yuan. Even if it is 25 yuan, we Comparing 25 yuan with 80 yuan, it should be said that there is still a huge gap. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; Various regions have launched new measures to shape the healthy development of new energy vehicles&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In order to ensure a good charging experience for new energy vehicle owners, various regions have successively introduced new policies such as time-of-use electricity prices for charging facilities. The implementation of relevant measures will not only guide car owners to use electricity rationally, but will also be more conducive to the healthy and sustainable development of the new energy vehicle industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September this year, Shandong began to implement a new time-of-use electricity price policy for residents&#39; charging, which subdivided the peak and valley periods and added deep valley and peak periods. During the deep valley period, the electricity price was 0.222 yuan per kilowatt hour, which is the same as The price difference during peak hours is 0.666 yuan per kilowatt hour. By widening the price difference, users are guided to avoid charging during peak hours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/97416b76a8b4710da6eed33e4ef12df7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/97416b76a8b4710da6eed33e4ef12df7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259663&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jimo District, Qingdao New energy vehicle owners: Now the electricity price in Shengu for charging at noon is only more than 2 cents per degree. If you go home and have a meal, the electricity will be fully charged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only Shandong, but also Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hunan, Shaanxi and other places have successively introduced time-of-use electricity price policies for residents’ electric vehicle charging facilities. During peak and peak hours, charging car owners need to bear more costs, and During off-peak periods, car owners can enjoy lower prices than before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/ac2c310d54f1abcd7b404c830cf87215.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/ac2c310d54f1abcd7b404c830cf87215.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259667&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shenzhen New Energy Car owner: It is the peak period for charging now. The current price is 1.49 degrees. We usually choose to charge at noon or at night, and the price will be more favorable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the continued efforts of government policies, some charging operating companies are also actively exploring new trends in future development. On the one hand, it is necessary to add new momentum to corporate operations, and on the other hand, the charging experience of car owners must also be considered. In order to &quot;stand out&quot; in the market competition, they choose to provide more comprehensive services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/97bd9ffcf65eb191c4e283ced6f959ab.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/97bd9ffcf65eb191c4e283ced6f959ab.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259665&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A new person in Shenzhen Chen Huanyu, operations director of the energy company: Our service fee is only about a little more than a triangle, which is 5% higher than the service fee of surrounding operators. Our advantage is that the supporting facilities are relatively complete, which solves the driver&#39;s dining problem. To solve the problem of rest, we also have a comprehensive service area with quick car repairs, quick washes, and a comprehensive online car-hailing service platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, charging operation companies have also strengthened the level of interconnection and interoperability. In Hainan, the reporter saw that the supervision and operation service platform linked different operators together.

Waking up early and staying late has become the norm. Getting up at 4 a.m. to go to the airport and returning home at 1:30 a.m. after finishing the day&#39;s activities is not an exception. Not staying out overnight is partly to take care of my young daughter’s emotions, but also to satisfy her pursuit of efficiency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She rarely used it to catch up on sleep when flying, but still raced against time to read and think. Since 2013, she has continued to travel to campuses of all ages, TV studios, events, lectures, forums, and dining tables used for live broadcasts and writing, sharing her deep dives in the Western Pacific with the &quot;Jiaolong&quot; Scientific expedition and the experience of participating in the 34th Antarctic Scientific Expedition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At first, she only gave lectures as a scientist as a researcher at the Second Institute of Oceanography of the Ministry of Natural Resources. Over the past ten years, she has gradually been dubbed a science popularization expert because of her tireless science popularization and vivid and humorous narration. title. In the past two years, she has won important honors such as Top Ten Science Communication Figures in China, Chief Science Communication Expert, and Female Science Popularization Expert. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the day of the interview, she spared a few hours, ate a sandwich at noon, and rushed home to prepare for the live broadcast at 4 p.m. Not long ago, she went to attend classes at universities and party schools. The topic she taught was the core of leadership from the perspective of biological evolution, from natural science to humanities and then to philosophy (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;This is her usual style&lt;/span>;), recalling her hearty smile and said, &quot;There was no urine in the whole process&quot;; then she was also invited to participate in a TED speech, the theme was &quot;If your major is a transfer, you What will happen next in life?” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Experienced the transition from engineering to science (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Undergraduate survey technology and engineering, postgraduate geological engineering, doctoral geology&lt;/p>; span>;), Tang Limei decided to switch his research field to marine geology after listening to a lecture by chance while studying for his PhD. He realized early on that life has no limits and is full of unexpected and unplanned nodes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With ten years of accumulation in science popularization, she will bring a new book &quot;Exploring the Deep Sea with the &quot;Dragon&quot;&quot; at the end of 2023 to show people a new face of a science popularization writer. The book will introduce the basic knowledge of the ocean (&lt;span style= &quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For example, what is the sea, what is the ocean, how to form&lt;/span>;), the five major oceans of the world (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Newly included in the Southern Ocean in 2021&lt;/span>;)&#39;s cutting-edge knowledge, personal experience in deep-sea exploration, and the development history of the country&#39;s manned deep submersibles, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It took less than half a year to write the book. She was busier than before. She didn&#39;t even have time to wash her face after getting up every morning. She said that her days now consist of only three things: work, exercise, and reading and thinking. She has been able to maintain her body shape for nearly 20 years after getting up early for a run. During the interview, she was wearing the team uniform she wore during the Antarctic scientific expedition in 2017, and it still fit her perfectly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other than that, there are very few pastimes, and I hardly watch movies. Everything I do must &quot;generate value and meaning.&quot; She would refuse without hesitation if asked to travel to the beach. Only when it became a matter of spending time with her children and family would she be willing to do so. &quot;I can&#39;t go out to play by myself, but I&#39;m willing to do it with others. It&#39;s valuable.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She recalled more than ten years ago when life was not so full. , I still have plenty of time to watch &quot;The Legend of Zhen Huan&quot;, and during the period when I went to the Pacific to &quot;isolate&quot;, I watched it intermittently nearly 20 times in total. &quot;It wouldn&#39;t be so busy then. I would definitely choose to read a book now.&quot; It wasn&#39;t until 2022 that she turned the content of the TV series into a class, and then she finally let go of the time wasted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/GDFKKq1U2uGe4wXxCkfhZo5gEfOBJvo01JL7UOFU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/GDFKKq1U2uGe4wXxCkfhZo5gEfOBJvo01JL7UOFU.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259210&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Ocean Open Class&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(video screenshot/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The lecture content revolves around &quot;Zhen Huan&quot; &quot;Scientific trivia in the Biography&quot;, &quot;For example, there is an episode where the emperor went to An Lingrong&#39;s place to celebrate her birthday. He was very tired of eating, so he happened to get him some light pastries. Why do we eat dessert after a meal? It&#39;s because we The perception of sweetness is at the tip of the tongue, and the perception of bitterness is at the back of the tongue, and then there are other areas in the middle, such as spicy food. Therefore, we can still eat something sweet after a meal because we can feel sweetness at the tip of the tongue at the earliest. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There is also braised pork, which is the Maillard reaction. Isn&#39;t the Maillard color popular this year? Maillard is actually caramel color, which is what it turns into after the sugar is burned. Color, what happens between it and braised pork is the Maillard reaction. Why do we need to add sugar? When you make braised pork, you can educate your children about science. These knowledge points are closely related to life; and why do we have oleander powder? Poisonous? I explained its formula, and then what is the most poisonous part of it? Tree trunks, leaves and flowers are all poisonous. Finally, why are these women fighting in the play? These are the backward ideas of feudal society. Let’s talk about it finally. The awakening of women in our new era includes humanistic methods.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She believes that subject segmentation is actually unscientific because &quot;all knowledge is interlinked&quot; and is often lacking in the dissemination of knowledge. Not even one. She likes the title of &quot;Science Communication Figure&quot;, &quot;It&#39;s quite appropriate. Just like preaching, science is also a cognitive system.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She looks at everything around her with a comprehensive view of the universe and cherishes it. Curious, &quot;Actually, everything is learning. You may have thought it was entertainment before, but with a learning mentality, if you really understand the background, culture or meaning of TV series, movies and other cultural works, it is actually learning.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;In her spare time during the Antarctic scientific expedition, Tang Limei also watched a few sporadic movies, including the literary film &quot;Sunset Trilogy&quot; series, which she also watched repeatedly. What attracts her is not the romantic encounter between the male and female protagonists, but the social topics that the two communicate and discuss from sunset to sunrise. &quot;In fact, the most attractive thing about it is its topic. It is not that two people are in love, they discuss They are all the destruction of society by developed countries, the infringement of weak countries, the garbage we produce now, the underlying logic of society, etc.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She has also watched some of &quot;Celebrating More Than Years&quot; and she likes it. With time-travel elements, I am also planning to write some science fiction novels next, &quot;For example, two fishes (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;because we humans evolved from fish (&lt;/span>;), a story of pure love that has gone through five mass extinctions, nine evolutions, and then traveled through several lives. In this long evolution, &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; is set in the universe. It may be based on the hundreds of millions of years of biological evolution.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that she is in the conceptual stage, she is already very excited. &quot;It should be particularly enjoyable if I write it later. In fact, this is a process of creation. The meaning of life lies in creation. Only when you create something you love, will you feel happy and in a flow.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2019, she participated in a training session at the Youth League School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and later became a member of the Youth Lecturers Group of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. Since then, she has frequently given lectures in colleges and universities. She noticed that the new generation of young people are increasingly concerned about spiritual values. &quot;Public welfare must be the trend in the future. There will definitely be more and more people engaged in charity and volunteer services among the post-2000 generation, because it may be difficult for them to make a rapid economic leap from their work, so they will look for other ways. To realize your own value, engage more in charity and manual work, that is, to help others and feel happiness from the process of serving others.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There will be more and more of these industries, like my daughter, What can you say to make her feel happy? It’s not that her mother went to her school and gave a speech. Everyone regarded me as an idol and worshiped me. This was a pressure for her; her happiness was similar to that once I took her to a friend&#39;s birthday party, and after she gave the butterfly she made with a twist stick to someone else, she felt sincerely happy because of the other person&#39;s gratitude.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first book has not yet been released, and it is non-stop. Tang Limei has already begun to imagine her future &quot;writing ambitions&quot;. &quot;If I publish one book every year, I can probably write 20 more in my life. I hope one or two of them will be popular science classics for teenagers.&quot; Through these words again and again. and written words. What she is committed to disseminating is not only scientific knowledge, but also &quot;the meaning of life.&quot; She hopes that her slightly tortuous but persevering experience can inspire young people and make those young faces in the audience understand, &quot;Everyone should have their own way out, and they should live well.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 26 Nov 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[吴慷仁，给自己拍拍手吧]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261336]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-26 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/25/ZJCNUHvqqsswjIpk4Tq6AEUJT96BP6xETrXHQmgA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/ZJCNUHvqqsswjIpk4Tq6AEUJT96BP 6xETrXHQmgA. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259646&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wu Kangren (Visual China) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Newcomer Wu Kangren&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Wu Kangren is standing in the middle of the lobby of a hotel in Xiamen, dancing and talking with people.

What I have to do at the moment is the most important, such as going out to buy things.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past ten years, Wu Kangren has starred in many word-of-mouth movies.

It has won awards at many international film festivals. Wu Kangren won this year&#39;s First Youth Award Best Actor at the Film Festival.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He received the First trophy in Xiamen, took a group photo, and then held it halfway. He was also the Best Actor in this year&#39;s First Film Festival media selection. When he heard that there were also trophies for the venue selection, he shook with joy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He cherishes every recognition he gets, whether it is an award or the favor of his seniors. This is why he often plays guest roles. : To repay a favor. He made a cameo appearance as a pervert who sexually harassed a female subordinate in the TV series &quot;Her and Her Her&quot;, but he couldn&#39;t find an actor for this disgusting role. Out of gratitude for the producer of the show who had taken care of him in the past, Wu Kangren took over the role. The original male lead of &quot;Copycat&quot; missed the appointment due to schedule, and the crew was at a standstill. They were in urgent need of a replacement who could be accepted by Netflix. It was Wu Kangren again. In order not to affect the follow-up film appointments, he rushed to work for 16 days in a row. He only sleeps two or three hours a day.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He thanked Chen Huiling, the director of &quot;Next Stop, Happiness&quot; many times. &quot;(To the director) jokingly said that there was no opportunity to perform in &quot;Next Stop&quot; at that time, maybe now I was still serving plates in restaurants and stuff like that, but I actually meant it. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2009, Wu Kangren starred in the idol drama &quot;Next Stop, Happiness&quot; as Hua Takuya, the second male lead who silently protected the heroine for many years and finally let go. He created a chapter in the history of Taiwanese idol dramas Classic: With tears in his eyes, he suppressed the sadness rushing out of his chest, and said to the heroine with a smile: &quot;Why, I was the one who met you first, but you still chose to lead him six years ago and six years later. hand. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/UfGy4Qfh5w7K2VHjG4Qa5ctSc3ksZ3zcvRcMN3h6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height =&quot;1024&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/UfGy4Qfh5w7K2VHjG4Qa5ctSc3ksZ3zcvRcMN3h6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259648&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot; color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Next Stop, Happiness (2009) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I watched it for the first time He was surprised when he was acting, how could someone crying be so touching. I asked director Chen Huiling, and the director said it was because he was acting with his life. &quot;said screenwriter Lu Shiyuan. Wu Kangren later became the leading actor in her works &quot;The Exit Office&quot; and &quot;The Distance Between Us and Evil&quot;. Both of these dramas brought Wu Kangren nominations for Best Actor at the Golden Bell Awards.&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;In this way, Wu Kangren, who had just quit his job as a bartender, emerged with &quot;Hua Tuoye&quot;. At the age of 27, he encountered his favorite job: acting. &quot;After acting reaches a certain stage, it is no longer for me. A way to make money for a living. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, &quot;Next Stop, Happiness&quot; was the last peak of Taiwanese idol dramas. Since then, Taiwanese dramas, which have been popular in Asia for ten years, have been declining. What is mutually responsible for the decline of Taiwanese dramas is that mainland TV dramas and Korean dramas gradually occupied Taiwanese TV stations, and Taiwanese dramas that lost their audience also lost the funds of the TV stations. It was also at that time that the backbone of Taiwanese dramas and future stars, such as Ethan Ruan, Zhao Youting, Chen Bolin, Ariel Ariel, Chen Qiaoen, etc., all turned to the mainland Development.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Newcomer Wu Kangren stayed in Taiwan and worked hard to act in his own way.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Like a foreign worker&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Starring &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; was won by Wu Kangren.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What he saw was the synopsis of the venture capital period.

Contact us.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the next eight months, Wu Kangren finished filming two movies and was resting at home. One day he was staring at his cat and suddenly felt that filming in Taiwan was out of his comfort zone, and he wanted to change places. He thought of &quot;Fudu Youth&quot;, so he called the director and asked if you were still filming and if you didn&#39;t plan to find me.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The director also told me honestly: they do have other candidates. . But I feel that I am very sincere and can go to Malaysia a month earlier and the (remuneration) can be cheaper. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Wu Kangren, &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; is a rare opportunity. Nowadays, professional dramas are popular in Taiwan. He has portrayed etiquette masters, lawyers, prosecutors, etc. He has also tried many unconventional characters, For example, mamasang, habitual thieves who steal women&#39;s underwear, etc. This is how he trains himself.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/25/oFjvo5nnR54pP2w1ScDw66JDokygZzTeBkAo528W.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/oFjvo5nnR54pP2w1ScDw66JDokygZzTe BkAo528W. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259639&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Fudu Youth (2023) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Fudu Youth&quot; is different. The people in the film have no career difficulties. They seem unconventional and marginal, but they actually exist in Malaysia. It tells the story of a pair of undocumented foreign workers. The brothers are living an ignoble existence in an old community in Fudu where foreign workers gather. The elder brother Abang (played by Wu Kangren) was born mute, and he works hard and accepts his fate. The younger brother Adi (played by Chen Zeyao) is unwilling to bow to fate. He only wants to make money and takes his brother with him. Leave this disgusting place.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Lilin is the producer of the movies &quot;Decibel Life&quot; and &quot;Lost Andy&quot;. When he was filming for &quot;Decibel Life&quot;, he observed that there were many problems in the Pudu community of Kuala Lumpur. Foreign workers, lonely elderly people, transgender people, etc. Three years later, he decided to shoot his first film with some unidentified people as the protagonists in the market of Fudu.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot; Since &quot;Decibel Life&quot;, I have wanted to be close to these people, and I feel very strongly about them. &quot;Wang Lilin said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This movie, from the director to the leading actors, followed the principle of &quot;really listening, seeing, and feeling.&quot; After Wu Kangren and Chen Zeyao worked in the market and learned sign language for about a month, the movie was released in Filming in Fudu has officially started.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fudu has a smell. The market where you work has the smell of fish, chicken and sweet fruits, and the enclosed building where you live has the smell of food, soap, sweat and Urine.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the film, there is a close-up scene of washing hands. Wu Kangren carefully rubs each fingernail. &quot;This is indeed an action I do every day at the end of the day, because the smell on my hands is so rich. &quot;Wu Kangren said, &quot;When I smoked, I smelled the smell of offal on my fingertips, so I thought, hey, I should wash it again. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The script gives branches, but the flesh and blood of the film depends on the actors themselves.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Abang makes a living by killing chickens and moving goods, so Wu Kangren killed chickens that were 20 days old— —Although the director initially did not plan to shoot a scene of killing a chicken. Eggs can be found by poking the butt of a chicken, and foreign workers often eat the eggs raw. They wanted to give them to Wu Kangren several times, and Wu Kangren repeatedly said, &quot;Thank you, thank you, thank you.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;Although the raw eggs were not eaten, Wu Kangren brought this detail into the movie: Abang, who came home from work, carried a bag of eggs and shared them with his neighbor and his daughter.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He wanted to let I am truly like a foreign worker in a rich city. Not only can I work, but I have also become black, thin and slovenly. &quot;When I first went there, I was like this now. I weighed more than 70 kilograms in vain. Don&#39;t spill the soup on me. appearance. &quot; He recalled, &quot;But when you really step into that market, you will find that everyone looks at you very differently, and you are out of place. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He imitated the state of foreign workers, unkempt, with sweat and animal blood on his body, and the look in his eyes was tired after repeating the action of killing chickens two hundred times a day. They collected money and handed over He had no energy to have more interactions with people.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He was killing chickens while approaching Fudu. He smoked, ate, and chatted with the foreign workers, looking at the expired passports they carried with them, and listening to their He talked about having a girlfriend or quarreling with his wife. He observed rats and said that he had never seen rats that looked like they had been trained. They ran past in groups, clanking and clanking, and dispersed like Moses parting the sea when they saw people. Together again.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he felt that there were no more eyes sizing him up, he knew that he could play Abang.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From May to August 2022, Wu Kangren completed filming continuously In &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; and the Hong Kong movie &quot;May I Live Forever&quot;, after four months of starvation, a 1.78 meter man lost weight to 53 kilograms. He did not want to say how much weight he had lost, after all, &quot;if the film was not filmed well , everyone thinks you are just thin, what’s the big deal?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/HR6YC0Q5tY8zSLc1MzpQtmSFEmEJMYfHTCgmVBXT .jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/HR6YC0Q5tY8zSLc1MzpQtmSFEmEJMYfHTCgmVBXT.jpg&quot; data-key =&quot;259640&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;May you live forever (2023) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the film comes to an end, Abang does not eat or drink in prison and wants to die. Wu Kangren also fasted to keep himself in a state of malaise that continues to decline.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He made fasting easy, saying that once he fasted his skin would be healed, white and smooth.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years, Wu Kangren&#39;s weight change curve, which has waxed and waned due to his acting roles, is a series of &quot;W&quot;s, at 30 kg The gap fluctuated between them. When he first lost weight rapidly for the movie &quot;Termites&quot; (2016), he was a little optimistic, thinking that if his body changed first, he would be able to observe the psychological changes. He was also a little intentional, thinking that this might be able to be used in acting. There are unexpected effects.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before becoming an actor, he sweated and sweated on the construction site and got paid, so he firmly believed that hard work would be rewarded. He washed cups in the kitchen and had to work on the countertop and off stage. Just as clean, this later even became his belief: I, Wu Kangren, show you the same in person as I do in private. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same goes for getting fatter and thinner. No one knew what to gain by acting like this, but he wanted to know; he&#39;d tried it, so he knew the power of shape-shifting. &quot;I&#39;m quite fortunate to have done this. It helped me a lot.&quot; He said, &quot;This is irreplaceable and is self-cultivation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Mute&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; h4>; &lt;p>;When &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; was finalized, the crew gave Wu Kangren a cake, and he started crying when he saw the cake. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I can finally eat!&quot; He said that he was so excited that he cried. &quot;I went to eat chicken the day after the filming was completed!&quot; Once again, Wu Kangren solved the difficulty with a joke. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before Abang was executed, the prison arranged for him to meet with the Master for his final confession. In this play, the director gave full play to &quot;listening, watching, and feeling&quot;: Wu Kangren&#39;s script only has the word &quot;accusation&quot; and no lines; the master is a real eminent monk, Master Kaizhao who has been preaching Buddhism to death row prisoners for more than 30 years. , and there is no script. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Kangren and the director rehearsed the scene more than thirty times, trying to understand why Abang had such a strong reaction to release himself in such a situation. &quot;We can imagine that he will have a display of strength in the end, but we didn&#39;t understand where the base point of strength is.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/11/25/PnousbgA6PNRLpQfUXmEoJ692wqpfd4Yaarsu6IS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/ 25/PnousbgA6PNRLpQfUXmEoJ692wqpfd4Yaarsu6IS.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259641&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Fudu Youth (2023) &lt;span style=&quot;color: # aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the long preparation period and the shooting in chronological order, the actors have enough time to integrate into the characters, so when Wu Kangren heard Master Kaizhao say &quot;live well&quot; , suddenly mourning Abang endlessly. &quot;Living well is the most difficult thing for him. What seems simple to us is a luxury for them. So we must start from this sentence.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Abang and Adi cannot rent The house often wakes up from sleep in the middle of the night to avoid inspection; it is impossible to open a bank account, and all the working money is kept in a rusty cookie box; I cannot buy a motorcycle because I cannot get a driver&#39;s license, so I can only take the bus or walk everywhere. Without status, they will always be forced to work as laborers in Fudu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Abang once encountered love, but it was fleeting; he once thought he could live a stable life with his brother in Fudu, but his fate overturned it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But they also had their happy moments. Abang, Adi and Sister Money, a transgender person, depend on each other - in Malaysia, transgender people have no identity in another sense - they eat together and dance together. Three people hit their heads with eggs at the dinner table, screaming and laughing in pain. This is Wu Kangren&#39;s favorite scene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I think the most precious thing is the smiles in life. Throughout the play, they rarely smile, and the things that are taken for granted in life are too harsh for them.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, Facing Master Kaizhao, Abang complained: I always wonder why I was born, I have no home, I don’t even have parents, I can only watch from a distance. I&#39;m jealous of you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I want to be like you. But I can&#39;t! Why is this? I want to talk, I want to be loved and liked, but there is nothing. You told me not to give up, to keep living. But I can&#39;t do it at all. I always have to be careful, alert, hiding, running away. It&#39;s not fair, I did something wrong.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;My life is terrible and I want to change my life, but Impossible. I have no future.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These accusations were made in sign language and facial expressions. The expressions on those who carefully observed the surroundings, the echo of the wrist chain hitting the table, and the tears that had been rolling in the eye sockets for a long time but did not fall, all made this silent accusation deafening. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Don&#39;t preach to me, I have no identity.&quot; Abang pointed to the code on his prison uniform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Master Kaizhao suddenly held Abang’s hand. Abang calmed down, tears fell, and he sobbed out incomprehensible syllables: &quot;I want to die, I want to die, I want...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He looked around and found that no one could understand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Abang is mute, which is a fateful coupling. &quot;A group of people without identity are just like the mute. Even if they speak out, there will be no change.&quot; Wu Kangren said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Chen Zeyao, who played the younger brother, later saw this silent accusation on the screen, he was shocked and hurt, &quot;It turns out that this is what Abang thinks. It turns out that he has always felt that he is a shadow. I can&#39;t be with you.&quot; I talk too much about my inner feelings because it really hurts.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the scene where the brothers bid farewell, Chen Zeyao instinctively expressed his feelings for his brother in sign language. &quot;I burst into tears and forgot to say my lines. Later I found out that everyone can feel it even if I don&#39;t say my lines.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Abang, next time, I say next time, I will be your brother to protect you.&quot; Adi said. More than 20 years ago, street children Abang and Adi met on the street and became brothers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Wang Lilin, the &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; presented now has fulfilled his expectations. &quot;I want to talk about human emotions in the context of foreign workers in Fudu, and the precious warmth and goodwill between people in such a cruel and oppressive society.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;What about Wu Kangren, right? What can we expect from &quot;Fudu Youth&quot;?&quot; we asked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Just don&#39;t lose money, it&#39;s a movie they worked so hard to make.&quot; He replied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The day after filming wrapped, Wu Kangren posted on social media: &quot;We have done a great thing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/23/11/25/1Mj220voE9O4TyIqiVik3Kr0yE1Alckh7WTsQfLg.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;686&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/11/25/1Mj220voE9O4TyIqiVik3Kr0yE1Alckh7WTsQfLg.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259642&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa; &quot;>;(Wu Kangren’s personal social media account/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Clap your hands&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2016, Wu Kangren won the first prize with his role in &quot;A Handful of Youth&quot; The role of &quot;Guo Zhen&quot; won the Golden Bell Award for Best Actor. This is one of the most successful characters he has created, mixed with a cynical sense of youth and the vicissitudes of war and life and death, and with deep love for his lover, he was extinguished in the gunfire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;His acceptance speech was like a plea: a plea for more resources for actors, a plea for TV stations to develop more different types of dramas. &quot;They (actors) are waiting, just like me before, waiting for someone like Director Cho Sei-won to choose me. We need more resources to help us. Maybe we are not the most talented, but we can always be the most talented. The one who works hard.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/6cdQYotwZsx1KCe1gvLjXjL3iGl88Q4QZOBu9i37.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width= &quot;960&quot; height=&quot;673&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/6cdQYotwZsx1KCe1gvLjXjL3iGl88Q4QZOBu9i37.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259645&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt; p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A handful of green (2015) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relying on government subsidies and Later, with the investment of streaming media platforms, Taiwanese dramas have been innovative in the past few years. Around 2015, &quot;A Handful of Youth&quot; and the genre dramas &quot;Exit Office&quot; and &quot;Narcotic Storm&quot; were regarded as the first new trend. After 2019, dramas that focus on social issues, such as &quot;The Distance Between Us&quot; and &quot;The Distance Between Us&quot;, mark that Taiwanese dramas have basically passed the trough period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the above -mentioned Taiwanese dramas, Wu Kuangren all picked up the beam. From idol dramas to realism, his acting career overlaps with the ups and downs, changes and breakthroughs of Taiwanese dramas in the past 15 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;To be honest, I became famous because there was a shortage of people (filming) in Taiwan at that time. There were not many Taiwanese actors my age.&quot; He said in an interview with &quot;Taiwan Film&quot; at the end of 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he entered the industry, he thought that he was not outstanding in appearance and qualifications, but &quot;hard work is more important than talent.&quot; When he was working as a bartender, he didn&#39;t speak English, so after finishing work in the early morning, he would go to the all-night Eslite Bookstore, read bartending books, and memorize words in Pinyin. Many years later, when the media interviewed the bar owner, the bar owner described Wu Kangren as &quot;a life on the line&quot;: a lifetime of hard work for one thing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He went through phases of conceitedness. He knows what he is doing, he gives 200%, is strict with himself, and requires everyone around him to work as hard as he does. &quot;I used to be quite radical at work, so there were rumors that Wu Kangren was difficult to deal with. Only in the past two years have I gradually realized that this is a team work.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But precisely because Wu Kangren always emphasized hard work, He often says that he is not talented enough, and few people talk about his talent as an actor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He has beautiful eyes and expressive features, which makes him good at performing explosive moments with complex emotions. He is good at observation and describes many details of the old district of Fudu vividly and vividly. Although he is taciturn and serious in daily life, when standing on the stage and in front of the camera, he is talkative and humorous, with rich expressions and body movements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He is confident that he can persist in acting and yearns to be a good actor like Li Xuejian for a lifetime, but he is also not optimistic about his career as an actor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I don&#39;t think I will always be able to act. I just want to be exposed to many possibilities earlier and faster. It may only take three to five years to act in a film. I strive for it because of fate.&quot; He thought for a while and said, &quot;You won&#39;t see &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; again in five years. I have been in the industry for 15 years and only saw &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; once.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is This is the reason why he tried a variety of unconventional roles after 2015. He wanted to know how many possibilities he had and how to improve his performance. He went to training classes to practice his vocal skills; he filmed 5 movies in 2022 and felt very at ease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps because he does not have an agent, Wu Kangren has limited access to film resources. He has expressed his love for mainland art films several times, and he also admitted that he respects acting in mainland China. &quot;You have to be prepared before going, not just to make money and leave.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But it is also because Without an agent, Wu Kangren makes all his work decisions by himself. After experiencing a period of panic, he is now very accustomed to this way of working: he knows what is important, and he just needs to perform well. He can take care of himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He yearns for Hong Kong actors in the golden age of Hong Kong films, such as Tony Leung Ka-fai, Tony Leung Chiu-wai, and Andy Lau. &quot;Each actor has accumulated hundreds of films and has his own place.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/3ps1FPdK7ZJ6bSD1hSXs9Jb3QbmFYuu7aYJgorhx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src =&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/3ps1FPdK7ZJ6bSD1hSXs9Jb3QbmFYuu7aYJgorhx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259647&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text- align: center;&quot;>;In My Lifetime (2023) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The title of &quot;In My Lifetime&quot; is Gao Jiayue&#39;s life summary. Gao Jiayue scrawled and corrected it and wrote on the back of the &quot;suicide note&quot;: It would be good to grow this big in my lifetime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Kangren started working at the age of 14. The first job was to do electrical box welding with bare eyes. After work, my vision was so white that I thought I was going blind. Since then, he has worked more than 50 jobs, shuttling between 20-story scaffolding without safety helmets and safety nets, washing dishes, cutting vegetables, and entertaining guests in various restaurants. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Twenty years later, Wu Kangren was asked what he wanted to say to himself at that time. He replied:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;15-year-old Wu Kangren, the things you were afraid of at that time, None of this happened, because you didn’t learn bad things, and you are taking good care of your mother now. Your decision at that time was right, and you got a wonderful life in exchange for it, so give yourself a pat on the back.”&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;He raised his hands above his head and clapped himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 26 Nov 2023 10:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[首位博士说丨林超民：研究历史才能看到未来]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261332]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-26 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 2, 2023, Lin Chaomin was at the Wu Mayao Anthropology Museum of Yunnan University.

It is close to Green Lake. Every winter, you can see the scenery from A red-billed gull flies from Siberia to spend the winter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1962, Lin Chaomin was admitted to Yunnan University as a history major. At that time, the Department of History gathered together scholars such as Fang Guoyu, Jiang Yingliang, Yang Kun, and Li Wei to establish the first Chinese ethnic history major. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The first time he came into contact with the ethnic history major in a relatively systematic way was due to the &quot;special task&quot; Lin Chaomin was assigned before graduation: Fang Guoyu, who would become his mentor in the future. Collect &quot;evidence of guilt&quot; from his writings. Yunda University students only have 6 library cards, but Lin Chaomin, who shoulders the &quot;task&quot;, after receiving 20 library cards, plunged into Fang Guoyu&#39;s works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As a result, &quot;After reading for a long time, I didn&#39;t find anything reactionary about Mr. Fang, but I myself became interested in the study of national history.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Later, due to various reasons, this class of history students who were full of expectations for the future were collectively sent to farms for re-education after six years of undergraduate studies. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In May 1970, Lin Chaomin was assigned to work as a worker in the Menghai Tea Factory in Xishuangbanna Province, and later taught in Menghai No. 1 Middle School. During this period, he was appreciated by Ren Jiyu, professor of the Department of Philosophy at Peking University, for an article discussing Confucius&#39; thoughts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1978, Lin Chaomin was 33 years old. He heard that he could take the postgraduate entrance examination, so he thought of the Chinese Ethnic History major at Yunnan University. But compared with the exam, getting people released from middle school was more difficult. “I went to the then county party secretary Yan Xiangkan, who was from the Blang ethnic group. When he heard that I was going to study ethnic history, I immediately Said, &#39;I hope you will study the history of our Brown people carefully.&#39;&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some people once commented that Lin Chaomin was &quot;a pioneer in the trend.&quot; In 1985, he passed the defense , became the first doctorate in Chinese national history. One of his mentors, Jiang Yingliang, has a plan for him: &quot;He is expected to make creative achievements in the study of ethnic history. We hope that he will not be held in administrative affairs, which will affect his research and teaching.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, after graduating from the Ph.D., he was immediately appointed as the deputy director of the History Department of Yunnan University, and later served as the vice president of Yunnan University. As an administrator, he once faced the question of where the history department should go in the face of the decline of liberal arts. At that time, in the context of difficulty in recruiting students, allocating resources, and generating income, many teachers called the history department a &quot;shit pit&quot; and shouted that they should jump out of the &quot;shit pit.&quot; pit&quot;. During his tenure, Lin Chaomin successively organized and applied for history base classes, established anthropology, social work and other majors, and established the first Institute of Film and Television Anthropology in Asia, allowing this university located in the southwest border to seize the opportunity in the discipline establishment. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After retirement, Lin Chaomin can spend time on research. In recent years, he has paid special attention to the integrity of Chinese history. On October 28, 2023, he organized a seminar on Fang Guoyu&#39;s historical thoughts to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the publication of the theory &quot;On the Integration of Chinese Historical Development&quot; and the 120th anniversary of Fang Guoyu&#39;s birth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 2, 2023, on the campus of Yunnan University, Lin Chaomin accepted an exclusive interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Lin Chaomin&#39;s doctoral thesis defense scene, taken in 1985.

When the Japanese occupied Tengchong in 1942, my parents fled to Dali, where I was born. After the Chinese Expeditionary Force recaptured Tengchong in September 1944, we came back from Dali. At that time, Tengchong was bombed by aircraft and artillery due to the Anti-Japanese War. The city was in rubble, with almost no standing house. The central primary school where we study is the Confucian Temple. The Japanese used it as a headquarters before. It has been preserved because of its strong construction. There are still many bullet holes in the walls and pillars inside. When I was in sixth grade, the school was building a sports ground and we dug up a lot of bullet casings and bayonets from Type 38 rifles. It wasn’t until I graduated from high school in 1962 and entered college that I left Tengchong. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When I was young, I didn’t know what to do, I just knew that I wanted to read good books. At that time, my mother subscribed to different magazines for each age group of us brothers and sisters. For example, when I was very young, I read &quot;Children&quot;, &quot;Red Scarf&quot;, &quot;Middle School Students&quot; and &quot;Youth Literature&quot;. Later, when I was older, I read &quot;Students&quot; published in the Republic of China. Youwenku&quot;. At that time, I read Lin Handa&#39;s &quot;New Collection of Stories from the Eastern Zhou Dynasty&quot;, &quot;New Collection of Stories from the Later and Later Han Dynasties&quot;, &quot;Stories of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, &quot;Tai Shi Not Afraid of Death&quot;, etc., and developed a strong interest in history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why did you apply in the end?

Roads, ditches, reservoirs, he often told me that after the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China, the motherland must be industrialized, and you should study engineering and work hard for modernization. My mother was a middle school teacher. During the anti-rightist movement in 1957, many liberal arts teachers in Tengchong No. 1 Middle School were misclassified. My mother said that we could not study liberal arts because it would be easy to make mistakes, so I always wanted to study science and engineering. Later, my mother also advocated that I study medicine because it would be useful at any time. In high school, I was good in all subjects, but I excelled in liberal arts. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I was a senior in high school in 1962. After the graduation exam last semester, the school divided us into three groups according to the subjects we applied for. One group was science and engineering. The other group is medicine and agriculture, and the other group is liberal arts. My family decided to choose science and engineering, but when it came to the specific subjects, I was assigned to the liberal arts group under the arrangement of the head teacher, Chinese teacher, and history teacher. At that time, I went to Baoshan, Yunnan to take the college entrance examination, and I sent out application letters before the exam. Each person can fill in five choices, so I filled out the history departments of Peking University, Renmin University of China, Nanjing University, Fudan and Yunda University, and was later admitted to Yunda University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why was Yunda University at that time Is the history department a &quot;five-year system&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Lin Chaomin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Our history department only had one major: history, and we recruited 32 people. Only one-half of the previous one, and one-third of the previous one. The curriculum arrangement is that the first, second and third grade students take basic courses, such as ancient literature, politics, foreign languages, Chinese and foreign general history, etc., and the fourth grade is divided into &quot;specialized (groups)&quot;. When I was studying, there were three special groups: Chinese national history, ancient Chinese economic history, and modern Chinese economic history. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I didn’t study well when I was in college. Since 1958, labor education has been relatively common in universities. The central government formulated the Sixty Articles for Higher Education, emphasizing the emphasis on teaching. At that time, the Ministry of Education stipulated that students should attend labor classes for five weeks in a school year, which implied that it could not exceed five weeks. But in reality it’s more than five weeks of labor each school year. At that time, Yunnan University had three farms, growing rice, corn, wheat, vegetables, as well as apple orchards and pig farms. In addition, there was a lot of public welfare work, such as planting trees in the mountains, and supporting spring plowing and autumn harvesting during busy farming periods. Later, when Kunming was building a railway station, we were asked to help. In 1961, after a survey, the Ministry of Higher Education found that students had to work and go to school at the same time, and could not learn much in four years, so they decided to turn key universities into five-year institutions, and Yunda University was also changed to a five-year institution. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You studied under Mr. Fang Guoyu when you were a graduate student because you went to Fang Sir&#39;s class? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lin Chaomin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When I was in college, Mr. Fang was responsible for the national task of compiling the southwest part of China’s historical map. He only teaches graduate students, and ethnic history is a senior professional course that is only taken in the fourth grade and is taught by his assistants Mr. You Zhong and Mr. Mu Qin. On April 20, 1963, Mr. Fang gave a speech on &quot;On the Integration of China&#39;s Historical Development&quot; at school. I met him for the first time, but because he was from Lijiang and of the Naxi ethnic group, he had a strong accent and I didn&#39;t understand much. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But I was deeply impressed after reading the article. In September 1966, when I was a senior in college, classes were suspended again due to the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, and the school began to engage in mass criticism to criticize reactionary academic authority. At that time, Yunnan University established a large criticism group, which included a Chinese group and a history group. The history group mainly criticized the &quot;three mountains&quot; of the history department. The first one was Fang Guoyu who &quot;represented&quot; feudalism, and the second one was &quot; Jiang Yingliang (who once served as county magistrate in Che, now Jinghong) represents &quot;bureaucratic capitalism&quot;, and the third one &quot;represents&quot; imperialism is Yang Kun (studied at the University of Sino-French in Lyon, France). There are five or six classmates in the history group I am in. The group members do not need to study in the department. Two young teachers organize us to go to these old gentlemen&#39;s books and find questions from the books. The average college student only has 6 library cards. , our criticism group has 20 library cards, and can go into the library to check books. It was also at this time that I dug out all of Mr. Fang&#39;s works and read them. His &quot;Inspection Notes on the Western Yunnan Border Area&quot; talked about his field trips to the Awa Mountains in the Lincang border area. I was very interested in reading it and felt that it was well written. Very good, no problems found. I didn’t write an article criticizing Mr. Fang. Instead, I learned about the social history of border areas and the customs and customs of ethnic minorities, and felt that his &quot;On the Integration of Chinese Historical Development&quot; and other articles were good articles for safeguarding national unity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Fang Guoyu (first from left) instructs Lin Chaomin (second from left), photographed in Professor Fang Guoyu&#39;s study in March 1973.

The more popular ones are in the modern history group. Every school has party history. Courses are in great demand for employment. Previously, all students majoring in modern history were assigned to the General Political Department of the People&#39;s Liberation Army. In addition, many people go to the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (now the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences). At that time, Yunda University&#39;s ethnic history major was ranked first in the country. Those who studied the history of Dai, Yi, Bai, and Naxi people in the Institute of Ethnology of the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences were all Yunda graduates. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Logically speaking, we should have graduated in July 1967, but until October 1968, except for a few in agriculture and medicine, our group of college students Except for majors, all were sent to farms to receive re-education and labor training. It was not until April 1970 that work began to be assigned. At that time, it was stipulated that college students should achieve &quot;four orientations&quot;, facing the grassroots, facing the countryside, facing the industry and mining, and facing the frontier. At the time of the distribution, no one wanted to go to Xishuangbanna. I read Mr. Fang&#39;s &quot;Inspection Notes on the Western Yunnan Border Region&quot;, Mr. Jiang Yingliang&#39;s &quot;Economic Life of the Paiyi&quot;, &quot;Life and Culture of the Paiyi&quot;, etc., and I was very interested in the border ethnic groups, so I Take the initiative to sign up to go to Xishuangbanna. In May 1970, when I arrived in Menghai County, Xishuangbanna, I was assigned to be a worker in the Menghai Tea Factory. I was transferred to the factory from time to time to write work summaries, publicity reports, etc. In 1972, Menghai No. 1 Middle School opened a high school and needed high school teachers, but the factory refused to let them go. It wasn’t until 1973 that I was transferred as a history and Chinese teacher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I heard you are When working at the Menghai Tea Factory, he was also appreciated by Professor Ren Jiyu of Peking University? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Lin Chaomin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I work 8 hours a day in the tea factory, and the rest of the time is my own. When I was in college, I was very interested in the history of Chinese thought. I read Hou Wailu&#39;s &quot;General History of Chinese Thought&quot;, Zhao Jibin&#39;s &quot;A New Exploration of the Analects&quot;, Guo Moruo&#39;s &quot;Ten Critiques&quot;, etc., and took notes. When I went to Menghai, I brought a copy of the &quot;Four Books&quot; with me. In his spare time, he wrote an article about Confucius&#39; thought and sent it to Professor Li Cuo in the department for his advice. He gave the article to Professor Zhang Deguang, an expert in the history of ancient Chinese thought, and Mr. Zhang recommended it to Ren Jiyu. Mr. Ren wrote me back a letter, saying that in a remote place like Xishuangbanna, it was not easy for me to persist in studying Confucius and write such an article. However, he also pointed out that my article did not criticize Confucius enough. Mr. Ren also sent me a copy of &quot;A Brief History of Chinese Philosophy&quot; edited by him. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1972, Mr. Ren wrote to me and told me that Peking University was preparing to recruit 10 graduate students in the history of Chinese philosophy. He hoped that I would be ready. Admitted to his graduate school. So I studied foreign languages ​​every day, systematically studied the history of Chinese philosophy, and often wrote to him for advice. But then the Zhang Tiesheng hand-in-the-blank incident happened, and Mr. Ren wrote to me to tell me that the recruitment of graduate students had been stopped, and that in the future, graduate students would also be recruited through the recommendation of workers, peasants and soldiers. I wouldn&#39;t have a chance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Until 1978, it was restored During the postgraduate enrollment period, you were finally able to take the postgraduate entrance examination, but why didn’t you contact Professor Ren Jiyu again? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lin Chaomin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I also thought about writing to Mr. Ren and doing research on the history of philosophy with him, but I was in Xishuangbanna at the time, and my thoughts changed.

Later, when I became a middle school teacher, some students asked me questions about ethnic minorities, and I couldn’t answer them. , at this time, I remembered the research on ethnic minorities by Mr. Fang Guoyu and Mr. Jiang Yingliang. I felt that there were more people doing the history of philosophy in the country, but too few people doing the history of ethnic groups, which was not popular, so I chose to study under Mr. Fang’s graduate school. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;In the 1960s, Lin Chaomin planted vegetables and watered vegetables at the PLA farm.

I didn’t understand it at that time. When I was reporting, he asked me how many books I had read. I said I had only read a few books, and he said it’s not good for you to read books like this. I read them one book at a time, but flipped through the bookshelves one by one. He asked me to start with bibliography and read books such as &quot;Summary of the General Catalog of All Siku&quot;, &quot;Diagnosis of Synopsis of Siku&quot; by Yu Jiaxi, and &quot;Answers to the Bibliography&quot; by Zhang Zhidong. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Mr. Fang has never criticized me directly. When I was studying for my master&#39;s degree, I wrote some small articles in &quot;Yunnan Daily&quot;. Mr. Fang just said, You haven&#39;t read enough books yet. What you posted in &quot;Yunnan Daily&quot; is just a trivial skill, building blocks. Your task is to build a tall building.

He does not advocate rushing to publish articles and believes that first Read good books. He said that no article should be refried, and if there is no new idea, don’t write an article. He said that some people nowadays do not study seriously, but are busy writing articles, rushing to publish articles, and eager for quick success. Many articles are about stir-fried twice-cooked pork. This won&#39;t work! Doctoral students do not use pigs raised by others to make steamed pork, Qianzhang pork, or braised pork. Instead, they have to cultivate new pig species themselves, create something, and invent something. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Later, I summarized doctoral studies as having all five &quot;unique&quot; aspects.

In 1939, Mr. Fang wrote &quot;Bo People and Baizi&quot; and published it in &quot;Yi Shi Bao&quot;, criticizing the fallacy of the British and French in describing Nanzhao as an independent country established by the Dai people. His study of border issues was not only In order to examine historical issues, but to maintain national unity and national unity. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1963, Mr. Fang published &quot;On the Integration of China&#39;s Historical Development&quot; and began to talk about the integrity of China&#39;s historical development. The article aims at the absurd remarks of some scholars at home and abroad who regard Chinese history as a single history of the Han people and exclude the history of non-Han Chinese ethnic minorities from Chinese history. It points out that the development of Chinese history has always been a whole, and that history and reality, the Central Plains and the Central Plains are The border areas, the Han and ethnic minorities, the Chinese nation, etc. are all one entity. Chinese history refers to the history of the people of all ethnic groups living on this land. It should include their entire history and cannot be &quot;changed or expanded.&quot; Chinese history has its own integrity. Within the whole, no matter how many regimes appear and no matter how inconsistent the politics, the whole has not been broken. China as a whole should be the scope of history, not the territory of past dynasties. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Later I assisted Mr. Fang in teaching the local history of Yunnan, and he reiterated this point of view in the introduction to &quot;Lecture Notes on the Local History of Yunnan&quot;. When Yunnan University celebrated its 70th anniversary in 1983, he guided me to write an article called &quot;Several Issues Related to the Thirty-seven Alliance Oath Monuments in Dali&quot;, which also used this monument to talk about the unification of Chinese history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From an international perspective , some historians may also hold other views on the unified view of history. How should we understand the border issue? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Lin Chaomin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Border issues are relatively complex. In the past, China had no border issues, only the relationship between China and the four barbarians, which meant the &quot;five-party republic&quot; between China and the four barbarians and &quot;the unification of the world, the seamless connection between China and barbarians&quot;. From the central to the local governments, they were one whole. Even during the period of division, both Han and ethnic minorities pursued &quot;unification of the world&quot; and regarded the dynasties they established as Chinese orthodoxy; the dynasty systems they established were based on inheriting the Qin and Han systems and did not change the overall Economic, political, and cultural structures. Because all ethnic groups have lived together for a long time, they have already formed a complementary and unified production and lifestyle, which has given birth to a very inclusive and absorbing Chinese civilization, allowing the Chinese nation to form a strong cohesion based on &quot;commonality&quot;. Even during the period of division, this way of production and life has not changed, the political system has not changed, the overall consciousness has not changed, and the culture has continued. This is reflected in the national outlook and national outlook as the &quot;grand unified&quot; national outlook and the overall consciousness of the Chinese nation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Modern frontier studies began to rise because of the arrival of Western colonialism from the East. The first is the political &quot;frontier&quot;. In history, the division and reunification of many places was a process of development. For example, Yunnan was Nanzhao in the Tang Dynasty. In the 10th year of Zhenyuan (794), the Yunnan Pacifying Department was established, and the Jiannan Jiedushi was appointed as the Yunnan Pacifying Envoy. It is an autonomous local government. Dali State was also an autonomous local government. Mongolia pacified Dali in 1253, and the Yuan Dynasty established a province in Yunnan in 1274. The Yuan Dynasty also established the province of Myanmar, which was later placed under the administration of Yunnan Province. It is a chieftain land under the jurisdiction of Yunnan Province. After the founding of New China, the China-Myanmar border was officially delimited in 1961. China erected the No. 1 boundary monument of the People&#39;s Republic of China on the border with Tengchong. Indicates that we formally respect the demarcation of borders under international law, that is, borders under international law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are also cultural borders. For example, the culture of the Wa people in China and the Wa state in northern Myanmar have many similarities. Although there are political boundaries at this time, But in fact, we all have the same culture and history, and we are a community with a shared future. Therefore, from a domestic perspective, it is the integrity of the Chinese nation, and from a foreign perspective, it should be regarded as a community. Domestically, we safeguard China&#39;s integrity and safeguard national unity. Internationally, we build a community with a shared future for mankind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Lin Chaomin&#39;s doctoral thesis is entitled &quot;Anbeiting Protectorate and the Western Frontier of the Tang Dynasty&quot;, taken in 1985.

Each department wants to generate income. Teachers in the Department of Economics and Foreign Languages, for example, can give lectures and tutors to earn extra money. Although the salary is the same, their extra money is several times that of ours. At that time, some teachers majoring in history said that they should think beyond the &quot;shit&quot; pit&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Students&#39; thoughts were not very stable, so I put forward a point of view. History may seem useless, but useless things are very useful. I told the students that the tables, chairs, benches, doors, windows, and lights in the classroom are all useful, but what is invisible and useless is the space. But without this space, there would be nowhere to put the tables, chairs, benches, and lights. History is human time and space. You can&#39;t see or touch it, but you can&#39;t live without it at all times. It&#39;s very useful anytime and anywhere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Later, the Ministry of Education proposed to build 10 &quot;bases&quot; in each of the three major categories of literature, history, and philosophy. When the document was issued to the school, it was less than the application deadline. For 5 days, I filled out the application form day and night, and stated at the review meeting that Yunnan University is a border university, inferior to Peking University, Fudan University, etc. in many aspects, but its research on border issues and ethnic issues is unique in the country and is related to national unity. , national unity, which is irreplaceable by other schools. The characteristics of the History Department of Yunda University are borderlands and ethnic groups, which cannot be replaced by any other school. In this way, in 1987, Yunda University became one of the 10 bases. The base class has brought new opportunities to Yunda University. The state invests 300,000 yuan in construction funds for the base class every year, and more than half of the students can be recommended to graduate school. Employment after graduation is no longer a problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Later, you also Did you encounter any difficulties in establishing the ethnology and social work majors? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Lin Chaomin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 1986, I proposed that Yunda University should establish an ethnology major, and the school leaders were very supportive. , reported to the Yunnan Provincial Education Commission, the Education Commission said that ethnology is run by the Nationalities College, and it is not appropriate to have two ethnology majors in one province. In the end, it was not completed. Later, I rewrote the report and applied to establish the anthropology major. In 1987, the State Education Commission approved Yunda to establish the anthropology major. We are the second anthropology major in a national university. The first one is Xiamen University, and the first one with an anthropology department is Sun Yat-sen University. In 1988, we enrolled the first batch of undergraduate students. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the Anthropology major was established in 1988, I began to plan to apply for the Sociology major. In July 1939, Wu Wenzao founded the Department of Sociology at Yunda. By 1954, the Department of Sociology was revoked. At that time, the director of the department was Mr. Yang Yan. In 1984 and 1986, I visited Mr. Yang twice at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Mr. Yang repeatedly told me that it was wrong to abolish the Department of Sociology and that it should be restored and rebuilt as soon as possible. I brought his opinions back to school and reported them to the leaders. Although they were ignored, I always kept his words in mind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In October 1990, I visited the United States to study. I knew that social work is a major that is very needed by society. Social development will bring many problems and requires specialized professionals. Social workers come to the rescue. Both rich and poor have social problems. When I passed through Hong Kong when I returned to China, I went to some universities to learn about the social work major. One of their social work features is to help disadvantaged groups, the poor, the unemployed, the disabled, etc. After I came back, I told the school that if the sociology major could not be offered, we would not be able to offer it. Social work major. At that time, most people in the academic affairs office of the school did not know what social work was, so I explained it over and over again. After the school agreed, it was reported to the Provincial Education Commission and the National Education Commission, and it was quickly approved. We were the successor of Nankai University and China Youth University of Political Science. The third house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Have you given What advice do you have for current college students, especially history students? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Lin Chaomin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The current academic atmosphere is too utilitarian. I often tell students that if they want to make a fortune, Just do business, be an official if you want fame, be willing to be poor if you want to be a scholar, be indifferent to fame and fortune, be content to live on the margins, immerse yourself in learning, think independently, and innovate alone. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Human beings are creating history, so they must write and record history. Only by studying history can we see the future. History is the memory of mankind. People, societies and countries cannot live without memory. Without memory, a nation has no soul and cannot see its direction. History is useless, but its usefulness is great. Just like air, we can&#39;t see or touch it, but we can&#39;t live without it for a moment. We study history in order to create the future. To move forward, we can only ask about history; only by learning from history can we create the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend intern Huang Xiaoying also contributed to this article)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; /p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https:// feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 26 Nov 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
