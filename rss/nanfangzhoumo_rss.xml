Provided assistance with matters such as job promotion and job promotion, and illegally received property equivalent to more than RMB 83.61 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Zhangzhou Intermediate People’s Court held that the defendant Gong Jianhua’s behavior constituted the crime of accepting bribes, and the amount of bribes he accepted was particularly huge. In view of the fact that Gong Jianhua truthfully confessed his crime after voluntarily surrendering to the case, and voluntarily confessed some bribery facts that were not yet known to the case-handling agency, he had the circumstances to surrender, confessed and repented, and actively returned the stolen goods. All the bribery proceeds and their accruals have been sealed, detained, and frozen in the case, which is legal. , determine the circumstances of lenient punishment, and he may be punished leniently in accordance with the law. The court then made the above judgment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 22:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一次本不公开的学术不端自查]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256962]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/19/l2wuCqI3gXizKDKZ0fxN0vyIVL3nh27B3yxPJUsd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1082&quot; height=&quot;865&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/l2wuCqI3gXizKDKZ0fxN0vyIVL3 nh27B3yxPJUsd. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251170&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2020, during an academic conference, Li Wei (pseudonym), a professor at the School of Physical Education of Shihezi University, casually agreed to a friend’s request for a paper name. It was a paper related to swimming. In 2021, a third-party agency discovered that the paper was suspected of being synthesized by reverse translation software and reported it to the Ministry of Education for confirmation, and the Ministry of Education fed back the situation to Shihezi University. The school launched an investigation and sent a letter to the other school, and found that Li Wei, the corresponding author, had not previously known about the existence of this article. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Wei was punished and could not participate in various project applications and evaluations for three years. During the ongoing self-examination of academic misconduct in college theses and the cleanup of false claims, Li Wei was reported again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beginning in late May 2023, many universities have successively announced the launch of self-examination and cleanup of academic misconduct in papers, requiring self-examination and cleanup of academic papers since January 2018. Previously, on April 27, 2023, the General Office of the Ministry of Science and Technology issued a self-examination notice, requiring universities and scientific research institutes to self-examine and clean up common academic misconduct including plagiarism, plagiarism, forged peer reviews, ghostwriting and investment, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters noted that the main purpose of self-examination is to reduce the stock of academic misconduct papers and strive to curb the increase. &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: line-through;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a self-examination operation that was not intended to be made public. Southern Weekend reporters learned from people close to the Ministry of Science and Technology that the notice only became known to the outside world because two universities posted the notice as an attachment online. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The self-examination document is “not public &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to the notices issued by each school, the main objects of this self-examination are These are all academic papers published by teachers and students of the school as the first signed unit. The focus areas of self-examination are basically the same, and they are all relatively common academic misconduct. It mainly includes six categories: plagiarism, plagiarism, and duplication of publications; forging corresponding authors, forging or manipulating peer reviews; forging, fabricating, and tampering with experimental data and pictures, using one picture for multiple purposes, and selective use; buying, selling, and ghostwriting papers; and purchasing experiments. Research data; nominal phenomenon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the notice of the Ministry of Science and Technology, universities and scientific research institutes in all provinces should carry out self-examination and clean-up work. However, according to incomplete statistics from Southern Weekend reporters, only nearly 30 universities, including Shihezi University, Qinghai University, and Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture, have issued this notice on their official websites. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned from people close to the Ministry of Science and Technology that the aforementioned Ministry of Science and Technology notice was originally a non-public document, but it became known to the outside world after two universities posted it online as an attachment to the notice. In fact, the notice documents issued by the Jiangsu and Anhui Provincial Science and Technology Departments did state &quot;This matter will not be made public&quot; at the end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a top-down campaign to investigate academic misconduct. Southern Weekend reporters tried to contact nearly 30 universities that publicly released the notice. Among them, Shihezi University, Qinghai University, Southwest University of Science and Technology and Yanshan University were interviewed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, different universities have slightly different self-examination methods. However, they all adopt the method of teachers filling in forms and reporting by themselves. The content of the form mainly contains the personal information of the self-examination teacher, such as position, school, research direction, etc., as well as paper information, including paper title, DOI/PMID, publication time, publication journal, author category, academic violations, etc. The college’s statistical researchers are required to screen academic papers published within the verification period, identify academic papers with the above six conditions, put forward rectification suggestions, and form a self-examination work summary report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Specific inspection methods can be roughly divided into focused spot inspections and comprehensive inspections. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shihezi University and Yanshan University adopted a comprehensive inventory approach. A teacher from the Scientific Research Office of Shihezi University told Southern Weekend reporters that they had comprehensively checked 8,671 papers signed by teachers at the school within the time limit. The school organized an investigation team. The teachers first filled in the self-examination form, and then the college compiled and submitted it. Finally, the school&#39;s scientific research office reported it to the XPCC Education Bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person in charge of the Social Sciences Office of Yanshan University said that after the announcement, the secondary college organized teachers to conduct self-examinations and submit self-examination forms and commitment letters. The college issues a self-examination report based on the self-examination situation, which is finally summarized and reported by the Social Science Office. Southern Weekend reporters contacted some colleges of the school to inquire about the implementation status. Among them, a staff member from the office of the School of Construction Engineering and Mechanics confirmed the statement of the aforementioned person in charge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qinghai University and Southwest University of Science and Technology adopt focused spot checks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A teacher in charge of Qinghai University said that the school&#39;s Science and Technology Office takes the lead and adopts a two-level system. First, the college&#39;s professor committee organizes self-examination, and then the school inspection office conducts random inspections. Specific to different disciplines, the degree of rigor varies. For example, due to the subject characteristics of medicine, which is prone to academic misconduct, the school conducted a census of more than 150 papers published by teachers from the clinical medical school between January 2022 and May 2023, while other disciplines were Spot checks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the requirements in the notice are from January 2018 to May 2023, the aforementioned teacher in charge said that Qinghai University has two inspections every year, at mid-term and at the end of the year, so this time it will be from 2022 to the present. Check the thesis again as a key point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why he adopted the method of focused spot checks was that Qinghai University’s strong disciplines are mainly agriculture and forestry. “Due to the plateau specificity, many papers do not have experiments and data, and cannot be copied from other places. Therefore, The probability of academic misconduct will be relatively small.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Spot checks are conducted on a proportional basis. He gave an example, based on the total number of papers published by the college within the period, for example, 50 papers were published, and 10 papers were randomly checked, including the original data of the scientific research and whether the person named on the paper was a member of the research team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A teacher from the Science and Technology Development Department of Southwest University of Science and Technology said that they mainly screen key papers, and others mainly rely on feedback and reports from school teachers and other staff. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Almost no problems were found&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This kind of large-scale self-examination has little impact on This is the first time for many universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relevant officials from Southwest University of Science and Technology and Yanshan University stated that similar large-scale system self-examination work had not been carried out before. The person in charge of Southwest University of Science and Technology emphasized that issues such as academic misconduct and pseudonymity were previously mainly investigated and handled through reports from others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that in most notices, the self-examination time left for teachers is about one month. At present, the self-examination work has basically been completed at the school level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some self-examination window periods are shorter. The Science and Technology Office of Shijiazhuang Railway University issued a notice on July 26, 2023, requiring each college to complete the self-examination and cleanup work before July 30. If problems are found, a summary form should be filled out in a timely manner and submitted to the Science and Technology Office, and remedial measures such as corrections and retractions should be taken, and &quot;no feedback after the deadline will be deemed as a paper without academic misconduct.&quot; They gave each college only four days for self-examination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the feedback from the four schools interviewed, the result of the self-examination was “almost no problems.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teachers at Yanshan University said that the self-examination work was completed at the end of July and &quot;no problems were found&quot;, and emphasized that the relevant results have been reported to the Provincial Department of Education. Teachers from the Science and Technology Development Department of Southwest University of Science and Technology also said that the school has completed a preliminary screening and found no relevant violations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for whether a self-examination report needs to be issued, a staff member from the office of the School of Architectural Engineering and Mechanics of Yanshan University said, “The school only requires us to fill in a self-examination form and issue a report if there are any problems, but our school should no problem&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similarly, the teacher in charge of Qinghai University said that since inspections were organized twice a year before, no serious academic misconduct was found this time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The only exception is Shihezi University. They self-identified three illegal articles. The violations were improper naming, purchasing data, and repeated publication. They belonged to the School of Physical Education, School of Medicine, and School of Animal Science and Technology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, the improper listing and purchase data are illegal articles that have been investigated before this inspection. Although notices from the science and technology departments of many provinces stated that papers that have been investigated and dealt with may not be included in the scope of this self-examination. However, the teacher in charge of the Scientific Research Office of Shihezi University believes that it &quot;still serves as a warning.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to punish after investigation? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The General Office of the Ministry of Science and Technology stated that if problems are found during self-examination and cleanup, scientific researchers must report them to their units in a timely manner and take remedial measures such as corrections and retractions. Those who comply with the lenient treatment circumstances specified in Article 34 of the &quot;Rules for the Investigation and Handling of Untrustworthy Conduct in Scientific Research&quot; may be given lenient treatment in accordance with the regulations; those who conceal or make false reports shall be punished in accordance with Article 3 of the &quot;Rules for the Investigation and Handling of Untrustworthy Conduct in Scientific Research&quot; Article 15 and other relevant regulations will be dealt with seriously and publicly announced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teachers from the Scientific Research Office of Shihezi University explained that the school has criticized and educated the teachers involved and required them not to apply for projects within three years. They are not allowed to be prioritized and receive talent titles, nor can they apply for science and technology projects. award. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shihezi University will take lenient treatment for those who took the initiative to report in this self-examination. Zhang Xiaoqian and Li Jie of the School of Animal Science and Technology published the article &quot;The Effect of Culture Temperature on the Test Results of Streptococcus Thermophilus Inhibition Method&quot; in 2019. The teacher involved submitted papers to two journals, &quot;Heilongjiang Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine&quot; and &quot;Chinese Dairy Cow&quot;, of which &quot;Heilongjiang Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine&quot; was the core journal. In May 2019, &quot;Chinese Cows&quot; took the lead in publishing the paper, and four months later, &quot;Heilongjiang Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine&quot; published this article. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After discovering the duplicate publication, the author of the paper repeatedly negotiated with the person in charge of the journal &quot;Chinese Cows&quot; and asked the other party to withdraw the paper, but was rejected. It was not until July 2023 that the author of the paper negotiated with the relevant notice from the Ministry of Science and Technology, and the other party finally agreed to withdraw the paper. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A teacher from the Scientific Research Office of Shihezi University said that because the author of the paper took the initiative to report it and contacted the magazine several times to withdraw the paper, the handling was lenient and only criticized and educated. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Why self-examination? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Why is there this large-scale top-down self-examination? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The explanation in the aforementioned Ministry of Science and Technology notice is to consolidate the main responsibilities of each unit, reduce the stock of academic misconduct papers, strive to curb the increase, and guide scientific researchers to strengthen their awareness of scientific research integrity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, the core of self-examination is to eliminate the stock and curb the increase. The aforementioned person close to the Ministry of Science and Technology explained that for example, a scientific researcher bought an article ten years ago and either published it to apply for a professional title to make a profit, or it has never been used. If it doesn&#39;t work, I can only hold it in with all kinds of severe crackdowns now. Once it is published, it may explode one day. Either way, they will be uneasy. Self-examination and clean-up is a good opportunity, &quot;It is to give these scientific researchers who have made mistakes a chance, whether they were ignorant or lucky at the time.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, it also gives scientific researchers an opportunity to self-examine and sort out. &quot;It is always a good thing to sort it out, to enhance the awareness of integrity, to find out the family background, and to avoid the situation of being named but not knowing it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for curbing the increase, &quot;If you know that everyone is watching this matter , they will never do it again.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the aforementioned person close to the Ministry of Science and Technology mentioned that since it is a self-examination, there are mitigating circumstances. &quot;If there is no profit from it, you may not even be held accountable, but criticism is definitely required.&quot; He believes that self-examination serves more of an educational and deterrent role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, this is not the first time an inventory has been carried out. Southern Weekend reporters learned that this work was also carried out at the ministry level in 2022, with the purpose of letting relevant departments and local levels understand the importance that ministries attach to scientific research integrity work, but it was &quot;not made public&quot; at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the possible concealment of reports, the aforementioned people close to the Ministry of Science and Technology said that if there are no problems during the self-examination, but problems are found in the future, and they are within the time period from 2018 to the present, then the punishment will definitely be aggravated. , &quot;This is equivalent to confronting integrity checks.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you look at it over a longer period of time, behind the self-examination are the increasing number of retractions of papers and the tightening of scientific research integrity management measures in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 20, 2017, academic publishing giant Springer issued a statement stating that 107 papers published in &quot;Tumor Biology&quot; had been withdrawn due to suspected peer review fraud. The papers involved are all from China and were published between 2012 and 2016. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The China Association for Science and Technology expressed its opinion at the time, hoping that Springer Publishing Group could improve the internal control mechanism as soon as possible, strengthen the management of journals, and deal with problematic papers before publication instead of withdrawing them after publication. At the same time, we are highly vigilant about &quot;predatory journals&quot; that seek financial gain and collude with &quot;third-party&quot; institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On January 15, 2023, Healsan Consulting LLC of the United States released the &quot;2022 SCI Paper Retraction Briefing&quot;. The briefing shows that as of December 31, 2022, a total of 41,642 SCI manuscripts have been withdrawn worldwide, including 19,421 from China. Specifically, from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022, there were 5,488 SCI manuscripts retracted around the world, of which 2,879 were retracted in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is also an increasing emphasis on scientific research integrity. In May 2018, the General Office of the CPC Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council issued &quot;Several Opinions on Further Strengthening the Construction of Scientific Research Integrity.&quot; The opinions emphasize the need to severely crack down on behavior that seriously violates the requirements of scientific research integrity, establish a lifelong accountability system, and investigate and deal with it at any time once discovered. This is the first time that the central government has issued a document raising the importance of scientific research integrity to a very high level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, in 2020, the Science and Technology Progress Law was revised to further clarify the relevant punitive measures for breach of trust in scientific research. In 2022, 22 departments including the Ministry of Science and Technology revised the &quot;Rules for Investigation and Handling of Scientific Research Integrity Cases (Trial)&quot;, which resulted in more specific handling rules for the investigation and handling of scientific research dishonesty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, starting from 2018, the Ministry of Science and Technology has successively announced the results of investigations and treatment of untrustworthy conduct in scientific research every year. There are one batch of results from 2017 to 2019, two batches in 2020, and two batches in 2021 and 2022. Four batches were announced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There will be follow-up after this round of self-examination. The aforementioned people close to the Ministry of Science and Technology said that, in particular, problems that have not been found at all are precisely within the scope of focus. &quot;This time I came with the red seal of my unit, and there was not a single problematic article. However, if the articles are frequently withdrawn later, or problems arise during the investigation, then the unit&#39;s main responsibility will definitely not be fully implemented, and it will be seriously investigated and dealt with.&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[医生频频被举报，“飞刀”为何难合规？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257002]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/19/nJ5K8okIndVjOpZzD0Ym5yrulOaiEvsPsrAMQWtq.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height=&quot;847&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/nJ5K8okIndVjOpZzD0Ym5yrulOaiEvsP srAMQWtq. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251240&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Currently, consultation and multi-point practice are two ways to formalize &quot;flying knife&quot; The main path, but the remuneration standards of both should be consistent with the remuneration system in the main practice institutions. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the disease is not cured, should the surgery fee be refunded? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of August 2023, Mr. Ma, a family member of a patient in Qixian County, Henan Province, said that his father &quot;had a bump on his face&quot; in July, so he came to Qixian Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital for treatment. The hospital informed me that a specialist from Kaifeng would perform the surgery and that a cash payment of 3,000 yuan would be required. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The surgery was performed by experts from outside hospitals, the surgical fee was higher than the market price, and the cash payment was all reminders that Mr. Ma&#39;s father had undergone a &quot;flying knife&quot; surgery. &quot;Flying Knife&quot;, as the name suggests, &quot;hits the flying knife to open the knife&quot;. Doctors leave their hospitals to visit other places in their spare time, mostly performing surgical operations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What’s interesting is that the patient’s condition was not good, and Mr. Ma wanted to repay the 3,000 yuan surgical fee charged by the surgeon. This was based on the “Interim Regulations on the Management of Physicians’ Out-of-Home Consultation” issued by the former Ministry of Health in 2005. Regulations regarding consultation fees should be paid uniformly to the consulting medical institution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident was reported by Henan Metropolis Channel, it immediately attracted attention in the industry: Should &quot;flying knife&quot; surgery exist? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some doctors believe that &quot;flying knife&quot; surgery currently lacks institutional protection, brings risks to both patients and doctors, and should be banned. Some doctors also hold objections, believing that &quot;flying knife&quot; surgery helps experts earn income, patients receive convenient treatment, grassroots hospitals gain technical experience, and local medical insurance funds can stay local, so it should be supported. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To this day, &quot;throwing knife&quot; surgery remains in a legal gray area. Policies that can make &quot;flying knives&quot; comply have encountered many obstacles in the hospital&#39;s internal management and institutional processes. Under the huge market demand at the grassroots level, private &quot;flying knives&quot; have always existed. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Income issue&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;For doctors, the core reason for the long-lasting success of &quot;Flying Knife&quot; is &quot;increased income.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, consultation and multi-site practice are the two main ways to formalize &quot;flying knife&quot;, but the remuneration standards for both must be consistent with the salary system within the major practice institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 2005 &quot;Interim Provisions on the Management of Physicians&#39; Out-of-Home Consultation&quot; mentioned that the consultation fees involved in the consultation shall be subject to the regulations of the location of the inviting medical institution, and additional fees may be charged as appropriate on the basis of local regulations. The increase will be determined by the provincial price department in conjunction with the health administrative department at the same level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The range of &quot;discretionary&quot; is destined not to be too high. Cheng Sheng, the department director of a secondary hospital in Beijing, told Southern Weekend reporters that the cost of inter-hospital consultations in Beijing is about 300 to 300 yuan. 500 yuan, &quot;Which expert is willing to waste time and energy by making such a trip?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the salary of multi-site practice, the former National Health and Family Planning Commission issued the &quot;Regulations on Promoting and Standardizing the Multi-site Practice of Physicians&quot; in 2014. &quot;Notice of Several Opinions&quot; stipulates that the salary of multi-site practicing physicians is determined by consultation between the medical institution and the physician at the place of practice based on factors such as actual working hours, workload, and work performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the income that doctors who perform daily surgeries in our hospital can earn, a respiratory doctor in Shanghai once revealed to a Southern Weekend reporter that his remuneration for each operation is about 300 yuan. A hard-working doctor Two or three operations are performed every day, and the monthly performance bonus income is about 30,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Corresponding to this is the income from &quot;flying knives&quot;. Wang Gui, who works as a &quot;flying knife&quot; agency, revealed to Southern Weekend reporters that the cost of a &quot;flying knife&quot; surgery for a patient ranges from 3,000 yuan to 9,000 yuan, with the agency taking a 10% commission and the rest going to the doctor. The main factors that determine the cost are the doctor&#39;s level, the difficulty of the operation, and the distance of practice. An operation priced at 10,000 yuan may require the support of multiple doctors across provinces, and the operation lasts 7 to 8 hours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Agents tend to stratify experts. Top experts are generally subject leaders, master&#39;s and doctoral tutors, and department directors of top hospitals in their cities. These doctors are the first choice for foreign aid in large hospitals in provincial capital cities. The seniority and popularity of ordinary experts are low, and the general location of &quot;flying knife&quot; is county-level hospitals. “There are quite a lot of surgeons in general surgery, ophthalmology, gastroenterology, hepatobiliary surgery, thoracic surgery, and orthopedics,” Wang Gui said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Without an intermediary like Wang Gui, &quot;throwing knives&quot; mostly occur between doctors who have personal relationships. Most of the inviting doctors come from district and county hospitals, or have studied in the expert&#39;s department, or have studied under the same discipline. &quot;Both parties must know the basics.&quot; said Cheng Lei, director of thoracic surgery at a tertiary hospital in Beijing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, regardless of the form, compared with the above-mentioned &quot;Regulations&quot; and &quot;Notice&quot;, &quot;flying knife&quot; surgery is expensive. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Formalization efforts have never stopped&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of some doctors, in addition to economic benefits, &quot;Flying Knife&quot; can also showcase their skills and improve &quot; Jianghu status&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cheng Lei told Southern Weekend reporters that he once went to overseas hospitals to demonstrate technology under the organization of a surgical instrument manufacturer, helping a tumor ablation surgery to be implemented nationwide. “It’s more like a flying knife than a flying knife. It’s about teaching.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even as the chief physician of thoracic surgery, Cheng Lei has to ask for help from colleagues who can handle difficult surgeries. Cheng Lei&#39;s father was diagnosed with aortic dissection in a hospital in Jiangsu and suspected aortic aneurysm. The local hospital did not have the conditions for surgery, and it was hundreds of kilometers away from Shanghai for treatment. Once the tumor ruptured on the way, it would be life-threatening. Finally, Doctor &quot;Flying Knife&quot; solved the urgent problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, given the reality of uneven distribution of medical resources, governments at all levels have never stopped trying to bring &quot;flying knives&quot; onto the formal track. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 2005 &quot;Interim Regulations on the Management of Physicians&#39; Out-of-Home Consultation&quot; proposed an inter-hospital consultation system, and the 2009 &quot;Notice of the Ministry of Health on Issues Concerning the Multi-site Practice of Physicians&quot; responded to the concerns from all walks of life about allowing multiple sites. The call to practice. Since 2020, the construction of medical consortia has accelerated, and the consultation, training, and referral systems of hospitals within the same medical consortium have become increasingly mature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It can be understood that if an expert wants to perform surgery in the same hospital for a long time, he will usually apply for a multi-site practice registration. If it is a one-time operation, a consultation method will be used.” Senior Jingheng Law Firm Partner Zhang Li, who has been a doctor for six years, explained this to a Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of the multi-site practice system, there was a restrictive rule that &quot;a doctor is not allowed to practice in more than three medical institutions.&quot; However, the &quot;Physician Practice Registration Management Measures&quot; promulgated in 2017 allowed doctors to Practice in multiple locations across provinces. It also stipulates that doctors who practice in multiple locations within the same provincial administrative region of their main practice institution only need to register with these practice institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The change from a registration system to a filing system means that doctors can practice at multiple locations without permission from the main practice institution and the local health department. With the support of such policies, a set of data released by the National Health Commission in October 2020 showed that the number of multi-site practicing doctors in the country has reached 260,000, four times that of 2016. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“Hospitals don’t want to see their doctors flying around”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Currently, there are still many obstacles to the promotion of multi-site practice, which also provides “ Throwing knives&quot; creates the soil of reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many interviewees mentioned soft discipline in hospitals. The Southern Weekend reporter obtained the &quot;Multi-site Practice Management Standards for Physicians&quot; implemented by a well-known hospital in Southwest China, which requires doctors to complete the multi-site practice registration, but also to register with the local health bureau and submit it to the hospital. Photo, physician qualification certificate, practicing physician license. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The cumbersome in-hospital approval process is not an isolated case. According to public reports from the self-media &quot;Seeing Medical Circle&quot;, in 2020, the &quot;Measures for the Management of Multi-site Practice of Physicians (Trial)&quot; issued by Changsha First Hospital stipulates that doctors who practice multi-site must have intermediate professional titles or above, and their departments must be above. The department&#39;s year-end KPI assessment results for the first year rank above the average level, etc. The document also states that non-commandatory activities in medical institutions outside the hospital must be approved by the department director, reported to the medical department and the leader of the hospital in charge, and can only be registered after approval by the hospital office meeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Multiple Practice Management Standards for Physicians&quot; of the above-mentioned Southwest Regional Hospital requires that multi-site practicing physicians should sign a labor agreement with the multi-site practice institution on the practice category, scope of practice, employment period, work tasks, Medical responsibilities, time arrangements, assessment methods, salary, insurance benefits, etc. are clarified, and the agreement is filed with the Medical Department of our hospital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pang Liang, a surgeon at a private hospital in Beijing, told Southern Weekend reporters that some hospitals have banned doctors from practicing outside their homes. One of the reasons is that they are worried that patients will be diverted to other hospitals, which will affect their income. Xie Rushi, honorary president of the Shenzhen Non-Public Medical Institutions Association, analyzed from a purely managerial psychological perspective, &quot;Hospitals don&#39;t want to see their doctors flying around. This is normal.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot; &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Flying knives&quot; &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Controversies continue, &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&quot;The people will not hold the officials accountable&quot;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Flying knife&quot; surgeries performed without permission may be classified as illegal medical practice and subject to severe punishment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the technical appraisal of medical malpractice determines that it constitutes a medical malpractice and bears the main responsibility, at the administrative level, the &quot;flying knife&quot; doctor may be suspended from practicing or even have his physician&#39;s practicing certificate revoked; if he violates criminal law, the doctor may also Prosecuted on suspicion of medical malpractice. If the medical malpractice is of equal liability and below, the &quot;flying knife&quot; doctor may be held administratively liable. As for the civil compensation part, the law stipulates that the subject of compensation is medical institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To a large extent, disputes related to &quot;throwing knives&quot; still belong to the category of &quot;people do not complain and officials do not investigate&quot;, and the patient&#39;s will has a great influence on the development of the case. In one case that Zhang Li represented, when a &quot;flying knife&quot; expert performed a chest nodule operation, the patient suffered from massive bleeding and &quot;could not get off the operating table.&quot; Afterwards, the doctor came to apologize. The family also believed that it is not easy for the country to train a doctor and chose to give up administrative complaints and criminal reports. Therefore, the &quot;flying knife&quot; doctor did not involve administrative or criminal penalties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in another case, the doctor performed a breast plastic surgery, and the patient also suffered from massive bleeding during the operation. After recovering, he reported it to the health authority of the hospital where the expert worked. In the end, the expert was administratively dismissed, transferred from his job, and fined to suspend his practice for three months. This is the &quot;throwing knife&quot; case with the most serious punishment that Zhang Li has ever come across. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if no medical accident occurs, doctors may be &quot;troubled&quot; by patients. A well-known example is that in 2019, a Shanxi patient asked doctors from Beijing Tiantan Hospital to perform neurosurgical stent implantation. According to China Youth Daily, the patient&#39;s family secretly videotaped and reported the incident while paying 10,000 yuan in cash for &quot;throwing a knife&quot;. As a result, the doctor involved and the doctor who helped collect and transfer the money to the hospital were suspended. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another concern is that &quot;flying knife&quot; doctors will leave after performing the surgery, leaving post-operative care to grassroots hospitals, but the latter may lack relevant knowledge, posing hidden dangers to patients&#39; well-being. Pang Liang mentioned a medical accident in 2019: a male patient underwent gastric volume reduction surgery in a hospital, which was performed by a foreign doctor who participated in academic exchanges. Five days after the operation, the patient died suddenly. The autopsy report showed that the patient suffered from secondary gastric leakage, acute purulent peritonitis, and peritoneal pus and blood effusion after surgery, leading to infection, toxic shock, and death from multiple organ failure. This may be the result of a lack of appropriate post-operative care in local hospitals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The patient feels that the effect is not as expected, and wants a refund. If you don&#39;t refund the money, I will sue you. I will sue you for sure.&quot; Cheng Lei said that the gray attribute of &quot;flying knife&quot; surgery is the natural instinct of doctors. The weak point is that high fees are not on the table. When encountering disputes, most grassroots hospitals that issue &quot;flying knife&quot; invitations will not go to the trouble of experts, but will quietly pay to &quot;settle the matter.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Legal and compliance problems need to be solved&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The seemingly beautiful &quot;flying knife&quot; has not yet come out of its non-compliant nature, which means that The ability of patients and doctors to resist risks is extremely fragile. For example, some hospitals will insure doctors with medical malpractice liability insurance to help reduce economic losses after an accident, but unregistered &quot;flying knife&quot; surgeries are obviously not covered by claims. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Doctors have also gradually figured out a &quot;semi-compliant&quot; out-of-hospital consultation operation path. Before visiting a doctor, ask the primary hospital to issue an invitation letter and complete the registration in your own hospital. After the consultation is completed, an additional amount of money will be charged on top of the normal income. The latter is not included in the financial process, nor is it paid directly by the patient to the specialist, but changes hands through the inviting hospital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This is what is done in daily life. There needs to be a certain amount of supplementary income so that people are willing to go for consultation.” Xie Rushi told Southern Weekend reporters that in this way, the behavior of “throwing knives” itself is legal. If it has been reported, it is a legal medical behavior, but part of the income is a red envelope, which is still shady and may face investigation and punishment by the disciplinary inspection department within the hospital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For self-protection, doctors will also screen &quot;flying knife&quot; cases to avoid participating in &quot;flying knife&quot; surgeries that are too risky. Wang Gui said that after a patient requests an expert from outside the hospital to perform the surgery, the doctor in charge of the hospital will evaluate whether the patient&#39;s family members are &quot;relatively sensitive&quot;, prone to finding faults, and whether the financial conditions are sufficient. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Pang Liang&#39;s vision, in order to let the &quot;flying knife&quot; income come into the light, large hospitals should establish a public expert database and clearly mark the price of each expert according to department and level for patients and Primary hospital selection. This price can put a gap between the salary of daily practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is more important is to let &quot;Flying Knife&quot; truly gain status. Wang Gui&#39;s institution has complete diagnostic and treatment business qualifications and controls private hospitals. Experts are registered in this hospital to practice in multiple locations, and are then dispatched by the hospital to provide consulting services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Zhang Li&#39;s view, this way doctors can bypass the public medical institutions in their main practice areas and legally conduct out-of-town consultations. In an article teaching doctors how to legally &quot;throw a knife&quot;, he called this practice &quot;long-range missiles&quot;, while &quot;intercontinental missiles&quot; are founding or joining a doctor group or clinic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The doctor group mainly connects the supply and demand sides of consultation and dispatches group doctors to primary hospitals to provide services. However, the doctor group does not belong to a medical institution. The doctor is still affiliated with a main medical practice institution-either the doctor&#39;s old employer or a private hospital within the doctor group. In essence, doctor groups are just intermediary platforms, and doctors still follow the path of multi-site practice or consultation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xie Rushi, who has participated in the establishment of several doctor groups, said that the doctor group can sign a notification agreement with the patient or the hospital where the patient is dispatched to determine the price of &quot;flying knife&quot; surgery, and charge in the name of the doctor group. This operation makes the &quot;flying knife&quot; fee in the gray area compliant. However, the problem faced by the doctor group is that it is very difficult to reach a cooperative relationship with the dispatched hospital through bidding, and it is impossible to form a business model by negotiating cooperation with patients one by one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even with complete qualifications, Wang Gui’s organization is still very cautious. Their declared business model is to provide doctors’ consulting services, including preoperative evaluation, postoperative rehabilitation plan formulation, etc., but does not include surgical performance. &quot;In fact, we can hold a knife, but we can&#39;t say so because there is no document allowing us to do so.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Interviewee Requirements, Cheng Lei, Wang Gui, and Pang Liang are pseudonyms in the article)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[新冠疫苗：每年秋天来一针？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256998]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 20:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/19/Tsc8wnKvCrJ8AxgwNj3kCNxQHmvTU6pdVq7qDbnD.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/Tsc8wnKvCrJ8AxgwNj3kCNxQHmvTU6 pdVq7qDbnD. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251239&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In some countries, the new coronavirus vaccine may be recommended every year like influenza. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 12, 2023, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a recommendation that everyone over six months old should get a shot of the new coronavirus vaccine this fall and winter. A few days ago, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved two new versions of the vaccine from Moderna and Pfizer. The new version of the vaccine targets a variant of the Omicron virus called XBB.1.5. , this strain is widespread in most countries around the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Vaccination remains the best way to prevent hospitalization and death from COVID-19. Vaccines can also reduce long-term COVID-19 effects. According to recommendations issued by the CDC, anyone who has not received a COVID-19 vaccine in the past two months can receive this new version of the vaccine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We have more tools to prevent the serious consequences of the new coronavirus.” said Mandy Cohen, MD, MPH, director of the US CDC. The reason for issuing this recommendation is that the new coronavirus is still mutating, new subtypes are emerging one after another, and the protective effect of the vaccine has declined sharply over time. Vaccination with the new version of the vaccine can better protect public health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The CDC&#39;s independent advisory committee voted 13:1 to recommend universal vaccination of this vaccine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the supporters, Dr. Sandra Fryhoffer, associate professor at Emory University School of Medicine in the United States, believes that severe COVID-19 may occur in people of all ages, including people without underlying diseases. , coupled with the fact that many people have not received booster shots before, this means that the overall immunity to the new coronavirus is declining, so vaccination should be recommended for all people. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Should ordinary people take the vaccine or not?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It has been more than three years since vaccination was encouraged, but the vaccine strategy is quietly changing. Most countries have not done so like the United States. Likewise, booster shots are recommended for everyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2023, the British government announced that the new version of the booster shot would be provided free of charge to seniors over 65 years old, frontline medical staff and vulnerable groups. France does not recommend booster shots for non-vulnerable groups. Germany has no plan for a booster shot in the autumn, although it has previously recommended that high-risk groups should receive a dose of the new crown vaccine every year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers generally believe that because the main role of the new coronavirus vaccine is to prevent severe illness rather than infection, high-risk groups will benefit the most from vaccination. There is still controversy in the scientific community as to whether low-risk groups and minors should be vaccinated again. “It makes a lot of sense to get booster shots for the elderly, people with underlying diseases and immune deficiencies,” said Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;In the past three years since the spread of the new coronavirus, many people have gradually become numb to the virus infection, and the number of people choosing to be vaccinated has also gradually declined. But in fact, whether in the United States or China, there are many people who are repeatedly infected with the new coronavirus. CDC scientists report that hospitalizations for COVID-19 have been increasing since mid-July, and while most of them are young children and older adults, half of children under five hospitalized do not have underlying health conditions, a reminder that Even otherwise healthy people may be at risk of severe illness from COVID-19. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the upcoming autumn and winter virus epidemic seasons, influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses and new coronaviruses are likely to be cross-infected, which will cause serious consequences for vulnerable groups. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Prepare before winter&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In our country, the overall epidemic situation is in a state of sporadic sporadic spread, but the new coronavirus has not disappeared. The phenomenon of transmission still exists, and there are many people around us who experienced &quot;two positives&quot; a few months ago and are now experiencing &quot;three positives&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Based on the fact that COVID-19 is extremely contagious, antibodies naturally attenuate after being infected with COVID-19, and there is no absolutely protective COVID-19 vaccine, most people will be infected 1-3 times a year.” The Third People of Shenzhen City Professor Lu Hongzhou, director of the hospital, explained, “It will not have a particularly big impact on people with normal immune function.” However, for people with low immune function such as the elderly, diabetes, and underlying cancer diseases, Lu Hongzhou recommends regular vaccination with the new crown vaccine every year. Vaccination strategies can include combined immunization with nasal spray vaccine and subcutaneous injection vaccine, and multivalent COVID-19 combination vaccine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 25, 2023, the &quot;Recent New Coronavirus Vaccination Work Plan for Key Populations&quot; issued by the Comprehensive Group of the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council proposed that targeted new coronavirus vaccination be implemented for key populations such as the elderly. It is clear that during the epidemic period of the XBB variant strain of the new coronavirus, focusing on the autumn and winter of this year, vaccination containing the antigen components of the XBB variant strain is recommended as a priority. Experts call on people who have been infected and have not completed basic immunity to receive one dose of vaccine 3 months after infection. This will help provide better protection for people at high risk of severe illness and death in possible subsequent epidemics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some experts predict that the number of new coronavirus infections will increase after the start of school in September. According to the immunity cycle, the next wave of the new crown epidemic may appear around November this autumn. At this time, it is also the flu season. The superimposition of COVID-19 and influenza may lead to an increase in severe respiratory infections. Therefore, it is recommended to receive both influenza vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine at the same time. This is also recommended by the WHO - superposition of the two vaccines can maximize the prevention of severe illness. and mitigate the risk of viral cross-infection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The increase in hospitalizations and deaths shows that coronavirus disease is here to stay and the world still needs tools to prevent, detect and treat COVID-19.” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO, in September 2023 Emphasized at the media briefing on the 6th. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 20:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[天降烟头烫伤女婴，DNA比对锁定嫌疑人：胜于住户连坐多矣！丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256968]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Some time ago, a baby girl in Zhengzhou was burned by a cigarette butt falling from the sky in a community. The police collected blood from all the residents upstairs and compared the DNA on the cigarette butts, and successfully identified the suspect who threw the cigarette butts. This is another case of using high-tech means to identify the suspect of throwing objects from high altitude. It also reminds you again that throwing objects from high altitude is extremely harmful and the probability of police intervention to solve the case is greatly increased. Don’t take chances and try the law yourself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to The Paper, at the end of August, Ms. Huang was taking her 4-month-old baby for a walk downstairs when an unextinguished cigarette butt fell from the sky and burned the child&#39;s shoulders and neck. Although the surveillance cameras in the community only cover one floor and there is no high-altitude surveillance, it is impossible to find out who threw the cigarette butts through the video. However, the police successfully found the suspect who threw the object at high altitude by collecting blood from all the residents upstairs to test DNA. Not only will this person be liable for civil torts, but he is also likely to be subject to criminal penalties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The tall buildings provide us with more living and working space and have become a symbol of modernization. However, they also bring the risk of throwing and falling objects from high altitudes. Carrying high-speed kinetic energy converted from high-altitude potential energy, even an egg weighing tens of grams may cause serious injury, not to mention other dangerous items. In recent years, there have been constant news about vehicles being damaged by objects thrown and falling from heights, killing and injuring people. In 2016, an iron fitness ball fell from the sky in Suining, Sichuan, killing a baby girl under one year old; in 2020, another 14-month-old baby in Shaoxing, Zhejiang was hit in the head by a brick thrown from upstairs. Causing brain death...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although it is unlikely that an unextinguished cigarette butt will injure someone, the risk of causing a fire or scalding someone is not small. In addition to the recent case in Zhengzhou, a similar case occurred in a community in Luzhou, Sichuan in 2021. A cigarette butt dropped from a high altitude burned through the roof of a baby car and almost burned the baby. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, casualties or property losses caused by falling objects from high altitudes were usually dealt with as civil infringements, and the victims had to collect evidence on their own to prosecute. Unless the impact was extremely serious, the police generally would not intervene in the investigation. The individual&#39;s ability to collect evidence is naturally very weak, and in most cases the perpetrator cannot be found. What to do? The previous law stipulates that in this case, all &quot;possible perpetrators&quot; will be compensated. That is to say, once an incident involving a high-altitude object injuring someone occurs and the perpetrator cannot be found, all residents upstairs (except those who have evidence to prove their Those who are not the perpetrators (for example, if the building is vacant and no one lives in it, etc.) will be &quot;sitting together.&quot; Although this provision allows the victim to receive compensation, it is very unfair to those who did not throw things downstairs. It may even condone the perpetrators, because the consequences of the evil are shared by many people. This legal provision and related court decisions have caused great controversy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key to solving the problem is to find the perpetrators and punish them severely. This aspect relies on technological progress, such as high-altitude video surveillance, DNA comparison and other technologies, which can help identify the perpetrators. On the other hand, there are changes in legal provisions. If you still let the victim collect evidence on his own, it will basically be impossible. Because individuals do not have the right to collect DNA from others for identification, there are no legal provisions, and properties have no incentive to install high-altitude surveillance systems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Civil Code and Criminal Law Amendment (11), which will be implemented in 2021, has changed this rule. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the civil side, although the &quot;simultaneous sitting&quot; provisions still exist, the Civil Code requires the police to investigate in a timely manner in accordance with the law and identify the person responsible. The &quot;continuous sitting&quot; rule applies only when the police are unable to find out. As a result, it has become the legal duty of the police to identify the person responsible for falling objects from heights. The police have greater power and ability to conduct investigations. For example, they can narrow the scope of investigation based on the mobile phone signal at the location of the incident, and can force &quot;possible perpetrators&quot; to provide biological samples for DNA comparison. Through these technical means, the police can basically make the perpetrators invisible. Especially the DNA comparison is extremely shocking. In the case of a cigarette butt falling from the sky in Luzhou, Sichuan, which almost scalded a baby, the perpetrator voluntarily surrendered after the police completed the DNA analysis on the cigarette butt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the Civil Code also stipulates that property management companies and other building managers should take necessary safety measures to prevent infringement incidents of falling objects from high altitudes; otherwise, they will bear tort liability for failing to perform safety guarantee obligations. In this way, the property management company will have the motivation to do a good job in prevention, monitoring and other tasks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of criminal liability, the judicial interpretation issued by the Supreme People&#39;s Court in 2019 stipulates that intentional throwing of objects from high altitude and negligent falling of objects from high altitude can be classified as &quot;crime of endangering public safety by dangerous means&quot; and &quot;negligence causing casualties.&quot; Convicted and punished for crimes such as &quot;serious accident crime&quot; and &quot;major liability accident crime&quot;. The Criminal Law Amendment (11), which took effect on March 1, 2021, has added the crime of &quot;throwing objects from high altitudes&quot;. Although the penalty for this crime is lighter than the penalty for &quot;crime of endangering public safety&quot;, the police must open a case to investigate the crime regardless of the severity. This also means that under the new criminal law, the threshold for criminal offenses for throwing objects from high altitudes has been lowered, and the police have greater legal responsibilities to conduct criminal investigations. In this way, the probability of the perpetrator being discovered will be greatly increased, the possibility and intensity of punishment will also be greatly increased, and the deterrence of high-altitude missiles will also be greatly increased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Use technology to let the law grow teeth and form sufficient deterrence. Those who throw objects from high altitudes will be caught and severely punished. Those who throw objects from high altitudes will have nowhere to hide. With fewer people daring to test the law, the sky above our heads will be safer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[坚守大山十年，月薪不到三千：支教老师“中年危机”何解]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256942]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国铁集团：不可能给第三方平台“优先购票权”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256988]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 18:31:42&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Today, the railway department began to sell train tickets for October 3, with sufficient tickets left in all directions. From September 28th to October 2nd, there are still votes left. For tickets sold during the pre-sale period on and before September 27, there are sufficient remaining tickets in all directions. Based on passenger flow demand, tickets for the more than 100 additional passenger trains that the railway department will open during the holidays have been on sale since September 18, which can increase the passenger capacity by more than 70,000 seats per day. From September 13 to 18, the railway department sold a total of 111 million train tickets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on passenger travel demand, the railway department has arranged to open more than 100 additional passenger trains during the National Day holiday. These trains will run on September 28, and tickets will go on sale on September 18. The main directions for adding trains are: Nanchang to Guangzhou, Wuhan to Guangzhou, Changsha to Nanchang, Nanchang to Shanghai, Xiamen to Shanghai, Shenzhen to Changsha, etc. Based on train ticket pre-sales, waitlist ticket purchase data and railway transportation capacity, the railway department will also open additional passenger trains in popular directions and hot time periods in a timely manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Passenger travel is highly concentrated during the holidays, and train tickets in some popular directions and hot periods are in short supply. Passengers can choose to buy tickets by waitlisting, transfer, etc., or according to the remaining tickets at different times and directions. , choose to travel during off-peak hours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, EMU train fares have implemented a differentiated floating pricing mechanism, which is mainly based on market supply and demand and passenger flow patterns, with the published fare as the maximum price, and is implemented in time periods, seats, and sections. A multi-tier, high and low ticket price floating strategy. During this year&#39;s National Day holiday, high-speed rail still implements differentiated fares. For example, the fare for EMU trains between Beijing and Shanghai is as high as 667 yuan and as low as 404 yuan for second-class seats.

Opinions on Production Work&quot; press conference. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Du Hansan/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Local regulatory and supervisory departments and national supervisory agencies have connected all normal production and construction coal mines to the Internet. Sensory data such as safety monitoring, personnel positioning, and video surveillance can monitor more than 600,000 sensors, more than 800,000 well workers, and 39,000 household operating video surveillance data across the country in real time, and develop a variety of risk analysis and early warning functions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of September 18, 2023, the State Council Information Office held a press conference on the &quot;Opinions on Further Strengthening Mine Safety Production Work&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Opinions&quot;). Deputy Director of the National Mine Safety Supervision Bureau Zhang Xin said that the opinions &quot;strive to fundamentally eliminate hidden dangers of accidents and fundamentally solve problems&quot; and further promote the transformation of the mine safety management model to pre-emptive prevention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Opinions&quot; is the first programmatic document in the field of mine safety production issued with the approval of the Party Central Committee and the State Council since the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China. It proposes a series of measures around &quot;preventive transformation&quot;, which is the first time at the national level. It is clearly required that the headquarters of mining-related central enterprises and large and medium-sized mining-related enterprises be equipped with safety directors, and it is required to standardize the management of outsourced projects in non-coal mines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Opinions&quot; require standardizing the management of outsourced projects in non-coal mines. The contracting unit dispatches project leaders, technical personnel and special operations personnel to the project department, and proposes to strive to establish the unit&#39;s own mining operations in production mines by the end of 2025. (Peel) the construction team or entrust an enterprise with corresponding conditions for overall management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Qingguo, director of the Safety Basics Department of the National Mine Safety Supervision Bureau, introduced that after the issuance of &quot;Several Provisions on Strengthening the Safety Management of Metal and Non-Metal Underground Mine Outsourcing Projects&quot; in 2021, a total of 1,360 inspection teams were organized across the country. More than 6,800 people were dispatched, which lasted 7 months, to inspect 3,895 outsourced engineering mines, resource integration coal mines and managed coal mines, and 134 major hidden dangers were discovered, during which 461 outsourcing teams were dismissed or transferred to others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Qingguo pointed out that through special rectification, the management of outsourced projects in non-coal mines has been further standardized and the management level has been greatly improved. “However, there are still inconsistent management of personnel teams, illegal contracting and subcontracting, and suspended safety responsibilities. , issues such as insufficient investment in safety.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Opinions&quot; further requires the management of outsourced projects in non-coal mines, clarifies the safety responsibilities of non-coal mines, and regulates the number of contracting units for metal and non-metal underground mines, the staffing and academic qualifications of contracting units, and blasting operations. As well as establishing its own mining team, clear requirements have been put forward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Without control of disasters, there will be no peace for mines. The management of major disasters is always the top priority in promoting advance prevention.&quot; Zhang Xin said that the next step will be to carry out regular and institutionalized surveys and management of hidden disaster factors in mines. To achieve the transformation from passive prevention to active management, from single treatment to comprehensive treatment, and from underground partial treatment to surface area treatment, &quot;anything that has not been identified, explored, and not treated in place shall be allowed to carry out mining operations, and we must not cooperate with it.&quot; Disasters &#39;fight with bayonets.&#39;&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Feng, director of the Non-Coal Mine Safety Supervision Department, said that in the future, not only will the investigation and rectification of major hidden dangers not be in place, the companies and responsible persons responsible for the accident will be held accountable, and the investigation and rectification will not be in place. Enterprises that cause major hidden dangers to still exist must also be held accountable, &quot;reflecting the concept of transforming the mine safety management model to pre-emptive prevention.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[小城千人围捕鳄鱼：已追回69条，仍有两条或在逃]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256981]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 17:31:29&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/19/598242ea15.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/598242ea15. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251197&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Crocodile capture scene.

A pickup truck drove up from the night and stopped in the middle of the nearby road. In the truck was a freshly caught crocodile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Gui, a 43-year-old crocodile catcher, pulled the crocodile by its tail and dragged it out of the pickup truck with his team members. They were about to transfer the crocodile to the van, where three crocodiles were already tied up. The crocodile was dragged to the back of the truck, its limbs were tied to its sides, and its long mouth was tied with tape so that it could not open or close. Qiu Gui and three other team members wearing headlamps stood on both sides of the crocodile, holding its limbs and pushing upward together: &quot;One, two!&quot; The people standing in the carriage pulled the hemp rope around the crocodile&#39;s head and also Together they exerted upward force, and the crocodile successfully entered the &quot;cage&quot;. When untying the hemp rope, a crocodile in the carriage seemed to be very angry and threw its big head with its mouth tied tightly at the people on the side. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Affected by Typhoon Haikui, Maoming City, Guangdong Province suffered from heavy rains for days. On September 11, floods destroyed the fence of a crocodile farm in Luocun, the northern boundary, causing some crocodiles to escape. According to Nanfang+ news, there are a total of 71 crocodiles in the farm. As of September 16, a total of 69 crocodiles have been captured, and there have been no incidents of crocodile injuries. Currently, multiple search teams are still hunting the last two escaped crocodiles day and night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/3846f4d486.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/3846f4d486.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251198&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The farm where the crocodile escaped.

This is a crocodile species commonly found in breeding farms in Hainan, Guangdong and other places. According to relevant literature, there are no wild Siamese crocodiles in China, only breeding populations, which can be traded and operated with a license. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The company owned by the crocodile farm where the incident occurred is the Guangdong Yufeng Crocodile Breeding Professional Cooperative, which was established in March 2019. Its legal representative is Xu Jinwang. With tens of thousands of crocodiles being farmed and more than 20 years of breeding experience, Mao celebrity Xu Jinwang is known as the &quot;Crocodile King&quot;. Xu Jinwang&#39;s wife, Ke Yiming, told Southern Weekend reporters that after the crocodile escaped, they were under great pressure and suffered a huge loss, amounting to two to three million yuan. &quot;The crocodile is very valuable.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Wu Liming, an 81-year-old villager in Luo Village, Beijie, the fish pond used by Xu Jinwang to breed crocodiles was rented to him four or five years ago, totaling more than 30 acres, with an annual rent of 2,000 yuan. /acre, rented for 18 years. Wu Liming told Southern Weekend reporters that after the crocodile escaped and the flood level had not receded, he called Xu Jinwang every day out of fear: &quot;Let him take care of it, (the crocodile) is very dangerous.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;Ke Yiming explained that the flooding of the breeding farm was a natural disaster. &quot;We (the breeding farm) have done everything very safely. The floods there are so severe that we will not dare to raise them there in the future.&quot; On September 15, a Southern Weekend reporter saw at the scene , each crocodile pool is separated by a plastic baffle about 1.3 meters high. Regarding whether the use of plastic baffles can effectively ensure that the crocodiles do not escape, Qiu Gui, a professional crocodile catcher with more than 20 years of experience, explained to Southern Weekend reporters: &quot;This The baffle is OK. As long as the crocodile can&#39;t see outside, it will stay in the crocodile pond.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The news of the crocodile&#39;s escape frightened 75-year-old villager Wu Yanxin: &quot;I&#39;m scared. Why aren&#39;t you afraid?&quot; Wu Yanxin lives in Dapo Village, Zhensheng Town, about 400 meters away from the crocodile farm. Although he was scared, Wu Yanxin had a way to comfort himself: as long as he didn&#39;t go into the water or go to the shore, &quot;crocodiles don&#39;t walk that fast on the ground.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the crocodile escaped, Wu Yanxin often cycled and ran along the road around Pengcun Lake, taking 70 minutes to run an 8-kilometer lap. This is the largest body of water around the crocodile pond. Standing on the road around the lake, Wu Yanxin can see the crocodiles living in the pond. After the crocodile escaped, Wu Yanxin could no longer ride around the lake. The road was surrounded by a 1.5-meter-high wire fence to prevent the crocodile from hurting people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/333bc75667.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/333bc75667.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251199&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Huanhu Road is surrounded by barbed wire. Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Chen Jiahui &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The workers who installed the protective net were Zhou Hui and his colleagues who were born in the 1990s. On September 17, Zhou Hui told Southern Weekend reporters that after the crocodile escaped, they began to install protective nets along Huanhu Road. It took about three or four days to complete the installation, and then spent several days reinforcing it. One morning around 1 a.m., he and his colleagues were installing a protective net on the road to the crocodile pond. About 20 meters away, a crocodile surfaced and opened its mouth, then sank into the water; another weighed three to four hundred pounds. The crocodiles were lying on the shore 50 meters away. Zhou Hui took a light and found two yellow eyes staring at them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Yahong, the person in charge of supervision of the Crocodile Farm Residents Group, told Southern Weekend reporters that after the crocodile escaped, the village committee actively participated in catching the crocodile and arranged on-duty duty to ask the villagers not to go out and pay attention to safety. Wu Yahong said that when there were heavy rains in the past, he would remind the staff in the crocodile farm to pay attention to safety: &quot;The water has almost reached your crocodile pond, and the crocodiles have escaped. But this time the water is too big, and the crocodile pond has been soaked.&quot; ), the crocodile ran out.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A staff member of the adjacent Dapo Village Committee told Southern Weekend reporters that after the crocodile escaped, in order to ensure that there were no casualties, &quot;we launched There are more than 30 party members and volunteers, guarding various checkpoints 24 hours a day.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to capture the crocodile as soon as possible and ensure the safety of nearby residents, the 5-kilometer radius around the incident site is a key investigation area. A total of 51 outposts, 33 patrol teams, and nearly 1,000 staff were set up in the area to carry out arrests. On September 15, a militiaman on duty told Southern Weekend reporters that the day the crocodiles first escaped, the water level was still very high, and the farm was full of people. Everyone was busy pumping water and holding sandbags to block the water. &quot;If you are not afraid of the crocodiles appearing, then There are so many people, what are you afraid of, all the SWAT police are armed with guns.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/fb508a3153.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;626&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/fb508a3153.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251200&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In order to find crocodiles, the farm conducts water surveys.

The nearest gunshot to him was on the night of September 14, when a crocodile weighing two to three hundred pounds was found in a small drainage ditch near his family&#39;s paddy field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shooting a crocodile in the water is not easy. &quot;When you shoot it, it goes into the water. It&#39;s not like those on the ground, where it stays in place.&quot; A special police officer holding a sniper rifle said. A colleague on the side gave him an idea, &quot;Someone has to fill in the gun.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/187650e8d2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/187650e8d2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251201&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;SWAT searches for an escaped alligator. Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Zhao Ming &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with shooting crocodiles in the water, Qiu Gui believes that finding crocodiles is the most important and most time-consuming link. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to find the escaped crocodiles, the local area used sonar detection, drone inspections, and even tied ducks to the shore to lure the crocodiles to prey. A staff member of the sonar team told a reporter from Southern Weekend that the difficulty in detecting crocodiles with sonar is that it is difficult to detect crocodiles when they are swimming. The sound produced by drones usually scares timid crocodiles. The duck trapping effect is even weaker. The water area within which the crocodile escapes is large and there are many fish and shrimps. The crocodile has no shortage of food at all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Gui has his own methods after dealing with crocodiles for more than 20 years. In this arrest operation, including at the breeding farm, their team of six arrested a total of 56 animals, with the most on September 14, when 14 were captured. The remaining 13 were killed by special police and captured by crocodile catching teams from Zhanjiang, Yangjiang, Guangzhou and Foshan. Most of the crocodiles caught weighed more than 200 kilograms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Gui and his party usually go out at night, because crocodiles are more alert during the day and will quickly hide in the water after noticing any movement around them. At night, crocodiles often stay in one place and are relatively slow. You can catch them by moving slowly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike humans, crocodile eyes do not close from birth to death. Therefore, as long as you shine a flashlight at night, the yellow-glow eyes will reveal the location of the crocodile. At 2 a.m. on September 18, while searching for the last two crocodiles, Qiu Gui boarded the kayak again and searched for traces of crocodiles in Pengcun Lake. The night before, they found and captured three crocodiles here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Gui pointed the flashlight at the water and grass on the shore. He explained that the crocodile likes to come ashore at nine or ten o&#39;clock in the morning when the sun is getting warmer. Basking in the sun will make it easier for it to digest food in its stomach. A 200-pound crocodile can eat 10 pounds a day. After it is full, it will come ashore. If it is not frightened, it will stay until it has finished digesting and then go into the water to hunt. &quot;There is not much knowledge to find crocodiles, and there is no shortcut, just use a lamp to shine.&quot; Qiu Gui said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Crocodiles at night are easier to find and catch. After Qiu Gui and his party discovered the crocodile, they would carefully move the boat closer and stun the crocodile within one meter of the crocodile. &quot;After the stun, the crocodile&#39;s body seemed to be stiff.&quot; Taking advantage of the 10-15 minutes when the crocodile was unconscious, the capture team The crocodile man drags the crocodile onto the boat and binds its mouth and limbs as soon as possible. &quot;As long as you tie its mouth and don&#39;t let it open, the crocodile will be 100% controlled.&quot; Qiu Gui said that the most important thing is teamwork, and nothing can be done without tacit understanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A tied up crocodile is equally dangerous. After the crocodile wakes up, its head and tail can still attack. If it hits the leg, &quot;it will break the leg directly, no joke.&quot; Qiu Gui said that the crocodile has an attack range. &quot;We usually stand in the middle of it, which is equivalent to its blind spot. But we should also stay 1.5 meters away from it, which will be safer.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/eabb6219cc.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data- src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/eabb6219cc.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251202&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text -align: center;&quot;>;A crocodile was captured near a fence.

One of the focuses of the search that day was several fish ponds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fish pond is located in Helijing Village, only two to three hundred meters away from the crocodile farm. On September 15, the owner of a fish pond told Southern Weekend reporters that two crocodiles had been pulled into his fish pond. One was electrocuted and the other was shot. There may be crocodiles in the fish pond. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because the fish pond is three to four meters deep and there are many fish, methods such as electric shock, duck trapping and even shooting are ineffective. A staff member of the Maoming Emergency Management Bureau told a Southern Weekend reporter: &quot;The water is too deep to find the crocodiles. It would be best if they could be put into water about one meter deep.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Initially, the village Negotiations between the committee and fish pond owners on the compensation plan after the water was released did not go smoothly. Cai Fang, the wife of the above-mentioned pond owner, told Southern Weekend reporters that tens of thousands of fry were put into her fish pond, as well as some fish feed. &quot;The total cost is tens of thousands of yuan. Now we propose to pump half of the water and compensate for 2,000 yuan.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cai Fang does not agree with the compensation plan. She believes that if half of the water is drained, the remaining fish will He died of lack of oxygen and was worried that the crocodile would not be found hiding in the mud at the bottom of the pond. &quot;What if someone is bitten later, will I, the pond owner, be responsible?&quot; Cai Fang hoped that a thorough search could be carried out and the pond water could be drained. , make sure there are no crocodiles in the pond, and also handle the fish in the pond casually. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After several rounds of negotiations, on the evening of September 15, the two parties reached a compensation agreement at a price of 1,000 yuan per mu of water surface. Early the next morning, an excavator dug up the edge of the pond. After searching, no trace of the crocodile was found in the fish pond. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of September 16, a total of 69 crocodiles have been captured, but there are still two cases with no clues. After another two days of searching, this data has not changed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/9f921aceea.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/9f921aceea.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251203&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The capture team searched the lake at night.

They suspected that the two crocodiles May have died during breeding. &quot;Crocodiles are the most ferocious during the mating season. They will fight for the right to mate. If they fight too hard, some crocodiles will die.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early morning of September 19, the scope of the crocodile search The crocodile hunter&#39;s team began to search along the lower reaches of Pengcun Lake, one kilometer away from the crocodile farm.

Later, she received a notice mailed by the Xinle City Public Security Bureau, which stated that Bao Qinrui was placed under residential surveillance at a designated residence because he was &quot;suspected of picking quarrels and provoking trouble.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bao Linlin saw her husband again at the Xinle City Funeral Home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rescue records of Xinle City Hospital record that at 21:38 on July 19, 2022, the hospital received an emergency call, and Bao Qinrui was subsequently sent to the hospital. After more than three hours of continuous resuscitation, Bao Qinrui was still unconscious, without spontaneous breathing and heartbeat, and the hospital declared him dead. Xinle City 110 police officers signed at 1:38 a.m. the next day and contacted the Xinle City Funeral Home. The hospital recommended an autopsy to further clarify the cause of death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eight months after Bao Qinrui’s death, on the morning of March 30, 2023, the Shijiazhuang City Procuratorate arranged for an autopsy on Bao Qinrui’s body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bao Qinrui’s father Bao Jiye recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that on June 19, 2023, the Shijiazhuang Municipal Procuratorate presented him with an autopsy report, which concluded that “mechanical injury was excluded as a cause of death.” &quot;, it excludes death caused by poisoning, and does not rule out sinus node disease causing cardiac electrical activity disorder and cardiac arrest leading to death.&quot; Bao Jiye did not sign the report and applied for a second autopsy to be performed by an agency commissioned by the family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The investigation into the cause of Bao Qinrui’s death has stalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bao Jiye asked Cao Zhi, the prosecutor of the Shijiazhuang City Procuratorate who participated in the investigation. Cao Zhi replied that a second autopsy needs to be applied to the Xinle City Public Security Bureau. Xinle City Public Security Bureau staff replied to Bao Jiye that this application should be communicated to the Shijiazhuang City Procuratorate, &quot;The Public Security Bureau is also a party, and you don&#39;t believe it even if we do an autopsy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon of September 18, 2023, Cao Zhi said in an interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend that there is currently no investigation conclusion on Bao Qinrui’s death. As for whether a second autopsy can be performed, &quot;this is an internal investigation process and cannot be announced to the outside world.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Regulations on Handling the Death of Persons in Detention Centers&quot; jointly issued by the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, the Ministry of Public Security, and the Ministry of Civil Affairs stipulate that when institutions commissioned by the public security organs and procuratorates conduct autopsies, the opinions of the deceased&#39;s close relatives should be solicited. Close relatives who request to entrust another institution to conduct an autopsy should be allowed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, if a person dies during residential surveillance at a designated location, there are no clear regulations yet on whether family consent is required when an autopsy is commissioned. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Co-defendant&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Bailed&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Bao Linlin still doesn’t know about Bao Qinrui What specific behavior is suspected of provoking quarrels and provoking trouble? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the same day as Bao Qinrui, there were eight other people who were placed under residential surveillance at a designated location - Bao Qinrui&#39;s father Bao Jiye, brother Bao Shaorui, uncles Bao Jizhong and Bao Jitao, and his cousin. Diba Zhuorui and three other villagers from the same village were all suspected of provoking quarrels and causing trouble, and the execution location was also Xinle Hotel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than a month after Bao Qinrui passed away, on September 1, 2022, Bao Jiye and Bao Shaorui were released on bail pending trial. On September 28, the other six people, including Bao Jizhong and Bao Jitao, were released on bail pending trial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All eight people said they were beaten and given electric shocks while under residential surveillance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two days after Bao Qinrui’s death, on the afternoon of July 22, 2022, Bao Jitao, who was still under residential surveillance, was sent to Xinle City Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital for treatment due to fever. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Bao Jitao&#39;s hospitalization record, when he was admitted to the hospital, he had &quot;pain in both calves for 3-4 days, pain in the left chest and ribs for 1 day, skin damage and scabs on the left knee, and flakes on the right lower limb.&quot; Bruises and red rashes can be seen on both calves.” After experiencing chest pain, he was diagnosed with left rib fracture after examination. After being hospitalized for 7 days, Bao Jitao was discharged from the hospital on July 29. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 19, 2023, the Xinle City Public Security Bureau lifted the bail pending trial for eight people on the grounds that &quot;it was found that criminal liability should not be pursued.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The whistleblower expressed a &quot;reversal&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the notice of release on bail pending trial that Bao Jiye received, it was written that the case he was involved in was &quot;5• 25 project&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bao Jiye and Bao Shaorui recalled that during the residential surveillance period, the police asked them whether they had beaten Sun Huiqiang and others who came to ask for wages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bao Qinrui and other nine people involved in the case are all from Nantaying Village, Gaoyi County, Shijiazhuang City. Before the incident, Bao Qinrui worked in the Gaoyi County Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau. Bao Jiye runs a ceramic tile factory in Gaoyi, and Bao Shaorui, Bao Jitao, and Bao Zhuorui all work in the factory. Bao Jizhong is the party branch secretary of Nantaying Village. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Huiqiang is a contractor who participated in the construction of Bao Jiye’s ceramic tile factory in 2013 and 2014. He told Southern Weekend reporters that on May 22, 2022, at a worker’s home, police from the Yuhua District Public Security Bureau took notes on him and five other workers involved in the construction. At that time, he and the workers said that in the spring of 2014, they went to the ceramic tile factory to ask for wages and were beaten by Bao Jiye, Bao Jizhong and others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But on September 12, 2023, Sun Huiqiang said in an interview with a Southern Weekend reporter that he gave false testimony at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Sun Huiqiang&#39;s account, he and Bao Jiye did have a financial dispute at the beginning of 2022. There was a discrepancy of 200,000 yuan between the two parties regarding the amount of project funds, and they were in the negotiation stage at that time. Bao Moumou (pseudonym), a villager from the same village as Bao Jiye, contacted him and said that he had conflicts with Bao Jizhong, who served as the party branch secretary in the village. Bao promised that as long as Sun Hui did what he said, not only would the project money be returned, but the amount would even be higher than what he asked for. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After learning about Bao Qinrui’s incident, Sun Huiqiang and the workers made new records to the public security organs in September 2022 and June 2023, re-explaining the situation and showing that they had not been raped by Bao Jiye or Bao Jiye. Bao Ji Zhong and others beat him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2023, Bao Jiye noticed that reports against him for &quot;criminal involvement&quot; appeared on the short video platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of them is 66-year-old Zhang Shuke, who also had some disputes with Bao Jiye over the amount of project funds. On April 21, 2023, a user with the online name &quot;Dou E Yuan&quot; posted a video on the short video platform entitled &quot;Real people and true stories will never lie&quot;: Zhang Shuke held his ID card and told, &quot;Real-name reporting is very high. A triad gang in Yi County, headed by Bao Jiye and Bao Jizhong, maliciously owed me 600,000 yuan for a project through fraud. When I went to demand the account, I was beaten and insulted many times, and threatened to be beaten to death if I went back to the factory to demand the account. Buried alive”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bao Jiye sued Zhang Shuke for infringement of reputation rights. On June 7, 2023, the Gaoyi County Court conducted mediation on the case. The two parties reached an agreement: Zhang Shuke deleted the above video and recorded a video to apologize to Bao Jiye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this video can still be searched on the short video platform. Zhang Shuke explained to Southern Weekend reporters that what was said in the video was not true and that he was not beaten by Bao Jiye. The video was recorded at Bao&#39;s suggestion. At that time, Bao Moumou told him, &quot;If you talk about the seriousness of the matter, someone will take care of you. If you tell the truth, no one will take care of you.&quot; After the court mediation, he contacted Bao Moumou to delete the video, but Bao Moumou could not delete it either. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 18, 2023, a Southern Weekend reporter contacted Bao. The statement he provided was different from that of Sun Huiqiang and Zhang Shuke. He said that after Bao Jiye, Bao Jizhong and others were released on bail pending trial, they used &quot;coercion and inducement&quot; to bribe the informants and get them to retract their confessions. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;What is “residence”? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After his son passed away, Bao Jiye was confused as to why he was placed under residential surveillance at a designated residence by the Xinle City Public Security Bureau as he was from Gaoyi County, Shijiazhuang City. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Residential surveillance is one of the five coercive measures stipulated in the Criminal Procedure Law. Chen Yongsheng, a professor at Peking University Law School, explained that the coercive intensity of the five types of coercive measures is a ladder structure. From weak to strong, they are summons, bail pending trial, residential surveillance, detention and arrest. As a transitional measure, residential surveillance means that criminal suspects or defendants do not need to be completely detained like detention or arrest, but they are required not to leave their residence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For criminal suspects or defendants who meet the conditions for arrest, residential surveillance measures can be taken under three circumstances. One is due to their own factors, serious illness, pregnancy, etc.; the other is the special nature of the case or the handling of the case. necessary; third, the detention period has expired and the case has not been settled. In order to avoid extended detention, residential surveillance is implemented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Residential surveillance at a designated location is a special case of residential surveillance. The Criminal Procedure Law stipulates two types of circumstances under which residential surveillance can be carried out at a designated location: the criminal suspect or defendant has no fixed residence, or the case is suspected of crimes endangering national security or terrorist activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Interpretation of the Criminal Procedure Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; compiled by the Legal Affairs Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress explains &quot;residence&quot; as meaning that the criminal suspect or defendant lives in the city or county where the case-handling agency is located. Legal residence for work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The nine people involved in the case all have residences in Gaoyi County, and Bao Qinrui and Bao Shaorui also have properties in Yuhua District. Chen Yongsheng believes that as long as the parties concerned own real estate in Shijiazhuang City, according to legal provisions, they do not meet the requirements for designated residence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon of September 15, 2023, a deputy director of the Xinle City Public Security Bureau told Bao Jiye that the case was handled by the Yuhua Branch of the Shijiazhuang City Public Security Bureau, the Xinle City Public Security Bureau and the Gaoyi County Public Security Bureau. The three parties formed a task force to jointly handle the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But why did the Xinle City Public Security Bureau ultimately place Bao Qinrui and other nine people under residential surveillance in a designated location? On September 18, 2023, a Southern Weekend reporter contacted Guo Jie, director of the Xinle City Public Security Bureau, via text message. As of press time, no reply had been received. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[3D重现利比亚极端洪水，上万人身亡，大量高楼被夷为平地]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256966]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
