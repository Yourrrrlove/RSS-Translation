Due to the great success of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, Carrico and Weisman have won many major awards including the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, the Lasker Prize and so on. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine this time is truly well-deserved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/05/fAsK0dPttYF2W8soIvVJrdEUBDYF79H9JgXcOZRc.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;982&quot; height= &quot;736&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/05/fAsK0dPttYF2W8soIvVJrdEUBDYF79H9JgXcOZRc.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253045&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Drew Weissman and Katalin Karikó, the main pioneers of mRNA vaccines. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Cell website/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Pioneer&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Carico 1955 Born in Szolnok, Hungary, after receiving his PhD in Hungary, he moved to the United States in 1985 and entered into postdoctoral research at Temple University in Philadelphia and Bethesda University of Health Sciences, focusing on research on the medical application of mRNA. After experiencing a series of setbacks such as frustrated funding applications, demotions and salary cuts, and suffering from cancer, Carrico met her long-term research partner Professor Drew Weisman. The two met dramatically because of their fight for a copy machine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, Professor Weismann was already a moderately accomplished immunologist. Weisman, two years younger than Carrico, was born in Lexington, Massachusetts, USA. He received a doctorate in medicine from Boston University in 1987. When he met Carrico, Weissman had just established his own research group at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, working on research in areas such as AIDS vaccines. After learning about Carrico&#39;s research interests, Weisman suggested that Carrico switch to the field of mRNA vaccines and decided to collaborate with her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But mRNA vaccine research is not easy because mRNA is an extremely unstable small nucleotide molecule. The mRNA molecule is widely present in living organisms. It is the &quot;messenger&quot; for DNA to guide cell cooperation proteins. It is responsible for transmitting the genetic information of the gene to the ribosome, which &quot;installs according to the diagram&quot; and assembles the amino acid &quot;parts&quot; into various proteins. Therefore, mRNA is called messenger RNA. After completing its mission, the mRNA is quickly broken down by enzymes in the cell and its existence time is very short. If mRNA is injected into the body as a vaccine, these mRNA molecules will be broken down quickly before they can instruct cells to synthesize proteins. What&#39;s even more deadly is that animal experiments show that injecting unmodified mRNA into the body can trigger an immune response in the body, leading to serious adverse reactions to the vaccine. mRNA vaccines have also been ignored. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In response to these problems, Carrico and Weisman conducted a series of studies. Although funds were limited, they still persisted in this direction and made some major breakthroughs. In 2005, Carrico and Weisman discovered that some natural nucleotides in messenger RNA were important factors in causing adverse immune responses in the body. They found the nucleotides in messenger RNA that triggered adverse immune responses, and then used artificially synthesized Nucleotide replacement significantly weakened adverse immune responses. This study laid a key foundation for the subsequent development of mRNA vaccines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, Carrico, Weisman and others improved the messenger RNA vaccine to increase the stability of the mRNA vaccine in the body. For example, they used a liposome &quot;coat&quot; to coat the messenger RNA vaccine. Wrap it up so that it cannot be broken down by nucleases before entering the cell. With the continuous improvement of technology, there is increasing hope for the industrialization of mRNA vaccines. Compared with traditional vaccines, mRNA vaccines have some obvious advantages, such as good safety, short design and development cycle, low production cost, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;New Opportunities&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;However, before the outbreak of the new crown epidemic, mRNA vaccines had been tepid. At that time, dozens of mRNA-based vaccines were being developed around the world, and a few vaccines such as influenza vaccine, Zika virus vaccine, and rabies vaccine had entered clinical trials, but none had yet been approved for human disease prevention. This situation quickly changed due to the global pandemic of the new coronavirus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thanks to long-term accumulation, BioNTech, a German biotechnology company where Carrico serves as vice president and head of RNA therapy development, quickly launched new crown vaccine research and development after the outbreak of the new crown epidemic. The mRNA COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2, which targets the spike protein of COVID-19, was developed. Due to the emergency of the epidemic, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also given the green light to clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines such as mRNA vaccines, greatly shortening the pre-clinical animal testing and clinical trial time of COVID-19 vaccines, which originally took several years or even more than ten years. The clinical trial was completed in just 7 months. Fortunately, BNT162b2 not only shows good safety, but the effectiveness of the vaccine has also reached an astonishing over 90%, which is significantly better than traditional vaccines. Since the end of 2020, most countries and regions around the world, including the United Kingdom and the United States, have successively approved the emergency use of BNT162b2 vaccine. At the same time, the new coronavirus RNA vaccine mRNA-1273 developed by the American company Moderna also achieved similar results, and this vaccine is also based on the patented mRNA vaccine technology of Carrico and Weissman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In less than a year from vaccine design, clinical trials to approval for marketing, BNT162b2 and other mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have created a miracle in the history of vaccine research and development. This is of course related to the global pandemic of the new crown epidemic, but it is mainly due to the good safety and excellent effectiveness of the mRNA new crown vaccine. Judging from the real application data of subsequent large-scale immunization and the preventive effect against new coronavirus variants, mRNA new coronavirus vaccines such as BNT162b2 also performed well. According to the Nobel Prize website, more than 13 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered around the world, saving millions of lives. BNT162b2 and other mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are among the most outstanding vaccines. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Vaccine revolution? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;If the mRNA vaccine can only work in the new coronavirus epidemic, its charm will be greatly reduced. In fact, greatly encouraged by the success of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, dozens of clinical studies based on mRNA vaccines around the world are accelerating. If its application scope can be expanded, the mRNA vaccine technology pioneered by Carrico and Weismann is expected to start a vaccine revolution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are currently two main application directions for mRNA vaccines. The first major application direction is to prevent infectious diseases. In addition to COVID-19, the current mRNA vaccines against human infectious diseases caused by pathogens such as epidemic viruses, Zika virus, cytomegalovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus have also entered Phase II or III. Clinical Trials. According to a press release issued by Moderna on September 13, 2023, the company has submitted marketing authorization applications for the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) mRNA vaccine globally, and the seasonal influenza mRNA vaccine has been approved in three clinical trials. All trials also demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second main application direction is the treatment of cancer. According to the US clinical trial website, there are currently nearly 50 mRNA vaccines related to cancer treatment in the world that have entered or completed phase II clinical trials, including Bion. A number of mRNA vaccines for cancer treatment developed by companies such as Tektronix and Moderna have entered Phase II clinical trials. These vaccines mainly target cancers such as melanoma, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and head and neck squamous carcinoma. Among them, there are high hopes that mRNA vaccines can be used in combination with other anti-tumor drugs to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatment. According to the results of a phase II clinical trial jointly released by Moderna and the US pharmaceutical giant Merck at the end of 2022, an mRNA vaccine developed by Moderna performed well when used in combination with Merck&#39;s checkpoint inhibitor Keytruda. Good, over 1 year, the mRNA vaccine combined with Keytruda led to a more than 40% reduction in the risk of cancer recurrence or death in patients with stage 3/4 melanoma compared with Keytruda alone. Moderna and Merck plan to launch phase III clinical trials of this treatment in 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of now, apart from the multiple COVID-19 vaccines that have been approved for marketing, no mRNA vaccine has yet been approved for marketing. It remains to be seen whether the mRNA vaccine can show promising results in the prevention of other infectious diseases and cancer treatment. However, judging from the current progress of clinical trials, it is only a matter of time before a new mRNA vaccine is approved for marketing. The vaccine revolution initiated by mRNA technology may come soon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 13:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[兰州一高中两老师深夜围殴学生：“突击查寝”制值得反思丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258086]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a school violence incident has attracted attention. According to a report by China Morning Post, based on the statements of parents and dormitory administrator Ma, the timeline of the incident is as follows: At 11:40 pm on September 26, four persons, principal Wu and director of admissions office Hao, entered the They searched the dormitory and violently kicked in the door before entering. Suspecting the students to smoke, Wu and another teacher worked together to beat two students in the dormitory. The beating lasted for more than an hour, and the four did not leave until 1:20 a.m. the next day. During this period, Hao kept shouting, &quot;Beat him to death. If he is beaten to death, send him to the hospital.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident, a student suffered from syncope and nosebleeds. The dormitory manager, Ma, fed the child candy and stayed with him to comfort him for more than two hours. Afterwards, &quot;the school confiscated the phone and watch and asked the students to write a guarantee not to tell their parents.&quot; Three days later, both parents &quot;discovered&quot; that the child had symptoms such as facial bruising, lethargy, nightmares and convulsions, and this brought the matter into the public eye. The parents first contacted the dormitory manager, Teacher Ma. After hearing about this, Teacher Ma was &quot;filled with indignation and resigned.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the recorded conversation between Teacher Ma and the principal Wu, Wu apologized and admitted that &quot;the action was a bit too big and a bit extreme&quot; and &quot;has already apologized to the students and parents.&quot; Afterwards, Teacher Ma also told the media that students on the entire floor witnessed the atrocities that night and &quot;I have no intention of doing it anymore.&quot; After the media called the principal Wu, Wu simply said, &quot;We are dealing with this matter.&quot; At present, the Lanzhou Municipal Government has established an investigation team on this matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The timeline of this incident is not complicated, but there are still many questions that are worth analyzing one by one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the details of the incident are still quite ambiguous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the origin of the incident, the dormitory manager surnamed Ma said that he was &quot;inspecting the student dormitories on behalf of the school, but he did not expect to be so ruthless.&quot; It seems that the reason why the principal and his party entered the dormitory to check the dormitory and violently beat them was because they &quot;suspected the students of smoking.&quot; So, did the two students smoke? Why did the principal and his team violently kick in the door during the bed check? These are two key issues in this assault. There should be a logical chain between the student closing the door, the principal kicking the door and the student suspected of smoking to explain the cause of the incident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The facts presented in the current media reports and interviews with the parties can only be interpreted as &quot;the students did smoke and locked the door for fear of being punished. The principal failed to open the door and then violently kicked it in, and finally surrounded him.&quot; . Even if two students do smoke, the principal and others can only punish the students, not corporal punishment, which is prohibited by the Teachers Law and the Compulsory Education Law. If the two students were not smoking at all, the behavior of the principal and others would be tantamount to violent madness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 7, paragraph 3, of the &quot;Penalty Rules for Primary and Secondary School Education&quot; (Trial) stipulates that if &quot;smoking, drinking, or behaving inappropriately and violating the student code&quot;, the school and its teachers should stop it and provide criticism and education , education and punishment can be implemented if necessary. However, any kind of disciplinary action does not include the violent beatings in this incident, which is &quot;corporal punishment that directly causes physical pain by hitting, stabbing, etc.&quot; which is expressly prohibited in Article 12. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the accusations made by the boarding manager and parents are true, then the principal Wu and others are also suspected of illegal and criminal acts. Judging from the descriptions of &quot;facial bruises&quot; and &quot;nosebleeds,&quot; the two victims may have met the criteria for &quot;minor injuries.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, this incident also shows a major problem in the current teaching management of primary and secondary schools, that is, there is an almost absolute &quot;management and obedience&quot; relationship between schools and students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a power relationship between teachers and students, and the principal and director of the admissions office are higher &quot;superiors&quot; than teachers. They come out to &quot;check the bed&quot; to discipline students, and they are also unconsciously or consciously expanding this power, which includes the power to unconditionally discipline students with corporal punishment. At the same time, students must obey the principal and other superiors unconditionally, otherwise they will face an escalation of corporal punishment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the current law, once a violation of the student code such as &quot;student smoking&quot; occurs, on the one hand, the school can only punish and educate the students instead of corporally punishing and beating the students. On the other hand, the main responsible person they should hold accountable should be It is merchants who sell cigarettes to minors, parents or guardians who instigate or allow minors to smoke, rather than violently punishing minors who smoke. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, this incident also makes people rethink the management system of student dormitories and the so-called &quot;surprise dormitory inspection&quot; system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The original intention of the student dormitory management system is to improve dormitory management, protect student safety, and ensure learning and living conditions. However, schools at all levels are now using the banner of &quot;benefiting students&quot;, which naturally takes over the private space of students&#39; study and life. In this incident, the principal and his team came to check the dormitory room at 23:40 in the evening and violently kicked the door. From every angle, they were eroding or even violating the students&#39; private space. As adults, college students will naturally complain about regulations such as &quot;forced self-study&quot;, &quot;locking the computer&quot;, and &quot;checking the bed every night&quot;; and judging from this incident, even if the high school students are minors, such &quot;surprise bed checks&quot; are not allowed. It was too harsh, and the subsequent &quot;confiscation of phones and watches&quot; further demonstrated the willfulness of those in power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;High school students, mostly between the ages of 15 and 18, have the right to start taking over their own lives, manage their own personal space, and be responsible for their own actions. Whether high school boarding schools still need to treat older children like little ones is debatable, at least in terms of the dormitory management system. Schools should give students more private space to cultivate students&#39; self-management skills and better prepare them for adult life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, the problem exposed in this incident is not just a simple issue of school violence, but also reveals problems in the teaching management of primary and secondary schools. As quasi-adults, high school students cannot just be subordinates who accept management and punishment unconditionally, but are future masters who should be cared for and cared for in the adult world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[“文坛祖母”冰心 用爱温暖世纪丨那年今日]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257697]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[提升软环境，善待游客始]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258090]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 11:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The Mid-Autumn Festival and the National Day are on consecutive holidays, and travel is popular. Experts estimate that more than 100 million people will travel during this long holiday. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Self-driving has become the mainstream during long vacations. For those car owners who drive to Xi&#39;an, Shaanxi, Mianyang, Sichuan, Xinxiang, Henan and other places, this year&#39;s journey will have a lot less worries: the traffic police departments in these places recently announced that minor violations of foreign tourists&#39; vehicles will not be punished during the holidays. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such &quot;flexible law enforcement&quot; measures are generally welcomed by car owners. The car is in a different place and the road in life is unfamiliar. Even if you have a navigation system, various situations will inevitably happen. If you are slapped with a ticket and fined for this, you may not be in a good mood for the whole day. There are no penalties for minor violations of laws by foreign vehicles. This will allow foreign tourists to relax and have fun without having to worry about getting into trouble or losing money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The actions of the traffic police in these places are not illegal, but based on evidence. The Administrative Penalty Law clearly stipulates that if the violation is minor and is corrected in a timely manner without causing harmful consequences, no administrative penalty will be imposed; if the violation is for the first time and the harmful consequences are minor and the harmful consequences are corrected in a timely manner, administrative penalties may not be imposed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, the fundamental purpose of punishing traffic violations is to ensure safe and smooth traffic and improve traffic efficiency. If some minor violations do not cause traffic congestion or affect traffic safety and traffic efficiency, they do not need to be punished. If you use a high-power magnifying glass to see defects and you are punished for minor violations, it becomes a fine for the sake of fines, which is putting the cart before the horse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, tourism has become an important economic driving force in many cities. To attract tourists, in addition to unique attractions, the soft environment is also an important aspect of attraction. For example, this year&#39;s Zibo barbecue fire caused many tourists from out of town to come by car. There was no room in the parking lot, so some people parked their cars on the roadside. Faced with these illegally parked out-of-town vehicles, the Zibo traffic police did not come up and issue a punishment note. Instead, they called each one to notify them to move the vehicles. This practice was praised and attracted more people to Zibo to eat barbecue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, there were some places that had &quot;extremely strict law enforcement&quot; on foreign car owners. I drive this road, and when foreign car owners come, they have to find faults and fines. Some places even deliberately set up law enforcement traps to punish outsiders. In this way, foreign car owners are treated as &quot;water fish&quot;, and they will not come next time. Not only will they not come, they will also post online to appeal to others not to come. When such word-of-mouth evaluation spreads, there will naturally be fewer and fewer tourists, and the tourism economy will be out of the question. On the contrary, if foreign tourists are &quot;softly enforced&quot; and try not to be punished, so that tourists feel comfortable, they may stay here for a few more days. Next time they come, they will take the initiative to do voluntary publicity online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, foreign car owners who enjoy flexible law enforcement treatment must also consciously abide by traffic rules, try not to violate the rules, do not create congestion in the local area, and be decent in both directions. After all, only good traffic order can bring a relaxing and pleasant travel experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The tourism environment is part of the business environment and a reflection of the overall business environment. There used to be some places that specifically targeted foreign investment merchants. In the early stage, they used various &quot;preferential policies&quot; to attract foreign merchants to invest in and build factories. After that, they started to &quot;harvest the wool&quot;. Not only were the original promises unable to be fulfilled, but they also had to eat all kinds of food. To get the card, &quot;beat the foreign businessmen to internal injuries and strip the domestic businessmen naked.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What kind of business environment there is, there will be what kind of investment enthusiasm. From the tourism environment to the business environment, they are essentially a reflection of the level of local public governance. Paying attention to one&#39;s own reputation and reputation is the basic prerequisite for local public governance to become good governance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 11:55:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“遛街子”累麻了，年轻人开始了“宅”式度假]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257631]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https:// feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“不是我不够努力” ：被清退的编外人员，如何过难关]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258088]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/04/1hbW3iqPCOVYPyAfvKOHLi72oS4xe6bm0iRJwOfY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/04/1hbW3iqPCOVYPyAfvKOHLi72oS4xe6b m0iRJwOfY. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253009&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 7, 2023, a hospital in Zhejiang Province launched nursing skills training for nurses. Pictures and texts are irrelevant. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;You are no longer from our hospital.&quot; One sentence announced that Chen Min has been a non-staff nurse for ten years The end of a career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In front of two doctors, three bedded patients and their families in the ward, the dismissal notice came suddenly. Staying for a second longer makes you feel embarrassed. In September 2023, Chen Min recalled to Southern Weekend that after hearing the order to leave, she did not hesitate, returned to the office, took off her nurse uniform, took away the cup and notebook, and kept a group photo with the department. In the cupboard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eight months ago, Chen Ming just turned 35 and became the first batch of labor dispatch workers dismissed from a second-class hospital in Hunan where she worked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past ten years, she has shuttled between wards and departments, looking no different from other nurses. But somewhere invisible, there is always a thread named &quot;weaving&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Using this line as the boundary, people like Chen Min who work in state agencies or institutions in the form of labor dispatch but are not within the establishment are called &quot;non-staff personnel.&quot; In addition, common non-staff personnel include “contract workers” hired by government agencies, hospitals, schools and other units who sign contracts with workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, information about “retiring non-staff personnel” that has appeared from time to time has attracted attention to this group. In 2022, Fangxian County, Hubei Province promoted the standardization of the clean-up of non-staff employed personnel, and stated that &quot;the clean-up of non-staff personnel involves a wide range of areas and a large number&quot;, and the clean-up process needs to &quot;effectively safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of government agencies, institutions and non-staff personnel.&quot; In February 2023, a symposium on the clean-up and standardization of non-staff personnel held in Tongcheng City, Anhui Province mentioned that clean-up and retirement is not the ultimate goal, but to standardize and rectify the chaos of non-staff employment and improve government administrative efficiency and service levels. Provide employment assistance for retired personnel, and actively and steadily promote special actions to clean up and standardize non-staff personnel.&quot; In August, the Lichuan City Institutional Establishment Committee Office in Hubei Province stated that the city had eliminated 301 irregular non-staff employees. In Jianli, Hubei, Linxiang, Hunan, Harbin, Heilongjiang and other places, public information shows that the removal of non-staff personnel is also in progress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this wave, some non-staff personnel are deeply frustrated, and some take the opportunity to step out of their comfort zones and look for a decent job again. News from Daoxian County, Yongzhou City, Hunan Province stated that as of September 20, 1,038 laid-off non-staff personnel had been re-employed in the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Premonition of unemployment&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The non-staff personnel interviewed had a premonition of being laid off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as 2022, Chen Min heard from colleagues about the news of eliminating non-staff personnel. At first, he didn’t believe it. Later, he searched online and found that other cities had taken action. But the news only circulated secretly in the hospital, and she never saw the red-headed document. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On December 31, 2022, the contract signed by Chen Min with a third-party labor dispatch company expired. The hospital leader told her that &quot;the epidemic has just ended and there is no time to sign the contract, so she must go to work first.&quot; Just two or three days later, she was fired on the grounds that &quot;the state had issued a policy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2023, similar &quot;gossip&quot; spread in a hospital in Dengta City, Liaoning Province. Li Zhen, 28, has worked in the vaccination department of the hospital for nearly seven years. In this hospital with less than 400 employees, it only takes a few turns for the news to reach her ears. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Li Zhen felt the signal even stronger. Salaries that cannot be paid on time, successive layoffs in other departments, rumors that leaders in charge of each department are fighting to keep their subordinates, the newly appointed dean twice went to the vaccination department and mentioned &quot;there are too many people&quot;... these have given rise to unemployment. The real feeling of pressing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The more precise news came on the night of May 16, the day before she was dismissed. She heard from a relative who had an acquaintance working in the hospital that the layoffs might &quot;be your turn.&quot; A few.&quot; The next day, the leader in charge of the department called: &quot;There is bad news. You can&#39;t keep it this time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zhen said that in the memories of the old nurses at the hospital, there were more than 30 people working in the hospital. This is the first time that no one has been laid off in recent years. The hospital told her, &quot;The hospital now owes money and cannot support so many people. You should understand the hospital.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xiaodong, a professor at the School of Politics and Public Administration at China University of Political Science and Law, analyzed to Southern Weekend the existence of non-staff personnel. There are historical reasons for this and development, which were influenced by the thinking of “more people make things easier” and the increase in workload at that time. When public institutions like hospitals are saturated with workload and existing staff cannot complete the work, they recruit non-staff personnel to assist in the work. And the hospital&#39;s &quot;most of the funds for supporting non-staff personnel come from their own income.&quot; The main reason for dismissing non-staff personnel now may be related to its own profits and policies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Hu Xiaodong mentioned that the &quot;Party and State Institutional Reform Plan&quot; released in March 2023 mentioned streamlining the establishment, but it was limited to central and state agencies and local party and government agencies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Non-staff personnel in some government agencies have been affected before. 29-year-old Lin Jiangtao has been working in a government unit in Yuxi, Yunnan for four years. At the end of December 2022, while he was on paternity leave, he received a notice of competitive employment from the unit. Due to economic layoffs, 36 people outside the establishment were required to undergo written examinations and interviews. Decided to stay or go. &quot;I probably understood it when I heard this. I guess I will be laid off this time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Uneasiness surged in Lin Jiangtao&#39;s heart. He recalled that at that time, he frequently looked at job information on local talent recruitment websites, viewed short videos on social media that taught people how to deal with middle-aged unemployment, and even asked a master to tell fortunes. Lin Jiangtao sent his birth date and work address, and the master told him that he &quot;may not be unemployed.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For insurance, Lin Jiangtao hired a teacher to conduct structured interviews, which cost 1,500 yuan for two days. On December 29, 2022, the day before his birthday, he still received a text message that he was dismissed. He was competing for the last place in the induction examination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The removal of non-staff personnel is related to the reduction of staff. Hu Xiaodong explained that the key to the increase or decrease of establishment is whether the use of establishment can improve work efficiency. Nowadays, non-staff personnel in government departments at all levels bear the actual work of many internal staff. “It is necessary to return the civil servant work performed or replaced by existing non-staff personnel to the civil servants themselves and return the responsibilities of civil servants.” &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Before the crisis&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After graduating from technical secondary school, Li Zhen once thought about working in Shenyang, which is 40 to 50 minutes&#39; drive away from home. As the only child in the family, her father was reluctant to let her go away, so he asked someone to find connections to get her to come to this hospital. Although the average salary was only more than 2,000 yuan a month, &quot;as long as she has a place to occupy herself.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are eight people in the vaccination department, all of whom are &quot;contract workers.&quot; Li Zhen is mainly responsible for vaccine information registration in the department. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Almost all children in the county are vaccinated at their hospital. During busy times, it takes three hours in the morning to register the information of about a hundred children. Over time, Li Zhen developed the habit of speaking and typing quickly. When I met the children and parents who came for vaccination, I blurted out three key questions in Northeastern dialect: &quot;Is the child sick, has he taken medicine, and is he healthy?&quot; In the time it takes a new colleague to enter the information of one child, Li Zhen can enter the information of three. As soon as he sees the child&#39;s age in months, he knows which injection should be given to the child. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you have free time, you can get off work early after finishing your busy morning. &quot;The job is easy, the salary is fixed&quot;, and there is also medical insurance and pension insurance paid by the hospital - this is already a good job in a small county. Li Zhen has no mortgage, car loan or children, and her husband&#39;s monthly salary is five to six thousand yuan. They live a stress-free life in a small county with low prices. With the idea of ​​&quot;leaving this place for retirement&quot;, Li Zhen never thought of leaving. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the unemployment crisis, many people believed that non-staff work could be done &quot;until retirement&quot; because it was &quot;close to the establishment.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same goes for Lin Jiangtao. In his view, his job is no different from that of a clerk, &quot;delivering information, setting up accounts, and at most compiling information at the end of the year.&quot; Because of the nature of the company, I need to go to the company for safety inspections, and I don’t have to strictly stay on duty. There are also five insurances paid by the company. “I can’t find a more satisfying (job) than this.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When &quot;Lingping&quot; was in the unit, two or three non-staff colleagues left because they were admitted to civil servants or public institutions. Lin Jiangtao felt envious, but did not act. It wasn&#39;t until he lost his job that he realized how &quot;fragrant&quot; the establishment was. If the time could go back ten years, he would like to advise his 19-year-old self to make a good life plan and consider taking a job. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the cruel reality is that even if Lin Jiangtao goes back to ten years ago and tries his best to take the exam, the result may not be satisfactory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Min spent ten years preparing for the exam. From the time she got a part-time job, her life was spent working and preparing for exams. After get off work every night, her schedule is to go back to her room to read and prepare for exams. She is unable to respond to her colleagues&#39; calls to eat and play cards, and she cannot &quot;waste&quot; more time cooking or spending time with her family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike the comfort Lin Jiangtao felt at work, Chen Min&#39;s work in the hospital was unstable. In the past ten years, she has been rotated through at least eight departments. The shortest one she stayed in was only half a year, and the doctors in the department were not fully recognized. The longest one was less than three years. When I go to some new departments, I even have to start from scratch. However, the transfer of colleagues within the staff will not be so frequent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In her perception, hospital employees are divided into four levels based on employment forms. The highest level is within the establishment, followed by personnel agency, labor contract, and labor dispatch. Dispatched workers also have five insurances and one housing fund, but their wages are the lowest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The difference buried in daily work always reminds me that I am a &quot;non-staff person&quot;, and the age limit of &quot;under 35 years old&quot; for the staff examination is tightly pressed, which further intensifies Chen Min&#39;s pursuit of staff. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whenever there is a recruitment announcement in her hospital, Chen Min will sign up. On several occasions, she passed the written exam but was dropped again after the interview. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/04/HUsJgmRsZHd34X3wdBGavXwIPRGxouwipDVaif7w.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;768&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/04/HUsJgmRsZHd34X3wdBGavXwIPRGxouwipDVaif7w.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253010&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Many places require that the removal of non-staff personnel be actively and steadily promoted. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Survival and Emotion&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After being fired, for more than a month, Chen Min is immersed in anxiety and relies on medication to maintain sleep every day. At a rehabilitation hospital near her home, Chen Min was diagnosed with moderate depression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The treating doctor advised Chen Min to learn to look away and not push herself too hard. Her parents-in-law also told her that it didn’t matter if she didn’t go to work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For those who have accumulated some &quot;capital&quot; after working for many years, after losing their jobs, survival is not the first concern that arises, but emotions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Over the past few years, Chen Min considers himself devoted to his work. Her home is close to the hospital, only ten minutes&#39; walk. When she was not working the night shift, she also told the doctors and nurses after work, &quot;If you are too busy at night, just call me and I will come right away.&quot; Her WeChat ID is still left in the previous department for patients Appointments, consultations, return visits. Chen Min described her work as her lover, and the sudden unemployment felt like being separated from her lover. &quot;It will probably be difficult to get out of it within a year or two.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For retired non-staff personnel, a buffer period may be needed. Hu Xiaodong mentioned that for the sake of humanistic care, the unit should set up a buffer period to &quot;give them a buffer space from psychology to behavior. The unit can also help non-staff personnel who are about to be laid off find new jobs in accordance with laws and regulations.&quot; In addition, he also suggested designing a return-to-work appointment system. When these non-staff personnel are needed again in the future, units can give priority to hiring personnel with return-to-work certificates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to divert his attention and renew his suspended social security payment, Chen Min began to look for a new job. Health care centers, specialized hospitals, private clinics, confinement centers, and places related to nursing are the first to be considered. More than ten years ago, she applied for the nursing major because &quot;it was easy to find a job.&quot; Now the number of nurses has exceeded 5 million, and employers have more and younger choices. Chen Min said that because she was over 35 years old, she was either unable to register for the exam or was not accepted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Jiangtao also encountered a similar situation. He saw a job opening at a vocational training company on the local talent recruitment website. On the day of the interview, his boss, who was in his forties, introduced to him what he had achieved in his twenties and asked him: &quot;Why are you still looking for a job at the age of 29?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Jiangtao restrained his emotions. , replied calmly: &quot;Why can&#39;t you find a job at the age of 29? People who are 59, 69 or even 79 may be looking for a job.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he first lost his job, Lin Jiangtao also had self-doubt. But soon, he told himself that when he was at a low point in his life, he must not push himself too hard or go against himself; when he encountered a suitable opportunity, he would take the initiative to fight for it, but there was no need to be too anxious. &quot;Looking for a job is like looking for a partner, take your time.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Step out of the comfort zone&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From May to August, Li Zhen rested at home for three months. Not long ago, he went to Nantong, Jiangsu, intending to try home textile live broadcast. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are requirements for live broadcasts. You must dress fashionably and wear heavy makeup. You can&#39;t just wear sportswear and white shoes on the inside, a nurse&#39;s uniform on the outside, and light makeup like you do in the hospital. Even when he speaks, he pays attention to standard Mandarin. &quot;After speaking Northeastern dialect for so many years, it suddenly feels so awkward.&quot; Li Zhen stood next to the anchor, feeling a sense of discomfort that made her shrink back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After staying in Jiangsu for half a month, Li Zhen returned to his hometown and spent 7 days learning to make milk tea locally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September, she and her friends opened a milk tea shop near the school. Although it was more tiring, she could adapt. The work is busier than before, but she thinks that the more work she does, the more she will get. &quot;Maybe by selling this extra hour, I can make more money. I think it is for myself.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people have taken bigger steps, such as Chen Min, who moved from the hospital to small restaurants and barbecue stalls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After looking for a job for more than a month and asking for more than 20 nursing-related positions, Chen Min still found nothing. After consulting teachers from her previous school, she turned to preparing for the Licensed Pharmacist Qualification Certificate. If she passed the exam, she could work in a chain pharmacy. &quot;It&#39;s relatively stable and there&#39;s no age limit.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But before that, I have to find a job to transition. Chen Min walked along the street from shop to shop until he saw a notice recruiting waiters at a small restaurant on the street, and worked as a waiter there. After being introduced by the restaurant owner&#39;s wife, I came to work part-time as a dishwasher at a nearby barbecue stall. The total of the two salaries is not much different from that of working in the hospital. Chen Min also paid social security again in the form of flexible employment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Chen Min still has her own concerns about these two jobs. When looking for a job, she deliberately avoided being near the hospital because she didn&#39;t want to run into her former colleagues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When working in the hospital, the nurses wear the same uniforms and masks, with their eyes exposed. Most of the time, patients have difficulty even distinguishing nurses with different appearances, and they treat nurses with the same courtesy and respect. But after taking off her nurse&#39;s uniform and mask, she was still a little worried when facing the guests, food and dishes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now her time is divided into four periods. She gets up at 7 a.m. to prepare for the exam, works as a waiter in a restaurant from 10:30 a.m. to 7 p.m., then washes dishes at a barbecue stall, and returns around 12 p.m. home, and then continue reading until 2 o&#39;clock in the morning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her parents-in-law still take care of everything at home for her, and her husband also supports her to continue taking exams and do what she wants to do. Occasionally, my 7-year-old son saw Chen Min reading in her room and brought her own books to keep her company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On social media, Chen Min wrote: &quot;My failure to pass the establishment examination is definitely not because I didn&#39;t work hard enough, but I still believe that hard work will reward me in another way.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Chen Min, Li Zhen and Lin Jiangtao are pseudonyms)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>; Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[调停俄乌冲突，百岁基辛格的功绩与争议丨智库视点]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258084]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On September 24, 2023 local time, according to the &quot;Ukrainian Pravda&quot; report, Ukrainian President Zelensky During his recent visit to the United States, he met with former US Secretary of State Kissinger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Andrei Yermak, director of the Ukrainian Presidential Office, posted the above news on social media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kissinger visited China two months ago and attended the Bund Financial Summit online on September 23. The centenarian is still playing his part on the international stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Why Kissinger is still active&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The world today is facing huge risks, unlike any risks since the Cold War. Previous risks, whether the United States sent troops to Afghanistan or Iraq, occurred between world powers and small and medium-sized countries, and the risk of escalation is unlikely. But this time, it has become a confrontation between world powers and a strategic confrontation between nuclear powers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Great Game between Russia and the West behind it have had a strong impact on the post-Cold War world order. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine marks a serious challenge to the post-Cold War world order. On the other hand, this is also the first indirect confrontation between Russia and the US and Western camps after the Cold War. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Yermak&#39;s account, Kissinger told Zelensky during the meeting, &quot;Before this war, I opposed Ukraine joining NATO because I was worried that it would set in motion the war we are seeing now. process (the outbreak of the conflict). Now this process has reached such an extent that the idea of ​​​​keeping Ukraine neutral in this situation no longer makes sense.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not the first time Kissinger has mentioned Ukraine joining NATO. On May 17, The Economist published an exclusive interview with Kissinger. During the interview, Kissinger stated that he supports Ukraine&#39;s membership of NATO. He also said: &quot;Ukraine should continue to be protected by Europe, rather than becoming an isolated country that protects itself on its own.&quot; Regarding Russia, Kissinger said, &quot;If I talk to (Russian President) Putin, I will tell him , Ukraine will be safer if it stays in NATO.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Kissinger called on all parties to sit down and carry out diplomatic negotiations. He warned that there is now a risk that the great powers&#39; military relationships dominate their geopolitical calculations. The Russia-Ukraine conflict may therefore develop into a global conflict, and diplomatic negotiations will become &quot;increasingly important.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, Sino-US relations have undergone qualitative changes since the Trump era. Conflict has begun to replace cooperation and become the key word in Sino-US relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, the relationship between the world&#39;s major powers, represented by the relationship between China, the United States and Russia, has become very dangerous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this context, Kissinger became increasingly worried about Sino-US relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on June 16, Kissinger said in an interview with the media that Sino-US relations are on &quot;a cliff&quot; and &quot;the current trajectory of the relationship must change.&quot; Later, Kissinger also said that the Cold War between China and the United States is now &quot;walking on a mountain road.&quot; Kissinger believes that China and the United States &quot;both believe that the other side poses a strategic threat. We are moving towards a confrontation between major powers.&quot; This is a process that &quot;should not continue&quot;. Once a conflict breaks out between China and the United States, it will be comparable to World War I. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, Kissinger actively mediates the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and drags his old body to visit China, which is an attempt to stabilize Sino-US relations and exert his residual energy. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Why Kissinger? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the United States, there are many influential strategists. There are also many people who are worried about the international situation and are trying to improve Russia-Ukraine relations and Sino-U.S. relations. But why Kissinger and not someone else? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, Kissinger has a superstitious admiration and sense of mission for the United States. As a German Jew who escaped the Nazi regime, to hold a high position in the United States is an example of an American success story. This also makes him always grateful to the United States. He once wrote: &quot;The same generosity of spirit and lack of malice can be found anywhere else.&quot; This almost sentimental gratitude and admiration for the United States made him serve the United States at all costs in diplomacy and devote himself to Maximize the national interests of the United States. For this reason, he did not hesitate to sacrifice his personal beliefs and did not care about his personal success or failure, reaching the height of &quot;living and dying for the benefit of the country, how can he avoid it for the sake of misfortunes and blessings&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, more than half of Kissinger’s diplomatic achievements are in Sino-US relations. Kissinger is an eyewitness and operator of America&#39;s transformation from decline to prosperity. If President Nixon had not accepted his suggestion, destroyed the Sino-Soviet alliance, and shifted the strategic focus of the United States from Asia to Europe, it would have been difficult for the United States to win the Cold War in this way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he entered American politics, the United States was experiencing its lowest point after World War II, and was experiencing triple crises in foreign strategy, economy, and society. The United States was trapped in the Vietnam War and was unable to extricate itself; it was in economic difficulties, and the U.S. dollar lost its ability and credibility to redeem gold; domestic society was in chaos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Kissinger left American politics, the United States had successfully transformed China from an enemy of the United States into a &quot;friendly non-ally&quot; of the United States against the Soviet Union. Although the U.S. dollar can no longer be redeemed freely with gold, it has been tied back to the oil trade, achieving an upgrade from the U.S. dollar to an international standard currency. The U.S. dollar has transformed from an intermediary in world economic and trade to a truly hegemonic currency and an international standard currency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These all make Kissinger unique and a myth and legend in the diplomatic community. His status and influence in international politics, especially in Sino-US relations, are irreplaceable. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Symbol of the Times&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On June 16, 2023, according to Xinhua News Agency, Kissinger said in an interview with the media that American politics is polarized , is currently &quot;overly focused&quot; on its own interests, and if its foreign policy fails to balance the interests of the United States and the world, the United States &quot;will become isolated.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why Sino-US relations turned from hostility to cooperation was that both countries had to deal with the threat from the Soviet Union. However, without Kissinger&#39;s insight and courage, it would be difficult for China-US relations to quickly restart in such a bad bilateral relationship. The symbolic effect produced by this overlapping interaction between individuals and times is something that no one else can possess. Kissinger has become a symbol, a symbol of an era, and is unrepeatable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historically, it was a product of the times when China and the United States united to fight against the Soviet Union during difficult times. When Kissinger secretly visited China, it was the Soviet Union&#39;s rise and hardening period, and it was a difficult period for China and the United States. The handshake between China and the United States across the Pacific and across the ideological divide not only created a diplomatic legend, but also stabilized the world situation at the time and destined the outcome of the Cold War in advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Kissinger came to China, he saw the strategic contradictions and ideological differences between China and the Soviet Union, and wanted to contact China to jointly fight the Soviet Union. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this sense, China and the United States have become the biggest beneficiaries of the end of the Cold War. After the end of the Cold War, both China and the United States were able to get rid of security concerns, reduce security burdens, and focus on economic development. The rise of China in the world and the rise of the United States within the Western camp complement each other. It can be said that Kissinger&#39;s personal luck lies in standing at a turning point in Sino-US relations and the world structure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On a personal level, Kissinger is often called a realist, mainly because he puts strategic thinking ahead of ideology. This distinguishes Kissinger from the current strategic researchers in the United States who are guided by ideology. However, he did not take ideological factors into consideration. In fact, he calls his foreign policy principles &quot;liberal internationalism,&quot; which is equivalent to the neoconservatism of the George W. Bush era. It is the product of combining the emphasis on values, internationalist principles, and diplomacy based on national strength. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is precisely because of this kind of liberal internationalism that he offended the two US presidents, Trump and Biden. On November 25, 2020, Trump fired Kissinger from his position as an advisor to the U.S. Defense Policy Council. However, he is also dissatisfied with Biden&#39;s withdrawal from Afghanistan, believing it to be an irresponsible act that betrays the tradition of U.S. foreign policy dating back to President Wilson. One result of expressing this rhetoric is that Biden inherits Trump&#39;s approach to Kissinger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, there are many talents in the U.S. strategic field, and many of the younger generation of strategic people than Kissinger have also withdrawn from the stage. The young and middle-aged strategic talents in the United States are now leading the charge in the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, age is a major advantage for Kissinger. Kissinger is 100 years old and has outlived all his friends and opponents. Kissinger is the only 100-year-old international politician in the world who is still active and has great influence. This makes Kissinger&#39;s role largely unrepeatable. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Can Kissinger be copied? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Kissinger is a product of his times. Times cannot be repeated, and Kissinger cannot be copied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, the shape of Sino-US relations has changed. During the Cold War, the biggest external threat to China and the United States was the Soviet Union. For the sake of their own security, China and the United States have established a quasi-alliance system across the ideological divide, which is in line with their own interests. Now, as China has unprecedentedly entered the center of the world&#39;s power stage, Sino-US relations have become the most important bilateral relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, the characteristics of diplomacy have changed. The realists represented by Kissinger advocate personal factors and are superstitious about secret diplomacy. This was already outdated by the end of the Cold War. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kissinger was obsessed with those passionate years throughout his life, and was intoxicated by the thrill and excitement of secretly boarding a plane from Pakistan to Beijing. In the post-Cold War era, especially in the era of highly transparent and open self-media, these individual heroic diplomatic behaviors are difficult to reproduce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Kissinger’s influence in the United States has declined much faster than in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the context of the new era, many Americans are also reflecting on and challenging Kissinger&#39;s past contributions and achievements. The famous international relations scholar Hans Morgenthau has long said that Kissinger, like Odysseus in Homer&#39;s epic poem, &quot;has many facades.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the United States, there are two descriptions of Kissinger: one is a liar. This person never tells the truth, always speaks ambiguous words, and almost never makes clear public comments on major events. This may be one of the secrets of his longevity in the world of international relations. Second, Kissinger is an amazing person with an excellent memory. He was an eyewitness and living dictionary of many major events. Christopher Hitchens&#39;s description of Kissinger is perhaps more accurate, calling him &quot;a stunning liar with an incredible memory.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, there is something very dangerous. Compared with Kissinger, whose main achievement was during the Cold War, current American strategists basically grew up in a peaceful atmosphere. For them, peace is no longer the primary goal of international politics, but the premise or background of international politics, which does not need to be fought for or paid for. Therefore, we can see that compared with Kissinger&#39;s concerns about the prospect of conflict, many American strategists seem not to be concerned about the possibility of conflict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, there will not be another Kissinger, but the crisis that Kissinger is worried about will continue to be repeated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a professor at the American Studies Center of Fudan University)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[为啥没有诺贝尔数学奖：因为诺贝尔的妻子被数学家拐跑了？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258076]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;It was not until Nobel&#39;s death in 1896 that his family, friends and colleagues knew that the Swedish billionaire 94% of his property was donated to the foundation to establish 5 awards: Physics Award, Chemistry Award, Physiology or Medicine Award, Literature Award, Peace Award, and held the first award ceremony in 1901 - today, There is also a sixth award, the Nobel Prize in Economics, which was established by the Swedish Central Bank in 1969 to commemorate Nobel, so it is sometimes not regarded as the orthodox Nobel Prize. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether it is the five Nobel Prizes or the six Nobel Prizes, mathematics prizes are not included. As for why, you may have heard a legend: Swedish mathematician Gosta Mittag-Leffler kidnapped Nobel&#39;s wife, so Nobel hated everyone who studied mathematics and refused to establish a mathematics prize from the foundation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is actually a complete rumor. Nobel was never married and had no wife at all. In fact, if Nobel had a wife and children, he might not be able to donate his property to the foundation to establish awards. Therefore, in some versions of the story, it was not Nobel&#39;s wife who was abducted, but his lover. However, when we look back at Nobel&#39;s life today, we will find that this extremely wealthy inventor did not have a smooth relationship. His only two scandal targets had nothing to do with mathematicians. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 21, 1833, a baby boy was born to an intellectual family in Stockholm, Sweden. He was named Alfred Nobel. He later became a famous scientist, inventor, and businessman. and founder of the Nobel Prize. His father, Nobel Sr., was a construction engineer with extensive research in the field of rock blasting. Alfred Nobel later embarked on the path of developing explosives and engineering inventions, which was actually his family background. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in the same year that little Nobel was born, his father&#39;s career was not going well and he went bankrupt due to a construction accident. When he was 4 years old, the old Nobel saw that he could not make money in Sweden, so he decided to go to Finland and Russia to make a living. His wife and children were left behind to guard a small grocery store and eke out a living in Stockholm. As a result, little Nobel lived a very hungry and cold childhood, and did not go to school well. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, old Nobel finally made a name for himself in Russia. He opened a machine shop in St. Petersburg and designed a new type of simple mine to provide equipment for the Russian army: He asked the Tsar and generals It was believed that the mines could prevent enemy ships from approaching the capital. During the Crimean War from 1853 to 1856, these mines successfully prevented British naval attacks on St. Petersburg. Russia&#39;s earliest central heating device was also manufactured in the old Nobel factory. The Nobel family was the first in Russia to install central heating. This was a big shock to the country of &quot;General Winter&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With his father&#39;s success in Russia, Nobel&#39;s family moved to St. Petersburg in 1842. Little Nobel, who had not even finished primary school, finally had the opportunity to receive a first-class education. Little Nobel was most interested in literature, chemistry and physics, and left a deep impression on his teachers: he was extremely intelligent but sickly, liked solitude and contemplation, and was particularly fascinated by English literature, especially the poets Byron and Shelley. - As a student, Nobel regarded Shelley&#39;s philanthropy, pacifism, agnosticism and atheism as his guiding principles in life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the elder Nobel hoped that his sons could inherit their father&#39;s legacy and was dissatisfied with the younger Nobel&#39;s literary ambitions. He then decided to send the young man to study abroad to become a chemical engineer. In this way, the young Nobel came to Paris to study under the famous chemist Peroz. Under Professor Perozzi, he met Sobrero, a young Italian chemist. Three years ago, Sobrero invented nitroglycerin, a highly explosive liquid. Sobrero thought the thing was too dangerous to be of practical use. However, Nobel was very interested in nitroglycerin and believed that it had great future in engineering. After he completed his studies and returned to Russia, he and his father started the research and development of nitroglycerin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But by then the Crimean War had ended, and my father’s business was deteriorating, and he finally had to move back to Sweden. Nobel&#39;s two brothers remained in Russia, trying to save what was left of the family business. They eventually succeeded, turning to the emerging oil industry in southern Russia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1863, Nobel returned to Sweden with his father and concentrated on developing nitroglycerin dynamite. Unfortunately, these experiments went awry, resulting in the deaths of several people, including Nobel&#39;s brother Emile. The Swedish government has ordered a ban on explosives testing within the city of Stockholm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Nobel did not give up and moved the experiment to a barge on Lake Mälaren in Sweden. In 1866, his experiments finally achieved a breakthrough: by mixing nitroglycerin with a type of fine sand called diatomaceous earth, the liquid could be turned into a paste, and dynamite sticks could be made. He also incidentally invented the detonator, which could be detonated by lighting a fuse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike his father who studied mines, Nobel, as a pacifist, put these inventions into civilian fields, such as drilling tunnels, blasting rocks, and building canals. The invention of explosives and detonators greatly reduced project costs and immediately became popular in the construction industry. Nobel therefore set up factories in 90 different places, but demand still exceeded supply. He lived in Paris but frequently traveled to his factories in more than 20 countries, earning him the nickname &quot;Europe&#39;s richest tramp&quot; by Victor Hugo. He also developed synthetic rubber, leather and rayon, and obtained 355 patents in his lifetime, making him a veritable invention king. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Intensive work and travel left this inventor with no time to solve personal problems, and he has always been a bachelor. It was not until the age of 43 that Nobel hired Bertha Kinski, a multilingual and well-educated Austrian housekeeper. Nobel fell in love with her at first sight, but Bertha already had a crush on her. After working for Nobel for a short period of time, she decided to return to Austria to marry her fiancé. Despite this, Nobel and Bertha became good friends and continued to write to each other for decades. Bertha was a well-known anti-war activist and wrote the masterpiece &quot;Lay Down Your Arms&quot;. She had a great influence on Nobel, not only strengthening Nobel&#39;s pacifist belief, but also the key to Nobel&#39;s final establishment of the Peace Prize. After Nobel&#39;s death, the Norwegian Parliament awarded the 1905 Nobel Peace Prize to Bertha. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nobel’s second relationship originated from a commercial trip in the autumn of 1876. Nobel came to Austria and met the poor and beautiful girl Sophia. Nobel was attracted by her frankness and beauty, and Sophia was attracted by Nobel&#39;s money - it was obvious that this relationship was doomed to tragedy from the beginning. Nobel loved and cared for Sophia, gave her money, spent time teaching her, and tried to improve her moral character and knowledge, but to no avail. Sofia became more and more willful and took up a lover in the luxurious Paris apartment prepared for her by Nobel. Nobel decided to break up several times, but he couldn&#39;t stand Sophia&#39;s entanglement and indulged her willfulness year after year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since his student days, Nobel has been introverted and lonely, and was once hospitalized for treatment for depression. Continuous emotional difficulties aggravated his illness, so much so that he once wrote: &quot;Only in dogs can you find many friends.&quot; In his later years, Nobel suffered from hearing problems and angina, and the doctor recommended that he take nitric acid Glycerin - this is the explosive ingredient that made him famous. Nobel complained in a letter to his relatives and friends: &quot;It seems like an irony of fate that they prescribed nitroglycerin for oral administration to me!&quot; To this day, nitroglycerin is still an effective drug for the treatment of acute angina. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the spring of 1891, just five years before Nobel&#39;s death, Sophia wrote him another letter asking for money on the grounds that she was pregnant. But Nobel knew that the child&#39;s father was a young Hungarian officer, and the two were preparing to get married. The main source of income for this young couple after their marriage was shamelessly writing to Nobel asking for a huge sum of money - and in Nobel&#39;s will, he actually took out a large sum of money from the remaining 6%. To Sophia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the Swedish mathematician Gosta Mittag-Leffler who is rumored to have kidnapped Nobel’s wife, he was 13 years younger than Nobel. When Nobel moved to France, he was still there. go to school. Gosta had nothing to do with Nobel throughout his life, but he had a lot to do with the Nobel Prize: he was elected as a member of the Nobel Prize Committee in 1903, and insisted on awarding the Nobel Prize to Curie against all odds. A couple, not Mr. Curie alone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is the author&#39;s personal opinion only and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[奇峰峻岭“外星谷”丨指尖华夏⑥]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257589]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-04 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The Alien Valley Interstellar Theme Geopark has protruding peaks, rugged rock pillars, steep ridges and colorful mountains.

You would think that those salesmen you meet in a noisy restaurant who are engrossed in eating with their colleagues, wearing short-sleeved white shirts day after day, and thinking about which shared bicycle monthly pass to buy when they leave, behind the lean and ordinary appearance In fact, they are all experts at experiencing life. They absorb everything around them delicately and keenly, and when they return to their shared home, they all become Kafka. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Crashing into the Sky&quot; is a novel published in August 2023. The protagonist in the book is a clerk working in downtown Guangzhou. The pen name of the person who wrote it is You Yu. He is in his early 30s and is naturally also known as I think I have had similar experiences. Of course, he also took some classes that were neither salty nor bland, and also ran a restaurant selling braised chicken. But when he started writing this novel with a rich sense of place, it had only been two or three years since he moved to Guangzhou, and he had only a few encounters with the streets that appear repeatedly in the story. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With no intention of finding a job, he decided to come to Guangzhou to live a low-cost creative life with the money he earned from opening a restaurant. After inspecting several district libraries, and taking into account the environment, the flow of people, and the rent, he rented one at the terminus of the subway line and went to the nearby Huangpu District Library from nine to five every day to write. According to the air-conditioning vents in the four seasons, The scenery outside the window changes the favorite seats in the museum, listening to Bach&#39;s unaccompanied cello suites, and constructing the life of office workers 30 kilometers away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is completely different from the type of novelist who needs to be rooted in a strange environment for a long time before he can write confidently. In his eyes, the external life that others try to figure out is like being covered with a tight and difficult-to-remove plastic film. Transparent and fragile bubbles that pop when poked. While shopping, he felt that his brain was uncontrollably breaking through physical boundaries, spreading and landing on everything around him. Buildings, chairs, and even the moving light spots on a small leaf were all sending information to him in a steady stream. . It is so abundant that it can even become a burden, causing you to almost collapse every time you go home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After starting to write, he finally found a way to release. Occasionally speaking about this &quot;trouble&quot;, he seemed to tentatively wipe the dust on the cabinet wall with his index finger. Only when he saw a clumsy and obvious trace did he realize, oh, it turns out that other people are different from me. Critic Li Jing fully felt his &quot;idiosyncrasies&quot; and described him as being like a radar, always in a state of sensing the situation around him. &quot;And he seems to be completely unable to ignore any kind of information or any kind of situation. He can react in his mind at any time, and express this reaction in a particularly precise, poetic language.&quot; She called him &quot;The opposite of Medusa&quot; means that wherever he looks, all solid objects dissolve into living, liquid or gaseous objects, becoming music, birds, and life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you think back, this &quot;special ability&quot; seems to have nothing to do with location. He could not escape this experience in his hometown in Henan when he was studying and in Shanghai when he was working. The division in time is even more obvious. &quot;The moment I learned that my mother died in a car accident, my hearing seemed to be different all of a sudden. There were dozens of people around, and everyone was talking, but I could hear them all. What are you talking about? I cried all of a sudden, but actually I didn’t feel sad in my heart. What happened to death? Many people around me praised me for being sensible and knowing how to cry. Instead, they gave me a kind of encouragement and made me cry. Even harder, letting me know that I should cry even more. Before, as a child, the entire adult world was actually surrounded by a wall, but after that, you will feel that the dam collapsed all of a sudden, and it poured directly into my body like a flood ( (in front of me). I have personally experienced the changes in every relationship, not only with family members, but also with anyone in the surrounding environment. Everything is changing. This change made me particularly clearly aware of how to come up with a relationship that is consistent with the situation. Everyone is expecting it, but in fact I know in my heart that I am performing for everyone to see.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For fear of disturbing others, his already low volume was lowered. From the first floor to the second floor, we changed seats three times, but we still couldn&#39;t escape the fate of being overwhelmed by the sound, other people&#39;s conversations, and the static of the coffee machine. With an anxious mood, I struggled to salvage his weak response - I had sold insurance, managed the Tmall flagship store of a pet company, had outstanding performance in after-sales work at a software sales company, and had to deal with endless abuse from customers. He was very patient, but when his boss promoted him to lead the team, he resigned decisively. He regards work as a mechanical performance, &quot;I just don&#39;t believe in evil and still have to do it. In fact, I am just avoiding writing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When faced with questions, he rarely responds directly, with a novelist&#39;s narrative The rhythm is not as simple as taking a small detour, but going straight to a completely unrelated route, suddenly braking when you are not sure whether you will come back - &quot;I&#39;ll tell you from the beginning.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; h4>;Avoid writing&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You have wanted to write a long time ago ? Have you thought about it before going to work in Shanghai? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Youyu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Tell the truth, it’s really the truth. I have loved reading since I could learn to read, but at that time we couldn&#39;t afford books. Apart from textbooks, I read wherever I can see words, such as fertilizer bags, ingredient lists on pesticide labels, and opening paper balls. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first time I read a book was probably after my mother passed away. She passed away when I was in the fourth grade of elementary school. My sisters were in junior high school at that time, and they brought books back several times on the weekends, including &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and &quot;Jane Eyre.&quot; At that time, I didn&#39;t understand much about romance and didn&#39;t remember the specific plot. After watching it, I felt that these people were weird and interesting, and they were different from the people around me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Do you still remember the feeling of reading a book at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;You Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The clearest feeling is &quot;War and Peace&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I entered junior high school—I lived on campus at that time—I would ride a few kilometers to the school in the town every Sunday evening. In the beginning, I had to use meal stamps to eat at school. I had to carry a bag of wheat to the flour mill next to the school and give it to the cooperative flour mill. I then took the note to the accountant and exchanged it for meal stamps. When I was in the second grade of junior high school, the price of food seemed to have gone up a bit. My dad did some math and thought it might be more cost-effective to give me money, so he gave me only 10 yuan a week. But he didn&#39;t realize that I was growing stronger and my appetite had increased. (I) was hungry every meal. I knew it was very difficult to make money at that time, so I didn’t say anything. Occasionally, I can have a good meal at my aunt&#39;s house, so now that I see my dear aunt, I still feel full and feel very at ease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有一次我们进到一个书店，到处都是盗版的李凉、古龙的书，托尔斯泰和雨果的则在角落里瑟瑟发抖。那时候肯定买不起，一块多也买不起，毕竟饭都吃不饱。最终不知道怎么攒出来几块钱，可能过了几个月，暑假前买了两本，一本是《战争与和平》，另一本真想不起来了。买回去之后翻开，第一页那个字密密麻麻，还有好多法语。那时连天下雨，铺天盖地。地面上全是黄水，树枝有时候会被刮掉，雨声交杂着夏末最后一批蝉声和鸟窝被吹散后幼鸟发出的惨叫。在这些声音下，我在堂屋的躺椅上看《战争与和平》，天黑也没太意识到。我爸不知道从哪儿冒出来，说天这么黑了，都毁眼了。因为当时电线给刮断了，我就挪到门口的廊子下，一直看到彻底没有光线之后。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;小说主人公何小河还是有很多你的影子？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;宥予：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;会有，最起码死亡的经历是有的。他的母亲、他也一样在广漂、他喜欢吃的东西……很多事确实是我的。但我和他不一样，而且我写《撞空》的时候特别警惕。因为离我们都太近了，一不小心就容易写出那种失意者的自怜，写出一种好像加了人工奶油般的浪漫，一种泛滥的温情。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以我在写的时候不敢爱他们中的任何一个人，有一只眼睛始终在盯着自己。但凡写着写着察觉到要动情了，我都会停下来，然后在图书馆溜达溜达，再重新检查一遍，确认没有我的情绪进去再接着写。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;何小河对事情的看法感受有哪些跟你是不一样的？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;宥予：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;很多，我也没办法概括分析，我觉得他会收敛，为人处事上我比他更虚伪一点。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;他已经很虚伪了。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;宥予：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我比他更虚伪。有些事需要我公开表达的时候，我并不怕，但是我说完之后，会特别讨厌我说的每一句话。因为我很清晰地意识到，我说的时候，有四个我在起作用，一个是我期望中的我，一个是我想让别人看到的我，一个是我以为的我，还有一个更本源的我。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;哪怕我知道更本源的我是什么，我也没法把我以为的我给抹除掉，然后我也没办法不去做想让别人看到的我。整个过程中我知道我的虚荣、我的虚伪、我的矫饰，还有我的真诚和坦然其实是同时存在的。可能这四个统一起来成为完整的一个时，那是真正真实的。假这样，我可能会没那么厌恶自己。我不知道别人会不会这样，你会有这种（感受）吗？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;我可能没那么多，不至于厌恶我说过的话。你以前工作的经历中会需要经常对公众讲话吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;宥予：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;卖保险的时候，还有晨会、年会也要做主持。写作之后我本来不觉得大家会需要我来讲自己，可能只需要说我是怎么写的就好了。上一次在佛山宣传彭剑斌的新书时，和他们见面，意识到他们会对我产生好奇，为什么会这样？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尤其那时候是我第一次真正地见读者，看那一张张脸，之前我都是一个人在图书馆写。对谈结束后有一个女生来问我，她说她也在写，但是有点迷茫。那时候我意识到虽说我的回答未必有那么大的作用，但可能会有那么一点点小影响。这个东西让我觉得还挺恐慌，挺怕的。我就尽可能把我真诚的东西讲出来，才让我不那么恐慌。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我以前其实不热爱文学，我之所以写是因为这的确是我能找到的我和世界和他人和自己相处的一个方式。我是遇到了（罗）丹妮还有（王）家胜（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;《撞空》编辑&lt;/span>;）、剑斌他们，我发现他们是真的爱这个东西。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/ZZhNQSFgRSF3aW6SyYg1ZYul5DeG8Hz4D6AbvSxY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;1247&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/ZZhNQSFgRSF3aW6SyYg1ZYul5DeG8Hz4D6AbvSxY.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251371&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;在他们中间你会很有压力吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;宥予：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我没有压力，但是我会有点被感动到。之前我常常觉得文学没用，尤其是在我听到很多人会用“祥林嫂”来讽刺别人的时候，明明很多书里已经把人理解得那么深了，为什么大家还在用那么简单的方式去理解人？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我在《撞空》快结束的时候挺空落的，当时就想到了一个长篇的题材，想用编年体写一个人的二三十年，但我在梳理的时候，发现里面有一个人拿出来好像就是一个很好的中篇。然后我就开始写那个，但那段时间图书馆也不让进，就在房间里写。当时还老犯鼻炎，后来又感染新冠，烧了五天痛苦死了。在那个过程中可能有两三个月写完了那个中篇，四万字左右。其实是不发表的东西，我不太愿意给别人看。写完之后，有一个朋友正好问我，她说她就想看点东西，问我有没有。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她上班，不写东西，也没看过《撞空》。我就把那个以母女为线的中篇故事给她看了。下午发的，到晚上的时候她看完了，说心里堵得厉害、憋得难受。之后她给妈妈打了个电话，两人第一次在电话里痛哭流涕，她第一次听妈妈说年轻时候的事，听她单纯作为一个女人的时候，她的爱、她的情感。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我没觉得我写得多好，或者说真起那么大作用，可能在那个时间点上确实让她有一个契机，终于愿意和母亲有那样一个沟通。如果我写的东西对这么具体的一个人稍微有这么一点作用的话，我心里是会有点慰藉的感觉。她和她妈妈从那之后，一直保持相对好的沟通方式。互相有了信任和支撑，想到这个我还很开心的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你还写过一个关于父女的故事，主角为什么选择广州西关的一个女人？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;宥予：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;一开始不是写“西关的女人”。一开始是做了一个梦，我梦见非洲的沙漠里有个叫赛里史龙洞的地方，里面有一条龙，那里的人以喝龙奶为生，醒来之后慢慢地就写出来一个男人生活在广州，但是他一闭眼就会有另一个身份，去赛里史龙洞的一个故事。写完之后我意识到它只是一个男人的自怜和矫饰，单独拿出来，最起码对我来说我是没办法接受的，是不成立的。最后我发现我要从他女儿的角度去重新写整个故事。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;别的很多小说也可能是由梦来的？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;宥予：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;醒来后稍微记一下的很多，但是写出来的只有这一个，因为现在精力不够，要写的东西非常多。今年下半年要写一个长篇，这篇好多人物从去年年底开始，不断地在我脑子里蹦出来，时不时我就看到他们在那待着，他们在想什么、在挣扎什么、在说什么话。偶尔还会冒出来一个新人物，他可能稍微说一句话，我一下子就看到他的童年，他的整个路径。我在写其他小说的时候他们还在冒，它是发生在2022年下半年的故事，也很近。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;有受到现实生活的启发吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;宥予：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;会有。但我不会直接写很多大事，我在处理很多中短篇的时候也这样，我觉得直接写这个事没意思，我还是喜欢写一个事件可能过去很久了，但是在某个人整个生命中是怎么起作用的。就好像在水面上每扔一块石头进去，水波兴起之后，水波消散，那这个水面还是原来那个水面吗？那个波痕到底留下了什么？我还是更有兴趣去挖掘这些东西。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;当事学生韩永（化名）表示，公示时间为9月20日至29日，而他们于28日下午也就是公示期结束的前一天，才被告知“保研资格被取消”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“保研事故”“保研资格被取消”，成了这起事件的热搜标题。但这起事件仍然存在诸多需要厘清的事实细节，不能简单地归之为“事故”乃至“黑幕”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;保研中的“推荐免试”与“成功录取”是两个完全不同的概念，这一点在媒体报道中被有意无意地模糊化，也让事件的走向有些失焦。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通常而言，寻求保研的大四学生需要先争取本校推免资格，然后才能申请本校或是外校的预录取资格。同时，保研在录取方式上尚有“夏令营”“预推免”“九推”（九月推免）的分野，在接收单位上也有“内保”（本校）与“外推”（他校）的区别。夏令营与预推免的优先级比“九推”为高，“内保”的把握又要比“外推”更大，这些都是“保研界”里的细分赛道，每个赛道的游戏规则也有所不同，并不能一概而论。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这起“保研事故”中，“被取消资格”的学生参加的就是简称为“九推”的“九月推免”。根据西北师大官网9月16日发布的《关于做好2024年推荐优秀应届本科毕业生免试攻读硕士研究生工作的通知》，此次推免工作的时间表是“9月17日学生申请，9月17-20日学院推荐，9月20日学校审核”，然后就是“9月20日至29日，学校对拟推荐名单进行公示，公示期10天”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除普通推免之外，西北师大9月16日的通知还公布了此次“九月推免”的其他种类，比如“本硕一体化”专项、“辅导员”专项计划、“农村学校教育硕士师资培养计划”专项(简称“农硕”)、“研究生支教团”专项等推免招生计划。其中“辅导员专项”推荐工作由党委学生工作部负责，属于“高校行政保研”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据《纵览新闻》引述当事学生小红（化名）的说法，此次“事故”影响的学生有一百余名，他们主要申请的是“本硕一体化卓越中学教师”与“辅导员专项”两个推免项目。中新网的报道也显示，两名受访学生都是申请了“辅导员专项”然后被取消资格的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通知显示，“辅导员专项”由党委学工部负责推荐，学制为“1+基本学制”，大四毕业后要先专职辅导员一年；“本硕一体化”的选拔工作则限定了学院与接收专业、需要签订培养协议书，学制是“3+1+2”，也就是本科三年、过渡一年，教育硕士两年。至少从这份文件的字面意思来看，校方对这两个内部保研项目的招生录取工作，都有着较大的裁量权与决定权。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;问题推到这一步，根据已有的信息，不难得出学校确实存在失误的可能，也就是学校工作人员“手滑”，让两个“本校内部保研”项目的推免研究生公示人数超过了推免计划名额，造成名额超额。关键在于，被取消资格的保研项目，其计划名额是怎么算出来的、是否包括在总名额里，学校又是否有权取消。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“博雅数据库”刊登的一份西北师大于9月16日发布的《2024届优秀应届本科毕业生推荐免试攻读硕士生名额分配表》显示，西北师大“2024届保研名额702人，较上届（641人）明显增加”，其中“辅导员专项”拟录取35人、“本硕一体化专项”则有100人之多。而这702人并不包括“辅导员专项”。是否可以说，“辅导员专项”本身就有些“编外”性质，所以校方有权机动处理？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“辅导员专项”与“本硕一体化”去年的名额分别是40人与60人。可见，今年“辅导员专项”的名额减少而“本硕一体化”的名额增加。在“事故”发生之后，赵琴（化名）接受中新网采访说“取消资格的是中间部分”，因为“农硕已经签约，木已成舟，只能取消我们的”。韩永也表示“我们学院所有辅导员专项保研的都被取消了资格”。这个细节也显示，“辅导员专项”的签约时间与正式入学都要更晚一些。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“公示人员超额”的失误究竟发生在哪一个时间节点？为何出现了人员超额的情况？受影响的两个保研项目人员名额，又是依据什么被判定为“超额”的？超额的项目只有“辅导员专项”“本硕一体化”吗？又或者说，校方确实对两个“本校内部保研”项目拥有较大的裁量权，有权在名单公示期取消变更招生计划？这些疑问的答案，都将决定“事故”的性质究竟只是工作上的失误，还是程序上的失信。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，校方应详细解答“发现人数超额”的具体细节，向外界公布此次受影响的几个“本校保研”项目的具体规则。这样，到底是失误还是失信，就一目了然了。 &lt;/p>;
