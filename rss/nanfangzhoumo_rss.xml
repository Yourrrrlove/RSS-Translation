(hereinafter referred to as Yedu) limits the reception time to once a week, and each visitor is 300 Yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This small real estate company rooted in Qingfeng County, Puyang City received more than 300 groups of visitors in 2022. Not only real estate peers, but also various companies such as medical, education, catering, etc. came in droves, calling it &quot;the fattest company in the real estate industry&quot;. Come east&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like the legendary Pang Donglai in the supermarket industry, Yedu also strives to provide products and services that exceed first-tier standards. In the buildings it builds, a gym and a reading room are standard features. The community trash cans are cleaned three times a day, and the sewers in the employee cafeteria are washed twice a day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Yedu only started engaging in real estate development in 2010, and only developed 6 properties in 10 years, all located in Qingfeng County. This county in northeastern Henan has a total population of 750,000. The county’s GDP in 2022 is 23.77 billion yuan, which is only about half of Henan Construction Real Estate’s 2021 revenue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;170 kilometers south of Qingfeng County, Henan Jinsha Real Estate Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Jinsha) in Shangqiu City also received a large number of visitors. At the end of October 2023, a real estate consulting agency in Beijing regarded Sands as a benchmark real estate company and organized more than 40 real estate company executives from 12 provinces to visit and exchange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The size of Jinsha is not large. The company has developed 40 properties in the past 16 years, distributed in 8 counties and cities in Shangqiu. The GDP of this eastern Henan city in 2022 ranks 7th among the 18 cities in Henan, just exceeding 300 billion yuan, less than 1/4 of Zhengzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in a county where the average price is more than 5,000 yuan, real estate in Jinsha has been sold for more than 10,000 yuan. The community property also provides wedding services, free physical examinations, etc. to the owners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many senior practitioners in the Henan real estate industry told Southern Weekend reporters that in fact, before 2021, the local real estate circle paid little attention to county real estate companies such as Yedu and Jinsha. “At this stage, everyone is thinking that the future development direction of real estate may be to produce products and services.” One of them said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Luxury homes&quot; in the county&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2018, Yedu delivered its second property in Qingfeng County. This property has a light yellow facade and a European-style door that stands out in the county. It was the previous year that Yedu proposed the concept of &quot;refinement&quot; and the company&#39;s headquarters was built next to this building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of October 2023, Yedu will deliver its seventh project. Sun Chaoyang, a company executive who has been with the company for more than ten years, told Southern Weekend reporters that the company spent four months on the facade in order to make it look better. &quot;The colors and lines were adjusted over and over again, which made several paint suppliers lose their temper.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a community that has been delivered, the green trees downstairs were trimmed into a spherical shape. A staff member told the Southern Weekend reporter with a Henan accent that this was improved after the company returned from studying in Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The cleaning staff in the community immediately stopped the broom in their hands when they saw the visitors, smiled and said hello, with makeup still on their young faces. According to work requirements, she has to use a high-pressure water gun to clean every trash can in the community from the inside out three times a day. Yedu&#39;s recruitment requirements for cleaners are under 45 years old, and the monthly salary is more than 5,000 yuan, which is double the county average. According to Anjuke, the average price of properties currently on sale in Yedu is about 5,000 yuan per square meter, which is generally 700 to 800 yuan higher than the price of houses in the same area. Especially in the base camp of Qingfeng County, where the average price of new houses is only about 3,000 yuan, Yedu can be called a &quot;luxury house&quot; in the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jinsha said in a recent official WeChat push that &quot;7 rare pine trees&quot; were transplanted at the entrance of one of its properties in Xiayi County, Shangqiu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters consulted in the name of home buyers. Sands Real Estate consultants said that the prices of real estate developed by the company are generally higher than those of regional projects, and the average price of high-end projects can reach 15,000/square meter. According to Anjuke data, this price is 10,000 yuan/square meter higher than the average price of new homes in Shangqiu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The one who shouted the slogan of &quot;refinement&quot; earlier was Yongwei Real Estate Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Yongwei). Yongwei Real Estate was established in Zhengzhou, Henan in 2005. There was a jingle circulating in the Henan real estate circle: &quot;Yongwei has three treasures: good building materials, landscape and properties.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jinsha directly used Yongwei&#39;s jingle. A person in charge of Yongwei told a Southern Weekend reporter that in order to learn from Yongwei, Sands founder Yang Limin even bought a house in a property developed by Yongwei. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song Yanqing, president of Rand Consulting Company, has been engaged in real estate consulting and investment for more than 20 years. He explained to Southern Weekend reporters that refinement means controlling quality during the construction process. Assume that there are three seams on the floor, wall, and ceiling. Fine construction must ensure that the three seams are aligned to avoid misaligned seams and damage to the aesthetics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He introduced that as early as 2013, major real estate companies had proposed the concept of refinement. However, the real estate market has developed rapidly, high leverage and high turnover models have become popular, and scale has replaced quality as a more important indicator. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yongwei has taken a refined route since 2007, with Zhengzhou as its base camp, and has developed a total of 36 projects. Its high-end projects in Beilong Lake, Zhengzhou, have an average price of more than 60,000 yuan per square meter and are well-known local luxury properties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the beginning, Yongwei also learned from his peers. Zhang Yingqian, who is responsible for brand marketing at Kangqiao Real Estate, a local real estate company in Zhengzhou, told Southern Weekend reporters that Kangqiao relies on quality to build its reputation. The upstart Yongwei once poached a team of dozens of people from Kangqiao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Yingqian has been in the industry for more than ten years. She said that at the beginning of development, major real estate companies competed on quality and built benchmark projects at all costs. &quot;From 0 to 1, we mainly rely on products, so we all take the refined route, because we can only obtain the first batch of seed customers through products.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Especially in the Henan real estate market, because real estate companies With large quantities, competition for quality is even fiercer. Data from the China Real Estate Association shows that the number of real estate companies in Henan will exceed 8,000 in 2022, ranking fourth in the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After rapid development, Zhengzhou real estate companies have passed the primitive accumulation stage, while county real estate companies are experiencing a breakthrough from 0 to 1. The quality competition that once occurred in the Zhengzhou market is now being staged again in the county. Zhang Yingqian revealed that in the past two years, Sands has poached marketing, engineering, design and other managers from Kangqiao Real Estate with high salaries. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Lessons from High Leverage&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Spurred by the housing reform policy, Henan’s real estate market also began to take off around 2016. According to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, the sales area of ​​commercial housing in Zhengzhou exceeded 30 million square meters in 2016, more than double the previous year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It’s just like picking up money.” Wang Zhixing, who is responsible for brand planning in Yedu, told Southern Weekend reporters. At that time, he was working as a sales agent for new houses in Anyang City. He often closed the houses as soon as they were launched. Sales were so hot that he didn&#39;t even need a sales department. He just started selling houses with an advertising slogan. The quality of each property is not compared, but location and price are more important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More foreign real estate companies are also entering Henan. Following Evergrande and Country Garden, large-scale real estate companies such as Sunac, Jinke, and Blu-ray successively entered Henan around 2016 to capture land. Local real estate companies are lining up to go public, and CCRE is gradually moving down, covering more than 100 county-level cities in Henan by 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Chaoyang also recalled that the county market was also booming at that time. &quot;As long as you get the land in your hands, you don&#39;t have to pay attention to any products, you can sell it quickly and get money back quickly.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Yedu slowed down its land acquisition. At that time, the company wanted to be &quot;slower and more stable.&quot; , which is related to the setbacks encountered at the beginning of starting a business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yedu first got involved in real estate in 2010. The founder, Cheng Xiaofeng, made his first pot of gold through steel trading. His father worked for Anyang Iron and Steel Group and took him from his hometown of Anyang to Qingfeng County, Puyang next door. a piece of land. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cheng Xiaofeng, who was born in 1980, entered the society as a teenager. In his early years, he worked as a chef and drove a truck. After attracting attention in Yedu, he rarely appeared in public. He has stayed in the company for a long time and knows almost every employee. He often tells the story of his entrepreneurial days in the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, the threshold for investing in real estate in Anyang and Puyang was not high. Wang Zhixing entered the industry in 2011. He remembers that he only had to pay a deposit of 10% of the land price to obtain land. The first project he sold as an agent covered an area of ​​70 acres, and he only paid 2.1 million yuan to start development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Chaoyang said that when developing the first real estate, the company had little own funds and mainly relied on external borrowings from banks and individuals. Due to lack of development experience, the project lost more than 100 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Phoenix Weekly, a private fund-raising collapse occurred in Anyang in 2012. Since the local boom in private lending in 2009, more than 300 high-interest savings companies have been created, and at least more than 20 billion in funds have been involved, flowing into real estate, energy and other fields. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A local real estate company executive recalled that Anyang’s fundraising had a great impact on the financial environment of the entire region. Banks began to withdraw loans and personal loans were required to be returned in advance. Yedu was also affected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So starting from the second project, Yedu no longer relied on external financing. &quot;I just think I can&#39;t make quick money.&quot; Sun Chaoyang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, under the market conditions at that time, land prices continued to be pushed up. By 2018, one acre of land in Puyang soared to 1.8 million yuan, and Yedu, which only relied on its own funds, had no advantage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another limitation was that Yedu did not have many employees at the time. County companies have difficulty recruiting people, and their personnel reserves are not enough to support company expansion. It was not until 2020 that Yedu had developed for 10 years and the number of employees had increased to about one hundred. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like Yedu, Jinsha did not make many moves when the market was booming in the past few years. Practitioners in the Zhengzhou real estate circle know very little about it. One of the senior practitioners concluded that due to capital and personnel constraints, it is difficult for county real estate companies to compete with large real estate companies during their rapid growth. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Developing against the trend&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;What is unique about Henan is that the county market still leaves room for survival for local small real estate companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data released by the Henan Provincial Government show that the urbanization rate of Henan&#39;s permanent population in 2022 is 57.07%, which is 8.15 percentage points lower than the national average. Data from the Qingfeng County Bureau of Statistics show that the local urbanization rate in 2022 is only 35.12%&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;National real estate companies also entered the county market during large-scale expansion, which once had an impact on local small real estate companies. Sun Chaoyang introduced that around 2018, Country Garden, Jianye, etc. successively entered Qingfeng County. Under the impact, Yedu’s sales fell by 20%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, with low housing prices and limited profit margins in the county, it is not a key market for large real estate companies. In addition, the company is large and its management radius is difficult to reach the county seat. After several years of development, Country Garden has only developed two properties in Qingfeng County, while Jianye has cooperated with local developers to develop in an asset-light manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For small real estate companies that have taken root in the county, this low-profit market is a place to settle down. Sun Chaoyang believes that the demand for home purchases in the regional market still exists, especially as part of the investment demand has been converted into demand for second home purchases. Through intensive cultivation and improving quality while controlling costs, county real estate companies have made profits from this customer group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2020, under the control of real estate policies such as the &quot;Three Red Lines&quot;, the credit environment has tightened. Coupled with the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the economic environment, the high-leverage and high-turnover model has been impacted, and large real estate companies that rely on this model to develop have experienced explosive growth. However, small real estate companies in the county have bucked the trend and developed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Chaoyang introduced that Yedu began to expand out of Qingfeng County in 2020, opening 11 new properties in three years, and increasing its employees by more than 300 people. During this period, the market was sluggish and land prices in the county fell. Yedu seized the opportunity to acquire more than 500 acres of land at once, saving more than 200 million in land costs compared with the high price period in 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ability to buck the trend and acquire land is due to the company’s low debt ratio. Yedu uses its own funds to develop projects and does not use bank loans. The current cash flow is sufficient to ensure the company&#39;s normal operation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The boss’s words are that we can stop doing nothing for half a year.” Wang Zhixing said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sands, which has also developed rapidly after 2020, also announced on its official WeChat account that the company’s debt ratio has remained at 5%-10% all year round. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/u4BoW0srd2cdubOGlD0MGp9PIheyOoeZb7GocKLC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1268&quot; height= &quot;908&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/u4BoW0srd2cdubOGlD0MGp9PIheyOoeZb7GocKLC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256135&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Yedu transformed the sales department into a life experience center, and learned that Fat Donglai opened a supermarket next to it. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Wei Lincong/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;How much money can you make selling steamed buns?&quot;&lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After establishing a foothold in the county, the desire for expansion also appears in small real estate companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the National Day holiday in 2023, Sands went to Zhengzhou to discuss cooperation with major developers, hoping to enter Zhengzhou and build a benchmark project in Beilong Lake, a luxury area. Zhang Yingqian participated in the meeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This path from product creation to scale expansion feels familiar to Zhang Yingqian. After Kangqiao Real Estate initially built its reputation on its products, financial institutions and consulting companies came to persuade the boss to learn the high-turnover model and expand its scale. Finally, around 2019, a branch was established in Shanghai and began to expand to the south. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the industry encountered a cold winter just after leaving Henan, and the expansion of Kangqiao Real Estate was hindered. Now, Zhang Yingqian saw in her circle of friends that the consulting company that had persuaded her boss to expand had gone to Jinsha for exchanges again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More and more people came to Yedu for cooperation. Some had money, some had land, and they were invited to Zhengzhou and Beijing with preferential terms. &quot;When the market is bad, there will be more (seeks for cooperation).&quot; Sun Chaoyang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Yedu did not agree. The company&#39;s current development plan still does not extend beyond the northern Henan region where Puyang is located. &quot;Everyone wants to go out, but we should recognize ourselves more clearly. We don&#39;t have the ability to go out now.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bigger problem is that the myth of scale created by the high-leverage and high-turnover model has been shattered. Where else can the company go? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despite its expansion against the trend, Yedu is inevitably affected by the market environment. Wang Zhixing said that the total monthly sales volume of the company&#39;s four properties in Qingfeng is only more than 100 units. In the past, one property could reach such a level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The solution Yedu came up with is to transform into services. In 2021, Cheng Xiaofeng proposed to open a pastry shop in the community to sell handmade steamed buns. The employees found it incredible, &quot;How much money can I make selling steamed buns?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the idea was implemented and expanded from the pastry shop to supermarkets, dry cleaning, housekeeping and other services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2023, Yedu opened a 500-square-meter supermarket next to its headquarters. Wang Zhixing introduced that the company spent more than one million yuan in 2022 just to learn how to open a supermarket. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pang Donglai, who also lives in Henan, is the key learning target. Yedu Supermarket is equipped with the same Dyson wash basin as Fat Donglai, which costs more than 20,000 yuan. It also provides tea, strollers, free charging and other services. The products are also self-produced just like Fat Donglai. The steamed buns, noodles and bean sprouts are even produced in-house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Supermarket staff told Southern Weekend reporters that the company plans to open three more supermarkets of the same size in Qingfeng County where there is a large flow of people, and smaller stores in residential areas. But the first store is not yet profitable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yedu’s idea is to provide supporting services for the entire chain of clothing, food, housing and transportation. In the future, it will also develop catering and open pharmacies. Not only for property owners, but also for people throughout the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The company hopes to regard service as its core profit point in the future, and real estate will only be incidental.” Sun Chaoyang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(At the request of the interviewee, Zhang Yingqian and Sun Chaoyang are pseudonyms)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br >;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/ a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[长相与年龄不符意味着什么？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259588]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-31 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;People are growing older all the time, but their appearance does not necessarily keep pace with their age. When the appearance does not match the age and clearly looks older or younger than the actual age, different people will have different explanations for this. Especially if you look older than your actual age, it is often interpreted as premature aging. In fact, many scientific studies support the reasoning that there are actually signs of aging. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A long-term follow-up heart study in Copenhagen found that gray hair, facial wrinkles and male baldness are several obvious signs of aging, which may indicate that people have a higher risk of myocardial infarction, especially People with much longer gray hair have a significantly higher risk than those without gray hair. In addition to these specific external characteristics, the general feeling of &quot;looking older&quot; also has reference significance for assessing health risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not easy to guess a person’s age based on visual information alone due to the interference of external factors such as clothing and grooming. In 2016, researchers from the Institute of Public Health at the University of Southern Denmark conducted a comparative study on nearly two hundred groups of identical twins and found that even if twins have the same genes and very similar looks, people can still tell the difference between their faces. Read the clues to aging too quickly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These elderly twins were over 70 years old as early as 2001. Researchers asked people to guess the age of the elderly people through their ID photos. The results found that whether it was changing their faces or dressing up, it would affect the age of the elderly people. People&#39;s perceptions of the age of the elderly. Statistics more than a decade later also show that the older twin is more likely to die earlier. Facial cues become a predictor of risk of survival or death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although many studies have discovered some health secrets hidden behind the face, there are not many studies that systematically analyze the relationship between appearance and aging. In order to clarify what it means to look inconsistent with age, in March 2023, researchers from Erasmus University in the Netherlands and other institutions tried to investigate how people&#39;s perceived age is related to a series of aging by analyzing more data. relationship between diseases. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Look younger and healthier&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As expected, the results were as expected. Corresponding to the higher risk of older-looking people, those who looked younger than they actually were Younger people, who are at lower risk for many age-related diseases, also have better cognitive function overall. Relevant research was published in the British Journal of Dermatology, providing a certain reference for scientific face reading. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The phenomenon of appearance and age inconsistency is very common in daily life. In order to understand this phenomenon more scientifically and deeply, we must first distinguish three concepts about age. In addition to sensory age, which can be assessed by people&#39;s appearance alone, chronological age and physiological age are also more valuable references for health and aging. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Daniel W. Belsky, an associate professor at Columbia University School of Public Health who has long studied aging issues, told Southern Weekend reporters, “Actual age measures the time since birth, while physiological age It is a measure of health. A physiological age value can be understood as a person&#39;s typical health status at this actual age.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, according to the normal aging rate, a person in good health will Their biological age should be close to or even consistent with their actual age. But in reality, some people&#39;s biological age will deviate significantly from their actual age, showing an atypical health state. Among them, if the biological age is younger than the actual age, it means that the overall health status is better than that of the average person of the same age, while the biological age is greater than the actual age, the degree of aging is deeper. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The analysis of sensory age in the latest research actually explores the possibility of identifying aging through a simple way of vision, and the results show that looking younger is indeed associated with a higher risk of various diseases. lower. Specifically, looking five years younger than your actual age has a significantly lower risk of osteoporosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cataracts, and hearing loss, as well as better cognitive performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These results are based on the analysis of health data of more than 2,600 European middle-aged and elderly people. It is worth noting that the age distribution of the people included in the study ranges from their fifties to their eighties and are in the process of age-related diseases. Significantly elevated stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Young people’s bodies are not necessarily young&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Although current relevant research focuses on middle-aged and elderly people, it does not mean that the rhythm of maturity and aging is only in It starts to accelerate suddenly after entering middle age. There is evidence that among young people in their twenties and thirties, as their chronological age steadily increases, the gap in their biological ages begins to appear. Looking at specific manifestations, people who age faster have poorer physical abilities, cognitive decline, and brain aging. These people often feel that their health is getting worse and they look older. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relevant research was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) in 2015. What&#39;s even more cruel is that these observed aging gaps occur between the ages of 26 and 38. The same 38-year-old is not yet middle-aged, but the physiological age of different people is obviously different. Daniel Belsky, now an associate professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Center for Aging Research at Columbia University, was involved in the study. Over a period of nearly 12 years, researchers recorded changes in a range of physiological indicators in nearly a thousand participants. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Aging is a process that begins early in life. We can see signs of it in healthy young people, and some people age faster than others already at a young age. Therefore, maintaining a healthy lifestyle and seeking an environment with clean air and water are safe and reliable, and creating opportunities to participate in social interactions is also a priority.&quot; Daniel Belsky told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;In some aspects , this is all self-evident. But it is important to realize that even in youth, which we tend to think of as indestructible, our lifestyle and environment can influence the trajectory of our aging, with long-lasting consequences.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;At present, it is not easy to study aging, because compared with the life span of animals such as mice, which can be quickly observed in animal studies, the time span from birth to death in humans is much longer. After entering middle-aged and old age, the increase in age-related diseases makes it easier to observe people&#39;s aging. Relatively speaking, the signs of aging in young people are less easy to detect. However, when it comes to delaying aging, young people actually have more time and opportunities to make changes to improve their own health. Therefore, identifying the signs of aging as early as possible and understanding the laws of aging are of great significance to alleviating the pressure on global public health in the context of aging. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Perceiving the Signs of Aging Early&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“I’m not sure individuals really need to measure their biological age.” explains Daniel Belsky, Popular Aging needs to be measured in medical research, not only to identify factors that accelerate or delay aging, but also to evaluate the effectiveness of some anti-aging projects, policies, life interventions and drug therapies. &quot;However, for those who do want to know more about their aging and health, there are a range of tools on the market that can help estimate biological age, from blood tests to DNA tests. These tests themselves are not dangerous, but the results should Interpret with caution, and it is best to interpret relevant results with the help of healthcare professionals.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2023, a research report published in &quot;The Lancet Healthy Longevity&quot; It shows that chest X-ray examination, an already widely used technology, may be used to assist in the assessment of human aging. By training and developing related artificial intelligence models, the researchers used chest radiographs to estimate the age of the client. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The results show that for relatively healthy people, the age estimated by artificial intelligence through chest X-rays has a strong correlation with the actual age. But for people with pre-existing medical conditions, the difference between estimated and actual age is associated with multiple chronic conditions, identifying increased risk for hypertension, interstitial lung disease, chronic renal failure, and more. This means that common picture information such as chest X-rays may become an aging biomarker to help people evaluate the status of chronic diseases and even predict life span, while improving the level of personalized intervention and treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with these methods that rely on medical equipment, looking at faces directly and roughly assessing aging and related health risks based on whether appearance matches age is obviously more concise, although the accuracy is limited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it should be noted that, including looking at faces to assess sensory age, many relevant studies currently include thousands of samples, but the sources are relatively single and lack sufficient representation. Differences actually play an important role in sensory age assessment, which is also an obvious limitation of related research so far. Whether the health implications of appearance and age mismatch are effective in all types of communities remains to be confirmed by more research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Comparative studies on skin aging have long found that the skin aging trajectories of Asians and Europeans are very different. Taking Chinese and French women as an example, a small sample study shows that Chinese women start to develop wrinkles on their faces almost ten years later than French women. This time difference will make Chinese women look significantly younger at this time, but by the age of four In their teens, Chinese women will experience rapid aging in terms of facial wrinkles, showing a non-linear trend. In comparison, French women&#39;s aging in this aspect is relatively stable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such as this, due to the differences in facial development between different races, the accuracy of applying the sensory experience of one group to predict the age of people in another group will be relatively limited. In addition, there are cultural differences in how people dress in different societies. If we understand the phenomenon of appearance and age mismatch in a cross-cultural context, we may find different rules. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Efforts to delay aging&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In fact, when it comes to looking at faces, whether appearance matches age is only one aspect. In 2022, biological research also found that there may be a connection between physical attractiveness and health indicators such as immune function. After a series of experiments and tests, researchers found that people who were more physically attractive also had better immune performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Summer Mengelkoch, an experimental social psychology researcher at Texas Christian University who participated in this study, told Southern Weekend reporters that although a person who cares too much about physical attractiveness may appear They are very superficial, but their research shows that when people pay attention to the physical attractiveness of their partners, they may actually care about more than just looks, and may also use this to select a healthy partner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The latest research starts from the gap between sensory age and actual age, providing more evidence for scientific face reading. By identifying the signs and risk factors of aging as early as possible, you can take action to slow down aging. In May 2023, researchers from Harvard Medical School found in studies on mice and humans that physiological age will fluctuate in both directions under the influence of stress. When stress is excessive, physiological age will increase, and after recovery from stress, physiological age will increase. Age will reverse repair. This may provide a suitable entry point for future interventions targeting aging. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Whether we are middle-aged or still young. To promote healthy aging, the things we can do are actually the same. Eat a healthy diet, do a lot of physical activities, and participate in family activities. , socializing with friends and community, cultivating a sense of purpose and meaning, and avoiding toxic stress and pollution.&quot; Daniel Belsky emphasized to Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;The scientific community is now developing new drugs that can slow down physiological aging and extend the healthy life cycle. At the same time, we already know how to promote healthy aging by changing the environment in which we live—reducing pollution, ensuring safe and secure housing, and providing affordable and healthy food. We should invest in these areas as well. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[从魂魄、中阴身到幽灵Vs魔鬼：万圣节话中西之鬼异同]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259582]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-31 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Every year before Halloween comes, all kinds of creative and scary costumes bloom everywhere, and you can constantly watch short videos. Although today&#39;s Halloween is no different from &quot;Cosplay Festival&quot;. But its original &quot;ghost-driving&quot; element is still vaguely visible - even though in modern society, ghosts and gods have long become the objects of ridicule played by humans. However, various countries&#39; understanding of &quot;what is a ghost&quot; still follows thousands of years of tradition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a wonderful discussion and definition of &quot;what is a ghost&quot; in &quot;Book of Rites·Jiyi&quot;: &quot;Zaiwo said: I heard the names of ghosts and gods, but I don&#39;t know what they mean. The Master said: Qi is also , the prosperity of gods. The prosperity of souls, the prosperity of ghosts. The combination of ghosts and gods is the ultimate teaching. All living things must die, and after death they must return to the earth. This is called ghosts.&quot; Zaiwo didn&#39;t understand what ghosts and gods were, so Confucius told him: &quot; God is essence, and ghost is soul. All living things will die, and after death they will return to dust, which are called ghosts.&quot; - Confucius played a homophonic joke here: ghosts are all living things. ultimate destination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because of this, in China’s oldest traditions, ghosts and gods are often not clearly distinguished. As the saying goes, &quot;Ghosts are ancestors, and ancestors are also ghosts.&quot; The Confucian attitude towards ghosts and gods is also very interesting. Confucius once said: &quot;Respect ghosts and gods and keep them at a distance.&quot; He also said: &quot;If you can&#39;t serve people, how can you serve ghosts?&quot; In short, he tried his best to avoid the issue of ghosts and gods, and even showed an agnostic tendency to a certain extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, Confucianism places great emphasis on respecting ancestors and offering sacrifices on time. If ghosts and gods do not exist at all, then what are they worshiping? Confucius added another patch to this: &quot;Sacrifice to the gods as if they were present, and sacrifice to the gods as if the gods were present. Confucius said: If I don&#39;t offer sacrifices, it would be as if I didn&#39;t offer sacrifices.&quot; In other words, when offering sacrifices to ancestors, it seems as if the ancestors are really in front of you; when offering sacrifices to gods, It was as if God was really in front of me. Confucius also said that if I do not personally participate in the sacrifice, the sacrifice will be the same as no sacrifice. From this, it can be seen that Confucius emphasized that those who participate in the sacrifice should have pious emotions in their hearts. According to Confucianism, sacrifice is a moral ritual used to unite the community, rather than a religious ritual used to pray for blessings and ward off disasters. Therefore, salutes are just out of recalling the feelings of ancestors. As the saying goes, &quot;sages teach with Shinto.&quot; And the sacrifices are mainly for the living people to see: &quot;Be careful and pursue the long distance, and the people&#39;s virtue will be strong.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From today&#39;s perspective, Confucius&#39;s view is very advanced. However, on the other hand, it seems to be contradictory to avoid the issue of ghosts and gods while requiring people to worship sincerely. Mohism, the lifelong enemy of Confucianism, once seized this point and vigorously ridiculed Confucianism. Contrary to Confucianism, Mohism strives to prove the real existence of ghosts and gods, so it regards sacrifice as more important than Confucianism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for Taoism, the attitude is more distinct than that of Confucianism. It is believed that after death, one returns to heaven and earth, and there is no such thing as ghosts and gods. Therefore, &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; sings with drums and pots, and &quot;Liehzi&quot; believes that death means eternal rest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, when Mozi argued that &quot;the ghosts and gods must be solemnly sacrificed&quot;, he also exposed his true thoughts: &quot;Although the ghosts and gods are asked to die, this can still bring joy to the crowd and get relatives in the hometown&quot;—— &quot;Even if there are really no ghosts and gods, we can still connect with the villagers through ritual gatherings.&quot; This is the same as Confucianism, which shows that Mozi&#39;s own belief was not so firm. After all, it is hard to imagine that monotheistic believers would say, &quot;Even if there is really no God, belief in God can have the following benefits...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even the Mohist school, which emphasizes ghosts and gods the most among the local schools, has this kind of attitude towards the existence of ghosts and gods. Attitude, it is not difficult to understand why the early setting of the underworld in Chinese mythology is so monotonous. Before the introduction and prosperity of Buddhism, although China had the concept of the underworld, it was still very simple: the underworld is the destination of the soul and is controlled by the Lord Taishan, but there is no such thing as hell; and although the story of reincarnation appeared very early, it is not It is regarded as a fixed procedure in the underworld, and is just an anecdote similar to &quot;seizing the body&quot; in later generations. Therefore, there is no concept of reincarnation and rebirth. For the ancients, death still means eternal separation and tranquility. As the saying goes, &quot;What is the way to die? The body is supported by the same mountain.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Going to hell after death is also the oldest view of life and death in China. It is still used as a euphemism for death to this day. There is also a famous story here, where Zheng Zhuanggong dug into the ground to meet his mother:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Zheng Zhuanggong decided that his younger brother had rebelled, he was very angry with his mother Wu Jiang who favored his younger brother. He put Wu Jiang under house arrest in Yingdi, and swore a poisonous oath: &quot;It&#39;s not as good as Huangquan, and we won&#39;t see each other again.&quot; This means we won&#39;t see each other until we die. As a result, Ying Kaoshu, an official of Yingdi, successfully persuaded Duke Zhuang of Zheng and aroused his family affection and filial piety. But Duke Zhuang still used the oath of poison as an excuse, so Uncle Yingkao said: &quot;This is easy to do. We can dig tunnels until the yellow spring water is dug out, and build an underground courtyard there. Can&#39;t you guys meet?&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;So Zhuang Gong, mother and son were able to meet in the tunnel. They hugged each other and cried, and reconciled as before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people were speechless when they first read this paragraph: they reconciled as before, but the problem is that Zheng Zhuanggong and his mother didn&#39;t like each other at first... And the Yellow Spring is really a yellow spring? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, Huangquan Temple comes from burial. After death, people go underground, not just Huangquan. Most scholars believe that the original meaning of Huangquan is underground water, because many three-generation ancient tombs are located below the water level. When Buddhism brought reincarnation in, it combined with the view of Huangquan to create &quot;Hell&quot; (Naluka) - the Indian native &quot;Naluka&quot;, which is more similar to a parallel universe or an alien space. After death, people will enter this Space is judged; but Chinese tradition believes that after death, people must go underground. Therefore, the Buddhists had no choice but to move &quot;Naluojia&quot; underground, which gave it the name &quot;Hell&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reincarnation of Buddhism is inherited from the traditional setting of Hinduism. There are actually similar theories all over the world. For example, the ancient Greek philosopher Plato often mentioned reincarnation in his books. But for most civilizations, this theory is just an anecdote, not a universally accepted assumption. Only in South Asia, reincarnation is the axiomatic basis of all religions and philosophies. Even the reason why the Buddha became a monk was to find the right path to escape the suffering of reincarnation. Buddhism believes that if all living beings are freed from reincarnation, it means the end of all &quot;suffering&quot;. This is what Buddhism says &quot;all living beings are suffering&quot;. Beings who are not in the &quot;reincarnation&quot; are no longer sentient beings, but Buddhas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the Buddhist theory of reincarnation is obviously in conflict with China’s native sacrifices. In order to solve this conflict, there are various patches, such as &quot;Ghosts queue up in the underworld to be reincarnated, and they have to live during the lottery.&quot; This &quot;lottery&quot; state between two reincarnations and two deaths is called the &quot;bardo&quot; in Buddhism. But this patch is still incomplete - the emperor wants to offer sacrifices to his ancestors. Is it because the ancestors have waited hundreds of years and still not passed away? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So after Taoism absorbed the concept of reincarnation, it added another patch: humans have three souls and seven souls, and the three souls are the heaven soul, the earth soul, and the life soul. What dissipates after death is not the soul, but the soul. The three souls reincarnate after death, the heavenly soul goes to heaven, and the earthly soul lives in the ancestral hall or tomb. Therefore, before a person&#39;s life soul is reincarnated, all the money burned is for the life soul. The soul of life is reincarnated, and what is burned is for the soul of earth. Different Taoist schools have different patch theories. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in modern times, Christianity has brought heaven into the world, and the situation has become even more confusing: After death, a person can enjoy the sacrifices of his descendants in the underworld and enter the six realms of reincarnation. Can he also watch his descendants in heaven at the same time? Some people have tried to reconcile this: after death, people enter Hades to be judged. After the verdict, the guilty go to reincarnation or hell, and the innocent ascend to heaven where they are, and accept sacrifices, perfect. In fact, these are not important, because the Chinese people&#39;s attitude towards life and death still comes from Confucianism: everything is a moral ceremony rather than a religious ceremony, and everything is to comfort the living. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the Christian attitude towards ghosts, it is also very interesting to study in detail: the devil (Satan, the devil) or demons (that is, the fallen angels who follow the devil) we often call, although they are translated as &quot;ghosts&quot;, But it is not the same thing as Chinese ghosts. The ghost that the Chinese talk about is closer to the ghost that the Europeans talk about. According to the Bible, after death, the soul will sleep with the body, waiting for the arrival of judgment and resurrection in the last days. People who belong to Christ will go to the Kingdom of God after death, which the Bible calls the new heaven and new earth; people who do not belong to Christ will go to the Kingdom of God after death. Imprisoned in Hades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, Christianity believes that ghost phenomena in the world are all illusions made by Satan, and there are no ghosts in the world at all. Some Christians believe in the existence of ghosts, but are opposed to any form of communication with them because the Old Testament repeatedly warns against ghost communication rituals. Therefore, we can see that ghosts rarely appear in European and American ghost films. Vampires, werewolves, and cursed children are the common protagonists - but even these ghosts are also opposed by Christianity. Therefore, every year on Halloween, there are still Christian churches in Europe and the United States advocating a boycott and advocating that if children come to ask for candy, they can be given a Bible or a cross as a gift. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 10:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[海关总署：11月1日起出入境人员免于填报健康申明卡]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259653]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-31 10:42:24&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In accordance with the relevant provisions of the &quot;Frontier Health and Quarantine Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; and its implementation rules, the General Administration of Customs decided to Starting from 0:00 on November 1, 2023, entry and exit personnel are exempted from filling in the &quot;People&#39;s Republic of China Entry/Exit Health Declaration Card&quot;, but they have infectious diseases such as fever, cough, difficulty breathing, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and unexplained subcutaneous bleeding.

In terms of net profit alone, the four major state-owned banks have surpassed their international peers: in the first half of 2023, the total exceeded 603.5 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than twenty years ago, the four major banks fell into &quot;technical bankruptcy.&quot; After China&#39;s accession to the WTO, the country&#39;s door opened wide, and foreign banks entered China frequently, and since 2006 they have enjoyed national treatment. Observers and the industry have been crying wolf for this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2003, China Construction Bank and Bank of China were designated by the State Council as pilot projects for the shareholding reform of wholly state-owned banks, and were expected to &quot;transform into internationally competitive modern joint-stock commercial banks in about three years.&quot; After unprecedented financial restructuring and the introduction of international strategic investment, China Construction Bank and Bank of China were listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2005 and 2006 respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This move has clarified a replicable path for the shareholding reform and listing of ICBC, Agricultural Bank of China and Postal Savings Bank of China. As Jiang Jianqing, the then chairman of ICBC, said, the joint-stock reform is a glorious prelude to the reform of my country&#39;s state-owned banks. It is also a desperate battle with no retreat and a reform that cannot afford to lose. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the glorious prologue, strengthening corporate governance is an important task. Under layer upon layer supervision, the four major industries are moving inwards and innovating continuously. A clean financial statement trusted by global investors is an example of 20 years of practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, and Ernst &amp; Young are the four internationally renowned accounting firms (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Big Four&quot;). Among them, Deloitte China Vice Chairman Wu Weijun has served as the Bank of China and China Postal Savings The signing accountant for the stock reform and listing of banks. The former is the pilot stock reform and listing of China&#39;s state-owned banks, and the latter is the final project of the stock reform and listing of China&#39;s state-owned banks. He is praised by the financial industry for participating in and leading the design of a &quot;bank reform roadmap&quot; suitable for China&#39;s national conditions, and providing technical guidance for promoting the reform of the four major state-owned commercial banks in the three areas of corporate governance, financial reporting and capital restructuring. He is also known as the accountant most familiar with China&#39;s state-owned banks, as he has served as the signing accountant for Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China and Postal Savings Bank of China. Today, he has served as the signing accountant for the annual report of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China for three consecutive years. As early as more than 20 years ago, he served as a partner of the &quot;Big Four&quot; accounting firms, actively promoted the implementation of the localization transformation plan of the &quot;Big Four&quot; accounting firms, and has been committed to playing the role of auditors as &quot;gatekeepers&quot; in the capital market. &quot; value and have a &quot;capital eye&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a fellow traveler in the great era of China&#39;s banking reform and opening up, on the occasion of the 45th anniversary of China&#39;s financial reform and opening up, Wu Weijun repeatedly emphasized in an exclusive interview with Southern Weekend that the reform of China&#39;s four major state-owned commercial banks is a The results and historical significance of the arduous reform despite all difficulties are also remarkable. Today, the world is facing major changes unseen in a century, and China&#39;s financial industry will face huge historical challenges. At this important moment in the deepening and development of international and domestic finance, the presence of Chinese financial entrepreneurs is crucial. They will lead Chinese financial companies to shift from expanding externally to strengthening connotation with high quality. He personally is willing to continue to serve the development of the country&#39;s financial industry professionally. “It is the most glorious thing in my profession that the accounting statements I sign can be recognized by the international capital market and international supervision.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Weijun particularly emphasized the internationalization of talents. &quot;I suggest that Chinese enterprises comprehensively review the existing international talent training system and build an advanced international talent competency model.

He was not only the first Chinese partner of the &quot;Big Four&quot; accounting firms, but also the first to obtain the British Chartered Certified Accountant after 1949. Qualified Mainland Chinese. During his more than 30-year career, he has worked in mainland China, Hong Kong, New York, London and Sydney, and has participated in, promoted and witnessed many historic transformational events in the financial and accounting fields. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as 1993 to 1994, he assisted American expert Tom Macy in serving the People’s Bank of China’s Financial System Prudential Supervision Reform Consulting Project, introducing the most basic risks into the risk management of commercial banks. Evaluation method - five-level classification of loans, and establish an accounting system for the Chinese banking industry that can be basically understood and accepted by international organizations and global peers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When assessing the historical value and even the impact of these two events on today, he said, &quot;The impact of these two events cannot be overemphasized. The accounting system of commercial banks is in line with international standards and has provided international Investors and counterparties recognize our banks, and the Basel banking regulatory system accepts our banks, creating conditions for state-owned commercial banks to establish accounting controls, risk management and modern corporate governance systems. The five-level loan classification not only provides banks with It provides basic risk management tools, helps maintain asset quality, and also provides regulatory agencies with a regulatory grip for financial stability. This is the institutional foundation for modern financial development. It is important to realize that the institutional construction for the development of China&#39;s modern financial industry only takes 30 years In two years, we still have a lot to learn and improve.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, he experienced an unforgettable memory in his career - participating in and leading the design of the &quot;Bank Reform Roadmap.&quot; He commented on this, &quot;The reform of China&#39;s four major state-owned commercial banks is an arduous reform that overcomes all difficulties. But its results and historical significance are significant.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why can the reform persist and advance rapidly? Wu Weijun said, &quot;Supporting such a difficult banking reform to move forward is the determination of the central government&#39;s top management, as well as the professionalism and courage of the leaders at the executive level. At that time, I was the only one in the leadership team of the audit team who grew up in mainland China. . I very much want to carry out the reform of China’s banking industry and bring China’s state-owned banks into the ranks of the international banking industry. If the accounting statements I sign can be recognized by the international capital market and international supervision, it will be a great achievement in my major. The most glorious thing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He also participated in the formulation and implementation of the localization transformation plan of the &quot;Big Four&quot; accounting firms from 2010 to 2012. &quot;I value the inheritance of professionalism. Professionalism has two supporting points, one is moral integrity, and the other is professional service to the country, because the premise of professionalism is patriotism. Professionalism is the foundation of professionals.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He believes that in financial companies, the work of external auditors has special characteristics, that is, high-quality external audits are not only needed to protect the rights and interests of shareholders, but also to meet the regulatory compliance needs of domestic and foreign banks, and are also global financial and commodity trading counterparties. needs for party exposure risk management. The total on-balance sheet assets of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, where he serves as the signing accountant, exceed 40 trillion yuan. He told the team that they must make professional efforts to help ICBC increase its return on assets, even if it is only one ten thousandth. One ten thousandth of 40 trillion yuan in assets is 4 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only serving the banking industry, in important overseas capital markets, the &quot;Big Four&quot; members generally serve more than 70% of the listed companies. At present, China&#39;s capital market has become the second largest market in the world, but as of the end of October 2023, there were about 5,300 A-share listed companies, of which the number of companies with audit reports issued by the &quot;Big Four&quot; Chinese member firms only accounted for about 7%. Faced with such a gap, Wu Weijun believes that there is still much room for improvement in being a &quot;capital eye&quot;, which mainly includes clarifying the relationship between financial information preparers, auditors and regulators in the financial reporting chain and consolidating responsibilities; using large Data analysis and other technological means can improve the accuracy and effectiveness of audits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is generally believed that audit reports signed by the &quot;Big Four&quot; accounting firms, including Deloitte, are a passport to the international capital market.

In the early 1990s, China&#39;s economic system reform entered a new stage of transformation, starting from a &quot;planned economy as the mainstay, market regulation as a supplement&quot; to a &quot;socialist market economy&quot; system. In 1992, the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed the establishment of a socialist market economic system, and China&#39;s economic system began to undergo profound changes. How can international investors have enough confidence to enter China and understand China? The biggest difficulty in attracting foreign investment at that time was how to convince international investors that the Chinese government could truly embrace the market economy, follow international rules, and protect the legitimate rights and interests of investors during the transition from a planned economy to a market economy. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;During the state-owned bank reform period that began in 2003, state-owned banks What are the difficulties for commercial banks to attract foreign capital to invest in Chinese state-owned banks? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Weijun:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 2002, I served in the restructuring and share reform and listing of Bank of China Hong Kong. This project made me realize that the real stage for China’s financial system reform is in the mainland. After returning to Beijing, I served on the reform of the Bank of China. In 2005, Bank of China successively introduced international strategic investors—Royal Bank of Scotland, Temasek, UBS Group, and Asian Development Bank. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When state-owned commercial banks introduced international strategic investors in the early 21st century, the main focus of negotiations between China and foreign parties included the following aspects: first, whether they had consolidated their balance sheets; second, whether they had The ability to establish a corporate governance mechanism and operate it in accordance with the board of directors&#39; charter and rules of procedure; third, whether the risk management mechanism is effective in the long term. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Foreign capital entering China is attracted not only by the size of the Chinese economy and the market opportunities brought by its high growth, but also by its diligent and studious workers and its management that is willing to abide by international rules and cooperate with the international community. By. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The foundation of financial cooperation lies in the &quot;ability&quot; and &quot;willingness&quot; of the counterparty. For example, if you borrow money from someone else, what the person who lends you money cares most about is your ability to repay it? Are you willing to pay it back? Therefore, we cannot damage or lose the goodwill that has been established in the international capital market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Judging from the foreign-funded companies you have contacted, they are now investing in China What to expect from the environment? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Weijun: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Foreign capital enters China because they can make money in China. The basis for making money is not the absence of risks, but an understanding of risks and predictable returns. Only when the government&#39;s rules are transparent and things are done according to rules can capital flow more effectively. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The focus of the &quot;Big Four&quot; services in China is Support Chinese enterprises in reforming and entering international capital markets.

Talent is always the foundation of development strategy and the source of core competitiveness. Without international talents, it would be difficult for Chinese companies to &quot;go global&quot; and enter the international capital market, let alone the international integration of supply chains and the international integration of capital chains. I suggest that Chinese companies comprehensively examine the existing international talent training system, build an advanced international talent competency model, explore more effective talent training models in the digital economy era and the post-epidemic era, and let the international capital market better see that it is What kind of people are managing Chinese companies now? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bank of China and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China have opened operating institutions and outlets in more than 50 overseas countries and regions. They provide financial support for the integration of Chinese enterprises into the world economy. The overseas financial licenses and network resources of Bank of China and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China are important assets accumulated from the reform of China&#39;s financial industry. In the current international geopolitical environment, it is almost impossible for Chinese financial institutions to obtain financial licenses in important overseas financial center cities. Therefore, the overseas license assets and network resources of Chinese financial institutions must be particularly cherished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;my country’s financial institutions must send their best talents to overseas financial center cities for experience, accumulate experience in collaboration with international regulatory agencies, establish communication channels, and form an echelon of international financial talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Be on thin ice&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;As early as 1993 to 1994, you assisted American expert Tom Macy in serving the People’s Bank of China’s financial system prudential supervision reform project. 30 years ago, where was the gap between the supervision of China&#39;s financial industry and that of the international market? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Weijun:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Thirty years ago, the gap between China’s financial industry supervision and its international counterparts was mainly due to the lack of professionalism in supervision. It was not until the establishment of the China Banking Regulatory Commission and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission, that is, in 2003, that China formed a specialized regulatory agency and regulatory team. In 1993, there was no technical basis for dialogue between China’s financial regulators and international peers. Therefore, we assisted the People’s Bank of China in designing an accounting subject system and introducing the most basic risk assessment method—five-level loan classification. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, the general direction of China&#39;s financial industry reform was marketization and internationalization. Both regulators and regulated persons had the enthusiasm and initiative to actively learn from foreign experience. This is the starting point for an international dialogue. Professional service organizations, such as Deloitte, mainly serve as a bridge for dialogue and communication between Chinese regulatory agencies, financial companies and international organizations. When China&#39;s financial institutions were reformed and listed, we played the role of &quot;marrying daughters&quot; and carrying the sedan chair. The gap is not terrible. The terrible thing is that there are no people on both sides of the gap who are willing to take a step forward. In the financial industry, we still don’t have the capital to be proud of. We must have an attitude of walking on thin ice. In the financial battlefield, it is never your competitors who defeat you. This is called professionalism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the past 20 years, the financial regulatory system has undergone many changes. The China Banking Regulatory Commission and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission were born out of the People&#39;s Bank of China and were established simultaneously in 2003. Later, they were merged into the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission in 2018 until the State Administration of Financial Supervision was listed in 2023. Do you think there is room for change compared to the international regulatory regime? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Weijun:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;For China’s financial industry, 2023 is an extraordinary year. China&#39;s financial regulatory system has been transformed into &quot;one committee, one bank, one bureau and one meeting.&quot; No matter how the organization is set up, there is only one room for change, and that is to improve professionalism. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the process of improving China&#39;s regulatory level in the past 20 years, I have put forward my professional opinions in three areas and had a positive impact. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first point of view is to strengthen the &quot;iron triangle&quot; relationship of financial supervision. This point of view was raised in 2009 after I returned from my secondment at the UK Financial Regulatory Authority. Under the financial regulatory framework, the &quot;iron triangle&quot; relationship refers to the tripartite relationship between the financial regulatory authorities, the central bank and the Ministry of Finance. The financial crisis tests a country&#39;s financial emergency and leadership capabilities. Improving the coordination capabilities of the &quot;Iron Triangle&quot; relationship and responding quickly and effectively to crises plays an important role. Solving the problems of the financial system requires more than one government agency alone. Even in normal economic times, the three agencies need to coordinate to provide clear and non-duplicate guidance to the financial system. In terms of unified leadership of the financial system, the coordination and execution capabilities of this &quot;iron triangle&quot; need to continue to be improved. Therefore, the establishment of the Central Financial Working Committee is a need for modern economic and financial management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second point of view is to establish a regulatory tripartite negotiation mechanism. This view was raised when I, as a representative of an accounting firm, communicated with the then leaders of the China Banking Regulatory Commission after the establishment of the China Banking Regulatory Commission in March 2003. At that time, I proposed that we should learn from advanced international practices and that the regulatory authorities organize tripartite meetings every year for regulated financial institutions and their external auditors to discuss financial and business risk issues of regulatory concern and arrange regulatory work. Sometimes, closed meetings can even be arranged, where the regulator and the external auditor communicate on important and material issues without the presence of the regulated institution&#39;s management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third point of view is to supervise the shareholders of financial institutions. This was raised seriously by me at a seminar held in Xianghe, Hebei Province in 2005 to prepare for the listing of Bank of China. The bank&#39;s capital adequacy ratio requirement is 8%, which means the bank uses a leverage ratio of 12.5 times. If shareholders are not monitored, banks may be exposed to bad shareholder behavior. Discussion of the proposed regulation of shareholders also extends to Huijin&#39;s management model. I firmly express my support for Huijin’s model and promote Huijin to become a professional management organization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back now, these views of mine can stand the test of time. I believe that some of the views I expressed today will prove to be important 30 years later and will appear on my transcript of professional service to the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, the structure of my country&#39;s financial regulatory system has been significantly adjusted and optimized. Under the existing regulatory framework, how to improve the effectiveness of the regulatory system and operating mechanisms? In terms of operational effectiveness, the following three articles must be done in particular: first, how to attract and retain the best financial talents to join the financial supervision team; second, how to coordinate supervision between the central bank, the State Administration of Financial Supervision, the China Securities Regulatory Commission and other regulatory authorities Collaboration, how to respect the Ministry of Finance’s status as the last savior, how to give full play to the shareholder supervision role of the Financial SASAC (currently undertaken by Huijin and the Financial Department of the Ministry of Finance); third, how to develop and apply more powerful regulatory technology tools to enhance Supervision quality and effectiveness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You suggest attracting and retaining the best financial talents to join the regulatory team. In the civil service sector, how to achieve breakthroughs and attract outstanding talents at market prices? Is there anything we can learn from foreign financial regulatory agencies? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Weijun:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Financial supervision and fiscal management and other institutions must respect professionalism. They function and are professionally based. We must trust experts and not doubt the patriotism possessed by professionals. Technical talents must be protected and supported in the civil service system. In the British and American financial regulatory systems, only high-level people, such as the chairman of the Federal Reserve, are listed in the civil service system. All other professionals are paid according to market prices. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You have said before that the financial industry needs to strengthen supervision . In fact, the financial industry has been tightening regulations. How do you view the relationship between strong supervision and reform and innovation? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Weijun:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Strong supervision and reform and innovation are not contradictory and cannot be neglected. Only by strengthening supervision can we prevent and resolve systemic financial risks; only by reform and innovation can we enhance the diversity of financial products and services, enhance the breadth and depth of the financial market, and better meet the financial needs of the people and the real economy. Smart financial entrepreneurs believe that supporting the real economy is supporting the future of the financial industry. The strengthening and bonding of the relationship between the real economy and the financial industry requires financial innovation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Strong supervision and reform and innovation are &quot;both necessary&quot; and &quot;necessary&quot;. The key is to balance the relationship between supervision and innovation and grasp the intensity and boundaries of supervision. In short, regulation must be neither insufficient nor excessive. Excessive regulation will hinder reform and innovation for sustainable financial development. Of course, reform and innovation cannot be at the expense of significantly increasing systemic financial risks, and financial behaviors that are divorced from the real economy cannot be condoned. &quot;Idling&quot; financial innovation that is divorced from the real economy and within the financial link is &quot;pseudo-innovation&quot; for the purpose of financial profit-seeking, and must be stopped. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“ &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Respect for professionalism is &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;bank reform &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;guarantee of courage in the face of danger &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt; /strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The regulatory system is constantly changing, and banks are also constantly changing. You have participated in and led the design of the &quot;Bank Reform Roadmap&quot; that suits China&#39;s national conditions. At that time, the four major banks were considered &quot;technically bankrupt&quot; due to their extremely large non-performing assets. Where did your courage come from to design a &quot;reform roadmap&quot; and participate in bank reform? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Weijun:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Before the reform, China’s four major state-owned commercial banks were “technically bankrupt” and relied only on implicit state financial guarantees. to make ends meet. If there is no shareholding reform, the four major state-owned commercial banks will go from &quot;technical bankruptcy&quot; to actual bankruptcy. This was an urgent problem that needed to be solved in China&#39;s economic system reform at that time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We dare to design a reform roadmap for the four major state-owned commercial banks that are &quot;technically bankrupt&quot; because we have seen the country&#39;s reform courage and determination to overcome all difficulties; We are confident in our own professional abilities and have the ability to operate on the problems faced by financial institutions; this is because the management of financial institutions are responsible and dare to take responsibility, and can carry out the task list we have listed. In 2003, after completing the audit of Bank of China, we put forward more than 500 management suggestions. The leaders of Bank of China specifically instructed the internal audit department to set up a working group to supervise the implementation of the suggestions we made. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From 2003 to 2006, you served as the signing accountant to assist the Bank of China Listed in Hong Kong and Shanghai.

The basis of this confidence is recognition of financial reform policymakers and leaders, including recognition of the policy directions they have formulated. The leaders of financial institutions realized that failure to reform would lead to a dead end. They used their own knowledge reserves and were willing to cooperate with domestic and foreign experts to find a way out for reform. It was they who proposed, &quot;We need a road map.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The financial reform policymakers and leaders at that time adhered to the direction of marketization and internationalization, respected professionals, trusted and gave full play to the power of domestic and foreign experts. The major state-owned banks have completed the work tasks in the reform stage. The current challenge is to continue to improve their core competitiveness and adapt to the new environment, new changes, and new trends more efficiently. The leaders of major state-owned banks we have dealt with are professional. In any era, we need to respect professionalism. Respecting professionalism is the source of confidence and the guarantee of courage in the face of danger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In addition to assisting Bank of China and Postal Savings Bank of China in their share reform and listing, you He has also served or is currently serving as a signing accountant for China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.

After the stock reform and listing, large state-controlled commercial banks have made remarkable achievements: their financial and risk prevention and control capabilities have been enhanced; their balance sheets have been relatively solid, and their ability to create profits has been enhanced; they have built a &quot;four meetings and one layer&quot; as the core. A corporate governance system recognized by the international capital market; forming a layout for international operations. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But now, bank reform and development are facing more complex and severe challenges. How to build a modern commercial bank is always a difficult problem. It is a complex and arduous project that covers all aspects of strategic management, risk management, information systems and corporate culture. What is particularly difficult is that leaders of state-owned commercial banks must clarify how to balance the policy attributes and commercial attributes of state-owned banks, and achieve both economic benefits and social responsibilities while adhering to the leadership of the party. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why are they motivated to revolutionize themselves? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Weijun:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The power of self-revolution of large state-owned banks mainly comes from the following three aspects: the determination and leadership of the state and the government to run banks well; The governance system of major banks that is in line with international standards has been established; the growth, achievements and positive actions of financial entrepreneurs and professional bankers have been achieved. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let me explain by taking the effectiveness of the boards of directors of major state-owned banks as an example. The boards of directors of large state-owned banks are mainly composed of three groups of directors. One group is equity directors representing state-owned shareholders, who are from the Ministry of Finance and Central Huijin; the other group is independent directors who have international experience and risk management, law, accounting and other fields. professional knowledge; one group is the executive director responsible for operation and management, they are the central management cadres. This is a strong bank strategic management team that is both professional and political.

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;吴卫军：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;会计准则体系、审计市场建设和会计人才水平直接影响一个国家的会计能力。回首改革开放的45年，中国会计准则不断优化完善，实现行业覆盖，全国统一，国际接轨；审计市场进行制度性改革，建成适应国家市场体系的多层次会计师事务所；会计人才培养获得重视，建立国家会计学院，开展全国会计领军人才项目，为中国改革与发展培育专业力量。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“经济越发展，会计越重要”。企业会计准则是市场经济的重要规则，注册会计师行业承担着建设社会诚信的重要责任，而会计人才也是国家发展需要的战略人才。会计准则，注册会计师行业和会计人才的水平是会计能力的重要因素。一个国家的会计能力反映了它的经济制度和政府管治软实力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;黄仁宇教授在《万历十五年》一书中论述了他的大历史观。其中最为重要的一个理论是国家的“数目字管理能力”。他认为，一个稳定的和成熟的商业社会需要具备计算和记录整个社会的资源的能力，只有这样，“资金方便对流，实物经济变为金融经济，可以交换的条件增多，分工进一步合理化，整个国家可以以&#39;数目字管理&#39;”——进而国家可以强盛。简单而言，黄仁宇教授认为，数目字管理能力是国家强盛的基础。我十分认同这个观点。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;会计能力是国家治理能力的基础，特别是在数字经济时代，形成和运用数字资产都需要会计这一基本功能的存在。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;关于会计和金融的关系，我的观点是鲜明的。企业的金融是财务，社会的财务是金融。会计、财务和金融将是“三位一体”的学科。每个人都应老老实实地学点会计知识，因为所有的经济活动最终都要经受“借记”和“贷记”的检验。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;金融企业需从“外延做大”转向“内涵做强”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;吴卫军：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;国有商业银行的资产负债表不再是简单的商业经营实体的资产负债表，而是由中国经济基本面支撑，它反映了中国社会的金融资产分布。商业银行的资产质量，将高度依赖国有经济和政府财务状况的健康度。这是国有大行资产负债表的主体特殊性。银行要发挥好在经济运行中的风险代理监督作用，及时发现风险，并向国家相关部门呈报经济运行中存在的风险和隐患。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;国有商业银行的成绩单必须以“长期主义”为基础，资产负债表的快速扩张更加需要执行严格的风险纪律，特别是严格的信贷纪律。银行家需要更执著地坚持专业主义精神，吸收上一轮去杠杆的教训，提高放贷和购买债券的质量标准，在增量上管好不良资产的入口，同时不断夯实存量资产质量，保持充足的资本和损失吸收缓冲垫，坚持科学的流动性管理方法，坚守一张干净的、健康的、可持续的资产负债表。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;目前看，你认为中国国有银行业还需要深化哪些改革和促进哪些发展？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;吴卫军：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;金融业的发展始终与时代大局保持高度关联。当今世界面临百年未有之大变局，中国金融业已经迎来巨大的历史挑战。 At this important moment in the deepening and development of international and domestic finance, the presence of Chinese financial entrepreneurs is crucial.作为世界第二大经济体，今天中国的金融业，比任何时候都更迫切地需要一支强大的金融企业家队伍，需要他们充分发挥领导力，引领中国金融企业从简单地外延做大，转向高质量地内涵做强。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们要爱护中国的金融企业家。金融是承担风险的行业，金融企业家要做的业务决策就是承担风险的决策。如果运用没有边界的问责制度来束缚金融企业家，这肯定会扼杀金融企业家承担风险的主动性，削弱金融对实体经济的支持。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;金融企业家在社会经济运行中还发挥着一个鲜为人知的功能，他们对社会经济的运行履行着代理监督作用。以银行家为例，他们把贷款借给企业，令他们感到日夜不安的是借款人无法偿还贷款本息的风险。因此，银行家从放贷之日起，就会定期走访企业，要求企业维护健康的财务状况，满足贷款合同要求，这种监督作用提高了中国经济发展的效率；同时，金融机构也累积了有关借款人和行业的知识，为资金有效地流向实体经济把握方向。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中国创新为何会成功？因为中国的经济体量大，试错成本平摊下来很小。成功之后，创新带来的总体经济效果很大。因此，必须要鼓励这样一个试错机制，更好地吸引资本进入创新市场。这就需要投资银行的参与，我们要鼓励培养一批在中国扎根、支撑中国经济向高质量、高效率发展的投资银行家。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[约瑟夫·奈：中美不会彼此构成威胁]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259615]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-31 07:57:30&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;video width=&quot;1440&quot;

&lt;p>;“你当时是怎么想的”“这件事你怎么看”“这个问题有什么解决办法”……记者的套话，已经潜入我们的日常。最近一次从老家返回省城，手机上嘀嗒了一辆顺风车，司机提前半小时接上我，然后南辕北辙，去接下两位乘客。闲聊间，我的记者职业习惯发作，先问他载客情况，后问他乘客背景，再问他从业经历和感受，又问他行业竞争的形势，有一搭没一搭，想了解了解当下顺风车车主的辛酸和快乐。途中服务区休息时，司机主动凑近我：老板，你人真好，和我们聊天客客气气，把我们当自己人，不像有些老板，上了车就催快开快开，一点不能耽误……我笑笑，准备给他解释刚才的聊天行为，不过是一次“流动采访”，他不过是我的又一位“采访对象”。话到嘴边，我还是决定以“老板”自居，回应他的感激：大老板都有人开车，小老板才搭顺风车。顺风，不一定顺路。要顺路，就独享不拼车。我们都是打工的，能理解你的不容易。——一段回应，好像又不自觉暴露自己的职业身份。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“三句话不离本行”，揭示人的表达习惯背后大脑使用的习惯——思维习惯。职场之中，人们沟通交流、处理信息，往往有专用术语或特定话术，日复一日地高频应用，容易形成思维（表达）定势，而当现实场景不断发生变化之时，人们往往难以即时转场、切换到位。人在某个岗位（职位）上的时间越长，相应的表达惯性越大。“三句话不离本行”，也凸显人在思维、表达上的“路径依赖”。人有不同的生活、成长、专业背景。熟悉的话术，令人更有安全感，甚至是优越感：计算机专业出身的官员主政一方时，处处强调“系统化思维”；长期从事职业教育的官员转岗基础教育后，大力倡导“适合的教育”……昨天的“屁股”何以指挥今天的“脑袋”？可能也是一种“肌肉记忆”。&lt;/p>;

I&#39;m surrounded by beautiful women! &quot;&quot; became the number one best-selling game on Steam in China after only one day of being online. Discussions about this game have also become hot searches on social media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This phenomenon deserves concern and analysis. The plot line setting of the game is very simple. You transform into the male protagonist Gu Yi and use the first-person perspective to immersively meet, interact and socialize with six beauties with different ages, looks, personalities and family backgrounds. You can choose one of them. Develop the character deeply and make it your other half: the charming witch who loves to go to nightclubs, the intellectual sister who loves literature and art, the innocent school girl who is not materialistic, the unruly rich lady, the sexy mother who raises her children alone, and the girl who wants to be a little girl at heart. The cool CEO, the choice is yours, which one you will end up with, you can do whatever you want. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, this is a male-oriented love clearance game. The target audience is men. There is no harem or side effects. It is just pure love and satisfying men&#39;s various fantasies about their significant other. There are relatively few games in this category on the market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The public has the impression that young people, especially young men, love to play games, which is true. The hunting and war that our ancestors engaged in in the tribal era were the first priority for survival. This has become the pursuit of power and victory engraved in genes. The mainstream favorites of men are action, combat, war, civilized hegemony and strategy. The game involves a battle of wits and courage. In this type of game, most of the male players are male. Love is either absent or is just an add-on or embellishment. There is a high probability that the game producer has established such a mental position: every man’s dream is to conquer the world. , falling in love is also about capturing a woman’s heart by conquering the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The design idea of ​​this game is very different. It just allows a very ordinary man without any cheats to fall in love with a beautiful woman. Although the game has 12 hidden endings and hundreds of route choices , &quot;Every choice you make will trigger unexpected hidden stories.&quot; However, compared with the mainstream male-oriented games on the market, it is not really complicated, nor can it be said that the workmanship is exquisite, so it must be so popular. Particularly successful is that it hits the pain points of young men. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A major feature of the game is &quot;real-person interactive images&quot;: six beauties with different styles are all played and photographed by real people. In the era of general artificial intelligence (AGI) led by GPT-4, it is not difficult to use AI to design stunning beauties that are more perfect than real people, and the cost is lower. This approach has already had a negative impact on the profit model of &quot;welfare girls&quot; who sell personal photos. The impact. The producers of this game went in the opposite direction, using real people to act on camera, and pre-filmed various plot lines like genuine film and television works, allowing players to choose the objects and plots they want to develop in depth, allowing players to become film and television male protagonists. , the power to control and promote the development of the plot on your own, and it can also approach the experience of interacting with real people in real life, which can be said to be thoughtful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sexual version of this game is the so-called otome game. Otome is a girl. Women choose to fall in love with men, whether they are domineering CEOs, rich second generation, celebrities, or race car drivers. In short, it is to satisfy women&#39;s perfect imagination of their significant other. In terms of proportion, there are several orders of magnitude more otome games than male-oriented romance games. In this sense, &quot;Done!&quot; I&#39;m surrounded by beautiful women! &quot;The reason why it is so popular may be because there are too few such games. Game producers ignore and underestimate men&#39;s emotional needs. In addition, &quot;live-person interactive images&quot; fill the gap, so it suddenly opens up. an ecological niche. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The popularity of this game is enough to show that the male world is not all about killing and working to make money. Men also have emotional needs. Our traditional culture does not encourage men to open up and express themselves. &quot;A man cannot shed tears easily.&quot; Men must appear strong and carry everything without being weak or shrinking. However, everyone has moments of weakness and emotions. There are times when I cannot bear the need to express myself and my emotions break down. Men are human beings too, and their spiritual world should also be cared for. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a long time, men’s voices have been absent from public opinion. In the statements of some merchants, there is even a saying that &quot;men&#39;s consumption power is not as good as that of dogs.&quot; However, this situation is changing. The values ​​and consumption concepts of the new generation of young men are very different from their parents. They care more about themselves and invest more in their own image and spiritual world. For example, in recent years, the consumption and consumption of male cosmetics have increased annually. Significantly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to iiMedia Consulting data, among Chinese users who choose to shop through online live streaming channels, 58% are men and 42% are women. Among them, those born in the 1980s and 1990s are the main shopping force, accounting for The total exceeds 80%; live streaming e-commerce shopping users are mainly distributed in first- and second-tier cities, with second-tier cities leading the way with 42%. This is very different from the impression some people have. The consumption power of young men is rising and blowing out, which is a trend worthy of attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When men convert their productivity into consumption power, they also win the hospitality of businesses. This is the rule of the game in the consumer society. &quot;It&#39;s over!&quot; I&#39;m surrounded by beautiful women! 》The fire is another footnote. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, since it is a romance game, it will inevitably lead some people to discuss the relationship between games and reality. Some people worry that the quality of opposite-sex partners in romance games is much higher than in real life, which will cause players to invisibly raise their inner expectations and standards for mate selection, and lose interest in the available partners in reality. There should be a real social investigation on whether this effect exists and how big it is, and it is meaningless to talk about it in the air. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, a person who has to earn money to support his family and career during working hours, but only occasionally spends some time playing games during get off work hours or weekends to satisfy his dreams and fantasies that cannot be realized in real life, should not be punished. Even if you are harsh, you won’t lose your sense of reality just by playing a few games, because the gravity of the real world is strong enough to pull you back to the ground. Occasionally falling into fantasy, even if it is a fantasy that cannot be realized, will make a person&#39;s heart shine, or make the soul gain a sense of relaxation and transcendence, which is necessary for a person&#39;s mental health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, if you are completely immersed and lost in fantasy due to the lack of anchors in the real world, and never want to get out of the virtual world, or use the perfect objects in the virtual world to ask for optional objects in the real world, then of course It is a pathology and not desirable. A sane adult should never go to this point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 30 Oct 2023 22:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[​张又侠：中国军队绝不答应、绝不手软]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259617]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-30 21:25:13&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 30 Oct 2023 21:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[对话上野千鹤子：学术是弱者的武器丨视频]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259590]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-30 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 30 Oct 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[500万人次求助，800亿元捐赠：慈善法修正可否终结个人求助争议]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259592]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-30 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;In 2022, when a girl fell from a building, her family asked for help on Shuidichou. At present, this type of personal help donations has exceeded 80 billion yuan.

At present, such individual donations for help have exceeded 80 billion yuan. Chinese Business Daily Visual China Map&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Starting from October 25, 2023, the draft amendment to the Charity Law after deliberation at the sixth meeting of the Standing Committee of the 14th National People&#39;s Congress will be officially released for public comment. The revised draft adds new content to regulate personal help-seeking behavior and the management of personal help-seeking online service platforms, which is considered to fill the legislative gaps and has attracted much attention. On the National People&#39;s Congress website, this is called one of the four highlights of this draft amendment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the recent incident of a 2-year-old girl being bitten by a Rottweiler dog in Chengdu, public opinion questioned the individual&#39;s request for help. After the girl was bitten, her family started to raise 2 million yuan on the Easy Raising Platform. Within 5 hours and 18 minutes, more than 87,000 people donated, and the donation goal was achieved. But the girl&#39;s family quickly fell into disputes over the amount of the aid and the use of the funds. On October 25, EasyCho released refund instructions and refunded all unused donations in full. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to reports, Xu Anbiao, deputy director of the Legal Affairs Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress, said that the original intention of this revision of the law is to improve the charity, fundraising, funding, service and other systems during emergencies, and to address some new issues that have emerged in the charity field. New situations and new problems, summarizing practical experience, such as &quot;fingertip public welfare&quot; and &quot;public welfare for everyone&quot; and other new situations and new problems that have emerged in the Internet era, it is necessary to reasonably regulate these phenomena and improve relevant systems. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;There are endless problems with personal help-seeking&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Charity Law was reviewed and passed by the National People&#39;s Congress in March 2016 and has been in effect for 7 years. However, personal help-seeking has not been included in the regulation before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jia Xijin, a professor at the School of Public Administration at Tsinghua University and deputy director of the Philanthropy Research Institute, told Southern Weekend reporters that the legislative purpose of the Charity Law is to promote charity and regulate charity behaviors and charitable organizations. Charitable organizations can raise funds publicly for public welfare purposes and enjoy tax-free treatment, which is equivalent to the use of public resources, so its beneficiaries must be a non-specific public rather than a specific individual. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Personal help-seeking does not meet the purpose of public welfare, so the Charity Law did not regulate personal help-seeking at the beginning of the legislation. However, in recent years, with the help of online fundraising platforms such as LoveChou, EasyChou and ShuidiChou, personal help-seeking has become more active and prominent than charity activities, and problems in the field of personal help-seeking have also emerged one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2016, Luo Yixiao, a 6-year-old girl from Shenzhen, Guangdong, unfortunately suffered from leukemia. Her father Luo Er wrote an article online to raise about 2.7 million yuan for treatment expenses. Later, it was revealed that Luo Er had three houses and three companies in his home. He also said in an interview that &quot;the house in Shenzhen is reserved for his son,&quot; which caused him to be questioned. Amid the whirlpool of public opinion, Luo Yixiao died of illness, and Luo Er also returned all donations to the donors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, Wang Fengya, a 3-year-old girl from Taikang County, Henan Province, suffered from retinoblastoma. Her mother requested help on multiple online platforms. In April 2018, it was revealed that his mother had donated 150,000 yuan through fraudulent donations to treat her son&#39;s cleft lip. Although the police investigation found that the donation fraud claim was untrue, Wang Fengya died of illness in May of that year, and her family was also subjected to online abuse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Amid repeated controversies, calls for strengthening supervision of online fundraising platforms are getting louder and louder. In 2018, under the guidance of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the three major online fundraising platforms, LoveChou, EasyChou and ShuidiChou, issued a self-discipline convention. This was upgraded again in 2020, proposing that platforms should abide by seven &quot;bottom-line rules&quot; to strengthen platform self-discipline management and improve Risk prevention level and improve social supervision mechanism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 6, 2019, the country’s first online dispute over personal critical illness help was pronounced. In this case, Mr. Mo launched a personal fundraising campaign on Shuidichou for his seriously ill son. However, because he concealed his property and other social assistance, the fundraising platform took him to court and demanded the return of the donation. After trial, the Beijing Chaoyang District Court found that Mr. Mo misappropriated the funds raised for other purposes in violation of the agreed purpose, constituting a breach of contract. The first instance order ordered the full return of more than 150,000 yuan raised and the payment of corresponding interest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the press conference after the verdict was announced in the case, Wang Min, the president of the Wangjing Tribunal of the Chaoyang District Court, pointed out that there are problems in the field of personal help for serious illnesses on the Internet, such as unclear legal definitions and overly principled provisions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The judgment of the case also mentioned: &quot;At present, only departmental regulations stipulate that personal seeking help does not belong to charitable fundraising and charitable public fundraising information. Regarding the rights between the network platform and the donor in personal seeking help for serious illness on the Internet, The obligations have not yet been clearly defined.” In addition, many unclear boundaries emerged during the trial, such as whether Mr. Mo provided comprehensive information, whether the fundraising platform should provide separate items to fill in the family property item by item, whether there were insufficient verifications, etc. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To this end, the Chaoyang District Court sent judicial suggestions to the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the Shuidichou platform respectively, recommending that the Ministry of Civil Affairs coordinate and promote the legislation on personal help-seeking behavior for serious illnesses, establish and improve departmental regulations, and promote orderly personal help-seeking for serious illnesses on the Internet. carry out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Guoke, a lawyer at Beijing Zhicheng Law Firm, analyzed to Southern Weekend reporters that as an individual right, individual seeking help is not subject to legal restrictions or prohibitions. For example, going to the streets to beg, as long as it does not violate city management regulations; seeking help from classmates or relatives after falling ill is a small-scale personal request for help. Whether the information for help is true or not only involves both the donor and the recipient. issues of rights and obligations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, due to the factors of the Internet, the scope of communication and influence of personal help-raising on the Internet have changed dramatically. At this time, the authenticity of the help-seeking information has a certain degree of publicity. Netizens who make donations on an online fundraising platform are both donors and users of the platform. From the perspective of providing services to users, the platform also needs to verify the authenticity of the information of the help seekers, &quot;for our vast number of donors.&quot; Very good.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More importantly, the volume of personal requests for help on the Internet is huge. The first domestic &quot;Research Report on the Personal Serious Illness Help-Seeking Internet Platform (2022)&quot; shows that according to incomplete statistics, from September 2014 to the end of 2021, a total of more than 5 million serious illness patients posted help information through the personal serious illness help-seeking Internet service platform, and more than 20 100 million people donated funds through critical illness help platforms including Shuidichou, with a fundraising scale of more than 80 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Individual seeking help is a relatively active and large-scale phenomenon in society at present, and it is necessary for the Charity Law to respond in principle to this.” Jia Xijin said, but the current amendment to the Charity Law includes the addition of individuals The content of asking for help does not mean that individual asking for help is regarded as a charitable activity. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Information inspection” rather than “information review”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As a member of the Expert Advisory Committee of the Social Organization Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, He Guoke participated in the meeting discussion of the revised draft of the Charity Law. According to him, due to the essential difference between personal help-seeking and charitable public welfare activities, the personal help-seeking section did not include chapters on charitable donations and charitable fundraising. Instead, it was placed in the supplementary provisions, and in the form of authorized legislation, the Civil Affairs Department of the State Council, in conjunction with Relevant departments will formulate specific management measures separately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This draft amendment to the Charity Law clarifies: If an individual causes financial difficulties for his family due to illness or other reasons, and releases information for help to the society, the person seeking help and the information publisher shall be responsible for the authenticity of the information, and the personal assistance network service The platform shall bear the obligation to inspect information, and specific management measures shall be formulated separately by the civil affairs department of the State Council in conjunction with relevant departments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Guoke believes that compared with the first revised draft, the latest revised draft has three main adjustments to the content of personal help-seeking: first, the definition of personal help-seeking puts more emphasis on the reasons of &quot;personal illness&quot;; In addition, the &quot;network service provider&quot; in the amendment is clearly defined as &quot;personal assistance network service platform&quot; in the amendment, which means that when the Ministry of Civil Affairs formulates specific management measures in the future, it is likely to re-qualify the platform party to do so. Stricter management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last adjustment is that the &quot;information review obligation&quot; that the platform should bear is changed to &quot;information inspection obligation.&quot; &quot;&#39;Review&#39; is more important than &#39;inspection&#39;.&quot; He Guoke said that the platform has not been granted the power and responsibility like government departments and judicial agencies, and cannot review the property in the name of the requester. &quot;For example, the requester said that he only has one house. &quot;The platform can only see that the real estate certificate of this house is basically true, but it cannot go to the Housing Authority to check how many properties he owns in total.&quot; This adjustment was made after considering the opinions of multiple platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jia Xijin believes that in the draft amendment to the Charity Law, it is necessary to add the principle content that &quot;the person asking for help and the person publishing the information should be responsible for the authenticity of the information&quot; because the basis for personal seeking help is still civil. In the &quot;gift&quot; relationship, the primary responsible parties are both the donor and the recipient. &quot;Whoever publishes false information is responsible&quot;; as a third party that promotes cooperation, the platform needs to conduct necessary formal reviews, such as requiring family financial information. Certificates, medical certificates, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the above-mentioned Shuidichiou case, the Chaoyang District Court held that the Shuidichiou platform has strict formal review obligations and strict supervision obligations. In this case, the court found that Shuidichiou had review flaws, but this did not affect Mr. Mo’s responsibility to return the donation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to information provided by Shuidichou to Southern Weekend reporters, Shuidichou has currently strengthened measures to ensure the authenticity of fundraising cases, using technology and manual methods to pass preliminary review, reexamination, third-party review, etc. The platform will continuously review user information. Only after the platform reviews the information is correct and meets the qualifications, can online fundraising be initiated normally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the materials provided by Shuidichou, the platform intercepted an average of 12 fundraising applications that did not meet the requirements every day. In the first half of the year, it intercepted and rejected a total of 2,096 fundraising applications that did not meet the launch conditions, including There are 544 illegal users who have been permanently blacklisted from the platform and are prohibited from launching fundraising again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in Jia Xijin&#39;s view, individual case assistance and personal help are like &quot;after-care medicine&quot; for the plight of seriously ill families. They can exist but do not need to become bigger and stronger. She believes that it is more important to establish multiple response mechanisms, such as inclusive medical insurance and medical assistance systems, commercial insurance, public welfare advocacy and beneficiary services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 30 Oct 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
