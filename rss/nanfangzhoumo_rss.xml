Among them, the &quot;Basic Funeral Services&quot; refusal to trade dispute case involves the identification and legal liability of public enterprises&#39; refusal to trade, which is worth mentioning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the website of the Supreme People&#39;s Court, the basic facts of this typical case are: Quanzhou Licheng Lisheng Funeral Service Co., Ltd. (Lisheng Company), which is mainly engaged in funeral intermediary services, sued for the prosecution of Quanzhou Jiying Funeral Service Co., Ltd. (Jiying Company) is a public enterprise that provides basic funeral services such as cremation of remains. Because Lisheng Company reported that Jiying Company charged illegally, Jiying Company refused Lisheng Company to apply for cremation services on behalf of the relatives of the deceased, which violated the regulations. In accordance with the provisions of the Anti-Monopoly Law prohibiting administrative monopoly, the company requested an order to order Jiying Company to resume handling relevant business for Lisheng Company and to compensate for economic losses of 80,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The court of first instance held that Lisheng Company failed to prove that Jiying Company was the executive entity of the administrative monopoly regulated by the Anti-Monopoly Law, and ruled to reject all claims of Lisheng Company. Lisheng Company was dissatisfied and appealed, claiming that Jiying Company&#39;s refusal was an abuse of market dominance prohibited by the Anti-Monopoly Law. The second instance of the Supreme Court found that Jiying Company, as a public enterprise with a monopoly position in the basic funeral service market in central Quanzhou, refused to handle relevant business for Lisheng Company, constituting a refusal to trade prohibited by the Anti-Monopoly Law, and ruled that Jiying Company Compensate Lisheng Company for losses of RMB 80,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The trial process of this case is very interesting. In the first instance, Lisheng Company held that Jiying Company&#39;s refusal to trade with it violated the provisions of the Anti-Monopoly Law prohibiting administrative monopoly. The court of first instance held that Lisheng Company failed to prove that Jiying Company was the executive entity of the administrative monopoly regulated by the Anti-Monopoly Law, so it rejected Lisheng Company&#39;s appeal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what are the provisions of the Anti-Monopoly Law on administrative monopoly? According to Chapter 5 of the Anti-Monopoly Law, administrative agencies and organizations authorized by laws and regulations to manage public affairs shall not abuse administrative power to exclude or restrict competition. From a legal perspective, the implementing entities of administrative monopoly should be “administrative agencies and organizations authorized by laws and regulations to manage public affairs.” On the surface, Jiying Company is an enterprise, not an administrative agency, and is not authorized by laws and regulations to manage public affairs. It does not seem qualified to be the subject of administrative monopoly. So what kind of company is Jiying Company? After digging through the layers, it was discovered that Jiying Company is a state-owned company 100% controlled by the Quanzhou State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. More importantly, Jiying Company operates the only funeral parlor in the main urban area of ​​Quanzhou City. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yes, funeral parlors in other places are generally public institutions affiliated with the civil affairs department, but Quanzhou City hands over the operation of funeral parlors to a state-owned enterprise. This state-owned enterprise is responsible for providing basic funeral services, including cremation of remains, in the main urban area of ​​Quanzhou City. This is the only funeral home in the main urban area of ​​Quanzhou that can provide cremation services. According to the reply letter to the CPPCC members&#39; proposal published by the Quanzhou Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau in 2019, the funeral business in the main urban area of ​​Quanzhou was transferred to Jiying Group for management. In other words, Jiying Company’s monopoly on the basic funeral service market in the main urban area of ​​Quanzhou is the result of administrative transfer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is it legal for a state-owned enterprise that provides basic public services, which is in a monopoly position due to administrative orders, to refuse to trade with a downstream enterprise because it reported that it charged excessively? The court of first instance rejected the plaintiff&#39;s petition on the grounds that the defendant was not a qualified subject of administrative monopoly. There seemed to be nothing wrong with the procedure. However, it objectively maintained Jiying Company&#39;s monopoly status and made it impossible for the plaintiff to carry out normal operations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, during the appeal, Lisheng Company changed its strategy and claimed that Jiying Company’s refusal was an abuse of market dominance and refusal to trade. The Supreme Court also held in the second instance that Jiying Company is a public enterprise with an exclusive position in the local basic funeral service market, and the basic funeral services it provides are specific services that are indispensable for the downstream funeral intermediary companies to carry out services, and the downstream funeral agencies There is no alternative to the agency. Jiying Company refused to handle relevant business for Lisheng Company, which resulted in Lisheng Company being completely excluded from the funeral agency service market in downtown Quanzhou, excluding and limiting competition in the funeral agency service market, and damaging its reputation as a countermeasures company. The interests of consumers’ relatives of the deceased in the sense of the Monopoly Law constitute a refusal to trade prohibited by the Anti-Monopoly Law. Therefore, it was ruled that Jiying Company should resume Lisheng Company’s application for the cremation business on behalf of the relatives of the deceased under legal and compliant conditions, and compensate them The refusal to trade caused a loss of 80,000 yuan to Lisheng Company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the relevant judgment documents published on the China Judgment Documents Network, the cause of the incident was a business of renting ice coffins to store remains in October 2019. The plaintiff believed that the defendant had illegally charged an extra 200 yuan in rent. Complaints to market regulatory authorities. After that, the defendant no longer accepted the plaintiff’s application to the defendant for cremation of remains on behalf of the deceased’s family. In order to protect their rights and interests, the plaintiff complained to the Quanzhou Municipal Market Supervision Bureau, Civil Affairs Bureau, and National Development and Reform Commission, and took the civil affairs, municipal supervision and other departments to court many times for administrative inaction. However, these complaints and lawsuits all failed without exception. Even in the first-instance civil lawsuit heard by the intermediate court in another place, there was still no support. It wasn&#39;t until he appealed to the Supreme Court that he was finally supported. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar phenomena are not uncommon. Some local governments transfer the responsibility of certain basic public services to state-owned enterprises, which is called marketization and actually forms an administrative monopoly. These state-owned enterprises have an absolute monopoly in this field of public services and may even be assigned some management functions that should be the responsibility of the administrative department. Their leaders are often close to the regulatory authorities. Therefore, these state-owned enterprises are often arrogant when facing downstream enterprises or consumers. Once downstream companies or consumers mess with such state-owned enterprises, they will be put in the shoes of others. Just like in this case, because Lisheng Company complained about Jiying Company&#39;s excessive charges, Jiying Company used the excuse that Lisheng Company violated laws and regulations during the funeral process and refused to allow Lisheng Company to handle the cremation business on behalf of the family of the deceased. However, it is very difficult for downstream companies or consumers to safeguard their rights. Locally, they will basically encounter obstacles everywhere, and they can only be solved at a higher level or even at the central level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although this kind of public service provision by enterprises designated by administrative power does not comply with the legal provisions on &quot;administrative monopoly&quot; on the surface, it is essentially the same as administrative monopoly. They both rely on administrative power to monopolize the market. Put on a pair of &quot;corporate&quot; white gloves. These &quot;public enterprises&quot; with monopoly status should not be viewed with caution against administrative monopolies to prevent them from using their monopoly status to harm the interests of upstream and downstream enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 24 Sep 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[在德国小镇，偶遇“乱世佳人”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257446]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-24 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/20/2xLRyrFir4VYv8Pl4SihiUfphbeTRVncavXAsDeI.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/2xLRyrFir4VYv8Pl4SihiUfphbeTRVncavXAsDeI. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251388&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Portrait of Barbara and herself when she was young&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa ;&quot;>;(Children&#39;s words/pictures)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meeting Barbara and her story was a completely unexpected gain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I originally just came to see an old friend.

My friend really wanted me to talk to this old lady. Before I could ask why, she couldn’t help but introduce Barbara’s life: she was born into a wealthy manor family, and later became a refugee.

It happened to be that Friday, and my friend made an appointment to go to my mother-in-law’s house, so I quickly followed. The walk to Barbara&#39;s house was short, just through the garden from the back door of a friend&#39;s house. The kitchen door opened, and a silver-haired old man walked out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/Ewe46mb8M527fPetxAplol6ggihKhOi2qtw1apBB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/Ewe46mb8M527fPetxAplol6ggihKhOi2qtw1apBB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251386&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Barbara&#39;s family&#39;s manor&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Children&#39;s words/pictures)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First meeting with Barbara Bara, I can&#39;t help but marvel: This old lady is so tough! He walks steadily and has a loud voice. He doesn&#39;t look like he is 93 years old. After her husband&#39;s death, Barbara lived alone for more than ten years. Not only did she take care of her own daily life and food, but she also took care of the two-story house and large garden. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Seeing me as an unexpected guest, Barbara generously invited me in. A friend suggested that we sit at the dining table and chat. Barbara pretended to be angry and shook her head: &quot;How can we sit comfortably?&quot; She moved the brewed tea and small cakes to the coffee table at the end of the living room. The room was a little dark, so Barbara turned on the light, turned to the room, took out two photo albums, and placed them in front of me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/OcMHVTXqMHcQe2kwEIEp8f4ukEVBp6ihHTZqqzLr.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/OcMHVTXqMHcQe2kwEIEp8f4ukEVBp6ihHTZqqzLr.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251390&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The three Barbara sisters and their mother&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Children&#39;s words/pictures)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This It’s my old home,” Barbara said. She pointed to a black and white photo in the center of the album&#39;s home page. The pixels were very low and a bit blurry, but I could still tell that it was a large castle-like house that could accommodate at least a dozen luxurious suites. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Barbara, who was born in 1931, has lived in this big house with her two sisters since she was a child. Her family is very wealthy, and the town where the manor is located, whether it is farmland, shops or churches, is all Barbara&#39;s family property. They hired thousands of employees to take care of everything in the manor. Barbara&#39;s childhood was pampered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But such a privileged life came to an abrupt end when Barbara was 14 years old. In 1945, Germany was defeated and the country was occupied by partitions. Barbara&#39;s family estate was located on the border of East and West Germany, and was transferred to East Germany at the last minute. If they were ordinary people, they might not be affected too much. The prominence of the Barbara family and the &quot;corrupt farmer life&quot; they lived made them the target of public criticism. On the eve of the end of the war, the Soviet army that took over captured Barbara&#39;s father and gave orders to other family members to pack up and leave within 4 hours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/yoMl9Fb7ylFmYAlyagMxakIViKgJyJrPZuxY4mGV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/yoMl9Fb7ylFmYAlyagMxakIViKgJyJrPZuxY4mGV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251389&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Barbara&#39;s Little Bear&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Children&#39;s words/pictures)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One night During this time, Barbara was reduced from an aristocratic lady to a refugee. Fortunately, thanks to my mother&#39;s bravery and resourcefulness, the family of five was able to reunite safely. They climbed onto the train in the dark, crossed the border, and hid with relatives in West Germany. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From then on, Barbara not only had to take care of her own life, but also had to learn farm work from scratch. When I asked Barbara if she ever felt particularly miserable, she laughed. She is always smiling, and when she talks about the past, it feels like she is describing someone else&#39;s adventure story, without any resentment or sadness on her face. She even looked like a child, her shoulders curled up when she was happy, and she leaned on the sofa with a smile on her face. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Barbara said that she did not feel bitter at all, but felt extremely lucky. After all, the family was intact. She only remembers the ruins of post-war towns, or the happy times she spent laughing in the rice fields with her family. Later, they came to settle in the small town of Rothenburg. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The war delayed Barbara&#39;s studies, but she has always had a dream to become a flight attendant, because her mother said that being a flight attendant allows her to experience different cultures. At that time, Germany had very high requirements for flight attendants, and you had to master two foreign languages ​​to apply. In her early twenties, Barbara decided to go abroad. Her family contacted a family in Sweden who needed a nanny for her, and she set out alone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Barbara stayed in Sweden for three years and met her future husband, who was also German. Her husband wanted to return to Germany, so Barbara&#39;s dream of being a flight attendant ended. She settled down to become a housewife and raised four children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/iUpQf4uhYGqNGZWs078ZkOGV7cdJHXt16OvID5OU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/iUpQf4uhYGqNGZWs078ZkOGV7cdJHXt16OvID5OU.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251391&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Barbara in her garden&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Children&#39;s words/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Up In the 1970s, Barbara&#39;s family contacted the East German government. After numerous lawsuits, Sister Barbara finally received some compensation. The former manor is now managed by a government foundation. The pastoral scenery and splendor of the past can only be recorded thanks to the photos taken by Barbara’s mother during her lifetime. If no one asked, Barbara rarely told her story to outsiders. She just typed out an &quot;autobiography&quot; of more than thirty pages on a typewriter and left it to her four children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The epic story of nearly a hundred years was condensed into one afternoon&#39;s narration, which I found intoxicating and exciting. I asked Barbara if there was one item that she still regrets leaving in her home at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Barbara spent a few minutes thinking, and I guessed that the answer might be related to gold and silver jewelry. Unexpectedly, she answered: &quot;My little stuffed bear!&quot; She pointed behind her seriously. Said: &quot;So I sewed one for myself!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After hearing this, my friend and I burst into laughter. Barbara explained a little embarrassedly: &quot;I was only a 14-year-old child at the time...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before leaving, Barbara took out a small notebook and asked me to leave a message in it. I wrote in Chinese and Swedish respectively: Dear Barbara, I wish you health and happiness forever. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 24 Sep 2023 20:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[电影《流水落花》：努力将生活这张旧报纸展平]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257533]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-24 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The veteran escort for the Best Actress who has failed nine times finally stepped onto the podium. At the 41st Hong Kong Film Awards, Sammi Cheng, who won the Best Actress Award, couldn&#39;t hide her excitement: &quot;I want to thank God for not letting me have a smooth journey. It is these lack of smooth sailing that have taught me to be humble and gentle... (At this moment) I can’t be gentle. I’m really happy tonight. I finally don’t have to run silently with you on the track, and I can finally cross the finish line with my head held high.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 15, 2023, nearly half a year after winning the award, Sammi Cheng &quot;Flowing Water and Falling Flowers&quot;, the film&#39;s best-selling novel, has finally been released in mainland China. But in the movie, the honors on the awards podium disappear along with the ambition. People saw that Sammi Cheng appeared on the screen without any appearance and almost gave the most &quot;light&quot; performance in her career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/6iHG1ya14BlHIBF5Hl1mIeOOZ3W0uzIhzOHXLmqu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/6iHG1ya14BlHIBF5Hl1mIeOOZ3W0uzIhzOHXLmqu.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251821&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Sammi Cheng (left) in the movie &quot;Falling Water&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The story of &quot;Flowing Water and Falling Flowers&quot; is not complicated. Tianmei, played by Sammi Cheng, was originally a ride-on on the school bus. As a caretaker, due to a change in the school bus route, she quit her job and returned home to be a temporary mother in a &quot;foster family&quot;. Together with her husband Bin, who drove for her boss, she raised the children from social welfare institutions in stages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The children come from different family backgrounds: some have fathers in jail, and some are waiting for adoption due to their own illnesses. Life revolves around children again, and the hidden pain belonging to this family slowly emerges: a few years ago, Tianmei and Bin&#39;s young child died. Being a foster parent is also filling the void of &quot;parent&quot; status. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To some extent, Tianmei, Bin and the passers-by in this family are all &quot;aphasic&quot; in society. When the family decided to become a foster family, they began to encounter scrutiny from the so-called healthy operating system. Whenever the social worker asked to come to the door in half an hour, Tianmei felt as if she was facing an enemy. According to regulations, one of the couple must stay at home with the child during the parenting period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bed and table should be as tidy as possible, cigarettes are an absolute taboo, and even the smell of cigarettes must be dispersed, which is regarded as a sign of &quot;unhealthy&quot;. But for such a couple who have been silently enduring the shadow of the loss of their child for a long time and living a difficult life, they really can&#39;t imagine a healthier way to resolve it - those moments when they are discouraged, worn out by daily life, and scattered and need to be sorted out. It needs to be dispelled by a silent cigarette. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Movies that focus on people at the bottom of society or on the margins can easily tend to over-emphasize their social side, as if people’s situations have become props to display social problems; the other extreme is an excess of warmth that overwhelms people. The details of getting along too warmly with people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Flowing Water and Falling Flowers&quot; tries its best to stay in the middle ground. It never gives up on capturing tender moments. A foster boy was injured and sent to the hospital for injuries while he was alone at home. The social worker then questioned &quot;Aunt Tianmei&quot; and &quot;Uncle Bin&quot;, and he cleverly excused them - Aunt Tianmei was not at home and had gone to buy medicine for herself. They spent the Spring Festival together, watching the fireworks bloom over the city, and their emotions were intimate and harmonious. But almost the next second, the life of this relationship in the image came to an abrupt end. A new foster child has arrived. There were no ostentatious farewells or overly bitter farewells. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Flowing Water and Falling Flowers&quot; has a vague flavor of Japanese movies. When it needs concentration, it often falls into a sentimental and mournful atmosphere. For example, Tianmei was sitting on the balcony eating cake, letting the rain and wind splash into her territory, leaving water stains on her pants. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She often stood alone on the bridge, waiting for the sunlight to move inch by inch over the narrow water channel, taking away the darkness from her side. &quot;I don&#39;t really like to express my feelings with open and wide expressions, but I like to observe things from a detached and cold perspective, so the film may be the same.&quot; Director Jia Shengfeng said in an interview with the media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no narrative ambition in the movie, and some exciting sequences seem to be just making up for the excessive static of life itself. When the mother of a foster boy came to her door feeling out of control, the social worker apologetically told Tianmei that she would immediately help find a new foster family. Tianmei therefore expressed dissatisfaction: He is not a commodity and can be moved around at any time. This is obviously not the first time a similar situation has occurred. The boy had just established trust with them, and they were about to be separated again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/c78u1GrqVdJMyQ3r85w3y4ocTJQqFYq0t5q7onpZ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/c78u1GrqVdJMyQ3r85w3y4ocTJQqFYq0t5q7onpZ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251820&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stills from the movie &quot;Flowing Water and Falling Flowers&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the foster children, Tianmei once considered adopting a girl with cleft lip and palate. But the social worker told her that adoptive families do not have the right to choose their children. According to certain assessment standards, the best adoptive parents for a girl with cleft lip and palate are an American couple, implying that Tianmei and Bin are economically disadvantaged. Tianmei rarely expressed anger: Have you asked your children for their opinions? How to judge the best? At that time, the girl with cleft lip and palate already called Tianmei &quot;mom&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sometimes, turbulent past events emerge suddenly and briefly, such as during bedtime conversations or invitations for intimate behavior. Her husband repeatedly proposed having another child, but Tianmei retorted: What should I do if there is another genetic disease this time? The conversation stopped there, with no further emotion. They accepted the death of their son tacitly, and had no intention of chewing, sorting out, or repeating their grief. Their life is like an old newspaper that is constantly being rubbed by fate. The purpose of living is just to flatten it bit by bit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the title of the film &quot;Falling Flowers in Flowing Water&quot; suggests, foster children are like flowers that have fallen temporarily, and life has temporarily brought them to Tianmei&#39;s family. Some netizens commented: In the first half of the film, the children are like falling flowers and the foster families are like running water. In the second half of the story, the foster family becomes the fallen flower, and the children are the running water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Indeed. Looking at it, after losing their children, Tianmei and Bin&#39;s lives have almost come to a standstill. The life they have been practicing year after year cannot see many changes. When the children arrived, the family just regained some vitality and was full of dynamics - the children&#39;s childhood naughtiness was left in the form of graffiti on the wall. Pencils marked the gradually rising height lines and pasted them on the mirror to teach the children to smile more cheerfully. The flower stickers were put on and then taken off, and a pair of siblings who loved skipping classes wrote on the wall: Jia Xi Jia Lang is here for a visit. These connected graffiti show the flow of time within this family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《流水落花》中，有一个镜头点明了导演捕捉时间真身的意图——在天美的想象与回忆中，在这个家庭里待过的孩子们，按照个头站成行，如手机信号般排列。第一个来到寄养家庭的小男孩最为矮小，处在会惊恐到尿裤子的阶段；而在这个家庭停留的最后一个男孩，17岁，已能帮天美扛米、穿针。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;7个寄养孩子流水般在这个家庭停驻过。年龄段从小学到初中再到高中，《流水落花》展现了一对夫妻可能遭遇的一切养育子女的问题。在这样的设计里，影片抹除了创痛为这个家庭带来的特殊性，还原了一个更具普遍性的家庭境遇。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在小学的家长同乐日，他们像所有正常的父母那样，帮助孩子参加体育比赛，鼓励孩子恢复自信；在17岁的少年表达想要永远留在家里时，又坦然接受孩子最终将要走向更大的世界的现实。从这个意义上讲，导演在冷淡疏离的影片风格下，填埋了一个温馨的底座。毕竟，对于天美和彬来说，这或许已是现实中最好的结局。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 24 Sep 2023 19:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[病儿为何大额捐赠自家？儿慈会明星项目“冲配捐”调查]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257557]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-24 17:59:30&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/09/24/928a05c694.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/ 24/928a05c694.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251850&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In order to arouse the enthusiasm of the whole people to participate in public welfare, the organizers of 99 Charity Day They introduced matching donations. (Visual China/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As a charitable organization with strong fundraising capabilities, the China Children’s Charity Aid Foundation (referred to as Children’s Charity Society) has recently fallen into disarray. In the midst of the donation turmoil. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In September 2023, Ke Mouxiao was accused of using the Children&#39;s Charity Society&#39;s &quot;9958 Children&#39;s Emergency Assistance&quot; project (hereinafter referred to as 9958) to defraud families of seriously ill children out of nearly 1,000 yuan. 10,000 life-saving money was detained by the police. The Children&#39;s Charity Association publicly stated that Ke Mouxiao was not its staff and had only served as a volunteer in the Hebei Langfang Team Cooperation Organization of the 9958 Project. But the controversy has not yet died down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Many parents of children who were deceived said that they participated in the &quot;matching donation&quot; initiated by Ke Mouxiao and transferred the funds to Ke Mouxiao. They expected that within a period of time Afterwards, a return higher than the principal amount will be obtained, and the excess will be donated by the enterprise. Because this kind of &quot;matching donation&quot; is a normal operation mode in the charity sector, and families of seriously ill children are accustomed to it, there is no doubt about the authenticity of the project initiated by Ke Mouxiao. (For details, please see Southern Weekly’s report &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/contents/256685?source=131&quot;>;China Children’s Charity Association volunteers are involved in nearly 10 million yuan in aid, and families with serious illness are in trouble again.

According to relevant laws and policies, it is illegal for charitable organizations to induce parents of children with self-raised funds to participate in matching donations or donate for their own use. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Does the Children&#39;s Charity Association know about such &quot;matching donations&quot;? Southern Weekend reporters discovered that deficiencies in the management and operation of charitable organizations provide a breeding ground for the alienation of matching donations. The more money is raised, the more matching donations are made - with the same goal, the people who need the money most take their money out of their pockets, boosting the charity&#39;s fundraising figures. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Who dares to do it if you can’t get the money back?”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It’s the 99 Charity Day in September every year.

He decided to participate in &quot;matching donations.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;99 Charity Day is a national charity event jointly launched by Internet companies and hundreds of charity organizations, enterprises, and celebrities. September 9, 2015 is China&#39;s first Internet Charity Day. In order to arouse the enthusiasm of the whole people to participate in public welfare, the organizers introduced a popular foreign method-matching donations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Matching donation is matching donation. After one donor donates a sum of money to a charity organization, another donor (usually a company) will randomly or according to Donate a certain percentage of money to the same charity organization. The original intention of the matching donation model is to encourage the public to participate in donations. According to its original intention, the donation amount including corporate matching should not be used for the donor himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Charity Law also clearly stipulates that when a donor and a charitable organization agree on the purpose and beneficiaries of donated property, the donor&#39;s interested parties shall not be designated as beneficiaries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But Li Shan has never heard of the above regulations. On the eve of the 99 Charity Day in 2023, Li Shan opened a &quot;Donate Together&quot; charity matching donation project for each of the three charity matching projects launched by the Children&#39;s Charity Society: &quot;Sunflower Protects Children in the West&quot;, &quot;Girls in Need Guarantee Plan&quot; and &quot;Aiding Children in Need to Dream of Going to School&quot;. ” fundraising link and named it after his daughter, who has leukemia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Donate Together&quot; is a charity game launched by Tencent Charity Platform. Users click the corresponding button on the public welfare project homepage and fill in the target amount and sponsor information to generate a link. Donors open the link and enter the amount to donate. Subsequently, this donation information and the corresponding matching donation will be recorded in the initiator&#39;s &quot;Donate Together&quot; and can be publicly queried. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to the public information and implementation plan of the project, the recipients of &quot;Sunflower Guarding Children in the West&quot; are children in need in the western provinces under the age of 18. &quot;Girls in Distress&quot; The &quot;Guarantee Plan&quot; will provide long-term assistance to girls in need across the country, and the goal of &quot;Assisting Children in Need to Dream of Going to School&quot; is to allow children in need to go to school with peace of mind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;I really don&#39;t understand this.&quot; On September 17, 2023, Li Shan listened to a reporter from Southern Weekend introduce the above three projects and said that he neither I don’t know who these projects are aiding, and I don’t know whether my behavior counts as a donation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But before that, in the three days from September 7th to 9th, Li Shan raised more than 210,000 yuan for these three projects through &quot;donate together&quot; , including several &quot;donations&quot; worth 3,000 yuan and 4,000 yuan. According to the rules, Tencent will donate more than 22,000 yuan to this end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Shan explained to Southern Weekend reporters that these &quot;donations&quot; were all his own money. &quot;The people who &#39;donated money&#39; were some relatives and friends.

In order to seek medical treatment for his daughter, who has not yet entered elementary school, he claimed to have spent at least 700,000 yuan in two years. He remembers that day, the patient next to him took out 2,000 yuan and asked him to &quot;donate&quot; the link he had opened for him, and at the same time help answer the questions (according to the rules of the platform, those who answer the questions will have a chance to get more matching donations). The patient told him that after doing so, the platform would randomly match an undetermined amount of matching donation, and &quot;after certain procedures,&quot; the patient would not only get the matching donation, but &quot;the principal can also be returned.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the eve of 99 Charity Day in 2023, Li Shan joined a &quot;matching donation group&quot;.

The daily matching donation amount is on a first-come, first-served basis while supplies last. Together with the funds donated by donors, it will be transferred to the donated charity projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But Li Shan’s understanding of “matching donation” is obviously different. &quot;He (the group organizer) told us when to start investing, and then we started donating money.&quot; Li Shan recalled that through mutual communication among patients in the group, he learned that as long as he launched the &quot;Donate Together&quot; fundraising link in the designated project , find someone to donate money and help answer questions, the &quot;teacher&quot; can apply for a &quot;matching donation&quot; for him, and the principal can be returned through &quot;relevant procedures&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Before the start of the 99 Charity Day, the &quot;teacher&quot; announced the &quot;quota&quot; in the group, and he signed up in the group; after signing up, he sent it to his relatives and friends Transfer money; at 10 o&#39;clock on the day of the event, while there is still a matching donation quota, you must &quot;raise it yourself as soon as possible, otherwise you will not be able to vote later and the link is full&quot;; after the event is over, wait for the refund. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Within three days, Li Shan &quot;donated&quot; more than 200,000 yuan to three projects initiated by the Children&#39;s Charity Association. &quot;No parent asked why he donated to these projects. &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Public information of the project shows that a total of 54 people initiated &quot;Donate Together&quot; within three days of &quot;Assisting Children in Distress to Dream of Going to School.&quot; Two years after the project was launched, it has completed its fundraising goal and raised 4.35 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As of press time, &quot;Sunflower Protects Children in the West&quot; has reached the public fundraising goal of 5 million yuan.

Wang Qiang (pseudonym) who once worked in a local team of 9958 said that after the 99 Charity Day, parents would send screenshots of &quot;Donate Together&quot; named after their children to the financial staff of the 9958 local sub-center, who would then make statistics on each donation. How much money did each parent actually invest? The &quot;Donate Together&quot; page will display the funds raised by parents and the amount matched by the platform. The self-raised portion will be returned to parents after the 99 Charity Day. “This is the money in the account of the Children’s Charity Association.” The matching donation portion will have to wait until the platform transfers the matching donation funds to the Children’s Charity Association, “and then through the local people’s charity.” It will not be returned to parents through organizations or other channels.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Qiang also explained to Southern Weekend reporters that when allocating the matching donation amount, parents need to provide the staff with an invoice consistent with the total allocation amount of the foundation, &quot;For example The principal is 50,000, and the matching donation is 20,000. Parents must provide an invoice with a face value of 70,000 to the foundation, otherwise the accounts will not be balanced.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The content of the invoice provided by the parents of the children must be related to the child&#39;s condition. Invoices for hospitalization, outpatient services or purchased medicines are all acceptable.&quot; Wang Qiang further mentioned . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 17, Li Shan said that he had not received the refund yet. After the Ke Mouxiao incident was exposed, he was worried that he would not be able to get back the money he invested. &quot;(The staff) didn&#39;t say when they would give us the money. Before the incident, they said we would submit the child&#39;s information and wait for the foundation (Children&#39;s Charity Society) to give us the money back, but now we are in a panic.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to Southern Metropolis Daily, some parents who have successfully received &quot;matching donations&quot; have presented bank transfer slips, and the payee was the Children&#39;s Charity Association. However, Sun Dandan, director of the platform communication department of the Children’s Charity Society, said that some parents received funds from the Children’s Charity Society not because of “matching donations”, but because they met the rescue standards of the 9958 project, and local teams or rescue stations submitted the funds for their children. If the information and situation are evaluated and meet the rescue standards, the rescue funds will be released according to the rescue process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tencent Charity reported on September 13 that although Ke Mouxiao’s behavior did not occur on the Tencent Charity platform, based on the platform operating rules, industry self-discipline conventions and user-oriented principles, the following was made: Decision: Suspension of fundraising for all 9958 projects pending official investigation results. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;The team calls on parents to donate large amounts&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Does the Children&#39;s Charity Association know about Li Shan&#39;s &quot;matching donations&quot;? A WeChat group communication record obtained by Southern Weekend reporters shows that it was at the call of staff and volunteers that many parents of seriously ill children actively participated in the so-called &quot;matching donations&quot; on the 99 Charity Day in 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This group is called &quot;Core Personnel of the Four National Branch Centers of the Children&#39;s Charity Society Project&quot;, with a maximum number of more than 70 people. The leader of the group is Wang Yu, whose name is the deputy secretary-general of the Children&#39;s Charity Society, Director of the 9958 Rescue Center of the Emergency Rescue Department. Almost all the 9958 project staff shown in the 2022 annual report of the Children&#39;s Charity Association are in the group, in addition to the &quot;responsible persons&quot; of various 9958 local teams. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Emergency Relief Department is also known as Project Department 4. According to the official website of the Children&#39;s Society, the 9958 Children&#39;s Emergency Relief Center is established under it. The 2022 annual report of the Children’s Society shows that the 9958 Rescue Center of the Emergency Rescue Department has 16 staff members, which is the largest department in the Children’s Society. Its 9958 children&#39;s emergency rescue project was established in 2012 and is an independent brand project of the Children&#39;s Charity Association. Over the years, this project has established 25 relief sub-centers across the country in Weinan, Henan, Shanxi, Tai&#39;an, and Shijiazhuang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since August 2023, the staff member whose group nickname is &quot;9958-Cao Lifang&quot; has frequently shared information and reminders related to 99 Charity Day in the group. According to the WeChat public account &quot;9958 Children&#39;s Emergency Rescue&quot; and the 2022 annual report of the Children&#39;s Charity Society, Cao Lifang is the director of the fourth project department of the Children&#39;s Charity Society and also serves as the director of the 9958 Rescue Center. During the 99 Charity Day, he was also the coordinator of the 9958 project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On August 23, Cao Lifang informed the group that &quot;the platform is conducting a donation matching test&quot; and asked staff to make small donations to participating projects and experience the event process. . &quot;It is not recommended to allow parents to participate in the test. It is impossible to determine the amount of parents&#39; investment, which will take up the remaining fundraising space of the project.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On August 29, she said again Reminder, &quot;Participating children should pay attention to whether the disease type is consistent with the project. If the disease type is not specified, the project will treat it as all diseases. If the project specifies autism, premature infants, and congenital heart disease, the team will ask the parents to respond accordingly. Disease type, if the item is for girls, please ask the team to check that boys do not use it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Two days later, she shared with everyone the matching donation for 99 Charity Day Understand the rules. For example, if you need help from friends to answer the question &quot;Whether you answer correctly or not, you will have a chance to get a matching donation,&quot; parents can follow the training materials of the Children&#39;s Charity Association to learn to improve their charity status, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The team can directly call on parents to donate large amounts, and 80% of the donations must be completed on the 7th.&quot; Cao Lifang said in the group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A charity figure who once worked in 9958 explained to Southern Weekend reporters that on the 99 Charity Day, many parents of children with children will invest money in multiple projects. , the platform has a high probability of matching the most funds to the project with the largest donation amount. &quot;A friend can only help the parents of the same seriously ill child once a day, and large donations will get the most matching donations.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 4, Cao Lifang informed everyone in the group: &quot;Parents who participate in 99 Charity, please transfer money to relatives and friends in advance.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Before the matching donation started on September 7, the group nickname was shown as &quot;9958 Platform Development Department-Xu Jiawen&quot; (the annual report showed that this name&#39;s position was &quot;9958 Relief Center Project Officer&quot; ) notified in the group, &quot;Public donation is a voluntary and free act. Please mobilize and regulate management to jointly protect the credibility of the industry.&quot; But more than half an hour later, the group nickname was &quot;Jia Zhen, 9958 Platform Development Department&quot;. Said, &quot;Parents with high allocation should hurry up.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The above-mentioned charity person explained that &quot;high allocation&quot; refers to the platform&#39;s matching donation ratio on that day is relatively high. &quot;Hurry up.&quot; &quot;Reduce&quot; is because after the matching donation starts, the amount of matching donation will be smaller as the time goes by, until the matching donation quota for the day is completely used up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At around 19:00 on September 7, &quot;9958 Platform Development Department-Xu Jiawen&quot; released statistical results in the group. On that day, the fourth project raised more than 82.44 million yuan and received allocation. Donated more than 5.61 million yuan. The Shijiazhuang team raised a total of more than 29.64 million yuan (including 1.82 million yuan in matching donations), ranking first among the 17 local teams; the Tai&#39;an team raised a total of 19.51 million yuan (including 1.16 million yuan in matching donations), ranking second. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 23, Southern Weekend reporters called the mobile phone numbers reserved by Cao Lifang and Jia Zhen on the public platform, but no one answered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/6e635b278e.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;717&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/6e635b278e.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251853&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 7, 2023, the fundraising rankings of various local teams were released in the &quot;Core Personnel of the National Branch Centers of the Four National Branches of the Children&#39;s Charity Project&quot; group. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; Volunteers&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”, execution fees, fundraising rankings&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;More than 80 million yuan raised in one day, confirming the success of Erci In recent years, it has left people with the impression that it has super fundraising capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Public financial reports show that 714 million yuan in donations will flow into the Children&#39;s Charity Association in 2022; this number will be 838 million yuan in 2021 and 838 million yuan in 2020. It’s 834 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Among them, 9958, as the star project of the Children’s Charity Society, has generated revenue of 322 million yuan (2020), 262 million yuan (2021) and 262 million yuan respectively in the past three years. 227 million yuan (2022), accounting for about one-third of the total annual revenue of the Children&#39;s Charity Association. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, public data does not show how much of the annual fundraising of the Children&#39;s Charity Association is strictly public donation, and how much is for matching donations. self-donated for personal use. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Tencent Charity Regulations in 2023 stipulate that during the 99 Charity Days, fundraising organizations can use 20% of the income matching donations for the operation and development of the organization. This means that the higher the amount raised by an organization, the more matching donations it will receive from the platform, and the more incentives it will ultimately receive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, during periods other than matching donations, each fundraising organization can receive up to 2 million yuan in unrestricted donations as incentives. This part of the incentive payment is first come, first served, and the institution does not have to use it for project execution. At around 15:30 on September 7, Xu Jiawen informed everyone in the group: &quot;The backstage non-matching rewards have reached 2 million (ten thousand), and no new incentives will be obtained.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During this matching donation controversy, The Children&#39;s Charity Association stated that it has never entrusted Ke Mouxiao to personally raise funds for the 9958 project. Ke Mouxiao is not a staff member of the association, but a volunteer of the 9958 Langfang team cooperation organization. However, Wang Qiang and the above-mentioned charity people said that this kind of personnel cooperation mechanism is common in the Children&#39;s Charity Society. Many people who organize fund-raising in the name of &quot;9958 staff&quot; are not official staff of the Children&#39;s Charity Society, but they are raising funds He has greater authority and is also under pressure to raise funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Qiang told Southern Weekend reporters that after he joined a local 9958 team as a staff member, he did not sign a labor or labor contract with the Children&#39;s Benevolent Society or the local 9958 rescue center. He said that his usual salary is paid by local non-governmental organizations or enterprises, and the same is true for his colleagues around him. In a sense, Wang Qiang&#39;s identity is the same as Ke Mouxiao, and he is also a &quot;volunteer&quot;, but in external publicity, he is called the operations specialist of the 9958 team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Wang Qiang cannot be considered a volunteer in the strict sense. According to the &quot;Volunteer Service Regulations&quot;, volunteer services should follow the principle of free payment. Some legal scholars once suggested that the behavior of raising funds for patients and collecting execution fees is more like the professional fundraisers commonly seen in foreign charitable relief. It is only because the current domestic fundraising system is imperfect that all parties call this group &quot;volunteers&quot; &quot;. (For details, see Southern Weekend’s report &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/contents/203083&quot;>;Suspicions about “matching donations” among “fundraising volunteers”&lt;/a>;”)&lt;/p>; &lt; p>; During the several years of working in 9958, Wang Qiang felt that he was &quot;like a businessman.&quot; If you only do your job, your monthly income will not exceed 4,000 yuan. If you want a higher income, you need to find more families with seriously ill children and help them raise funds publicly on several Internet platforms as &quot;volunteers.&quot; Wang Qiang described the fundraising link as an &quot;online project&quot; and claimed that he could get an execution fee of 3% or more of the total fundraising amount, but he did not produce a transfer voucher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with public donations without specific beneficiaries, parents of seriously ill children have a stronger motivation to raise funds and can help &quot;volunteers&quot; reach their fundraising goals faster. In fact, Ke Mouxiao himself may be a parent of children with serious illnesses. Information about his fundraising for children with blood cancer in 2021 can be found on the Internet, as well as bank statement receipts in which he is the payee and a charity organization is the payer. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Some parents are so pitiful that they will kneel down and beg you for a fundraising project.&quot; Wang Qiang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Even different teams will compete for &quot;business&quot;. The aforementioned charity worker who worked at 9958 told Southern Weekend reporters that he had previously worked with a seriously ill child in a cancer hospital and had collected the child’s information and was preparing to take photos of the child, write fundraising copy, and upload it to the Internet the next day. , &quot;As a result, the parents refused to let me take the photo the next day, and asked me for a letter of authorization (for the agency) to publicly use the child&#39;s photos before I left. Later I found out that someone from another team had snatched the child away.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;9958 will also conduct internal team fundraising rankings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On August 20, 2023, the group nickname was &quot;9958 New Media~Sun Shuo&quot; (the annual report showed that the name and position were &quot;9958 Rescue Center&quot; &quot;Project Officer&quot;) published in the work group the ranking of the amount of funds raised by teams from various regions on the Kuaishou platform from August 11 to August 18: the Beijing team raised 51,000 yuan, the Guiyang team raised 5,320 yuan, and the Anhui team raised 5,320 yuan.

Xu Jiawen reported the data of the 9958 project in the group over the past three days: the total fundraising received in the three days exceeded 134 million yuan, and the total matching donations received exceeded 11.81 million yuan. She also attached a ranking chart of the total fundraising of each local team from high to low: the Shijiazhuang team ranked first, raising more than 36.4 million yuan; the Tai&#39;an team ranked second, raising more than 28.04 million yuan; the Weinan team ranked third, Raising more than 27.36 million yuan; Shanxi team ranked fourth, raising more than 20.74 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Thank you to all the teachers for their efforts during the event.

According to regulations, it needs to be disclosed, but it is open to the public. To varying degrees. The death of female college student Wu Huayan in 2020 once plunged 9958 into controversy over insufficient information disclosure and over-age rescue. (For details, see Southern Weekend’s report &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/contents/174760?source=131&quot;>;&quot;Wu Huayan&#39;s death&quot; triggers reflection by public welfare individuals&lt;/a>;&quot;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The disclosure of vague project information has created convenience for donations and matching funds to return to the hands of Li Shan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Take the projects Li Shan participated in as an example.

For example, medical assistance projects should disclose the list of recipients, types of diseases, and information about medical institutions. and rescue standards. However, there are contradictions between the existing public information of &quot;School Dream&quot; and its own purpose of assistance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The project introduction states, &quot;A donation of 10 yuan can support a child to buy a set of school supplies. A donation of 50 yuan can support part of a child&#39;s living expenses. &quot;.

In June, October and December, the Children&#39;s Association will realize the dream in Tai&#39;an City The Public Welfare Development Center (referred to as Tai&#39;an Dream Realization) allocated 3.39 million yuan, 1.63 million yuan, and 270,000 yuan respectively, and indicated that nearly 1.292 million yuan came from the &quot;School Dream&quot; project. The 2022 audit report of the Chinese Children&#39;s Charity Society also shows that Tai&#39;an Yuanmeng, as a &quot;large payment object&quot;, received a rescue activity fee of 1.287 million yuan from the Chinese Children&#39;s Charity Society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, the executor of the public introduction of &quot;School Dream&quot; is the 9958 Beijing Xiangyang Group Rescue Center, and Southern Weekend reporters did not find that Tai&#39;an Yuanmeng has a public business relationship with it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The invoice information sent to Tai&#39;an Yuanmeng by Children&#39;s Charity Society shows that the reviewer and payee of Tai&#39;an Yuanmeng are both Li Mengmeng.

According to the content released by the 9958 WeChat public account, the above two people are also the directors of the 9958 Tai&#39;an team.

If she is familiar with the situation in Tai&#39;an, she can implement it more efficiently locally.&quot; Zhou Zaoying said. But from a pessimistic perspective, “Insufficient and difficult-to-explain information about projects may lead to a crisis of public trust in the public welfare industry.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/7a90c82ab7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;665&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/7a90c82ab7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251854&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The invoice shows that in June 2022, the Children&#39;s Charity Association allocated 3.39 million yuan to Tai&#39;an Dream.

If parents invest money in public welfare projects on the premise of returning donations and obtaining matching donation funds, it is not even a donation.&quot; Legal Research and Services of Shanghai Fulen Social Organization Lu Xuan, chairman of the center, explained to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some people believe that some parents of seriously ill children are also in need of public welfare assistance, and it is understandable to obtain matching donation funds through self-donation. But Lu Xuan doesn&#39;t see it that way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Very bad.&quot; Lu Xuan analyzed that the public welfare nature of a charity organization determines that its mission is to help unspecified objects in society. If project staff encourage parents of seriously ill children to donate money to the project before arranging allocations, it will become a &quot;specific target&quot; to be helped. In addition to constituting a donation arbitrage that violates the principle of good faith, it also violates the public welfare nature of a charitable organization. The principles of “openness, fairness and impartiality” that should be followed in the selection of project beneficiaries that do not comply with the Charity Law. This may prevent the needy people who are more in need of assistance from receiving relief funds, and also detract from the overall social evaluation of the charitable organization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Ma Jianyin, associate professor at Beijing Normal University Law School, also does not believe that the behavior of &quot;first investing money in public welfare projects and then taking money from the foundation&quot; is a donation. &quot;This is a false donation made to obtain matching donations. If the evidence chain is complete, it is a kind of &#39;fraudulent donation&#39;.&quot; Ma Jianyin analyzed that the deceived in this behavior are the main ones who use funds to make matching donations. &quot;They You can hold the organizer accountable or report it to the civil affairs department.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Parents of seriously ill children who need help from public welfare organizations often have limited income and do not have the strength to do so. Strong social ties may be to vulnerable groups in society. A legal expert who studies social organizations analyzed to a reporter from Southern Weekend that if this group learns that they can make &quot;donations&quot; through organizations, they will have a very strong motivation to participate, &quot;because they will feel that they are the beneficiaries.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But this kind of behavior will hurt more potential targets who also need help, and deprive other disadvantaged groups of the public support that may belong to them. In addition, it will also make it difficult for public welfare organizations that are already lacking in resources to develop. The industry generally calls for separation of fundraising and use in charity fundraising. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 4, 2023, Cao Lifang sent a document called &quot;Children’s Association 99 Charity Day Self-Discipline Convention&quot; to the above-mentioned work group. Each team leader was also required to sign and fingerprint. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Article 7 of this self-discipline convention states, &quot;Put an end to any form of extortion of matching donations.&quot; If there is any violation, &quot;I will bear all the responsibilities and consequences arising therefrom and accept all the handling of this matter by the Chinese Children&#39;s Benefit Association.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;With the issuance of internal regulations, does the organization no longer have management responsibilities?&quot; Lu Xuan analyzed that even if the staff of the local teams do not have direct labor or employment with 9958, Labor relations, but these people have actually provided services to 9958. Through the exchange of funds between institutions, it can be proved that there is a certain contractual relationship between several entities. &quot;If the local team of 9958 makes a mistake, it doesn&#39;t make sense for the local team to take responsibility in the end.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 24 Sep 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[从寻找F-35战机，看失事战机“僵尸飞行”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257548]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-24 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On the evening of September 18, 2023, local time, after an intensive 28-hour search, the U.S. military The wreckage of a previously missing F35B fighter jet was found in a field northeast of Joint Base Charleston, South Carolina. Aerial videos circulated on social platforms showed that there was a large area of ​​charred land on the field, and the woods on one side were in a mess. A large number of trees were knocked down, and there were obvious signs of excessive fire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The day before, an F-35B &quot;Lightning&quot; II Joint Strike Fighter had an accident during a routine exercise. The pilot chose to eject to escape in an emergency. After that, the fighter jet continued flying in a &quot;zombie state&quot; and lost contact over South Carolina. In order to recover the missing F-35B fighter jet, multiple U.S. military services and departments jointly launched a &quot;missing notice&quot; on social media to solicit clues from the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A bizarre incident involving a large-scale search for fighter jets has sparked heated discussions on the Internet, with many people finding it unbelievable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;South Carolina Congresswoman Nancy Mace asked on social media: &quot;What happened? How did you lose an F-35? Why is there no tracking equipment? You have to ask the public to help find it. Fighters and turn them in?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Air force training bases are generally established in the suburbs of cities, and radar deployment cannot be comprehensive. When the aircraft stalls and is at a lower flying altitude, it is not uncommon for the radar to fail to detect the target. More What&#39;s more, the F-35B fighter jet has excellent stealth capabilities and its radar reflection surface is extremely small.&quot; Wang Qunhuai, a former naval officer, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, it is not unprecedented for fighter jets to fly away without pilots. There have been fighter jets that flew nearly a thousand kilometers long distances after losing control of the pilot, until they ran out of fuel and crashed in a foreign country. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Where did the fighter jet go?&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;If you have any clues that can help us find the F-35 fighter jet, please call the Base Defense Operations Center. &quot;On September 18, 2023 local time, the United States Joint Base Charleston released an &quot;Opportunity Notice&quot; on social platforms, which attracted public attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The missing fighter belongs to the 501st Fighter Attack Training Squadron of the 2nd Air Wing of the U.S. Marine Corps, which is mainly responsible for pilot training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon of September 17, a US military pilot flew an F-35B &quot;Lightning&quot; II fighter jet and took off from Joint Base Charleston to perform a training mission. But not long after, the fighter plane suddenly had an accident, and the pilot chose to eject to escape at a critical moment. At about 2 p.m., the pilot landed safely in the Charleston community and was later taken to the hospital, but the whereabouts of the F-35B he was flying was unknown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A spokesman for Joint Base Charleston told NBC that after the pilot ejected, the fighter jet was in autopilot mode, complicating tracking. Agence France-Presse reported that the fighter jet will continue to fly in a so-called &quot;zombie state&quot; until it crashes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that an F-35 fighter plane was accompanying the flight at the time of the incident. But the pilot did not continue to follow the drone and chose to return to base. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the fighter plane disappeared, the U.S. military quickly joined forces with the Marine Corps, Navy, FAA, Civil Air Patrol and local law enforcement agencies in South Carolina to surround Moore, north of North Charleston. A three-dimensional search was conducted from the air and on the ground in the area of ​​Terry Lake and Marion Lake. In the evening of September 18, several search aircraft circled an area of ​​woods and farmland near the town of Starkey in Williamsburg County. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a day and night of searching, a spokesperson for the U.S. Marine Corps confirmed that the wreckage of the F-35B fighter jet was found in a field in Williamsburg County. The crash site is about 129 kilometers from Joint Base Charleston. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The F-35B combines many advantages such as stealth, short takeoff, and vertical landing, and has a high level of versatility and interoperability. It is one of the most advanced and popular fighter jets in the world. &quot;Shepard Media, a well-known British defense media website, commented. But it is such an advanced fighter plane that is known as the &quot;main killer of future air combat&quot;, but it has set off an Internet group ridicule in the United States of &quot;Where have the fighters gone?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;ABC News contributor and retired colonel Steve Ganyard complained, &quot;Even though it is a stealth aircraft, it is really surprising that such an expensive and complex aircraft can disappear. Ridiculous.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It is not as easy for radar to capture stealth fighters as people think.&quot; Wang Qunhuai pointed out that on the one hand, the air warning radar has a high elevation angle, and the electromagnetic waves emitted basically propagate in a straight line. It can be effectively identified only when it flies to a high enough altitude; on the other hand, the F-35B fighter&#39;s maximum flight speed can reach up to thousands of kilometers per hour, and it can fly hundreds of kilometers in a few minutes. Once the transponder loses its function, it is basically invisible to the radar. You can only search with your naked eyes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The F-35 fighter jet is equipped with a Longbo lens. Wang Qunhuai said that this is to deliberately increase the reflected signal and make it easier to be detected by air traffic control radar when landing. &quot;Of course, when stealth flight is required, the Longbo lens The lens will be retracted”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, the U.S. military considers the accident to be a Class A accident, the highest level of severity, but has not revealed the name of the pilot involved or the cause of the accident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, this is not the first time that an F35-B fighter jet has suffered a Class A accident. Four months ago, an F-35B fighter jet of the US military stationed in Japan had parts falling off during flight training, and the fighter jet subsequently returned to the Iwakuni base. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;MiG-23 across Europe&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The mysterious disappearance of advanced fighter jets is surprising, but this is not the first time in history. The &quot;zombie flight&quot; experience of the MiG-23 fighter more than thirty years ago is more legendary than the F-35B. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1989, the Berlin Wall still stood high between East and West Germany, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, headed by the United States, and the Warsaw Pact, headed by the Soviet Union, were in a tense confrontation in Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to public records, on the morning of July 4th, Colonel Nikolay Skuridin, who had just finished his vacation, boarded a MiG-23 fighter jet as usual and flew from near Kołobrzeg, Poland. Take off from Bagiz Air Base. For this experienced pilot, this was just an extremely ordinary flight training. He did not expect that this day would be recorded in the history of world aviation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Skuridin piloted the plane to climb to an altitude of 150 meters, he suddenly found that the thrust of the engine afterburner had dropped sharply. When he realized that the plane had begun to fall, Skuridin immediately reported it to the ground command center. Engine failure problem. After receiving the tower&#39;s instruction to abandon the aircraft and parachute, he decisively pressed the emergency canopy ejection button. The MiG-23 fighter canopy detached from the fuselage, and Skuridin was safely ejected from the cockpit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unexpectedly, the unmanned MiG-23 fighter jet did not die in the Baltic Sea as expected. Instead, it suddenly raised its head and climbed upwards under the action of ejection, and soon resumed normal flight. gesture, flying westward over northern Poland and across what was then the Democratic Republic of Germany (East Germany). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the air defense radar stationed in Poland recognized the fighter plane, it mistakenly thought it was a routine training and its flight trajectory was not interfered with. In less than half an hour, the MiG-23 fighter jet entered the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and was detected by the NATO warning radar deployed in Hamburg. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After receiving the alert, the NATO military command urgently dispatched two American F-15 fighter jets stationed in the Netherlands to intercept. Compared with the US fighter jets, which were waiting in a tight formation, this MiG-23 fighter did not make any evasive maneuvers and maintained its current speed and flew smoothly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When American pilots who were ready for air combat approached the MiG-23 fighter, they found that the fighter had no canopy, no pilot, and no ammunition. As a result, the NATO military command lifted the interception order and ordered two F-15 fighters to follow the MiG-23 fighters. Subsequently, the MiG-23 fighter jet flew westward through Dutch airspace and entered Belgium. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At 10:30 a.m. local time, 80 kilometers away from the Belgian capital, a MiG-23 fighter jet that ran out of fuel crashed into a house in the town of Kortrijk-Belleheim in western Belgium. Wim Dral, a 19-year-old boy who was sleeping, died. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this time, the Soviet Union was looking for the wreckage of MiG-23 fighter jets in the Baltic Sea. It wasn&#39;t until they saw reports from Western media that the Soviet Union knew that its fighter jets continued to fly unpiloted for 79 minutes, traveling more than 900 kilometers across Poland, the Democratic Republic of Germany, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium, and finally landed in Belgium. crashed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 6, Belgium protested to the Soviet Union over the plane crash. In the end, the Soviet Union paid approximately 625,000 euros in compensation to Belgium, most of which went to Dral&#39;s family. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Cornfield Bomber&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&quot; Jedi encounter&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;生&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Dayton, Ohio, USA, is the hometown of the Wright brothers, the inventors of the aircraft. It is home to the U.S. Air Force Museum, the oldest and largest military aviation museum in the world. According to the official website, the museum houses about 400 aerospace vehicles dating back to World War I. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the various aircraft on display at the U.S. Air Force Museum, one of the F-106 fighter jets with a large delta wing design and a wasp-waisted fuselage does not seem to be conspicuous. But the legendary experience of its aftermath has been passed down orally from generation to generation of American pilots. They regarded it as a lucky fighter and affectionately called it the &quot;Cornfield Bomber.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 2, 1970, pilot Lieutenant Gary Foster took off in the F-106 fighter jet with tail number 580787. At the same time, three other F-106s took off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a routine tactical confrontation training that took place at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, USA. According to the original plan, Lieutenant Foster will form a team with one of the pilots and conduct a peer-to-peer air combat exercise with two other F-106 fighters. However, due to a problem with the drag chute of one of the aircraft, the originally scheduled two-aircraft confrontation project turned into a &quot;one-on-two&quot; &quot;battle.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But when Lieutenant Foster piloted the F-106 fighter jet to an altitude of 10,000 meters, the fighter suddenly stalled and fell into an extremely dangerous horizontal rotation state, and then rapidly dropped to an altitude of about 3,657 meters. Foster attempted the spin recovery procedure multiple times without success before ejecting himself from the cockpit of the aircraft. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the weight reduction of the fighter plane after the pilot ejected, the center of gravity changed, and the explosive force of the seat rushing out of the plane pushed the nose of the plane downwards. The F-106 fighter jet got rid of the rotation and flew without warning. Under human control, it enters a stable gliding state and flies smoothly in a straight line at a speed of more than 300 kilometers per hour. And this is exactly the approach speed of the F-106 fighter jet for landing under normal conditions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Foster, hanging on the parachute, could only watch as his plane flew further and further away. He then landed in a nearby mountainous area and was rescued &lt;span>;by a local resident using a snowmobile&lt;/span>;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The F-106 fighter jet he was flying landed safely in a cornfield near Big Sandy, Montana after flying for a certain distance. It even perfectly avoided the center of the field during taxiing. Rock pile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the local police arrived at the landing site, the aircraft engine was still running normally and the radar was still scanning. One hour and forty-five minutes later, the F-106 fighter ran out of fuel and the engine automatically shut down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, technicians from the Logistics Center at McClellan Air Force Base in California arrived at the scene. They were surprised to find that except for a few meters of scratches on the belly of the aircraft, the damage to the entire fighter jet was minimal. One rescue official even said that if the damage was less serious, he would fly the fighter directly back to the base. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Wang Qunhuai&#39;s view, it is a rare thing for a manned fighter plane to land on its own without human control, and it is basically difficult to achieve. &quot;Aircraft landing is one of the most dangerous aspects of flight. It requires deceleration and descent to maintain the appropriate speed and altitude. The attitude and thrust of the fuselage must also be adjusted to adapt to the runway position and airflow conditions. If there is a problem in any aspect, it may Posing a threat to the landing of aircraft.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the &quot;War History Online&quot; website stated that the thick snow on the ground provided a buffer for the fighter planes to land lightly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the F-106 fighter was transported back to California, Air Force staff repaired it, and the fighter was subsequently put back into service. In 1979, Foster flew this fighter into the sky again to participate in training at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 1986, this F-106 fighter aircraft numbered 580787 was retired and subsequently donated to the U.S. Air Force Museum. A few years later, all F-106 fighter jets were retired from the U.S. military and completely bid farewell to the stage of history at the beginning of the 21st century. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 24 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[超“潮”！杭州亚运会开幕式的中式浪漫细节]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257519]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-24 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The evening of September 23&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The opening ceremony of the 19th Asian Games&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Held in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/254915ccf2ad57ad9fd7a8bf4127acda.jpeg&quot; border=&quot; 0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/254915ccf2ad57ad9fd7a8bf4127acda.jpeg&quot; data -key=&quot;251769&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The opening ceremony was themed &quot;Tide Asia&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Presenting an epic picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https: //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/d8965edd72e7460a1ad6640a1a391f41.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;998&quot; height=&quot;516&quot; data-src =&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/d8965edd72e7460a1ad6640a1a391f41.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251767&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What are the romantic Chinese details at the opening ceremony? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let’s take a look↓↓&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The five-star red flag and the beautiful rivers and mountains are in the same frame&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the opening ceremony, the five-star red flag entered the scene&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/113dfe346ea641241d9d713533e00e6b.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;753&quot; height= &quot;424&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/113dfe346ea641241d9d713533e00e6b.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;251772&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dang Mei The rivers and mountains and the five-star red flag are stunningly framed together&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This scene is absolutely beautiful! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/21b1af400cf0fb531b1befc20cf1c3bc.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;751&quot; height=&quot;422&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/21b1af400cf0fb531b1befc20cf1c3bc.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;251770&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;The whole place was excited!

Zhang Xinyang is 28 years old. After graduating with a doctorate, he worked as an external teacher at Ningxia Normal University. He resigned in August 2021. He is currently working on projects with friends to earn money. He said that he currently only has a few thousand yuan on his card. In the eyes of many people, this does not match his &quot;prodigy&quot; persona. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The video begins with a splice of two paragraphs. The first paragraph is what he said to his parents when he was 16: &quot;It was you who wanted me to stay in Beijing the most. You should work hard for this (buying a house).&quot; The second paragraph is that he now says, &quot;I am already very satisfied in life and have no desires. If I really need anything, I can just call my dad. They still owe me a house in Beijing. It should be worth more than 10 million now, (Reporter: Are they willing to give it to you?) So what if you don’t want to, you have to be willing if you don’t want to.” Then he grinned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The intention of the splicing is somewhat obvious. Sure enough, after reading it, many people criticized Zhang Xinyang&#39;s remarks and values. As the discussion deepened, more and more people discovered that there were many secrets to the matter, and they felt more sympathy and regret for him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the interview, the reporter asked him if he was a child prodigy. He said no and seemed very humble. However, the reporter asked him what his IQ was like and how it compared with Wei Shen and Liu Jiyu. He said it was around 140, &quot;should be at the same level, slightly lower than them.&quot; He was still very confident in his intelligence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is Zhang Xinyang a child prodigy? I think so. He showed extraordinary intellectual talent since he was a child, and then continued to skip grades. He was admitted to university at the age of 10, but his test scores could only pass two books. And his father seems to have an obsession. He wants to prove that his son is a child prodigy, and he wants his son to maintain his character as a child prodigy. He actually did not allow him to repeat the above 985 university. It seems that if he went to college a year later, the glory of the child prodigy would be dimmed. , this character cannot be saved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reporter asked &quot;If you had not taken the college entrance examination at such a young age, would it be possible for you to get into Tsinghua University and Peking University?&quot; He replied, &quot;It is unlikely, precisely because according to my intelligence, even in an ideal world Under the current situation, there is a high probability that it is a 985 university.&quot; This answer is very modest. If he waits a few years later to take the college entrance examination when his mind is more mature, it would be possible to get into Tsinghua University and Peking University, or it would be a good choice to go to the junior class of the University of Science and Technology of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, in this way, you can make your knowledge system more complete and solid, and you can do better in the exam. Secondly, people with high IQ can be much better than their peers in terms of knowledge. However, their understanding of world affairs and human nature and social survival skills generally cannot be learned in advance and can only be gradually improved with age. This is not only important for interpersonal relationships. Relationships are crucial to personal mental health, and they are not irrelevant to the college entrance examination. For example, you need to have this understanding to write a good college entrance examination essay. No matter how high the IQ of a 10-year-old child is, the degree of socialization is incomparable with that of other 18-year-old classmates. It is difficult to write a high-scoring essay. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xinyang went to college at the age of 10, and went to Tianjin Engineer College; when he was 13, he went to Beijing University of Technology for his master&#39;s degree; and when he was 16, he went to Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics for his doctorate. The undergraduate school was very responsible and focused on cultivating him. The tutor helped him contact a German school to study for graduate school. “They may be better at cultivating geniuses than us.” Because German schools stipulate that 14-year-olds can go to school alone. “We advised him to &quot;Father (wait one year)&quot;, but it seems that in his father&#39;s opinion, waiting one year will disqualify the child prodigy, and insisted that he should go directly to graduate school after his junior year. Just imagine, if Zhang Xinyang went to Germany when he was 14 years old, his life path would be completely different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, he asked his parents to buy a house and studied for a doctorate at the age of 16. In 2011, his father asked him to stay in Beijing after graduation, so he asked his parents to buy a house instead. &quot;Originally, he wanted me to stay in Beijing the most. You, you should work hard for this (buying a house)&quot; caused an uproar in the public opinion. Everyone thought that a genius&#39;s ideological level was so low. Saying this reflects that Zhang Xinyang&#39;s understanding of human nature is not as good as his intelligence. Making counter-requests was actually a form of rebellion against his father&#39;s excessive control over his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, the backlash, rebellion and backlash against my father’s actions have been out of control, and it took me 8 years to complete my PhD. If he had enough motivation, he might have finished reading it long ago. His resentment towards his father and his mentality of giving up and lying down made him lose the motivation to make progress. This is Zhang Xinyang&#39;s own tragedy and the tragedy of his family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, Zhang Xinyang said this: &quot;Twelve years ago, I was keen on the household registration house in Beijing, but now it is completely the opposite, that is, I have no idea of ​​buying a house at all. Is it not good to have no job, no house and no mortgage? Do you think that because the name on the house book belongs to you, this house is really your home?&quot; The flat and angry mentality is clearly visible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the interview, he complained about his father&#39;s extreme control over him and expressed how he would raise his children in the future: &quot;I don&#39;t want children easily. Once I decide to have children, I will support them throughout my life. As long as they do not violate national laws, he will You can do whatever you want to do. If he strongly expresses what I did at that time, then I will let him take this path.&quot; This is not so much a look into the future, but an indictment of his father and his mind. A portrait of an ideal father. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Yaohui, Zhang Xinyang’s doctoral supervisor, once said: Zhang Xinyang is indeed the best among his students, but he entered school too quickly, resulting in that his mind and psychology are not very mature. If he can determine If you are determined to learn and work hard in a certain field, you will definitely achieve great achievements in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Yaohui felt that Zhang Xinyang had suffered too many setbacks, and felt pity for him, and gave him a piece of advice: &quot;At this age, you can no longer hesitate and make decisions about what to do. If you don&#39;t do anything else, just do (mathematics) ) This big problem has been solved. If you run out of talents, you can go into business, and maybe you can make a career. Don’t just lie down.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem is that Zhang Xinyang’s super high IQ is still there , but the enthusiasm is gone. Humans are animals of meaning. Without spirit, it is like losing their soul. I hope that Zhang Xinyang can let go of all the misfortunes of the past, find the meaning of his existence, and re-energize his strong motivation to make a difference without wasting his talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, I also hope that parents all over the world will give their children the space to grow freely and be wary of that kind of pathological control. Whether a child is a genius or a human being, every child has a purpose for coming into this world. Don’t interfere or manipulate too much. Only in this way can the child&#39;s personality and soul be protected from harm and shine with the beauty they deserve. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 24 Sep 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[模特踩八仙桌拍宣传照惹争议，涉事方道歉]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257499]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-24 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;Recently&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“Shenzhen fashion is powerful &quot;The project team&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;released a set of promotional photos&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;However, this set of photos caused a stir&lt;/span>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many netizens are strongly dissatisfied&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The organizers of the project have encountered a wave of dissatisfaction&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span >;Unexpected public opinion storm&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Recently, a set of promotional photos released by the &quot;Shenzhen Fashion Power&quot; project team caused Netizens are hotly discussing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/23/0a2a397842c44445b0c68ed2aabf0bf7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;661&quot; height=&quot;956&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/23/0a2a397842c44445b0c68ed2aabf0bf7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251734 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the photo, &quot;the model stepped on the Eight Immortals Table of the Chaoshan Ancestral Hall to take a promotional photo&quot;, which aroused dissatisfaction among netizens, and the related topic once became a hot search topic on Weibo. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/23/0c87c834990b8752664db9a4bc014209.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;326&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/23/0c87c834990b8752664db9a4bc014209.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251735 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many Chaoshan netizens said that this is an ancestral hall where Chaoshan people recall their ancestral merits and unite the people of the clan.

They are halls and places for worshiping ancestors, worshiping gods, or establishing images of meritorious sages. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Ancestral halls first appeared in the Warring States Period. In the Han Dynasty, they were only tomb temples. From the Wei and Jin Dynasties to the Sui and Tang Dynasties, family ancestral halls appeared in the Song Dynasty, and after the Yuan Dynasty, ancestral halls for worshiping ancestors appeared. Ancestral halls are common throughout our country. As temples of blood worship, they have a long history and an indelible status. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>; Deeply influenced by Chinese traditional culture, there is also an obvious clan tradition in the Chaoshan area. Throughout the ages, Chaoshan people have built a large number of ancestral halls, which is the Chaoshan people&#39;s &quot;return to the original&quot; heart. The expression of &quot;respecting ancestors and respecting ancestors&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;There are many ancestral halls in Chaoshan area, including private ancestral halls, ancestral halls, family temples, and ancestral halls of famous sages and officials, represented by Hanwengong ancestral hall, distributed in four villages and six miles. An ancestral hall has a history, a culture, feelings, and rich and colorful stories. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The architecture, stone carvings, Chaozhou wood carvings, porcelain inlays and other crafts of Chaoshan ancestral halls are exquisite and exquisite. The genealogy and family history carried in the ancestral halls are closely related to the Chaoshan ethnic groups. In the hearts of tens of millions of Chaoshan people around the world, Chaoshan Ancestral Hall is the most important spiritual holy place to &quot;remember nostalgia&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;What is the &quot;Eight Immortals Table&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The Eight Immortals Table is also called the Square Table.

For children, childhood without snacks is bleak, and for adults, life without snacks is incomplete. Simply put, snacks are all foods other than meals. On September 15, 2023, a study published in the &quot;European Journal of Nutrition&quot; pointed out that unhealthy snacks are counteracting the effect of healthy meals, thereby increasing the risk of obesity, stroke, cardiovascular and other diseases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A research team from King&#39;s College London in the UK studied the snacking habits of 854 people and came to two-quarter conclusions. A quarter of people&#39;s daily energy intake comes from snacks, but a quarter of people offset the benefits of a healthy meal with unhealthy snacks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Overall, the UK is a country that loves snacking, with 24% of people’s daily energy intake coming from snacks such as cereal bars, pastries and fruits. Snack eaters (95%) eat an average of 2.28 snacks per day, of which 47% eat two snacks per day and 29% eat more than two snacks per day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A quarter (26%) of those who took part in the study reported eating healthy meals but poor quality snacks such as biscuits, crisps and cakes. Just cancel out their healthy meals. The so-called healthy meals refer to foods recommended according to dietary guidelines, such as a balanced diet based on cereals. The daily meal should include cereals and potatoes, vegetables and fruits, livestock, poultry, fish, eggs, milk and legumes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unhealthy (poor quality) snacks are highly processed and sugary snacks. The classification of snacks is now roughly divided into original product snacks, initially processed snacks and deeply processed snacks. The first two are healthy snacks and the latter are unhealthy snacks. Take the potato chips that Westerners like to eat as an example. If they are cooked potatoes or potato chips with a little salt, they are original and primarily processed snacks. If they are fried and baked with various seasonings and made into potato chips, they are deeply processed snacks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although highly processed snacks account for only 1/3 of the average person’s daily food intake, their impact on the body can offset healthy meals, resulting in higher body mass index (BMI) and higher visceral fat. and higher triglyceride concentrations, all of which are associated with metabolic diseases such as obesity, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. This is a classic example of bad money beating good money when it comes to nutrition and health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Brits, popular snacks are biscuits, fruit, nuts and seeds, cheese and butter, cakes and pies, granola or cereal bars. Among them, unhealthy foods are cakes, cookies, pies, donuts, pastries, candies, ice cream and frozen dairy desserts, while nuts and seeds are among the healthier snacks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chinese people also like to eat snacks. In 2018, the &quot;Report on the Development of the Snack Industry in the Context of Consumption Upgrading&quot; released by the Ministry of Commerce of China pointed out that the total annual output value of China&#39;s snack industry has reached 2.21564 billion yuan. Although in recent years, snack manufacturers and sellers have promoted natural, whole grain, sugar-free, and additive-free snacks as popular labels for healthy snacks, unhealthy snacks are still flooding the market, including fried foods and pickled foods. , processed meat products (dried meat, floss, sausage, ham, etc.), biscuit foods (including all processed biscuits), soda and cola drinks, convenience foods (mainly instant noodles and puffed foods), canned foods, plums Candied fruit foods, frozen dessert foods (ice cream, popsicles, ice cream, etc.), barbecue foods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Spice strips, a famous Chinese snack that is widely loved by people at home and abroad, is an unhealthy snack (famous diver Quan Hongchan said that she likes spicy strips the most, and some manufacturers even sent her snacks. A cart of spicy strips). This is a type of cooked food product close to gluten type. It is made from wheat flour and/or other cereal flours as raw materials, added with salt, oil and other auxiliary materials, and processed through ingredients, extrusion cooking, molding, seasoning, packaging and other processes. There are less than 10 kinds of ingredients, but more than 10 kinds of food additives, and some even 20 kinds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This snack is high in oil and salt. A pack of spicy strips has a net content of 100 grams, of which fat accounts for 25 grams. According to the recommendations of the &quot;Dietary Guidelines for Chinese Residents&quot;, the average daily edible oil intake per person is 25-30 grams. The oil content in a pack of spicy strips is equivalent to people&#39;s daily fat intake. At the same time, a pack of spicy strips contains 7.3 grams of salt. Also according to the guidelines, the daily salt intake of healthy adults should not exceed 6 grams, children aged 2-3 should not exceed 2 grams, and children aged 4-6 should not exceed 3 grams. Children aged 7-10 years old should not exceed 4 grams. Elderly people over 65 years old should not exceed 5 grams. The salt content in a pack of spicy strips exceeds the recommended salt intake for adults and far exceeds the recommended amount for children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For children, it is this kind of unhealthy snacks that develops their later eating habits and tastes, lays the foundation for year-round intake of unhealthy diets, and also contributes to cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, obesity, and diabetes. Hidden dangers have been laid. Of course, unhealthy snacks also rely on their addictive properties to attract people and affect their health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another recently published study shows that highly processed foods, whether snacks or meals, rewire the brain&#39;s reward circuitry and activate the brain in a manner similar to cravings for cocaine. Highly processed foods can trigger addiction related to drugs or alcohol. One mechanism is that highly processed foods cause the release of dopamine in the brain (similar to amphetamine) and can lead to withdrawal symptoms (at least in children and teenagers), two hallmarks of addiction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Highly processed foods contain large amounts of sugar, salt, fat, artificial colors or preservatives, and contain other ingredients such as hydrogenated fats, fillers and starches to maximize flavor (called optimal taste point), thereby attracting people to continue eating. Moreover, hydrogenated fat or non-dairy creamer (creamer) tastes better than natural milk. Many people like to add it to their coffee. This delicious agent is also widely used in processed beverages and makes people addicted. This kind of fat is more harmful and difficult for the human body to decompose, and will aggravate the development of vascular diseases such as arteriosclerosis. Processed fructose, which is sweet and delicious, is also commonly used in beverages such as hydrogenated fat or non-dairy creamer, which can increase the occurrence of metabolic diseases and lead to addiction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course you have to eat snacks. The easiest way is to replace unhealthy snacks such as biscuits, potato chips and cakes with healthy snacks such as fruits and nuts. There are many healthy snack options, including fresh, natural foods. Vegetables such as cucumbers, tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, etc.; fruits such as strawberries, mangos, apples, pears, etc.; milks such as pure milk, sugar-free yogurt, low-salt cheese, etc.; beans such as sugar-free soy milk, tofu pudding, edamame, etc.; Original nuts such as walnuts, almonds, cashews, hazelnuts, pine nuts, dried fruits, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not impossible to eat biscuits and pastries, but you should choose those made with low sugar, salt and grains. The time when you eat snacks is also crucial to your health. If you eat snacks after 9 pm, your blood indicators will be worse and it will have a greater negative impact on your health. Therefore, you should not eat or eat less snacks after 9 pm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 24 Sep 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
