This innovation is gradually spreading in aging communities. Other netizens added that Shanghai began to install smart water meters after a series of elderly people died alone in their homes and were found to be smelly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Their words caused a burst of sighs. Some netizens said bluntly that they were hurt in their hearts after reading the relevant content. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This statement is not based on imagination, but is supported by news reports. Regarding the death of an old man without anyone knowing, here is an example: In December 2021, a news piece about &quot;an old man living alone in Shanghai died for many days and was discovered by firefighters&quot; attracted attention. According to neighbors, the old man is a native of Shanghai and is in his seventies. When the neighbor comes back from get off work every day, the old man will greet him, but he has not seen the old man for 5 days. I smelled a bad smell recently and called the police. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of thing is not unique to Shanghai, it has happened in many places. For example, in November 2015, an old man surnamed Pei in Huangshi, Hubei Province, who had never been married and lived alone for many years, was found dead in the bathroom of his home. His body had turned into a pile of bones. According to media reports, the elderly man disappeared six years ago. Community workers and police worked with the deceased’s relatives to search for him but failed. The local Dongchu Evening News reported that “a 70-year-old man has disappeared from the world for more than a year.” Conducted special news reports on the topic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This type of innovation is not unique to Shanghai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the installation of smart water meters, CCTV&#39;s &quot;News 1+1&quot; reported in December 2020 that Jiangsu Road Street, Changning District, Shanghai, installed smart water meters for 6 elderly households living alone in the area. If the reading is less than 0.01 cubic meters within 12 hours, the neighborhood committee will immediately receive the signal and send someone to check it in time. It was on a pilot basis at the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, such practices have appeared frequently in various places. For example, in May 2021, the Beijing Daily client reported that 25 elderly households living alone in the Red House Community in Nanyuan Street, Fengtai District used smart water meters with automatic alarms for free. If the water meter reading is less than 1 liter within 12 hours, the information will be fed back to the neighborhood committee, and someone will come to visit. In addition, smart mattresses, smart light sensors and smart one-button alarms can capture information about the daily activities of elderly people living alone. Once an abnormality is discovered, the back-end staff will promptly contact the community and the elderly&#39;s family members to provide safety protection for the elderly living alone and the disabled elderly. In July 2022, the website of the People&#39;s Government of Haishu District, Ningbo, Zhejiang published this news: &quot;Water Meter Butler&quot; to protect elderly people living alone is online. Abnormal water consumption will automatically alarm 24 hours a day to protect safety. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 16, 2023, Foshan Sanshui Foshui Water Supply Co., Ltd. launched the Sanshui District’s “Political and Public Conduct Hotline-Dialogue on People’s Livelihood” program. The company said: We have monitored that elderly people living alone use water When the data volume is abnormal, the grid staff of the village or neighborhood committee will be contacted. For example, if an elderly person used 0.5 cubic meters of water one day and no water the next day, we will recognize this change and notify the grid operator at the residence of the elderly person living alone to contact the civil affairs department and go to the scene to contact the elderly person. Make connections to see if there are any abnormalities in water use or other aspects. We hope that by monitoring water usage, the lives of elderly people living alone can be helped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s cryptic, but you know the meaning. News reports use suggestive and evocative language to describe objective facts. Relatively speaking, netizens’ vernacular is more shocking. But no matter how you express it, the core of the truth is indeed so bleak. For an elderly person living alone, it is not surprising that once his health has problems and no one is around to take care of him, his later life will be miserable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The author has talked about the importance of having children in many articles. Whether you have children or not, the outcome is very different. That kind of blood and spiritual connection cannot be replaced by any instrument. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, even if you have children, there may still be problems with the elderly living alone and the children not visiting the elderly often. The children of the aforementioned elderly people living alone in Shanghai live in the outer suburbs. The old man passed away, and the children didn&#39;t know about it. It can be seen that they haven&#39;t visited him for many days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many reasons why children and the elderly are separated and lack of care for the elderly. For example, some children are extremely busy at work or start a business in other places. As for the elderly who do not want their children to disturb their lives due to differences in interests, temperaments, and cognitions, there are many examples. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But more importantly, the Chinese family structure of three generations and four generations living under one roof has long been impacted by many trendy concepts, such as &quot;separating children and the elderly is more conducive to harmonious relationships&quot; and &quot;children and children living together harmoniously.&quot; The elderly live separately but keep a bowl of hot soup away.&quot; In this context, it is an indisputable fact that more and more elderly people live alone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No matter what factors cause the elderly to live alone, it is indeed a worrying social problem for the elderly to live alone and be temporarily or permanently &quot;forgotten&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to solve it? It is a proposition worth examining that the elderly and their children should live together as much as possible. Of course, taking into account various practical problems, &quot;living together&quot; should include the option of &quot;living nearby&quot; for children and the elderly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Singapore attaches great importance to promoting this &quot;project&quot;. For a long time, in order to encourage children to live with the elderly, the government has provided conveniences and discounts to families living with the elderly in HDB flats, such as when allocating government flats. Price discounts and priority arrangements will be given to families with three generations living under one roof. In addition, a series of subsidy programs have been launched to provide elderly care and medical subsidies to low-income families supporting the elderly to reduce their family burden. This move increases the enthusiasm of young people and the elderly to live together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order for family care to become the main way to provide for the elderly, policy promotion is essential. In November 2021, the &quot;Opinions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Strengthening the Work on Aging in the New Era&quot; was released, emphasizing the need to improve the elderly care service system, innovate the home and community elderly care service model, and based on home care, through new construction, renovation, leasing, etc. Community elderly care service capabilities. Adult children are encouraged to live nearby or together with their elderly parents to fulfill their support obligations and assume care responsibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth mentioning that relevant surveys show that 58.51% of adult children are willing to live with the elderly. This ratio gives people confidence. It is not difficult to realize the vision of &quot;living together&quot; for children and the elderly on a larger scale when they are trying their best to shoulder the responsibilities and obligations of providing for the elderly, and with the help of good governance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 07 Nov 2023 15:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中产三宝拉夫劳伦不香了，年轻人开始走“没钱风”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260078]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-07 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/06/0d38a337b2acadb1e7320d558b846b73.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;952&quot; height=&quot;636&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/11/06/0d38a337b2acadb1e7320d558b846b73.png&quot; data-key=&quot;257148&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo / picture）&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It is said that the middle class has three treasures: Ralph Lauren, lululemon and Archaeopteryx. But recently, Ralph Lauren, one of the three treasures of the middle class, has begun to lose its sales. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The financial report for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 shows that as of July 2023, Ralph Lauren’s sales increased by only 0.4% compared with the same period last year. North America performed poorly, with revenue down 10%, and growth in the European market also slowed. Overall, the performance in the past two years has been slightly weak. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Then the question is, as a classic representative of &quot;rich style&quot;, Ralph Lauren was once considered a must-have for the middle class. How did the miracle of Ralph Lauren&#39;s rise be explained? Created? How did it gradually come down from the altar? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Ralph Lauren and Old Money Style&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 1967, Ralph Lauren was founded by Ralph Lauren was founded in the United States and is positioned as a designer brand full of American classics and British style. In the early days, by sponsoring popular films such as &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; and &quot;Annie Hall,&quot; Ralph Lauren successfully bound itself to the &quot;American Dream.&quot; In countless American literature, &quot;models dressed like Ralph Lauren&quot; ” is another expression of becoming a superior person. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The classic polo logo and stand-up collar Polo shirt have conquered many middle-aged men, unified the aesthetics of elite men around the world, and established a firm foothold in their cloakrooms. Ralph Lauren&#39;s Polo shirt is as classic as jeans are to Reeves, and down jackets are to Bosideng. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In addition, long-lasting Ralph Lauren classic items such as cable-knit sweaters and Oxford cloth shirts are popular all year round, which can be said to be an effortless way to look old money. A styling tool that sells well all over the world. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Speaking of the &quot;old money style&quot; that made Ralph Lauren out of the industry, why are the new middle class so attracted to it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>; &quot;Old money&quot; is a concept opposite to the &quot;new middle class&quot;. They are often people who were born in Rome and have been rich for several generations. They are known as the royal family. Most of them are nobles or wealthy businessmen, and they are in a class that is beyond the reach of ordinary people. And their dressing sense shows distinctive characteristics. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The overall style is mostly basic, with silhouette-based clothing styles, classic and timeless designs, brand logos that are not deliberately displayed, and fabrics that look expensive. What matters is high-end and quality. The happiness of rich people is so unpretentious and boring. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The beauty of &quot;old money style&quot; is not piled up, nor is it created by luxury goods, but is enduring after time, calm retro and A solemn elegance, noble and unassuming, low-key but deeply rooted in people&#39;s hearts. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As Paul Fussell said as early as the 1980s in his sociological work &quot;Style: Social Class and Lifestyle&quot;: In appearance, housing , consumption, leisure, furnishings, spiritual life, language and other aspects of realization will reflect different social levels. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Because machine-made consumer products are so perfect that their high-profile and cheapness can be recognized at a glance, and colors with grayscale components that deviate from the machine have become the center of attention. The favor of the upper class. “The softer and darker the color, the more classy it is.” “Low-key is a common tendency.” &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The behavior of being covered in luxury goods with logos, wanting to wear the most valuable possessions on your body, and showing off your money and power to others is what the old money do. Disdainful, with the aura of rich people and nouveau riche, too exaggerated and flashy, and appearing to be using too much force. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The unified and harmonious color system, clean and simple clothes, on the contrary, look noble and elegant, with a natural sense of relaxation, and show off effortlessly. sense of fashion. This is the essence of old money style, which is simple and low-key, but has texture and looks full of nobility without any effort. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Ralph Lauren is at the forefront of this old money trend. At first glance, it looks ordinary among the crowd, but at a closer look, the brand&#39;s logo reveals its identity and status. It is conveyed in a low-key yet high-profile way, perfectly capturing the middle-aged people&#39;s preference for high-end brands. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Relying on its close ties with the &quot;old money style&quot;, Ralph Lauren successfully captured the American elite, and then embarked on a journey of global expansion, without exception. Let China&#39;s middle class compete for it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/06/510edbfc3b41bdcca5acf9dfc0526a7d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1349&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/06/510edbfc3b41bdcca5acf9dfc0526a7d.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257145 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>; The three treasures of the middle class cannot be loved by young people? &lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the 2007 domestic drama &quot;Struggle&quot;, Tong Dawei wore a Ralph Lauren Polo shirt, which brought this American elite brand into the eyes of a wider range of Chinese people. Since then, Ralph Lauren has begun its own golden age. Through the offline agency model, it has spread all over the country and achieved rapid expansion. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;However, success is also a failure. A large number of stores introduced low-end lines in order to reduce sales, which lowered the brand level. Frequent discounts destroyed consumer trust, and counterfeit goods The proliferation of it on the streets has also caused the brand image to plummet. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Ralph Lauren’s financial reports have changed from the previous highs to continuous declines, and ushered in the darkest moment in 2021. Compared with the peak, revenue fell by 40%. Only 4.4 billion yuan. And due to the impact of the epidemic, half of China’s offline stores have been closed. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After this, Ralph Lauren began drastic reforms, completely transforming the Chinese market into direct sales, and began high-end and digital transformation. Marketing focuses on KOL and social media, and also launches younger sub-brands. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Nowadays, the trend of &quot;how to dress like a rich girl&quot; is popular among Generation Z. The makeup and clothing of rich girls are flooding the social media at home and abroad, attracting attention. There are many imitators. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After being immune to the dopamine style, sweet-cool-girl style, and Y2K style, the reincarnation of fashion has returned to the &quot;old money style&quot; style, and young people have begun to get involved. The nostalgic complex of &quot;old money style&quot; has the ultimate pursuit of making oneself dress more luxurious, hoping that one can create a low-key, refined and elegant image to the outside world. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As a result, Ralph Lauren has gradually begun to win over young people from harvesting the middle-aged three treasures of the middle class. It is worth thinking about that the short-term preference of young people does not make Ralph Lauren confident. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Essentially, &quot;old money style&quot; is also a fresh trend. Young people are yearning for another kind of life even though they can&#39;t get it. They can feel it through their outfits. The world of &quot;old money&quot; is a feasible strategy. However, after trying it, they often lose long-term interest, stop trying it and fall in love with it, and the late wavers rush to the next fashion trend non-stop. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Once a representative of the old money style, Ralph Lauren was sought after as a must-have item. However, when the &quot;old money style&quot; lost its popularity, the price increased by 80% in five years. Young people just can’t fall in love with Ralph Lauren. After all, in today&#39;s risk society, young people pursue stability more and are less arbitrary and more rational in spending money. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Basic Polo shirts, which can easily cost three to four thousand a piece, are really hard to get rid of. At this time, I look back and see that the UNIQLO co-branded models and MUJI are really good. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;When the current trend of &quot;no money&quot; begins, and consumption downgrades are accompanied by clothing downgrades, we don&#39;t know how long Ralph Lauren will remain popular in China. What is certain is that &quot;the North Face team was all members last year, the Birdman team was last year, and the Ralph Lauren team is this year.&quot; In the dictionary of fashion, nothing is immortal. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Outfitting is not only a style, but also an expression of personality, so Ralph Lauren is just a symbol. Young people don’t care which brand this symbol is embodied by. , the point is, a way of thinking and attitude towards life that is not influenced by trends. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 07 Nov 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[毕业生就业难，企业用工荒，创新国际化办学可破就业“悖论”？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260104]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-07 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;January 29, 2023, Haining, Zhejiang, on the production line of a company.

(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Obviously companies are in short supply of people, why can&#39;t college graduates find jobs?&quot; October 30, 2023, in Zhejiang At the third &quot;Zhejiang University Oriental Forum Haining Sub-Forum&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Forum&quot;) held in Haining City, Zhejiang Province, Chen Lijun, a professor at the School of Public Administration of Zhejiang University, raised a &quot;paradox&quot; about employment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After analyzing millions of employment data of global college graduates on LinkedIn China (LinkedIn), Chen Lijun found that the employment data of the top 100 college graduates in the world&#39;s QS rankings The first-time employment rate (the number of people who choose to work after their first graduation) is close to 80%. In China&#39;s leading universities, this figure is close to 50%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chen Lijun believes that an important reason for the emergence of the &quot;paradox&quot; is the disconnect between the talent chain and the education chain. &quot;The talents cultivated by schools are not the talents that enterprises need.&quot; , the industrial chain is disconnected from the talent chain, causing employment difficulties and labor shortages to coexist.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For the county economy, the problem of connecting high-end talents and enterprises may be more serious. Significantly. In Haining, where the forum was held, one local solution was to introduce educational resources. As early as 2013, the Haining Municipal Government reached a cooperation with Zhejiang University and introduced Zhejiang University International College. The goal of the cooperation between the two parties is to establish an international cooperative education model area with the Haining campus of Zhejiang University International College as the main body and linking the entire Haining area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Today, Zhejiang Haining International Campus has been recruiting students for seven years. Wang Yiming, executive deputy mayor of Haining City, proposed at the forum that the cooperation between Zhejiang University and Haining is &quot;gradually getting better.&quot; &quot;The integration of schools and places, the integration of science and technology, and the integration of industries are getting deeper and deeper, and supporting talent and employment services are also keeping up,&quot; but he also admitted that &quot;it is still difficult to introduce and retain talents.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; h4>;Innovative international education&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Haining is a county-level city under the jurisdiction of Zhejiang Province, adjacent to the provincial capital Hangzhou and only more than 100 kilometers away from Shanghai. It was once known as the &quot;Leather Capital&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The problem of human resources is a prominent issue in county development.&quot; Professor Wu Jiebing of the School of Public Administration of Zhejiang University introduced at the seminar that before 2010, he had After conducting research on the leather industry in Haining, companies reported that “it is difficult to attract undergraduate graduates from a prestigious university.” More graduates chose to stay in Shanghai or Hangzhou, where companies have R&amp;D centers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The problem facing Haining is how to gather talents and innovate and develop high-tech industries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It was also around 2010 that Chinese universities launched a wave of innovative international education. Duke Kunshan University, New York University Shanghai, Wenzhou-Kean University and other Sino-foreign cooperative universities have been approved for establishment. Interestingly, combined with the previous University of Nottingham Ningbo and Xi&#39;an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, the economically developed Yangtze River Delta region has concentrated half of the Sino-foreign joint universities with independent legal personality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2013, Zhejiang University reached a cooperation with the Haining Municipal Government, and the school’s International Union College settled in Haining. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;International education is closely related to local economic development needs. After analyzing provincial panel data from 1997 to 2019, Li Fengliang, a professor at the Graduate School of Education at Tsinghua University, found that whether it was the number of Sino-foreign cooperative education institutions or the number of projects, there was a significant positive correlation between the scale of Sino-foreign cooperative education and the level of economic development. This shows that the expansion of education opening to the outside world can promote the improvement of economic development levels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In September 2016, Zhejiang University Haining International Campus officially opened. At the end of the same year, Haining decided to build a new science and technology city based on Zhejiang Haining International Campus, focusing on the three industries of pan-semiconductor, life and health, and modern service industries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some scholars once pointed out that international education is a double-edged sword. Hong Chengwen, executive deputy director of the Institute of Higher Education of Beijing Normal University, once compared decorating a house to China. He believes that the internationalization of education is to decorate his own home with the best materials, but the ultimate goal of internationalization of education should be &quot;how to serve other people&#39;s houses and be a house designer.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Qu Lijuan, deputy dean of Zhejiang Haining International Campus, said, &quot;The main task of Zhejiang Haining International Campus is to introduce advanced school running concepts, education models and investment mechanisms. The International Union College has established extensive links with world-class academics, and then empowers local economic development through education, technology, and talents, and the corresponding transformation of scientific and technological achievements must be completed locally.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot; On October 30, 2023, Haining, Zhejiang, the third &quot;Zhejiang University Oriental Forum Haining Sub-forum&quot; roundtable meeting, Chen Lijun, professor of School of Public Administration, Zhejiang University.

High-skilled talents (cannot be recruited) should be said between education and the industrial chain The disconnect between them is already serious.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, there is also a disconnect between the education chain and the innovation chain. &quot;The conversion rate of scientific and technological achievements in our domestic universities is only about 6%,&quot; Chen Lijun pointed out, &quot;There are &#39;two skins&#39; between many university campuses and industrial parks.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In our country, the agglomeration between various innovation elements is still There are certain problems.&quot; Chen Lijun mentioned that a very important feature of global science and technology innovation centers is the high concentration and integration of various innovation elements, including universities, scientific research institutes, enterprises, and various intermediary agencies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;How to solve the integration problem among the talent chain, industry chain, education chain, and innovation chain (referred to as the &quot;four chains&quot;)? Chen Lijun pointed out that one way is to deploy innovation and industrial chains around the talent chain, such as the cooperation model between Zhejiang University and Haining. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Wang Yiming&#39;s view, talents are the media between the education chain, the industrial chain, and the innovation chain. He introduced that the campus-site cooperation between Haining and Zhejiang University has begun to bear fruit. “In terms of campus-site integration, we have established a campus-site construction committee and an international education cooperation office, and established a science and technology innovation fund for talents to provide institutional and design guarantees. ; In terms of scientific and technological innovation integration, the Hangzhou Bay North Wing Science and Technology Innovation Hub is under construction and is expected to be initially formed in 2025; in terms of industrial integration, we have built 8 industry-education centers with Zhejiang University; in terms of employment support for talents, we have newly built a new hub around the campus international schools and international hotels.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Can innovative international education retain talents and solve the employment paradox? According to data released by the International Union College of Zhejiang University, the further study rate of the college’s first three graduates reached 89.7%, and the overseas further study rate reached 66.2%. Wang Yiming mentioned that it is still difficult to introduce and retain talents. &quot;When will so many of our students for further studies come back? If they can come back to China, it will be the result of successful technological transformation, but what we have seen so far is not very good.&quot; &quot;More.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The related background is that after a wave of terminations of Sino-foreign cooperative education institutions and projects around 2018, international education has picked up. According to data released by the Sino-foreign cooperative education supervision information platform, as of the end of May 2022, there are more than 1,300 Sino-foreign cooperative education institutions and projects operating at undergraduate and above levels in ordinary colleges and universities across the country, with more than 700,000 students enrolled. Judging from the scale distribution of provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) within the country, except for Tibet, the other 30 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) have opened different types of Sino-foreign cooperative schools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;(Retaining) international talents is not only a shortcoming of Zhejiang Province, but also a shortcoming of the entire China.&quot; Chen Lijun said that studying abroad is a global talent flow The most important way, judging from the existing data, is that 50% of people in China&#39;s advantaged universities want to further their studies, and 70% of them choose to go abroad. In terms of return-to-return ratio, China only ranks 100th in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Yiming admitted frankly that the breadth and depth of cooperation between the two parties need to be further deepened in the future. He revealed, &quot;The new round of cooperation will invest 10 billion to provide elements for talents. Guarantee, how to actively cultivate innovation (talents) in the future is a test of the capabilities and level of Haining Municipal Government.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 07 Nov 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[佳木斯体育馆坍塌背后：建设单位多次中标市政工程，涉事广场系省级重点项目]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260102]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-07 11:21:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/07/FL9ZJRTyvyLXtiDcUFkgyB4RAlS5XKsule9kZFXn.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; ​​height=&quot;338&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/FL9ZJRTyvyLXtiDcUFkgyB4RAlS5XKsule9kZ FXn. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257226&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Yuecheng Plaza. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Huanan County People&#39;s Government Website/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Less than four months after the roof collapse of the gymnasium of No. 34 Middle School in Qiqihar, Heilongjiang Province, the tragedy happened again , the roof of Jiamusihua Nanyuecheng Stadium, 600 kilometers away, also collapsed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a notice from the Huanan County Government, around 19:20 on November 6, 2023, a partial collapse occurred in the Yuecheng Gymnasium in Hunan County, Jiamusi City. It was initially confirmed at the scene that three people were trapped in the gymnasium. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the time of the Qiqihar incident, there had been heavy rains for several days. In this incident, more than 15 mm of snow fell in Hunan County for 6 consecutive hours, and a red warning for heavy snowfall was issued. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The notice showed that the Yuecheng Gymnasium where the incident occurred was a two-story frame structure with a construction area of ​​about 2,000 square meters. The collapse location was the basketball area on the second floor on the west side, with the collapsed area of ​​about 500 square meters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are three venues in this gymnasium. The collapsed basketball hall, a table tennis hall on the first floor, and a children&#39;s physical training hall on the second floor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zhicheng is the owner of this children&#39;s physical training gym. He told Southern Weekend reporters that it happened to be a rest day for the gym and was used for cleaning and cleaning. There was no one in the gym where he was when the incident occurred. The basketball court and table tennis hall on the first floor should be open for normal business. Under normal circumstances, they will not close until 9 p.m., but &quot;there should be no people on Monday.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Li Zhicheng received the news, he cooperated with the police and obtained the surveillance video of the incident on the entire second floor. At that time, the police also wanted to use his camera to confirm whether anyone was trapped. Surveillance video showed that around 19:20, the entire roof suddenly collapsed. He originally added a plaster wall on the second floor. The entire wall was washed down by the huge air wave, and the camera also fell down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zhicheng borrowed 200,000 yuan from a friend to open this venue. &quot;Our family is still a poor household in the county. We originally thought that we could make back our money in the first two years, but we failed in the third and fourth years.&quot; I can make a profit, but now I have nothing. Fortunately among misfortunes, my store happened to be doing a general cleaning today. If there were casualties in my store, I would never be able to live with it for the rest of my life. My parents are quite heartwarming anyway, and they are all asking me if I have any problems. It’s okay”. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The incident had just been inspected two months ago&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Information Office of Huanan County Government of Heilongjiang Province issued a notice in the early morning: At 0:35 on November 7, Yuecheng, Huanan County Rescue completed at the scene of a partial collapse of a fitness gym. When the accident occurred, there were seven people at the scene, three of whom escaped on their own, one was slightly injured, and three were killed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The venue where the accident occurred belongs to the New Sunshine Fitness Club in Huanan County, and the person in charge of the club has been controlled by the police. The cause of the accident is under further investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found out that the legal representative of New Sunshine Fitness Club is Men Yanan. Around 22:52 on November 6, Southern Weekend reporters called Men Yanan several times, but the call was always busy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Men Yanan opened the Yuecheng Sports and Fitness Club on April 8, 2021, but canceled it, and then re-registered the New Sunshine Construction Club at the original address on July 20, 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reports from the official Huanan County media &quot;Damei Huanan&quot; showed that two months before the incident, on the afternoon of September 5, 2023, Dong Lijuan, member of the Standing Committee of the Huanan County Party Committee, led a team to inspect the safety of the cultural and entertainment market. Production work, Yuecheng Sunshine Fitness and Yuecheng Good Voice KTV are among the inspection sites. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/UfZ57TmF0Kxawz0rsT2wZfOXEqattzYkkFOiBRrB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;535&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/UfZ57TmF0Kxawz0rsT2wZfOXEqattzYkkFOiBRrB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257227&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 5, venues including Yuecheng Sunshine Fitness conducted safety production inspections. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Damei Huanan/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Local media reported that &quot;Dong Lijuan carefully checked the safety risks of each place wherever she went.

If rectification measures cannot be clarified on-site, , make a list of problems, and instruct relevant departments and responsible persons to put forward rectification opinions and plans, and make rectifications in place within a deadline.&quot; Dong Lijuan said that we must pay close attention to the awareness of safety production risk prevention and control, &quot;keep an eye on outstanding problems and major hidden dangers, Grasping it to the end. Continue to build a strong awareness of safety red lines and the rule of law, promote the implementation of safety production responsibilities, ensure that the safety production situation continues to be stable, and the mass cultural undertakings advance steadily and orderly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Local media reported that on July 24, Cheng Xianfeng, deputy secretary of the Huanan County Party Committee and county magistrate, also visited the Yuecheng Plaza National Fitness Gym to inspect the implementation of safety work. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Both construction units are major bidders&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found out that the stadium is part of the Yuecheng Plaza complex, and the developer of the project is Heilongjiang Yuecheng Real Estate Development Co., Ltd. Company (hereinafter referred to as Yuecheng Real Estate). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public bidding information shows that the project has two phases. The construction unit that won the bid for the first phase is Heilongjiang Haifeng Weiye Construction and Installation Engineering Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Haifeng Weiye). The construction start date is June 30, 2018, and the completion date is October 1, 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The winning construction unit for the second phase is Heilongjiang Huayou Construction Engineering Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Huayou Construction). The construction start date is June 10, 2018, and the completion date is October 1, 2020. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporter contacted Yue Chengqi, the legal representative of Haifeng Weiye. The other party said that he was aware of the stadium collapse incident, but was not sure whether it was a project built by him and &quot;needs to go back and check the information.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tendering information shows that Haifeng Weiye is a major tenderer of the Huanan County Government and participates in a wide variety of projects. In terms of municipal projects, we have undertaken the construction of public parking lots, roads, high-speed rail parking lots, etc., and medical projects include the county CDC, the infectious disease area of ​​the county hospital, and the 120 emergency center, as well as the construction of beautiful rural infrastructure in Huanan County and the county power supply bureau. The material reserve warehouse and the black soil transfer earthwork in the pig slaughtering plant area of ​​Huanan Economic Development Zone. In addition, we also won the bid for the county&#39;s affordable housing project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mou Yandong, the shareholder of Huayou Construction, the winning bidder for the second phase of Yuecheng Phase II, is the second shareholder of Yuecheng Real Estate. Similar to Haifeng Weiye, Huayou Construction is also a major tenderer for government projects. In addition to Yuecheng Plaza, it has received at least three government projects, namely the Jiamusi Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital’s medical housing renovation project, the Huachuan County Culture, Radio, Television, Press and Publication Bureau’s cultural facilities construction project, and the Huannan County village and town construction project. Management center’s dilapidated house renovation project in Hunan County. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A company was also registered at the address of the collapsed stadium, called Heilongjiang Yuecheng Sports Culture Development Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Yuecheng Sports). The legal representative of this company, Sun Yongjun, is Yue. Supervisor of City Real Estate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is quite strange is that Yuecheng Real Estate and Yuecheng Sports have been canceled in 2021 and 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yuecheng Real Estate was once a local star company. According to local media reports in Huanan, “After vigorous investment promotion by the county housing and construction department, Beijing Deyi Yintong Technology Co., Ltd. invested 380 million yuan in the former Olin in the county. Xincun Phase III shanty town construction urban complex project, and invested and registered Heilongjiang Yuecheng Real Estate Development Co., Ltd. The project started construction in May 2016 and was completed in October 2019.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;报道中表示，“悦城广场项目经理说，我们的项目在桦南县委、县政府及相关部门的大力支持下现在已完成的工程量有回迁楼两栋，面积是3.4万平方米，城市综合体商业面积是2.8万平方米，高档住宅小区的面积是1.6万平方米。2017年我们公司计划投资1.7亿元人民币，现已全部到位，施工的前期各项准备工作也安排就绪，现在商住这一块进行到内外装修阶段，预计八月份完工投入使用”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者查询到，悦城广场综合体项目位列黑龙江的省级重点项目，曾在2017年出现在桦南县政府工作报告中。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;至今，桦南县政府官网上还保留着当年盛况的报道。 2018年1月22日，桦南县悦城广场开业，由县政府副县长致开幕词并宣布开业。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;悦城广场被介绍为，“集休闲、娱乐、购物、体验等多功能为一体的城市综合商业体，项目自身具备的业态优势、功能优势、品味优势、特色优势、规模优势、服务优势、品牌优势等使项目整体处于极具竞争力的主导地位，必将成为全县知名的城市综合体项目，提高城市品味，为全面建设活力、文明、生态、诚信、智慧、和谐、幸福的美丽桦南增光添彩”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;多位周边邻居向南方周末记者证实，事发的悦城体育馆已经封锁，可位于悦城广场商场内的KTV当晚仍正常营业。在大众点评上，网友评论悦城广场是这个县城最能消遣的地方了，“来这个小县城几趟，别的地方没记住，这商场还真不错，健身房用的都是国际大品牌器械，和哈尔滨一万多一年的健身房一样。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（应受访者要求，文中李志成为化名。）&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;当时馆内到底有多少人，其中有多少学生，伤亡情况如何，是公众急切想了解的内容。根据当地政府新闻办最新披露：7日0时35分，事故现场已经完成救援；事故发生时，现场共有7人，其中3人自行脱险，1人轻伤，3人遇难；发生该事故的场馆属于桦南县新阳光健身俱乐部，俱乐部负责人已被警方控制。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那么，是什么原因导致了体育馆坍塌？据央视报道，该体育馆为2层框架结构，建筑面积约2000平方米，坍塌位置为西侧2楼篮球区域，坍塌面积约为500平方米。网传视频显示，一建筑物楼顶发生倒塌，四面墙体完好，建筑物约两层高，现场满是积雪和墙体碎块。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;体育馆楼顶坍塌，不禁让人想起今年7月发生的齐齐哈尔市第三十四中学体育馆屋顶坍塌事故。那次事故导致正在馆内训练的该校女排11名师生遇难。而坍塌的原因，是施工单位违规将珍珠岩堆置在体育馆屋顶，珍珠岩吸收雨水增重，导致屋顶荷载增大引发坍塌。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这次桦南县体育馆坍塌，也是屋顶坍塌，与齐齐哈尔体育馆坍塌事故有相似之处。因此，也有声音将原因指向大雪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据佳木斯市气象台11月6日17时30分发布的暴雪红色预警信号，该市6小时累计降雪量已达15毫米，预计降雪将持续至7日上午，过程累计降雪量可达25-35毫米。桦南县气象台则在稍早一点的16时47分发布暴雪红色预警信号：我县6小时内降雪量已达15毫米以上且降雪仍在持续，请注意防范。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;齐齐哈尔市三十四中体育馆坍塌，与降雨有关。事发之前一段时间当地频频下雨，珍珠岩吸水之后可增重3倍，且水分不容易散发掉，多次下雨后，珍珠岩的重量会增加很多。而且这些珍珠岩建材并不是平铺在屋顶，而是集聚在一处，增加了部分屋顶结构承受的压力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而桦南县这次坍塌的体育馆，屋顶承受的是雪。从网传视频来看，地面积雪并不太深。此时东北也入冬不久，此前应该没有积雪，屋顶的雪主要是这次降雪过程带来的。雪与雨水不同，不会聚集到一处，压力是基本上平分到整个屋顶的。 15毫米的降雪量就足以压塌一座球场的屋顶吗？换算成压强，不过15千克力/平方米，或147N/平方米而已。不上人屋面的活荷载标准值为0.5kN/平方米（每平方米50千克力）。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与齐齐哈尔市三十四中体育馆是有三十多年历史的老建筑相比，据媒体援引目击者消息报道，桦南县坍塌的体育馆是近年来新建的城市综合体的一部分，如果整个屋顶连15千克力/平方米的压强都无法承受，其建筑质量是否过关？当初是怎么通过验收的？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;值得注意的是，齐齐哈尔市三十四中体育馆坍塌后，黑龙江省曾在当晚紧急召开全省安全生产工作视频会议，要求迅速组织排查各类学校、公益体育场馆的建筑安全。根据桦南县政府网站消息，2023年7月24日下午，也就是齐齐哈尔市三十四中体育馆屋顶坍塌第二天，桦南县县长曾专门到悦城广场全民健身体育馆察看安全工作落实情况。仅仅过了3个多月，这座体育馆就发生了极其类似的屋顶坍塌事故，说明桦南县当时恐怕只是走个形式，并没有认真进行安全排查。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而在齐齐哈尔市三十四中体育馆坍塌事故发生四个月前，齐齐哈尔市教育局也曾经开展过校舍安全检查。这次安全检查，同样没有发现体育馆屋顶上堆放大量珍珠岩这一严重的安全隐患，最终导致悲剧发生。事故发生原因虽有降雨因素，但更是人祸。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这次桦南县体育馆屋顶坍塌，真正的原因尚待查明。但无论如何，屋顶坍塌说明3个月前的建筑安全检查肯定是不到位的。这些走马观花、应付公事、形式主义的检查，还有多少？还要付出多少生命的代价，才能换回对安全的真正重视？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这座体育馆在3个月前的安全检查中轻松过关，如何解释？更重要的是，这一体育馆是当地2018年建成的招商引资项目悦城广场城市综合商业体的一部分。这一综合体总建筑面积11万多平方米，包括商业、住宅和配套公建等等。体育馆建筑质量如此不堪的话，整个综合体的其他部分，有没有质量问题和安全隐患？这可是比体育馆质量安全严重得多的大问题。建筑施工单位、监理单位、开发商与当地监管部门分别应该承担什么责任，应该搞清楚；俱乐部负责人在这个施工过程中有没有责任，也应该搞清楚，不能让运营方成为整个事件的背锅侠。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;公众期待这些问题能尽快得到答案。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 07 Nov 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[史国威：打破摄影与绘画的边界]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259929]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-07 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/xg0hnrzo0ZCiBuLzrU0BwZisyNWVwdgt8GSxiT6p.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;室内空间越来越小，史国威在一楼画画的时候，他的猫们便待在loft的二楼；有时即使下楼跳上工作台，也懂得始终和正在作画的区域保持一米距离。看着这群年事已高的宠物，如同目睹一个过度清晰的结局。此前接连送走几只，他再也不敢养新的猫，想到一次次站在火葬场炉子前面的场景，就不禁流露出痛苦的神色，“心脏实在受不了了”。眼下的几只他也只能随遇而安，“不敢带它们去做体检，都这么老了，查出问题肯定要治，精力、时间，还有费用上都承受不了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;早知道要反复面对这种煎熬，刚开始他兴许就选择绕过这一遭。那会儿是2006年，他刚从德国多特蒙德高等专业学院学完摄影回来，和当时很多兴奋潦倒、试图成为艺术家的年轻人一样，在黑桥弄了间阔大的工作室，棚内摆拍完成后，将人物照与户外实景和带有中国元素的物品循着西方名画拼贴合成，洗成近两米宽的巨幅黑白照，最终手工上色成彩色绘画作品。做盆景生意的父亲有时来看史国威，从北京曾经最大的莱太花卉市场揣来一窝出生不久的流浪猫，他不忍放逐，只好收下这堆花色迥异的兄弟姐妹。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;大学时他就读于清华美院平面视觉艺术交流系摄影专业，但前三年的课程跟摄影毫无直接关联，每天都在训练素描、色彩、雕塑等技能，光是素描基础课就上了两年，练就了和美术生无异的绘画功底。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;确定了摄影加绘画的创作方式，内容构思上他依然围绕后面几年忙活的东西方文化对比，请外国模特穿上花木兰戏服，再请中国模特穿侠盗罗宾汉的服装，或是打扮成教皇模样，脸上却画着京剧脸谱。“这个比较好操作，还能够用大座机，起码材料上就比大家牛逼。黑白照冲印好后我再用手工上色的办法把它给画成彩色，这样的话马上就凸显出来，你跟所有学生都不一样。”&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;策展人及评论家凯伦·史密斯曾总结过，“他观察并记录景象，创作出传统摄影风格的黑白照片，随后对其进行长时间的手工上色。这一过程不仅要求相机镜头背后的眼手协调，亦需精准把控笔刷的涂抹方式；自德国多特蒙德高等摄影学院学成归国后，史国威逐渐形成了自己持恒不变、令人叹服的视觉表达方式，在摄影和绘画间寻得细腻精巧的融合。而其中诸多材料与手法的结合，也使其作品承载的内涵远超&#39;手工上色照片&#39;这一标签的字面意义。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;回国初期，对于作品中充斥的大量血腥暴力色情，他回想道，许是来自“在社会中多年的压抑，德国读书时期大部分时间都在打工谋生，迫不得已去餐厅洗盘子，去工厂上夜班扛包，做着最底层的活。艺术什么的对我来讲没什么关系，当时首先是要吃饱饭活下来，第二个目标是尽快毕业，才能对家里有个交代。有了这个文凭才能谋生，才能干我要干的事情”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那几年的作品出现在大大小小的一些展览中，但收获的认可很少。“当时就想做跟西方有关系的事情，以为大家都能看懂，但其实通过几次展览，发现大家不知道我要干嘛呀，不知道来源。现在看起来那时就像是在那儿使劲大声地喊，特别强烈地吆喝，但也没有什么效果，还不如安静一点。如果说以前打的是浮于表面的花架子，现在打的都是内伤，就是不动声色，但其实气功已经穿透你的身体了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/Hxm6eYLC2cSPba4i9gtCjIUwz3t9kP9wVFjNhQ6A.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;795&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/Hxm6eYLC2cSPba4i9gtCjIUwz3t9kP9wVFjNhQ6A.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;大概从10年前开始，他的创作内容发生了极大变化。“慢慢转变是因为开始到山里走，拍一些跟自然有关的照片，感受更多，就想更回归到自己。之前的那些作品都是跟社会、跟别人有关，输出我对外界的一些认知，跟我自己没有太多关系。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刚开始转向自然时史国威追求的仍是形的相似与否，一丝不苟画得非常精细、非常隐晦，草本身是绿的，画出来还是绿的，只不过绿的程度可能跟彩色照片相比有微妙变化，那时他希望听见的，是观众猛一看，“哎，这不是彩色照片吗”的观感。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;近几年，他越来越向内，去一趟灵山，可能只拍一两张有感触的。2023年9月魔金石画廊的个展中，一些画作来自他在新疆、大兴安岭等地旅途中的拍摄，挑选时他越发严苛，“你会想这个场景是不是和我有关，它究竟值不值得。”覆盖的痕迹也越来越重，让人几乎难以看出原貌。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;岩石在他笔下被画成生肉一般的质感，再壮美的风景，透过他的双目，往往都转化为残酷的产物。宠物的死和亲人的过世萦绕在他心头，看到堆得像巨大蒙古包似的、等待羊毛贩子过来收购的羊毛，深棕、浅棕、黄色交缠在风中，牧民习以为常，他只觉得残忍；眼见鄂温克族猎手特别顺手地用20分钟解决一头鹿，他又想起十几岁时跟随父亲打猎后独自处理野兔（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;勾上门框、提刀、剥皮&lt;/span>;）的一幕幕，“当时看得既熟悉又难受，所以为什么我的画里一直有肉？有血？这种气息是贯穿始终的，只不过现在用得更稳定，不像十多年前那么大面积的血腥。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在同样做着艺术工作的妻子看来，这种染色之后的图像不是还原，而是比现实更主观，是对现实图景的怀疑和不满足。着色在现实上的虚构景观，意味着抛开过往摄影课上还原色卡、极致精准的训练，在“视而不见”中完成否认与逆反。他曾说，“这些年我一直不懈地尝试，试图打破摄影与绘画的边界，就像打破一道腐朽的墙。更确切地说，我正努力使自己游离在边缘线上，活像走钢丝的杂技演员保持着平衡，不倒向任何一边，无论摄影还是绘画。只有这样才能使我更加清醒和冷静地面对周遭的事物，使自己不迷失。就像河流的边缘总是长着比别处肥美的野草，那里的养分才最丰富。”&lt;/p>;

The average price of the selected drugs was reduced by 58%, and it is expected to save 18.2 billion yuan in drug costs every year. Pharmaceutical companies actively participated in this centralized procurement, with 382 products from 262 companies participating in the bidding. 266 products from 205 companies are eligible to be selected, including 260 products from 200 domestic pharmaceutical companies and 6 products from 5 international pharmaceutical companies (including 1 original research drug and 5 imported generic drugs). The winning rate is about 78%, with an average of 6.5 companies for each category planning to be selected. This centralized procurement has a high selection rate for enterprises, and has a good effect on reducing the burden on the masses, achieving a balance between the multiple goals of &quot;reducing burdens, promoting development, and ensuring supply.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This centralized purchase covers medications for common and chronic diseases such as infections, tumors, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, and mental illnesses, as well as key drugs such as emergency drugs and shortage drugs. Lenalidomide capsules for the treatment of multiple myeloma will be included in the centralized procurement in time after the patent expires in May 2023. The average price of each capsule (25 mg) has been reduced from about 200 yuan to 15 yuan, which can save about 3,880 yuan in monthly drug costs. Patients The burden is significantly reduced. The prices of three nationally focused drugs monitored for rational use, including rabeprazole oral sustained-release dosage form and esomeprazole magnesium enteric-coated dry suspension for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, have been significantly reduced. Five kinds of shortage drugs and emergency drugs, including amiodarone injection to treat arrhythmia, dopamine injection to rescue shock, and oxytocin injection to induce labor, have been used to stabilize corporate expectations through the &quot;volume-based&quot; procurement method to ensure supply and Balance of multiple objectives for reasonable price reduction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2018, the National Medical Insurance Administration has organized and carried out nine batches of nationally organized drug procurement, including a total of 374 kinds of drugs, with an average reduction of more than 50%. In the next step, the National Medical Insurance Administration will work with relevant departments to guide various localities and selected companies to implement the winning results to ensure that patients across the country can use the selected products after the price reduction of this centralized purchase in March 2024. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 07 Nov 2023 08:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“吃不完剩下点很正常”？节约习惯还得从小塑成丨养儿育女]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260019]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-06 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;As a working mother, I always believe that it is important to prepare a hearty, delicious and nutritious meal for my second-grade son every day. The rich and satisfying breakfast was indeed a &quot;big job&quot;. Recently, in the morning, I followed my child&#39;s request and packed breakfast for him at the bakery or community cafeteria downstairs. When I came home in the evening, I found that he always had more than half of a hamburger or rice ball left. I curiously asked him why he wasted some food every day, and he answered me nonchalantly: &quot;It&#39;s normal not to be able to finish the rest!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After listening to the child&#39;s words, I gave him a detailed calculation. An economic account: If he wastes 9 yuan a day, 63 yuan a week, and 252 yuan a month, he wastes more than 3,000 yuan a year. This money can buy a good mobile phone, a A branded washing machine can also cover the living expenses of a poor rural person for a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The child was extremely shocked by what he said. He sighed repeatedly, &quot;Mom, before you calculated this account for me, I never thought that if you waste a little bit every day, you would lose so much. I will ask you to buy less in the future, please remember it!&quot; Seeing the sincerity on his face, I couldn&#39;t help but sigh, modern children&#39;s awareness of thrift really needs to be cultivated from an early age! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is true that today’s favorable material living conditions can easily cause children to lack the concept of money. From childhood, when you open your mouth to eat or stretch out your hands when wearing clothes, if you open your mouth to ask for anything, parents will satisfy you without reservation. Some parents even feel that they suffered too much in childhood and have not experienced many fun in childhood, so they feel that they cannot be owed anything. child. Over time, mentally retarded children will no longer know where money comes from, let alone how difficult it is to make money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, wrong guidance from parents is also the main reason why children have no concept of money. With the development of modern technology, people tend to use mobile payment instead of cash payment. During e-commerce festivals such as &quot;6·18&quot; and &quot;Double 11&quot;, many parents &quot;buy, buy, buy&quot; regardless of whether it is useful or not. Behind the convenient and fast payment, children cannot feel what money is, and they will not ask &quot;how much money does my family have&quot; or &quot;how much money can my parents earn in a day&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, the limitations of school education methods are also an important reason for children&#39;s lack of money concepts and awareness of saving. I believe that all schools will warn children to develop the habit of thrifting from an early age, but it is obviously difficult to exert their due effect by admonishing and urging children. Of course, it is also difficult to arouse children&#39;s empathy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We all know that children are in a critical period of forming their outlook on life. Proper guidance from parents and schools is particularly important for them to develop correct values. Because of this, as parents, we must first guide our children to establish a correct concept of money. Use plain and easy language to calculate accounts for children, so that they can concretely understand the concept of money and truly feel that money is hard-won. You might as well prepare a piggy bank for your children, let them save money and use it by themselves, and warn them not to buy and spend randomly. Take your children to participate in some social labor, let them experience the hardship and fun of making money, and let them realize that making money is not easy during labor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teaching by words and deeds is worse than words and deeds. Parents are role models for children to follow. Good examples inspire people to make progress, but bad examples can cause endless harm. As parents, we ourselves must develop a good habit of saving, teach our children why we need to save and how to develop a good habit of saving in every aspect of our lives, tell them that money should be spent wisely, and then create a culture of spending money when it is appropriate and being thrifty and thrifty. family atmosphere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no doubt that school education and social guidance are also extremely important for children to develop thrifty habits. In school education, we carry out themed study activities such as &quot;Spend January with 100 Yuan&quot;, organize children to go to rural poverty-stricken areas to experience life and feel poverty, so that they can truly understand that making money is not easy and life is difficult, and encourage them to develop thrift. virtue. At the same time, mass media such as radio and television should also promote the &quot;new trend of frugality on the dining table&quot; and encourage everyone to promote traditional virtues. We can also encourage children from developed areas in the east to pair up and help each other with children from poor areas in the central and western regions, so that the &quot;little princesses&quot; and &quot;little princes&quot; living in honey pots can use their own actions to help children in poor areas realize their &quot;dream of going to school&quot; and &quot;seeking knowledge&quot; &quot;Dream&quot; to promote common growth and let the &quot;little princesses&quot; and &quot;little princes&quot; truly realize the great role of saving. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（作者为浙江衢州公务员）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（南方周末App“hi，南周”栏目之“养儿育女”，欢迎来信分享为人父母师长的你在孩子成长路上经过的风景和领悟的道理。投稿邮箱：nfzmreaders@163.com）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 06 Nov 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
