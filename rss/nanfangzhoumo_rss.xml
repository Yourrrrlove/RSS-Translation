This year has the largest number of references for Chinese car companies in history. Not only BYD, Xpeng Motors, Leap Motors, SAIC MG, Avita and Cyrus participated in the exhibition, but also CATL, Yiwei Lithium Energy and so on. , Sunwoda and China New Aviation and other parts, software and hardware suppliers. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China&#39;s electric cars, which are rapidly entering the market, have encountered &quot;stumbling blocks.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, in the first eight months of 2023, China&#39;s new energy vehicle exports surged 110% year-on-year. However, on September 13, 2023, European Commission President von der Leyen announced that it would launch a countervailing investigation into electric vehicles from China. The core of the investigation is whether the Chinese government provides subsidies to assess whether the EU needs to impose punitive tariffs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Qiu Kaijun, founder of &quot;Electric Vehicle Observer&quot; believes that all countries are introducing policies to support the development of their own electric vehicle industry, and China just implemented subsidies earlier, and there is no legitimacy issue. Moreover, China’s “state subsidy” policy for new energy vehicles has been terminated in 2022, but some EU member states are still subsidizing their own new energy vehicles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 14, a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce of China responded that China’s electric vehicle industry has developed rapidly and its competitiveness has continued to improve. This is the result of unremitting technological innovation and the construction of a complete industrial chain and supply chain. China urges the EU to proceed from the overall situation of maintaining the stability of global industrial and supply chains as well as the China-EU comprehensive strategic partnership and engage in dialogue and consultation with China. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;China’s “state subsidy” policy for electric vehicles has been withdrawn&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“The global market is now flooded with cheaper Chinese electric vehicles. And huge state subsidies have artificially depressed their prices.” Von der Leyen said that this is the core reason why the EU is considering launching a countervailing investigation into electric vehicles from China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The European Commission said that China’s market share of electric vehicles sold in Europe has risen to 8% and may reach 15% in 2025. This rapid growth in proportion is due to the fact that Chinese electric vehicles generally have a price advantage of about 20% compared to European models. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Chinese government does provide subsidies for electric vehicles, but it also set up an exit mechanism for subsidies very early. At the beginning of 2022, four departments including the Ministry of Finance jointly issued a document clarifying that the new energy vehicle purchase subsidy policy in 2022 will be terminated on December 31, 2022. Subsidies will no longer be provided for vehicles with subsequent license plates, and the &quot;state subsidy&quot; policy for electric vehicles that has continued for 13 years has been officially Withdrew from the stage of history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at Europe, many subsidy policies for the electric vehicle industry have been introduced in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, Germany provides different subsidies for pure electric vehicles based on the selling price, with the maximum subsidy of 4,500 euros for models under 40,000 euros. In 2023, the car purchase subsidy for ordinary French consumers will be 5,000 euros, and the electric vehicle subsidy for low-income families will increase to 7,000 euros. On February 1, 2023, the European Commission proposed increasing state subsidies to enable EU countries to compete with other countries in the production of electric vehicles and other green products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In the development of emerging industries such as electric vehicles, the industrial policies of various countries are very active, but there are differences in degree.&quot; Qiu Kaijun said, &quot;In the early years, the so-called completely free market did not interfere with industrial development at all. The economic theory is actually no longer popular in Europe and the United States, where there is also strong intervention and support for emerging industries.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The impact on Chinese car companies still needs to be observed&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to According to EU regulations, countervailing investigations can take up to 13 months, which means that we still need to wait for the &quot;boots to land&quot; in about a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But on the evening of September 13, Chinese concept stocks of new energy vehicles had already fallen collectively. Xpeng Motors fell 3.11%, Li Auto fell 0.54%, and NIO fell 4.64%. Hong Kong auto stocks fell in late trading, with BYD and Xpeng Motors falling 3.53% and 2.47% respectively, Geely Auto falling 1.52%, and Great Wall Motors, NIO, and Li Auto falling slightly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the launch of the anti-subsidy investigation, European policies were relatively friendly, with a tariff of 10% on cars imported from China, while the United States&#39; tariff was 27.5%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Kaijun said that the current cost advantage of Chinese car companies is very obvious. If countervailing tariffs are imposed after the investigation, the increase will be small, and Chinese car companies will still be competitive; but if punitive tariffs are imposed, such as 100% or 150%, the blow will be very severe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Forsighted Chinese car companies are preparing to build factories in Europe, and the anti-subsidy investigation may speed up their progress in building factories. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Dan, a researcher at the Institute of International Affairs of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen), suggested that Chinese car companies should strengthen coordination and consultation with the assistance of industry associations, form a joint stance and strategy, and improve the foreign economic and trade legal toolbox , accurately grasp EU legislative information and progress, work closely with the Ministry of Commerce, and negotiate with the European side in the China-EU high-level economic and trade dialogue. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;China has the best electric vehicle industry chain&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Many foreign car companies have factories in China, and the so-called electric vehicles from China also include them. Countervailing investigations will also affect non-Chinese brand models manufactured in China, such as Tesla and BMW. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Foreign brands are willing to set up factories in China, and they are voting with their feet. It is not because China has subsidies, but because China has the best electric vehicle industry chain and good automobile industry workers, just like the Ma Skoda praised the workers at Tesla&#39;s Shanghai Gigafactory for being smart and hard-working,&quot; Qiu Kaijun said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 13, the China Chamber of Commerce in the European Union issued a statement that China&#39;s electric vehicles and upstream and downstream industry chain companies have continued to innovate and have accumulated overall industrial advantages in the fierce Chinese local market. This advantage is not based on The so-called huge subsidies are formed. CITIC Securities’ research report also pointed out that China’s current electric vehicles do not rely on low prices as a selling point. Their competitiveness comes from technology accumulation, quality control, and user experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The industrial advantage is reflected in the price advantage. Qiu Kaijun gave an example to Southern Weekend reporters. Volkswagen&#39;s ID.3 model is produced in both China and Germany. It sells for 40,000 euros in Germany, while it sells for about 15,000 euros in China. The huge price difference has caused caused a wave of public opinion in Germany. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a statistics from the research organization JATO Dynamics, since 2015, the average price of electric vehicles in Europe has risen from 49,000 euros to 56,000 euros, and in the United States from 53,000 euros to 64,000 euros, while China dropped from 67,000 euros to 32,000 euros. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/sgbOXPSp4wVLuSzSIK5Atygt7XfxqiISz85gHrFJ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1086&quot; height= &quot;723&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/sgbOXPSp4wVLuSzSIK5Atygt7XfxqiISz85gHrFJ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250982&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 23, 2023 local time, in Debrecen, Hungary, an electric vehicle battery factory invested by China Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Ltd. (CATL) is under construction. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The road to sea is long and difficult&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This time the EU imposes restrictions on electric vehicles from China The anti-subsidy investigation launched by automobiles reminds people of the &quot;double-reverse&quot; (anti-dumping and countervailing) investigation conducted by the EU on photovoltaic modules exported from China in 2012. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Kaijun introduced that when China&#39;s photovoltaic industry emerged, it was commonly known as &quot;three heads outside&quot;, that is, raw materials, technology, and markets were all abroad, with China as the main processing place, and it developed from this. China’s photovoltaic industry suffered a huge blow during the “double-reverse” investigation. However, it was also at this stage that China’s photovoltaic industry fully tapped its endogenous power and localized raw materials, technology, and markets. When the “double-reverse” investigation After the investigation was withdrawn, it regained a large market share. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development path of the electric vehicle industry is different from that of the photovoltaic industry. China&#39;s electric vehicles originated in the local market and then went abroad after developing to a certain extent. The current market penetration rate of China&#39;s new energy vehicles is about 35%, and there is still a huge domestic market demand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This EU countervailing investigation also sounded the alarm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Dan believes that the EU’s launch of a countervailing investigation on electric vehicles from China is a typical trade protectionism and a manifestation of the EU’s double standards. It is completely untenable both legally and morally. Currently, there are huge differences within the EU regarding this anti-subsidy investigation. The political forces within Germany and France both support and oppose it. However, in the current political environment, the supporting forces within Germany and France have the ability to push the EU to launch an investigation and even influence it. Investigation conclusion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in addition to facing the obstacles of trade protectionism, Wu Dan believes that factors such as the inconsistency between China&#39;s national automobile standards and international standards, the fact that my country&#39;s new energy vehicle export certification system has not yet been integrated with international standards, and the decline in overseas consumption capacity are all constraints. It has promoted the international development of my country’s new energy vehicles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Dan once wrote that at the current stage, the scale of overseas investment and factory establishment by Chinese car companies is far less than that of traditional multinational car manufacturers in developed countries. Chinese car companies want to transform from a traditional trade model to an overseas business development model. Improving the autonomy and brand influence of the supporting supply chain still has to go through a long and difficult process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 17 Sep 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[恒大财富杜某等涉嫌犯罪人员被采取刑事强制措施]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256870]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 23:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/sz_mmbiz_jpg/Dm1HIR5mtBCpZsNIdQqubPCVicQZnZDBHsmns7gVm9iav5GtKbUibVljN4L3I5fNFCpHzw LxUYWrW5bEH9Kia5nIBw/640?wx_fmt= jpeg&amp;amp;wxfrom=5&amp;amp;wx_lazy=1&amp;amp;wx_co=1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 0.5;&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;https://mmbiz.qpic. cn/sz_mmbiz_jpg/Dm1HIR5mtBCpZsNIdQqubPCVicQZnZDBHsmns7gVm9iav5GtKbUibVljN4L3I5fNFCpHzwLxUYWrW5bEH9Kia5nIBw/640?wx_fmt=jpeg&amp;amp;wxfrom=5&amp;amp;wx_lazy=1 &amp;amp;wx_co=1&quot; data-key=&quot;media-1694873788117-0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 23:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[走近霍尔果斯“守关人”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256824]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/13/FqInwUqfJtlhA5sf3cCHzxzSO15M5p9oKUr1J14C.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;539&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/FqInwUqfJtlhA5sf3cCHzxzSO15 M5p9oKUr1J14C. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250554&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Police monitor China-Europe trains leaving the country at night&lt;span style=&quot;color: # aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Jia/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At 10 o&#39;clock in the evening, the sun has just set, the rails and stones are still hot, and the high temperature emitted by the train engine is uncomfortable.

In July 2012, Yue Shuang, who had just graduated from the military academy, was assigned to the Horgos Border Inspection Station. At that time, this border town had a sparse population. Most shops were closed after 10 p.m., and “there were no people eating noodles on the street.” There is no place.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/qjKUBwucyDgNE2lVo40qHUiVplDQZLmcvakaf6S3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width= &quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/qjKUBwucyDgNE2lVo40qHUiVplDQZLmcvakaf6S3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250557&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt; p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Before going to work, Yue Shuang checks the police appearance and discipline&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Jia/picture)&lt;/span >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On December 22, 2012, the Horgos Railway Port opened for trial operation. Yue Shuang was among the first batch of policemen stationed at the scene. There were only four railway tracks, one guard bridge and a temporary structure in the vast Gobi. color steel house. According to the agreement between China and Kazakhstan, the railway port implemented a 7-day × 12-hour service model at that time, but there were only seven or eight inbound and outbound freight trains every day. Yue Shuang used &quot;boring&quot; to describe the work at that time, &quot;There was not much business volume, but it was very tiring.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The change occurred in 2014, when the railway port was officially opened in February of that year. Yue Shuang still remembers that the number of trains that summer more than doubled than before, and the number continued to grow. The background of this change is that China proposed the joint construction of the &quot;Belt and Road&quot; initiative in 2013, and Horgos is located in the &quot;core area&quot; of the &quot;New Silk Road Economic Belt&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/WO9Y5ktr951A1xtFgbFggEZnfeaSqjKbqpjUGkbj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/WO9Y5ktr951A1xtFgbFggEZnfeaSqjKbqpjUGkbj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250553&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Check the front of the truck to prevent hiding illegal items&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Jia/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huo Ergos means &quot;the place where the camel caravan passes&quot; in Mongolian.

The police had to climb into the carriages one by one and check the bottom of the carriages to prevent criminals or prohibited items from hiding in them and illegal entry and exit. It took more than half an hour to inspect a train. Later, they formed a mature inspection process, strengthened technological means, and carried out comprehensive monitoring of inbound and outbound trains. Now it only takes about 10 minutes to inspect a train. In order to better adapt to the growing demand for customs clearance, the border inspection station has adjusted the railway port to a 365-day × 24-hour service model, so that entry and exit trains can be inspected and released at any time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/1eF7ZbQvGlj1T8fCvN2CBPnzdGYnDZDn2hnXiIRB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;607&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/1eF7ZbQvGlj1T8fCvN2CBPnzdGYnDZDn2hnXiIRB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250561&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Check the identity of the outbound truck driver&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Jia/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Spring and Autumn Return Well, the most difficult parts are summer and winter.&quot; Yue Shuang said that the highest temperature in summer at the duty site is over 50 degrees Celsius, eggs can be fried on the railway tracks, and people often faint at the duty site; in winter, the lowest temperature drops to more than 30 degrees below zero. degrees Celsius, when the police inspected the car, their hands were accidentally stuck to the iron sheet of the carriage. If they tore it apart with force, bloody skin and flesh would be left on the carriage. In December 2018, the port encountered a blizzard with more than 70 centimeters of snow. In order not to affect the normal operation of the train, the police cleared the snow all night long. Everyone was covered with thick ice when they returned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To the northwest of the railway port, about two kilometers away in a straight line, stands the sixth-generation national gate that was opened in September 2018.

In his opinion, the design concept of the new national gate is more advanced. Passengers only need to scan their fingerprints and faces to clear customs in just 15 seconds; trucks adopt one-stop inspection and one-time customs clearance to improve customs clearance efficiency. From January 1 to July 21, 2023, the number of entry and exit vehicles at the port exceeded 100,000, exceeding the annual customs clearance volume of highway ports in previous years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There are many potential changes that cannot be seen at ordinary times.” Zeng Qi said. In the past, export commodities were mainly fruits and vegetables, department stores and various daily necessities, but now they include building materials, machinery and equipment, precision instruments, etc. Among them, Chinese-made new energy vehicles are especially popular with countries along the “Belt and Road”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/WKPqmSzsnAkezItMKQ5VwS3AhY40YNpCDOQrwJIm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/WKPqmSzsnAkezItMKQ5VwS3AhY40YNpCDOQrwJIm.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250555&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Vehicles of various types waiting to leave the country in front of the sixth-generation national gate&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Jia/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What touched Zeng Qi most deeply was one day in May 2023. As he was getting off work, there was still a long queue of vehicles waiting to clear customs. They urgently met and negotiated with the Kazakh border inspection department and obtained the other party&#39;s consent to extend the customs clearance time. When the news came, the drivers waiting for customs clearance in front of the boundary bridge applauded in unison. They worked until about 5 a.m. the next day, and finally completed the inspection and release of all vehicles to be inspected. &quot;Seeing so many Chinese products leaving us, no matter how tiring it is, it&#39;s worth it.&quot; On August 15, 2023, the Horgos Highway Port began to implement 24-hour freight customs clearance on a trial basis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023 is the tenth anniversary of the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative. With the continuous growth of port customs clearance, more and more tourists are visiting Horgos, and &quot;gold diggers&quot; from various countries are also pouring in. This border town is undergoing rapid changes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yue Shuang once went out of the country to meet with the Kazakh border inspection department, and it was already night when he returned. He stood in the dark wilderness outside the country and looked at Horgos. It was brightly lit and bustling with traffic, making it a veritable &quot;city that never sleeps.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[胡适与吴鼎昌父子刘廷芳兄弟：从吴元黎旧藏《四十自述》说起]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256625]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/13/LL1yxLVpALUNrKyeCE83Pod4zXgpgeFhBJuc4Sss.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;882&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/LL1yxLVpALUNrKyeCE83Pod4zXgpgeFhBJuc4Ss s. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250684&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hu Shi signed and presented Wu Yuanli&#39;s &quot;Autobiography of Forty&quot;. The picture on the right is young Wu Yuanli. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Liu Rongqian, who is far away in Canada, left me a message on WeChat not long ago: &quot;I am now eighty-six years old, so I should take advantage of the opportunity before I have dementia. &quot;I&#39;m going to sort out the relics left by my elders in the family. There are some old books among them. I chose three to give to you.&quot; He knew that I loved books, so he joked: &quot;A sword is given to a hero.&quot; It happened that a Chinese friend returned to China to visit relatives, and Liu My husband asked her to take it with her and deliver it to me when she got home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Within a few days, I received three books from Nantong: one was the 1935 edition of Kang Youwei&#39;s &quot;Book of Datong&quot; by Zhonghua Book Company. The front and back covers had fallen off, and the title page had the words &quot;Wu &quot;Huansheng&quot; is printed in white. One is the 1943 edition of Chiang Kai-shek&#39;s &quot;The Destiny of China&quot; by Zhengzhong Bookstore. There is a calligraphy inscription on the title page: &quot;Brother Zhao Jinyong Huicun, brother Liang Kui respectfully presents it.&quot; Zhao Jinyong and Liang Kui were both diplomats during the Republic of China. There is also a 1959 edition of Hu Shi&#39;s &quot;Autobiography at Forty&quot; published by Far East Book Company, which is actually signed by Hu Shi. The last invoice was made by Wu Yuanli, Mr. Liu Rongqian&#39;s uncle, and the invoice was signed on May 31, 1960. Inside the book is a copy of Mao Zishui&#39;s &quot;Three Years After the Death of Mr. Hu Shizhi&quot; published in the third issue of Volume 6 of &quot;Biographical Literature&quot;. This was beyond my expectation. I have been thinking about Hu Shi’s autographed book for a long time, but I didn’t expect that it was Mr. Liu Rongqian who helped me realize my dream. These three books were all collected by Wu Yuanli. Mr. Liu Rongqian told me that after his uncle (Editor&#39;s note: Wu Yuanli) passed away in the United States, he went to California to help his cousin deal with his uncle&#39;s belongings and asked for it from his cousin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Check the &quot;First Draft of the Long Chronicle of Mr. Hu Shizhi&quot; (Supplementary Edition) compiled by Hu Songping. It says on June 1, 1960: &quot;Wu Yuanli and Liu Tingwei came to see him. Yuanli was Wu Dingchang (Da). (Quan)’s son, let’s talk about Wu Tat-quan’s autobiography &quot;Huaxi Xianbi&quot;.&quot; It can be seen that Hu Shi prepared the book a day in advance, and the gift of &quot;Autobiography at Forty&quot; was also a thoughtful and meaningful move. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Shi and Wu Yuanli did not have a close relationship and may have only met once or twice. On June 19, 1949, they met in the United States. Hu Shi did not have too many records in his diary. He only wrote: &quot;5:30 &amp;nbsp;Mr. Wu (Son of Da Quan).&quot; At this time, the Nationalist Government had withdrawn from Nanjing and Hu Shi arrived in the United States. On June 21, Hu Shi telegraphed his resignation as Foreign Minister to the new Executive Yuan Yan Xishan, who was retreating to Guangzhou. But Hu Shi should have heard about Wu Yuanli&#39;s deeds. On the morning of July 1, 1959, he attended the fourth academician meeting of Academia Sinica and served as the chairman of the meeting. At the meeting, Jiang Shuojie reported on the research status of Chinese economists in the United States and mentioned many talents in economics, including Wu Yuanli. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/KQukqc6kLu6aOF9pBLBRSMm3uroyeMm8Jxnk6R1u.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;628&quot; height= &quot;1028&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/KQukqc6kLu6aOF9pBLBRSMm3uroyeMm8Jxnk6R1u.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250679&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wu Dingchang (back row, right), Chen Shiyun (middle seat) and his wife take a photo with their daughter Wu Yuanjun (back row, left), son-in-law Liu Tingwei (back row, center), and son Wu Yuanli (front row, right) . &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Yuanli was born in Shanghai in 1920. He studied at Shanghai Nanyang Middle School and St. John&#39;s University in his early years, and later went to England for further study. In 1942, he received a first-class honors degree in economics from the University of London. In 1946, he received a doctorate in economics and was a disciple of Hayek. After returning to China, he served in the Central Bank. In 1949, he moved to the United States and became a professor in the Department of Economics at the University of San Francisco. Chen Yuxian divided the Chinese experts who studied Sinology in North America into five major groups. The second group was &quot;around the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China. A group of scholars who studied or taught in church universities migrated to North America. They encountered the expansion of North American institutions of higher learning after World War II.&quot; Soon, they became fluent in both Chinese and English and settled in various universities, becoming the backbone of Chinese studies in each school.&quot; Wu Yuanli is the leader in this second group. Since 1960, Wu Yuanli has served as a researcher and consultant at the Hoover Institution of Stanford University. He used the rich collections of the Hoover Library to write books such as &quot;Overseas Chinese and the Economic Development of Southeast Asia&quot;, &quot;The Role of the Chinese in the Economic Development of Southeast Asia&quot; and &quot;Taiwan: Towards an Industrialized Society&quot;. Precisely because of Wu Yuanli&#39;s superb research on China issues, he served as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense of the United States from 1969 to 1970. In 1985, Wu Yuanli won the Humboldt Foundation Research Award in Germany. In November 2008, Wu Yuanli accidentally fell and caused intracranial hemorrhage. He died at Stanford University Hospital in California on the 18th at the age of 88. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/3BQKBU2VVI5x5r8qEWYPN7BSq3FboPaO0bFfSg1A.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1104&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/3BQKBU2VVI5x5r8qEWYPN7BSq3FboPaO0bFfSg1A.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250683&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A group photo of Wu and Liu families.

Provided by Liu Rongqian. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I asked Mr. Liu Rongqian what special impression he had on this uncle (Editor&#39;s note: Wu Yuanli)? He said that when he was a child, he lived with his grandparents in Guiyang (Editor&#39;s note: referring to Wu Dingchang and his wife, Wu was the chairman of Guizhou Province at the time). One day the postman delivered a silver-gray box with a piece of coffee cake and a lot of dried fruits. His grandmother told him this It was sent from London by my uncle, and I still haven&#39;t forgotten the sweet taste. After the war of resistance against Japan was over in Nanjing, his uncle brought back his aunt with blue eyes and blond hair. This was the first time he saw his uncle and the first time he talked directly to &quot;foreigners&quot;. He felt strange. Later, his uncle went to the United States, and his family went to live in Taiwan. In 1962, my grandmother passed away, and my uncle returned to Taiwan to attend the funeral. In 1965, he was studying in Paris. His uncle and aunt came to see him. They saw that he was studying design during the day and working in a hotel at night. His life was difficult. His uncle suggested that he go to the United States to study economics instead. It would be easier to find a job after graduation and it would also help He lends a helping hand. He answered his uncle: &quot;I can only draw.&quot; In 1965, Liu Rongqian immigrated to Canada. A few years later, he brought his parents to live in Canada. His uncle would come to visit relatives every year. After Mr. Liu&#39;s parents passed away, he often visited his uncle in California, chatted with him, and discussed the foundation to commemorate Wu Chen Shiyun (Editor&#39;s note: Wu Dingchang&#39;s wife). When his uncle passed away, he was in Beijing and did not have time to attend the funeral. Later, he went to California to help his cousin, who did not understand Chinese, organize a house full of Chinese books and materials. Mr. Liu said that his uncle kept a low profile throughout his life, moved and spoke softly, was good at listening and asking questions, and was very caring about his younger generations. &quot;Perhaps my uncle studied in England when he was young and was influenced by the British&#39;s cold humor. He would often make people laugh unexpectedly during conversations. I remember that in Paris that year, we were sitting in an outdoor cafe. He said that Paris was very interesting. Half of the Parisians were sitting there. Watching the other half of Paris in a cafe. If I could describe my impression of my uncle in one sentence: he is a gentleman with a sense of humor.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Shi and Wu Yuanli&#39;s father, Wu Dingchang, are old acquaintances and spoke highly of him. On February 26, 1931, Cao Heheng invited Ke Shaobin, Zheng Xiaoxu, Jiang Han, Yang Zhongxi and others to have dinner together. He also invited Wu Dingchang and Hu Shi. This was the first time they met. Hu Shi&#39;s diary recorded on that day: &quot;Wu Jun is a capable man. I have wanted to see him for a long time, but I have disagreed many times. Today I met him for the first time.&quot; Wu Dingchang is seven or eight years older than Hu Shi. He is an industrialist and banker and has served as the Bank of China. President, General Manager of Salt Bank, and Deputy Minister of Finance of the Beijing Government. Later, he acquired &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot; and appointed himself as president. He invited Hu Zhengzhi as general manager and Zhang Jiluan as editor-in-chief, giving &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot; a new life and becoming one of the most influential newspapers in the country. Therefore, Hu Shi was left with a &quot;competent&quot; impression. In November of that year, the Nanjing National Government established a Finance Committee, with Hu Shi and Wu Dingchang as members. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/gvp2av25spnjzLea2PNQn5ygS6DkCvKHe2kwJAk4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;479&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/gvp2av25spnjzLea2PNQn5ygS6DkCvKHe2kwJAk4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250682&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Liu Tingwei and Wu Yuanjun wedding photos. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of Liu Rongqian)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 11, 1933, on the eve of Hu Shi’s visit to the United States, he passed through Tianjin. Wu Dingchang went to visit specifically. They &quot;talked for more than two o&#39;clock&quot;, and Wu Dingchang &quot;advocated &#39;returning power to the people&#39; the most vigorously, and also advocated the temporary suspension of many construction projects.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On January 31, 1934, Hu Shi and Wu Dingchang met at Wang Jingwei&#39;s official residence in Nanjing. Also present were Zhang Jiluan, Ren Hongjun, Chen Hengzhe, Tang Youren, Zeng Zhongming, etc. They discussed foreign and domestic issues. . The meaning is still not finished. After leaving, Hu Shi and Wu Dingchang talked late at night when they returned to their apartment. At that time, Sino-Japanese relations were becoming increasingly tense, and there were many different voices regarding foreign and domestic policies. Hu Shi and Wu Dingchang obviously had different opinions, but this did not affect Hu Shi&#39;s good impression of Wu Dingchang. In July of that year, Hu Shi wrote &quot;From Private School to Yenching University&quot;. When talking about private donations to build schools, he cited the example of Wu Dingchang: &quot;Those with more money can renovate a university. ... Those with less money can also subsidize a specific school.&quot; A certain part, such as Mr. Wu Dingchang’s donation to the Department of Economics of Nankai University for student aid. In this way, a small amount can add up to a large amount, making the already successful school become even more successful.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Shi, Wu Yuanli and Liu Tingwei The &quot;Huaxi Xianbi&quot; mentioned was written by Wu Dingchang when he was the chairman of the Guizhou Provincial Government. It was published by Guizhou Daily in October 1940. It has &quot;when taking office&quot;, &quot;after taking office&quot;, &quot;province&quot; and &quot;county&quot;. There are seven chapters in &quot;Central Administration and Local Governments&quot;, &quot;Miscellaneous Thoughts&quot; and &quot;Postscript&quot;. Three years later, Hu Zhengzhi persuaded Wu Dingchang to continue writing &quot;Huaxi Xianbi&quot;, so there were nine chapters in the &quot;Continuation&quot;, namely &quot;Provincial Government&quot;, &quot;Counties and Towns&quot;, &quot;New County System&quot;, &quot;Counties and Townships&quot;, &quot;New Life&quot;, &quot;Public Security and Gangs&quot;, &quot;Economy and Control&quot;, &quot;Finance and Accounting&quot; and &quot;Miscellaneous Feelings&quot; were published by Guizhou Enterprise Co., Ltd. Printing Office in October 1943. Wu Dingchang ran a newspaper, and it is said that his poetry and prose were very good. Cao Juren said: &quot;I read the sequel to his &quot;Huaxi Xianbi&quot; and liked his simplicity and closeness. His female son-in-law collected his poems and distributed them to the best. After reading them, I felt that there were no empty scholars in his name. After leaving Guizhou, Wu Dingchang served as the civil servant of the National Government, Secretary-General of the Central Design Bureau of the Kuomintang, and Secretary-General of the Presidential Office. He once suggested to Chiang Kai-shek that he invite Mao Zedong to Chongqing for negotiations. In January 1949, retired Wu Dingchang came to live in Hong Kong at the urging of his son. On August 22, 1950, Wu Dingchang died of cancer in Hong Kong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/WrMFUIDTySoVmp3a1GM2tmUVYsCQiSp4eHl8e3wK.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;610&quot; height= &quot;927&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/WrMFUIDTySoVmp3a1GM2tmUVYsCQiSp4eHl8e3wK.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250681&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Brothers Liu Tingfang (left) and Liu Tingwei (right). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of Liu Rongqian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Tingwei, who went to visit Hu Shi with Wu Yuanli, was not introduced in Hu Shi&#39;s diary. Liu Tingwei is the son-in-law of Wu Dingchang and the father of Mr. Liu Rongqian. He was born in 1903 and was a native of Wenzhou, Zhejiang. After graduating from Yanjing University, he studied at Cornell University in the United States and received a doctorate in entomology. After completing his studies, he returned to China and served successively as professor in the Department of Biology of Hujiang University, technical director of the Nanjing Central Agricultural Experimental Institute, technical director of the Guizhou Work Station of the Central Agricultural Experimental Institute, and technical director of the Agricultural Group of the Agricultural Society. After the Agricultural Restoration Association moved to Taiwan in 1949, Liu Tingwei served as the leader of the first group and later the plant production group until his retirement in 1965. Liu Tingwei is also a poet. His poems are highly praised by Tao Xingzhi, Xu Zhimo and Shen Congwen. He has published poetry collections &quot;Mountain Flowers&quot; and &quot;My Cup&quot;.其妻吴元俊乃吴鼎昌长女，一九一二年生，曾就读于燕京大学，与周一良同学，颇有才华，在校时协助容庚编《金文续编》。曹聚仁说的为吴鼎昌印诗集的女儿就是吴元俊。刘廷蔚吴元俊于一九三三年七月结婚，相濡以沫一辈子。晚年，他们随儿女在加拿大、美国生活。一九九四年一月，刘廷蔚在加拿大去世。二〇〇一年十二月，吴元俊在美国去世。两人都活到九十多岁。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;胡适与刘廷蔚没有什么直接的交集，但对他的大哥刘廷芳却是很熟悉的。刘廷芳少年之时就深得苏慧廉、蔡博敏、司徒雷登等人的赏识，司徒雷登更是推荐他到上海圣约翰大学深造，后又安排他赴美留学。刘廷芳在美先后获哥伦比亚大学学士、硕士学位，耶鲁大学神学院神学士学位，哥伦比亚大学教育心理学博士学位。回国后，与司徒雷登一道在燕京大学工作，是司徒雷登开创燕大事业的重要助手。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/kzPxt48fnGol2uq1muiA1nHoLJfOKkF0tqevZMwr.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;晚年吴元黎。上世纪四十年代，吴元黎主张赋予穷人权利，由他们自由发展。另一位著名经济学家方显廷则主张依靠精英的规划发展经济，由精英替穷人作主，两人的争论以方显廷得势而告终。吴元黎退走美国，名字渐渐被人遗忘。直到2007年，美国的经济思想史学者保罗·特雷斯科特才重新发现了吴元黎，认为吴方论战是发展经济学史上最早的论战。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（资料图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;胡适日记里最早关于刘廷芳的记载在一九二一年四月二十八日：“到刘廷芳家吃饭。刘君治宗教学，家藏宗教史的书甚多。”同年五月十八日：“上午，司徒尔先生与刘廷芳牧师与霍进德先生来谈。”同年六月三十日，北京大学、男女两高师、尚志学会、新学会等在中央公园今雨轩为杜威一家饯行，胡适与刘廷芳、吴卓生夫妇都在。胡适代表北大致词，自己译成汉语又讲了一次。吴卓生代表女高师致词，则由刘廷芳翻译成汉语。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一九二一年时，燕京大学想改良国文部，司徒雷登、刘廷芳邀请胡适去主持工作，但胡适没有同意，而是推荐周作人去。他认为周作人在北大用非所长，很可惜，所以让他“出去独当一面”。不巧周氏病了，此事就搁置了一年。次年，燕京方面又提起此事，故一九二二年三月四日，胡适邀司徒雷登、刘廷芳、周作人来，为他们做介绍，让他们自己当面谈。胡适日记记道：“他们谈的很满意。”周作人在燕大教了十来年书，直到被北大聘为研究教授，不能兼外校课程。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一九三七年一月十一日，胡适“到燕大刘廷芳吃饭”。此后胡适日记再无刘廷芳出现。刘廷芳后来当选为立法委员，但因身体状况一直欠佳，一九四二年赴美就医，一九四七年逝世于新墨西哥州一家长老会医院，享年五十六岁。不知胡适与刘廷蔚见面时，有否想起他的哥哥刘廷芳。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘荣黔先生现生活于加拿大魁北克省蒙特利尔市，一直邀请我去游玩。 “别忘了我这年纪已经在倒数计时了，请尽早成行。”而我却想，他应趁现在还能走动，早点回家看看。刘荣黔久居海外，从未到过老家温州。二〇一五年五月，他在杭州举办“无意之境”摄影艺术展，我去观摩学习，匆匆一面。幸好还有微信，分别后我们可以随时网上交流。那是刘荣黔先生离老家最近的一次。几个月前，南京大学沈卫威教授来温州大学讲座之便，让我陪他去寻访刘廷芳旧踪。那一带正进行历史街区改造，刘廷芳回国后为他母亲建的小洋房已不得入。沈教授透过一幢办公楼里的卫生间窗户才看到刘氏故居一角。所以，请刘荣黔先生“尽早成行”吧。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;重金请来世界级名帅统军，加上归化球员NBA球星李凯尔加盟，中国男篮史上最大投入却换来本届世界杯上一胜四负，创下史上最差战绩的同时再度失去奥运会入场券，跌入深渊。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中国男篮在上个奥运周期表现不佳，未能获得东京奥运参赛资格，此番再失巴黎奥运会参赛资格，意味着一代球员在自己的竞技黄金时期不能参与最高级别赛事的竞争。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以往参加奥运会，中国代表团的旗手都会由身材高大、样貌俊朗的中国男篮名将担任。而今，连续缺席两届奥运的中国男篮甚至已经失去了能够指引方向的旗手——未能随队出征的老将易建联在中国男篮小组赛最后一场比赛前宣布退役，球迷哀叹，从奥运前八到八年不能参赛，中国男篮的荣光彻底褪去了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中国男篮该如何继续前行？ 《南方人物周刊》专访了中国篮球名帅宫鲁鸣。 1996年亚特兰大奥运会上，39岁的他指挥中国队首次打进奥运前八，这是迄今未被打破的最佳战绩，这批球员也被称为“96黄金一代”。 2014年中国男篮跌入低谷时，他受命出山，一年后再次将中国男篮带回亚洲第一。这位身高只有1米72的传奇后卫被称为中国篮球的“救火大师”。 1999年，他在中国女篮失去悉尼奥运会参赛资格的最低谷出任主帅，通过大换血和全方位的队伍建设，打造出一支青春勇猛的女篮黄金一代，连夺2001女篮亚锦赛、2002年亚运会两个桂冠，并在2002世锦赛上斩获第六名。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以下是宫鲁鸣教练的自述：&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;1&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;我个人非常赞同中国篮球加强国际交流，中国篮协聘请外籍教练，尤其是国外名帅来执教是一件好事，无论是在对抗上、理念上、方法上都可以带给我们很多很好的经验。但教练团队如何合理配搭、怎样充分发挥外教的作用，还是要考虑到一些现实因素。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;国外教练员的特长是职业素养高、专注、认真，他们的执教水平也一定是达到了相当的高度才会被中国篮协选中的，这些都是毋庸置疑的。他们大多数成长于一个职业化程度较高的篮球环境中，认为包括自己在内，队伍上下都具备足够的职业精神。集结一支国家队之后，外教很少会认为这支队伍的建设管理、运动员技能的提高也是主教练的工作重点之一。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;他们更多习惯将注意力放在场上，比方说战术体系、阵容配置、对手研究等等，其他很多事，他会认为那是你运动员自己的事儿，或者说一个成熟的职业运动员自己早就应该解决了的问题。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;外教做主教练的时候，虽然都会给他们配备优秀的中方教练做助手，但是基本上外籍主教练很少会跟中方教练深入交流、主动沟通。实话实说，他们也不一定看得上我们的中方教练，所以我们会看到外籍主教练很投入，也非常敢于开展工作，但是中外教练正式交换意见或者交流的机会很少。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;从我们的过往经验看，如果外教作为助教，他就会和主教练主动地进行交流，会把他看到的、收集到的各种信息，以及应对办法，主动地跟中方教练组交流沟通。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;这么多年来，无论是国家队还是地方俱乐部，我们的篮球界形成了一个这样的执教环境：除非中方教练非常主动，积极配合外教、向外教请教，他可能会跟中方教练多说一点，如果你不做这些，你只跟着外教，他其实是不会给你任何帮助的。但如果中方是主教练，外教就会把他的经验知识或者是方法手段，主动地与你交流，这就是一个很现实的事儿，这么多年已经形成了这样一种执教文化。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;还有一点，即便没有外教，教练组全部是本土教练，我们的教练圈里也有一个不成文的规定，习惯于听从主教练的安排，简单说，你不安排事我就不干，主教练发话了，安排我，我再去干。如果主教练不要求，那么助理教练都是不会轻易发表意见的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;这些都是我们的“篮球文化”，请外教必须考虑这些现实因素，其实很长时间圈内是有共识的，就是外教可以用，球也可以输，但是主动权必须掌握在我们自己手中，就是输，也要让我们自己的教练输得明白。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/O4yeTzwTaxr80Zv1c1vc6sHZGmgOxdACXvM7x0pw.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;把外教请进来，不能把自己的东西都丢了。你自己的东西是几代人积累出来的，适合自己的人员特质和具体环境，这些经验都是经过了具体实践的检验的。你不可能完全跟着别人跑就能成功的。补我们的短板，发展自己的特长，才是根本。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;有些话听上去有些过时，但我还是要说，我始终坚持队伍建设要重视思想工作。所谓思想工作并不是什么空洞的长篇大论，在日常的工作要求和业务学习中就可以结合很多东西讲一讲。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;外教是不管队伍建设的，他也不会做这种思想工作，大赛前他往那一站拎着个球衣说你们要对得起这上面的国旗，这就算他给队员做的思想工作了。一个人的头脑思想没有这么简单，你为什么打篮球？这个职业对你有什么基本的素养要求？再往上说，你对自己所处的时代有什么具体的认识？这个具体的时代背景又对你自己和体育这个行业提出了哪些要求？你不能头脑空空地拿球。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;不只是国家队缺乏有质量的思想工作，我们现在的职业联赛，有人会做思想教育工作吗？一个篮球职业运动员在当今的大环境里应当起什么样的社会作用？有几个人能够回答？我们搞职业化，球员的薪资待遇是上去了，但思想认识没有跟上。运动员是需要引导的，听到人们批评中国男篮“男足化”，这样的说法让我们做篮球和足球工作的都面上无光。老话说，“一日为师终身为父”，“子不教父之过”，从俱乐部到国家队，我们的教练、领队是否尽到了影响、教育年轻人的责任？队员有问题肯定是在管理教育上面，在国家队没人教育他，回到地方更没人教育他，天天都是晃晃悠悠的，甚至求着他，哄着他，对吧？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;教练其实是个苦行僧。你要想当好教练，你必须专注，要放弃很多爱好。你平时没事交一群朋友，这边训着练，那边安排晚上干什么去，那哪儿成？当队员你管好自己就行了，当教练你得考虑全队的事，全队的事就不是一件两件的事了。队伍的组建、上下沟通、家长沟通、思想问题、技术问题，全队的攻防体系建设、对手研究，一天24小时连轴转你都忙不过来，还有时间忙别的去？不专注根本解决不了这些问题。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;一个人必须尊重自己的工作，这是你赖以生存或者是你吃饭的家伙。我带中国女篮的时候，一直用一个瓷碗吃饭，就是提醒自己，你得爱护好自己的饭碗，别打了，打了以后没饭吃了。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;无论是明星运动员还是教练员，都应该恪守本分，不能为了彰显个性去牺牲体育运动阳光、健康、正向的核心价值。过去国家队完成集训或比赛任务、队员回俱乐部之前，我们都是要给他们提要求的，回去后你要体现国家队队员的水平和价值，要以身作则，在各方面都要起好的带头作用，而不是回去耍大牌。联赛里每个人还有针对性的要解决的技术问题，回来后我们是要检查的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;一位中山出租车司机面色笃定，下了判断。路上，他谈起这所坐落在中山市五桂山脚下的桂南学校，言下之意，这所民办中小学，升学率一般。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同样的故事听得太多了。设计师兼学校美术组老师张耀仁也只得无奈一笑，到底什么是好，什么是坏？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“成绩”总是大部分人的唯一标尺。张耀仁不这么想。他身材消瘦，五十多岁，来桂南学校五年多了。老P，人们爱这么喊他，他是河南人，在广东待了三十多年，前几年定居附近的旗溪村，与桂南学校校长石磊在这个话题上一拍即合：“乡村的孩子需不需要美育？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/vMCE1SIISojaA1pyEdXttSCFwmE6MrnjJsd4NQjL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/vMCE1SIISojaA1pyEdXttSCFwmE6MrnjJsd4NQjL.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;最初，桂南学校有40多个班，1700多名学生，3名美术老师，却没有一间美术教室。 2018年7月，桂南学校拿出一楼的六间教室改为美术教室。现在，这所学校已经有8名专职美术老师，拥有四个工作室和一间图书阅览室。教学内容涉及国画、版画、陶艺、剪纸等。桂南的校园还建有一间微型美术馆，里面摆放着学生们的作品。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;探访此地时，南方周末记者惊讶于藏在校园的美术作品。这些作品摆满了校园，大量泥塑作品晾晒在地上，版画作品贴在墙上，装置艺术挂在走廊里，手工作品贴在屋檐下。这些作品颇有童趣，数量最多的是泥塑，有杯盘碗盏、瓶瓶罐罐，也有各种造型奇特的泥塑小人。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;2023年8月，关勇等人开启了一项乡村教师计划，为那些来自乡村的一线教师提供教学上的支持，计划两年内完成培训一千个老师的计划。张耀仁说：“做千人计划，恰恰因为我们认为（美育）人是最重要的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“没干过木工就干木工，没玩过泥巴就玩泥巴”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;本地孩子多选择去开在镇上的公立学校，桂南学校招来的学生基本上为外来务工人员的子弟。这些学生大多来自四川、湖南、安徽等地。他们的父母背井离乡来到珠三角。学生在上课，父母便在附近街市卖东西，在工厂上班、打零工等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张耀仁向南方周末记者回忆，每个学期都会有学生离开。父辈们离开打工地，孩子们也像鸟儿一样飞走了。学习成绩与美术无关。张耀仁说，他们并没有向学生家长透露美术课程的想法。他理解家长的想法，美术无用，还不如多做几道题目：“家长肯定说，我儿子数学才85分，你能不能美术课的90分钟不让他上，他可能就考90分了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;关勇有个观点，关于课程，国家统编的美术教材始终是基础，占到课程的七成。剩下的三成，教学团队进行外延和扩展。一到九年级的18本教材内容被打散，与四个工作室重新建立联系。随着年级增长，每个工作室提供的内容日渐加深。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/yPaKd9OGAQgZTSxdq2wI90zCjjZziTskqh66IZUd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/yPaKd9OGAQgZTSxdq2wI90zCjjZziTskqh66IZUd.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;提高教师的审美和教学能力是关键。五年前，桂南学校仅有两位美术老师，学生们上课便是拿出A4纸勾画。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“（乡村美术老师）他们的专业度上是不深的，国美、央美毕业的老师怎么会来我们这边？在老师的专业水平没那么高的情况下，怎么可以提升他们的水平？”张耀仁对南方周末记者说，“干活，教你方法，你没干过木工就干木工，没玩过泥巴就玩泥巴。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;关勇等人更愿意把进课堂称之为进工作室，他们认为艺术是成人世界的词汇，而儿童基础美术教育是“启蒙学生的创意和自我表达”，更像是“一个艺术性的工作”。少谈美术理论，碰到问题，关勇总说“动起来”。没美术基础怎么办？关勇说，那就干活！干着干着，手上就有了感觉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/1EySt6Joa4v1Qfj3z416218QnPl4KnxPxxZ1Z1UV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/1EySt6Joa4v1Qfj3z416218QnPl4KnxPxxZ1Z1UV.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;桂南学校没有额外增加美术课的时间，当然也不允许抢占美术课的时间，学生一周要完成一次九十分钟的课程。四十分钟的美术课根本不足以让孩子们“尽兴”。课程的开端，总有一个欣赏环节。老师将课程相关的图拿来给孩子“看”。九年的时间，学生可以看上万张图，这些图片成为他们审美的来源之一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比如，二年级的课程《剪纸——变身记》，学生需要学习折纸、装订、剪、拼贴头部，观看黄永玉、小松美羽、韩美林等人的作品；五年级第一学期的九十分钟课，课题为《套色吹塑版画——瓶花》，授课内容包括刻轮廓线、刻花纹，观看的资料包括戴维茨、梵高、马蒂斯的作品等；九年级的课程《综合版画——面具》，学生要学习刻亮度和刻灰度，观看顾恺之、吴道子、张萱的作品。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;工作室里有各种设备，包括价值昂贵的版画机，还有各种绘画工具，胶枪、锯子等。据统计，纸张便有三十多种。这些材料来自桂南学校支出。张耀仁说，学校方面付出了很大的努力&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/Q4vVA4zYwX0QyIXfpOnDVbYEIDsoi3KyR1mlocmq.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;桂南学校的美术工作室，抽屉里放满了各种不同材质的纸张。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，并不是每个学校都有足够的材料经费。一些材料同样来自土地。美术老师带着学生们收集树叶、泥土、废弃纸张、旧衣服、塑料瓶等。每一个学期，桂南的孩子们会消耗掉成吨的泥土。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;美术老师干成了主科学科带头人&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;张耀仁曾走访过粤西的一些乡村学校，这些学校的留守儿童比例占到了六成以上。在某个镇的中心小学，仅有180个学生。 “撤点并校”的背景下，网易数读的数据显示，从1976年到2016年的四十年间，有91.6万所小学在中国消失，而其中消失的基本都是农村小学。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;多位参与培训的美术老师向南方周末记者印证了这个说法。一位湖南衡阳的乡村教师不无伤感对南方周末记者说，她所在的乡村小学，下学期将要合并了。她从外地匆匆赶来，心里带着莫大的期待，想为村里的孩子带来新的东西。工作四年，她看着学生从一百多个减少到三十多个。她有些羡慕体育课，校园足球教育是衡阳特色，几乎每个小学都配备足球场并保证体育课时。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;浙江致朴公益基金会的负责人骆筱红，人们称她为“花布”，多年来关注乡村儿童生命成长和困境儿童心理健康，她告诉南方周末记者，六年之前，在山区某县，全部乡村20所乡村小学，只有一个专职美术老师，这些年已经有了一些好转，但是仍然存在问题亟待解决。比如，在200个学生以下的学校有13个编制，“这显然（排课）怎么排都排不过来”，“巧妇难为无米之炊”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;乡村学校，“一个老师掰开好多个人来用”。 “我现在是负责带一年级的班主任，负责阅读课，劳技课，还要负责我们学校的品宣等。”一位老师向南方周末记者列举。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;走访乡村学校的时候，张耀仁发现：师范美术学校毕业的老师，有的十几年来在教主科，没有再教美术，而原本语文、数学等学科的老师，反而兼职教美术、音乐等课程。一些原本的美术老师甚至成了主科的学科带头人，聊起来“心底总有一些遗憾”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2020年，中共中央办公厅、国务院办公厅印发《关于全面加强和改进新时代学校美育工作的意见》。意见提出，要把美育纳入各级各类学校人才培养全过程，贯穿学校教育各学段。一位来自湘西的公立小学的80后老师，是当地第二批美术特长生。执教十三年，语数外教了个遍。近两年，学校响应美育政策，她得以重回本行转为专职美术老师，弥补当时遗憾：“美术不是没有门槛，是因为他们觉得教得不好没有关系，不会造成后果。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美术教育始终被认为是“副科”。在很多时候，副科的课时常被主科“侵占”，尤其是教育资源匮乏的小学，主科老师兼任副科老师的情况较为常见，侵占副科课时，更是“水到渠成”。 “国家层面发了许多关于美育的文件，不可谓不重视。美术老师喜欢上美术课，学生也爱上美术课，但是很多情况下却没有上成美术课。”骆筱红感到心痛。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;排课另有玄机，按照正常排课，比如一个语文老师十二节课，使用的是原本的语文课时；但在实际操作中，给语文老师排六节语文课，剩下六节换成美术、体育等课程，自然所有的“副科”都上成语文课。据骆筱红在浙江两个县的观察情况来看，这两年“两张课表”的情况有加剧的趋势。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位民办小学美术老师来自云南大理某县城，所教的村小有250个学生。她告诉南方周末记者，来到桂南学校，似乎一下子找到了同行者。比如，两者都选择两个课时组成一节大课。她所在的学校不会占用美术时间，但是在隔壁的公立小学，情况完全不一样，“现在都要考试，课时又不够，老师为了出成绩（只能这么做）”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“我二十年前画的东西，你们还在画”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者在授课现场看到，来培训的美术老师在工作室经历了桂南课堂的美育内容：了解材料-获取材料-制作-老师点评。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;乡村老师的水平显然不一。第一节实践课涉及手工制书，老师大多顺利完成了作品。而在第二节的水墨画课上，老师的水墨作品质量便呈现出一定的差异性。一些老师一边创作，一边对南方周末记者说，实际上，他们已经很多年没有真正碰水墨了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;按照关勇的要求，一位陕西安康的美术老师使用了三种不同的纸，感受水墨。他不由念起课堂上的学生们，每人发一支毛笔，每人倒一点点墨，让他们在纸箱子上、A4纸上来涂抹，这是他能带学生感受水墨的最大努力了。如果是手工课，也许剪纸最为简单和方便。多位老师告诉南方周末记者，目前主要的授课形式就是图画课。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;乡村资源困顿的现实仍然存在。一位湖南怀化的美术老师说，学校的资源匮乏，一些美术课的材料甚至需要自己掏腰包去购买，前后花了差不多两万块，“实在是干不了，教室是空的，什么也没有，画板也没有，怎么教？”张耀仁说，他接触到的学校，学生需要自备材料，如果家庭无法提供，那课程很难进行下去。 “材料之痛，是美术课程的一个无处遁形的伤疤”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/Hj47ESMSaP91n0rp7AvckUqLyRfBjsQmFyoeVrM1.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;上述来自云南的乡村老师表示，一些教学内容涉及高楼大厦、斑马线等，有的乡村孩子从没出过村子，只在电视中见过。 “既然高楼大厦画的是线条和方块，我们就转化内容，考虑怎么回到教学目标”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/aq5KSZquk7pNJuHuzUjJUZccQX7cQXqiurpR8NNH.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;培训计划并不拒绝城市的美术老师，也许他们的学校资源优渥，但在教学方法上仍有困惑。一位来自北京海淀区的年轻老师提问，课本内容有些统一的要求创新，例如，让学生去在三角形中涂色，教师所做的有限。关勇反问道，你为什么不把三角形做大呢？为什么不设计一个巨型三角形，让学生自由涂色？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这位90后老师恍然。他出身于师范类美术教育专业，如今在海淀某重点小学授课，负责四年级到六年级的课程。据他说，无论是课时、资源都充沛，也无乡村教师的兼任困扰。学校的美术老师均受过非常好的专业美术训练。 “美术老师的压力来自于&#39;听课评课&#39;的常态化。”上述年轻老师说，另一个困扰是一周两节课往往间隔几天，加上教材的内容琐碎，学生的学习不够系统。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;看过作品后，他评价“这边的孩子（比北京的孩子）做得更活一些”。与许多乡村老师初见校园的惊喜不同，他感受更多的不是美术本身，而是美术之外的东西。现场，一位老师提问，是否应该为孩子进行示范，这是过往多年来的教学模式之一。关勇制止了她。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;广州天河区城中村的一位美术老师告诉南方周末记者，自己是美术专业出身，从来都是按照标准绘画，学习绘画的公式，画画的时候考虑最多的是公式，而非表达情感。她指着墙上学生的作品说，“第一感觉是非常自由，独一无二”。她想起自己的孩子在区前十的中学上学，参与学校的兴趣班，结果学习的内容和模式和自己小时候毫无差别，“我二十年前画的东西，你们还在画”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;美术是一把盐&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;桂南没有内部的评比活动，也很少参加外围的美术比赛。张耀仁解释说，美术作品的核心是自我表达，表达内心的感受，这怎么能够评分呢？而且观察那些比赛中的作品，往往能看到老师干预的痕迹。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;几年前，张耀仁要设计一个标识。在民间工作室，他看到一张猴子式样的版画。这张版画后来成为标识。按照收藏的标准，关勇特地制作了漂亮的收藏证书，上面有作者名字和作品名，在升国旗仪式时颁发证书给孩子，并给予奖金。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/I1BvI5zZPXHpe53okfU9YdjzV0MHq6UiQ4mf1FVA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/I1BvI5zZPXHpe53okfU9YdjzV0MHq6UiQ4mf1FVA.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;桂南学校举办乡村儿童艺术双年展时，美国宾夕法尼亚大学的一位学生，研究建立了一个数据模型，分析艺术教育对外来务工子女的影响。第一轮的效果分析出来后，得到一个正向性的结论。张耀仁不太愿意将结果功利化和数据化，用以论证美术和学习成绩之间的关系。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他常说，美术就是一把盐，生活需要一点调味品。至于美育的势能和影响，张耀仁不考虑这些，也不在意。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美术始终要落在教育，而非作品上。学校老师有学生作品观察,老师观察和记录学生课堂的行为、习惯、情绪等。比如一本《期末总结美术课堂观察日记》上，写于2020-2021学年第二学期的观察日记，每一位学生都以课堂表现、常规习惯、作品呈现来记录，一位学生表现不佳，一位老师如此写道：“往后课堂里，我会努力找到合适这类孩子的创作方式。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;至少在一部分外界观点看来，挤占美术课，增加学习时间，提升升学率才是改变务工子女命运的关键。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;桂南学校校长石磊从2017年便在想一个问题，究竟哪些人离我们最近？ “厨师、服务员、修理工、清洁工等，我们真实的生活中，感受源于他们。”石磊说，“我们的学生会有概率成为他们，这是很现实的问题。”据统计，学校仅有35%的学生会升入高中，而剩下的学生则会进入中专、职校等，如果他们对生活有不一样的感受呢？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;石磊告诉南方周末记者，五年多的时间，学校陆续投了几百万元，改了教室、建了美术馆、买了材料等，减少了学校的招生规模，从2000多学生减少到了1200名左右，加上学费偏低，学校几乎每年都亏损。有同行跑来学校指着他骂，脑子有问题就去看病，“（他们不理解）这件事能帮我涨学费，还是帮我多招生？”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“复制”桂南式的美术教育存在难度。关勇在珠海接触过一些学校，几乎到了最后环节，却因老师反对而作罢。关勇回忆说，老师们不愿意干，认为增加了工作量却没带来额外的收入，自己主动要教，老师也不同意。 “太习以为常了，”关勇说，“不干就走了。”&amp;nbsp;骆筱红告诉南方周末记者，他们曾给一些乡村学校捐赠画笔、颜料等，结果几年过去，东西仍然囤在那里。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“如果你们了解我们的学生，你们只会做得更多。”石磊说，外来务工子弟的生活奔波、飘摇，在生活的压力下缺少机会去舒缓情绪。如果在很紧凑的生活中，多一个出口，生活会不会好一些？九年的时间，上万张作品看下来，生活的审美会不会提高一些？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;石磊成长在工厂的子弟校，从小接触了很多好的美术老师、音乐老师，数年过去，语数外的知识忘却，却记得过去的美术课和音乐课，生活也得益于当时充盈的馈赠。 “别人看我们做了很多作品，画了很多画，这些在我们心里面反而是最不重要的，”石磊说，“我们不是为了这个东西去做这件事情，真正重要的是美育的过程。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 19:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[癌症晚期旅客登机被拒：航空公司宁担非议背后的考量是什么？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256858]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a civil aviation news incident has attracted attention. On September 12, 2023, a passenger with terminal cancer booked a Chengdu Airlines ticket at Chengdu Tianfu International Airport but was refused boarding, which attracted public attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As can be seen in the video, an old man is sitting in a wheelchair, while another man and the old lady are sitting on the ground and calling airline customer service. The man cried and said, &quot;Nothing is allowed to let me leave. I signed the commitment myself and brought a caregiver with me. Why don&#39;t you let me leave?&quot; Then the man added, &quot;I have cancer. Four months. You said before that if you don&#39;t have heart disease, respiratory disease, or trauma, it&#39;s fine.&quot; The family finally knelt on the ground and begged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Afterwards, Chengdu Airlines staff responded that the passenger was indeed a terminal cancer patient, and the company has clear regulations not to carry such patients to prevent passengers from becoming unwell during the flight. This regulation is publicized in the &quot;General Conditions of Transport&quot; on the official website. If you are a cancer patient in the early or middle stages, there is no absolute restriction on passengers taking the flight. Netizens&#39; opinions are also polarized. Some netizens said that the airline is impersonal and has &quot;overlord clauses&quot; that &quot;discriminate against passengers.&quot; However, some netizens expressed understanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This incident has come to an end, but there are still some issues worthy of analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Firstly, airlines deny boarding to passengers with terminal cancer for safety reasons. Article 6.1.3 of the &quot;General Conditions of Carriage&quot; on the official website of Chengdu Airlines states, &quot;Passengers with the following diseases will not be transported unless special arrangements are made with Chengdu Airlines&#39; consent.&quot; Paragraph 10 of this article refers to &quot;patients with terminal cancer.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, not only Chengdu Airlines is &quot;not allowed to carry&quot;, but all major domestic airlines also have similar or similar regulations. For example, Air China lists in the general conditions of transportation, &quot;Large vertical septum&quot; &quot;Patients with tumors, extremely large hernias and intestinal obstructions&quot; will not be provided with air transportation services unless agreed or with special arrangements; China Eastern Airlines also states in the &quot;Service Instructions for Sick Passengers&quot; that for &quot;patients with large mediastinal tumors, extremely large hernias&quot; and patients with intestinal obstruction&quot;, it is recommended not to choose to fly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that Chengdu Airlines is not the only airline that &quot;targets&quot; sick passengers. To be more precise, similar regulations of airlines fall into the category of &quot;rejection of transportation and restriction of transportation&quot;. Although the specific regulations of major airlines are different, the principle behind them is the same: airlines cannot guarantee that they can effectively protect and ensure the safety of passengers during the transportation process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Revere regulations, revere life&quot; is by no means an empty phrase in the field of civil aviation. Behind every seemingly strange regulation, there are safety accidents, large and small, and bloody lives as a reminder. For passengers with advanced cancer or special diseases, changes in air pressure and oxygen concentration will pose a great threat to life, and there is a potential risk of sudden illness requiring rescue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, not only passengers with special diseases are not suitable for boarding, but also pregnant women who are 32 weeks or more than 36 weeks pregnant are not suitable for boarding. They require medical permission and diagnosis certificate to board with restrictions. This takes into account the potential health risks of pregnant women during flights. By extension, people suffering from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are not suitable for riding roller coasters, and the elderly, weak, sick and young are not suitable for participating in extreme sports such as diving and mountain climbing. This is not a &quot;denial of service&quot; or &quot;discrimination against consumers&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Therefore, the passengers in this incident are more suitable to travel by high-speed rail or car. This can avoid the health risks caused by changes in air pressure and oxygen concentration during flight, and it is easier to get timely information during the trip. medical services. After all, it is much easier to get off the high-speed train or car to see a doctor than to find a doctor while flying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, airlines deny boarding to passengers with terminal cancer, which itself reflects the relationship of equal rights and responsibilities between airlines and passengers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this incident, the &quot;letter of commitment&quot; proposed by the parties concerned attracted more attention. Some netizens believed that since the passengers had &quot;signed and promised to bear all the consequences themselves,&quot; it would be inappropriate for the airline to still refuse to board the plane. Although this statement seems reasonable, it ignores the current laws and the actual situation of civil aviation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of civil relations, airlines are just commercial institutions that provide transportation services. Their contractual obligation is to safely transport passengers to their destinations by aircraft; passengers purchase transportation services that meet the face value and do not Healthcare that goes beyond face value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If passengers with terminal cancer are allowed to board the plane, the airline may not be able to bear the corresponding risks, and the potential costs required will be far greater than the revenue from this single ticket business, including but not limited to passenger accidents Death, flight turning back after a passenger becomes ill, etc. I would like to ask, once the plane is forced to make a temporary diversion or turn back, who will compensate other passengers for the resulting loss of rights and interests? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Civil aviation aircraft are not special-purpose &quot;medical aircraft&quot; and do not have the conditions for &quot;airborne ICU&quot;. Once a sick passenger encounters an emergency and requires medical treatment during the flight, it may be an additional task that the airline is unable to handle and has no obligation to handle. Whether a passenger dies or the plane is forced to turn back in an emergency, the total losses suffered by all parties will undoubtedly be much greater. A &quot;letter of commitment to bear the consequences&quot; that may not be legally binding cannot persuade airlines to ignore possible risks and bear huge potential costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Therefore, the airline&#39;s refusal to board passengers with terminal cancer is not so much &quot;discrimination&quot; with a more positive or negative meaning, but rather &quot;differential treatment&quot; based on specific circumstances. This &quot;differential treatment&quot; not only shows respect for the safety of passengers&#39; lives and property, but also demonstrates the principle of &quot;equivalence of rights and responsibilities&quot;. Airlines and passengers are both civil subjects, and their rights and obligations are completely equal. Airlines have the right to refuse service to passengers who exceed their obligations and capabilities. Passengers can also choose other aviation service providers who are willing to take greater risks, or other means of transportation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一块钱酸梅汤打败“入秋第一杯奶茶”，网红中药能刷医保吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256723]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[旧房换新房，能否激活淄博楼市？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256841]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/09/15/97064ca1ac.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2048&quot; height=&quot;1366&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/ 15/97064ca1ac.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250933&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;April 10, 2023, Qisheng Lake Park, Zibo, Shandong . (Visual China/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;These days, some staff from local government departments always call Li Bin to ask him about the &quot;trade-in&quot; method of buying a house in Zibo. mode and specific operating procedures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 6, 2023, the Zibo Real Estate Development Association and the Municipal Real Estate Brokerage and Appraisal Association jointly launched a signing ceremony for the &quot;old-for-new&quot; home purchase, with the first batch of 12 companies Representatives of real estate development companies and real estate brokerage agencies signed cooperation agreements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to &quot;Zibo Daily&quot;, &quot;old for new&quot; means exchanging old houses for new ones. Real estate development companies and real estate brokerage agencies join forces to speed up the sales of existing housing. Real estate companies give priority to providing high-quality housing to meet the replacement needs of home buyers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, there is still a lot of speculation in the market about the specific method of &quot;trade-in&quot;. On the short video platform, some people interpreted that Zibo’s “old-for-new” policy for home purchases this time allows the appraisal agency to “give the money after the old house has been appraised to the home buyer, and the home buyer will then use the money to buy a new home.”&lt;/p >; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Trading old for new&quot; was the earliest housing sales model tried by Beike. On September 13, as the deputy general manager of Shell (Shandong) Internet Co., Ltd., Li Bin clarified to Southern Weekend reporters: When the original customer replaced, if the second-hand house he lived in before could not be sold, he would not have the funds on hand to buy a new house. Deposit. The current &quot;old-for-new&quot; model requires developers, intermediaries and customers to sign an agreement. According to the agreement, after the customer pays the deposit, the developer will give the customer 90-180 days to sell the house and reserve the customer&#39;s favorite house; The intermediary also promotes customers’ second-hand houses on the platform. If the customer&#39;s house is still not sold after the agreement period, the deposit will be refunded. &quot;The core of &#39;trade-in&#39; old for new&#39; is to shorten the replacement cycle between new and second-hand houses.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image /23/09/15/56104f158b.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2048&quot; height=&quot;1434&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15 /56104f158b.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250934&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Local Government Concerned about the decommissioning of new houses&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Shandong, Jinan City was the first to launch the &quot;old-for-new&quot; policy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In July 2023, the Shandong Real Estate Association and the Jinan Real Estate Association held a seminar on the &quot;Real Estate Market Situation in the First Half of the Year&quot;. In addition to the member units of the Shandong Real Estate Association and the Jinan Real Estate Association, the meeting was also attended by the Shandong Provincial Department of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, the Finance and Economics Office of the Provincial Party Committee, the Jinan Municipal Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau and some financial institutions. Li Bin remembers that that meeting was the starting point for the debut of &quot;old for new&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;It was recognized by some developers in Jinan at that time.&quot; Li Bin said that in late August, &quot;old for new&quot; began to be piloted in some projects in Jinan. Taking a project of a real estate company as an example, Beike provides home buyers with second-hand house evaluation, listing, inspection and transaction services. For second-hand houses that meet transaction standards, Beike will help customers sell their houses quickly within 30-90 days; the project team Provide 1%-2% home purchase subsidies to buyers of second-hand houses to speed up the sales of second-hand houses. Among them, buyers of first-hand houses can lock in the house they want by paying 100,000 yuan, and then pay for the new house after the second-hand house is sold. If the second-hand house is not sold, they can enjoy check-out guarantee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bin remembered that at a real estate brokerage seminar held in Zibo in August, staff from the relevant administrative departments in Zibo also expressed their opinions on this &quot;old-for-new&quot; housing buying and selling model. I was very interested and suggested that Zibo&#39;s industry associations could also try to promote it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The core method is to shorten the transaction time between new homes and second homes, and the government plays a supporting and encouraging role in this.&quot; Li Bin introduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhuge housing search data shows that from January to July 2023, the price of new houses in Zibo continued to climb, rising from 8,272 yuan/square meter to 8,425 yuan/square meter. But the price dropped to 8,389 yuan/square meter in August. In contrast, Zibo&#39;s second-hand housing prices have been rising month after month, and since November 2022, there has been an inversion of primary and second-hand housing prices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bin explained to Southern Weekend reporters that &quot;replacing old houses with new ones&quot; requires accelerating the disposal of second-hand houses and at the same time making a good connection with the replacement of new houses. If the second-hand house in the hands of the home buyer cannot be sold, he will not have the down payment for the new house, and he will not be able to make the decision to buy a new house. &quot;Data shows that the average transaction cycle for second-hand houses in Jinan City is now 175 days, and even more than 250 days in Zibo.&quot; In smaller cities and counties, the transaction cycle for second-hand houses will be longer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bin introduced that the &quot;old-for-new&quot; policy for buying houses will be implemented in many cities in Shandong such as Tai&#39;an and Jining. In addition to Shandong, some cities outside the province also want to learn about relevant experiences. Li Bin found that the local governments who came to communicate would be more concerned about the sale of new houses. “After all, the sale of new houses is the most important means for cities to activate the real estate market.” &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;There are more people waiting and watching&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;September 8, &quot;Zibo Daily&quot; More than 40 first-hand properties with &quot;old-for-new&quot; agreements were announced. However, several local real estate agents in Zibo told Southern Weekend reporters that more people who want to buy a house are still waiting and watching. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Yuan (pseudonym), a real estate agent in Zibo City, told Southern Weekend reporters that after the introduction of the &quot;old for new&quot; policy, the number of people viewing houses has increased significantly, more than before. One-third, his daily working hours also increased from the original 12 hours to 14 hours. He said that if the agent fails to sell the old house within the three months stipulated in the agreement, the client will take back the old house and the deposit, which is &quot;equivalent to three months of work in vain.&quot; Zhang Yuan explained that the policy will bring greater workload to the intermediary, but if the client is sure to sell the old house, he will have more confidence to buy a new house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another Zibo real estate agent, Sun Yu (pseudonym), updated his policy interpretation on the short video platform on September 8. In addition, he receives twenty or thirty related consultation calls every day. There are people who are in a hurry to sell their old house and buy a new one and ask more than a dozen questions at once, while there are also people who inquire casually and take a wait-and-see attitude. Sun Yu told Southern Weekend reporters that developers of large real estate projects generally do not accept old houses. “If he (the developer) wants to sell new houses, why would he buy second-hand houses?” As for intermediaries, they are generally willing to represent large-property houses. , that is, houses where the owner owns the house and can produce a real estate certificate, &quot;the sales difficulty is low and the transaction rate is higher.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sun Yu said that the second-hand houses for sale in his hands are mainly located in Zhangdian West District, the main urban area of ​​Zibo, which is also what the intermediary calls Zibo&#39;s &quot;prime location.&quot; The highest price here exceeds 20,000 yuan per square meter, while in the suburbs with the lowest prices, one square meter sells for only 5,000 to 6,000 yuan, which is a quarter of the price in the central city. &quot;The first-hand properties participating in the &#39;trade-in&#39; program are not very easy to sell,&quot; Sun Yu said. Most of them are located in the suburbs of Zibo with relatively poor locations, and the number of houses in the school district is relatively small. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But there are already customers who have successfully &quot;traded in old products for new ones&quot; with Sun Yu. This is a 35-year-old customer. He needs to sell his old house in the eastern part of Zhangdian District before he can have enough budget to buy a house in a school district. Previously, this old house had been listed on the trading platform for nearly half a year without any interest. In the past few days, Sun Yu sold the client&#39;s old house for 800,000 yuan, and the client spent more than 1.5 million yuan to buy a school district house in the southwest area of ​​Zhangdian. In Sun Yu&#39;s opinion, this is one of the best-located houses in the first-hand real estate that participates in the &quot;old-for-new&quot; project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sun Yu currently opens his own real estate agency in Zibo, with more than a dozen employees, and his business focuses on the sale of first-hand and second-hand houses. He said that the current policy has not brought significant changes in sales volume to the company. In 2023, the company&#39;s monthly housing sales will mainly focus on 3 to 5 units. The New Deal has led to more people consulting, &quot;but everyone is very cautious, and there are more people waiting and watching.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 16:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[当“知心闺蜜”恶语相向之前：李佳琦这样的“赛博货郎”何以逆势成功？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256854]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, &quot;the most powerful beauty blogger&quot; Li Jiaqi angrily criticized consumers in the live broadcast room. Li Jiaqi himself has been caught in the whirlpool of public opinion. Even after he apologized in tears, the criticism and accusations against him have not subsided. In addition to pushing him to the forefront of public opinion, this storm has also focused the public&#39;s attention on In the industry of &quot;carrying anchor&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before getting involved in this verbal controversy, Li Jiaqi had built an astonishing business empire through years of hard work in the field of beauty live streaming. The total sales of his short video platform live broadcast room in one month exceeded &quot;Shocking records&quot; such as 1 billion yuan and 15,000 lipsticks sold in 5 minutes have even triggered communication scholars to study its sales discourse system and communication strategies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the main consumer portraits, Li Jiaqi mainly targets female audiences, which can be seen from his iconic opening remarks &quot;all girls&quot; during his live broadcast. In addition to the skilled symbolic use of &quot;girlfriend accents&quot; such as &quot;Your devil is here&quot;, &quot;Oh my god&quot;, &quot;It&#39;s so pretty&quot;, &quot;Buy it, buy it&quot;, Li Jiaqi is also very good at using hierarchical contrast communication strategies. Through &quot;lifting and stepping on&quot;, we create a &quot;superior&quot; consumption satisfaction for consumers. For example, when describing the lipstick brand as &quot;rustic&quot;, Li Jiaqi would use rhetorical methods such as &quot;the color my mother painted twenty years ago&quot; to awaken consumers&#39; memories. When recommending their own products, they will use rhetorical means such as &quot;You are the peach in the world&quot;, &quot;You will be a lady if you paint it&quot;, &quot;Limited edition of XX color&quot;, etc. to provide female consumers with room for imagination and inspire them. Consumer impulse to place a single trial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consumers, mainly female, are willing to spend money in Li Jiaqi’s live broadcast room not only because of their recognition and affirmation of the professional ability of his “lipstick brother”, but also because of his “close friend” trust and favor. Similarly, what female consumers buy in Li Jiaqi’s live broadcast room is not only lipstick and eyebrow pencil, but also emotional value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So the cause and result of the &quot;censorship incident&quot; are actually very simple. For anchors, under the pressure of the stock game and the economic downturn, even Li Jiaqi, who is precise and proficient in the &quot;girlfriend accent&quot; and &quot;the best understanding of women&#39;s hearts&quot;, has perfect head anchors to mobilize consumers&#39; consumption impulses. Times are not as easy as before, and the resulting fatigue and irritability are themselves a natural reflection of the economic and social environment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For consumers, it is emotionally difficult for consumers to have their “best friends” who have flattered and flattered them in the past and provided full emotional value regardless of whether they consume or not, suddenly lower their faces and say nasty things to them. Accepted. Although Li Jiaqi often calls and describes consumers as &quot;princess&quot;, &quot;lady&quot; and &quot;queen&quot;, in fact, his main consumer groups are still mainly working-class people. They are commonly known as &quot;workers&quot; and are involved in the pressure of the workplace. When I was exhausted and tried to find emotional value in the live broadcast room of my &quot;best friend&quot;, I was accused of &quot;not trying hard&quot; by the other party. It is also a normal emotional reaction to get angry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that the &quot;censorship incident&quot; was actually an instant hedging of the common emotions between Li Jiaqi and consumers under pressure. But Li Jiaqi and consumers are not the only ones under pressure. At a time when &quot;it&#39;s not easy for everyone to make money,&quot; the way for &quot;Li Jiaqi&quot; to make money seems too easy, so the &quot;censorship incident&quot; has become an outlet for that pressure. While the public used this incident to vent their stress and emotions, they also began to think about how &quot;goods anchors&quot; became an &quot;easy to make money&quot; industry in our society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Li Jiaqi’s role in the entire beauty industry chain is more similar to that of a salesman selling needles, threads, and cosmetics boxes in pre-modern society. He is neither a producer of goods nor a businessman who opens a store to do business in the traditional sense, but a more special kind of sales terminal. In the old society, due to the restrictions of etiquette, women could neither move around nor obtain information about goods. These housewives, who had limited information and limited knowledge, needed the medium of a salesman to understand and purchase goods. Therefore, in ancient society, a successful salesman must be a person who is familiar with women&#39;s psychological characteristics, masters certain speaking skills, and can speak into women&#39;s hearts. A ballad from the old society goes like this:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Salesman Son, selling flower thread, carrying a load on the street. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jingle bell shakes to call the girl, and leads her to meet her at the door. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The girl should smile and be angry again, and the price should be cheap and the goods should be new. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, the salesman is blessed with beauty and often has sex with beauties in his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that modern &quot;beauty anchors&quot; are in the same vein as the ancient salesmen selling needle threads and cosmetics boxes in terms of understanding the psychological characteristics of consumers, formulating targeted marketing strategies, and matching the emotional value of sales. It is precisely because of this characteristic that there was widespread prejudice and discrimination against the profession of peddlers in the old society. It was believed that they behaved improperly and would seduce women whenever they had the opportunity. In Ming and Qing dynasty novels, there were many peddlers who seduced, abducted and trafficked women. The story of a good woman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of business development form theory, peddlers in the old society were the product of poor business information in a closed and semi-closed &quot;acquaintance society&quot; environment. In the information age, there are various sales channels and sales methods, open product information is readily available, and various product advertisements are overwhelming. In this environment, there should be no living space for &quot;cyber peddlers&quot;, at least other It should not occupy such an important position and proportion in modern business activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But reality is exactly the opposite of theory. The &quot;cyber gangsters&quot; represented by Li Jiaqi have not only bucked the trend and achieved great success in the modern information society, but also work part-time with &quot;Internet celebrities&quot; in some other countries. The business model of carrying goods is different. In my country, &quot;cyber hawkers&quot; have developed into a specialized profession and formed a large professional group, becoming the most important and powerful sales channel and method of online e-commerce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the world&#39;s largest manufacturing country, the world&#39;s largest informatization country, and the world&#39;s largest online retail country, consumers&#39; consumption habits have returned to a certain extent to the &quot;hawker model&quot; of pre-modern society. , there are actually very profound reasons behind this counter-intuitive, counter-logical, and counter-intuitive reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, it is precisely because of the huge abundance of products, the explosive growth of product information, and the seamless coverage of product advertisements that consumers in the ocean of products and information feel confused and confused. . At the same time, the cost of &quot;trial and error&quot; has also increased exponentially, and consumers who are unwilling to delve into relevant knowledge and compare the pros and cons of similar products in order to buy a product will naturally return to &quot;acquaintances&quot; in another sense. Society&quot;, that is, choosing to trust the &quot;enthusiastic recommendations&quot; of the &quot;cyber peddlers&quot; you like. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the information society certainly has its noisy and bustling side, but behind the information explosion, surging public opinion, and all-weather socialization, the spiritual loneliness of atomized individuals on the Internet is also a serious problem. As mentioned earlier, what Li Jiaqi, the &quot;cyber salesman&quot; provides, is not just lipstick and eyebrow pencil, but also emotional value. Perhaps, the latter is more important than the former in determining the role of the ancient profession of &quot;cyber salesman&quot; in this modern information age. A broad and permanent living space in the commercial society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（本文仅为作者个人观点，不代表本报立场）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
