The tree-lined mountains, the wooden houses towering over the villages, and the sparkling mountain lakes make you forget to leave. However, the town, which receives up to 10,000 visitors a day, is tiring for many of its approximately 800 residents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/e8d6f4c91c.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;737&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/e8d6f4c91c.JPG&quot; data-key=&quot;258861&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;International internet celebrity tourist cities are overcrowded, and many places have enacted rules to restrict tourists. (Li Chunhua/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the recovery of global tourism, the term &quot;overtourism&quot; has reappeared. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 8, 2023, at the World Travel Mart, the organizer and Oxford Economics jointly released a new 2023 global leisure tourism report, and pointed out that in 2023, global leisure tourism The total number of tourists only dropped by about 10% compared with 2019 before the epidemic, and the total number of leisure tourists accounted for 60% of the total number of tourists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Concerns about overtourism appear not only in popular cities such as Austria, Venice, and Bali, but also in other regions such as Hawaii and Greece, Spain, and Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/f6d22842ac.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;678&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/f6d22842ac.JPG&quot; data-key=&quot;258862&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Dozens of tourists are pouring into Europe&#39;s otherwise peaceful country The small town troubles many locals. (Yao Jiatong/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Local residents are often dissatisfied that the influx of tourists has pushed up local consumption levels and put huge pressure on local infrastructure and urban management. In addition, the uncivilized behavior of some foreign tourists interferes with their daily lives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, many international celebrity tourist cities have formulated rules to restrict tourists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, Venice charges a &quot;city entry tax&quot; for day-trippers; the ancient city of Croatia uses cameras to monitor the flow of people and closes its doors as soon as the number of people exceeds 6,000; Iceland restricts local residents from renting out properties for tourists to live in; Machu Picchu only Three fixed tour routes have been opened to foreign tourists...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The United Nations World Tourism Organization stated that from the release of the new crown epidemic to 2030, the number of international tourists is expected to increase by 50 million every year, and the growth will mainly come from Asia. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;“Enough of the huge, noisy tourist groups”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;365 days a year, photographer Chen Chen Half the time is spent traveling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he arrived in Austria, the &quot;artistic atmosphere&quot; hit him, which doubled his fondness for the city. When walking on the street, Chen Chen said he couldn&#39;t help but stop at what was playing on the big screen of the opera house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, the small town of Hallstatt is a veritable &quot;Internet celebrity check-in place&quot;, located in the Salzkammergut region of Austria. In the past decade, its popularity has skyrocketed due to its use in movies and TV series. At the same time, it is also a world cultural heritage with picturesque scenery, ancient salt mines, ancient tombs and other attractions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/e25879925a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/e25879925a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258863&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The Austrian town of Hallstatt is a World Cultural Heritage , picturesque scenery, and also has ancient salt mines, ancient tombs and other attractions. (Chen Chen/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But when he actually came to the small town of Hallstatt, Chen Chen’s feelings became different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There are so many foreign tourists in that town.&quot; Chen Chen&#39;s tone unconsciously increased. &quot;Obviously the locals don&#39;t like so many tourists.&quot; He observed that on the doors of many houses in the town, there would be signs such as &quot;Please do not speak loudly&quot; written on them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many reports claim that in just a few years, this village with nearly 800 residents has become a world tourist attraction. It receives around 1 million tourists a year, many of them Asians, &quot;who turn Hallstatt into an important stopover&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Chen remembered that one time, when he was taking pictures of a house, a local suddenly rushed out the door angrily and shouted at Chen Chen, telling him to go away quickly, otherwise he would call the police. &quot;Locals have had enough of large, noisy, disruptive tour groups.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 27, 2023, residents took to the streets and blocked tunnels and main roads leading to the entrance to the town. Trying to draw attention to the problem of overtourism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The roads in the Austrian town are very narrow and crowded with people. Even the restaurants where you eat have long queues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Chen felt that not only was the restaurant’s service speed slow, but its attitude towards tourists was not very good either. &quot;Indifferent&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the mountain behind the small town of Hallstatt, there is a historic salt mine. Many foreign tourists come to this internet celebrity check-in place. But to take a small train up the mountain, Chen Chen couldn&#39;t wait in line, &quot;because there were too many people.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not easy to take pictures in the mountains. &quot;We take advantage of every crack, and the queue order is not particularly good.&quot; Chen Chen said that as a photographer, if there are too many passers-by in the shot, he can only change the perspective or rely on post-production to process the pictures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Too many tourists have also brought about some derivative problems, such as garbage visible everywhere.” Chen Chen believes that the uncivilized behavior of many foreign tourists will arouse the resentment of local people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After staying in the Austrian town for half a day, Chen Chen went to another town next door and found that the contrast was obvious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It was a very unknown town. It was very quiet, with few tourists. There was only one restaurant in the town.&quot; Chen Chen said that when I went there, the restaurant was full of locals dining. The elderly couple patted the empty seat next to them, indicating that Chen Chen could sit down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Chen found that the local people&#39;s lives were very leisurely. They got up late in the morning and everyone had a relaxed expression. The elderly couple said that they don&#39;t like too many tourists because they are too noisy, so they have been living in this quiet town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the Austrian town, a travel blogger also uploaded some street graffiti in Barcelona, ​​Spain on his social media account. The alleys in the neighborhood were almost covered with the words &quot;Tourists go back to their own homes&quot; The slogan was accompanied by the text &quot;In August, the European tourist season, Barcelona is so crowded that you can&#39;t even walk in the alleys.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such posts quickly aroused a lot of discussion. Lining, a netizen from Spain, explained in the comment area that the slogans sprayed by people in Barcelona are mainly aimed at tourists from Northern Europe. &quot;They party wildly, drink heavily, and urinate everywhere. The streets are always dirty.&quot; Lining said that local Barcelona people had to move out because of this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Media reports said that in protest, residents of the village of Hallstatt also erected a wooden barrier in the town, blocking the view of the Alps. However, the barrier was later removed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, the mayor of Hallstatt had promised to reduce the number of tourist buses entering the town, but the problem of overtourism persists. Residents are demanding a limit on the number of visitors per day and a curfew on tour buses, which are also not allowed into the city after 5 p.m. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On online social media platforms, many netizens express their understanding of the anti-tourist behavior of international Internet celebrities. They believe that excessive tourists have indeed squeezed the living space of local residents and affected their living environment. It has also increased prices around the scenic area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This is a very normal reaction.” Zhou Zhao, head of the European Department of Shenzhen Vanzhong Cultural Tourism, said that international tourism is a “love-hate relationship” for local residents. Love is that tourists can drive the local economy, but hate is that too many tourists will affect the lives of local people. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Ultimately make more money from tourists&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Fuzi is a freelance photographer, 2023 I started living in Bali in early September of this year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bali is more than a thousand kilometers away from Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, and is separated from Java Island by only a 3.2-kilometer-wide strait. It covers an area of ​​about more than 5,000 square kilometers. It is the most famous tourist and leisure area in Indonesia. Many travel magazines have voted it &quot;one of the most enchanting holiday destinations in the world&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The prices of accommodation and food in Bali have increased now,” Fuzi said. In the past, you could rent a large suite with a swimming pool for 2,000 to 3,000 yuan per month in Bali, with good decoration and beautiful scenery. . But after the epidemic is relaxed, you can only rent a single room at a similar price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even most restaurants have increased their prices. In the past, for 100 RMB per person, you could have a good Western meal in a restaurant with a nice environment, but now it costs at least 150 RMB. The starting price of a motorcycle has more than doubled from three to four yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhou Zhao told Southern Weekend reporters that for popular foreign tourist cities, it is generally necessary to book hotels about two months in advance, and prices have increased by about 30% on average compared to before the epidemic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Bali Province’s tourism statistics, from November 2022 to January 2023, Bali Province welcomed nearly 1 million foreign tourists. According to data released by the Chinese Consulate General in Denpasar, Indonesia, Bali Province receives about 40% of foreign tourists visiting Indonesia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the nature of her work, Fuzi often has to go out for filming. He bought a motorcycle, but there are often traffic jams on the road in Canggu, sometimes even for thirty or forty minutes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The road is very narrow, with a car in the middle and motorcycles jammed on both sides.” Fuzi told Southern Weekend reporters that tourists and locals overlapped, and some traffic jams also caused dust, causing the air to be dirty. good. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/6ff705530e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/6ff705530e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258864&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A short and narrow road, sometimes even It will take thirty or forty minutes. (Fuzi/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the car rental fees for foreign tourists in Bali have also increased. In the past, you could rent a motorcycle for 300 yuan, but now it costs 500 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhou Zhao said that this year, as the energy supply of most countries has been affected by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, prices such as fuel, gas, and electricity are rising, and travel costs have increased. Therefore, some outbound tour group fees It is more expensive due to this reason. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, for Fuzi, the longer he stays in Bali, the more his favorability decreases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The gap between the rich and the poor in Bali is large, and some people who rely on tourism have inspired others&#39; desire for money. After the epidemic was relaxed, many people who had houses at home opened B&amp;Bs or shops. In the past, Fuzi felt that most people in Bali were &quot;simple&quot;, but now they are more &quot;commercial&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May of this year, a piece of news about “you need to make a reservation one year in advance if you want to travel to Bali” attracted the attention of the international community. The source is a report from an Indonesian news website that the tourist resort island of Bali plans to impose restrictions on foreign tourists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, Bali Governor Wayan explained to the media that the restrictive measures were implemented mainly to prevent some foreign tourists from staying in the local area on tourist visas and illegally doing business or looking for jobs after running out of money on vacation. In addition, with the recovery of tourism after the epidemic and the arrival of large-scale tourists, some illegal and disrespectful behaviors have also appeared, &quot;causing Bali residents to feel uneasy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this plan, Fuzi thinks it is &quot;difficult to implement.&quot; Because in Bali, &quot;money is king.&quot; He said that both the government and the people of Bali want to develop the economy. The so-called &quot;application restrictions&quot; are only a minor problem as long as the money is available. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fuzi said that even if it is implemented, prices will not fall back to normal levels. &quot;Because these policies are essentially screening tourists and selecting tourists with better and more stable financial capabilities.&quot; Fuzi believes that in this way, tourists can make more money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the following month, Ayu Martini, Indonesia’s Deputy Minister of Tourism and Creative Economy, said that as of now, no reservation is required for Bali travel, and Indonesia’s visa policy has not changed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to relevant plans previously formulated by the Indonesian government, Indonesia strives to receive 3.5 million to 7.4 million international tourists in 2023, and the foreign exchange revenue from the tourism industry will reach at least 2.07 billion US dollars. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;“The key lies in passenger flow management”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When Taiwanese youth Chen Zhiwei went to Venice for the first time, In addition to admiring the cityscape, he was also surprised by the number of tourists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“You can see faces from different countries everywhere in the local area.” Chen Zhiwei said that the most common means of transportation on Venice Island is buses and boats, and each boat is always full of people. &quot;From morning to night.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Venice, this beautiful city known as the &quot;City on the Water&quot;, is located on the Adriatic Sea in northeastern Italy. It has always been a tourist attraction for tourists from all over the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/245f13e5c4.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;607&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/245f13e5c4.JPG&quot; data-key=&quot;258865&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Venice, the &quot;City on the Water&quot;, is a tourist attraction for tourists from all over the world. The picture shows tourists on a gondola ride in Venice. (Yao Jiatong/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, conflicts occur from time to time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once, when Chen Zhiwei was visiting Pisa, he was told at the train station that the last train was temporarily cancelled. Since hundreds of locals and foreign tourists were stranded at the scene, the train station sent a return bus, but it could only accommodate 40 people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At first, the staff allowed tourists with children to get on the bus first, but this quickly aroused the dissatisfaction of locals who could not get on the bus. They complained that it was all due to too many tourists, causing even the bus to run out of time. Can&#39;t sit down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Many locals surrounded the bus and refused to let the driver drive away.” Chen Zhiwei said that who got on the bus and who stayed behind became the fuse of conflicts. After physical conflicts broke out between locals and tourists, many police officers were deployed to resolve the issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, many tourists, including Chen Zhiwei, could only stay overnight at the train station and wait for the train the next morning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 13, 2023, Venice announced a policy that starting in the spring of 2024, tourists entering the city during peak periods will need to pay 5 euros (approximately 39 yuan). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, the Venetian government hoped that the money could be used to improve residents&#39; facilities and infrastructure. They &quot;had to deal with overflowing bins&quot; and rubbish thrown on the streets by tourists. At its peak, the number of foreign tourists outnumbered locals by about five times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Zhiwei is accustomed to things like &quot;taxation&quot;. For example, when staying in a hotel, many hotels charge a &quot;city tax&quot;, which is usually two or three euros a day, and it will be shown on the bill. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;After the money is collected, it will actually be used to help maintain the city and deal with problems arising from tourism.&quot; Chen Zhiwei said that it is reasonable for foreign tourists to bear some maintenance costs while traveling. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;External public opinion believes that excessive tourism has caused many locals to leave their hometowns. The introduction of taxes and fees such as &quot;tourism tax&quot; can offset harmful effects such as waste resource pollution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/88eac1abe8.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/88eac1abe8.JPG&quot; data-key=&quot;258866&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Many netizens complained on social platforms that the difficulty of parking at international celebrity tourist attractions is a thorny issue. (Yao Jiatong/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ivan Saprov, founder of the American travel technology company Voyagu, said that sustainability-related charges are not difficult for tourists to accept. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They conducted a survey and found that nearly 40% of tourists said that charging fees was okay and expressed support for this, saying that the income generated could be used to create pleasant experiences for tourists and locals. Facilities and Services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that in order to restrict foreign tourists, homeless people and other people who spend the night outside, the Venice government has made efforts to install benches in public places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Zhiwei observed that there was a strange raised shape in the middle of some benches. Locals told him that the purpose of this was to prevent tourists and homeless people from sleeping on the benches and reduce their stay in public areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like Venice, Croatia has introduced &quot;rules&quot; or instructions for tourists to prevent unruly behavior related to drinking. This includes requirements for appropriate attire in historic areas, prohibitions on alcohol consumption and gathering in public places where alcohol is prohibited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ina Rodin, director of North America at the Croatian National Tourist Board, said a code of conduct is a way of informing visitors of acceptable behavior at a destination. &quot;But compliance is often limited.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/043a1631e0.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1620&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/043a1631e0.JPG&quot; data-key=&quot;258867&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Many places set &quot;rules&quot; or instructions to prevent unruly behavior. The picture shows a policeman issuing a ticket at the entrance of an Italian town. (Yao Jiatong/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, as one of the most famous tourist destinations in the world, Venice’s current core area population is less than 50,000. During peak tourist seasons, the number of tourists sometimes exceeds twice the resident population. The huge foot traffic has caused serious problems over the years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zurab Pololikashvili, Secretary-General of the United Nations World Tourism Organization, said in an interview that the key to solving overtourism lies in the management of passenger flow. He noted that new technologies can help solve this problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, towns in northern Germany use lidar sensors installed on self-driving cars to manage tourist flow. To combat crowding without sacrificing tourism revenue, some countries are attracting tourists to less crowded areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend intern Bao Jingyue also contributed to this article)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https: //feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt; br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[最高检挂牌督办山西永聚煤矿火灾事故案]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260962]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-20 18:10:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On November 16, a major fire accident occurred in the joint building of Yongju Coal Mine, Lishi District, Luliang City, Shanxi Province. 26 people have died, 34 people have been hospitalized, and 4 people are under observation in outpatient clinics.

Resolve differences peacefully, avoid escalation of the situation, and take practical and effective measures to ensure security and stability on the China-Myanmar border. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 8, the Myanmar National Governing Council (junta) held a meeting of the National Defense Committee. The Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar Army, General Min Aung Hlaing, made it clear at the meeting that the attack launched by the Kokang Allied Forces was intended to retake the Kokang. control and regain the benefits of drug production and trafficking, while its allies, the Ta&#39;ang Army and the Kachin Independence Army, also have their own political goals. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Chaos in northern Myanmar, the impact of &quot;making quick money&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Northern Myanmar has been in a state of war for a long time. A large number of ethnic minority local armed forces, Myanmar government troops and minority groups recruited by the government forces The militia groups transformed from ethnic local armed forces are fighting with each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the main contradiction exists between the local armed forces of ethnic minorities and the government forces, under certain circumstances, some ethnic minority armed forces will cooperate with the government forces to a certain extent to target other ethnic minority armed forces. ; In some cases, the militia groups recruited by the government forces will turn against the government forces again, so that on the one hand, the government forces need to rely on the support of the militia groups as local people to deal with the local militias; on the other hand, they also maintain a high degree of vigilance against the militia groups, everywhere Limit it to prevent it from getting too big. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The causes of Myanmar’s civil war are long-standing and complex. This involves the need to face the ethnic chieftain system left over from the feudal dynasty in the construction of the Myanmar nation-state, as well as the British colonists&#39; political tactics of strengthening support for ethnic chieftains and countering the majority Bamar ethnic group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What cannot be ignored is that in the 1960s, after launching a coup and seizing state power, Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar Army Ne Win adopted an impatient attitude in building a nation-state and tried to divide the national identity into three Sixty-nine and so on, forcibly promoting the assimilation of ethnic minorities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the area where ethnic minorities occupy nearly half of Myanmar’s territory, dozens of ethnic minorities who have lived here for generations suddenly became second- and third-class citizens overnight, and even their national identity cannot be guaranteed. What they lose is not only political rights, but also the most basic land property rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To this day, this attitude of &quot;the land is important but not the people&quot;, which has not been completely changed, is the most fundamental reason for the armed resistance of ethnic minorities in northern and southeastern Myanmar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Myanmar is not a developed country, and areas inhabited by ethnic minorities such as northern Myanmar are even more remote and underdeveloped. The long-term consumption of war has completely complicated the problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the Burmese Army recognizes the legitimacy of their political status, in reality, the Burmese Army’s military expenditures are not generous, and the supply of their weapons, equipment and personnel costs is basically better than nothing, which often leads them to “use drugs” &quot;Raise the Army&quot; route. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Burmese army often adopts a indulgent attitude towards this. If controls are strengthened, it is easy for the vigilante groups to rebel again and become local militants. If the vigilante group collapses immediately, he will also lose a powerful arm. Therefore, this delicate balance is also an important reason for the rampant criminal activities in northern Myanmar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the shortage of military funds, the income of the military and police at the grassroots level of the Myanmar government is too low. At the beginning of 2021, a &quot;nest case&quot; occurred in Tachileik, a city in northern Myanmar, in which some military and police collaborated to shelter drug trafficking. For this reason, Myanmar The military government had to make major changes to the local military and police departments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The huge profits of drugs are also the reason why the &quot;alternative cultivation&quot; model that the international community once seriously promoted has made occasional progress in northern Myanmar, but has always had little effect. If we can find another way to &quot;make quick money&quot; that is not so eye-catching to the world and is as profitable as the drug trade, this will be quite attractive to various ethnic groups. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, in the past ten years, when &quot;online gambling&quot; was hit hard again, it quickly turned into widespread electronic fraud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, on the one hand, the Kokang Allied Forces will indeed deal a heavy blow to the electronic fraud problem in northern Myanmar; on the other hand, it may also make the future situation in Myanmar more complicated. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Each one has his or her own agenda&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Although the Kokang area is only a tiny corner of the country compared to the whole of Myanmar, judging from the scope of this war, it is obviously beyond The scope of boldness. Not to mention that the direct goal of the Allied Forces is to regain control of the Kokang region. As allies of the Allied Forces, the Ta&#39;ang Army, Arakan Army, People&#39;s Protection Army (PDF) and Kachin Army, their demands are obviously not to combat electronic fraud. But for its own benefit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Ta&#39;ang Army is fighting for a controlled area around Muse City in Myanmar, and may be able to achieve a status similar to today&#39;s Wa State in the future; the Arakan Army and the Kachin Army are pursuing in Rakhine State and Kachin State to establish an independent country; and the People&#39;s Protection Army (PDF)&#39;s primary goal is to overthrow the military regime throughout Myanmar...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the Allied Forces recapture Kokang, it may become a landmark event, prompting other civilian armed organizations to Political desires are rising again. In addition to the civilian armed organizations that have not signed the &quot;Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement&quot; with the Burmese army, other organizations that have signed the agreement and even those that have accepted the reorganization of the Burmese army into &quot;border defense battalions&quot; may again There is a change of situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is undeniable that the current relative strength gap between the Myanmar Army and the above-mentioned organizations is the biggest driving force for them to unite and cooperate in combat. There is no doubt that this has indeed caused considerable pressure on the Myanmar Army. It is worth noting that the political demands of various local armed forces and the People&#39;s Protection Army vary greatly. In the future, internal conflicts may escalate and become prolonged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If a long-term and large-scale war breaks out in Myanmar, not only may traditional security issues such as the dispersion of weapons and the impact of refugee waves occur, but also if the De&#39;ang Army occupies the Muse Port, and considering that the Qingshui River Port has been captured by the Allied Forces, The land trade channel between China and Myanmar will be greatly affected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More importantly, the consumption of war will inevitably stimulate the recurrence of certain phenomena in the &quot;feeding the army with poison&quot;, &quot;feeding the army with gambling&quot; and the current &quot;feeding the army with fraud&quot; that civilian armed groups originally relied on. It may have reared its head, or it may have turned to other more novel models of &quot;black and gray industries&quot; again, causing more complex security issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some local armed groups in northern Myanmar are likely to cause some hidden worries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the phenomenon of &quot;large mixed settlements&quot; of various ethnic groups in northern Myanmar is very common, which will undoubtedly cause them to fall into a series of problems in terms of territory and population management, creating hidden dangers of future conflicts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the natural and human conditions in northern Myanmar are quite limited. If these areas become independent, it will be difficult to form pillar industries other than minerals, and they lack financial self-sustainability. Even if a legal government is established, its stability There will be problems with the country and social governance capabilities. Coupled with the presence of a large number of cross-border ethnic groups in the region, domestic conflicts may eventually spill over and affect regional stability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, the consequences of a divided Myanmar may seriously affect regional stability. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Can it be &quot;crushed&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the past, the reason why the Burmese army was able to crush ethnic armed groups was mainly due to its size and resource advantages in the Burmese areas. , the only obstacle that is not easy to overcome is the geographical situation of civilian areas. This advantage has been greatly weakened after the &quot;2.1 coup&quot; in 2020. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The NLD government has a very strong appeal in Myanmar, especially within the Bamar ethnic group. The coup of the Burmese army caused serious divisions within the Bamar ethnic group and seriously weakened the Burmese army&#39;s war sustainability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Only from a comparison of military strength, the Burmese army can theoretically increase its troops on a large scale in northern Myanmar to solve the danger of the siege of Kokang. However, the current large-scale increase of troops itself will bring considerable risks to the Burmese army. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In areas dominated by the Bamar ethnic group, the People&#39;s Protection Army is already spreading everywhere. Once heavy troops move north to the empty hinterland of Myanmar, how can they not seize this opportunity? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the Burmese army adopts measures such as mobilizing reserves to expand its army first and then move north, there will also be several obstacles: not only will it make the already poor financial situation further difficult, but it may also allow the Baojun and other pro-NLD forces to further infiltrate Within the Tatmadaw, causing more trouble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the Burmese army passively accepts the reality, it will first severely damage the personal prestige of the Burmese army leader. After all, the political capital that started his career was the decisive solution to the Peng Jiasheng armed forces in the &quot;8.8 Incident&quot;; the top brass of the Burmese army If there are changes, it will inevitably have a greater impact on Myanmar&#39;s overall political situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What decision the top brass of the Myanmar military will ultimately make is obviously a question worthy of attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Myanmar, in the future, the Myanmar Army may be able to reach a certain compromise with the ethnic armed groups through political negotiations, and then turn around and focus on targeting the People&#39;s Protection Army. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, the reverse may also be true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Burmese army and the NLD forces reached a compromise, and the People&#39;s Protection Army gradually fell silent. The Burmese army was free to suppress the local armed forces back to the previous state. This could result in a long period of largely barely stable Myanmar, punctuated by minor conflicts. This is also a tragedy for Myanmar itself, which means that the Myanmar people have to endure more pain, but it is better than the situation of the country being divided and losing its autonomy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is another result, which is less likely but still exists, that is, after the Burmese people achieve internal reconciliation, the Burmese army will finally rely on its own size advantage to completely suppress the local armed forces within a certain period of time, at least Unifying the mountains and rivers in form. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the future, the autonomy of ethnic groups in northern Myanmar will be effectively guaranteed, especially the clear division of power between the central government of Myanmar and the local autonomous governments of ethnic minorities, which will ensure the development and development of ethnic minority areas in northern Myanmar. The simultaneous development of Bamar areas is the fundamental move to truly eradicate the source of trouble in this area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this idea is still a castle in the air before today’s political and social reality in Myanmar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 17:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“中华老字号”不是护身符：历史招牌只是其表，商业信誉才是其里丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260947]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-20 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, the Ministry of Commerce and other five departments issued the &quot;Notice on Announcement of the Review Results of Chinese Time-honored Brands&quot;, which will lead to long-term poor management. , or even 55 brands that have gone bankrupt, canceled, closed down, or lost the ownership and use rights of time-honored registered trademarks, have been removed from the list of Chinese time-honored brands; 73 brands with poor operations and declining performance are required to be rectified within 6 months; 1,000 brands will continue to be retained A brand with standardized operations and good development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Chinese time-honored brand&quot; is not only a title/title, but also an officially certified identity/qualification. The &quot;remove, rectify, and retain&quot; measures taken by the five departments to &quot;remove, rectify, and retain&quot; &quot;Chinese time-honored brands&quot; just allow the outside world to rethink the true connotation of &quot;Chinese time-honored brands&quot; and analyze the right and wrong behind &quot;Chinese time-honored brands&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The official definition of the so-called &quot;Chinese time-honored brands&quot; refers to &quot;long history, products, skills or services that have been passed down from generation to generation, with a distinctive traditional Chinese cultural background and profound cultural heritage, and have gained widespread social recognition.&quot; recognition and form a brand with good reputation.” From the literal meaning, &quot;inherited from generation to generation&quot; can be interpreted as &quot;historical and cultural traditional value&quot;, while &quot;products, skills or services are widely recognized by society&quot; can be reduced to &quot;commercial reputation and market status&quot;, which is also the construction of &quot;Chinese time-honored brands&quot;. &quot;Two pillars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The connotation of &quot;Chinese time-honored brands&quot; is the &quot;traditional cultural background and profound cultural heritage&quot; behind it, or is it the market position and business reputation won in competition? The two cases in this notice can be said to be the answer to this question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the &quot;time-honored brands&quot; that have been removed from the list, Inner Mongolia Dashengkui and Anhui Beggar Chicken are two typical cases: Dashengkui lasted for hundreds of years from the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty to the Anti-Japanese War. &quot;Yin Yuan Bao Pu&quot; ruled two thousand miles of trade routes in Mongolia. When it resumed business more than ten years ago, it also placed many people&#39;s expectations on reviving the old brand; Anhui beggar&#39;s chicken is said to date back to the Hongwu period of the Ming Dynasty. Although this legend is false and true , but the reason why it was expelled from the &quot;time-honored brand&quot; is not its historical and cultural authenticity, but its poor management in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to see that the history of Dashengkui is more authentic, but this does not save it from the bad luck of being &quot;delisted&quot;; Anhui Beggar Chicken has doubts about its history and culture alone, but the last thing that crushed it The straw is probably not an academic verification of authenticity, but a defeat in the competition in the modern catering market. In fact, there is more than one &quot;Beggar&#39;s Chicken&quot;. The &quot;Daoxiang Village&quot; and &quot;Guanshengyuan&quot; that have been removed from the list this time also have brands with the same name. The reason why they failed to pass the review of &quot;Chinese Time-honored Brands&quot; is not because of &quot;historical and cultural traditional value&quot; &quot;Something went wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In fact, for these &quot;Chinese old names&quot;, if you cannot embrace the latest changes in the market, you cannot self -innovate to meet the needs of consumers, and it will inevitably die. On the other hand, if a brand is enough To create a new product and service, even if it is not old, it will slowly occupy the consumer&#39;s mind and become a new tradition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The phenomenon of &quot;traditional invention&quot; has long been noticed: those who seem to seem to be ancient &quot;traditions&quot;, the origin of its origin is often very late, and sometimes it is invented. . This point is not uncommon in the Chinese context, that is, the common &quot;family genealogy&quot; and &quot;recognition ancestor&quot; phenomenon in the workshop. Many &quot;traditional origin&quot; recognized by the &quot;old name&quot; is often suspected of academically. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Facts have proved that whether a tradition really has the continuity of historical and cultural, and whether it can really stand academically, it is not that this tradition is widely accepted The key factor, it can be said that it is not important. Regardless of these &quot;old names&quot;, even if the establishment of a new company with a long time is not long, they often do some &quot;inventions&quot; or even &quot;legend&quot; on &quot;brand stories&quot;, but no consumers will be like professional historians. The same goes to delve into a bit of false in this, but it will be more inclined to spread these wonderful stories. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Whether in China or in Europe and the United States, such cases abound. The history of &quot;diamonds is long and long, a forever spread&quot; is actually far away, but this advertising word and the brand value behind it seem to be ancient. Favorite; &quot;Eight Crepeles Series&quot; often claims to be their millennium history, but its real origin can only go back to the mid -Qing Dynasty, but this does not affect the reputation of major cuisines. After all Whether the account is true than its history is true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Of course, this is not that the authenticity of the &quot;old name&quot; is not important at all. The &quot;century -old shop&quot; of &quot;one eye&quot; will still make people look at it, and then it is suspected of false publicity. In other words, the quality of commodity services, the choice of consumers, and the judgment of the market can enable a company and its brand to gain business reputation, reverse the brand value of the company, help enterprises to spread their own brand stories, let the &quot;old name&quot; &quot;old -fashioned&quot; of the &quot;old name&quot; The brand can stand. If the &quot;old -fashioned&quot; is reduced to the &quot;amulet&quot; of the enterprise, it makes companies feel that they can &quot;lie down&quot; by this, and even rely on the brand&#39;s old masses to not improve business management and do not pay attention to the quality of commodity services, then the famous result and unrealistic result can be realized. Even if you can&#39;t even keep your name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Therefore, for a &quot;old -fashioned enterprise&quot;, the list and trademark are just their tables, and the long -term business reputation is the in it. A &quot;old Chinese name&quot; can maintain its business reputation that does not fall, relying on a paper list or a trademark, but consumers&#39; sincere recognition of it as a traditional Chinese brand. The changes in the times will eliminate some &quot;old names&quot;, and will also retain some old -fashioned names, and will also create a new &quot;old name&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[奶茶按公斤炫！新疆人豪横起来连东北人都害怕]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260575]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-20 15:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Recently, the hot search of milk tea in Xinjiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Some netizens have pictures to buy milk tea in Xinjiang, and a cup starts at 1kg, which has caused the public&#39;s heated discussion about Xinjiang&#39;s &quot;big&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The air in Xinjiang seems to have a film powder. As soon as the food comes to Xinjiang, it will &quot;expand&quot; several times. For example, 10 kinds of Xinjiang food, including Xinjiang No. 1, Biglet Chicken, Ten Thousand Powder Soup, the largest oil cake tower, and tens of thousands of people, and other 10 kinds of Xinjiang cuisine have set a Guinness World Record for its &quot;big&quot;.

In fact, Xinjiang people do not have a catty and two concepts. The &quot;one pound&quot; in their mouths is actually one kilogram. Because of the &quot;big&quot; of Xinjiang, they gave birth to their own measures -22 airports in a province in Xinjiang, within 1,000 kilometers in their eyes, are very close, and 1,000 kilometers are enough to travel from Beijing to Taiyuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In addition to the large amount, the low price of Xinjiang cuisine has also made the Northeast, which has always been known as affordable. According to the data of the public, the top ten restaurants in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, only cost 74 yuan per capita, which is lower than the average price of provincial capitals in the three provinces of the three Eastern provinces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Large area and large amount, and the &quot;brain hole&quot; of Xinjiang people is also large.

In 1940, the Gansu Provincial Working Committee of the Communist Party of China was destroyed. Luo Lili, who was 8 months old, was arrested at the same time as his parents. After several twists and turns, he was imprisoned in Lanzhou Dashagou Prison, where he spent 6 years. Wang Luobin, who was also in prison, asked Luo Lili what the most delicious food in the world was. Luo Lili, who had never been exposed to the outside world, thought it was broad beans that he had eaten by chance. Wang Luobin composed the song &quot;Soybean Ballad&quot; from this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A while after leaving the venue, the crowd suddenly surrounded an old man. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The old man has appeared on CCTV 13 times.

He is proud that he &quot;didn&#39;t make a single mistake&quot; when talking. &quot;, and sometimes, I even have to play and sing &quot;In That Distant Place&quot; on the stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But the old man in front of him has droopy eye bags and a lot of white hair on his sparse head. He kept taking out performance tickets from the small shoulder bag on his chest, a total of 40 tickets, which belonged to &quot;old friends&quot; he had met through cooperation in the name of his father. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Most of these &quot;old friends&quot; reached the peak of their careers in the 1990s.

He once participated in the Northwest Anti-Japanese War Theater Troupe with Xiao Jun, Seke and others. He was also highly appreciated by the warlord Ma Bufang and formed a children&#39;s theater troupe in Qinghai. During China&#39;s darkest period, he captured a hint of romanticism, and some of the songs he was most proud of in his life were born here, including &quot;In That Distant Place&quot; and &quot;Youth Dance.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At half past seven, &quot;Soybean Ballad&quot; started.

Among the three sons, the eldest went to Australia in the 1980s. The second child was a truck driver and died of illness. After surviving a period of history, the four fathers and sons now only have the third child left. Therefore, interviews, authorizations, rights protection, concerts, commemorations, and publications all fell on Wang Haicheng. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, for a long time, the identity of &quot;Wang Luobin&#39;s son&quot; made Wang Haicheng breathless. When he was 8 months old, Wang Luobin was arrested, followed by a search of his home. A month later, his mother passed away in the hospital bed. Relatives in Beijing did not dare to have contact with the Wang family. After hearing about it, the fifth uncle in Zhuozhou drove a carriage all day and night from Beijing in the early winter in the north to bring the body back from Beijing and bury it in a wheat field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A few years ago, Wang Haicheng tried to find his mother&#39;s tomb, but he could no longer find it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Studying stopped in the second grade of junior high school. When it was time to go to the mountains and countryside, Wang Haicheng stayed on the farm for nine years because of Wang Luobin. When groups of educated young people returned to the city one after another, he also got a nickname: &quot;Cushionzi&quot;. This dialect refers to the last puppy out of a litter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Family is never a place where the singer is willing to devote his attention. Wang Haicheng wrote that the union between his father and his mother was due to the breakup of his father&#39;s previous relationship, so he wanted to take revenge on his life. Wang Luobin was born free. He went to the grassland, to the market, and even in prison, collecting folk songs. A producer who visited the singer&#39;s deeds mentioned a detail. In his later years, Wang Luobin rode a bicycle everywhere. When it got dark, he would lie on the road and fall asleep, and then go home the next day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Luobin passed away in 1996. Wang Haicheng immediately joined the China Music Copyright Association and registered 207 musical works recorded, organized and created by Wang Luobin with the association. He became increasingly aware that his father had left a shining legacy. Since 2000, Wang Haicheng has successively published two biographies of Wang Luobin, a song sheet of Wang Luobin, invested in TV films, and a long narrative poem. Four exhibition halls have been created in Turpan, Xinjiang, Haibei, Qinghai, Baishui Ancient Town, Dabancheng, Xinjiang, and Liupan Mountain, Ningxia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is difficult to say how father&#39;s love plays a subtle role in Wang Haicheng&#39;s life. In order to guard this heritage, he was like an ascetic, stationed in the Grape Valley of the Flame Mountain for 16 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the first few years of the 21st century, the Turpan Wang Luobin Music and Art Museum in Grape Valley was the only temple to commemorate the king of singers. This building has an Ottoman-style white circular dome and 80 panels displaying the singer&#39;s life. Visitors came in the 40℃ high temperature. When they opened the door, they saw the sweaty son of the singer wearing a shirt with Wang Luobin&#39;s logo in front of him. There were biographies, song collections, tapes and records on the counter. When the operation of the art museum was most difficult, Wang Haicheng went to bring in strange stones from the Gobi Desert that looked like pork belly and English letters. This is the most popular commodity in Xinjiang’s tourism market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He also set up an incense burner in front of his father&#39;s portrait - Wang Luobin converted to Buddhism in his later years. There was once a man who claimed to be a physicist and kowtowed three times directly to the portrait. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Haicheng honed his speaking skills, pondered the details of his father&#39;s life, paid attention to his image, and never refused any opportunity to appear in the national media. The comment that moved him most came from an old man from Shandong: &quot;Wang Haicheng, you are the biggest filial son in China.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On July 24, 2022, Wang Luobin Music was located in Putaogou, Turpan, Xinjiang Art Museum.

Ethnic minorities hold weekly house music gatherings. Seven days and nights after the song &quot;Forgetting Love Water&quot; reached Urumqi, the shops in the Grand Bazaar would use rough-sounding speakers to play versions in other languages. The bars all over the street are full of singing bands. On the radio, the male host can talk endlessly about the Beatles, Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yibo, the director of &quot;Looking for Wang Luobin&quot;, was the popular host of the Urumqi Economic Radio program &quot;Music Leisure Island&quot; at the time. After more than 20 years, she believes that Urumqi at that time showed tolerance for all kinds of music and was the &quot;center of Asian music.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But there is no local singer&#39;s name in popular music. His limelight comes from outside Urumqi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Luobin was rediscovered in the context of an era where order was brought to order. In May 1981, on an afternoon when the temperature suddenly soared to 33°C and the snow suddenly melted, in a five- to six-square-meter concierge at the Qianjin Theater, Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhao Quanzhang met Wang Luobin, who had just been released from prison. In Zhao Quanzhang&#39;s reminiscence article, this person who looked like Quasimodo in &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; was unemployed, had no household registration, and did not even have &quot;food and oil connections.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhao Quanzhang wrote the internal reference for Wang Luobin, and soon received instructions from Song Renqiong, then head of the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Zhao Quanzhang once recalled that the work of bringing order to the country was not completely smooth at that time. The resolution of Wang Luobin&#39;s problem had an impact on Xinjiang and the whole country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Openness was the theme of the 1980s. And for a musician who has experienced the war of resistance, prison, and rehabilitation, is there any symbol more suitable to glimpse a country&#39;s path of exploration? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the autumn of 1988, &quot;Eight Thousand Miles to the Clouds and the Moon&quot; hosted by Taiwanese artist Ling Feng went to Xinjiang to interview Wang Luobin. This was the first program from the other side to introduce China. TV programs about mainland China’s customs and customs. Then, Xia Jie, a female writer from Hong Kong, China, also came to visit and wrote three articles. Soon, Singapore, Australia, North America, and overseas Chinese had someone to pay attention to. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The media calls him the King of Western Singers and enjoys special government subsidies. China Record Corporation awarded him the Golden Record Special Creation Award, and UNESCO awarded him the &quot;Promote &quot;Special Contribution Award for Cultural Exchange between East and West&quot;. But all the medals are inferior to the gifts given by the people. In the era when the word &quot;fan&quot; only refers to fans, Wang Luobin&#39;s most proud example is, &quot;Chinese friends said that at least half of the two million Chinese in the United States can sing. &quot;In that distant place&quot;&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A more well-known story is that Sanmao, a female writer from Taiwan, China, moved directly into the home of the singer, and scandals abounded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Trouble is coming quietly. One day in 1993, Luo Dayou&#39;s agent called. Not long ago, Rolling Stone Records released the tape &quot;Love Song Anniversary - Luo Dayou and Wang Luobin&#39;s Great Collaboration of the Century&quot; without Wang Luobin&#39;s consent. The King of Songs was very angry and took Luo Dayou to court for infringement of his copyright. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Greater controversy ensued. Someone revealed that Ling Feng paid 20,000 yuan to buy out ten of Wang Luobin&#39;s songs, including &quot;In That Faraway Place&quot;, &quot;The Girl from Dabancheng&quot;, &quot;Mayila&quot; and &quot;Youth Dance&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The music issue soon turned into a political issue. Someone asked, can Wang Luobin sell folk songs that belong to the people? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A major discussion that lasted for more than a year began. In June 1994, &quot;People&#39;s Music&quot; magazine began to discuss the copyright issue of Wang Luobin&#39;s folk songs. Dai Penghai, an associate researcher at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, published two articles criticizing the news media for hyping up Wang Luobin, and also accused Wang Luobin of &quot;selling out the people&#39;s sovereignty and interests in national music culture.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are also people who support Wang Luobin. Liu Zaisheng, a professor at the Music Department of Shandong Normal University, pointed out that “collecting brotherly ethnic songs in different languages ​​is a more complex and difficult task, and the translation and dubbing of lyrics often plays a key role in success or failure.” And “if we combine the When the lyrics are analyzed together, it is not difficult to find that they have formed Wang Luobin&#39;s unique creative style that is lyrical, colloquial, and popular.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another background to the great discussion is that during China&#39;s &quot;resumption of customs&quot; negotiations, the Copyright Law was promulgated in 1991, which stipulates that &quot;adaptation, translation, The copyright of works resulting from the annotation and arrangement of existing works shall be enjoyed by the person who adapted, translated, annotated and arranged them.&quot; In other words, if Wang Luobin &quot;adapts, translates, annotates, and organizes&quot; folk songs, the copyright of the new songs belongs to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But, does changing one note, two notes, or a chorus count as &quot;adaptation&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On August 5 of that year, a symposium attended by more than thirty people was held in Beijing, including musicologists, composers, and legal professionals. people and journalists. The person presiding over the meeting was Qiao Jianzhong, then director of the Music Research Institute of the China Academy of Arts. He later recalled in an article that this symposium was actually an &quot;absent criticism&quot; against Wang Luobin, which was very explosive. However, the meeting finally reached a consensus that Wang Luobin had worked hard in recording, translating, editing, and adapting folk songs, but the rights he enjoyed needed to be quantitatively analyzed before the rights could be determined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The eighty-year-old singer was very hurt and left the stage to participate in the debate in person several times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;With the death of Wang Luobin in 1996, the big discussion did not continue. But this discussion could have clarified some fundamental issues, such as the quantitative standards for adaptation and the copyright of folk songs. In that era, Wang Luobin was not the only one who encountered similar problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Shanghai, a young man who was writing &quot;The Complete Works of Xian Xinghai&quot; was also troubled by this problem. In the process of sorting out Xian Xinghai&#39;s works, Wu Yuebei, a top student in the composition department of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, checked and filled in the original scores. Some melodies that he thought were not harmonious even needed to be changed. When Xian Xinghai&#39;s descendants heard about Wang Luobin&#39;s dispute, they worriedly asked, if the original score was adjusted, would the copyright belong to him? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After consulting the leaders of the Ministry of Culture at the time, &quot;The Complete Works of Xian Xinghai&quot; was finally processed as follows: the works with major changes were also included in the revised original works. version, as well as a more substantial adapted version. For revised or revised editions, the name of the reviser will be marked as a footnote at the end of the work, but no copyright will be generated. The edited version will have a copyright page marked with the name of the organizer, who owns the rights to the content compiled by him in the new version, but not the rights to the original work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This young man majoring in composition has no way of knowing that after more than 20 years, he may end the discussion about the copyright of the singer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Wang Luobin and Luo Dayou.

Wang Haicheng suddenly discovered that everything his father left behind could be easily taken away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, China was in the midst of a heat wave to achieve modernization through a market economy. The &quot;resumption of customs&quot; turned into &quot;joining the WTO&quot;, a stable and international The integrated legal system is gradually improving. Intellectual property rights are a focus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2002, Wang Luobin&#39;s adaptation of &quot;Tall White Poplar&quot; was sued by the family of a deceased musician for copyright infringement. The family members believe that &quot;Tall White Poplar&quot; is not a folk song, but a song composed by the late musician, originally titled &quot;How Beautiful My Garden is.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The family did not sue Wang Haicheng directly, but first sued an audio-visual company in Guangzhou. The CD published by the company labeled &quot;Tall White Poplar&quot; as a folk song. The court found that the song was composed by the late musician. Afterwards, the family took this judgment and sued Wang Haicheng, claiming 230,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Haicheng said that &quot;Tall White Poplar&quot; was written by his father in 1969 while serving a sentence. At that time, a young man was unjustly imprisoned, and his new wife died. The young man stopped cutting his hair and shaving. Wang Luobin felt inspired and adapted &quot;Tall White Poplar&quot; based on an Ili folk song. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A friend in Yili told Wang Haicheng that the original version of this ancient folk song can be found in the local archives. But before he was about to leave, the friend said that the information was missing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In August 2004, the court of first instance sentenced Wang Haicheng to pay compensation of 237,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the appeal, Wang Haicheng and his lawyer began to think about how to collect evidence. In October 2005, he and his lawyer pretended to be collectors from Beijing and spent 4,600 yuan to buy a small video camera. After arriving in Yili, they arranged to grab mutton and invited local music teachers and old people who could sing folk songs for interviews. At first, they did not reveal their interest in &quot;Tall White Poplar&quot; and started talking about Ili folk songs. The cameras are always working. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the conversation was almost over, Wang Haicheng turned to &quot;Tall White Poplar&quot; and asked if there was an original folk song version of this song. Everyone said yes, and everyone hummed a line. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But when they reveal their identities, very few people are willing to testify. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After hitting a wall one after another, they finally found three old people willing to testify. I also met an &quot;Avanti&quot; (meaning &quot;teacher&quot;) named Ishamuddin, who said that the original song had probably been circulated for two hundred years, and he also knew that a lawsuit was ongoing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, Wang Haicheng thought that if he lost the lawsuit, &quot;things would develop like dominoes.&quot; Dozens of publishers had published this song Society will also be in crisis. Even if he travels to Hainan, he will pray with Mazu, hoping that Mazu can help him, the son of the king of singers, who is in trouble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On May 8, 2006, the Xinjiang High Court made a judgment that the two songs each enjoyed property rights in copyright. In Wang Haicheng&#39;s words, &quot;Both songs come from folk songs, and they are in a parallel relationship.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At almost the same time, Wang Haicheng launched a blanket rights protection campaign that lasted for several years. For the sake of copyright, he fought against pirated CDs, KTV bosses, and singers who randomly covered his father&#39;s works. His opponents include audio-visual city vendors, publishers, university professors, as well as Li Yuchun, Tan Weiwei and Wang Sulong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It was in 2004 when he was ordered to pay 237,000 yuan in compensation that Wang Haicheng received an unfamiliar phone call. The other party introduced himself like this: Ju Yonghe, a native of Jiangsu, a lawyer in Beijing, and a loyal fan of Wang Luobin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When they finally met a year later, Wang Haicheng was deeply impressed by his &quot;uprightness and non-joking&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;He said that he was concerned that there were many publications infringing Wang Luobin&#39;s rights on the market, and he especially wanted to help protect his rights.&quot; Wang Haicheng was &quot;a little nervous financially at the time, and he was also weighing Should I file a lawsuit?&quot; Lawyer Ju dispelled his concerns: He would bear the cost of the lawsuit. If he lost the lawsuit, he would not ask Wang Haicheng for money. If he won, he would pay half of it after deducting travel expenses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This may be a more subtle way, and it also uses legal weapons to confirm again and again that Wang Luobin owns the copyright to a certain song. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since 2005, Lawyer Ju has continued to make efforts. He went to the audio and video market and Xinhua Bookstore, walked around, saw the allegedly infringing publications, bought them, issued invoices, and sued. &quot;All those audio and video publishers came to me to ask for authorization. They can also use high-definition pictures of Wang Luobin on the covers of their publications. I also provided the introduction of Wang Luobin on the inside pages. It is more accurate and the text is smoother.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Luobin became an inviolable icon. Around 2010, Lawyer Ju moved to KTV. In the words of the time, it was a &quot;mopping up&quot; operation. KTV&#39;s infringement made Wang Haicheng even more intolerable. The scenes in &quot;In That Distant Place&quot; were of Hainan beaches and bikini beauties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Based on the Yangtze River Delta, Lawyer Ju gradually expanded the scope of his operations. In his eyes, &quot;the judicial environment in the Yangtze River Delta was relatively good at the time.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Victory is like a snowball getting bigger and bigger. In the eyes of some people in the music industry, even what didn&#39;t belong to him before, now belongs to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to Wang Haicheng, the economic benefits in this round were not as much as people imagined. The compensation involved in the case that he received was &quot;about 120,000 yuan.&quot; &quot;. But he is very happy and feels that this battle is going smoothly and &quot;the pirated KTVs have been beaten into silence.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In this battle, he gave himself an indestructible meaning: to maintain his father&#39;s eternal status in the history of Chinese music. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But this blanket rights protection came to an abrupt end in 2013, and Wang Haicheng was put in a tight ring. After mediation by the Supreme People&#39;s Court, Wang Luobin&#39;s descendants reached an agreement: some of the previous lawsuits should be withdrawn. &quot;If the lawsuit cannot be withdrawn, the accepting authority should proactively notify the accepting agency to add Wang Haiyan (eldest brother) and Wang Haixing (second brother) as co-litigants.

Bancheng Girl was born in 1938, while Alam Khan did not appear until May 1944. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;One ​​reason is that Wang Luobin rarely signs his name. He compiled a book called &quot;Song of the Northwest&quot; related to the Anti-Japanese War. The back cover said &quot;Compiled and printed by the Gansu People&#39;s Anti-Enemy Support Association.&quot; Wang Luobin said in his autobiography, &quot;I think this work is a citizen&#39;s duty.&quot; In this special era, many of his songs were not signed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Hai wrote three biographies of his father, a large part of which is about tracing his father&#39;s creative story. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But it was 1974 when he first heard his father talk about his creative motivations. One day, the father and son went to a friend&#39;s house to celebrate their child&#39;s full moon. With the wine mixed with alcohol, everyone booed and asked Wang Haicheng to sing. He took over the guitar, finished singing &quot;Manli&quot;, and vividly talked about the origin of the song. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;There was a pair of lovers on the Mongolian grasslands. During the Anti-Japanese War, the man signed up to join the army to fight. The woman heard from the rear that the man had died. She was very sad and died of illness. &quot;The man came back from the war and heard that his fiancée was dead, so he ran to the cemetery and sang this song in front of her grave. Suddenly, this woman stood up from behind the grave again.&quot; Wang Haicheng recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Luobin, who was no longer very talkative, took a sip of wine and said: &quot;Today is so interesting. My son sang a song by Lao Tzu. I didn&#39;t know that the song was from Lao Tzu.&quot; &quot;Written.&quot; It was a pornographic song, and criticism of it reached its peak in the 1950s. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;More stories were collected during the period when I temporarily lived with my father at my second brother’s house. Father and son sleep in a small room together, with two beds on the left and right and a window in the middle. During the day, Wang Luobin opened the bed and used the bed board as a table to copy music scores. &quot;He did not forget to revise the songs while copying them, and he sang them while writing.&quot; At night, the mosquitoes kept the two awake. On nights like this in the 1970s, Wang Haicheng asked his silent father again and again: I heard that there is a song that is also yours? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But this experience will not be helpful until Wang Haicheng writes his father&#39;s biography 30 years later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After his father passed away, it became more difficult to find songs. The problem of songs was sometimes a legal issue, and sometimes even a political issue. There is only one song whose origin does not need to be searched by Wang Haicheng, and that is &quot;In That Distant Place&quot;, the &quot;Crown Pearl&quot; of the King of Western Songs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1939, Wang Luobin followed director Zheng Junli to Qinghai to shoot the movie &quot;Long Live the Nation&quot;. Dolma, the daughter of a Tibetan head of thousands of households, was chosen to be the shepherdess. Wang Luobin Become a helper. While driving the sheep, Wang Luobin accidentally whipped his horse&#39;s buttocks. Dolma on the horse swung the whip and hit Wang Luobin gently. Thus, there is the plot in the lyrics: &quot;I would like to be a little lamb/follow her side/I would like her to hold a whip/keep hitting me gently every day.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The singer himself has told this story to the media too many times. But maybe it’s just that there are so many stories that one day in the future, people with a heart will begin to compare the time, place and characters of each story, and discover flaws that are difficult to correct. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Luobin also told actor Ma Yue. The actor won the second prize in bel canto singing in the amateur group of the Youth Singing Competition in his early years. Once he held a solo concert at the Beijing Opera House. After singing &quot;In That Far Place&quot;, an old man with a goatee came to him and said, &quot;Ma Yue, you look a lot like me when I was young.&quot; Second. The sentence is, &quot;You sang my song inaccurately.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;That was 1994 when the big discussion was launched. The singer pointed out two of his mistakes, one of which was that the tune was wrong, &quot;I was in prison, and you were singing my songs outside. Now I sing the song back to its original form, and everyone says I sang it wrong. I You can&#39;t change it back.&quot; - Many people don&#39;t know that the widely sung &quot;In That Faraway Place&quot; is indeed not the version written by Wang Luobin. His version and the score are now engraved on his tombstone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Afterwards, the two met twice, and the singer added about the spread of the song. He said, &quot;Among the frontline anti-Japanese officers and soldiers, there are many people who sing. Why? Because there is a good girl in the heart of every anti-Japanese soldier.&quot; This young man, whose career was on the rise, realized that &quot;all of Wang Luobin&#39;s works grew out of the soil of the nation.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Wang Haicheng and his father Wang Luobin (right).

The second round of rights protection launched by Wang Haicheng in 2019 has just suffered a defeat. In June 2023, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court&#39;s final judgment determined that Wang Luobin and his descendants no longer enjoyed the copyright of &quot;Kangding Love Song&quot;, &quot;Four Seasons Tune&quot; and &quot;Under the Silver Moonlight&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;9 months ago, the Intermediate Court of Yangzhou City, Jiangsu Province identified Wang Luobin as the copyright holder of &quot;Kangding Love Song&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Different from the rights protection that came to an abrupt end ten years ago, the defendants this time are mostly professionals in the music industry and publishing houses.

This aroused Wang Haicheng&#39;s dissatisfaction. In his opinion, 9 films including &quot;In That Distant Place&quot; belong to Wang Luobin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Using an inappropriate metaphor proposed by the other party, it is the relationship between grandfather and grandson.

The family members of one of the defendants also discovered that the authenticity of those stories written by Wang Haicheng and the song king&#39;s creation is open to question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This defendant&#39;s family member is Wu Yuebei, the young man who participated in the compilation of &quot;The Complete Works of Xian Xinghai&quot; more than 20 years ago.

The defendant Gong Yaonian is his father-in-law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The second round of rights are turbulent. At the beginning, the defendants each fought.

He hoped that he would continue to work hard and adapt a few more Wang Luobin&#39;s works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In June 2017, Wang Haicheng sent another solo concert list of Changji College, which was printed with the words &quot;Young Dance&quot; Hu Tingjiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; It didn&#39;t take long for him to be prosecuted. The subpoena was sent from all over the country, and Hu Tingjiang remembered that the courier in the community was sent to the court courier every day, and he was very puzzled, &quot;What did this family commit?&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Until a trial live broadcast, Hu Tingjiang, who was fighting alone, learned that Gong Yaonian was also prosecuted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Soon, these prosecution professors, musicians, and publishers formed an alliance of interoperability information.

Earlier, the authorities planned to cancel the subsidies of the student&#39;s consumption of coal and were opposed by the students. After the &quot;Coal Incident&quot;, students began to seek autonomy in a school in the subtropical canyon. At the same time, they couldn&#39;t wait to find some deeper things from the soil of folk songs from the soil of folk songs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; At that time, the situation was unknown, but this group of music students began to worry more eternal issues. In the first series of &quot;Chinese Folk Songs&quot; they printed, there is such a wish: &quot;After analyzing these folk songs, the problems that have not been paid attention to in Western composition can be produced. . &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p style =&quot; text-align: left; &quot;>; There was no way to pick the style at the time. According to a memories article by Xie Gongcheng, the first series of&quot; Chinese Folk Song &quot;was from&quot; New Music &quot; Magazine, Yan&#39;an&#39;s small singing book, Wang Luobin&#39;s &quot;Northwest Folk Song Collection&quot; and private relationships, more than a hundred national songs collected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; This &quot;Northwest Folk Song Collection&quot; was published in Chongqing in 1942. At the end of 1939, Wang Luobin gave the manuscript to the reporter Zhang Xiluo, a reporter from Chongqing in Xining to publish it, and Zhang Xiluo found the opportunity until he opened the Dagong Bookstore. The collection of the Capital Library shows that the song collection contains 17 songs, and there is no &quot;in the distant place&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; During the collection of &quot;Chinese Folk Songs&quot;, the students of the piano group were responsible for the accompaniment, and the vocal group was responsible for the singing. There are two teachers joining, namely the professor of the composer and the director of the teaching affairs, Chen Tianhe, and the professor and director of the composition department, Jiang Dingxian. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; History has a bifurcation here. Although Volkswagen regards Wang Luobin as the benchmark of the western folk songs, the college faction has also paid attention to Wang Luobin, but in the music education of professional colleges, the history of the folk song system has begun to start with the &quot;folk song movement&quot; of the Shan Song Club. When it comes to &quot;Alamu Khan&quot;, they will think of Xie Gongcheng&#39;s four chorus adapted in 1945; when it comes to &quot;Kangding Love Song&quot;, he will think of Jiang Dingxian; and when it comes to the &quot;Pearl on the Crown&quot; of the Song King, The person they think of is Chen Tianhe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; There is only one reason. The accompaniment of this song popular version is equipped with Chen Tianhe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Wu Yuebei looks for clues from Wang Luobin&#39;s own words. &quot;People&#39;s Music&quot; magazine published an article &quot;History is fair&quot; written by Wang Luobin in 1994, which mentioned that &quot;in the distant place&quot; can allow his colleagues, a lady named Ug Huiying to testify as a testimony. &quot;It can not only prove that this song was written by me, but also proved that this song should have copyright.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Ugly Huiying at the time was the chairman of the Taipei Music Copyright Association. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Wu Yuebei found the &quot;Northwest Folk Song Collection&quot; compiled by Ugly Huiying in 1967. A total of 88 songs, 84 of which are edited by Ugly Huiying, and &quot;in the distant place&quot; is marked as Chen Tianhe arranged. Interestingly, the version of Chen Tianhe is currently a small version, and it is engraved with the tombstone of Wang Luobin, which is a big version. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In 1994, Ugly Huiying presented a &quot;Selection of the Chinese National Ballad&quot; by her in 1982 by her in 1982.

As for &quot;In the Far&quot;, only &quot;Qinghai Folk Songs&quot; are written. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; These two versions seem to contradict each other. From the north of Wu Yue, two key issues are explained. First of all, there is no version of Wang Luobin published by Ug Huiying. Secondly, according to the analysis of Wu Yuebei, the reason why the second version has the names of ugly Huiying and Chen Tianhe, it is that the version of the &quot;removed &#39;part&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; This is actually an old topic in the 1990s discussion.

The adaptation must be incremental, for example, a folk song is changed to a symphony. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; And, folk songs have its particularity. The folk song is a song created by the public. The words and songs have been continuously polished and deformed by countless people. According to different times and place, different versions will be generated. Wu Yuebei also gives an example, &quot;You change the&quot; In front of the bed, the moonlight &quot;to the&quot; In front of the window, the moonlight &quot;, are you going to replace Li Bai?&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; He found a &quot;Selection of Chinese People&#39;s Songs&quot; published by Shan Ge Society in 1946, which selected a small version of &quot;In the Far Far&quot;, which stated that &quot;Chen Tianhe is accompanied by accompaniment&quot;. According to the survey of Wu Yue, a female student in Qinghai sang to Chen Tianhe in 1945, and the latter spent the piano song for this. Wang Luobin&#39;s version was officially published in 1983 &quot;Selection of Luobin Songs&quot;. Wang Luobin knew that the existence of a small version was also attached to the book, but he explained that this was the result of the female student who went to school in Chongqing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In some circulating statements, the female student was Ugly Huiying, who graduated from Chongqing National Music Institute in 1947. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The memoir called &quot;Walking through the Memory Star&quot; also inadvertently mentioned Ugly Huiying and Wang Luobin.

It is mentioned that in August 1993, Luo Wenzhi met with Tang Ying Ugly Huiying in Beijing. During the chat, Ug Huiying said that in 1993, Wang Luobin reunited with her in Taipei, and learned that she had spread her &quot;The Far Far&quot;, &quot;Youth Dance&quot; and &quot;Daban City Girl in Dazya City&quot; in Qinghai for many years.

According to Liang Maochun, a professor at the Central Conservatory of Music, in 1940, a musical named &quot;Flower of the Desert&quot; was staged in Xining. The &quot;New Music&quot; magazine published in November 1942 reported the matter. The &quot;Songlin&quot; magazine published in December of the following year records the complete script and music of the play. In the preface of &quot;The Song of Desert&quot;, Wang Luobin mentioned that the episodes used in the play are all Kazakh people&#39;s songs, with new words. &quot;I Want to Be a Shepherd&quot;, which is the predecessor of &quot;The Far Far&quot;, appeared in the first act. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; History meets the narrow road here, but as the parties leave the world one by one, some statements have been difficult to verify. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In 2023, the opinion of the lawyer is that the signature on any or several &quot;earliest publications&quot; cannot prove that the signature is 80 80 Author of a certain song a year ago.

In the 1990s, many friends and teachers, including Dai Penghai and Xie Gong, had participated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; One more important reason may be that Wu Yuebei is responsible for a national folk song inheritance project.

They all found that society pays attention to new series of lawsuits. Not high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Until today, there are still Wang Luobin&#39;s memorials in Pakistan, Hubei, Baishui Ancient Town, and Urumqi. Member of the CPPCC also hopes that all children in Puzhou will sing Wang Luobin&#39;s song. In early September 2023, at a lecture at the Three Gorges University, Wu Yuebei mentioned this protracted copyright dispute, but the audience at the scene did not know who Wang Luobin was except the teacher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Today, the person who knows the western song king most lives in a 26-storey commercial house in the north of Lazhou. This is a residence purchased after Wang Haicheng was moved by the enthusiasm of Lizhou officials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Most of the time, Wang Haicheng is a long-awaited and strictly restricted old man. Once, he took me to the old factory in Puzhou to check the construction progress of the Wang Luobin Music Art Museum. He indirectly reached a call, and the other party wanted to buy Wang Luobin&#39;s manuscript. He was full of &quot;good&quot;, hung up the phone, and made a look at me. &quot;I asked others to know that Wang Luobin&#39;s son sells manuscripts, which is incredible.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; He is easy to be excited, especially when it comes to these difficult and from the academic opponent, he will doubt the motivation of the opponent and admire their cunning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; It is difficult to confirm whether Wang Haicheng understands these complaints from the professional music circle. In this commercial house, he continued to move out of his published Wang Luobin&#39;s work and several thick Xinjiang folk songs, and repeatedly emphasized that the change of a note and a word is the result of his father&#39;s exhaustion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;Uyghur is a multi-syllable, Chinese is a single syllable, and the Han people say that good is &#39;good&#39;, Uyghur said that a good one is&quot; To sing the Chinese folk songs in Chinese, it must be a big surgery for it. &quot;Wang Haicheng can also give more examples. For example,&quot; Alamu Khan &quot;is adapted to the Children&#39;s Troupe of Qinghai, so it has been added for half a rest, which is convenient for convenience Children breathe when singing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The 72-year-old man still needs to answer the &quot;love&quot; between his father and Sanmao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;I have seen it, eating at my house, my wife gave Sanmao noodles, eaten two meals, and told me to talk to me when I have come, I have been here for several days. Today this day is the most comfortable &#39;. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p style =&quot; text-align: left; &quot;>;&quot; I understand her, there is a kind of &quot; Feeling, she wants to integrate into her home, and she wants to live with my father. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p style =&quot; text-align: left; &quot;>; Once valid. His &quot;My Father Wang Luobin&quot; Douban score is 7.9, and many people have burst into tears. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In the Library of Laizhou, the photos of Sanmao were placed on a desk that was used by Wang Luobin, which was moved from Xinjiang. Wrapped wrapped, Wang Haicheng said that all of this was arranged according to Wang Luobin&#39;s life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; But in the photos of Wang Luobin and desk he showed afterwards, there were no three-hairy photo on the table. He also explained that the photo was actually placed on the cabinet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Now, some stories are invalid. The Tianjin High Court determined that the &quot;Mayera&quot; adapted from Hu Tingjiang was not infringed; during the trial of Hu Tingjiang&#39;s version of &quot;Youth Dance&quot; case, the Hubei High Court directly stated in a 34 -page judgment: If Wang Haicheng and others have the demands of rights, then then It is tantamount to &quot;belonging to the right of primitive folk songs.&quot; The Hubei High Court also ordered a series of &quot;risks&quot; after litigation: Once supported rights protection, Wang Haicheng and others can be based on Wang Luobin&#39;s first work, and arbitrarily initiate lawsuits in other homologous works in the subsequent subsequent. This is undoubtedly &quot;harmful to the right to the original folk song.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Another reason is that the world left by his father, Wang Haicheng spent half a lifetime and continued to construct. Those who accused Wang Luobin of no copyright may disappear all this smoke. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; He is the child who has won Wang Luobin from the three brothers. So far, he will play the piano every day and play with the guitar. If anyone says he and Wang Luobin are very Like, he will show a sincere smile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Wang Luobin did have a dream to let his songs sing for 500 years. So far, the longest Chinese songs are said to be &quot;Jasmine&quot;, which has been circulating for nearly 400 years. In 1794, I finally met the Macanloni Mission of the Emperor Qianlong, ready to return to Britain from Guangzhou. Here, the group secretary John Baro heard the Guangzhou dialect version of &quot;Jasmine&quot;. He was in &quot;China Travel&quot; The song was recorded with Roman Pinyin and translated lyrics, becoming the earliest record in Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; So, who is pushing the eternal universe of the western song king and let it slide into the abyss of forgotten? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Perhaps, all this has nothing to do with the law. All cultural idols will disappear in time. At first, it was their fall, and then the fans were old. Idols may be mentioned briefly at a certain moment and a certain period -but this is only accidental. In the end, they will sink into the long fog again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; How many people remember, this year is the 80th anniversary of the birthday of Sanmao? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;September 10, 2023, Hebei Library Library, Sanmao&#39;s photos are placed on the right desk, Wang Haicheng is playing&quot; Youth Dance &quot;.

He is now Chinese music. Professor of the Department of Music of the College. He just discharged from the hospital, his face was rosy, his hair was silver, and he often made a strong laughter. In the afternoon of the same day, a male tweeter came to visit and heard about Wang Luobin. He talked: &quot;Wang Luobin&#39;s songs dare not touch, and we (units) have also defended.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left ; &quot;>; In the summer of 1982, Du Yaxiong was still a young man. He lived in Wang Luobin&#39;s house to help him organize the score. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Recalling the summer of forty years ago, Du Yaxiong has a feeling of vagueness. Wang Luobin did not understand the origin of his song. &quot;After all, he is not engaged in us. This major (ethnic music), we know whether a song belongs to a folk song or a song, which is very clear. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; National music began in 1959. Dutch musicians, who have been dispatched by Java for 15 years, renamed the 3rd edition of his book &quot;Music&quot; to &quot;National Music Science&quot;, which created this discipline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Wang Luobin told Du Yaxiong that the song &quot;Dadal and Maria&quot; was sang by a Kazakh old lady in Xining, Qinghai around 1940. Including &quot;Maura&quot;, Wang Luobin believes that these are folk songs, but Du Yaxiong does not agree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;People who have studied Kazakhson folk songs can be seen that these are not folk songs. Why? Kazakh folk songs have specific rhythm, a song divides the main song and chorus song In the two parts, the lyrics of the main song must be 11 syllables, their combinations can be 344, 443, 434. Each combination is a sound step. &quot;Du Yaxiong said,&quot; There is still a rule, that is, the combination The lyrics and songs are consistent, and a phrase of the Kazakh folk song has ended, but the word has not been sang, and the last voice of the first sentence should be placed in the second music. The first sound of the last lyrics in the last music festival. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p style =&quot; text-align: left; &quot;>; Du Yaxiong speculates that this way of presenting this music is likely to come from the daily life of the Kazakh people. Life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;There is a swap mechanism for nomadic peoples. Young people will not stay in the tent and go sheep. , Riding the horse, 200 meters away from the tent, first &#39;ah 呺 —&#39; shouting, someone in the tent, he will come out to tie the dog, and use &quot;Ah 呺 —&quot; to respond to you. &quot;This Scholars who studied the history of music have added a naughty supplement, &quot;but I am not necessarily right.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; What if it is not a folk song? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Du Yaxiong understands Kazakh. After inquiring from many parties, he finally found the author of &quot;Da Dar and Maria&quot; and &quot;May&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The author of the first song is Mary Jagel (1887-1950), born in Acko Mora, Kazakhstan, is Kazakhstan. Stan people artist. Du Yaxiong inferred that she created the song around 1903. This song has been widely circulated in Kazakhstan, once the theme of many music works. Judging from Wang Luobin&#39;s record, at the latest in the early 1930s, this song was introduced to China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The author of the second song is Marrara Shammustinovova (1890-1927), Professor Ah Hedi, Aramutu Conservatory of Music McDIS Jubanov introduced this person in the book &quot;The Nightingale of the Times&quot; and said that the song was the author&#39;s &quot;self -portrait&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Du Yaxiong also verified &quot;Girl in Daban City&quot;. Cut the rhythm. He was curious why Wang Luobin&#39;s version was not like this. Wang Luobin&#39;s saying was that the driver he heard was singing -not Wang Haicheng said, but the active version of the version suitable for the Han people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Regarding &quot;Youth Dance&quot;, Wang Luobin told Du Yaxiong: &quot;It was recorded in Jiuquan Dongguan in 1939. The lyrics were original, not me. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p style =&quot; text-align: left; &quot;>; As for the&quot; pearl on the crown &quot;, Du Yaxiong does not think that the popular version is the result of&quot; tuning &quot;, but a version of the male cavity, using&quot; Anti -tuning &quot;method creates a female cavity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Therefore, in the 1983 &quot;Selection of Luobin Songs&quot;, Du Yaxiong divided the songs into two parts, the first part was the folk song, the second part was Wang Luobin&#39;s of Creation, and these songs are in the first part. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; However, Du Yaxiong also affirmed the contribution of Wang Luobin&#39;s translation of ethnic minorities. Translated into Chinese, it is too difficult, translation is to see Yada. Of course, some things are not right with the original, he is a half -compiled and half translation. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In fact, Wang Haicheng still won part of the victory in the final judgment of the Beijing Intellectual Property Court. The court determined that Wang Luobin and his descendants continued to enjoy the copyright of &quot;Daban City Girl&quot;, &quot;Da Dar and Maria&quot;, &quot;Mayra&quot;, and &quot;in that distant place&quot;; for &quot;Youth Dance&quot;, he enjoys lyrics copyright. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; But Wang Haicheng still determined that someone is accelerating the disappearance. Not long ago, when Beijing Normal University produced the musical &quot;The Ballad of the Past&quot;, some people proposed that &quot;in the distant place&quot; may be controversial. The school conveyed was reported by a lawyer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The lawyer&#39;s name is Dong Xiaoyue, the granddaughter of Chen Tianhe. She also has a persistent life. When holding a chorus competition in high school, some students mentioned that &quot;in the distant place&quot; belongs to Wang Luobin, and she will scratch others. Chen Tianhe died in 1955. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Dong Xiaoyue after the 80s became a reporter and book editor, but from time to time, she held her. Around 2010, she began to find the &quot;Selection of Chinese Songs&quot; from the major libraries in Beijing. The earliest version of this book has only two volumes in China. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; It is like the result of a period of life, Dong Xiaoyue became a lawyer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Someone once asked her to charge the copyright fee. She replied in a letter: &quot;It should not be entangled in the copyright dispute, let everything follow the wind. The problem of music does not need to be given to the law. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p style =&quot; text-align: left; &quot;>; The young Wang Luobin more than 80 years ago would not expect that the copyright and origin of a song will be far away. It will become so important in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In 1935, at the age of 22, he worked as a music teacher at a middle school outside Beijing&#39;s Xizhimen. There is a river nearby. At noon in the summer, he ran to the river to swim, and there were many college students who moved after the fall of the Northeast. One day, the naked and mud people listened to their classmates to read &quot;August Village&quot;. This novel describes the story of the Northeast military and civilians fighting with the Japanese invaders after the &quot;September 18th&quot; incident. When I read a poem called &quot;I want to fall in love, I also want the freedom of the motherland&quot;, Wang Luobin, full of passion, wore clothes, copied the poem down, and went home to compose. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Later, a young man found it and said that his songs were well written or sang well, but do you know who the novel author is. Wang Luobin was embarrassed and did not know. The young man laughed and said, &quot;The author is Xiao Jun, I am Xiao Jun.&quot; Wang Luobin recalled: &quot;I was shocked, so the two of us hugged, laughed, and became friends.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;span style = &quot;font- FAMILY: Kaita, Kai Trioons_GB2312, Stkaiti; &quot;>; (Southern Weekend Intern Huang Xiaoying also contributed to this article) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;IMG Alt =&quot; September 10, 2023, Lizhou, Hebei, Hebei, Hebei, Wang Luobin&#39;s former residence memorial.

JPEG &quot;Data-Key =&quot; 258849 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to media reports, many parents now take their children to be&quot; children&#39;s drift &quot;in Hengdian to find the opportunity to appear in film and television dramas. The life of &quot;Tong Diao&quot; is also very bitter. &quot;100 people grab a seat&quot;, &quot;Earn 250 yuan in 4 months&quot; and &quot;paying a lot of money with the capital&quot; are the norm of many &quot;children&#39;s drifts&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; There are media statistics, in 2022, in the film, online dramas, TV dramas and other film and television cultural works filmed in Hengdian, 230 minors participated in the performance of minor entertainers, with more than 6,000 people. This number is not small, and it is the reason why &quot;Tong Diao&quot; exists -Hengdian does provide an opportunity to act in acting and famous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Of course, with the influx of children and their families, &quot;Children&#39;s Drifting&quot; quickly became inside. It is difficult for the &quot;Tongfu&quot; industry to say that it is a pure dream chasing story, but has evolved into a strange capital game. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;In 2,000 years, at least 3 plays can be guaranteed in one year, and you can appear in special actors. In 53 years, at least 8 dramas in 3 years, you can be able to play special actors and characters.&quot; This is the charging model of several children&#39;s brokerage companies in the media report. According to the &quot;members&quot; of various levels, it is equipped with corresponding resources according to the amount paid. Obviously, for families who lack an economic foundation, &quot;Tong Diao&quot; is very cruel and the return rate is extremely low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Another problem of &quot;children&#39;s drift&quot; is that the main body of dreaming is children. If they are in a kind of irregular situation, what should I do? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The compulsory education law stipulates that children, parents of adolescents, or other legal guardians shall ensure that they are accepted on time and complete compulsory education in accordance with the law. If the parents let the child leave the school early for a child star dream, they are suspected of illegal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Even if the child completes compulsory education, the basic education is too weak. This impact may be lifelong. The cost of &quot;children&#39;s drift&quot; is too huge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Therefore, for the risk of &quot;children&#39;s drift&quot;, parents should have more rational and comprehensive assessment. &quot;Being a wrist and becoming a horns&quot;, after all, has huge uncertainties. Family gambling everything to fight a very low probability of probability. Is this wise? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; And children do not have full capacity for civil behavior. They have not yet fully aware of their nature of their behavior. Many children really like acting, but they lack cognition about &quot;sinking costs&quot; -once the acting path is blocked, how can children return to conventional growth paths? Children are ignorant about this, and if parents lack prudence, it is undoubtedly an irresponsible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Of course, there is no need to criticize the &quot;children&#39;s drifting&quot; and his family to make too high criticism. Some common criticisms on the Internet, such as &quot;taking children as a tool for making money&quot; and &quot;Parents have a dream of getting rich&quot;, are not accurate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It can be seen from the interview that many parents are just because their children want to act and want to help their children dream. They may not be a parent who wants to smoke, which is essentially no different from asking children to &quot;read famous schools&quot;. They all chose a road with a very internal curler and unclear prospects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; While persuading parents to maintain prudential, society should also intervene. For example, whether the acting brokerage company is formal should actually attract the attention of relevant departments. Some parents reported that the &quot;bringing capital into the group&quot; was suspected of suffering from fraud.

In accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance, half of the provincial lottery public welfare funds have been paid in the central government and half of the provincial finance. The Internet sales lottery broke the regional restrictions. The developed provinces of the Internet economy, sales will rise, and the number of public welfare funds staying in local finance will increase. The provinces dominated by offline sales will inevitably bring public welfare funds. This is easy to cause bad competition for lottery sales between provinces. It not only breaks the original public welfare fund raising and distribution pattern, forms new uneven rich and poor, but also has various market chaos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; From the perspective of Su Guojing, if the lottery industry does not introduce higher levels of law, &quot;do not clarify the responsibilities and rights in Internet sales, you will not be able to completely solve the problem thoroughly &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 11:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[去扬州看东坡：到心仪之地，施仁爱之方]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260929]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-20 10:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong>; Pingshan Hall Si Yiduo &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;ban>; Yangzhou once stayed in the generations of Junjie densely.

&lt;p>;苏轼对欧公的感情，不同寻常。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;欧阳修一向举贤好士，他隆重奖掖苏轼，更是天下尽知。当时流行的太学体文风追求迂曲深奥、艰涩怪僻，欧阳修等有心匡正。仁宗嘉祐二年&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（1057年）&lt;/span>;春，欧公作为礼部省试的主考官，将“词语甚朴，无所藻饰”的苏轼擢为“论”试的第二名。本届进士中名人辈出，嘉祐贡举被视为“千年科举第一榜”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一些志在必得的知名考生落榜后，愤懑不满，有人恶作剧写下祭文投往欧公家。还有浮薄士子围堵欧阳修，在他的马前喧哗鼓噪，“群嘲而聚骂者，动满千百”，巡逻的士卒难以制止。不过从此以后，病态的文风渐渐被扭转了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;欧阳修对三苏评价都高，苏轼丰美畅达的文字，更是令他拍案叫绝。给梅尧臣的信里，他乐滋滋地说：“读轼书，不觉汗出，快哉，快哉！老夫当避路，放他出一头地也。可喜，可喜！”这是文坛前辈发现优异后生的喜不自禁，更是天才对天才的惺惺相惜。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;欧公的提携之恩、期许之情，令东坡终身感念，他说自己“受知最深”。元丰七年&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（1084年）&lt;/span>;东坡由黄州赴汝州，十月经过扬州时，再次踏入平山Hall.他“每到平山忆醉翁”，这回也不例外。壁上墨迹依旧，恩师却已仙逝，距离最后一次见面已经十余年。东坡以一阕《西江月》深挚怀念欧公，也感慨光阴似箭、世事虚幻：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;em>;三过平山堂下，半生弹指声中&lt;/em>;&lt;em>;。 &lt;/em>;&lt;em>;十年不见老仙翁，壁上龙蛇飞动。 &lt;/em>;&lt;em>;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;王士祯的《花草蒙拾》说：平山堂地势不高，环境普通，“然以欧、苏词，遂令地重。”楼台亭榭一旦沾染贤人君子的光泽，或被丽辞鸿篇加持，就备添神韵。即使廊柱檐角已被时光磨蚀，依然不朽。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;平山堂几废几兴，现存建筑为同治年间重建，后来屡次大修。它让逸兴雅怀有所附丽，也凝集了一段动人的师生情谊。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;半年能够做什么&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;待到东坡也以知州身份来到扬州，已是平山堂建成40多年后。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;哲宗元祐七年&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（1092年）&lt;/span>;二月，东坡在颍州接到任命，移知扬州，他非常乐意。三月到任，在扬州不足半年，这么点时间很难有所作为吧，他却以善政令百姓感怀。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;东坡爱花，栽花赏花赠花簪花叹花，跟花朵各种互动。他笔下的梅兰菊荷、牡丹、海棠、山茶、杜鹃，或秾丽或幽洁，或一枝独秀，或满树争妍。他也很能领略芍药的妩媚，题画诗《赵昌芍药》云：“扬州近日红千叶，自是风流时世妆。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;东坡到任后，却做了一个大煞风景的决定：停办万花会。他写信告诉好友王巩：万花会已成为扬州大害，停办“虽煞风景，免造业也。”其《以乐害民》一文说：扬州芍药为天下之冠，万花会用花十余万枝，既破坏各家花园，胥吏也借此扰民损民，扬州人非常不满，“予始至，问民疾苦，遂首罢之。”他认为万花会是“以一笑乐，为穷民之害”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;北宋文人张邦基的《墨庄漫录》记载：万花会始于蔡京知扬州时，此后年年延续。停办花会，“人皆鼓舞欣悦”。张邦基点评道：苏公为政基本上都是这样，让百姓受惠，所以被他们称颂。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从颍州赴任扬州途中，东坡目睹了百姓艰难求生、流离失所的惨状：沿途城邑都有许多流民，因无力偿付积欠&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（欠官府税赋）&lt;/span>;，不敢归乡。行至乡间，东坡经常屏去吏卒，走访村落。父老皆满面忧戚地哭诉：今年虽然夏麦成熟，但丰年催缴积欠更严苛，“胥徒在门，枷棒在身，则人户求死不得。”东坡也忍不住流泪。他两次上奏章：臣曾经知杭州、颍州，现在又到扬州，“亲见两浙、京西、淮南三路之民，皆为积欠所压”，日益困厄，流亡、死亡者过半。淮、浙积欠最多，又连年遭灾，吏卒在上级驱督下催收，对平民日日威逼鞭挞。百姓如何安生？朝廷的仁政又如何体现？东坡“昧死一言”，请求朝廷暂停一年催缴，“使久困之民，稍知一饱之乐”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;依苏轼所请，朝廷六月一日下诏，淮南东西路、两浙路的积欠暂停一年催理。他喜不自禁：“诏书宽积欠，父老颜色好。再拜贺吾君，获此不贪宝。颓然笑阮籍，醉几书谢表。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;东坡经过调研，对税务、仓法、漕运等也提出改良意见，兴利除弊。门生李廌的《师友谈记》等记载：以往官府准许纲运的船夫私载货物，用以补贴收入。他们往往视官船为家，随时修葺，行船速度也快。近年严禁私载，结果舟坏人贫，漕米等比从前损耗数倍，公私皆亏；有的船工因饥寒偷盗货物，拆卖车船。扬州、楚州、泗州等州，众多船工遭鞭笞、发配，还有的沦为乞丐盗贼。东坡上奏折建议恢复旧例，得到朝廷准许。弊端消除，公私皆受益，也无人因此受刑。李廌引用《左传》的话感慨：“仁人之言，其利博哉”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;平山堂之北的谷林堂是东坡所建，现存建筑为清末重建。它与平山堂之间，由红色梁柱的走廊连接。跟谷林堂东侧一墙之隔，即大明寺的大雄宝殿。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;堂额“谷林堂”三字，集自东坡的法帖。楹联“深谷下窈窕；高林合扶疏”则来自他的诗《谷林堂》。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;谷林堂的整体感觉，比平山堂似乎少一丝隆重意味，从礼仪的角度看，合乎长幼之序。当然，布置得也很丰满，大堂与东、西厢的墙上，有欧阳修、梅尧臣、苏氏兄弟的画像与《嘉祐贡举图》《赤壁夜游图》等，书法则有东坡临颜真卿《争座位帖》与他的《获见帖》《一夜帖》等。橱窗里陈列着黄色封面的《宋刻东坡集》和四库全书的《东坡书传》等。墙上整齐排列“苏门四学士”的诗牌，其中晁补之的七律《招缙云守关彦远、教授曾彦和集平山堂》，写于他邀约曾彦和等在平山堂聚会时：“蜀冈势与蜀山通，龙虎盘挐上紫空……少师杨柳无遗迹”，从后一句看来，晁写诗时欧公柳已经不存。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;元祐七年&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（1092年）&lt;/span>;八月东坡得到诏命，担任兵部尚书兼南郊郊祀卤簿使。朝廷屡次催促，东坡九月抵京。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;晁补之是兵部侍郎杜纯的女婿，东坡履新，恰好是杜纯的顶头上司。考虑到岳父与老师以前不曾近距离相处，担心他俩不那么投缘，晁补之向东坡介绍了杜纯立身处世的风格，以及当官任职恩及万物的优点。后来岳父来信称，与东坡共事得还不错，不过觉得他“尚气好辩”。晁补之回了一封长信，详述苏公为人为政的高风亮节：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;补之于苏公为门下士，无所复赞。然刚洁寡欲，奉已至俭菲，而以身任官责，嫉邪爱物，知无不为，尤是不忽细务，其有所不得尽，视去官职如土芥。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;晁补之直言不讳地反驳岳父——并不觉得苏公有此毛病：“来书犹怪其尚气好辩，此非补之所能知。”还提醒岳父：人非圣贤，各有短长。他举西汉名臣汲黯与郑当时的例子：两人性情各异，有不同的光芒与瑕疵，但司马迁并称其贤能。所以“君子以同而异，若是可也。”晁补之认为，各位贤者在朝堂和睦，则地方的好尚也跟朝廷一致，那就没有什么事是做不成的。这位女婿跟岳父辩理，维护师尊，还真是较真。晁补之在苏门四学士中受知最早，他对苏公的敬慕，可见一斑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;走到谷林堂北侧的小园，这一角比较安静。一组假山，几株老桂，桂花横斜的枝丫掩映青瓦屋脊，高挑的枫杨、竹子在风中摇曳。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/nDQX5lQW91ibVFGxj7x2nuGqLXrSXsTQnNm6K4di.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;谷林堂建成后，东坡也在堂边的树林里喝过茶吧？ &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;写诗差点又惹祸&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;与瘦西湖的喧嚣迥然不同，竹西公园人迹稀疏，一派清幽。它位于古运河畔，1989年在竹西寺遗址一带兴建。里面景致不错，似乎像扬州人自家的后花园，没有太多外人打扰，悄无声息地漂亮着。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;雨后空气清凉湿润，成片的银杏、桂花、松、竹、红枫等，愈发明洁清新。茶花开得正旺，海桐繁密细碎的米白色花朵，沁出清淡的香味。浅山、草亭、石桥、盆景，以及几处故址旧迹，各有可观。竹西精舍的左侧，立着吴道子画像、李白题赞、颜真卿书写的三绝碑复制件。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;竹西寺位于蜀岗之尾，冈势至此趋于平缓。相传蜀冈的地脉与蜀地相通，泉脉也跟蜀江相连，所以东坡将竹西寺的水称为乡味，他要把含有故乡味道的井水携往江南的新家。真是惬意。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;没想到，后来他差点再次以诗罹祸。元祐六年&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（1091年）&lt;/span>;东坡任翰林学士、知制诰时，政敌为罗织罪名，居然翻检陈年旧事，说元丰八年三月神宗皇帝驾崩，苏轼写诗竟将此视为“好语”，乐不可支。东坡赶紧上奏札申辩，说自己三月上旬在南都哀悼先帝之后，返回常州。五月初去竹西寺，“见百姓父老十数人，相与道旁语笑。其间一人以两手加额云：&#39;见说好个少年官家&#39;。”臣喜闻百姓讴歌少年天子，出于至诚；加之请求归耕常州得到批准；路过淮、浙，又看见丰收在望，因此作诗，还题于寺庙墙壁上。假如我有任何不善之意，怎敢公然示人？而且那时离先帝仙逝已经两个月。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总算有惊无险。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/2AJvSxYhhCzzu7cHQHHFiYe4YGT1ujJQenAXUU4h.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot;

The soil in this corner, I do n’t know how much the fluttering and melting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由唐至清，吟咏竹西寺的诗词不计其数，文学史上的璀璨人物，好些在此留下履迹墨痕。风流欲绝，惹人遐想。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;假如用胶片再现他们的身影，应是这般模样：杜牧在秋雨后踏着蝉声而来，周边青苔满阶，桂花飘萧；张祜游罢繁华的十里长街，前往竹西寺，伫立月明桥上，痴看美人游弋，叹一声要死就该死在扬州；东坡的动作特别多，进了寺院先饮鸡苏水，后喝莺粟汤，又借来藤床瓦枕，躺平了享受竹风清凉，临走还不忘汲一罐井水，再蘸墨在墙上题诗。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他的“影像”素材最丰满、活络。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[抢课大战后，年轻人在夜校找到了生活的盼头]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260905]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-20 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;倒计时归零后，系统崩掉了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了准备这场抢课大战，90后女生吉姆特地制作了一张表格，志愿按照优先级排列，分别是非洲鼓课、手碟课、银饰制作课和扎染工艺课. The plan couldn&#39;t keep up with the change. On August 11, the system collapsed as soon as it opened.她幸运抢到了一个非洲鼓课的名额，“跟抢演唱会门票一样，”她说，“要有信念感，我一定要抢到。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;500元，12节课，每节课一个半小时。 2023年秋天，一项颇具年代感的群众生活——夜校突然在社交平台上受到追捧。 According to data from Meituan and Public Comment, the search volume of &quot;Night School&quot; on the platform increased by 980%year -on -year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上海市民夜校的“资深学员”任轶切身体会到此前从未有过的火热。 2018年前后，她偶然得知了市民夜校的存在，她的母亲原本想学手机摄影，去夜校报名才发现年龄限制在18-55岁之间，超过55岁的老年人有专门的“老年大学&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;任轶自此“入坑”，五年间，她把皮具班、钩针班、盘扣班挨个尝试了一遍。她说，那时的市民夜校不似如今这般火热，“基本守着（开放名额）的点就可以抢到”。 At that time, most of the night school courses were common projects such as calligraphy, painting, yoga, and vocal music.五年后，报名页面显得乱花迷眼，列表中不乏“宠物友好社交课程”“海派调饮茶”“十二月花神系列课程”等光看名字就能挑起兴趣的课程。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;年轻人加入夜校的目的很轻松，一位女生向南方周末记者解释意图：“社交，认识更多志同道合的人，或者你只是想新学一门技能，或者随便去看看，能学就学，不学就算了。都可以。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;火热的形势之下，任轶遭遇抢课滑铁卢，但最终交上了好运。在随时有人退课的动态系统中，她捡漏了一门盘扣课。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;涌入夜校“学艺”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;任轶偏爱手作类课程，此前在夜校上过皮具课和钩针班。 In the leather goods class, they start with a complete vegetable tanned leather as a starting point. After experiencing cutting, punching, and walking, they learn to sew card bags, key bags or golden bags. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年秋天的这节盘扣班，她手上拨弄的新对象，换成了盘扣——一种在传统服饰中固定衣襟的扣钮。课程在一个工作日的晚七点开始，历时一个半小时。她将长长的软扣条，盘成葫芦状、燕子状等各式各样的扣子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;时间一晃而过。 “每次到最后可能还做不完，但是人家打扫卫生的阿姨都急得要下班了，就赶我们。”任轶自认在班上属于手比较笨的学员，“但是我就是乐此不疲”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/s0wHEYsHW8aVjkdSRXynltS6wqLVnaKeTXMte0wY.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;在盘扣课上，学员们学习制作这种在传统服饰中固定衣襟的扣钮。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;卢尔煜是一名自由插画师，日常作息“凌晨睡，中午起”，每晚七点的夜校刚好卡在她一天中相对清醒的时刻。她报了茶艺课、花艺课和越剧班，分别在每周三、四、五的晚上七到八点半上课。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;卢尔煜说，茶艺课和花艺课显得“闲情逸致”，如果在外面花几千元去学，有点不太值当，不如拿这笔钱去学语言这样看上去更实用的知识。而夜校价格低廉，降低了她接触这类兴趣爱好的门槛。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/03eGV06UVYLt2pKNdY7VIfLPfX5r98BOaa2tR8VL.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;卢尔煜的茶艺课笔记。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以前想学这类课程，只能在网上搜索，搜索之后，也未必能鉴别出老师的水准高低，“可能会被骗”。报名前，卢尔煜留意过茶艺课老师的背景，“茶艺一级技师”“宋代点茶沿袭人”，资质可靠。市民夜校的老师经过了筛选，课程介绍清清楚楚地列明，省下了太多麻烦，“你可能会有想学的东西，但是一想到有繁琐的东西要去了解，不停地咨询这家那家，可能咨询下来后热情已经消磨完了”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她很喜欢茶艺课的氛围，十多个人，四五人一组。一帮人听老师讲茶的起源、红茶的冲泡方法。老师传授记住六类茶的口诀，“&#39;红绿灯（红茶、绿茶、黄茶）&#39;，再加&#39;黑白青&#39;”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/D62e0AYt7n8glJp50gV7sbZSWe51VFLHbahlhKQw.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;夜校的茶艺课相比市面上的培训课程价格更低廉，老师资质经过了专门筛选，对年轻人来说方便可靠。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;茶艺课上，老师带来不同品牌的矿泉水或纯净水，倒在透明杯子里，让大家蒙眼品尝不同水泡茶时的口感。检测pH值的用具能测出“有些水是7.37，有些8.08，还有一些6.26”。卢尔煜观察，水的pH值通常对口感影响不大，而水的硬度和矿物质含量则会带来两极评价。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在任轶上过的手作课上，最后一堂课通常是成果汇报，大家把一学期的成果摆出来展示。 “整个教室的长桌上都摆满了大家各种各样的作品，如果今天有一个夜市，我们整个班都可以拉出来练摊”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/tEhLHAOeGTtWR5hfmDhLLEzSBguexVra0BZxRBac.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/tEhLHAOeGTtWR5hfmDhLLEzSBguexVra0BZxRBac.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258776&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;手作课的各项成果。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;不是需要坚持的事&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“我报夜校无非出于几点考虑。第一，它很经济，同等质量、同等内容的课程，可能在市面上需要两三倍的价格。第二，它很有保障，风险比较低。它是上海市群众艺术馆办的项目，不像外面很多兴趣培训机构那样，受经济下行的影响就干不下去了，课程都没上完中间就跑路了，我的钱就打水漂了。”吉姆对南方周末记者说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她正式工作还没几年，在机关单位里上班，职业要求她保持“严肃、严谨的形象”，无论职业形象，还是自身行为，都有一定标准。但在非洲鼓课上，她不必那么紧绷。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;每天，吉姆骑自行车通勤，身后背着装有非洲鼓的背包，远看像背包客。实木的非洲鼓，重达五六斤。同事问她是不是准备出去玩，她从不解释，“我说我就是出去玩了”。下班后，她脱下职业装，换好便服，骑20分钟车到夜校，结束后再骑半小时车回家。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;教非洲鼓课的老师会多种乐器，比如尤克里里、中阮、吉他、键盘。 12节课程，前半程从基本的四分音符、八分音符学起，中间穿插节奏型的教学。如今课程过半，她正在为最新的作业头疼——老师要求大家自己编一首曲子。她观察，非洲鼓老师很注重培养她们的编曲能力，学成后能通过乐器传达生活感悟，而非仅仅照着谱子打出一段别人写的旋律。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“（非洲鼓）不是需要坚持的事，我没有觉得它很负担，是我上完班后放松的事。”吉姆说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;权衡了上课地点的远近、时间成本以及学习的迫切程度后，孙依然最终挑选了桥牌课。这是一种颇费脑力的棋牌类游戏，她一边听老师讲，一边在笔记本上记下牌型和规则。桥牌班的上课点离她家只有一站地铁。 “等于我去夜校就是早一站下地铁去上课，上完课再坐同一班地铁，一站到家”。同是夜校班的同学，有人住在浦东，下了班赶到离家更远的夜校上课，仅仅是因为感兴趣。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;孙依然觉得，一周一次的夜校，不会给自己带来太大的压力，“真有其他更重要的事，也完全有其他的时间处理”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她平时从事数据分析工作，按她的说法，就是将信息整理、分析、输出为“任谁看都是这样的”事实。 “工作不是一个纯理性状态，桥牌有完整的规则，明显的逻辑，其实都可以算出来的，你可以完全做一个AI机器人，可以算概率，对方可能出什么牌。”孙依然说，“我的工作虽然听起来像整理分析，但不是纯理性的，有很多人为因素参与决定，工作中我会觉得有些受束缚，但是桥牌没有。”她说，桥牌能带给她的乐趣正在于此。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一项多人参与的棋牌游戏，观察桥牌桌上玩家的不同风格也能带来乐趣。孙依然观察到，有人脑子灵光，上了牌场对各类牌型应对自如，但“胜负心很强”；有的人和她一样，对阵时需要不断翻看笔记，因此将牌局拉得很长；还有仅仅把对局当作一次游戏，倾向于让对手直接把牌说出来，大家一起想想怎么做。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/7mHrDYb4en1fFAVYlAQsX7bt7b8LYpiqGJ9uoXbe.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;桥牌课笔记。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;孙依然形容上夜校之前的工作日晚上，无聊、消磨时间。 “吃晚饭、健身、看看综艺也就过去了。看综艺或电影是没有头的，有时间就可以一直看，永远看不完。但如果我有别的事，也不会因为少看了两小时综艺而难过。”孙依然说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;夜校有出勤率考核，超过三次缺勤，就会失去下一季夜校的报名资格。 Many interviewees said that the night school courses are now more than half, and most of them have persisted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“现在年轻人的工作压力比以前大，需要更多的释放，找一些乐子。每个人找乐子的方式不一样。”孙依然说，“因为网络发达，大家更习惯于线上交流，线下的交流反而少了，多出来自己的时间变多了，所以大家可能就更想要出去玩，其中包括上夜校。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“每个礼拜都很有盼头”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;将上夜校纳入每周日程后，这些年轻人也感受到看似无用的业余生活给日常生活带来的改变。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据MBTI人格测试的结果，卢尔煜是一个“I人”。在“解放天性”的越剧班，大家要站起来演唱，还要压腿、跑圈。班上的同学两两配对，一个唱花旦，一个唱小生。越剧班里都是女孩，年龄不拘，70后到90后都有。前几节课，她们学《天上掉下个林妹妹》，卢尔煜选择扮“可以内向”一些的花旦。 “贾宝玉有些眼神戏，他说天上掉下个林妹妹，要表现出&#39;哇，这么漂亮&#39;，看到花旦很吃惊的感觉。有的同学会表现出特别浮夸的表情，老师也会被逗笑，你在这个环境里面也会被感染到。”她说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;放在过去，自认“宅女”的卢尔煜除了下楼扔垃圾，可以二十多天不出门。她说，“夜校其实相当于给自己强制一个出门时间，不要跟社会彻底脱节。因为不上班，又不去线下这些（社交活动），跟人群越来越远了，所以也是有点强制自己这三天出门的感觉。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;和同学们一起拍击非洲鼓，给吉姆留下一次难忘的体验。打鼓时，由于不熟悉曲谱，担心赶不上节奏，往往节奏会越来越快，这时只要有一个人意识到问题，可以慢下来，就会有越来越多人发现节奏快了，齐心拉回正常的轨道，“可能整体的节奏就会被拉回来”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;吉姆说，这和现在大家热衷谈论的“内卷”相反。 “内卷”有一个经典的具象比喻：在电影院里，前排有一个人站了起来，遮住后排的视线，于是越来越多人站起来，最终所有人只能站着看电影。而非洲鼓中的放慢步调则恰恰相反，“当时一瞬间发现还能这样，觉得很奇妙”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;再次回到教室，孙依然觉得夜校的氛围比起大学或中学时代好很多。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“高中以前基本上都是被逼着，只能学这些，不管你喜不喜欢。大学虽然是自己选的专业，但基本上每一堂课都有很大比例的人其实根本不想听。”她观察到，夜校的桥牌课堂里，很少有鸦雀无声的情形出现，老师的问题总能得到学生热情的回应。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，随着桥牌知识的深入，抱着学习新东西的心态来上课的孙依然，也感受到知识积累的压力。 “现在感觉到了一个临界点，做这件事情给我带来的快乐，和我为了把它做好要付出的努力差不多持平了。”她担心随着难度增加，桥牌也会变得有些压力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“这个名额是比较难抢的，你报了名，付出了金钱和时间，你又不好好实践，你还不如不去。”孙依然说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;报了皮具班的王一衣偶尔也感到焦虑。有一次，因为出差，皮具课要落下一节。 “我就觉得落一节课，会不会比别人少学点什么？”老师反过来劝慰她，回来会帮她把这节课补上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，王一衣总体上还是觉得，“每个礼拜都很有盼头”。 “能让你脱离工作，找一个新的寄托，每天白天已经被工作所累，晚上如果有一个新的内容，可以调剂一下生活。就会让你生活的重心不是一直在工作上，可以分一点心思给其他的东西。”她说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（除任轶、卢尔煜外，其余受访者皆为化名）&lt;/p>;
