Thirty generations of people are rushing one after another, rushing towards a new starting point - surprisingly, the new starting point is also the eternal end point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/aO56Nv9LO7BX4SFu59J6CyNdlMUphQaKAHH8vVRV.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;643&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/aO56Nv9LO7BX4SFu59J6CyNdlMUphQaKAHH8vVRV.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;131200&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Painted bronze chariots and horses in the Qin Shihuang Terracotta Warriors and Horses Museum&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC Photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt; h3>;Starting: Looking for the Meeting of Ganwei and West Inuqiu&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The afternoon sunshine is precious, especially in late autumn when the frost and wind are tight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Between the two mountains is a river and its alluvial valley. The river is clear and shallow, and the reed flowers look like snow. At the fork in the road, I asked two old men sunbathing for directions. Afterwards, the car passed through the village road and turned onto a rough dirt road. There are twists and turns, and on the other side of the mountain, withered yellow weeds dance in the wind, hiding countless pits and caves. Some pits also have red warning signs: Archaeological site, no entry allowed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What I saw was part of a tomb complex covering an area of ​​18 square kilometers. Just under these decaying weeds and trees, in the 1990s, archaeologists excavated 4 large tombs and 9 small and medium-sized tombs, as well as a large number of funerary objects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The owner of the tomb pointed to a tribe called Qin that was active in Longdong and Guanzhong more than 2,000 years ago. Their leader was the direct ancestor of Qin Shihuang, the later emperor of the ages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to &quot;Historical Records&quot;, the Qin people are descendants of Zhuan Xu. Among Zhuanxu&#39;s descendants, there was one named Dafei, also known as Boyi and Baiyi. Dafei lived during the eras of Shun and Yu. He first assisted Yu in water control, and then tamed birds and beasts for Shun. &quot;Many birds and beasts were tamed&quot;; so Shun gave him the surname Ying. This is the origin of Qin Shihuang&#39;s family name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fei Chang is a descendant of Da Fei and has superb royal skills. When Cheng Tang attacked Xia Jie, it was Fei Chang who drove the car. During the Shang generation, the Ying family was highly valued by the King of Shang. At the end of the Shang Dynasty, Feilian and his son Wei Lai &quot;both used their talents and abilities to serve the Yin Dynasty&quot;. After the fall of the Shang Dynasty, the Ying family, as a stubborn reactionary force of the Yin and Shang Dynasties, was moved by the King of Zhou to the western border area - mainly today&#39;s Tianshui and Longnan areas of Gansu Province. At that time, they lived together with the nomadic people called Rong or Xirong. The environment was harsh and their survival was difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the reign of King Mu of Zhou Dynasty, the Ying family gave birth to another man with superb royal skills, named Zaofu. Zaofu once drove to the west with King Mu, and when King Xu Yan rebelled, he accompanied King Mu to the east. Therefore, King Mu granted the city of Zhao to Zaofu. Zaofu took Zhao as his surname, which was the origin of the Zhao family. Qin and Zhao, who later fought endless wars, were actually brothers of the same clan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Qin Shihuang&#39;s family does not belong to the Cepheid branch - Qin Shihuang&#39;s family is the descendant of Erai, and Cepheus is the descendant of Erlai&#39;s brother Ji Sheng. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back on the past events of the Qin Kingdom, Feizi is a key figure that cannot be ignored. If the later Qin State was like a big tree with lush branches and leaves, then Feizi was the first root of this big tree. Because, starting from Feizi, Qin only existed in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feizi’s father is Da Luo. While the descendants of Zaofu from the same clan were in great turmoil in the Zhao region, Daluo was still trapped in Xiquanqiu (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;, also known as Xicui, today&#39;s Li County, Gansu&lt; /span>;), surrounded by Rong tribes, trying to survive in the cracks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like his ancestors who spent a lot of money, Feizi also &quot;good at horses and livestock, and good at raising them.&quot; At that time, horses were both an important source of power and an indispensable part of the chariot. For a country or tribe, the number of horses plays a decisive role. King Xiao of Zhou summoned Feizi to the meeting of Miwei to raise horses for the royal family. As a result, &quot;the horses have a good rest&quot; - the horses are fat and strong, and they give birth to many foals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For many years, scholars have debated endlessly about the location of the Miwei Society. Qian is the Mi River and Wei is the Wei River. Mihe River, also known as Qianhe River, is a tributary of Weihe River. The Meeting of Mi and Wei is also called between Mi and Wei. Therefore, this land with rich water and grass suitable for livestock grazing should be within the angle formed by Qianhe River and Wei River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lianhuo Expressway runs from east to west, parallel to the Wei River. After passing Guo Town, from the north bank of Weihe River to the south bank, the overpass led me to the Baoji Transit Expressway. 10 kilometers westbound, a bridge spans from east to west. The river surface is very narrow, but the river bed is extremely wide, spreading like a plain all the way to the distant green mountains. This is Qianhe. A few hundred meters south of the window on my left, Qianhe flows into the Weihe River. To the northwest outside the window on my right, the urban area with dense buildings and factories was Feizi&#39;s pasture more than two thousand years ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, a wetland park covering an area of ​​more than ten square kilometers has been built at the intersection of Qianhe River and Weihe River. Although the Qianhe and Weihe rivers I saw were both narrow and not rich in water, their wide river beds made people imagine that when the rainy season comes, they must be big and turbulent rivers. It was late autumn, and the grass and trees on the riverbed in the distance and on the mesa further away were still green, which seemed to imply that this was a good place for the growth of grass and trees, as well as cattle and horses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/ItLzMP5lAyMXgjyz32EEdUT72SVUf82KJZkX0Qmu.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/ItLzMP5lAyMXgjyz32EEdUT72SVUf82KJZkX0Qmu.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;131201&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Feizi Muma&#39;s meeting in Qianwei&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Nie Zuoping/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;Feizi&#39;s achievements in raising horses were richly rewarded: King Zhou Xiao planned to make him the heir to his father Da Luo. However, King Xiao&#39;s plan will definitely harm the interests of Feizi&#39;s half-brother Cheng Cheng, whose maternal grandfather was a very influential Marquis Shen in the Western Zhou Dynasty. Marquis Shen firmly objected, so King Xiao had to adopt a compromise approach - he said: In the past, he spent a lot of money to take charge of livestock for Shun, so Shun gave him the surname Ying. Now his descendants raise horses for me, and I divide the land into vassals. So, his reward to Feizi was: &quot;Qin in the city&quot;. That is to say, the land of Qin was granted to Feizi and he was named Qin Ying. The rank given to Feizi was vassal - the so-called vassal, whose title was lower than that of the prince Bo Zinan, and whose fiefdom did not exceed 50 miles. The prince was not qualified to directly meet the emperor and was attached to a certain prince. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although his status is insignificant - in comparison, Song is a duke, Qi and Jin are marquis, Zheng is an earl, and Chu is a viscount - when the princes met for an alliance, the king of Chu was too low in rank. He was not even qualified to enter the venue, and Feizi&#39;s level was even lower than Chuzi&#39;s. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, no matter how low the title is, it also means that Feizi, a member of the Ying clan, has not only obtained a formal title, but also has a hereditary territory; more importantly, from now on, the world has Qin and Qin people - the first Qin person was none other than Fei Zi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Where is the Qin that King Zhou Xiao conferred on Feizi? Historical data shows that it was in the Zhangjiachuan and Qingshui areas of Gansu Province. There are different opinions on the more specific location: it is believed to be in Qinting Township, Qingshui, and it is believed to be in Waquan Village, Zhangjiachuan. In fact, the two places are only twenty or thirty kilometers apart, so they may both be Feizi&#39;s fiefdoms. Not only that, but Mumatan in Maiji District, more than 80 kilometers to the south, is also considered Feizi&#39;s territory. More than two thousand years ago, this area was vast and sparsely populated. Feizi and his people drove herds of livestock and lived in pursuit of water and grass. Cattle and sheep multiplied, the population multiplied, and Ying Qin grew stronger step by step like a snowball. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xirong is the collective name given by the Huaxia people to other ethnic groups living in the northwest region during the pre-Qin period. Compared with the Huaxia people, Xirong is culturally backward, advocates force, is aggressive, and often conflicts with the Huaxia people. The ancestors of the Zhou Dynasty originally lived in Bin (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;today&#39;s Bin County and Xunyi area of ​​Shaanxi Province&lt;/span>;). Due to the long-term invasion by the Western Rong, they had to move east. Moved to Zhouyuan. Feizi&#39;s ancestors were originally moved to Xiquanqiu by the King of Zhou as a border guard. Their mission was: &quot;Be in Xirong and protect Xichui.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gui is a food vessel made of bronze and is often used together with a tripod. In 1980, a Gui with a missing cover was unearthed from a Western Zhou tomb in Tengzhou, Shandong. The inscription on the gui shows that its owner cannot call him, so he calls him &quot;not his gui&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The inscription on Buqi Gui tells the story of Buqi receiving the order from the King of Zhou and his relationship with the invading Yan Xun (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;i.e. The 烃狁 (a branch of the Rong) fought in Gaoling, winning three times in three battles, and was rewarded by the King of Zhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Who is it? He is Feizi&#39;s great-great-grandson Duke Zhuang of Qin. During the reign of Qin Zhong, the father of Duke Zhuang of Qin, the Xirong army attacked Xiquqiu, and the descendants of Feizi&#39;s brother Cheng were wiped out. The consequence of this incident was that the Feizi lineage, which was originally a branch of the Ying family, became the authentic sect of the Ying family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;King Xuan of Zhou appointed Qin Zhong as his official to attack Xirong. However, the isolated Qin people were no match for Xirong, and Qin Zhong died in the battle. After Qin Zhong&#39;s death, his five sons, including Bu Qi, were filled with grief and anger, and asked King Xuan of Zhou to send troops. King Xuan sent a team of 7,000 people, together with the Qin people, to defeat Xirong around 820 BC and regained Xiquqiu, which was occupied by Xirong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the war, King Xuan of Zhou appointed Duke Zhuang of Qin as the doctor of Xicui and gave him Xiquanqiu. As a result, the activity center of the Qin people for several generations since Feizi moved from today&#39;s Tianshui area to the Li County area in Longnan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dabaozi Mountain is more than ten kilometers away from Lixian County, and the Western Han River flows slowly between the two mountains. Many cultural relics unearthed here show that this is a long-standing Qin clan tomb. In fact, long before the country officially conducted archeology, many cultural relic dealers went to the Dabaozi Mountain area to rob tombs, and a large number of precious cultural relics flowed from here to all over the world. Bao Bao, a poet from Li County, told me that when he was a boy, farmers working in the fields often dug out some bronze utensils. Experts have determined that this is the Xicui Cemetery, one of the four major cemeteries of the Qin people. So, who is the most likely Qin Jun sleeping in Dabaozi Mountain? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/0STMPyplaX7gaKEdmtZJriuhSDe0SHGnvbLdtj1A.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/0STMPyplaX7gaKEdmtZJriuhSDe0SHGnvbLdtj1A.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;131202&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Qin Tombs in Dabaozi Mountain, Li County&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Nie Zuoping/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >; Various clues point to Qin Xianggong. In the history of the development of the Qin State, Qin Xianggong not only established the country by chance, but also led the Qin people out of Longnan and marched into Guanzhong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the reign of Duke Xiang of Qin, the Emperor of Zhou was the mediocre King You of Zhou. King You deposed the eldest son and established a young one. The prince&#39;s maternal grandfather Shenhou joined forces with the Western Rong to attack Zhou. King You was killed and Shenhou&#39;s grandson came to the throne as King Ping of Zhou. King Ping moved the capital from Haojing to Luoyi, and history moved from the Western Zhou Dynasty to the Eastern Zhou Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When King Ping moved eastward, Jin, Wei, Zheng and other countries formed a coalition to escort him, and Qin people with much different ranks also joined the coalition. Afterwards, King Ping rewarded Qin Xianggong for his merits and promoted Qin Xianggong to an earl. This ended the Qin people&#39;s vassal career and promoted them to princes. At that time, it had been more than 130 years since Feizi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If Qin Xianggong is likely to be buried in the Xicui Cemetery in Dabaozi Mountain, then where is the Xicui Palace built during the Zhuanggong period, the first &quot;capital&quot; of the Qin people? ? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the tradition of the Qin people that the distance between the capital and the mausoleum is mostly between 5 and 15 kilometers, Xicui Palace is located near Dabaozi Mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of landform and environment, it is quite ingenious to choose the &quot;capital&quot; here: in the Dabaozi Mountain area, the Xihe River and the Xihan River meet, forming a fertile small basin. Dabaozi Mountain, with its steep western slope and gentle eastern slope, dominates it to the west. Yanguan, which is rich in salt, guards its east. Qishan Fort, which was once rated as one of the three major fortresses in the country by Emperor Wei Wen, controls it. More than 2,000 years ago, the climate here was warm and humid, with abundant rainfall and heat, suitable for farming and animal husbandry, and the products were abundant. The unique salt industry resources, coupled with the martial spirit of the Qin people tempered by years of battles and killings, although the population of the Qin people is still small, in hundreds of years, it will develop and grow bit by bit, and split into a world that is frightening. The Tiger and Wolf Qin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/yvIZFzFW3VigSBJZMrimO63Lgwy1ZLxqXAUkGYJP.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/yvIZFzFW3VigSBJZMrimO63Lgwy1ZLxqXAUkGYJP.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;131203&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Village at the foot of Dabaozi Mountain&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Nie Zuoping/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Inheritance: Loess Pingyang and Yongcheng under the Emperor&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;In 238 BC, Ying Zheng entered his 10th year of succession to the throne. In April of this year, he held a coronation ceremony, which meant that he began to rule personally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Surprisingly, the ceremony was not held in Xianyang, the capital of Qin, but in Yongcheng, 150 kilometers west of Xianyang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the young Ying Zheng, Yongcheng not only built a palace, but also buried many of his ancestors. It was of great significance in the history of Qin State to carry forward the past and open up the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The story has to start with King Ping of Zhou. In addition to making Qin a vassal, King Ping also wrote a blank check to the Qin people: he gave the Qin and Feng lands that had been occupied by the Xirong - roughly equivalent to today&#39;s Baoji, Shaanxi to Tianshui, Gansu - to the Qin people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After many years of bloody battles between Qin Xianggong and his son Qin Wengong, when Duke Wen of Qin arrived, the bad check was actually cashed: the Qin people took the land of Qifeng into their hands. Including the Miweihui, where Feizi used to herd horses for the King of Zhou, also returned to the Qin people after being lost for hundreds of years. Among them, the war against the Rong launched by Duke Wen in 750 BC &quot;collected the remaining Zhou people&quot; - after King Ping moved eastward, a large number of Zhou people remained in the Qifeng area. The Qin State not only occupied the land of Qifeng, but also Turn these Zhou people into Qin people. This also means that the Qin people have since entered the fertile Guanzhong Plain, and the center of gravity of rule has shifted from Longnan to central Shaanxi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qin Wengong, who has enjoyed the country for 50 years, is a powerful character. When he conquered Rongdong and entered the outside world, he had two major events worthy of note: one was the establishment of historians, and the history of Qin State has been recorded in writing; the other was the establishment of crimes against three tribes and torture. The later Qin State was famous for its harsh punishments, and the instigator was Duke Wen of Qin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Qin Wen Gong expanded eastward and stationed himself at Ma Miwei, he had to wait until his son Qin Xiangong to move the capital from Xiquanqiu to Pingyang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Near the Guozhen East Interchange of Lianhuo Expressway, about ten kilometers west of Qianweizhihui Wetland Park, fields and factories are mixed, and residential buildings and factories are intertwined. It is a typical urban-rural junction. In 1981, a batch of pre-Qin cultural relics were unearthed in this small place called Taigong Temple. Among them, the text on one clock indicates that the owner of the cultural relic is Qin Wugong. Correspondingly, a number of pre-Qin tombs have been discovered in the villages surrounding Taigong Temple. Based on this, some scholars believe that Pingyang, one of the capitals of the Qin State, is located in this area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/ble5aQijKbxbWmMx1IEtv0cvtDc1BvuLImM1CMds.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;617&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/ble5aQijKbxbWmMx1IEtv0cvtDc1BvuLImM1CMds.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;131204&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Location map of the four capitals of Qin&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Feng Qingchao/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qin Wu Just as his posthumous title suggests, Gong Gong: &quot;Being strong and straightforward is called martial arts, and punishing the people and overcoming them is called martial arts.&quot; Externally, he insisted on using troops to fight against the Western Rong; internally, he killed his three fathers and other powerful ministers to destroy the three tribes. In addition, he was also the first monarch in Qin to practice human sacrifice. After his death, the number of deceased persons reached 66. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it was another initiative of Qin Wugong that really had a significant impact on Qin and later China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the tenth year of Qin Wugong (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;688 BC&lt;/span>;), the Qin State captured the Kweichow (邽) from Xirong. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Now Qingshui, Gansu&lt;/span>;), Ji (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Today After the two places in Gansu (Gangu), instead of treating the gains from the expansion of territory as noble fiefs as in the past, they were established as counties and were managed by officials directly sent by the king. From the pre-Qin Dynasty to the present day, for more than two thousand years, counties have been the basic unit of administrative divisions in each era, and the right to invent them belonged to Qin Wugong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the capital of Qin, Pingyang only experienced two generations of monarchs, Xian Gong and Wu Gong. After Wu Gong&#39;s younger brother De Gong came to the throne, he moved the Qin capital from Pingyang to Yongcheng, more than 20 kilometers northwest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/oUEdvSprfqESr8OcmtwAxu9TEwNIeBC9T1PScSIv.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;635&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/oUEdvSprfqESr8OcmtwAxu9TEwNIeBC9T1PScSIv.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;131205&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Fengxiang East Lake, built for Su Dongpo&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC Photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On December 16, 1061, Su Dongpo, who had just arrived in Fengxiang for two days to take office as the judge, couldn&#39;t wait to rush to the Confucius Temple to see the long-famous stone drum. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The stone drum has 10 sides in total, each side is nearly 3 feet high and weighs a thousand kilograms. Today, more than 900 years later, they have gone through many twists and turns and are collected in the Palace Museum. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Each side of the stone drum is engraved with ancient inscriptions, which are called stone drum inscriptions. The owners of the stone drums each have different opinions: Qin Wengong, Qin Xuangong, Qin Mu Gong, Qin Xianggong, Qin Xiangong - no matter which Qin Gong, in short, they are all works of Qin people. The stone drum was unearthed in the south of Fengxiang City. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The texts on the stone drums may tell about Qin Gong’s hunting or crossing a river, or describe the beauty and majesty of Qin’s mountains and rivers, or praise the bravery and prowess of Qin’s soldiers - just like pictures of Qin people more than 2,000 years ago. Ukiyo-e. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fengxiang is Yongcheng. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 677 BC to Duke Xiang of Qin in 677 BC, and 294 years after Qin established its capital Yongcheng, 19 monarchs passed down the throne here from generation to generation. In the past 300 years, the Qin people left countless ruins and relics on the land of Yongcheng. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, Fengxiang is a small city located in the Guanzhong Plain. Leaving the city, the wheat fields are green. In the wilderness five or six kilometers south of the city is the location of the sensational Qin Gong No. 1 Tomb. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon when I went to Qin Gong No. 1 Tomb, there was no one else except the staff guarding the gate. The garden was empty and quiet. Although I have visited a considerable number of ancient tombs, I was still surprised by the grandeur of Qin Gong No. 1 Tomb: the plane of the tomb is in the shape of a Chinese character, the vertical axis of the Chinese character is the east-west slope tomb passage, and the entrance in the middle is the tomb chamber. The entire tomb is 300 meters long, with the tomb chamber nearly 40 meters wide and 25 meters deep. There are three steps left from the construction on the four walls of the tomb, making the entire tomb look like an inverted pyramid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the data, Qin Gong No. 1 Tomb has the largest scale and the most victims excavated so far (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;186 The top five in Chinese archeology, including the highest level of human beings and tomb tools. Although the tomb has been robbed more than 200 times since the Han and Tang Dynasties, more than 3,500 cultural relics have been unearthed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/QCBzXSqJSYFFLbHdW5qpe0lv9Z3r9VmtFmgQqtR9.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/QCBzXSqJSYFFLbHdW5qpe0lv9Z3r9VmtFmgQqtR9.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;131206&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Yongcheng Qin Jinggong Cemetery Tomb&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Nie Zuoping/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The tombs Who is the master? According to the text on the excavated stone chime, it is inferred that he should be Qin Jinggong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of seniority, Qin Jinggong was the fourteenth generation ancestor of Qin Shihuang and the fourth generation grandson of Qin Mu Gong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is an idiom called Qin and Jin Zhihao, which generally refers to the marriage between two families. The allusion comes from Duke Mu of Qin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second monarch after Qin moved its capital to Yongcheng was Qin Xuangong, the eldest son of Qin Degong. At that time, Qin had already gained the upper hand in the war against Xirong. The next step was how to develop eastward and compete with the princes for the world. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The State of Qin is located on the northwest border. If it wants to develop eastward, the first enemy it must defeat is the State of Jin in the east of the country, which blocks Qin&#39;s road to the Central Plains. However, Jin was a powerful country with great strength. During the reign of Duke Xuan of Qin, Qin and Jin fought for the first time, and Qin won, but it was of no use. When Duke Mu of Qin arrived, Duke Mu changed his national policy, proposed to the state of Jin, and married the daughter of Duke Xian of Jin. After that, he supported the exiled prince Chong&#39;er of the Jin Kingdom, helped him become the king of Jin, and married his daughter to him. In terms of relatives, Duke Mu was previously Chong&#39;er&#39;s brother-in-law, and later became Chong&#39;er&#39;s father-in-law. Chong&#39;er was Duke Wen of Jin, one of the Five Hegemons of the Spring and Autumn Period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the death of Duke Wen of Jin, the relationship between Qin and Jin broke down and the two sides fell into a long-term war. Although Qin once captured Duke Hui of Jin, Qin&#39;s eastward expansion was still curbed by Jin. The only significant result was that Duke Hui of Jin ceded the land of Hexi to Qin in order to repay Duke Mu of Qin for not killing him. The Qin State pushed its forces to the west bank of the Yellow River for the first time, and the Qin people also saw the turbulent Yellow River for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qin Mugong realized that the Qin State could not completely defeat the Jin State, so he turned to launch an offensive against Xirong in the present-day western Gansu, northern Shaanxi, and Ningxia areas: &quot;The twelve benefited the country, opened thousands of miles of land, and then dominated Xirong&quot;. Duke Mu of Qin became one of the Five Hegemons of the Spring and Autumn Period after his brother-in-law and son-in-law Duke Wen of Jin. At that time, the territory of the Qin State roughly extended to the Yellow River in the east, to the west of Longshan Mountain in the west, to the present-day Pingliang and Yan&#39;an areas in the north, and to the Qinling Mountains in the south. It covered an area of ​​nearly 100,000 square kilometers, which was equivalent to that of the Jin State. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/2mrLbecwzDL45lt1h5nPxWtb7GNltAD33GvPCVjC.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/2mrLbecwzDL45lt1h5nPxWtb7GNltAD33GvPCVjC.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;131207&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Babaili Qinchuan&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC Photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Empress Mu Gong , Kang Gong, Gong Gong and Huan Gong who were re-elected successively fought with Jin more than ten times, winning more than losing. Although victory or defeat is a common matter for military strategists, Qin often broke its promises in international relations, leaving a deep and bad impression on the princes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jingyang is located to the north of Xi&#39;an, and the county seat is on the north bank of Jingshui River. Two years ago, when I went to Jingyang to visit the origin of the earth in China, I planned to visit the site of the Battle of Ma Tunnel, which had affected the fate of the Qin State for many years. However, after consulting local chronicles and asking local people, we were unable to do so - the records in the history books were too vague: Ma Tun, north of Jingyang County. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Zhou Wen&quot; in &quot;Gu Wen Guan Zhi&quot; contains an article &quot;Lü Xiang Jue Qin&quot;. This article is related to the Battle of Ma Tun: In 577 BC, the Jin State sent Lu Xiang to defeat Qin. Envoy to the State of Qin, he recounted how the three generations of Qin Duke Mu, Kang Gong, and Gong Gong repeatedly betrayed their alliances, provoked wars, and declared war on the Qin State. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, the Jin State took the lead in forming a nine-nation coalition including Jin, Qi, Song, Wei, Lu, etc., which went deep into the Qin territory from east to west and fought fiercely at the Ma Tunnel. The Qin army was defeated, and the allied forces crossed the Jinghe River and pursued Hou Li (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;today&#39;s territory of Jingyang&lt;/span>;) before returning home in triumph. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Battle of Ma Tun was one of the few disastrous defeats in the history of the Qin people. The land in Hexi obtained by Qin Mugong was taken away by the Jin State (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;The three families were divided into Jin and then returned to Wei&lt;/span>;). Without the natural protection of the Yellow River, Qin&#39;s territory retreated significantly to the west, and the Qin people&#39;s ideal of eastward expansion encountered a head-on blow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qin Jinggong, who was sleeping deep in the loess of Tomb No. 1, ascended the throne against the background of losing troops and losing ground in the Battle of Ma Tunnel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qin Jinggong must have felt that Qin was extremely isolated internationally. In order to reverse this situation, he adopted the method of forming an alliance with the Chu State - fundamentally speaking, the Chu people were also descendants of Zhuan Xu and were related by blood to both Qin and Zhao. More importantly, Chu was a viscount, lower than Qin at that time, and had always been regarded as a barbarian by the princes of the Central Plains. The two countries, which were both despised by the princes, hit it off and formed the Qin-Chu Alliance to deal with the Jin-Qi Alliance headed by Jin Qi. Many small countries can only walk a tightrope between the two major alliances - of course, more of them are attached to the Jin-Qi Alliance than to the Qin-Chu Alliance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eighteen years after the Battle of Ma Tun, under the leadership of Jin, the princes once again formed a coalition to attack Qin - this time as many as 13 countries. Faced with the threat of a large army, Qin Jinggong adopted the first &quot;chemical warfare&quot; documented in history: when the coalition forces were stationed on the banks of the Jing River, he poisoned the upper reaches. A large number of coalition soldiers were poisoned and died, and they had to withdraw from the Qin territory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 31st year of Qin Jinggong&#39;s appointment as king, the Song Dynasty official Xiang Xu launched a peace movement, which is known in history as Xiang Xu&#39;s annihilation of troops: 14 countries, including Qin and Jin, formed an alliance, stopped the war, and ordered Jin and Chu is the co-overlord. Although Qin and Qi did not aspire to be the hegemons, they were listed as the four great powers along with Jin and Chu. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Repost: Liyang City’s Shocking Reform&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;I found a black stone tablet inscribed with “Liyang City Ruins” at the end of a cornfield beside the road. Above the stone tablet, there is Two crooked electric poles and cables hanging down randomly, like vines that are gradually withering in autumn. At that time, the rain was pouring, and the wilderness far and near was vast. What I recall in my mind is an incredible scene that happened here more than two thousand years ago:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 359 BC, the government erected a 3-foot-long wooden stick at the south gate of Yueyang City. And announced: Whoever carries the stick from the south gate to the north gate will be rewarded 10 gold. Such a short journey, such a light job, such a high salary? The onlookers talked a lot, but no one took the initiative. After a while, the price was increased again: 50 gold. After a long time, someone finally carried the stick to the north gate with the attitude of giving it a try - and sure enough he got 50 gold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This allusion is the famous Yimu Lixin. With the strong support of Duke Xiao of Qin, the reform movement presided over by Shang Yang kicked off in Yueyang, the capital of Qin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/5BpJ7BzTnWGn09ctS1AvIHP1Gz6nFSANYiA9mYKt.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;539&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/5BpJ7BzTnWGn09ctS1AvIHP1Gz6nFSANYiA9mYKt.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;131208&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;At the end of 2020, at the Qin and Han Dynasty Yueyang City ruins in Yanliang, Xi&#39;an, archaeologists excavated for the first time a large-scale harem living area in the Qin State palace city ruins in the middle Warring States Period. . &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC Photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nearly all the ten generations of Qin kings after Jinggong did not make great achievements, and at most they were regarded as conservative kings. . It was not until the era of Qin Xiangong that Qin ushered in a new rise. Qin Jinggong was the thirteenth generation Qin Jun, and Qin Xiangong was the twenty-fourth generation Qin Jun. There were two full centuries between them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the second year after Qin Xiangong came to the throne, he moved the capital to Yueyang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liyang is in Yanliang District, northeast of Xi&#39;an today. Geographically speaking, it is located to the north of the Wei River and is the only place that leads from the Guanzhong Plain to the Three Jin Dynasties. It has prosperous commerce and is densely populated. Sima Qian said that it &quot;connects to the three Jin Dynasties in the east and has many merchants&quot; - which seems to be a proof of the commercial prosperity of Liyang. A few years after moving the capital to Liyang, Qin Xiangong &quot;initially acted as a market&quot; - the market was opened in an official form for the first time. Encourage industry and commerce and collect business taxes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While developing the economy, Qin Xiangong strengthened his control over the grassroots. On the one hand, he further implemented the county system, and on the other hand, he organized the country&#39;s population into one group for every five families, requiring the people to supervise each other and implement joint sitting. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 21st year of Duke Xian of Qin (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;364 BC&lt;/span>;), the Qin army crossed the Yellow River eastward and penetrated deeply into the Kingdom of Wei ( &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the 5th century BC, the three families were divided into the Jin Dynasty, and the Jin Kingdom was divided into the three kingdoms of Wei, Zhao and Han&lt;/span>;). The Wei army was defeated at Shimen and beheaded. 60000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liyang has been the capital of Qin for only more than thirty years, with a generation and a half of kings - Duke Xiang of Qin and his son Duke Xiao of Qin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the history of the rise of the Qin State, Qin Xiaogong was a key figure of great importance. Jia Yi said: &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Qin Xiaogong held the land of Weihan and held the land of Yongzhou. The monarchs and ministers stood firm to get a glimpse of the Zhou Dynasty. He swept the world and included the whole country. , encompassing the meaning of the four seas and the heart of the eight wastelands.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qin Xiaogong had a spirit of introspection. He realized that the Qin State was remote in the northwest and had no say in the world. The state of Qin was not even qualified to participate. &quot;The princes despise Qin, and there is nothing more ugly than that.&quot; So, he ordered to seek talents; so Shang Yang came to Qin and launched a series of reforms that changed history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sima Qian summarized the content of Shang Yang&#39;s reform in one sentence: &quot;Reform laws and amend punishments, cultivate crops at home, and encourage rewards and punishments for dying in war.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, Shang Yang&#39;s reform The most important thing is two words: agricultural war. Farming is agriculture, war is military. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shang Yang’s success lies in his grasping the core of the problem, which is that Qin Xiaogong hopes to use simple, easy-to-operate, and quick-effective methods to create a vibrant Qin State like a magician. . Focusing on agriculture guarantees the economy; focusing on military affairs is the hardest principle in an era where the law of the jungle is respected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, synchronizing with the reform and modification of punishments was the harsh system of joint sitting and informing - this was continuously strengthened by several generations of Qin monarchs; synchronizing with the emphasis on agriculture was the attack on businessmen. That is, focusing on agriculture and suppressing commerce. Not only merchants must be severely punished, but even the occasional commercial activities of the people are strictly prohibited; &quot;rewards and punishments of death for foreigners to persuade others to fight&quot; certainly made the Qin army braver, but the Qin State gradually degenerated into a bloodthirsty &quot;shangshou&quot; A country with &quot;great merit&quot;: the Qin army has one camp commander for every five people and one general for every one hundred people. During the war, all generals and commanders would be executed if they did not capture the enemy&#39;s head. If 33 heads are obtained and the standard is met, the generals and commanders will be promoted to the first level. When besieging an enemy city, capture more than 8,000 heads and meet the standard; capture more than 2,000 heads in the field and meet the standard; generals at all levels can receive rewards. The Qin army, which relies on its title to motivate and stimulate, is obviously not something the princes can resist with its crazy bloodthirst. Civilization lost to barbarism because barbarism can defy human morality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From today&#39;s perspective, Shang Yang&#39;s reforms can certainly make a country rich and powerful in the short term, but if it is adopted as a long-term national policy, it is destined to lead the country to disaster. For example, if you want to temporarily save a seriously ill patient&#39;s life, you can use strong medicine; but if you use strong medicine for a long time, it will not only fail to cure the disease, but will kill him. ——In the era of Qin Shihuang, the basic national policy of that year was still implemented. It enabled Qin to finally unify the world, but it failed to prevent the Qin Dynasty from escaping the short-lived cycle of rapid prosperity and sudden collapse. The reason is that Shang Yang&#39;s reform was too strong a medicine. A normal country could not withstand such a strong medicine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the death of Duke Xiao, Shang Yang was liquidated by the nobles of the Qin State and sentenced to death by being broken into pieces. However, the laws formulated by him were still faithfully implemented in the Qin State. Han Feizi said: &quot;Shang Yang died, but Qin Fa was not defeated.&quot; Indeed, although Shang Yang himself died tragically, the new laws he formulated back then were still followed in the Qin State and laid a solid foundation for Qin Shihuang to unify China. In fact, not only did Shang Yang&#39;s new laws survive in the Qin State, but Shang Yang&#39;s shadow can also be seen at any time in other eras in the history of old China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is thought-provoking is that the rise of Qin not only failed to improve Qin’s international image, but made it even worse: before Shang Yang’s reform, Qin was regarded as a barbarian by the princes because of its remoteness, isolation and backward culture. After Shang Yang&#39;s reform, the country of Yi and Di was not only looked down upon but also reputed to be greedy for profit, dishonest, violent and brutal. The princes called it the violent Qin or the Qin of tigers and wolves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The monarchs and ministers of the Qin State, who were dedicated to becoming bigger and stronger, disdained these noisy voices. At this time, the Qin State was like a chariot that had started and was rumbling towards the battlefield. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Together: six kings, one in the world&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;While Shang Yang was carrying out vigorous reforms in Yueyang, he was also building another city in the heart of the Guanzhong Plain, two hundred miles southwest of Yueyang. That will be the future capital of the Qin State, and it will also be the end point of the Qin State and the Qin Dynasty that was upgraded from the Qin State - Xianyang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is an overpass on the Xi&#39;an Ring Expressway called Afang Palace, and inside it is the ruins of Afang Palace. An &quot;Ode to Afang Palace&quot; written by Du Mu of the Tang Dynasty made this palace of the Qin Dynasty, which had been in disintegration for many years, famous and became almost synonymous with the Qin Dynasty and its capital Xianyang. However, in essence, Afang Palace was built in the 35th year of Qin Shihuang. Only two years later, Qin Shihuang died on the East Patrol Road. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moved from Yueyang to Xianyang, the capital and palace of Qin were built more than 20 miles away from the later Epang Palace - one of them was north of the Wei River and the other was south of the Wei River. Regarding Weibei, it was probably Du Fu&#39;s saying &quot;Spring trees in Weibei, sunset clouds in the east of the Yangtze&quot; that left a good impression on me. Therefore, when I saw the falling poplar leaves in Weibei in late autumn, I was a little disappointed. . The Qindu ruins in Xianyang are located on a vast loess plateau, high up and far away. The palaces of two thousand years ago have been turned into cultivated land and woods. There are occasionally some abrupt terraces, which are probably the foundations of the palaces back then.台基下的黄土沟里，点缀着一些民居，几只羊在房前屋后的草丛中低头啃食，人间的沧海桑田不是这些可怜的牲口能够理解的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为秦国都城，自秦孝公至秦始皇，七代秦君在咸阳运筹帷幄，经过多年浴血奋战，终于九九归一；作为秦朝都城，自秦始皇至秦二世，仅仅十多年就一片瓦砾。秦始皇设想的是由始皇而二世而三世乃至千世万世，然而，理想很丰满，现实很骨感：从非子邑之秦到秦始皇统一中国，打天下耗费了嬴氏家族600多年，坐天下却只有区区14年。 600年的崛起与14年的崩溃，其原因，古人早就总结得十分透彻：“仁义不施而攻守之势异也。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;秦孝公将首都从栎阳迁往咸阳，最大因素在于咸阳地处秦国中心位置，且临近渭河，交通便利——顺着渭河，秦国的军队和物资可以进入黄河，从而向东征伐。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;迁都咸阳10年后，通过变法而兵强马壮的秦国磨刀霍霍。这一年，趁世仇魏国刚被齐国吊打，商鞅亲率大军渡河攻魏，并利用他与魏军主将之一公子卬的旧交，以会盟为名将其诱擒，大破魏军，收复了失去多年的河西之地，实现了秦孝公即位之初“复穆公之故地”的理想。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;秦孝公后，惠文王、武王、昭襄王、孝文王和庄襄王五任秦君次第登场，继续蚕食诸侯。其中，尤以惠文王和昭襄王为最：惠文王时，向东攻魏国，占领河西、上郡，黄河天险与崤函要塞牢牢控于秦人之手；向西南，灭巴国和蜀国；向西北，夺取义渠25城。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;昭襄王在位58年，是秦国享国最久的君主。他先后发动数十次征伐，其麾下战神白起仅仅四场战争就消灭诸侯军队100万以上——当时全天下的总人口，估计也不过2000万。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了对付秦国，诸侯以合纵为名组织了4次或5次联军，然而，正如贾谊说的那样：&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;“秦人开关延敌，九国之师，逡巡而不敢进。秦无亡矢遗镞之费，而天下诸侯已困矣。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/73oVHZiw76YNjTGCGgOBov7SXuO9V4FiLZLf1PTp.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;当嬴政成为新一代秦君时，还是一个13岁的青涩少年，大权掌握在吕不韦手中。公元前238年，23岁的嬴政来到雍城，举行加冕典礼。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上世纪80年代，考古工作者在凤翔县长青乡发现一处战国建筑遗迹，其中一块瓦当上有四个字：蕲年宫当。 “蕲”通“祈”，祈年，就是向上天祈求丰年。史料载，蕲年宫系穆公修建，嬴政的加冕礼便在这里举行——比加冕礼更重要的是，嬴政坐镇雍城，平定了在咸阳作乱的嫪毐。次年，赐死吕不韦，从此大权独揽，政令悉由己出。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;自公元前230年开始，秦国以摧枯拉朽之势发动了统一之战：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前230年，灭韩；&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前229年，灭赵；&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前225年，灭魏；&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前224年，灭楚；&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前222年，灭燕、代；&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前221年，灭齐。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;至此，九州肃清，海内混一。灼人的硝烟中，大秦王国升级为大秦帝国，秦王嬴政升级为秦始皇，一个疆域远迈前代的大一统帝国首次出现在中国。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;还需要指出的是，该警车的行为涉嫌交通肇事逃逸。根据《道路交通事故处理程序规定》第一百一十二条：“交通肇事逃逸”是指发生道路交通事故后，当事人为逃避法律责任，驾驶或者遗弃车辆逃离道路交通事故现场以及潜逃藏匿的行为。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;今年8月31日，云南省洱源县一辆法院警车发生交通事故后离去，事件曝光后引发网友热议。据洱源县法院情况通报，该院司法警察李某樑等三人当日前往洱源县拘留所执行公务，与一辆货车在会车过程中发生侧面刮擦，造成两车不同程度受损。洱源县公安局交警大队作出《道路交通事故认定书》《公安交通管理行政处罚决定书》，认定李某樑负事故全部责任，对李某樑交通事故后逃逸、尚不构成犯罪的违法行为给予罚款1000元、驾驶证记6分的行政处罚。法院已对李某樑进行批评教育，责令其深刻检讨，并将按照相关规定对其作出处理。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;丰城市警车撞人后离去，其行为是否属于交通肇事逃逸？当事警车匆匆离去，是否因牵涉酒驾醉驾？丰城市交警部门对此进行了哪些调查，对警车所负责任做了哪些处理？从丰城市交警部门的回应中，我们没有看到这些信息。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而该事件的第二个疑点是，交通事故发生于9月14日，但交通责任事故认定书26日才出具。 《道路交通事故处理程序规定》第六十二条规定：公安机关交通管理部门应当自现场调查之日起十日内制作道路交通事故认定书。对需要进行检验、鉴定的，应当在检验报告、鉴定意见确定之日起五日内制作道路交通事故认定书。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从以上规定来看，如果涉及检验、鉴定等，由于其需要一定时限，因此道路交通事故认定书可能会延后出具。那么，该起事故是否涉及检验、鉴定，丰城市交警部门应具体说明。如果并不涉及以上事项，为何迟至网友曝光后才出具交通事故责任认定书？丰城市交警部门没有依规按期出具交通事故认定书，也难怪众多网友对其质疑，甚至有网友称，是不是肇事警车涉及“领导”，导致事故责任认定迟迟无法出炉？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;请不要怪众网友的联想丰富，对于“警车撞伤人后直接离去”一事，当地交警部门处理结果的种种缺失，与常识与法理不符，与公众对此事所期待的信息公开、处理公正也有明显差距。现场“走佬”的警车、姗姗来迟的交通事故认定书，不应就此成谜。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;毕竟，近年来交通事故中当事一方自诩“有背景”、干扰交警部门处理的事件屡屡发生。越是涉及“自家人”，公众对此类交通事故的审视越严格，也期待交警部门秉公执法，处理结果经得起法律和民意检验。当地交警部门应就网友们所关注的以上疑点，尽快予以回应。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 21, 2023 local time, at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the United States, Prime Minister of Nepal Rachanda delivered a speech at the 78th session of the United Nations General Assembly. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From September 23 to 30, 2023, Nepalese Prime Minister Prachanda paid an official visit to China . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is Prachanda’s view on Nepal’s diplomacy, neighboring relations and the entire world situation? What is the connotation of the &quot;New Nepal&quot; vision proposed by Prachanda? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The answers to the above questions will be helpful for a comprehensive understanding of Prachanda’s ideological and political process in the past ten years, as well as the possible future political direction of Nepal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, the &quot;Selected Speeches of Prime Minister Prachanda of Nepal&quot; edited and translated by the South Asia Institute of Sichuan University, a key research base of the Ministry of Education, will be published soon. The book includes Prachanda&#39;s speeches in 2015 —25 speeches in the past ten years of his political career in 2023, answering the above questions. Most of the speeches included in the anthology cover Prachanda&#39;s speeches in the Nepali Parliament. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not only a commemoration of Prachanda’s visit to China, but also a testimony to the vigorous development of China-Nepal friendly relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Historical Transformations&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;What kind of Nepal does Prachanda want to build? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Prachanda has repeatedly praised the success of the Nepalese people in their movement against the autocratic monarchy. He defined this shift as &quot;the largest shift in history&quot; &quot;heralding the last shift in a new era of peace, stability and prosperity&quot; and &quot;building history according to the needs of history.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a decade of civil war, Prachanda wants Nepal to go (or run) on the track of economic development and construction, hoping to end an era of chaos and poverty. His desire for development and prosperity made him a visionary leader. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When we stand at the crossroads of history and look back on the past, it is easy for us to be confused: whether Nepal has truly benefited from these historical achievements. For this reason, as the core political figure of this period, Prime Minister Prachanda has also been questioned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why has Nepal still not achieved the stability and prosperity it promised? Why are economic and social plans not implemented effectively? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some articles raised questions about Prime Minister Prachanda&#39;s previous commitments and vision. Because even after taking office several times, these promises and visions have not all been implemented. However, from the articles in this book that span a relatively long time, we may be able to see its original intention, practical helplessness, and future ambitions and plans. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Self-evident strategic position&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The geopolitical landscape of South Asia is changing. As the largest economy in the region, India adheres to the &quot;Monroe Doctrine&quot; and always tends to be brothers with its surrounding small economies. India regards South Asia as its own backyard, and no other country can get involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, as China is growing into a powerful country with widespread influence around the world, India is unable to compete with it and cannot continue to adhere to its policy stance in South Asia. Therefore, India agrees to the US presence in South Asia, which is imperative for the US to advance its long-term strategy of containing China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this context, Nepal&#39;s foreign policy is largely affected by the changing international situation. The United States very much wants Nepal to be part of its strategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1970s, the United States used Nepal to create border problems. Today, the United States is dictating to Nepal at all costs to force it to pass the Millennium Challenge Plan. U.S. officials came one after another to put pressure on Nepali leaders in Kathmandu and once again asked them to adopt the Military Operations Charter. From the implementation level of the US &quot;Indo-Pacific Strategy&quot;, a crucial point is to firmly control Nepal. The &quot;Millennium Challenge Plan&quot; and subsequent military plans are undoubtedly part of the United States&#39; &quot;Indo-Pacific Strategy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Modi government gave up its status as a founding member of the &quot;Non-Aligned Movement&quot; and joined the Western Alliance led by the United States. The situation in South Asia has changed. Therefore, even in Nepal, which advocates independence, the direction of diplomacy has been forced to change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, the United States mainly relied on India, or at least coordinated with Nepal and India in terms of policy. Today, the dominant position of the United States is very prominent and India&#39;s role has been weakened. This situation has deepened the contradictions and confusion among Nepali leadership. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although &quot;balanced foreign policy&quot; is the declared position of most Nepali leaders, they also tend to get stuck in the quagmire of great power politics. In this case, some of them are complacent about being included in the alliance backed by India and led by the United States. Therefore, the geopolitical competition between Nepal and South Asia is no longer just regional, but an important part of global geopolitics. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Balanced Diplomacy&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Maintaining diplomatic balance is the primary condition for Nepal&#39;s political stability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A series of diplomatic speeches made by Prachanda during his tenure as Prime Minister also mainly focused on trilateral cooperation with China and India. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the Shah dynasty (not just the Malla dynasty), Nepal has maintained a balanced relationship between its two giant neighbors, and it can maintain it as long as it maintains friendly relations with China and India. Safe and powerful. But sometimes, the different civilizations, different political systems, and different diplomatic positionings of the two neighboring countries can push Nepal into an uneasy situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tensions in Sino-Indian relations will put Nepal on the edge of vulnerability. It is important for Nepali politicians to master the art of maintaining a balance between the two poles. In a series of public speeches, Prachanda declared that &quot;the era of labeling as pro-India or pro-China is over&quot; and &quot;we are neither pro-China nor pro-India, we are pro-Nepal&quot; and insisted on turning Nepal into a communication channel The bridge between China and India. His &quot;pro-Nepal&quot; foreign policy is based on maintaining balance, mutual trust and friendly relations with both neighboring countries and all friendly countries. On this basis, the interconnection between countries is not only the infrastructure, but also the communication of ideas, markets and hearts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Nepal, it is crucial to maintain common and friendly relations with China and India. This is not only related to Nepal&#39;s prosperity, development and stability, but also related to Nepal&#39;s status as an independent and sovereign country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, there are two major obstacles hindering friendly relations between the three parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, the emergence of right-wing Hindu nationalist leadership in India and its pursuit of the West has obscured the friendly relations between the three neighboring countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, the paralysis of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and India&#39;s negative actions in the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) have opened the way for external powers to intervene in South Asian affairs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the context of changes in the global geopolitical landscape, the deeper concerns expressed by Western countries about Nepal cannot be ignored. For Western countries or any arrogant power, land is extremely important. No matter how big Nepal is, Western countries will spare no effort to include Nepal in their geopolitical alliances. As Professor Li Tao, the editor-in-chief of this book, said: &quot;As the United States intensifies its implementation of the &#39;Indo-Pacific Strategy&#39; and advances its strategic encirclement of our country&#39;s (China&#39;s) neighboring countries, Nepal&#39;s geostrategic status is self-evident.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;Every time the Prime Minister of Nepal takes office, he will continue the tradition of visiting two neighboring countries and demonstrate the good relations between Nepal and neighboring countries through this approach. Prachanda&#39;s visit to China with senior leaders of various countries during the Hangzhou Asian Games is not only a continuation of this diplomatic tradition, but also of great significance in expanding Nepal&#39;s international influence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Prachanda has long advocated that the three neighboring countries maintain peaceful and friendly relations, but the intervention of foreign powers has made this proposal not easy. The people of Nepal have never imagined that Nepal, the &quot;Land of Peace&quot;, would be forced to become a battleground between great powers. They believe that a strong desire for peace, development, prosperity and progress can play a key role in the struggle to prevent imperialism and power politics. effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historically, Nepal (especially the Kathmandu Valley) relied on northern trade as its economic basis, but due to geographical difficulties and weak infrastructure, northern border trade was greatly restricted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In today&#39;s era of rapid advancement in science and technology, these are no longer insurmountable obstacles. For the Chinese who grew up reading the story &quot;The Foolish Old Man Moves the Mountains&quot;, the mountains separating Nepal and China will never become an obstacle to the development of relations between the two countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Author: Niraj Lawoju, doctoral student at Sichuan University; Translator: Wang Jing, associate researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences)&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 30 Sep 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[洗小龙虾被扎手后离世，看完海鲜界隐藏的“杀手”我瑟瑟发抖]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257653]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-30 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/25/ad6c78c463628aa887a857a4ffa251c4.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;4642&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/09/25/ad6c78c463628aa887a857a4ffa251c4.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252080&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/ 25/a34dd0451df96cebb5e6aff7a03aeda4.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;4973&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/25/a34dd0451df96cebb5e6aff7a03aeda4.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252082&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/ c6df904d2b752b5d31dce3c0233e7a93.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;5405&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/ 25/c6df904d2b752b5d31dce3c0233e7a93.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252081&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 30 Sep 2023 13:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[被脱发缠住的年轻人：秃不秃头，并不妨碍爱与被爱]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257902]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-30 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/28/W2lqVDuCFgVGZ7i21WBM4N9BYYD20bXWeGQs28Eg.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/W2lqVDuCFgVGZ7i21WBM4N9BYYD20 bXWeGQs28Eg. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252661&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporters randomly interviewed many &quot;bald young men&quot; with pathological hair loss. It is believed that staying up late, anxiety and chronic stress are important contributors to hair loss. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first severe hair loss started from the top of the head. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A wide slit opens in the middle of the head, and gradually spreads to the left and right sides, turning into an oval. A large area of ​​scalp is exposed, and then spreads uncontrollably. The hair in other places begins to become soft and yellow. , in the end, the hair is like a mature dandelion, falling off with the slightest touch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;As long as you sit down for a while, you will find that there are fallen hairs on the chair, arms, and clothes.&quot; Greedy said. Eight years ago, 20-year-old Gretchen started her own business overseas. In the three months before the trial opening of the store, she was in a high-pressure state of mental stress and physical exhaustion every day. McDonald&#39;s at three in the morning became her most frequent restaurant. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hair loss is the trace left on her body by this day and night hard work. As a daily lingo among young people, &quot;bald-headed&quot; is not only a description of appearance, but also a state of exhaustion in work and life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;25-35 years old, male, working in the IT industry, these three labels delineate the target group of hair transplant customers that Wang Xiaoping, director of Damai Microneedle Hair Transplantation Technology Research Institute, has the most contact with. According to CCTV News, a survey on people with hair loss released by the National Health Commission showed that the number of people with hair loss in my country has exceeded 250 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The high pressure and fast pace of modern life have promoted the trend of younger hair loss from the environmental level. Taking common androgenic alopecia as an example, high mental stress, staying up late, and excessive exercise may all lead to Increased androgen levels will have a negative impact on hair follicles, leading to progressive miniaturization of hair follicles, which is manifested as hair gradually becoming thinner, softer or even falling off.&quot; Liu Yi, deputy chief physician at the Dermatology Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Stress and staying up late &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; are &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;directly reflected on the hair&quot; &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After 35 years old Having just joined a pharmaceutical company as a sales assistant, &quot;older newcomer&quot; Fan Fan felt that everything was too difficult. One person is responsible for various data statistics and administrative management of a sales team of more than 100 people. She works overtime until late at night every day. When she was infected with the new coronavirus for the first time, she only took less than a day&#39;s rest before continuing to work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fan Fan doesn’t dare to make mistakes, but no one is willing to spend time teaching him. The huge workload led to frequent mistakes, which often caused her to be stared at and scolded loudly. She did not dare to bring negative emotions to the workplace, &quot;for fear of being unemployed again at this age.&quot; In the end, all the anger was reserved for the family - &quot;I will yell at the child even if she calls her mother.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2023, 37-year-old Fan Fan decided to resign naked. Two months later, her hairdresser informed her that she had alopecia areata on the top of her head. &quot;Long-term bad mood, insomnia, panic, and gastroenteritis made me realize that I had a serious problem. I decided to resign under the pressure of difficulty in re-employment. However, I soon fell into the anxiety of unemployment. I didn&#39;t expect that I would be unemployed again. Encountered alopecia areata.&quot; Fan Fan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;China Alopecia Areata Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines (2019)&quot; issued by the Chinese Medical Association, alopecia areata is a hair follicle-specific autoimmune disease caused by the combined effect of genetic factors and environmental factors, which is manifested by the sudden onset of clear-cut borders on the scalp. circular patchy hair loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2010, scholars such as Guo Hongwei from the Department of Dermatology at the Southwest Hospital of the Third Military Medical University investigated the correlation between stressful life events and the risk of alopecia areata. The study showed that mental stress plays a significant role in the onset of alopecia areata. , sleep changes are the most dangerous factor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many &quot;bald young men&quot; who suffered from pathological hair loss randomly interviewed by Southern Weekend reporters all believed that staying up late, anxiety and chronic stress were important contributors to their hair loss. At a deeper level, it may be explained by the contemporary German philosopher Han Bingzhe&#39;s description of modern society as a &quot;merit society&quot; - people willingly fall into self-exploitation in a highly competitive environment and are exhausted in their efforts to realize their own value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhu Yu, who loves to play &quot;Honor of Kings&quot;, &quot;particularly cares about winning or losing the game.&quot; After losing, he always wants to wait until he wins before the game ends. He stays up until four or five in the morning to fall asleep almost every day; designer Jiao Jiao She often falls asleep at 3 a.m. in the middle of the night. When interviewed by a reporter from Southern Weekend, she could not fall asleep until 5 or 6 a.m. for a month. Aric, a software engineer, encounters unsolvable problems at work and becomes anxious and nervous to the point of insomnia. According to his observation, nearly half of the programmers around him are suffering from hair loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When she suffered massive hair loss, 24-year-old Tian Luo was the store manager of a real estate agency store in Shanghai. Her daily working hours were from 9 a.m. to 1 a.m. the next day, with six days off and one day off. Even on her only day off, Tian Luo couldn&#39;t truly rest as she had to deal with customer complaints and other work at any time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the year of graduation, Tian Luo came to the &quot;dream Shanghai&quot; from Yunnan, won the first place in regional sales performance from scratch, and was promoted to manager in two years. But like countless young people who feel confused in their struggle, Tian Luo suddenly felt that she had lost her sensitivity to everything around her. &quot;I only had work, performance pressure and staying up late in my eyes, which were directly reflected in my hair.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;If I just met you&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; and I&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;are bald&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;, I&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;can’t choose you. As the other half&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The adolescence Chan Chan had shoulder-length hair. Since she started losing her hair, she has cut her hair shorter and shorter, keeping it above the chin all year round. She also lost 10 hairs, and long hair would visually cause a greater psychological burden to her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because of hair loss, the 1.65-meter-tall Grean Chan habitually walks at the highest point in the group. &quot;If you stand on the escalator first (when the elevator goes down) or stand on a lower step, and the people next to you can see the top of your head, I will try to stand behind you and stand higher than others.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;Medically, hair loss is usually divided into seven levels. Level 7 is the most severe severe hair loss, and Greedy was diagnosed with level 6. &quot;At that time, it was impossible to socialize at all. Whether I saw a rainbow, a shooting star, or any other occasion where I could make a wish, I would sincerely pray. My birthday wish every year is to make my hair grow back.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Severe Along with the hair loss came a diagnosis of depression and anxiety. In his early twenties, Greedy often thought: What is so precious about youth? I&#39;d better live to be fifty as soon as possible, so that when others my age start to go bald, I won&#39;t look different from others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ganchan and her boyfriend met in their freshman year. She was glad that her hair was not as thick as her scalp at that time. Although the other party never expressed concern about hair to Greedy, once, her boyfriend admitted, &quot;If you were like you are now (bald) when we first met, I really wouldn&#39;t be able to choose you as my other partner.&quot; half&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he is most emotionally depressed, Greedy will blame all his unsatisfactory life and work on his hair loss. Sometimes I quarrel with my boyfriend, and I can&#39;t help but think to myself, &quot;If I had hair and wasn&#39;t as ugly as I am now, maybe he wouldn&#39;t quarrel with me.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Mobius strip&quot; of interaction between body and mind may help us better understand the relationship between hair loss and stress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The diseases that negative emotions bring to the body are called psychosomatic diseases in the medical field - physical and organic diseases in which psychosocial factors play an important role in the onset and development. If the internal genetic factors causing hair loss are regarded as bullets, anxiety and internal friction are like triggers, which are important triggers that promote and aggravate the phenomenon of hair loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Physical illness in turn aggravates negative emotions, which can be called a physical and mental reaction, that is, physical illness becomes a psychological stressor and affects mental health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There is an interaction between physical health and mental health. This is because the human body’s nervous system, endocrine system and immune system interact with each other to jointly maintain the stability of the body’s internal environment. This interaction is a physiological and An important research area in the medical field is called the bio-psycho-social model.

In more than a year, she experienced three &quot;crazy hair loss periods&quot;. Each time she washed her hair, she lost one to two hundred strands, which lasted about 20 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After long-term use of minoxidil, Lan Pingping found that her whole body had become hirsutious, and her scalp also had acne from time to time, but she never thought about stopping. The hair that came out also fell out.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In interviews with reporters from Southern Weekend, almost all hair loss patients admitted that they have used common anti-hair loss products on the market, including but not limited to anti-hair loss shampoos, laser hair growth caps, scalp essences, massage combs, and five-part anti-hair loss products. Black powder, black sesame balls, etc. Among them, the most commonly mentioned is minoxidil hair growth solution administered as an over-the-counter drug. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Minoxidil was originally a drug used to treat high blood pressure, but was accidentally discovered to promote hair growth. Liu Yi believes that there is some abuse of minoxidil due to promotion by e-commerce platforms and self-media. Although minoxidil is relatively safe, it may also cause some side effects, such as local allergies or irritation reactions, hirsutism, etc., and in a few cases, it may even cause a drop in blood pressure, tachycardia, etc. Therefore, its application is best carried out under the guidance of a doctor to avoid abuse and overdose to ensure safety and effectiveness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;First, minoxidil is a therapeutic drug, and it is not necessary to use it for the purpose of preventing hair loss when hair loss does not occur; second, although androgenic alopecia is the main cause of hair loss, Causes, but telogen effluvium, alopecia areata, etc. are also very common, and some patients may be accompanied by other underlying diseases, so the type of hair loss should be judged by a doctor before treatment. For example, diffuse alopecia areata, the clinical manifestations can be similar to androgenic alopecia, but used alone Minoxidil is usually not very effective,&quot; Liu Yi said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a long illness, Greanman often reads research papers in the field of hair loss and thinks he has tried almost all anti-hair loss products on the market. She has bought five to six thousand yuan of supplements from domestic micro-businessmen that claim to &quot;radically cure hair loss&quot;, and has also spent 10,000 yuan to buy imported 650 nanometer laser hair caps. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In her opinion, some high-priced products actually have low raw materials and are just an &quot;IQ tax&quot; labeled &quot;anti-hair loss&quot;. Most products have limited help in hair growth, and it is difficult to produce visible hair loss when used alone. Visible hair growth effects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Cosmetics Supervision and Administration Regulations&quot; that will be implemented in 2021, the original hair growth cosmetics category will be cancelled. Hair growth cosmetics that have obtained the &quot;National Cosmetic Special Label&quot; in the past will be classified as &quot;hair growth cosmetics&quot; after a five-year transition period. Stop production and sales. Newly added anti-hair loss cosmetics are registered and managed as &quot;special purpose cosmetics&quot; and require efficacy testing at a cosmetics administrative licensing inspection agency. They can be produced and sold only after approval by the State Food and Drug Administration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Yi believes that the popularity of anti-hair loss products shows that the current hair loss problem still faces huge unmet clinical needs. &quot;For androgenic alopecia, the most common type of hair loss, currently only two drugs, finasteride and minoxidil, are approved for treatment in China. However, some patients have poor efficacy, coupled with safety concerns and other factors, Therefore, there is a demand for alternative methods in the market.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Build your own combination boxing&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2021, Greedy decided to finally fight for Shengfa She tried her best once, and if she failed again, she decided to let herself go. &quot;I can&#39;t continue to struggle in the whirlpool of hair loss. Even if I have no hair and wear a wig all my life, I still want to be a happy little girl.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gantan listed the experience he gained from seeking medical treatment for seven years, and created a set of &quot;hair growth combination boxing&quot; methods that cover washing and care steps, medication combination, dietary structure, and work and rest adjustments. Looking back, Greedy thinks that was the moment when &quot;the gears of his destiny began to turn.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;When I completely relaxed my mood, adjusted my lifestyle, and followed my DIY method for two months, my scalp began to be covered with new hair, and my hair grew back again.&quot; Speaking of this &quot;Miracle&quot;, Greedy still finds it incredible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this set of combos, Greedy insists on completing at least two of the three things &quot;eat well, sleep well, feel good&quot; every day. She made a video of her experience and shared it on the Internet, which received tens of thousands of likes. Greanman discovered that she was not the only one suffering from hair loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, once alopecia is diagnosed, it is likely that you will need to fight it for life. Waiting for the emergence of new technologies and reconciling with oneself have become life issues for &quot;bald young people&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fu Hongbo, a 22-year-old senior in college, was diagnosed with androgenic alopecia. After using minoxidil for nearly a year with no obvious results, he chose to go to a hair transplant institution for forehead transplantation. To his surprise, the forehead after hair transplantation was still visibly sparse, accompanied by a large amount of shedding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tu Ming, dean of Yonghe’s hair transplant business, told Southern Weekend reporters that the principle of hair transplantation is to transplant healthy hair follicles from the occipital area of ​​the body to areas with sparse hair. It is mainly used in androgenic alopecia. With current technical means, androgenic alopecia cannot be cured. Therefore, hair transplantation can improve the current aesthetic problem, but it does not mean that hair loss can be stopped after hair transplantation. Controlling hair loss to a more satisfactory level requires long-term medication and maintenance. treat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the slightly M-angled hairline of his newborn son, Aric worried that his M-shaped hair loss would be passed on to the next generation. Fu Hongbo&#39;s way of explaining his explanation is &quot;I believe in the development of science and technology. Maybe hair follicle cloning technology will appear in a few years to completely solve this problem.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The medical community never stops working hard. In June 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Pfizer&#39;s new drug Ritlecitinib for the treatment of alopecia areata in adolescents and adults aged 12 years and older. Ritexitinib becomes the first drug approved to treat adolescents with alopecia areata. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Compared with baricitinib, the first treatment for severe alopecia areata in adults approved in China, ritexitinib has a stronger targeting effect on the autoimmune inflammatory pathways related to alopecia areata. It is safer and more effective, bringing new breakthroughs in the treatment of alopecia areata,&quot; Liu Yi said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, Greedy is a &quot;hair growth blogger&quot; with 100,000 followers on social media. There are always people leaving private messages, asking her to recommend a product that is most helpful for hair growth. Gretchen replies over and over again: &quot;Don&#39;t believe that any product can cure your hair loss. The only way is to start by changing your lifestyle.&quot; , build your own combination punch.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a brand manager engaged in marketing and product development, Mei Lan was diagnosed with diffuse alopecia areata in June 2022. After experiencing hair loss for half a year, Mei Lan seemed to have been reborn. &quot;No matter how busy you are at work, you still have to exercise every day. People always have to give themselves some space. When life is no longer limited to one branch, I naturally no longer care about the gains and losses on this road, because I will have many branches.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;It is not easy to make peace with yourself and hair loss. Her hair is like a greedy experimental field. She keeps sowing seeds on it. Sometimes the harvest is poor and sometimes it is abundant. Even if she has a set of &quot;combination punches&quot; to deal with it, sometimes a mood swing is enough to destroy all the hard work and she has to start from scratch. came. But the good news is that as long as you continue to maintain a good attitude and living habits, everything will happily get better. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;馋馋没有和谈了九年的男朋友走散，他们在2023年结婚，回顾这场感情时她写下——&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“其实，秃不秃头，并不妨碍真正的爱与被爱。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（文中除王小平、刘毅、崔韶芳、涂明外，其余受访者为化名）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 30 Sep 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[网络炒热的韩国防猝死套餐，是真的要命]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257412]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-30 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/30/JDT8Ejb6qBaGrTcyi4GdEVs1TtAJGoO77KOirq5R.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/JDT8Ejb6qBaGrTcyi4GdEVs1TtAJGoO7 7KOirq5R. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252839&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC photo/图） &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Recently, a sudden death prevention package that is said to have become popular in South Korea has been on the hot search. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This package is composed of coenzyme Q10, fish oil, lutein, vitamin D3 and other health products. Some netizens shared that they feel very energetic after taking it. Questioning that such a &quot;sudden death prevention package&quot; does not really have the effect of preventing sudden death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In this regard, some experts believe that sudden death is a type of disease, and health food itself does not have a clinical role in treatment or prevention. It can be eaten but can only be used as a Health aid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the final analysis, the &quot;sudden death prevention package&quot; has triggered heated discussions, mainly due to the mentality of contemporary young people who love to stay up late and are afraid of sudden death. The truly effective &quot;sudden death prevention method&quot; &quot;what exactly is it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/22/d065c741f2.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;548&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/22/d065c741f2.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251683&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Why do people die suddenly? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;First of all, let’s look at why people die suddenly from a medical perspective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;No other disease can compare with the suddenness, urgency, severity, malignancy and consequences of sudden death. The occurrence of sudden death is unexpected and cannot be predicted in most cases. This is why sudden death is the most terrible disease in the world. Clinically, sudden death can be divided into two categories, namely sudden cardiac death and non-cardiac sudden death. Among all patients who die suddenly, 75% are caused by heart disease, the most common cause of which is coronary heart disease; about 25% are caused by non-cardiac diseases (i.e., the patient has causes other than the heart). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In order to facilitate understanding, I divide it into internal causes and external causes. The internal cause is the premature aging of the body&#39;s own functions, weakening the ability to decompose and eliminate metabolic waste and toxins entering the body and produced by the body itself, resulting in abnormal body metabolism, increased blood lipids, blood sugar, and uric acid, and excessive accumulation of fat in the internal organs, blood, and subcutaneous tissue. Formation of atherosclerotic plaques (fatty plaques that line the walls of arteries). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Once these plaques rupture, they will immediately stimulate coagulation function in the corresponding blood vessels, forming thrombus almost instantly. If a certain branch of the heart blood vessel is blocked, Sudden death will occur if the heart is suddenly ischemic. Therefore, maintaining a youthful state of the body and improving the normal functions of various organ systems in the body are fundamental to prevention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;External factors refer to various factors outside the body and attached to the body, which lead to the deterioration of physical conditions. This is all too common in the workplace: the glamorous appearance cannot hide the tiredness caused by working overtime and staying up late, the pressure from bosses, superiors and project progress, the open and secret fights between peers and colleagues, commuting to and from work, squeezing into elevators, subways, heavy traffic jams, and lack of sleep. , irregular diet, having to socialize with each other, lack of exercise, supporting a family, and all kinds of consumption for the sake of face...&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;All of these are overdrafting your body , making the already disordered hormone secretion and metabolic system in your body even more overwhelmed, exacerbating the possibility of tragedy. That is to say, insufficient rest, insufficient and extremely unbalanced nutrients, and long-term mental stress, resulting in the body being unable to repair and improve itself normally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, the most fundamental thing is that your heart function is already in a bad state, but you don&#39;t know it at all. Coupled with the above-mentioned workplace pressures, the chance of sudden death greatly increases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/Hl2cmWoPON0F3tUJkXGtlvba93yX5nhFYxqhQTdi.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/Hl2cmWoPON0F3tUJkXGtlvba93yX5nhFYxqhQTdi.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252840&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;You can’t just resign and quit, right? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some people say that my working status is like this, I can’t resign, right? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, for some people, resigning may be a good idea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, if you have to stick to this job in order to support your family, try to make the following adjustments, which will not only prevent sudden death, but more importantly It can make up for your overdrafted health and live a healthy life for yourself and your family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;1. First go to a regular hospital and ask a responsible doctor to do a comprehensive physical examination (especially to check for hidden cardiovascular diseases). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2. Scientific diet and balanced nutrition: A reasonable dietary structure means that the nutrients contained in the diet are complete in variety, sufficient in quantity, and in appropriate proportions to satisfy both needs and requirements. It can meet the physiological needs of the body and avoid imbalances in the proportion of nutrients in the diet (or even nutritional disorders caused by lack or excess of certain nutrients). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is best to have three meals a day: a. Vegetables and fruits: more varieties are better, mainly supplementing vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, etc., every day The number of meals should be at least equivalent to the size of one&#39;s own fist; b. Protein foods: mainly supplement various amino acids, trace elements, vitamins, etc. necessary for the human body, including meat proteins (such as seafood, chicken, duck, and fish meat), each meal The quantity is equivalent to the size of your palm minus your fingers) and non-meat proteins (eggs, milk, soy products, etc., the quantity of each meal is equivalent to the size of your fist); c. Grain and starch foods: various rice and flour products, potatoes Categories, corn, etc., mainly supplement starch (sugar), vitamins, dietary fiber, etc. The amount of each meal is equivalent to the size of your own fist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, according to a random survey of more than 10,000 people by relevant research institutions in the United States, the vast majority of people are unable to achieve truly balanced nutrition through diet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;3. Adhere to scientific and reasonable exercise: According to the results of the physical examination, combined with physical condition and time, carry out step-by-step exercise (you can practice by yourself, or you can go to the gym to do it) Personal training depends on your own hobbies and level of wealth). However, no matter where you exercise, the so-called aerobic exercise (such as running, swimming, cycling, etc.) and anaerobic exercise (mainly strength exercise) must be closely integrated and indispensable, and must reach a certain intensity. Only then will your exercise have a real effect on improving physical function. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;4. Develop good living habits: Try not to stay up late. You may not feel the harm once or twice occasionally. Staying up late for a long time is overdrafting your health. . Adequate and high-quality sleep is a necessary means for the body to repair itself and regulate its functions. Overdraft without actively replenishing it is like a mobile phone battery that has been depleted but not recharged in time. The final result can be imagined. As for the harm that heavy drinking (whether short-term or long-term habitual) does to the body, even if I don’t say it, most people will understand it! &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;5. Emotional management: Although it is difficult to control emotions in a busy working environment, remember not to let yourself be overjoyed or sad. This is meaningful to ensure that you can live a healthy and safe life and maintain a harmonious family and society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;6. Supplement safe and effective health products: If you accept the basic common sense that the human body is composed of substances, you should understand that without an adequate material basis, the functions will not be sufficient. How much better would it be. Theoretically, all injuries in the human body can be cured through its own repair. The basic raw materials for repair are nutrients such as protein, lipids, sugars, vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber and water. However, the reality is that today’s food can no longer provide adequate and balanced nutrition to the body. Therefore, it is not a question of whether to take health supplements or not, but that you have to take health supplements for your health. Everyone&#39;s nutritional deficiencies exist objectively, but the degree of deficiency is different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;7. Appropriate drug intervention for discovered diseases: However, drugs only target symptoms, they are not the fundamental factor in solving the problem. The contribution of medical intervention to human health only accounts for about 10%, and the rest is the result of the above comprehensive factors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;I found someone suspected of sudden death, what should I do? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What should you do if you find someone suspected of sudden death? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;First, identify cardiac arrest and call 120 emergency services. Second, take cardiopulmonary resuscitation measures quickly. I won’t go into details about the specific steps. The principle is to check breathing and heartbeat, and clear the airway, and then perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation mainly with chest compressions (if it is a sudden cardiac arrest). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The compression position is in the middle left of the sternum (most people&#39;s heart is in the left chest), 100 to 120 times per minute, and the depth is 5 to 6 centimeters. The key is to continue compressions until professional rescuers arrive. Third, implement defibrillation as soon as possible. For sudden cardiac arrest, the most effective first aid method is electric defibrillation. If it is done one minute earlier, the patient&#39;s hope of survival will increase by 10%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 30 Sep 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中国男篮亚运两连胜，球员坦言球队仍需成长适应大赛强度]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257936]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-30 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 28, 2023, Chinese team player Zhang Zhenlin broke through Chinese Taipei under the basket The player defends and shoots the basket.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/48085416cd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/48085416cd.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252832&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 28, 2023, Chinese team player Zhang Zhenlin broke through the defense of Chinese Taipei team players under the basket and shot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 28, 2023, in the Asian Games Basketball Men’s Preliminary Group B match at the Hangzhou Olympic Sports Center Gymnasium, the Chinese team ushered in the first place in the group stage.

Liang Gewen, the former Secretary of the Qingyuan Municipal Party Committee, mentioned it again. The &quot;Qingyuan Experience&quot; evolved from the 5 yuan reward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Qingyuan Experience&quot; was an attempt by Qingyuan to expand enterprise autonomy and mobilize workers&#39; enthusiasm at the beginning of reform and opening up, and pioneered the reform of state-owned enterprises in Guangdong. Over the past 45 years, the &quot;Qingyuan Experience&quot; advocating &quot;dare to be the first&quot; has continued to play different roles in various historical periods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to Liang Gewen, the event also invited Deng Sai from the Party Building Office of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of Guangdong Province and Lu Guowei, member of the Party Branch of Lianzhang Village, Lianjiangkou Town, Yingde City. The three of them witnessed different stages of reform and opening up. . Deng Sai was one of the first batch of civil servants recruited openly when the Provincial State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission was established in 2004. He has deep feelings about the reform of state-owned enterprises in the past two decades. Lu Guowei shared the great changes in Lianzhang Village in the past five years from the perspective of a grassroots poverty alleviation cadre. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the event, the 80-year-old Liang Gewen always emphasized that today we still need to emancipate our minds and boldly innovate. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;More work, more rewards, turn losses into profits&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 1978, on the eve of reform and opening up, Qingyuan began to implement the &quot;exceeding plan profit commission bonus&quot; reform . Liang Gewen, then the press secretary of the Qingyuan County Party Committee, was 35 years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liang Gewen has a deep understanding of Qingyuan’s traffic. Qingyuan is located in the mountainous area of ​​northern Guangdong and has inconvenient transportation. At that time, there was no road from Qingyuan to Guangzhou, so one had to cross the river by boat and then take a bumpy car. Liang Gewen went to Guangzhou to deliver articles to newspapers. Riding a motorcycle was faster than a car. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The geographical location led to Qingyuan&#39;s economic backwardness to a certain extent. Its economic aggregate and fiscal revenue basically ranked at the bottom of the province at that time. In 1977, Qingyuan failed to complete the profit plan issued by the state and suffered a loss of more than 300,000 yuan. Some companies even needed to borrow money from the local government to pay workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because workers eat from a big pot, it doesn’t make much difference whether they work more or less. Qingyuan’s largest state-owned nitrogen fertilizer factory at the time faced the problem of workers being passive and slow in working. The nitrogen fertilizer plant, which was put into operation in 1970, was the largest factory with the most workers in Qingyuan at that time. However, the annual output of a medium-sized fertilizer factory with more than 400 people was only more than 5,000 tons at its peak. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Output cannot increase, and the factory has been losing money year after year. According to factory employees, when farmers queued up to buy fertilizer, some people started fighting over it. &quot;If fertilizers cannot keep up, food production will be reduced, and farmers will have to look for fertilizers everywhere.&quot; Liang Gewen said. During the busy farming season of July and August every year, the county party committee secretary would come to the factory to supervise production. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The turning point occurred in October 1978. A policy called &quot;Super Planned Profit Commission Award&quot; was first piloted at Qingyuan Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before this reform, there was an accident in the factory. A worker accidentally closed the wrong valve of a gas tank, causing the gas tank to become severely deformed. According to past experience, it takes three months to repair. In order to meet the construction deadline, the factory leaders summoned technical personnel from all over Qingyuan and promised that whoever could repair the equipment and resume production in advance would be rewarded 5 yuan. In the end, it only took 10 days to complete the task. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is the concept of 5 yuan? At that time, workers&#39; monthly salary was 33 yuan. In order to support their families, many workers go to the mountains to cut firewood, go down to the rivers to catch fish, and fish for snails in the fields after get off work to increase their income. &quot;Five yuan can buy eight pounds of pork. At that time, the target was half a pound of pork per person per month.&quot; Liang Gewen said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This incident made the factory leaders realize that incentives can be used to mobilize motivation. In the atmosphere of great discussion on the issue of truth standards, the nitrogen fertilizer plant also held a discussion meeting. An agreement was reached at the meeting to improve everyone&#39;s enthusiasm through reforming the reward system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since October 1978, the county party committee began to pilot the &quot;exceeding plan profit commission award&quot; in four plants including the nitrogen fertilizer plant. &quot;For example, if we plan to hand over 1 million yuan in profits, if the annual profit is 1.5 million yuan, we will take part of the 500,000 yuan and distribute it to the workers.&quot; Liang Gewen explained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the mechanism of more reward for more work, the efficiency of the factory has been significantly improved. After 18 days of trial operation, a profit of 35,000 yuan was achieved in the month. This was also the first month to achieve profit in nine years of production. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Opposition&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Reform is not without opposition. Some departments in the county consider this to be a &quot;private division of state property.&quot; Fortunately, with the support of county leaders, it was implemented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reform of the nitrogen fertilizer plant has even attracted the attention of the Guangdong Provincial Government. But the opinions in the province are not unified. In May 1979, the finance and labor departments of Guangdong Province jointly issued a document requiring Qingyuan County to stop implementing the &quot;exceeding plan profit commission award.&quot; The reason is that there is a lack of documentary evidence and the commission ratio is too large. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three months later, at the group discussion of the Guangdong Provincial Industrial Transportation Production Increase and Conservation Conference, the debate on the &quot;Qingyuan Experience&quot; was settled. The meeting decided to promote Qingyuan’s “Exceeding Plan Profit Commission Award” to county-owned industrial enterprises across Guangdong Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth mentioning that since turning losses into profits in 1979, the nitrogen fertilizer plant has achieved profits every year. By 1989, it had achieved a total profit of nearly 10 million yuan for 11 consecutive years. In the years that followed, Liang Gewen was often asked about the impact of the &quot;Qingyuan Experience&quot; on Guangdong. His answer was simple - the most important thing was that the cadres and masses of the nitrogen fertilizer plant dared to be the first and boldly innovated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The courage to be the first and bold innovation in the &quot;Qingyuan Experience&quot; have also taken root in the reform of state-owned enterprises in Guangdong Province. According to Deng Sai, since the three-year action of state-owned enterprise reform was launched in 2020, &quot;Guangdong&#39;s state-owned economic layout structure has also undergone major changes, and state-owned capital has become more concentrated in important industries and key areas related to the national economy and people&#39;s livelihood.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is understood that as of the end of 2022, the total assets of local state-owned assets supervision enterprises in Guangdong Province reached 16.27 trillion yuan, ranking third among local supervision enterprises in the country. In 2022, the operating income and profits of local state-owned assets supervision enterprises in the province The total amount ranked third and second in the country respectively. Among the province&#39;s local state-owned assets supervision enterprises, 6 have entered the Fortune Global 500. &quot;This means that Guangdong&#39;s state-owned economy continues to grow in scale and strength, and is promoting the sustained and healthy development of the national economy.&quot; Deng Sai said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lianzhang Village, located in the northeast of Qingyuan City, is experiencing the &quot;Qingyuan Experience&quot; in the new era. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Born in 1993, Lu Guowei is a native of Lianzhang Village. He often hears people mention the story of the reform of the nitrogen fertilizer plant. In 2017, Lu Guowei returned to his hometown and became a grassroots poverty alleviation cadre. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Guowei remembers that when he was a child, Lianzhang Village was one of the poorest villages in Lianjiangkou Town. The village was surrounded by mountains and only connected to the outside world by a rugged road. The village&#39;s pillar industry was Sugar orange. &quot;Except for a small amount of rice, peanuts, and corn, every household grows sugar oranges,&quot; Lu Guowei said. In 2011, affected by Huanglongbing, almost all the sugar orange trees in the village were wiped out. In the end, except for a small number of people planting bamboo shoots, most young adults chose to go out to work, while the elderly and children stayed behind in the village. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, Lianzhang Village has gradually explored new paths for rural development. On the basis of vigorously developing specialty industries such as bamboo shoots and black tea, it also simultaneously promotes the intensive processing of specialty agricultural products. Lu Guowei said that currently there are more than 20 small and large enterprises stationed in the village, realizing everyone&#39;s wish to work at home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Whether it is for Lianzhang Village or Qingyuan, we still have to dare to think and act.&quot; Liang Gewen said with emotion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 30 Sep 2023 09:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[在诺奖得主古尔纳的故乡，大海不再只有伤痛 | 月是故乡明②]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257356]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-30 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/ 11/07/b840996666c29ba0936ba0ac8e934fd8.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;578&quot; height=&quot;386&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/ b840996666c29ba0936ba0ac8e934fd8.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;169416&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Zanzibar, a woman picks up seaweed at low tide. /ICphoto&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On the occasion of the New Year in 2016, I came to Zanzibar for the first time - &quot;Unguja Island&quot; from the southern big island&lt;/span>;&lt;span style =&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(also known as &quot;Zanzibar Island&quot;)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, the northern island &quot;Pemba Island&quot; and other small islands, hereinafter referred to as &quot;Zanzibar Island&quot;—— The capital of Stone Town&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(&quot;StoneTown&quot;)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, on a hazy morning at sunrise, I walked to the edge of the Indian Ocean with jagged reefs. Fishermen returning from the sea came ashore. They were shirtless, laughing and yelling in Swahili with tired faces. They pulled the not-full nets ashore, picked out lobsters, large octopus and tuna, and threw aside the remaining inferior goods. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;A few hours later, these high-quality and fresh seafood will be delivered to a number of high-end Western, Indian, Arabic or Swahili restaurants. Then it is placed on the plates of tourists from all over the world. Those of poor quality will be transported to the local fish market and sold to countless people wearing bamboo baskets on their heads and wearing colorful kanga at a price of less than one-twentieth.&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color : #888888;&quot;>;(Traditional costumes of Swahili women)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, local women chattering enthusiastically. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;I think that if I read the novels of Abdul Razak Gourna, at that moment, I might not be able to help but think of those in his different stories. A long paragraph about Mulberry Island, and empathize with it, such as: &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote data-type=&quot;2&quot; data-url=&quot;&quot; data-author-name=&quot;&quot; data-content-utf8 -length=&quot;113&quot; data-source-title=&quot;&quot;>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;...the water plants were washed endlessly by the waves, lying on the beach It’s like a sunburned dream. There’s also the smell of sea salt, floating in every corner, in the nostrils and in the cochlea, just like the monsoon wind blowing from the sea and the port.&quot; (&quot;Farewell&quot; &quot;Memory of Departure&quot;, 1987)&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Unfortunately, although I have lived in Tanzania for six years and visited San Island three times, on October 7, 2021 Before the Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to Gurna, I knew nothing about this author who grew up on Sand Island until he was 18 years old. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1955, Stone Town&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the East African Islands, the dominant position has always been the sea, and the ocean further offshore. Every November, the southwest monsoon and ocean currents blow through southern India, southern Arabia and the coast of Somalia, to San Island, and then further south to the Comoros Islands and Madagascar. Before tourism became the main industry of Sand Island, the vast majority of people in Stone Town relied on the sea for their livelihood, including fishermen, sailors and merchants who came and went with the wind. At one time, there were dangerous merchants who sold ivory, spices and slaves. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In today&#39;s Stone City, various houses of different sizes are dotted along the entire coastline. Many are Islamic-style buildings, and a few are decorated with complicated European patterns. It has been converted into post offices, office buildings, cafes, restaurants and private residences, among which there are many simple shabby iron shacks owned by local fishermen. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At the beginning of 2019, I came to Stone City for the third time. Taking advantage of the New Year holiday, I wandered around for nearly a week, looking at the remains of the ancient shell city wall seven or eight centuries ago. See the dungeons and chains at the former site of the slave trading market, and the monument to the 1964 Zan Island Uprising&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(Zanzibar uprising to overthrow the Sudanese rule, 4 years later, Gurna left Sang to go to England)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;See how the lovely blue water licks the rocks of history little by little. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/0f29c1a85781d77f84cf6340ecd8f7ba.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/0f29c1a85781d77f84cf6340ecd8f7ba.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;169419&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;Writer Abdul-Razzak Gurnatou/Visual China&lt;/span >;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;One evening, I was walking in the old city and came to a square old house. It was hidden, but it was empty inside. It is not clear whether the house is for private or public use. Walking around the alley next to the house to the backyard, you can see a group of little boys wearing robes and square hats. They are squatting and playing with marbles and soda bottle caps. On the other side of the yard, there were several men leaning against the wall. They crossed their arms and talked about the rainy season, the wind direction and the lowest price for buying lilacs. Behind them were several women who set up small stalls selling fruits and vegetables. They seemed to be selling scattered dried fish, cherry tomatoes and onions. In fact, they were more interested in chatting. It didn&#39;t matter whether the things could be sold or not. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The sun was setting at that time, and the light shone just right in the yard and on the roof, and finally briefly settled on the sweaty brows and cheeks of men, women, old and young. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After walking out of the yard, I went to a cafe across the street, ordered a cup of Americano with clove flavor, and pulled out an old book from the bookshelf. The book is called &quot;Eye of Cloves&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(&quot;Eye of Cloves&quot;, F.D. Omani)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, published in 1955. When I opened it, I didn&#39;t have any expectations, it was just to kill time. Sand Island is called the &quot;Lilac Island&quot;, so judging from this title, it is not much different from most travel books about Sand Island. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;I flipped through the pages of the book until I saw an old black and white photo. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Isn’t that square house and yard in the photo the same place I just passed by? More than fifty years have passed, and nothing seems to have changed. It seems that even people&#39;s status and clothing have been frozen at that moment. The adults sit or stand bored, and the children run or jump carefree. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The caption of the photo reads: Arab residential area. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This description can be used to summarize almost any neighborhood I passed through today, but to put it more accurately, most of the neighborhoods can be called &quot;Indian Arab Swahili&quot; Xili Mixed Residential Area&quot;. Because in today&#39;s Stone City, the vast majority of locals are accustomed to interracial trade, mixing, and intermarriage. It is difficult to accurately identify whether a person is of Arab, Indian, Southeast Asian, or Sri Lankan descent just by looking at his skin color and dress. With Vasili ancestry or a mixture of two or even three of them, almost everyone became a &quot;Zanzibar&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/b916a255dac148c595805f20cc1d0b79.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/b916a255dac148c595805f20cc1d0b79.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;169420&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;Overlooking Stone City/Visual China&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span >;In 2015, Gurner mentioned this residential area in a lecture at the University of Kent where he teaches. He was born and grew up in Stone Town, an area generally known as the &quot;Arab residential area.&quot; He projected a related black-and-white photo in class. The photo showed a small square house with a simple two-story building standing on the left. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote data-type=&quot;2&quot; data-url=&quot;&quot; data-author-name=&quot;&quot; data-content-utf8-length=&quot;98&quot; data-source-title=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;p>;&quot;I was born in the small building on the left. When I was a child, we always stood on the terrace on the second floor and watched the sailing ships leaving the port or returning from the sea, one after another, loaded with various goods. If you go downstairs and pass through the courtyard downstairs, you will see a workplace, a warehouse, and a vegetable market behind it.&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;blockquote data-type=&quot;2&quot; data-url= &quot;&quot; data-author-name=&quot;&quot; data-content-utf8-length=&quot;244&quot; data-source-title=&quot;&quot;>; &lt;p>;But what you can’t see from the photo is what kind of person he is. Live in this place. If you could see them, you might feel helpless like me. Why? Because when the outside world talks about us and this place, they will always savagely describe it as The complexity and richness are summed up in these seven colorless words (referring to the &quot;Arab residential area&quot;)... But in fact, in the house at the back, there lived an Indian family; next to them, lived The president of the Lilac Planting Association is an Englishman; the house on the far side is the local police station, and the chief is a San Island native of Somali descent; behind the police station is a cafe run by a Yemeni businessman... But According to convention, this is only an Arab residential area.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Gulna described all this calmly to the thoughtful college students in the audience, except for the slightly wrinkled Meifeng, no emotion can be seen. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;I think of that photo taken in 1955. Gurna was only about 7 years old that year. Maybe he was among the group of children playing in the background of the photo. From that time until he left home at the age of 18, it was a decade of great change in the history of Sang Island. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/5da0c2c9b6ad5aaebca8654dfef6c27c.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/5da0c2c9b6ad5aaebca8654dfef6c27c.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;169421&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A man draws characteristic tingatinga paintings and sells them to tourists/ICphoto&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1964, Mulberry Island Revolution&lt;/h3>; &lt; p>;&lt;span>;In &quot;Lilac Eyes&quot;, I also turned to another dated black and white photo. Its caption read: European residential area - although the large Arab-style flat-roofed building in the photo looks There is nothing &quot;European&quot; about it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The next day, I found out the specific location of the building. After arriving, I discovered that the building complex was built one after another by Arab merchants two to three centuries ago. In the 19th century, the British became more and more active on Sand Island. Until the end of the 19th century, Sand Island became a British protectorate and this area was officially occupied by the British. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 1872, Richard Belden published two issues of his travel diary about Zan Island, &quot;Zanzibar: City, Island and Seaside&quot;, and many subsequent comments They all thought that he might want to use this to hint that European readers had begun to explore the source of the Nile in 1856, much earlier than Livingston. But surprisingly, the influence of this diary is more evident in his inadvertent description of the slave trading system on Sand Island, which reminds people that the slave trade in East Africa is no less rampant than in West Africa. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As a meeting place for Arabs, Indians, Europeans and Africans, San Island is like a corridor connecting various rooms and halls, and at the same time provides sweet dates from the Arab region. Plantations, the tea fields of India, and the sugar industry of Southeast Asia&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(even the Americas)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; provided labor. The most miserable ones were the male slaves who were selected as eunuchs by the Ottoman Empire. Because of the unhygienic conditions of castration, usually only one in ten could survive. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Belden mentioned: Investigations show that before 1897, when the British used both carrot and stick to ask the Sultan who was in power at that time to abolish slavery, two-thirds of the people on Sand Island were of the population belonged to the slave class. Still, Belden wrote, it was difficult for him to differentiate between black and brown people and what their ancestry was. &quot;Swahili, Persian&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(later developed into the &quot;Shiraz ethnic group&quot;)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, Arabia and India...all mixed together , I feel that the people here&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(referring to Sang Island)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; are simply like a brand new race.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/span>; p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 1890, the British officially took over Sand Island, but did not provide any effective and constructive mechanism for sustainable development. Land, wealth and power are still highly concentrated in Asia&lt;/span>;&lt;span style =&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(Including Arabia)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;In the hands of the merchant class. At the same time, as was the practice in many other colonial powers, the rulers adopted a rigid management method in Sand Island by classifying all civilians according to their ethnicity and forcing them into a certain ethnic identity group. This made the tension inherent in the complex and subtle multi-racial mixture of Mulberry Island suddenly become tense. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Until the 1950s, a political storm against colonial rule swept across Africa. In 1963, Sand Island declared independence from the United Kingdom, the new Sudan succeeded to the throne, and British forces hurriedly withdrew from Sand Island. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Two days after leaving the &quot;European residential area&quot;, I came to the outskirts of Stone City and stayed at a B&amp;B recommended by a friend. &quot;Chat with the boss, you I&#39;ll be interested.&quot; My friend told me with a wink. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Wilson, the owner of the B&amp;B, is a Tanzanian, British-Indian, 70-year-old man. He was born and raised on Sand Island until he was 6 years old, and then moved to Sang Island with his parents. Dar es Salaam&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(Tanzania&#39;s largest city)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;until the age of 20, then went to Edinburgh to attend university for four years. anthropology. After graduation, he changed three or four teaching jobs. &quot;I felt like I couldn&#39;t find a sense of belonging no matter how much I stayed in Europe,&quot; so he returned to East Africa. At first he wanted to take root on San Island again, but before he could settle down, he encountered the 1964 revolution. He had to take his Indian wife and three children and flee to Nairobi and Mombasa on the coast of Kenya, where he lived for more than ten years. Then we moved to the evergreen town of Mosh at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. It was not until 2005 that he returned to Sang Island and has settled there ever since. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;I found Wilson and sat with him among the coconut trees in the evening breeze, drinking ice-cold ginger ale. His eyes were as low as his voice, and like most people on Mulberry Island, it was difficult to tell where he came from just by looking at his appearance. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“Although I am not a real Sandao person, when I talked about the revolution with many Sandao people, I found that their memories of it and their The definition of it - whether it is good or bad, good or bad, depends largely on who they consider their best friend, who they often share a pot of coffee with, or who they often invite into their home. Relatives and friends for dinner, in general, are extremely personal. For example, if your best friend is an Indian or a Shiraz, your evaluation of the revolution may be completely different. , because the Indians may be robbed and killed, but Shiraz can escape unscathed...&quot; Wilson said slowly. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“But in fact, the revolution had already begun to take shape before 1964,” Wilson continued, “because it had only been more than half a century since slavery was abolished. , the old skeleton of society was basically shattered, and a reasonable new skeleton had not yet taken shape. It was full of loopholes. In addition, the British implemented many policies and regulations on clear class divisions. The Arabs still occupied a large number of people in San Island at that time. Absolutely outstanding status. So when the British withdrew, the undercurrent of conflict between the majority of landless African laborers and the minority of Arab landowners immediately transformed into a revolution.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>;Wilson still remembers that in 1963, in Stone Town after independence, the iron gates of the police station were opened one after another, and all the imprisoned and beaten Africans poured into the streets and alleys, with eyes full of resentment and rage, as if they were gathering strength. , volcanic lava ready to erupt at any time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At 3 a.m. on January 12, 1964, the &quot;African-Shirazi Party&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>; (ASP, Afro-Shirazi Party&quot; member and Ugandan John Okello led 600-800 &quot;revolutionaries&quot; with extremely simple equipment to launch a surprise attack on the police headquarters and radio station. They had no guns and ammunition, only spears, machetes, iron rods and daggers. However, because of their surprise and desperate determination, they won comprehensively in just a few hours. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In this regard, the leader of the revolution, Oklo, always insisted that the actions of himself and other insurrectionists were &quot;pilgrimage acts&quot; in order to do justice for heaven and liberate the people who were persecuted. The people of San Island. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/a73eb2ebf13993d40816f628301beeb7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/a73eb2ebf13993d40816f628301beeb7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;169423&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Citizens chatting on the street/ICphoto&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2005, at the seaside&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In &quot;Pilgrimage&quot; &quot;Pilgrims Way&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(PilgrimsWay, 1988)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;In &quot;PilgrimsWay, 1988&quot;, Gulner set the protagonist Dauda as a man who lived on the island of Mulberry in 1964. After the revolution, he fled to Canterbury&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(British city)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; and became a nurse in a hospital. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After living in England for many years, Dauda returned to Stone City. At the seaside, I remembered that I and my friend Bosie once sat on the pier like this, &quot;watching the sea foaming with hands and feet and gnashing teeth.&quot; I remembered that on the same day, they paddled out to sea in a small boat and enjoyed that moment &quot;like &quot;Freedom without borders&quot;, watch how the Stone City gradually becomes smaller and smaller behind you, until &quot;it seems to have turned into a beautiful mirage&quot;. At that moment, they fantasized about escaping from the narrow and twisted streets of this small town and going to the distance to find opportunities as colorful as soap bubbles. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/3f125a9a5679eec53025d346922a999f.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/3f125a9a5679eec53025d346922a999f.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;169425&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Picture of a boy diving near Stone City Pier/ICphoto&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Suddenly, the wind direction and ocean current seemed to be disturbed, and the boat started to stumble. Dauda became wary, but Bossi told him with a smile that this was just a sign that the northeast monsoon &quot;musim&quot; was blowing from the coast of India and Arabia to East Africa, while rowing the boat steadily steadily. When the sea seemed to have calmed down, Bosie explained why he could not leave his mother and daughter and go to England with Dauda, ​​and then come back to take care of them after he had established a foothold:&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style &quot;One day, these people who we have regarded and used as slaves for centuries will unite and cut the throats of those who enslaved them. To At that time, the Indians will go back to India and the Arabs will flee back to their Arabia. What about you and me? What will we do... We will be slaughtered like animals... Who will care about us? They just They will tell us that this is Africa, their Africa, even though we have lived on this land for more years than they have.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Bosi then handed the boat over to Dao As a challenge, he was asked to row the boat back to the shore and jump into the sea to swim back by himself. But the sea suddenly changed its face, and fierce hurricanes filled the entire ocean. &quot;I was struggling and beating the wooden paddle randomly,&quot; Daoda recalled, &quot;but when the storm finally calmed down, I looked around, but No more Bosie.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote data-type=&quot;2&quot; data-url=&quot;&quot; data-author-name=&quot;&quot; data-content-utf8-length=&quot;132&quot; data-source-title=&quot;&quot;>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;>;&quot;I can&#39;t find him... Bo Xi, I miss you. Even at this moment, I am still crying for you. What else can I say? The wind and tide pushed me to the north headland and pulled me ashore. I didn’t even know who I was. How did I finally get back to the shore after I tried everything possible... But Bosie, you missed the worst part. The moment I landed, I was beaten with sticks and stones.&quot;&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>; Gurner set the two endpoints of the timeline in &quot;a certain November when the northeast monsoon is about to begin as usual and merchants are about to visit East Africa again, and the slave trade is about to begin. It will be between November, when the trade of Sang Island once again reached a climax, and January 12, when the revolution of Sang Island broke out in 1964. Drag the scale back and forth between these two points, discrete and aggregate, and start over and over again. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Later, Wilson took me to a beach 40 kilometers away from the B&amp;B, where he and his family had sat and waited for hundreds of hours under the scorching sun. Beaches expecting British rescue signals and ships from Kenya. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At 10 a.m., this unnamed beach not close to Stone City and unknown to tourists is empty and quiet, with no one and no wind, and only the bright sunshine shines warmly Staring at the milky white sand made me feel dizzy after just looking at it for a little while. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;About the beach, in &quot;Farewell Memories&quot;, Gurner wrote: In the past, those slaves who refused to be slaves would come to the beach next to Stone City. , and died there. Their corpses will float on the sea together with dead branches, leaves, debris and garbage, showing the fatigue after the struggle, just like their wrinkled black skin and the broken hearts under the skin. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In addition, I wonder if the beach where Daoda frantically searched for Bosi and was beaten crazily was similar to this one? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 2005, Gurna published &quot;Escape&quot;. Like almost all his novels, it is also about &quot;wanting to escape from a foreign land that cannot be escaped, and wanting to return to a foreign land that cannot be escaped.&quot; The story of immigrants who cannot return to their hometown. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the same year, after years of struggling with his inner alter ego, Wilson finally plucked up the courage to return to Mulberry Island alone. Not long after he settled down, he met his current wife, Khadija, a girl who was almost 30 years younger than him and born and raised in Sang Island. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The afternoon after returning from the beach with Wilson, Khadija and I sat on a wicker chair by the sea, picking fresh wild spinach and preparing dinner together. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Hadija was born in the 1970s and grew up in a fisherman&#39;s home. She only had general concepts about the slave trade, colonization and revolution, and did not have many specific feelings. Wilson almost never mentioned to her those bitter memories that had been sealed for a long time and seemed to have happened yesterday. &quot;I fell in love with her simplicity, carefreeness, and no need to be entangled in the past... In short, I fell in love with her.&quot; , experiencing too much is not a good thing. Fortunately, the current generation of Sang Island has revived because of tourism. After many years, the sea is no longer just a symbol for most people. With the pain and shadow, it once again became their hope.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Wilson&#39;s emotion is still in my mind yesterday, reminding me of a passage in Gurner&#39;s book Words: &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote data-type=&quot;2&quot; data-url=&quot;&quot; data-author-name=&quot;&quot; data-content-utf8-length=&quot;129&quot; data-source-title= &quot;&quot;&quot;>; It&#39;s like I can realize that this place once belonged to me... No matter where you go here, you will be treated like one of your own family... I can still feel the generosity in her bones from this place. Nobility and palpable passion.&quot; (&quot;By the Sea&quot;, 2001) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 30 Sep 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[呼伦贝尔：一抹秋颜，油画里的童话 | 眼睛在旅游①]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257596]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-29 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 23:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
