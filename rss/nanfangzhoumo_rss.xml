Recently, some media published a report describing a female monster born in 1991. One day in July 2022, she severed ties with her relatives by deleting WeChat and blocking her phone number: List Including 3 cousins, 1 cousin, aunt, and parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The article stated that in 2022, she was fired from an Internet company in Suzhou. She suffered a cerebral infarction and a stroke the next day after drinking the break-up drink. She will need to take care of herself for at least a year. In addition to not drinking alcohol or eating high-fat foods, In addition to salty food, you also need to go to the hospital regularly to prescribe medicine, which requires a medical fee. Her parents divorced when she was 8 years old and each formed a new family. She grew up under the care of her grandmother and aunt, so she asked her closest aunt, but her aunt said it was &quot;inconvenient to bear&quot;; she also asked her father for help, hoping that every month Borrowing two to three thousand yuan from himself, her father said that he could only pay for her hospitalization expenses; she asked her mother for help, but her mother had no response. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many such reports in the media. For example, there is a report about the separation of relatives, which describes the 37-year-old Ye Wen. When he was a child, he was a left-behind child. His parents were working in Dongguan. He did not go to college. , works as a photography apprentice, opens a photography studio, likes literature, and writes worker poetry, but &quot;is not understood by his family or even his parents.&quot; He believes that his relationship with his father is broken by the word money. In 2019, he wanted to open a photography studio and borrowed 10,000 yuan from his father. His father did not speak. In his words, he was &quot;playing dead.&quot; He continued to ask: &quot;Do you want to borrow it or not? Let&#39;s talk.&quot; The father replied: &quot;I can&#39;t take care of your business.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above two cases of divorce are quite extreme. . There are two definitions or types of renunciation: one is (actively) severing contact with parents, family members and relatives, which is very clear; the other is the so-called &quot;lazy or negligent communication with relatives&quot;, which is also very clear. Vague, will be discussed further later. A common misunderstanding is to use extreme cases of the former to cover the latter, in order to exaggerate the breadth and severity of disconnection among young people. In fact, there are differences between the two situations and should be discussed separately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First discuss the above two cases and the first type of divorce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 32-year-old female Xiaoguai and the 37-year-old Ye Wen both had shortcomings in childhood: one was that her parents divorced and formed new families, and they did not raise her by their side; the other was a left-behind child when she was a child, and her parents It&#39;s pitiful that I can&#39;t be with you when I&#39;m busy working to make money. However, these two people have already grown up. As adults, how to view and deal with the relationship with their parents, family members and relatives should also be done in an adult way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are no more than two ways for adults: one is the modern way, where one is independent, has personal rights and dignity, and can take responsibility for oneself vs. other individuals who are equally independent and have boundaries; In the traditional way, everyone belongs to a big family or family, and blood is thicker than water, and family ties are important. Big families or families are natural blood communities, and have mutual financial and insurance functions. You can only choose one. Each method is equal. You will get what you pay for. No one can take anything and ask for it blindly. It cannot be said that I want all the advantages and disadvantages of both methods. That is extremely refined egoism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, Xiaoguai is 31 years old. Grandma and her aunt took care of and raised her after her parents divorced. This is not the aunt&#39;s duty, but a matter of affection. This is tradition and help from the extended family. After she became an adult, her aunt also had her own small family, and it was not unreasonable to &quot;not be able to bear&quot; her maintenance and medical expenses. Why did she have such high psychological expectations for her aunt? To have so much resentment and sever ties with my aunt after not meeting expectations? She must have been working for some years. Has she ever repaid her aunt for her kindness in raising her in the early years? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An adult who follows modern ways and does not expect to receive any help from his parents or extended family and does not maintain relationships with his parents, family members and relatives on a daily basis should be held responsible for his actions, e.g. After earning money, you should save money to prepare for emergencies; choose a healthy lifestyle and take care of your physical and mental health, because you have made up your mind to only rely on yourself. You cannot talk about personal freedom and independence when you are active and active. When you encounter trouble, you will think of your parents and extended family. In fact, after she opened her mouth to her father, he was willing to pay her hospitalization expenses as an adult and was kind to her. He just didn&#39;t meet her request to &quot;lend herself two to three thousand yuan a month.&quot; Why did she have to sever ties with her father? ? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similarly, in 2019, Ye Wen was 33 years old and borrowed 10,000 yuan from his father to open a photography studio. When his father refused to borrow the money, he severed the relationship with his father. This also caused a high psychological impact on his father. Expectations, and when expectations are not met, a lot of resentment arises. Speaking of modern methods, it is a matter of affection to be a father, but it is a duty not to be a father. In this sense, a father is the same as anyone else. If you borrow money from any friend, borrowing money from a friend is a matter of affection, but not borrowing money is a duty. Will you fall out because your friend refuses to borrow money? Doesn’t this confirm the correctness of not borrowing from friends? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, for the second type of severance, some people believe that the reason is that some young people no longer value &quot;blood relations&quot; and hate family gatherings with male elders as the core in a patriarchal society; the significance of progress It&#39;s very big, &quot;You can&#39;t choose relatives, but you can choose friends&quot;, which reflects the change from &quot;acquaintance society&quot; to &quot;stranger society&quot;. These arguments are all debatable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As mentioned above, the extended family or family is a natural blood community, which itself means that you are born with social capital (birthright). Why abandon it like worn out shoes? To a certain extent, trust based on blood and family ties is irreplaceable, and the maintenance cost of family ties is very low. If you are in the local area, you should visit regularly; if you are out of town, make a phone call or send a text message during the holidays to show yourself mind. In an era of peace and prosperity and when you are happy, these relationships may not be needed; but when facing difficulties and challenges, it is most reliable for family members to stay together and resist risks. Atomized individuals have poor ability to resist risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are two possibilities for &quot;being lazy and neglecting to interact with relatives&quot;. One is that you have essentially broken off the relationship. The problem is: you just don’t have to interact with relatives who are weird or have bad character, but you don’t have to essentially cut off contact with all relatives. Confucianism says &quot;cultivate one&#39;s moral character and bring order to one&#39;s family.&quot; People who have bad relationships with all their relatives may have problems themselves. If you are driving on the highway and find that all the cars are going the wrong way, there is only one truth: it is not others who are going the wrong way, but you. The other is just that you think so in your heart, and your parents still come forward to maintain the relationship for you while you are away from home for a long time. This is a false breakup. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can indeed choose friends, but close friends and life-and-death acquaintances are rare and require a high degree of spiritual and values ​​​​fit + deep trust established by long-term living and communication together. How many close friends, life and death friends, can a person have in a lifetime? What&#39;s more, there is no substitute for maintaining family relationships and making friends, and they can go hand in hand. Moreover, it may be difficult for those who have severed blood ties and family ties to establish deep connections and trust with people who are not even blood related, and it is also difficult for them to become trustworthy friends in the eyes of others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, the so-called &quot;stranger society&quot; does not mean to eliminate the &quot;acquaintance society&quot;, but the &quot;acquaintance society&quot; is embedded in the &quot;stranger society&quot;. The world you face is still a world with Different concentric circles, the center of the circle is yourself, and the small family and the big family wrap you up in turn. As for the term &quot;patriarchal society&quot;, it is a deconstruction of fathers, marriage and family (one of the cornerstones of civilization). Civilization domesticates men, makes them assume family responsibilities, provides resources and protection, and improves the survival ability of children. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 06 Nov 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[当“爱”已成往事]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260087]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-06 20:31:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;When a love affair turns into a marriage, a lawsuit will be filed.

This concept has been widely recognized in the scientific community, but in real life Whether people can maintain a healthy lifestyle affects people&#39;s actual physical and mental state. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, researchers from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and other institutions have studied the impact of a healthy lifestyle on people&#39;s lifespan by analyzing the genes and living habits of a large number of elderly people. It was found that people with healthy lifestyle habits tended to have a lower risk of death and longer life expectancy, even in later life. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Nature and nurture&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to data observed by the research institute, if elderly people with low genetic risk have relatively healthy lifestyle habits, they are expected to have The life expectancy may be 3.84 years longer than other people. If people with higher genetic risk have healthy living habits in their later years, the life expectancy can be 4.35 years longer. Relevant research will be published in &quot;The Lancet Healthy Longevity&quot; in October 2023. It can be seen that people with higher genetic risk benefit more by maintaining a healthy lifestyle, while those with high genetic risk but unhealthy lifestyle have the highest risk of death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Innate genetic factors and acquired social environmental factors are two basic variables that affect human health. Research on long-lived elderly people shows that the death risk of elderly people over 110 years old is relatively stable, and there is no significant correlation with genetics, living habits, age, gender and other factors. But for most people under the age of 110, genetics, age and a healthy lifestyle are all important factors that affect lifespan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on twin studies, it is estimated that about 25% of the difference in life span between people can be attributed to genetics. But in 2018, Columbia University scientist Yaniv Erlich and others analyzed the lifespan patterns of more than 10 million people through family trees and believed that the impact of genetics on lifespan may not be that great. Explains 16% of the difference, which is less than one-fifth. This shows that factors such as living environment and lifestyle may have a greater impact on people&#39;s life span. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, in order to comprehensively measure the impact of genetics, lifestyle and other factors on the life expectancy of the elderly, the latest research analyzed data from these two aspects at the same time. Relevant health data comes from the Chinese Health and Longevity Survey from 1998 to 2018, which recorded the conditions of more than 36,000 people over the age of 65. During the follow-up study period, a total of more than 27,000 people died. To compare the impact of life expectancy factors provide a reference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the definition of researchers, a healthy lifestyle generally includes four aspects, not smoking, not drinking excessively, regularly participating in physical activities, and maintaining a healthy diet. It is worth mentioning that the scope of sports activities is also very wide, not only regular exercise is recognized, but also housework, gardening, raising animals, playing cards and other activities are included in the statistics. Considering that the elderly are prone to protein deficiency, only a diet that contains high-protein foods such as meat, eggs, and fish will be defined as a healthy lifestyle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When combined with the health habits of these older adults and their longevity, the findings actually emphasize the importance of developing a healthy lifestyle. Even in old age, these habits may help increase life expectancy. However, due to limitations of the research design, the latest research cannot provide a scientific explanation of the mechanism behind this. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;It does not happen overnight&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;For the elderly, health and longevity are inseparable from a series of diseases. As aging intensifies, the incidence of many diseases, such as dementia, continues to increase. In 2022, a forecast study by the Global Burden of Disease Project estimates that the number of people suffering from dementia worldwide is likely to increase significantly from more than 57 million in 2019 to approximately 150 million in 2050, an increase of 166%. During this period, the number of sick people in China may increase from more than 15 million to more than 45 million, an increase of 197%, which is equivalent to a tripling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias are related to the cognitive ability and self-care ability of the elderly, they will not only affect the quality of life of the patients themselves and their families. Once they become lost or separated from care after the disease, It may also be life-threatening. In recent years, more and more studies have found that diseases such as dementia are also related to living habits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2023, researchers from the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Southern California used health data of nearly 50,000 elderly people to study the relationship between sedentary behavior and dementia, and found that the length of sitting is related to the onset of dementia. There is a clear link to risk, with longer periods of sitting associated with a higher risk of dementia. Compared with a median of 9.27 hours of sedentary behavior, those who sit for 12 hours a day have an increased risk of more than 60%, and if they sit for 15 hours a day, the risk more than triples. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;None of these elderly people were diagnosed with dementia at the beginning of the study. The average age was over 65 years old. They carried monitoring devices on their wrists and accurately recorded their sedentary time in subsequent years. Here, some people are diagnosed with dementia. But that doesn’t mean dementia is caused solely by sitting for long periods of time in old age. Existing scientific observations show that education, smoking, obesity, high blood sugar and other conditions may affect the risk of dementia. Lifestyle factors associated with geriatric disease can be traced back to younger ages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, psychology researchers at the University of Sussex used an observational study lasting nearly thirty years to explore the long-term health effects of symptoms such as depression and found that if people accumulate If there are too many symptoms of depression, anxiety, etc., cognitive functions will be more damaged in middle-aged and elderly people, such as poorer memory and lower accuracy of information processing. This evidence means that the relationship between some diseases may be interlocking and can induce other diseases decades apart. Not only should early detection, early intervention and early treatment be required, but also the development of healthy lifestyles should be early. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, for depression, scientists have discovered that there is a causal relationship between a healthy lifestyle and this type of disease. If you adhere to a healthy lifestyle, reduce sitting for long periods of time, increase social activities, exercise regularly, do not smoke, drink less alcohol, and maintain a healthy diet and sleep, it will help prevent depression. Research on older people has also found that developing even a hobby can help reduce people&#39;s symptoms of depression and improve their happiness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mental health diseases such as dementia and depression are just one case that affects people’s health and longevity. In reality, there are many diseases that affect people’s health. Although the pathogenic mechanisms of various diseases are mostly complex, existing Scientific evidence shows that lifestyle factors are at work behind a considerable number of diseases. In other words, by changing your lifestyle, it is possible to reduce the risk of disease and even death. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The Brutal Truth&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The latest research released by the Global Cardiovascular Risk Alliance shows that more than 50% of cardiovascular disease cases and about 20% of all-cause The deaths can be attributed to five modifiable risk factors. The five risk factors are: body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, non-HDL cholesterol, smoking and diabetes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Specifically, about 57% of cardiovascular disease cases and 22% of various death cases among women are affected by these five risk indicators, and about 53% of men are affected. % and 19%, relevant research was published in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; (NEJM) in October 2023. Modifiable risk factors serve as weather vanes. Abnormalities in a single indicator will not suddenly cause disease or death, but they can give people time to identify disease risks early and make changes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Body mass index (BMI), which can measure body fat and thinness, has been widely used in health management and disease risk prediction. Overweight and even obesity are obvious risk signals. Blood pressure and cholesterol are usually items that can be checked during a physical examination. Smoking is harmful to health, and quitting smoking as early as possible can greatly reduce the risk of disease. As for diabetes, as an important risk predictor of other cardiovascular diseases, it is a chronic disease in itself. Preventing and controlling blood sugar levels as early as possible requires developing many healthy lifestyles and persisting for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Concerning health and longevity, in recent years there have been some scientific opinions that do not seem serious enough, such as &quot;people with higher incomes live longer&quot;, &quot;people who love art live longer&quot;, etc.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, behind They all point to the issue of lifestyle affecting life span. Although these economic, social, and cultural factors, such as diet, hobbies, etc., are simple, common, and even interesting, scientific proof shows that they can all be used as environmental factors that affect life span and affect human health together with genes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, artistic hobbies affect lifespan, probably because these cultural and sports activities not only exercise the body, but also activate the brain. They also provide opportunities for social interaction, improve people&#39;s sense of happiness and belonging, and reduce It relieves loneliness, which is very rare for the elderly. An epidemiological study in Norway found that people who regularly participate in singing, dancing and other artistic activities will reduce the risk of death by more than 40%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for those with higher incomes and longer lives, the relevant evidence is more abundant, and it also confirms the widespread influence of factors such as economic and social status. Public health studies in the United States, Norway and other places have found that the life expectancy of people in the top 1% of income levels is nearly 10 years longer than those in the bottom 1%. In societies with different welfare systems and varying degrees of inequality, economic factors play surprisingly similar roles. It is a cruel truth that people with high incomes can live longer. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Developing good habits as early as possible&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is actually related to a series of healthy lifestyles. From the perspective of basic material conditions such as diet and housing, healthy diet and high-quality living environment are often more expensive and require higher income support. Medical care, services closely related to health and lifespan, and physical exercise facilities also rely on economic basis. In addition, education, income, health awareness, etc. are often related. People with higher incomes may be more aware of the importance of health, understand more health knowledge, increase exercise, and smoke less, drink less, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When these healthy lifestyles are concentrated in cities, comparative data show that people living in big cities tend to live longer overall, including low-income groups living in big cities. . Although the income is not high, they may benefit from the overall public health services, policies and health culture of large cities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the secret of longevity, the scientific community has never stopped exploring. In recent years, some preliminary findings in some animal experiments are actually related to lifestyle. Researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center observed hundreds of mice for nearly four years, the equivalent of a lifetime. In 2022, their nearly four-year study showed that dietary patterns can change the lifespan of mice, specifically reflected in the amount of food and the time of eating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Restricting 30% of the caloric intake can extend the lifespan of mice by 10%. If the caloric intake time is further restricted and eating during normal activity times according to the circadian rhythm, the lifespan can even be extended by 35%. This provides a reference for humans to understand the mechanism of longevity, and also proves the importance of a healthy lifestyle to a certain extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it should be noted that it is difficult to grasp all the information about a person’s daily life in various current studies on healthy life, especially when observing diseases and life span through the lifestyle of large-scale groups. There are many limitations, and more research is needed in the future to uncover the secrets of health and longevity. In view of the fact that some healthy behaviors also have a positive impact on people&#39;s current lives, such as regular exercise, healthy eating, and smoking and alcohol control, these recognized daily healthy behaviors are worth developing as early as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 06 Nov 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[猪心脏移植手术再次失败了]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260084]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-06 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On September 22, 2023, the University of Maryland Medical Center announced that the medical Doctors at the center transplanted a heart from a genetically modified pig into a 58-year-old heart disease patient two days ago. Within a week after the operation, the patient recovered well and was able to speak independently and sit up. One month later, doctors detected a strong immune rejection reaction in the patient. However, the latest news shows that the patient died on October 30 and did not survive longer than the first patient to receive a pig heart xenograft. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/06/fOu2F2QHapWf3QcyXUdPXmBWyk4ZdOwhI4tqYzHC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1216&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/06/fOu2F2QHapWf3QcyXUdPXmBWyk4ZdOwhI4tqYzHC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257207&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The University of Maryland Medical Center recently performed the world&#39;s second pig heart xenotransplantation. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(University of Maryland Medical Center/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Immune rejection remains the biggest threat&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;The pig heart transplanted this time came from a genetically modified pig and was provided by Revivicor, an innovative biotechnology company specializing in the cultivation of donor pigs for xenogeneic organ transplantation. It is a subsidiary of United Therapeutics Corporation. of subsidiaries. This genetically modified pig involves a total of 10 gene modifications. The main purpose is to &quot;disguise&quot; pig organs as human organs so that the human immune system cannot distinguish them, thereby reducing the body&#39;s immune rejection of foreign organs. Three of the genes were &quot;knocked out,&quot; or inactivated, to eliminate alpha galactose from the pig cells, a sugar that triggers a severe reaction in the body&#39;s immune system, leading to organ rejection. In addition, six human genes were introduced into the pig genome to improve acceptance by the human immune system, and another pig gene that controls the growth of the pig heart was modified to prevent the pig heart from continuing to overgrow after transplantation into a human. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The recipient of this xenogeneic organ transplant is 58-year-old Lawrence Faucette. According to a University of Maryland Medical Center news release, the patient had advanced heart disease and complications from peripheral vascular disease and internal bleeding that precluded a traditional heart transplant. On September 14, Fawcett was admitted to the University of Maryland Medical Center due to heart failure. Without a pig heart transplant, the patient&#39;s life may be in danger at any time. With the informed consent of the patient and his family, doctors at the center performed a pig heart xenograft surgery on Fawcett on September 20 and injected him with anti-immune rejection antibody drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The experimental xenotransplantation procedure received emergency approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#39;s (FDA) &quot;Compassionate Use&quot; program, which is designed to treat patients when no other treatments are available. Investigational treatment assistance is provided to patients at risk of death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Preliminary observation results show that the patient recovered well two days after the operation, and the implanted pig heart functioned well without any auxiliary facilities. At that time, the patient was able to speak independently, sit up in a chair, and joke. One month after the patient&#39;s surgery, the University of Maryland Medical Center released a video showing that the patient was able to stand and walk with assistance. At that time, doctors claimed that no strong immune rejection reaction had been observed yet. However, the 1-3 months after organ transplantation is the most critical period, and it is also the period when immune rejection is strongest. According to the latest statement released by the University of Maryland Medical Center, Mr. Fawcett may have died of immune rejection, but the final results are pending further announcement. Bartley Griffiths, the surgeon in charge of the transplant, said in a statement, &quot;Mr. Fawcett&#39;s final wish was that we take full advantage of what we learned from the experience.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt; strong>;The first pig heart transplant provides valuable experience&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The first clinical trial of pig heart xenotransplantation in 2022 was also conducted by Mohammad Mohideen, professor of surgery at the University of Maryland Medical Center. Muhammad M. Mohiuddin and Bartley Griffith, a 57-year-old male patient with terminal heart disease, David Bennett, was implanted with a genetically modified pig heart, also derived from Revivicor Corporation. In the first few weeks after the transplant, Bennett showed no signs of acute rejection, but 2 months after the transplant, he died suddenly of heart failure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a research paper published in the internationally renowned medical journal &quot;New England Journal of Physicians&quot; by the team of Professors Mohideen and Professor Griffith, the patient&#39;s implanted pig heart developed severe edema and increased weight. Nearly doubled, myocardial cells showed scattered necrosis, showing typical characteristics of immune rejection that are inconsistent with xenogeneic organ transplantation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a more detailed analysis published by the team in another internationally renowned medical journal, The Lancet, there may be multiple causes that may have contributed to the patient&#39;s heart failure. On the one hand, the patient&#39;s endothelium was extensively damaged, indicating that the patient was subject to strong antibody-mediated immune rejection, and his immune system was severely compromised before surgery, making him more susceptible to attack by immune system antibodies. On the other hand, patients injected with anti-rejection antibody drugs after surgery may also cause damage to myocardial cells. In addition, doctors also detected porcine cytomegalovirus/porcine roseola virus in the implanted pig hearts, which may cause transplant dysfunction. However, no spillover of pig endogenous viruses into human tissues was detected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, based on the first case of pig heart xenotransplantation, this xenotransplantation clinical trial has made some improvements, such as using more sensitive detection methods to screen pig cells for the presence of pig endogenous Viruses are used to avoid the interference of pig endogenous viruses on the transplantation function, and also to avoid potential infection of the human body by pig viruses. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;More clinical trials are needed&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The shortage of organ transplant donors is a global medical problem. According to data from the official website of organ donors in the United States, about 104,000 patients are currently registered in need of organ transplants, and more than 3,000 of them need heart transplants. However, about 17 patients die every day because they cannot wait for an organ. In 2022, more than 42,000 people received organ transplants, including more than 25,000 kidney transplants, more than 9,500 liver transplants, and more than 4,100 heart transplants. Organ donors mainly rely on volunteer donations, but problems such as the low rate of voluntary organ donation and the difficulty in matching organs have led to a serious shortage of organ donors. Since the size, function and metabolic characteristics of pig organs are similar to those of human organs, and pigs have strong reproductive capabilities and are easy to carry out genetic manipulation, and unlike primates, there are no serious ethical controversies, so pig organs are considered human organs. important substitute. In fact, pigs have long been used in human medicine, including pig skin transplants and pig heart valve implants. In recent years, scientists from China and other countries have also conducted human clinical trials of porcine islet cell xenotransplantation, which has shown good efficacy in treating type 1 diabetes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, for xenogeneic organ transplantation to be successful, it needs to withstand multiple tests such as hyperacute rejection, acute vascular rejection and cellular rejection, because there are natural barriers between different species, and the tissues of other animals It is difficult for organs to survive in the human body for a long time. With the rise of genetic modification technology, scientists suddenly realized that if they use genetic modification technology to modify the cells of organ donor animals to be close to human cells, they can hope to avoid attacks by the human immune system. Therefore, genetically modified pigs that have been genetically modified to reduce immune rejection are also considered an important option to solve the organ shortage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before human clinical trials, research on xenotransplantation was mainly carried out on animals, such as transplanting pig organs into primates such as baboons. However, because these primates still have differences with humans, There is a large difference, and the maturity level of primate organ transplantation is much lower than that of human organ transplantation. Therefore, primate xenogeneic organ transplantation trials have limited reference value for human clinical trials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to conduct clinical trials, researchers are also trying to carry out xenogeneic organ transplantation in brain-dead patients. From October to December 2021, a research team from NYU Langone Health announced that they had successfully transplanted genetically modified pig kidneys produced by Revivicor into two people who were brain dead and relied on ventilators to maintain physical signs. in the patient&#39;s body. After more than two days of observation, the researchers found that the genetically modified pig&#39;s kidneys not only continued to filter waste and produce urine at a normal rate, but also restored the patient&#39;s abnormal creatinine levels caused by poor kidney function to normal levels, while during the observation period No severe rejection was observed either. Although this clinical trial was only conducted on brain-dead patients, the genetically modified pig kidneys could function normally in vitro and did not cause severe rejection. This is a great encouragement for the upcoming clinical trials of xenogeneic organ transplantation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the current two pig heart xenotransplantation patients have only survived for two months or less, the doctors, patients and their families in this clinical trial do not have high expectations for the clinical effects. In a sense, these brave early patients provided valuable experience for the clinical application of xenogeneic organ transplantation. For example, the results of the first xenotransplantation operation showed that the hearts of genetically modified pigs can function normally when the human immune system is fully suppressed, which established confidence for subsequent human clinical trials. In addition, the first xenogeneic organ transplant also discovered some factors that easily cause immune rejection and some potential safety risks, which can be avoided and eliminated in subsequent clinical trials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xenogeneic organ transplantation is undoubtedly a highly innovative and risky new therapy. Only by conducting more human clinical trials can problems be discovered in real human clinical trials and xenogeneic transplantation can be continuously improved. Organ transplant surgery-related procedures eliminate potential risks and continuously improve the patient&#39;s post-operative survival time and quality. It is expected that pig organs will eventually survive long-term and healthy in the human body, bringing good news to patients who cannot wait for human organs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 06 Nov 2023 19:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[最高法再审百亿金海矿山案，山西前首富张新明败诉]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260044]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-06 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;After the integration of coal resources in Shanxi began in 2009, the Jinhai Coal Mine was retained separately, and the market price soared. to 10 billion yuan.

Visual China/Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Shanxi “Ten Billion Mine Contest Case” that once shocked the legal community has taken a major turn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;17 years ago, Zhang Xinming, the former richest man in Shanxi and chairman of Jinye Group, and his related parties transferred their shares in Jinhai Coal Mine to the state-owned Shanxi Coal Transportation and Marketing Group Jincheng Yangcheng Co., Ltd. in order to alleviate their financial difficulties. (hereinafter referred to as Yangcheng Coal Transportation) and Qinhe Investment Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Qinhe Investment) headed by Lu Zhonglou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, as the Shanxi coal industry began to merge and reorganize in 2009, the value of Jinhai coal mine soared sharply. Zhang Xinming began to launch a series of lawsuits against Yangcheng Coal Transportation, Qinhe Investment and its chairman Lu Zhonglou. When the plaintiff transferred the equity to the defendant, the price was too low. Zhang Xinming won all these lawsuits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jinhai Coal Mine is located in Yangcheng County, Jincheng City, Shanxi Province. The coalfield area is about 53.7 square kilometers and the total resource reserves are 409 million tons. It is extremely rare in Shanxi, where coal mines are everywhere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The verdicts of this series of cases have caused huge controversy, and the fates of two coal tycoons, Zhang Xinming and Lu Zhonglou, have also taken different paths. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xinming is known as the &quot;Minister of Shanxi Underground Organization&quot;. In August 2014, Zhang Xinming was taken away by the public security organs in Taiyuan, and there has been no news since. Shanxi&#39;s officialdom also experienced constant earthquakes, and officials were dismissed one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, three of the above-mentioned series of lawsuits were heard by the Supreme People&#39;s Court of the People&#39;s Republic of China (hereinafter referred to as the Supreme Court) and the Shanxi Provincial Higher People&#39;s Court (hereinafter referred to as the Shanxi Provincial High Court), and the original judgments were revoked. Another case upheld the original verdict. Zhang Xinming, who had &quot;disappeared&quot; for more than nine years, also returned to the stage due to the reopening of these cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2023, Yangcheng Coal Transportation and Zhang Xinming’s son Zhang Wenyang were retried over the equity dispute in Jinhai Coal Mine. Zhang Xinming appeared at the court hearing as his son’s litigation agent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Informed sources revealed to Southern Weekend reporters that Zhang Xinming will be released from prison on medical parole in mid-2020, and the relevant judgment will be kept confidential. In a photo in May 2020, 57-year-old Zhang Xinming was sitting in a wheelchair, dressed casually and looking relaxed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the old and new judgments, a multi-party battle to grab the ore can be recreated. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Ten-billion mining case and the sacking of the Vice President of the Supreme People’s Court&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2004, Zhang Xinming obtained the mining rights of Jinhai Coal Mine and established Shanxi Jinhai Energy Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Jinhai) Energy), with a registered capital of 30 million yuan. Except for obtaining the mining license of Jinhai Coal Mine on March 15 of that year, the company has not conducted other investments and operations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, coal resources in Shanxi were still allocated administratively, and were either used free of charge by enterprises, or some symbolic resource fees were paid. This means that in a short period of time, those who obtain new mines can make huge profits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The mineral resource fee of Jinhai Coal Mine totals 224 million yuan (0.55 yuan/ton), which is paid in six years. In May 2004, Jinhai Energy paid the first installment of 37.3849 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2005, Jinhai Energy was short of funds and began to introduce external investors. At that time, Zhang Xinming and his related natural persons held 60% of the shares in Jinhai Energy, and Beijing Xinye Investment Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Beijing Xinye) held 40% of the shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of the above 60% shares&lt;span>;, Zhang Xinming holds 17%, his son Zhang Wenyang holds 40%, Feng Xiaolin holds 2%, and Wang Xiangdong holds 1%. &lt;/span>;Zhang Wenyang and Feng Xiaolin once stated during the trial that they were both acting on behalf of Zhang Xinming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Finance&quot; magazine once reported that Wang Xiangdong is the son of a former main leader of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee. People familiar with the case also confirmed this to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The original executive director and legal representative of Beijing Xinye is the mysterious Shanxi businessman Yan Qi. According to Caijing magazine, Yan Qi was originally a student of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Materials and Materials, and later founded Shanxi Yunchang Real Estate Company. He has never been involved in coal mining during his career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yan Qi later founded Sanya Luhuitou Tourist Area Development Co., Ltd. and developed the famous villa market &quot;Banshan Peninsula&quot;. Its subsidiaries also include Sanya Aidi Real Estate Company and Hong Kong Tianfu Company. &lt;span>;In 2015, Yan Qi ranked as the richest man in Hainan on the Hurun Rich List with assets of 9 billion yuan. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2005, Jinhai Energy and Yangcheng Coal Transportation signed an equity transfer agreement. Zhang Wenyang and Beijing Xinye transferred 13% and 15% of their equity respectively, and Yangcheng Coal Transportation paid for these equity A transfer price of 8.4 million yuan was obtained, which is equivalent to 300,000 yuan per share, which is the same as the registered capital price per share. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, Yangcheng Coal Transportation provided entrusted loans of 280 million yuan each to the Yuefeng Coal Washing Plant under Beijing Xinye and Jinye Group (Zhang Xinming is the chairman), with a term of 6 years, and the interest is based on bank deposit interest rates for the same period. calculate. After obtaining 28% of the equity of Jinhai Coal Mine, Yangcheng Coal Transportation paid another 74.76 million yuan in resource price, and Jinhai Energy’s mining rights were extended. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2007, Jinhai Energy also acquired Qinhe Investment from Lu Zhonglou as a shareholder. In September of that year, six shareholders of Jinhai Energy signed an equity transfer agreement with Qinhe Investment. Zhang Xinming, Zhang Wenyang, Feng Xiaolin, and Beijing Xinye transferred 17%, 27%, 2%, and 15% of their equity respectively to Qinhe Investment. The latter paid an equity transfer fee of 18.3 million yuan, which is also 300,000 yuan per share. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, Qinhe Investment also provided a 5-year interest-free loan of 375 million yuan to Beijing Xinye, and signed a loan agreement with Zhang Xinming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Beijing Xinye transferred its equity to Qinhe Investment, the two parties signed a supplementary agreement to change the transfer price of 15% of Beijing Xinye’s equity from 4.5 million yuan to 200 million yuan. It was previously agreed that The 375 million yuan loan lapsed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2009, 1% of Wang Xiangdong’s equity was transferred to Qinhe Investment for 300,000 yuan. At this point, the shareholders of Jinhai Energy have become Qinhe Investment, Yangcheng Coal Transportation and Beijing Xinye, with each of the three parties holding 62%, 28% and 10% of the shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this time, Shanxi coal resources began to merge and reorganize, but Jinhai Coal Mine was retained alone, and the market price soared to tens of billions of yuan. According to the above report, in the first half of 2009, Zhang Xinming repeatedly persuaded Lu Zhonglou to sell 62% of the Jinhai Coal Mine equity for 900 million yuan, but Lu disagreed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, Zhang Xinming began to sue Qinhe Investment and requested to terminate the equity transfer agreement on the grounds that the value of each equity share of Jinhai Coal Mine was much greater than 300,000 yuan. The lawsuit went all the way to the Supreme Court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The Supreme Court quoted the supplementary agreement between Beijing Xinye and Qinhe Investment, a non-party in the case, and considered that the transfer price of 15% of Jinhai Energy held by Beijing Xinye was changed to 200 million yuan, and held that Qinhe Investment changed from Zhang The market value of the 46%&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; equity transferred by Xinming Division should exceed&lt;/span>; 600 million yuan. The amount paid by Qinhe Investment was &quot;significantly lower than the market value of the equity involved in the case&quot;, and accordingly the original trial was upheld. The court supported Zhang Xinming’s request to terminate the contract, transfer Qin and return the equity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The case was judged in September 2012, and the case number was &quot;(2011) Minerzhongzi No. 76&quot;, also known as &quot;Judgment No. 76&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This verdict caused huge controversy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2013, two seminars on the &quot;Judgment No. 76&quot; were held in Beijing. More than 30 civil and commercial law scholars, including jurist Jiang Ping, professor of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Liang Huixing, and professor of China University of Political Science and Law Li Shuguang, attended discuss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liang Huixing said at the above-mentioned seminar that if coal prices did not rise, there would be no case. He believes that &quot;the Supreme Court made a judgment based on the principle of fairness, which is wrong.&quot; Since both parties are businessmen, the agreement between the two parties is fair. As long as it does not violate the law or harm the interests of the country and society, the court has no power to intervene. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The then Vice President of the Supreme People&#39;s Court&lt;span>;Xi Xiaoming also compiled the case into the book &quot;Supreme People&#39;s Court Commercial Trial Guidance Cases (2012) Company and Finance&quot;&lt;/span>;. In July 2015, Xi Xiaoming was investigated for suspected serious violations of discipline and law, and was eventually accused of accepting a huge financial bribe of 114 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to &quot;Caixin&quot; reports, Zhang Xinming paid 30 million yuan in bribes to Xi Xiaoming through a broker, of which 18 million yuan was given to Xi Xiaoming&#39;s son Xi Jiacheng, and the remaining 12 million yuan belonged to Xi Xiaoming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Judgment No. 76&quot; is the final judgment of the Supreme People&#39;s Court. If you are not satisfied with the judgment, Qinhe Investment can also apply for a protest to the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate. Lu Zhonglou told Southern Weekend reporters that Qinhe Investment is preparing to apply for a protest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the &quot;Judgment No. 76&quot;, from 2010 to 2012, related parties such as Yangcheng Coal Transportation, Qinhe Investment and Lu Zhonglou were also sued by Zhang Xinming and his associates, Beijing Xinye The lawsuit was filed, all demanding that the Jinhai Coal Mine Equity Transfer Agreement be terminated and that all parties return their equity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, there are 4 cases that were retried this time. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Restart&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Another person close to the Jinhai Coal Mine Equity Dispute case told Southern Weekend reporters that there has been no movement in this series of lawsuits for 10 years. He suddenly got the lawsuit at the end of 2022. It is known that the case will be restarted. After the spring of 2023, the pace of the trial will gradually slow down and return to a normal pace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2023, Yangcheng Coal Transportation received two final judgments one after another, from the Supreme People&#39;s Court and the Shanxi Provincial High Court, and the signing dates were September 7 and September 18, 2023 respectively. The original judgments were all revoked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2011 and 2012, Zhang Wenyang and Beijing Xinye took Yangcheng Coal Transportation to court. They argued that the 28% equity transferred by Jinhai Energy to Yangcheng Coal Transportation included a loan principal of 560 million yuan. , please rule that the equity transfer agreement between the two parties is invalid and return the equity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The Shanxi Provincial High Court and Shanxi Jincheng Intermediate Court, the original courts of the two cases, both cited &quot;Judgment No. 76&quot; and held that Jinhai Energy&#39;s &quot;transfer price of 300,000 yuan per share was not between the parties to the agreement.&quot; True meaning &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&quot;, &lt;/span>; thereby supporting Zhang Wenyang and Beijing Xinye. Yangcheng Coal Transport was dissatisfied and appealed to the Supreme Court and Shanxi Provincial High Court respectively. Since then, there has been no progress in the two cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The Supreme People’s Court and the Shanxi Provincial High Court, which were responsible for the final review this time, believed that the entire transfer consideration of the 28% stake in Jinhai Energy involved included both the 8.4 million yuan clearly agreed in the transfer agreement and Zhang Xinming’s Fang used the business interests of 560 million yuan for 6 years through entrusted loans at low interest rates. Therefore, the original judgment was revoked and the validity of the equity transfer agreement was recognized. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The core requirement of the market economy legal system is the protection of property rights. These two judgments demonstrate the Supreme Court’s respect for the order of market transactions and the expression of the will of market entities.” Yangcheng Coal Transportation Lawyer Hu Xiaoyong told Southern Weekend reporters. He has taken over the equity dispute between Yangcheng Coal Transportation and Zhang Xinmingfang since 2012. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Commercial interests can be understood as opportunity value.” Hu Xiaoyong explained that Zhang Xinming obtained the opportunity value of using hundreds of millions of yuan of funds at low interest rates for 6 years, and then used it to invest in other real estate projects, thereby obtaining huge commercial interests. . These commercial interests together constitute the equity transfer price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On September 18, 2023&lt;/span>;, the Supreme People’s Court also made a final judgment on Beijing Xinye’s lawsuit against Qinhe Investment, revoking the original judgment and supporting some of Qinhe Investment’s requests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 2011&lt;/span>;, Beijing Xinye sued Qinhe Investment, saying that the two parties agreed that Qinhe Investment would transfer 15% of the equity transfer money to Beijing Xinye in the form of a loan, totaling 375 million yuan, 25 million yuan per share. &lt;span>;Beijing Xinye changed the equity information to the name of Qinhe Investment as promised&lt;/span>; Qinhe Investment only paid 200 million yuan, leaving 175 million yuan unpaid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beijing Xinye believed that Qinhe Investment constituted a fundamental breach of contract, and requested the first instance judgment to terminate the equity transfer agreement and the loan agreement between the two parties, and to allow the latter to return the equity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the trial of the case, Yan Qi, the legal representative of Beijing Xinye, denied that he had signed a supplementary agreement with Qinhe Investment, that is, the equity transfer amount was changed from 4.5 million yuan to 200 million yuan, and also reported to the police that he had signed a supplementary agreement with Qinhe Investment. The agreement was &quot;forged.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first-instance judgment of the Shanxi Provincial High Court also quoted &quot;Judgment No. 76&quot; and stated that &quot;Judgment No. 76&quot; and the 15% shares involved in the above-mentioned case &quot;were based on the same background, at the same shareholder meeting, at the same time.&quot; , changed at the same time with the same price per share&quot;, it is believed that &quot;the equity transfer price of 300,000 yuan per share is obviously low.&quot; In the end, it was ruled that the agreement was invalid and Qinhe Investment returned its equity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qinhe Investment was dissatisfied with the above-mentioned first-instance judgment and appealed to the Supreme Court. On May 29, 2013, the Supreme People&#39;s Court formed a collegial panel to hear the case, but nothing happened. In January 2023, the Supreme People’s Court heard the case again after the change of the collegial bench. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This time, the Supreme People’s Court accepted the supplementary agreement and determined that Qinhe Investment should pay Beijing Xinye the equity transfer price of 200 million yuan. It was finally recognized that Qinhe Investment had paid 147.265 million yuan for the equity transfer, corresponding to all 11.044875% of the equity, and the court ordered Qinhe Investment to return the remaining 3.955125% equity to Beijing Xinye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Basically fair.” Ji Jingwu, attorney for Qinhe Investment, told Southern Weekend reporters, but the judgment is still unsatisfactory. In his view, Beijing Xinye had admitted in the first instance that Qinhe Investment had paid 200 million yuan for the equity transfer, so Qinhe Investment no longer needed to prove this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On this basis, Ji Jingwu believed that &lt;span>; Beijing Xinye’s lawsuit on the grounds that Qinhe Investment failed to perform the loan agreement cannot be established, and the court should dismiss Beijing Xinye’s lawsuit in accordance with the law. The current judgment results in changing its litigation claims. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Empty the cage and change the bird&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;There is still one retrial to uphold the original verdict, which is also the earliest verdict among the four retrial cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On March 12, 2009, Wang Xiangdong, a shareholder of Jinhai Energy, signed a letter of authorization entrusting Yan Qi to handle the transfer of Jinhai Energy&#39;s equity interests. Yan Qi has served as the legal representative of Beijing Xinye and Jinhai Energy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 9 of that year, Yan Qi signed an equity transfer agreement with Qinhe Investment on behalf of Wang Xiangdong, stipulating that Wang Xiangdong would transfer 1% of the equity he held to Qinhe Investment for a price of 300,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In November 2011, Wang Xiangdong took Qinhe Investment to court. The reason was that the equity transfer price was too low. Please terminate the transfer agreement and return the equity. The case went through two trials, and the Shanxi Provincial High Court of the second instance upheld the original verdict on September 27, 2012, supporting Wang Xiangdong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Xiangdong acknowledged the authenticity of the power of attorney during the trial, but said he had no knowledge of the equity transfer and did not agree to transfer equity worth more than 20 million yuan with a registered capital value of 300,000 yuan. transfer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both courts of both instances held that the equity transfer price of 300,000 yuan was significantly lower than the transfer price that Yan Qi and Qinhe Investment knew of, and both parties transferred Wang Xiangdong’s equity at an obviously too low price without Wang Xiangdong’s consent. equity, harming its interests, and the behavior of Yan Qi and Qinhe Investment constituted malicious collusion. Qinhe Investment was dissatisfied and applied to the Supreme Court for retrial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main basis for the court of first instance to judge that Yan Qi knew that the equity transfer price was too low was the supplementary agreement signed between Beijing Xinye and Qinhe Investment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 28, 2023, the Supreme People’s Court made a final judgment on the case, still based on the supplementary agreement, and determined that 1% of Jinhai Energy’s equity would exceed 13 million yuan. Yan Qi and Qinhe Investment jointly Wang Xiangdong&#39;s rights and interests were damaged and the original verdict was upheld. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Ji Jingwu’s view, the case between Wang Xiangdong and Qinhe Investment is the simplest in the series of lawsuits over Jinhai Coal Mine equity disputes. “Does such a simple case need to be tried for 10 years?”&lt;/p>; &lt; p>; He believes that Wang Xiangdong entrusted Yan Qi with full authority to handle the equity transfer, so the equity transfer agreement signed by Yan Qi on behalf of Wang Xiangdong and Qinhe Investment did not exceed the agency authority. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, before the judgment of this case, the authenticity of the supplementary agreement had not been recognized by any court. Secondly, even if the agreement is genuine, the court determined that the equity transfer price in this case was low and unreasonable based on an agreement between a party outside the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I wonder if the disputes between shareholders can stop here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, after reexamination, the equity structure of Jinhai Energy has become: Zhang Xinmingfang 46%, Yangcheng Coal Transportation 28%, Beijing Xinye 13.955125%, Qinhe Investment 11.044875%, and Wang Xiangdong 1%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Jinhai Coal Mine, which was supposed to shine, has been in a state of stagnation over the years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 2021 coal mine classification list released by the Office of the Work Safety Committee of the Shanxi Provincial People&#39;s Government shows that Jinhai Coal Mine is a Class D coal mine, that is, a coal mine that has been suspended for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Jinhai Coal Mine may have new progress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2021, Jinhai Coal Mine appeared in the list of the first batch of projects released by Shanxi Provincial state-owned enterprises in 2021. The provincial state-owned enterprise is Jinneng Holding Group Co., Ltd.

Photo courtesy of People’s Vision&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 31, 2023, the Central Financial Work Conference concluded, and the concept of &quot;financial power&quot; was proposed for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;If the finance is not strong, the blood is not connected.&quot; Zhang Zhanbin, director of the Chinese Modernization Research Center of the Central Party School (National Academy of Administration), told Southern Weekend reporters that the &quot;financial power&quot; is This concept was first proposed at the Central Financial Work Conference, reflecting the urgency of financial work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The name of the meeting is &quot;Central Financial Work Conference&quot;, which reflects the central government&#39;s great importance to financial work. The last time a high-profile meeting in the financial field was held was in 2017. The meeting was called the &quot;National Financial Work Conference&quot; and was attended by five members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau. This time, all seven members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau attended, and relevant statements such as &quot;the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee on financial work must be upheld&quot; appeared four times in the meeting draft. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Not only the financial work conference, Southern Weekend reporters found that since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the National Political and Legal Work Conference, the National United Front Work Conference, the National Urban Work Conference, The National Talent Work Conference and others have been upgraded to work conferences held in the name of the central government. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Ruan Siyu, director of the Department of Political Science and Administration at South China Normal University, has long studied conference politics. In his opinion, the original national work conferences were generally within the system. The meeting was upgraded to a working meeting held in the name of the central government, which reflected the importance of the Party Central Committee in this field and facilitated the strengthening of centralized and unified leadership. &quot;Many problems cannot be solved within the department.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Weak financial supervision and governance capabilities&quot; &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In In economic development, finance plays the role of “bloodline”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Zhanbin believes that major cases in the financial field are occurring frequently, financial supervision still has problems, the financial system still needs to be improved, and financial security and stability need to be maintained to prevent them from happening. The bottom line of systemic risks, &quot;Compared with the blueprint for financial power, the gap is reflected in &quot;many problems cannot be solved within the department&quot;.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Central Financial Work Conference clearly pointed out that “various contradictions and problems in the financial field are intertwined and influence each other, and some are very prominent, and hidden economic and financial risks are still relatively high. The quality and efficiency of financial services to the real economy are not high, financial chaos and corruption problems persist, and financial supervision and governance capabilities are weak.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As early as March 2023 In September, the &quot;Party and State Institutional Reform Plan&quot; issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council proposed the establishment of the Central Financial Commission and the Central Financial Working Committee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Central Financial Work Conference pointed out that it is necessary to improve the system and mechanism of the party&#39;s leadership in financial work, give full play to the role of the Central Financial Commission and the Central Financial Working Committee, and implement territorial responsibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Zhang Zhanbin&#39;s view, this reflects the central government&#39;s determination to lead financial work and helps eliminate the blind pursuit of local interests in economic development, while Some practices that ignore the overall interests of the country and the overall benefits of society. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Short meeting time, long preparation time&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For the whole country The Financial Work Conference was upgraded to the Central Financial Work Conference. Ruan Siyu’s understanding is that the former is usually organized by a ministry or commission of the State Council, while the latter is under the guidance of the central organization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the National Political and Legal Work Conference was first upgraded to the Central Political and Legal Work Conference in 2014. Since then, the National United Front Work Conference, the National Urban Work Conference, The National Talent Work Conference and others have been upgraded one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Ruan Siyu&#39;s view, the upgrade of the meeting not only reflects the importance that the Party Central Committee attaches to a certain field, but also makes the coordination between the Party Central Committee and local party committees smoother at the practical level. Many issues &quot;require the party committee to come forward and advance them as a whole.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Take talent work as an example. In 2021, the &quot;National Talent Work Conference&quot; will be upgraded to the &quot;Central Talent Work Conference&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The meeting called for improving the talent work pattern in which the party committee leads the unified leadership, the organizational department takes the lead in grasping the overall situation, functional departments perform their respective duties and cooperate closely, and social forces participate extensively. Government departments at all levels including education, science and technology, industry and information technology, security, human resources and social security, culture and tourism, state-owned assets, finance, foreign affairs, etc., give full play to their functions and work together to implement various tasks of talent work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the past, some departments did not have a starting point to carry out talent work. Organizational departments focused on talent work, but social security issues need to be solved by the human resources and social security departments. If teachers are introduced, they cannot do without it. Education sector policies. Ruan Siyu believes that after the Party Central Committee and local party committees attach great importance to it and require all departments to do a good job in talent issues, the enthusiasm and initiative of each department have been improved, and &quot;there is more space.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In terms of meeting procedures, the working meeting convened in the name of the central government &quot;the meeting time is very short, but the preparation for the meeting is very long&quot;, and the research on relevant issues is relatively mature. There are clear instructions on future development directions and reform ideas. Most national work conferences only involve policy briefings, work summaries and task assignments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the work conference convened in the name of the central government, all-round publicity will be carried out at the national level. At the same time, the Discipline Inspection and Supervision Commission will also carry out the implementation of the party’s line, principles and policies. Carry out patrol inspections. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition to the upgrade of national work conferences, some meetings that had not been held before were also held in the name of the central government after the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2019, the Party Central Committee convened the Central Committee of the Chinese People&#39;s Political Consultative Conference Working Conference, and two years later, the Central People&#39;s Congress Working Conference was held. This was the first time in the history of the Communist Party of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 06 Nov 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[福原爱或面临2年以上监禁：抚养权的归属应以有利于孩子成长为原则丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260062]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-06 15:05:14&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The love affair and marriage changes of Fukuhara Ai and Taiwanese Jiang Hongjie have always attracted widespread media attention. Currently, due to a criminal complaint filed by her ex-husband with the police, &quot;Ai Fukuhara may face more than 2 years in prison&quot;, which has triggered a lot of discussion on social media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mainland netizens have always had a good impression of Fukuhara Ai. She is cute, fluent in Chinese, and her Northeastern dialect, which tastes like corn pancakes, is very friendly. After Fukuhara Ai&#39;s affair and marriage change, many mainland netizens still regard themselves as &quot;family members&quot; and are willing to speak for her. This has led to a very interesting phenomenon: At present, Fukuhara Ai&#39;s public opinion image in Japan and Taiwan is relatively negative, but in mainland China it is still positive. This is probably the power of true love. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fukuhara Ai was born in 1988. He started playing table tennis at the age of 3. He was once the main player of the Japanese national team and participated in many Olympic Games. He is perhaps the most popular Japanese athlete among the Chinese people. Jiang Hongjie is a table tennis player on the Taipei team. The two officially announced their marriage in September 2016. They gave birth to a daughter in 2017 and a boy in 2019. They announced their divorce in July 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the marriage change, some Japanese media reported that Fukuhara Ai looked happy on the surface, but in fact she had silently endured years of verbal violence from her husband and his family; her husband’s family also treated her as a cash cow. The information read from it is that Jiang Hongjie&#39;s family &quot;eat soft food&quot; and are not grateful. At that time, public opinion was overwhelmingly sympathetic to Fukuhara Ai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, things soon took a turn for the worse. During her marriage, Ai Fukuhara was photographed by the media having a very intimate behavior with a married man, and they went to a hotel to spend the night together. At that time, she did not admit that she had cheated on her, saying that the other person was her good friend and they lived in the same room. After the divorce, Fukuhara Ai and the man openly fell in love. Then, the man&#39;s ex-wife came out and complained that their divorce was due to the intervention of a third party by Ai Fukuhara. This caused the persona and image that Ai Fukuhara had worked so hard to cultivate to suddenly collapse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Frankly speaking, Jiang Hongjie and his family have verbally despised and insulted Ai Fukuhara, treating her as a tool to make money. Outsiders have no way of confirming the truth and can only have a different opinion. However, Ai Fukuhara was later caught cheating and lying, which became a real evidence, which lowered the credibility of these revelations. Many people will speculate that these so-called revelations are because they have a new love, and in order to reduce the moral pressure and public criticism of their marriage, they deliberately feed it to the media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, when Fukuhara Ai was exposed to have cheated on her, her mother was still at Jiang Hongjie’s house and returned to Japan soon thereafter. Media reports stated that the mother decided to return to Japan because she felt she had no position and was embarrassed to stay any longer. Later, her mother even refused to live with Fukuhara Ai, indicating that she had objections to her cheating and divorce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 27 this year, Jiang Hongjie held a press conference in Japan and said: Due to the complete loss of contact with Fukuhara Ai, he has not seen his children for a year. Previously, Fukuhara Ai secretly brought her son back to Japan from Taiwan on the pretext of visiting. Jiang Hongjie announced: &quot;I have something to report. I received the judgment result from the Japanese court on July 20. The content is the court&#39;s order requiring Miss Fukuhara Ai to deliver the child to me. I am very grateful for the Japanese court&#39;s judgment and hope to hurry up.&quot; Meet the children.&quot; Fukuhara Ainori stated through her lawyer: The Japanese court&#39;s ruling is only a temporary sanction and not a final judgment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, more than two months have passed and the matter has not been resolved, so Jiang Hongjie took further legal action. According to the Japanese Criminal Code, there is the crime of &quot;abduction and abduction of minors&quot; (Article 224), and the perpetrators may be sentenced to not less than three months and not more than seven years of hard labor; there is the crime of &quot;abduction and abduction for the purpose of transfer abroad&quot; (Article 226), Seizing and abducting people abroad may result in a sentence of not less than 2 years of hard labor. This has nothing to do with whether the perpetrator is a relative or whether it is for profit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, Jiang Hongjie’s purpose is to get his son back, not to put Fukuhara Ai in jail. How this matter develops remains to be seen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are two direct interpretations of this matter. First, the concept of rule of law in Japanese society is quite strong. The court ruled that it respects the merits and legal principles of the matter, neither conciliates nor acknowledges the fait accompli, nor does it favor Fukuhara Ai because she is a Japanese national. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, the family values ​​and moral concepts in Japanese society are quite strong. Public opinion has a low tolerance for marital infidelity and lies. It’s okay to complain that your marriage is unhappy and that you want to pursue freedom and true love, but please wait until you’re divorced before talking about it. If a public figure cheats on his wife and lies to the public, after the cheating is confirmed and the lie is exposed, the backlash and recoil will be considerable, and his persona, image and career will be greatly affected. Influence. In the eyes of the public, on the basis of these criminal records, secretly taking the child away from the father and refusing to comply with the court&#39;s order is morally and legally unreasonable, and it is difficult to empathize and sympathize with him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A further thought is: Even if we promise each other before marriage, some marriages will always break down, and if there are children, they will often involve custody battles. If one party wants the other party not, this is easy to handle and can be solved through a divorce agreement. It is more difficult to handle whether both parties want it or neither wants it. There have been cases in China where couples wanted to divorce, but neither wanted custody of their children, and then the court refused to allow the divorce. The worst among them was the children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both parties want the custody of their children, but the agreement cannot resolve the matter, and it finally goes to court. How should the court decide? Of course, the child&#39;s wishes should be considered and which party he wants to be with. However, if the child cannot express his wishes when he is very young, or the wishes expressed by the child may not be in his or her best interests, how will the court consider this? It is still necessary to consider which parent&#39;s custody is most beneficial to the child&#39;s physical and mental health and growth, and the interests of adult men and women cannot be placed above the interests of the child. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One party has better economic conditions, educational background, and a legitimate and stable career, which should be an advantage. Because children living with such a father or mother will not only get better care in life, but the adults themselves are also good role models and can teach children better family education through precepts and deeds, especially values ​​education, which is more conducive to children&#39;s good health. The development of character. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If one party makes a major mistake during the divorce process, violates morality or the law, and shows problems with personal values ​​and character, then the child&#39;s values ​​may be distorted by living with such an adult. Few people face up to their mistakes, so when they make major mistakes, they either distort the facts and give their children a wrong version of the narrative, or they distort the standards for judging right and wrong, which are values, for example, beautifying one&#39;s own infidelity as the supremacy of true love. No matter what kind of situation, it is detrimental to the growth of the child, or it may make the child hate adults who are not at fault, or it may make the child&#39;s mind and values ​​​​very different from ordinary people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, if the court must determine the ownership of child custody, the principle that is most conducive to the child&#39;s growth should be established, and the child should be allowed to stay with the adult who loves him/her the most, and should not condone the struggle for custody. In order to fight for a larger share of property, or to fight for custody rights as a means of revenge on the other half. Children should be the purpose, not the tool. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 06 Nov 2023 15:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[新鲜白菜凑厨余？垃圾不仅要分，更要减]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260032]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-06 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/11/06/3adc4c0617.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;809&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/ 06/3adc4c0617.png&quot; data-key=&quot;257159&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 31, witnesses saw a piece of garbage on the streets of Zhongguancun At the bucket station, sanitation workers unpack fresh cabbage and chop it into pieces to collect food waste.

It actually reflects the difficulty of waste classification management in reaching the responsibility of waste generators.&quot; Liu Jianguo said that waste classification is a grassroots social governance that involves thousands of households. Work is essentially about people, not garbage.

The cabbage has become food waste, and its value has tripled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Different levels of economic development in different regions place different emphasis on waste classification. Some subsidize based on the number of barrels, while others, like Beijing, subsidize kitchen waste based on the tonnage. The subsidy level of 1,700 yuan/ton is relatively high in the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, the &quot;Regulations&quot; implemented in 2020 only mention that Beijing will formulate incentive policies, without mentioning the amount. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Operation and maintenance companies like Beijing Luxin are actually third-party services purchased by the government. In addition to secondary sorting of food waste, there are other tasks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For example, on September 25, 2023, Wangjing Street, Chaoyang District announced the winning bid for third-party garbage classification services in 2023-2024. The total winning transaction amount was 5.58 million. Yu Yuan, Party B&#39;s organizer shall be responsible for collecting kitchen waste, ensuring the purity of kitchen waste, and re-sorting mixed garbage that is not put in according to specifications; Party B shall also be responsible for cleaning the trash cans and establishing a renewable resource recycling system; cooperate Local communities and properties carry out garbage classification work and accept government inspections and assessments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The original intention of the waste classification subsidy and food waste sorting rate system is good, encouraging companies to better complete waste classification work, but policymakers may We didn’t expect companies to ‘take shortcuts’.” Lan Yajun said, “If a company fails to meet the assessment targets, not only may it be difficult to obtain subsidies, but it may also be criticized by local competent authorities, which will affect subsequent contract signings. The competent authorities may also have to bear the responsibility. Responsibility for poor supervision.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Not only do companies have indicators, the government also has assessment pressure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The official WeChat ID of the Haidian District Urban Management Committee &quot;Haidian City Affairs&quot; shows that the district&#39;s domestic waste classification work leading group has assessed the waste classification work of each street and town. Announcement and ranking of red, yellow and green lists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Taking February 2023 as an example, Zhongguancun Street ranked third on the yellow list with a score of 77.76, ranking 11th on the entire list, and belongs to the upper-middle level of Haidian District . Southern Weekend reporters noticed that in Beijing’s Haidian District, in addition to comparing the effectiveness of garbage classification among streets, communities also compete for the top spot, and those who perform well will be publicly praised. Similar evaluations can be found in major cities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the assessment of Haidian District, Beijing, the food waste separation rate accounted for 10 points out of a total of 100. It is worth noting that Southern Weekend reporters did not find specific assessment indicators for Beijing’s food waste separation rate from public information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/06/88286f46cd.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;886&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/06/88286f46cd.png&quot; data-key=&quot;257162&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On March 14, 2023, the Haidian District Urban Management Committee released relevant information on garbage classification assessment on the official WeChat ID &quot;Haidian City Affairs&quot;. Screenshot of official account. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the domestic waste assessment methods announced across the country, there are almost no specific requirements for the food waste sorting rate. Most of them are based on comprehensive performance assessment, but In actual work, some regions have specific requirements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Jianguo told Southern Weekend reporters that the assessment indicator set by Beijing is around 18%. The above-mentioned bidding announcement of Wangjing Street in Chaoyang District also mentioned that food waste collection and clearance, with a collection rate of over 18%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporters searched for information and found that 18% is not high nationwide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Take Shanghai, which has better garbage classification, as an example. According to data from the Shanghai Greening and City Appearance Bureau, the amount of wet garbage separated is basically stable at 35% of the total dry and wet garbage. Around; according to data from the Shanghai Environmental Sanitation Engineering Design Institute in June 2023, kitchen waste accounts for about 30% of the total domestic waste. According to the environmental sanitation industry self-media &quot;Voice of Environmental Sanitation&quot;, the sorting rate of food waste is generally 20%-30%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 3, CCTV reported that the separation rate in certain areas of Haidian District must reach 20%. The person in charge of a domestic waste disposal point said, It is difficult to achieve this indicator in winter because there are less skins and cores of fruits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Lan Yajun’s view is that the company involved did not separate out enough kitchen waste. It must be wrong to use cabbage to make up the numbers, but the food waste separation rate is not only It is the work of third-party companies, and it also depends on whether the early publicity and mobilization efforts are strong, the level of citizen participation is high, and the targets are easy to complete. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Source reduction is more important&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In waste management, classification is only the front-end work, and the separated kitchen waste needs to be disposed of later. The price is high, and equipment investment can easily reach hundreds of millions of yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The 3R principle has been popularized for many years. In the order of reduce, reuse and recycle, reduction ranks first. First. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2021, Li Wei, director of the Urban Management Command Center of Haidian District, Beijing, wrote that the amount of food waste separation in the district is growing rapidly and the separation rate is stable. At more than 18.5%, the volume of other waste dropped by 28.68% year-on-year. The growth rate of domestic waste processing volume entering waste incineration and landfill facilities was controlled within 4%, and the total source volume of domestic waste was controlled within the target of 972,200 tons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Lan Yajun, who has been engaged in garbage classification for more than ten years, also agrees that the purpose of garbage classification is not to carefully divide it into four categories, but to reduce it from the source, without just staring at it. The amount (or separation rate) of food waste is an indicator. He believes that indicators that deserve more attention include the reduction in the total amount of waste entering landfills/power plants (or per capita amount) and the cost of treatment (or per capita cost). &quot;The government is also tightening its belt now. Where does the money for garbage classification come from? How to spend it wisely? Improving quality and efficiency is a very practical issue.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 06 Nov 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[第134届广交会11月4日闭幕，累计境外采购商比上届增长超50%]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260028]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-06 13:00:15&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 4, 2023, in Guangzhou, Guangdong, in the venue of the third phase of the Canton Fair, A buyer passes by a large panda doll.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/06/d53c3c3321.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;721&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/06/d53c3c3321.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257149&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On November 4, 2023, in Guangzhou, Guangdong, at the venue of the third phase of the Canton Fair, buyers passed by a large panda doll. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 4, 2023, the 134th Canton Fair concluded successfully in Guangzhou, and the online platform operated normally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The total exhibition area of ​​this Canton Fair is 1.55 million square meters, with more than 28,000 exhibiting companies and a total of 74,000 booths.

We are very grateful to the media and netizens for their concern for our students and their supervision of school work. The school set up a special work class to review relevant archives and materials, get an in-depth understanding of the situation from relevant teachers and students in the school, and organized a working group to conduct on-site visits and investigations in three students&#39; places of origin. The relevant situation has also been reported to relevant students. The relevant situation is now reported as follows:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After investigation, since the student concerned raised objections to the identification of students with difficulties in the class on September 18, the person in charge of financial aid at both the school and college levels has maintained communication with the student and listened patiently to him. The opinions and appeals indicate that the school understands its actual difficulties and meets the conditions for receiving national scholarships in accordance with regulations. The specific grade is determined after comprehensive evaluation in accordance with relevant procedures. Since the student&#39;s enrollment, the government of the student&#39;s place of origin and relevant relatives have guaranteed tuition and living expenses. He has received second-class national scholarships for his freshman and sophomore years, and all have been paid out. The comprehensive evaluation for the junior year is expected to receive a second-class national scholarship. The college has announced the evaluation results from October 24th to October 27th. There is no &quot;crowding&quot; of the national scholarship quota. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After investigation, the family and personal circumstances of the other two students involved meet the conditions for financial aid for needy students. One student is expected to receive a second-class national scholarship this school year through comprehensive evaluation, and the other student is evaluated comprehensively for this school year. The candidate is expected to receive the National Inspirational Scholarship. No material fraud was found, the assessment complied with relevant regulations, and no &quot;malfeasance and abuse of power&quot; issues were found. The daily necessities alleged in the video were purchased with the above-mentioned students’ income from their work-study studies or were gifts from their relatives. Their high consumption behavior has been verified to be untrue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After repeated investigations by the school, there are no children of martyrs among the students at school, and there is no situation where the children of martyrs are not supported. All orphans among current students who have been identified by the civil affairs department have enjoyed state funding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The investigation also found that the relevant departments of the school were insufficient in their sincerity and care for students when carrying out funding work. The school will carefully summarize, further refine and optimize the student aid work, and provide more warmth and care to students from families with financial difficulties. We would like to thank all sectors of society for their concern, support and assistance to our school and related students, and welcome all sectors of society to continue to supervise and guide the work of our school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 06 Nov 2023 12:55:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
