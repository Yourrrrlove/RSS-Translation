Guide local public security agencies to establish hierarchical and classified early warning and dissuasion mechanisms, and promote the implementation of the &quot;Xiamen Experience&quot; nationwide.

When they went to the hotel and took apart the chandelier, they found that the camera was still there, which shocked them. People are extremely frightened when they think about it carefully. If someone is secretly photographed while staying in a hotel, what responsibility should the hotel bear? Hidden photography has been banned for many times. How can we eradicate the industrial chain behind it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a recent report from Guangxi TV, Mr. Hu from Nanning recently received an intimate video of himself and his fiancée staying in a hotel a year ago. When he arrived at the hotel, he discovered that the two cameras hidden in the chandelier were still there. The hotel manager said that they were also victims. There was no abnormality in other rooms after checking, and they only wanted to refund the room fee. The report attracted a lot of attention online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;News about being secretly photographed while staying in a hotel appears frequently. Searching for &quot;hotel sneak shots&quot; on a certain search engine can yield tens of millions of related information. Recent news, in addition to the above mentioned, also appeared in Lianyungang, Jiangsu, Loudi, Hunan and other places. A few years ago, the person in charge of a hotel in Zhengzhou, Henan Province even claimed that 80% of hotels had secret cameras. In fact, hidden cameras are not only found in hotels, but also in fitting rooms of clothing stores, toilets in office buildings, and even in the toilets of high-speed trains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These hidden cameras seriously violate the privacy of others and are undoubtedly illegal and criminal acts. If a hotel installs a camera without permission, the hotel will certainly be held responsible. But if someone else secretly installed it without the hotel’s knowledge, does the hotel need to take responsibility? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are indeed many such situations. According to industry insiders, bad guys can pretend to be guests staying in hotels, install cameras in just ten minutes at a time, and then change rooms for various reasons, and can secretly install several rooms at a time. In the case of a camera being discovered in a Lianyungang hotel, the suspect captured by the police was an unemployed person, not a hotel employee. In a guiding case released by the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate in 2022, criminals also secretly installed cameras in the rooms of many hotels to take photos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, is it true that, as the manager of the hotel in Nanning claimed, they are also victims and do not need to bear responsibility for the infringement of their guests? Of course not. When travelers check into a hotel, they certainly regard the hotel room as a private place and have reasonable expectations for their privacy in the room. The hotel should fulfill its reasonable obligations to protect the privacy of guests. Guests were secretly photographed and their privacy was invaded, which is inseparable from the hotel&#39;s failure to fulfill its safety and security obligations. As for this hotel in Nanning, the camera is still there more than a year later, which shows how neglected management it is. If a candid camera incident occurs, the hotel will not only have to close down for rectification, but also compensate the guests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The hotel has an obligation to protect the privacy of its guests. In fact, there are now portable detection instruments specifically for pinhole cameras on the market. As long as the hotel equips cleaning or security personnel with a set, most hidden cameras can be detected in a short time. The cost of doing this is not high. The key is that anti-candid photography should become a standard in the hotel industry and something every hotel must do, just like cleaning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why candid photography in hotels is frequently banned is because there is a black industrial chain behind it. Criminals do not secretly shoot videos for excitement, but put these secretly shot videos on the dark web and other illegal websites for sale. Some websites and social accounts use the banner of &quot;hotel secret photography&quot; to attract users to pay to watch private videos. The entire black industry of candid photography may be worth hundreds of billions of dollars every year. In the aforementioned guidance case issued by the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, criminals used illegal websites, instant messaging software, etc. to publish information and sell secretly filmed private videos. In 2021, Liaoning police also eliminated a black industry chain that used hidden cameras to secretly photograph and live broadcast in hotels for profit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to selling on the dark web, some people also use the private videos captured to extort money. At the end of 2022, after a woman in Loudi, Hunan was secretly filmed in a hotel, someone sent the video to her and extorted money. This time Mr. Hu from Nanning, Guangxi received a secretly filmed video. The other person probably did not remind him that he was secretly filmed, and it was also very possible that he was trying to blackmail him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We must intensify our crackdown on secret photography. Now that all communication accounts implement real-name systems, it shouldn&#39;t be too difficult for the police to find criminals. For those who send messages for extortion, the police can find the blackmailer through the account that sent the message, and then follow the clues to find out how the blackmailer obtained the video, as well as the customer&#39;s contact information and other private information, and eliminate the entire chain. At the same time, they can Find out whether the hotel has any issues with leaking guest privacy. After all, even if criminals secretly install cameras, it would be difficult to know the guests&#39; contact information without a hotel insider, and there would be no way to extort money. Only the secret camera was found, and the police also have the means to find the installer. The police quickly caught the suspect using the cameras of Lianyungang Hotel and the women&#39;s restroom of an office building in Tianjin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the face of rampant candid photography, on the one hand, the police must intensify their crackdown on the black industrial chain. Management of secret photography and recording equipment must also be strengthened. Nowadays, various miniature hidden cameras can be purchased everywhere on the Internet, as well as various teaching videos on camera cracking and vulnerability exploitation, which have contributed to the proliferation of candid photography. The hotel industry should also formulate standards and incorporate anti-peeping cameras into the daily management of the industry to protect the privacy and security of guests as much as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“毛孩子”上幼儿园]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258991]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-24 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/V0LTOkR67vJedXXZb5clBZd8L6rjNgVAPLvRo1Tt.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/V0LTOkR67vJedXXZb5clBZd8L6rjNgVA PLvRo1Tt. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254465&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Two &quot;students&quot; participated in the agility game course in kindergarten&lt;span style=&quot;color : #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Liang Chen/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On an autumn afternoon, three pet dogs of different types participated in games under the guidance of their dog trainers.

They were the Shiba Inu, the Poodle and the Samoyed. At the beginning of the course, when they saw the stranger who was taking pictures with the camera, the three students immediately gave different feedback: the little Shiba Inu focused on the handler’s commands; the poodle kept barking while tentatively approaching the stranger, and the course was at a loss. The Samoyed also noticed the presence of the camera and tried to get closer in a friendly manner. When the dog trainer gave the instruction, it immediately returned to the game. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/tO4JE0DuciA7OwPu0kt49VMpwuAlvYIgyGVyx3U4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/tO4JE0DuciA7OwPu0kt49VMpwuAlvYIgyGVyx3U4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254453&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Fat Tiger&quot; participates in the educational game class in kindergarten&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Liang Chen/picture)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/kZ21UuvWMsdCj28jPMXKyxiita4EsHe9PMhCctsW.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/kZ21UuvWMsdCj28jPMXKyxiita4EsHe9PMhCctsW.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254454&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Fat Tiger&quot; experiences the cute beast theater in kindergarten&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Liang Chen/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Dogs also have their own personalities. You can see that the three of them are completely different. This has nothing to do with their body shape. It is determined by genes first and is related to their growth experience. Poodles are very vigilant. In fact, they are very vigilant. It&#39;s not to attack you, it&#39;s just to scare you - &#39;Don&#39;t come here, don&#39;t hurt me, I&#39;m very fierce, listen to how loud I scream&#39;, but in fact this just reflects its timidity and sensitivity.

Starting from the beginning of 2023, Li Chen found that the demand for pet foster care and kindergarten attendance had “exploded.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/FC6KETtmuncBPDSPDhxTSAhX45uo5giBOXqwQhFk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/FC6KETtmuncBPDSPDhxTSAhX45uo5giBOXqwQhFk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254463&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Sister Wang and 9-year-old &quot;Coffee Bean&quot; are in the cute animal party.

I will be very calm when I go out and don’t have to feel guilty. I always feel that the dog has only one thing in his life, which is to wait for me at home.” Li Chen believes that with the progress of society and the changes in the thinking of pet owners, Nowadays, pet owners are no longer concerned about whether their pets are eating imported dog food, but also about the mental health of their pets - whether you are happy today. Dogs also need their own spiritual world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The slogan of the kindergarten is &quot;Let dogs be dogs again&quot;. Through many courses, training is provided to help them regain their instincts as animals, such as sniffing, hunting and swimming, and enhance the dogs&#39; confidence and physical fitness. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/u4ADV0FJUMQxzOuo358BIoMpSQ2kBW2owRMc26Xs.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/u4ADV0FJUMQxzOuo358BIoMpSQ2kBW2owRMc26Xs.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254460&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;San San’s mother took her 4 adopted elderly dogs to the cute animal party for a birthday party&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Liang Chen /Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Li Chen, the current kindergarten parents are mainly those born in the 1980s and 1990s. They are not all middle-class or white-collar workers from well-off families, but they are very willing to give to &quot;hairy children&quot; Spend money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only young people, but some elderly people also spend a lot of money to create a healthy and comfortable life for their &quot;hairy children&quot;. Li Chen calls it &quot;a step-by-step relationship.&quot; She hosted a retired couple who regularly visited their daughter out of town every year. During the two or three months away from Beijing, they adopted two Chuan Chuan children (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Hybrid breed dog&lt;/span>;) and put it here with Li Chen. &quot;In their eyes, pets are the same as family members.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/HIhqM5okdFH3w15o1XUrPF20x55vH5IW5PIUdth0. jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/HIhqM5okdFH3w15o1XUrPF20x55vH5IW5PIUdth0.jpg&quot; data-key= &quot;254457&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Three huskies are waiting in the restaurant&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Liang Chen/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Coffee Bean is a teddy dog ​​who is 9 years old this year. Sister Wang remembers the first time after she went to kindergarten, the clerk dropped it off, turned around and left, with the coffee beans still chasing her. &quot;The dog&#39;s reaction was very real. From then on, I knew that they must be good to Doudou.&quot; This is the fifth year that Coffee Bean has come to the kindergarten. From the beginning, no one could touch him and he would bark when he saw people. Now he often pretends to be Doudou. Cuteness attracts the attention of those around you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sister Wang and her husband are from the DINK tribe. She “raises coffee beans as sons” and never hesitates to spend money on them. Whenever there is an event in the store, Sister Wang always thinks about renewing the fee. Li Chen saw the sufficient balance on her card and always advised her to spend rationally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiao Cheng used to love traveling and buying bags, but now she spends all the money she has saved on 90,000 yuan, which is about 4,000 to 5,000 yuan a month.

Although some pet-themed movies would be reserved, the speakers in the theater were designed for humans and were not suitable for dogs&#39; hearing systems. &quot;I hope to provide owners and pets with a diversified choice, even if it meets some very niche needs, but there is no way to experience it elsewhere.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http ://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/fhNiWp9f8o5hBGPiBdk2Dwh4lEhelsNP5xoThX4Q.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/fhNiWp9f8o5hBGPiBdk2Dwh4lEhelsNP5xoThX4Q.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254456&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;This The huskies are being frightened - screening out and weeding out dogs who tend to be overly fearful, aggressive or overly excited about running, screaming, overly enthusiastic people.

Visual China&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“You can’t say that we beat dogs, we really have never beaten them.” On October 20, 2023, Zhang Yong was a little nervous when talking about the recent public opinion about dog hunting, and emphasized that they were civilized law enforcement. , the entire process was recorded with a law enforcement recorder and recorded in the ledger. &quot;It must be ensured that they are all alive and cannot be damaged.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The director of the Publicity Unit of the Urban Comprehensive Law Enforcement Bureau of Saihan District, Hohhot City is worried about the public opinion that a Rottweiler dog bit a 4-year-old girl in Chongzhou The chain reaction of events. A video of a ferocious dog biting a person swept the entire Internet, and dog hunting operations took place in many places. It was reported on the Internet that a residential property management team had set up a &quot;dog fighting team&quot;, and security guards patrolled with sticks and nets; Bozhou in Anhui, Zhengzhou in Henan, Taixing in Jiangsu, Urban management departments in Qingdao, Shandong and other places have successively released videos of catching stray dogs, and netizens have begun heated discussions about whether stray dogs should be culled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Controversial cases also emerged. A stray dog ​​living in Chongqing University of International Business and Economics was driven to death by security guards. On October 20, the school reported that a student was chased by a stray dog ​​on his way back to bed. The school security guard had engaged in inappropriate behavior during the chase and the security guard involved had been suspended. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found that after this incident, many places carried out special rectifications on the behavior of ownerless dogs, aggressive dogs, and not wearing leashes. But at the same time, various rumors are also circulating on online platforms. In fact, in many places, catching stray dogs is a regular task. The captured stray dogs will be sent to stray animal rescue centers for shelter and will not be killed. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;What responsibilities should the property owner bear?&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After the Rottweiler dog biting incident, slogans were hung in many places in the Xichen Oasis Community of Hengda where the girl lived: &quot;Walking dogs in a civilized manner and keeping the leash on them&quot; &quot;, keep your mouth shut and don&#39;t hurt others&quot; &quot;Tighten the &#39;civilized rope&#39; and be a civilized dog owner&quot;...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 20, a mother who lived above the victim girl told a Southern Weekend reporter , the day the girl was bitten, the angry owners were already discussing in the owner group: &quot;If such a big thing happened, where is the security guard?&quot; &quot;Why don&#39;t they know when an outside dog comes in?&quot; Under pressure, the property began patrolling daily to catch off-leash dogs. These tasks will be posted to the group one by one and reported to the owner, with arrest videos and photos attached. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This tense atmosphere quickly spread to other communities. On October 17, the media reported that a &quot;dog fighting team&quot; was set up in Fuhe Yujing Community in Chengdu City. In the video, security guards were patrolling with sticks and nets. The property staff said: &quot;All stray dogs are left unattended and without leashes.&quot; Yes, the whole community needs to be rectified.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon of October 18, the Sanduhui Chaowai Community in Chengdu hung a banner in the name of the property saying &quot;The community will hunt and kill unleashed cats and dogs.&quot; The word &quot;hunt and kill&quot; immediately caused worries and accusations from pet owners in the community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Li Ming, a resident of the community, the idea of ​​&quot;hunting and killing&quot; actually came from the community&#39;s mother group. Out of concern, the mothers suggested in the group &quot;methods to deal with stray dogs: first, kill or capture them as much as possible, second, drive them out of the community and then call the police to notify the community.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, those who opposed the culling called the government service hotline 12345 to complain one after another on the evening of the 18th. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next morning, the property management company stated that the banner was inappropriate and had been removed. &quot;The property management company no longer dares to answer the phone. The street refused to allow them to kill the people by force and warned them in the morning.&quot; Li Ming said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters called the property and street office of the community many times, but none of them got through. On the 20th, the Property Affairs Service Center of the Chengdu Municipal Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau responded to the media saying that the center had not received a notice that a dog hunting team was set up in a community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chang Sha, a lawyer at Beijing Jingdu Law Firm, has been involved in cases of dog injuries. She believes that the community property has a safety obligation to the owners. Therefore, if there is an ownerless dog in the community, the property owner must be responsible for evicting it. Or management responsibility, otherwise you will have to bear fault liability for stray dogs hurting people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But on the other hand, the property management company does not have the power to enforce the law, so for dogs with owners, the property management cannot take mandatory management measures, such as directly arresting them. In non-emergency situations, property management can only be handled by persuasion or handed over to urban management and public security agencies with law enforcement powers. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Remediation in many places, rumors go hand in hand&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the evening of the 18th, when the owners of a Chengdu community were arguing about whether to cull stray dogs, the urban management department of Jinshui District, Zhengzhou City, Henan Province targeted dogs without leashes. The act was enforced overnight and broadcast live. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The dog-catching controversy began to spread to many places across the country, resulting in law enforcement actions. In this live broadcast in Zhengzhou, a young man holding a French bulldog was chased for a long distance. According to the live video, although the urban management personnel repeatedly emphasized that they would not harm the dog and would only take it back for registration and investigation, the young man tried to escape with the black dog after some unsuccessful negotiations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This video has become another spreading point of this Internet storm. Xiao Zhen, a citizen who also raises French bulldogs in Zhengzhou, told Southern Weekend reporters that it is indeed prohibited to raise French bulldogs in Zhengzhou. Dog licenses are usually not allowed, but the law enforcement is not strict and &quot;we would check occasionally in the past.&quot; At the same time, many cities across the country allow the breeding of French bulldogs, including Beijing, Shanghai, Xi&#39;an, Dalian, Harbin, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Changsha, etc. After learning that the young man needed to pay a fine of 5,000 yuan, the group of French bullfighting enthusiasts sent him red envelopes one after another, saying that they would help him get his dog back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Du Fan, president of the Wuhan Small Animal Protection Association, said that the current management of dogs in cities is mainly based on regulations formulated by each locality. Such administrative regulations are not very effective, so many people do not apply for dog licenses. Nor do they keep dogs according to regulations. (For details, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/content/258846&quot;>;&quot;Many experts talk about the Rottweiler dog biting a girl: &quot;The key is to manage people, followed by managing dogs&quot;&quot;&lt;/ a>;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the division of powers for dog management in cities is not clear. Most cities are currently in charge of public security, and some are under the charge of urban management. Dog management also involves industry and commerce, food safety, and public security. Management and other departments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident of Rottweiler dogs injuring children, many places issued special management actions. Bozhou in Anhui, Taixing in Jiangsu, Shenqiu in Henan, Shehong in Sichuan and other places targeted ownerless dogs, aggressive dogs, and unprotected dogs. The behavior of pulling ropes will be specially rectified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In it, rumors and facts are mixed. Southern Weekend reporters found that in videos calling for not killing stray dogs, photos of dozens of dog corpses and scenes of being thrown to death often appear, but there is no time stamp. Just looking at the background of the picture, buses and buildings should be numbers. years ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the hot topic on Weibo &quot;Puppies don&#39;t feel like they are wandering&quot;, many netizens identified a photo of a puppy that was still grinning after being arrested as the one involved in the Chongqing University of International Business and Economics. It was a yellow dog, with the caption &quot;It was still laughing when it was caught, it thought it was going to have a home&quot;, and expressed condolences. However, the author of the original picture refuted the rumors and said that the smiling puppy was taken in April and is not the same dog as the one in Chongqing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It’s a bit out of focus.” Zhou Wei, director of the Jiangsu Provincial Zoological Society, found that as the situation developed, netizens’ discussions gradually turned into opposing issues such as loving dogs or not, and culling or not culling. , without going into details. For example, many video titles say &quot;catching&quot; stray dogs, but most of the current videos only show &quot;catching&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Normalization of Urban Management&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found through searches that many dog-catching videos were released by the official accounts of urban management and public security agencies in various places, such as Qingdao West Coast New District Comprehensive Administrative Law Enforcement Bureau. It released three videos in a row, introducing that catching stray dogs is a regular task. The captured stray dogs will be sent to the stray animal rescue center for shelter and will not be killed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The distribution of dog leashes and dog muzzles has attracted attention. The Comprehensive Administrative Law Enforcement Bureau of Shehong City, Sichuan Province, which is considered by netizens to be a model of civilized law enforcement, told Southern Weekend reporters that they will set up dog leashes starting in 2021. The management office is equipped with professional dog-catching equipment and vehicles, and has 5 staff members daily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Saihan District, Hohhot City, according to the City Comprehensive Law Enforcement Bureau, the bureau took over the work of catching stray dogs in 2020. In 2023 alone, it received more than 1,100 related reports and has captured stray dogs. There are more than 300 dogs, and most of the reports are about barking dogs disturbing people, especially in the early morning and early morning. Zhang Yong, head of the bureau&#39;s publicity department, said that when team members receive a reporting call, they must contact the person involved in a timely manner and respond to the person after handling the case. If they cannot catch the person, the team members will have to go there at least three times within a week. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This doesn&#39;t sound like an easy job. Zhang Yong said that they have specially formulated a long-term mechanism for this purpose, which is divided into day shift and night shift. &quot;There are 38 people in the mobile squadron participating in dog hunting.&quot; They have to patrol the 1,025 square kilometers under the jurisdiction of Saihan District. When the dog climbs over the fence and enters the bush, it is difficult for law enforcement officers to catch up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More importantly, stray dogs have a keen sense of smell. As soon as the law enforcement vehicles that carry stray dogs all the year round stop in a place, &quot;no dogs will come out of this area.&quot; Zhang Yong said that one of their team members saw a stray dog ​​while driving around in his car and called for a law enforcement vehicle. Before the vehicle arrived, the stray dog ​​started to get restless. &quot;It could smell the smell of the car.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every dog-catching team member in Saihan District has been bitten by a dog, and some have broken their legs while catching dogs. The tool they use is a fishing net. Dogs of different sizes use different types of fishing nets. The largest ones use fiber rope nets as thick as their thumbs. &quot;They have very good teeth and can bite through thin ropes in one bite.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sichuan Province Shehong City Comprehensive Administrative Law Enforcement Bureau and Qingdao West Coast New District Comprehensive Law Enforcement Administration both responded to Southern Weekend reporters that the tools used to catch dogs are mainly fishing nets. In most of the dog-catching videos circulated on the Internet, law enforcement officers used fishing nets. Only one video showed a dog-catching video with a license plate number from Taizhou, Zhejiang, using curved clamps. Zhou Wei believes that the fishing net is currently a more suitable tool for catching dogs. It has a soft texture and can trap dogs without causing too much harm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Yong said that after the stray dogs are caught, they will be sent to the detention center managed by the public security department for adoption. After the dog is inspected, the detention center will give the urban management team member a receipt, which will clearly indicate the receipt. Quantity and condition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A reporter from Southern Weekend called the Hohhot Public Security Bureau Dog Inspection Station, and the other party replied that the institute has 50 acres of kennels and is currently able to raise stray cats and dogs until they die of natural causes. In addition, the center is open to the public for adoption, and you can visit, adopt or donate materials during the open day. As for the number of stray cats and dogs currently detained in the inspection center, the staff member said that detailed data could not be provided for the time being. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Bodhi Nursing Home for Stray Fur Children in Shehong, Sichuan is a privately run base for stray cats and dogs. It occupies a hilltop in the mountains and feeds stray cats and dogs in different areas. In 2021, the base began to receive stray cats and dogs caught by the urban management department, 20-30 every year. &quot;They are sent here sporadically, and they are all caught after being complained about disturbing the residents.&quot; Ms. Ren, the person in charge of the base, said that the urban management department Part of the cost of dog food is provided. Cats and dogs will be checked for infectious diseases in advance before delivery. If there are injuries or illnesses, they will go to the pet hospital for treatment first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ms. Ren said that Shehong has launched a special operation to capture stray cats and dogs since October 20, and 11 stray dogs were delivered in just one day. She was a little worried that too many cats and dogs would be sent in a short period of time and that the base would not be able to handle the load. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;More sophisticated, professional and scientific&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On October 20, the French Dou who was captured in Zhengzhou has been brought back to his hometown for adoption , and the Zhengzhou Urban Management Bureau told the media that the case is still going through the process and the fine has not yet been determined. The topic of why French bulldogs are banned has been hotly discussed in the dog breeding circle. Mao Jing, who has raised French bulldogs for many years, saw from this the management problems of dog breeding in the city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mao Jing said that French bulldogs are not clearly marked on Shanghai’s prohibited list, but French bulldogs have long been regarded as a type of bulldog and face different management methods in various districts of Shanghai. In 2014, she raised her first French bulldog, and she successfully applied for a dog license in Siping Street, Yangpu District. In 2016, Mao Jing was planning to raise a second French bulldog, but when she applied for a dog license in Jiangpu Street, the same district, her dog license was rejected. It was approved after a phone appeal. &quot;The handler didn&#39;t know much about this dog breed.&quot; In 2019, Shanghai stated that legal fighting is allowed in the city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the French Bulldog incident in Zhengzhou, she specially compared the lists of banned dogs in Zhengzhou and Shanghai, and found that Shanghai clearly prohibited the breeding of British bulldogs, but French Bulldogs were not allowed; while Zhengzhou clearly prohibited the breeding of French Bulldogs, But I can&#39;t help but raise heroes to fight. Mao Jing said that the two types of dogs have different body shapes and agility. In comparison, Yingdou can grow to 60-80 pounds. &quot;Even if it doesn&#39;t bite, hitting someone may be more serious.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There is actually no common standard for dog breeds in our country.” Zhou Wei said that when foreign dog breeds were introduced in the early stages, there may be a lack of understanding of the dog breed’s habits or translation problems. &quot;This reflects management lag.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China&#39;s pet industry has developed by leaps and bounds in more than ten years, and the problem of how people and animals coexist in cities has continued to become prominent. The &quot;2021 China Pet Industry White Paper&quot; shows that the total number of pet dogs and pet cats in cities and towns nationwide in 2021 will exceed 112 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhou Wei believes that in terms of dog management, a more refined, professional and scientific management mechanism is needed starting from the source. For example, when breeding, attention should be paid to the breed genes and how to train them. The problem is that there is currently a lack of supervision in the upstream breeding stage, and it is only at the pet raising stage that it starts to get tight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Du Fan also holds a similar view. He believes that many incidents of dog injuries can be traced back to the source: &quot;Why are banned violent dogs still sold on the market?&quot; From this, he suggested that dogs are born from Establish a series of supervision mechanisms for sales and breeding, and clarify departmental responsibilities and management rights and responsibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhou Wei suggested that solving the current problem can start with popular science education, such as providing professional training services to campuses and real estate properties: how to deal with ferocious dogs in the community, how to correctly place and capture them; People provide training: how to scientifically understand and control their pet dogs, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Wuhan Small Animal Association, where Du Fan works, has reached a cooperation with the local public security department. Around the 25th of each month, some captured stray dogs from the inspection center are open to the public for adoption, calling for &quot;adopting instead of purchasing&quot; &quot;. Du Fan said that the previous two adoption events were successfully held, and all the dogs kept for inspection were successfully adopted. &quot;We are currently preparing for the third one.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ Southern Weekend reporter Gao Yichen also contributed to this article (Li Ming and Mao Jing are pseudonyms in the article)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中美经济工作组举行第一次会议]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259175]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-24 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;According to He Lifeng, Vice Premier of the State Council and Chinese leader of China-US Economic and Trade, and Janet.

It is worth noting that on September 29, the Ministry of Education responded to a netizen’s question about “Whether the first degree after graduation is a junior college or a bachelor’s degree?” The concept of “first degree” is not used in the relevant policies and documents of the national education administration department regarding the learning experience of scientific and cultural education and skills training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, from an objective point of view, graduates with master&#39;s and doctoral degrees from prestigious schools generally have some advantages in the job market. Needless to say, this may be &quot;first degree discrimination&quot; The realistic background in which relevant issues have received attention. But is similar recruitment behavior “merit-based” or “discriminatory”? It may not be possible to generalize, but the issues of corporate operational autonomy and employment autonomy that run through it are also important aspects worthy of analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, for graduate students from 985 universities, does the recruiting unit or human resources specialist make a clear employment choice based on the prerequisite of &quot;undergraduate degree from a prestigious school&quot;? This is actually hard to say. Especially as a for-profit organization, the company will ultimately look at whether the applicant&#39;s abilities and talents match the company&#39;s employment needs. It may also be that the company&#39;s interviewer confirms the match between the applicant&#39;s abilities and the company&#39;s needs through a comprehensive, complete and systematic assessment. . And graduates with master&#39;s and doctoral degrees who have been blessed by famous schools may have shown certain advantages in this link and finally got the opportunity, but it may not necessarily be simple and crude academic qualifications that win. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Generally speaking, the recruitment process of the employer is that the human resources specialist will screen the resume before the interview. Only after passing the preliminary screening will he be qualified to participate in the initial interview hosted by the human resources department and even the professional interview hosted by the leader of the hiring department. interview. If some companies clearly stipulate in black and white that they will not recruit students with &quot;double bachelor&#39;s degrees&quot; or are suspected of academic discrimination, if master&#39;s and doctoral graduates with &quot;double bachelor&#39;s degrees&quot; can pass the resume screening, in this sense, 985 As a stepping stone, colleges and universities have already been used in the preliminary screening stage. The stepping stone is just a stepping stone. Next, it depends on whether the job seeker has real ability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, it should be noted that there is no need for society to over-amplify the halo blessing of the so-called &quot;first degree&quot;. Today, there are so many students graduating from 985 with undergraduate degrees. In the face of the severe employment situation, some Ph.D.s from Peking University have gone to compete for urban management personnel, and some have Ph.D.s from Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine to work as school doctors in middle schools. Undergraduate program 985 really does not have as dazzling aura and powerful blessing as some people imagine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, objectively speaking, students from undergraduate 985 colleges generally have some advantages in the job market compared to non-985 colleges. This itself also has a reasonable side. If this advantage does not exist, then the motivation for students to work hard to get into a good university may not exist, and there will be no difference between a good university and an average university. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, on the surface, students have gained some advantages with the blessing of diplomas from 985 colleges, but the actual logic is the other way around: the ranking of college entrance examination scores and the distinction between prestigious schools and non-prestigious schools are Ranking of students’ intelligence and abilities. In this sense, it is generally the outstanding students who make the 985 colleges and universities successful, not the other way around. Therefore, the 985 diploma has an important signaling function and constitutes an important reference for employers to screen resumes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, there are people with high scores and low abilities, and there are also people with low scores and high abilities; there are people who make mistakes in the college entrance examination, and there are also people who perform exceptionally well in the college entrance examination. However, firstly, it depends on whether it is a high probability or a small probability; secondly, In the end, everyone has to accept the test of the market and the employer. It depends on the real talent and hard work, whether it is a mule or a horse drawn out for a walk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Enterprises are profit-making organizations, and they will ultimately look at whether the candidates’ abilities and talents match the company’s employment needs, and whether they can create higher value for the company. The HR and employing departments may take a high look at job seekers with 985 undergraduate degrees, but that’s all. Next, it depends on whether the job seekers’ performance in the interview meets their expectations for talents. Especially in free competition industries, companies have no incentive to leave more capable non-985 undergraduate job seekers and instead use incompetent 985 undergraduate job seekers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If there are two people, one has a non-985 degree + 985 graduate school, and the other has a 985 degree + 985 graduate school, and the company does not admit the former but admits the latter, does it become &quot;first degree discrimination&quot;? I&#39;m afraid not so. Job seekers and employers are two-way choices. Reaching a consensus respects the rights of both parties and improves market efficiency. By extension, if job seekers themselves are very capable, but they want to go to a high-paying unit but not to a low-wage unit, does this constitute discrimination against the latter? Even if it is, it is efficiency discrimination and should be justified. Just as when people get married, they would rather find someone with good family conditions than someone with poor conditions. This cannot be said to be discrimination against the latter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, under the severe employment situation, the key to giving students more and better job opportunities is to inspire entrepreneurs’ confidence and expectations for the future, so that they dare to invest real money Pay attention to expand investment and create more and better jobs. This requires respecting entrepreneurs&#39; autonomy in business operations and employment, and not denying the right of enterprises to &quot;select the best&quot; at every turn and weakening entrepreneurs&#39; motivation and confidence in investing and making bets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If companies are not allowed to show their recruitment preferences, there are only two consequences: First, companies hide their preferences in the short term but write them down in their hearts. This is nothing more than making job seekers do more useless work, which is detrimental to job hunting. Is it really good? Second, in the long run, companies will feel that the business environment and conceptual environment are not good, and they will be more cautious in investing and making bets. The process of job creation will be affected. What benefits will it bring to job seekers? In short, society should create a relaxed and rational conceptual environment for entrepreneurs, allowing them to use their intelligence and real money to promote our economy, which will ultimately benefit every job seeker. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 10:01:23 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[触碰寻亲直播间里的伤痛 | 记者手记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259121]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-24 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/10/23/e505f7e258.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/ 23/e505f7e258.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254952&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 14, 2023, Guiyang, Guizhou, four people searched for relatives The parents drove from Kunming, Yunnan, and traveled thousands of kilometers to find their son. (Southern Weekend reporter Liu Yixian/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Interview with Yang Niuhua’s abduction case (for details, see &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com /content/253854&quot;>;Human trafficker Yu Huaying was sentenced to death: she abducted 11 children and even sold her own son&lt;/a>;&quot;), this was the first time I got close to parents looking for relatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the morning of July 14, 2023, Yu Huaying, a human trafficker who abducted Yang Niuhua, was tried at the Intermediate People&#39;s Court of Guiyang City, Guizhou Province. Outside the court, people looking for relatives stood outside. Parents. Most of them wore white shirts with photos of their babies printed on them, and held missing persons signs with yellow characters on a red background. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Looking for his son Li Xianfang&quot;, &quot;Looking for his sons An Xu and An Biao&quot;, &quot;Marshmallow dad looking for his daughter Chen Yangmei&quot;... Each missing person sign is marked with The child’s date of birth, time of loss, physical characteristics at the time of loss, etc. Behind the sign, there were mostly sad faces, as if their facial features were drooped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;While waiting, some parents looking for relatives were also doing live broadcasts, introducing netizens to the progress of the trial and what was going on outside the court, interspersed with &lt;span>;&lt; /span>;Tell how your child was lost, where you went to find your child, and how you got here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I greeted several of the parents, informed the reporter of my identity, and recorded an interview video nearby. After that, as soon as I raised my cell phone to record the video, the parents next to me immediately came up to me, walked around holding the missing persons sign, and occasionally chatted. They know how to &quot;grab traffic&quot; and show their face at any possible opportunity to increase their exposure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This eagerness became more obvious after Yang Niuhua appeared. Parents looking for relatives swarmed up almost in a swarm, surrounding them from front to back, holding signs next to each other. Several times, Yang Niuhua was submerged in the family-seeking signs, and reporters could not find her at all. In the chaos, some parents thrust their missing persons tags into Yang Niuhua&#39;s hands, while others hung a backpack with missing family information on her body. Yang Niuhua understood the mood of these parents looking for relatives and did not refuse. These parents travel around all year round and appear in various hot scenes, striving to let their children see themselves and see that &quot;Mom and Dad are always looking for you.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the afternoon of the day when the trial ended, I knocked on the door of Yang Niuhua’s room, but I was surprised to find that the room was crowded with parents looking for relatives, on the beds and chairs. , the floor, and every corner were filled with people. They are all waiting in line to go to Yang Niuhua&#39;s live broadcast room to introduce their search for relatives. After Yang Niuhua successfully searched for relatives online in 2021, she attracted a lot of attention and accumulated more than 300,000 fans on the short video platform. On important days like court hearings, she is also willing to use her traffic to allow parents to go to the live broadcast room to spread information about finding relatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I sat down next to an aunt in her 50s and watched the live broadcast of people coming and going in the room. It was still mid-summer in July, and this aunt was wearing a long-sleeved pullover with her child’s information printed on it, and several pieces of clothing underneath. After some conversation, she said that she was from the Buyi ethnic group in Guizhou and was born with a disability in her left foot, making it difficult for her to walk long distances. But her husband was ill and bedridden, so she had no choice but to go out alone to find the child. As she spoke, she took off her left boot, revealing that the foot was deformed and looked unbearable. It’s hard to imagine how she followed the family search team to various places in Fujian and Guizhou these days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There is another &quot;marshmallow dad&quot; who impressed me deeply. His daughter was born in 2003 and disappeared in Kunming, Yunnan when she was 3 years old. When Yang Niuhua was being interviewed after the trial, he stood behind Yang Niuhua and suddenly cried uncontrollably. The sound got louder and louder, and finally he squatted on the ground and cried bitterly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For many years, &quot;Marshmallow Daddy&quot; has been doing business in a minivan, selling marshmallows while looking for children, while his wife sells balloons at home to support her life. On the homepage of &quot;Marshmallow Daddy&quot;&#39;s video account, he has been to multiple recognition sites where his family search was successful. The village supermarket in Rongjiang, Guizhou was a hot spot those days. He rushed to the village supermarket to look for his children. In order to save money, the four parents who were looking for relatives cooked their own meals along the way, setting up stoves and shelves in the open air to cook. The four of them spent more than 20 yuan a day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Finding relatives is difficult, and parents searching for relatives hate human traffickers. But they have different views on adoptive families. Some people support the same crime of buying and selling and believe that the person responsible for supporting the family should be held accountable. But more parents will emphasize that they just want to see their children, and they do not ask the children to return to their biological families, nor do they hold them responsible for supporting the family. A very important reason is that many abducted children are afraid of hurting the feelings of their adoptive parents and are unwilling to take the initiative to find relatives, which will increase the difficulty of finding relatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Yu Huaying&#39;s child abduction case, there are still several abducted children who are unwilling to formally recognize their relatives. They are trapped in complex family relationships and do not know what to do. There are also abducted children who have recognized their parents and are not close to their parents. The parent-child relationship is empty and it is not clear where to build it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the family search live broadcast room, parents called on their children who had doubts about their parentage to go to the public security bureau to collect blood and enter it into the family search database, so that one day they can successfully identify their relatives. , &quot;If you want to come back, come back. If you don&#39;t want to come back, you can stay and support your family.&quot;&lt;span>; &lt;/span>;This sentence may be full of pain and pain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I wish them an early reunion with their loved ones. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[睡眠保单规模有多大？如何常态化唤醒？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259165]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-24 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Sleep policies are being required to be cleared within a time limit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The State Administration of Financial Supervision and Administration recently issued a special notice to clean up “sleep policies” in personal insurance within a time limit. According to the notice, for &quot;sleep insurance policies&quot; generated between January 1, 2013 and June 30, 2023, special cleanup work will last for one year starting from October 2023. According to research conducted by researchers at the New Financial Research Center of Southern Weekend, various life insurance companies have begun to look for “owners” of “sleep policies”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why are there sleep insurance policies in China? How will the rights and interests of policyholders be guaranteed? What is the overseas experience in dealing with sleep policies? After studying overseas experience, researchers from Southern Weekend&#39;s New Financial Research Center believe that the cleanup of sleep policies cannot only rely on irregular supervision by regulatory agencies, but should establish an easy-to-check national system, and insurance companies should proactively disclose the status of sleep policies. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;What is&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; a “sleep policy”? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;What is a &quot;sleep policy&quot;? Wang Xiangnan, deputy director of the Insurance and Social Security Research Office of the Institute of Finance, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told a researcher at the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center that &quot;sleep insurance policy&quot; is not clearly defined. It generally refers to an insurance accident or an insurance contract that has expired but has not yet received compensation or Insurance benefits are paid upon maturity, and policies in which the validity of the insurance contract is suspended or terminated but the cash value has not yet been collected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center found that a similar concept abroad is &quot;unclaimed life insurance&quot;. Allstate Insurance Company (Allstate) specifically refers to the situation where the insured dies and the beneficiary fails to apply for insurance compensation. According to the U.S. government website, the United States combines unclaimed insurance income and unpaid wages, pensions, tax refunds, fund income, bond income, etc. into unclaimed funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In layman&#39;s terms, the &quot;sleeping policies&quot; that the State Financial Supervision and Administration Bureau requires to be cleaned up within a time limit this time are the policy owners who &quot;lost contact&quot; resulting in the policy being &quot;not claimed but not claimed&quot; and eventually being &quot;shelved&quot; by the insurance company. &quot;Insurance policy. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Sleep Policy&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Why did it come about&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Why did sleep insurance policies come into being? A partner at Beijing Datong Insurance Sales Company told researchers at the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center that there are many reasons why policy owners “lost contact”. For example, in some families, the elders bought an annuity without notifying their families, and before they could receive it, the elders passed away. This will result in no one applying for a claim; some consumers have purchased insurance, but due to changing contact information, interruption of payment, etc., the policy has expired, and they have forgotten about it and did not return the cash; many families do not keep and manage the insurance policies properly. , family members are unaware of each other’s policy holdings. It is generally difficult for insurance companies to process such policies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center also learned that orphan policies are also one of the reasons for the creation of sleep policies. &lt;span>;Orphan&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;Insurance&lt;/span>; only refers to &lt;span>;policies&lt;/span>; where no one has taken the initiative to provide follow-up services due to the resignation of the original marketing staff. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar to the reasons for domestic sleep insurance policies, foreign sleep insurance policies are also mostly caused by the &quot;loss of contact&quot; of policyholders for various reasons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For policyholders, &quot;sleep policy&quot; means a &quot;sleep fund&quot; or an &quot;insurance window period.&quot; The former corresponds to the situation where the insured has matured survival benefits and maturity benefits that have not been collected; while the latter occurs when the policy is suspended due to &quot;loss of contact&quot; and arrears. This means that the insurance company has the right to terminate the insurance contract. Based on this, this special cleanup operation organized by the State Administration of Financial Supervision and Administration can not only revitalize the &quot;idle funds&quot; sleeping in society, but also safeguard the rights and interests of consumers. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;How big are sleep policies&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The regulatory agency specifically issued a notice to clean up &quot;sleep insurance policies&quot; within a time limit. This means that the &quot;sleep policy&quot; cannot be ignored. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How big is the &quot;sleep policy&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from Southern Weekend’s New Financial Research Center found that, so far, regulatory authorities have not released nationwide statistics. One data that can be referenced is that in August 2014, the former China Insurance Regulatory Commission issued a notice that “all personal insurance issued after June 10, 1999 and effective as of 24:00 on June 30, 2014, with a payment period of more than one year shall be invalid.” &quot;Policies&quot; carried out a special cleanup, and a total of 18.5793 million lapsed personal insurance policies were found, with a cash value of 35.083 billion yuan. The &quot;lapsed personal insurance policies&quot; targeted by this special cleanup operation specifically refer to policies whose contract validity is suspended due to interruption of insurance payments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Sleep policy&quot; includes more than just &quot;life insurance lapse policy&quot;. It can be seen from this that the amount involved in sleep insurance policies should also be larger. Data from various places can serve as examples. Data disclosed by the Anhui Insurance Association shows that as of June 30, 2023, the number of unpaid survival insurance policies that Anhui personal insurance companies should receive is 77,900, involving an amount of 920 million yuan; according to China Banking and Insurance News, in 2022 In 2020, 40 personal insurance companies in Zhejiang carried out the &quot;Looking for Insurance Survival Benefit Recipients&quot; activity. As of December 31, 2020, Zhejiang (excluding Ningbo) had a total of 121,300 expired personal insurance policies with an amount of 779 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data from different insurance companies also show that sleep insurance is no small matter. Ping An Pension Insurance Zhejiang Branch recovered 140 million yuan in &quot;maturity survival funds&quot; for customers from April to August 2022. Xinhua Life official said that from 2021 to the present, Xinhua Insurance Zhejiang Branch has carried out activities to find survival allowance recipients. By visiting village committees and communities, seeking to find &quot;lost&quot; customers from bill-issuing banks, police stations, household registration centers, etc., a total of We recovered 2,193 &quot;lost&quot; customers, assisted them in the collection procedures, and paid 90.46 million yuan in survival benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Financial reports are not disclosed separately&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;How motivated are insurance companies to clean up sleep policies? Is the &quot;sleep money&quot; lying on the account a windfall for insurance companies? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center checked the financial reports of listed insurance companies and found that each company did not disclose this separately. This means that companies treat this as a normal insurance policy in their financial reports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A senior official from a listed insurance company confirmed in a survey by a researcher from the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center that from the insurance business side, insurance companies do not distinguish between &quot;sleep policies&quot; and &quot;sleep policies&quot; in their financial statements. Normal policy. &quot;Sleep insurance policies&quot; follow the same accounting standards as other insurance policies. For example, premium income is included in asset accounts, and insurance liability reserves are included in the &quot;withdrawal of insurance liability reserves&quot; account based on actuarially determined amounts. The reserve withdrawal ratio has many rules according to the type of insurance and reserve type, and the conditions of each insurance company are different. Coupled with factors such as long coverage periods and diverse policy statuses, “sleep policy” cleanup is a complex undertaking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A partner at another insurance sales company even said that insurance companies may not have the incentive to clean up sleep policies. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;How to wake up the &quot;sleep policy&quot;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;How to apply for a wake-up sleep policy overseas? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Securities Times reported in May 2020 that no one claims millions of dollars in life insurance rights every year in the United States. In 2023, the website of the Association of British Insurers quoted sources as conservatively estimating that forgotten and unclaimed insurance policies across the UK are expected to involve a total of 200 million pounds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center found that in the United States, consumers can either log in to the National Association of Insurance Regulators (NAIC) system to inquire, or they can find third-party agencies to help with inquiries. According to the American Family Life Insurance Company (Aflac) website, different states in the United States have different legal requirements for unclaimed insurance policies. In many cases, beneficiary retroactive policies have no time limit, and once a beneficiary submits the policy, the insurance company takes a few weeks to a month to process and pay out. In addition to receiving insurance benefits, beneficiaries can also receive part of the interest income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, in order to cooperate with the cleanup of &quot;sleep insurance policies&quot;, the State Financial Supervision and Administration Bureau also guided relevant agencies to research and establish a unified &quot;sleep insurance policy&quot; information inquiry platform for consumers to inquire independently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center believe that the cleanup of sleep insurance policies cannot only rely on irregular supervision by regulatory agencies. In addition to establishing a national unified policy query system as soon as possible, regulatory authorities and industry associations should require insurance companies Put reminders for policyholders at the forefront. At the same time, insurance companies should use financial technology to enable the tracking of sleep policies, and even use big data systems to check all policies once a year to achieve normalized wake-ups. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[新任中国足协主席宋凯：不能再出台“奇葩”政策]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259155]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-23 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On the 22nd, the new Chinese Football Association Chairman Song Kai came to Weifang, Shandong to watch the second China Youth Football League Men’s U15 finals , and held discussions with youth training and media representatives. This was his first public appearance as chairman of the Football Association. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the work ideas of the new Chinese Football Association, Song Kai said that Chinese football must make up its mind to follow the &quot;Long March Road&quot; in the future, regard youth training as a top priority, and also improve China&#39;s football through greater opening up. football competitiveness and ensuring that the policies of the Chinese Football Association are reasonable and stable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/4c31a52c7e5b9847bbfb84f41cf49701.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height= &quot;750&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/4c31a52c7e5b9847bbfb84f41cf49701.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255015&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chinese Football Association Chairman Song Kai (middle) and Chinese Football Association Vice Chairman Yuan Yongqing (right) and Xu Jiren at a media symposium&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Make youth training a top priority Come and catch us.”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The first stop after taking office was to inspect youth competitions. The message Song Kai wanted to convey was very clear: “If we want to revitalize football, we must first focus on youth training. In the future, the Chinese Football Association will make youth training a top priority. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song Kai said that on the one hand, high-level coaches should be encouraged to engage in youth training. &quot;Poor competitive performance first shows that training is not good. We do not have good coaches for youth training, and the salary of youth training coaches is indeed very different from that of professional teams. This is a real problem that needs to be gradually changed. The Chinese Football Association must strive to adopt policy regulations and Orientation, guiding the best coaches to focus on youth training.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, a high-level and stable youth competition system must be established. &quot;When they are 12 years old, Chinese players are at the same level as Japanese and Korean players, but by the age of 16, the gap is huge. This is mainly due to the gap in the competition system. Only by participating in more high-level competitions can players continue to grow. The problem with our competition system is that it is unstable , the youth competition system must remain stable and reasonable improvements can be made, but the overall framework must remain unchanged.&quot; Song Kai said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/c238d83b720e76683a63f3053a1db926.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height= &quot;667&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/c238d83b720e76683a63f3053a1db926.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255014&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;(File picture) Young players playing on the court. Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhou Mi&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Talking about what kind of youth training model Chinese football should adopt, Song Kai said: &quot;Currently, Chinese football youth training mainly includes professional clubs, professional sports teams, social institutions and campus football. Waiting for different routes, the Chinese Football Association must first consolidate its base areas and defend its basic market. It is unrealistic for Chinese football to completely return to the sports team model, but the policy guidance of the National Games can be used to increase the enthusiasm of provinces and cities and increase their commitment to football. support,&quot; Song Kai said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the basis of insisting on practicing internal skills, Song Kai believes that the development of youth training also requires the help of external forces. &quot;With the help of external forces, including inviting in, going out and naturalizing players, this can all be discussed. There is a gap between our understanding of youth training and that of developed countries in football, so we must learn with an open mind. The internationalization of youth training is very important. According to statistics, China is now There are 137 registered foreign teachers. In the future, we will continue to improve the internationalization of youth training coaches. Youth leagues can also consider relaxing nationality restrictions and increasing exchange opportunities.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images. infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/1f2957ee55bb560399fe419d8ecd75e9.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;725&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/ medias/image/23/10/23/1f2957ee55bb560399fe419d8ecd75e9.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255016&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;September 8, East AFC U15 Men&#39;s Football Championship, the Chinese team celebrated their victory at the award ceremony.

Song Kai said: &quot;The U15 players do give us some hope. By the 2034 World Cup, they will be in their prime. We must do a good job in this age group. All parties have suggested applying for the World Youth Championship and the World Youth Championship. The Chinese Football Association is currently considering it, and we are also discussing this matter with FIFA.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Chinese football will not work if it does not open up&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In his inaugural speech on the 16th, Song Kaiti To topics such as &quot;more openness&quot; and &quot;connecting with the AFC and relaxing restrictions on foreign aid&quot;. At this media symposium, Song Kai explained that he hopes to force Chinese football to improve its competitiveness through wider opening up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song Kai believes that Chinese football has been in a relatively closed environment for a long time, and players lack competition. &quot;Many industries have proven that only with full competition in an open market can low-cost and high-quality products be produced. Now the AFC is relaxing restrictions on foreign aid. The Saudi League plans to increase the number of foreign aid quotas for each team to 10. Others Everything is opening up, and Chinese football cannot do without opening up.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The long march of Chinese football requires players to walk together. How to let the players go on the long march? Education alone is not enough, but competition and a high elimination rate are also required . By expanding opening up, we will force Chinese players to improve their level in competition.&quot; Song Kai said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/2f5472dd47520d8bf451e2f807ca9892.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height= &quot;750&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/2f5472dd47520d8bf451e2f807ca9892.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255017&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For wider opening up This may lead to domestic players not being able to play football, and thus affecting the national team. Song Kai said frankly: &quot;Many national leagues, including Spain, relaxed their foreign aid policies, which caused great controversy in the country at the time. In the process of expanding the opening up of Chinese football, , there will definitely be pain, and the Chinese Football Association must remain determined. If domestic players cannot play in the Chinese Super League, they can go to lower-level leagues. The policy can only be more open and cannot go back.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song Kai At the same time, he said that the Chinese Football Association must move at a steady pace in expanding its opening up. &quot;We must not rush to introduce policies. We must use one year for all parties to fully discuss, think things over clearly, and then implement them step by step.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;The Chinese Football Association cannot introduce any more &#39;weird&#39; policies. Policy&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Song Kai said frankly that many policies of the Chinese Football Association were previously formulated haphazardly, which caused harm to the development of Chinese football. &quot;The Chinese Football Association can no longer introduce &#39;weird&#39; policies like the &#39;National Team League&#39; and &#39;U23 Player Policy&#39; in the future. If the Chinese Football Association wants to issue new policies, they must meet social expectations.

In fact, Zhang There is no such relationship with the woman (Xu), but the person who has a male-female relationship with Xu is precisely the person who shot and posted the video, Meng. The married man Meng had a relationship with the unmarried woman Xu during the relationship. Because of an emotional dispute, he created a related video through grafting and malicious editing and published it on a certain platform, in order to &quot;retaliate&quot; against the other party. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meng released a video containing false information and insulted and slandered others, which is obviously an illegal act that blatantly infringes on the reputation rights of others. If this is regarded as a report, then it is undoubtedly a malicious and false accusation. . The matter is far from that simple. The investigation showed that although Zhang and Xu, who both worked in the high-tech development zone, did not have an improper relationship between men and women as mentioned in the &quot;report video&quot;, they had the problem of accepting corporate banquets in violation of regulations. It is this situation that has caused differences of opinion among netizens who have been paying attention to the incident. Some netizens believe that although Zhang and Xu have other problems, &quot;one code to one code&quot; cannot change the illegal fact that Meng has violated the reputation rights of others. Other netizens believe that although the &quot;report&quot; of the video publisher Meng was untrue, it uncovered other problems. If Meng is held accountable, potential whistleblowers like this will be discouraged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This debate actually contains a rather profound social moral issue, that is, the encouragement of &quot;pan-moral criticism&quot; and &quot;low-cost reporting&quot; will really help to form a clean and upright society. Environment? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Pan-moral criticism&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Pan-moral criticism&quot; is a very popular criticism method in the Internet era. Critics often moralize all personal grievances and social phenomena and use &quot;public opinion&quot; to moralize them. &quot;In the name of &quot;justice&quot;, they gain the moral high ground and condescendingly carry out absolute moral criticism of the target of attack. Critics often use &quot;group labels&quot; to project a certain stereotype of the public on the specific parties involved in the incident, deliberately disrupting the public&#39;s judgment of the basic facts of the incident, and then leading the public to attack the parties in order to achieve the moral integrity of the parties. &quot;social death&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Precisely because &quot;pan-moral criticism&quot; can often occupy the moral high ground in the name of public opinion, after successfully arousing public sentiment, the critic himself obtains a certain kind of &quot;moral golden body&quot;, even if he himself Even if there are major moral flaws, they can often be exempted from questioning and accountability under the banner of &quot;justice.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the aforementioned incident, the video publisher Meng apparently used identity labels such as &quot;leader&quot; and &quot;official&quot; to &quot;label&quot; the parties involved, Xu and Zhang, and then led the public to label &quot;corruption&quot; This impression was projected onto Xu and Zhang, disrupting the public&#39;s attention and judgment on the fact itself &quot;whether Zhang and Xu had an improper relationship between men and women,&quot; and ultimately achieved the goal of &quot;discrediting&quot; Zhang and Xu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that this farce of &quot;exposure&quot; and &quot;reporting&quot; directed and performed by Meng is a standard &quot;pan-moral criticism&quot;. Meng himself has moral problems, but he dares to make up unbridled stories. In fact, to conduct &quot;pan-moral criticism&quot; of others is to believe that once one occupies the high ground of &quot;justice&quot;, one has the privilege of unilaterally criticizing others without any moral questioning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moral sense is a social ideology that embodies the public’s pursuit of social fairness and justice. The purpose of moral criticism is to praise the beautiful and belittle the ugly, punish the evil and promote the good at the moral level, and then promote the social morality. improvement. However, this is not the case with &quot;pan-moral criticism&quot;. There are many grotesques and farces in which moral depravity stands on the high ground of &quot;justice&quot; and criticizes the moral depravity of others. &quot;Pan-moral criticism&quot; not only fails to promote the improvement of social morality, but also allows speculators to run rampant on the Internet, which not only causes the focus of public opinion supervision, but also creates a society where &quot;ruling the virtuous with no virtue&quot; Moral regression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said unceremoniously that &quot;pan-moral criticism&quot; is the alienation and distortion of &quot;moral criticism&quot;. Therefore, in a society, if the public is generally keen on &quot;pan-moral criticism&quot; and cannot extricate themselves, it will not only fail to improve social morality, but will lead to the regression and collapse of social morality. Netizens who believe that Meng&#39;s unjust behavior has a &quot;just&quot; result and therefore should not be punished or should be given a lighter punishment have actually been subtly influenced by Meng&#39;s &quot;pan-moral criticism&quot; trap. And unconsciously accepted such an alienated network morality. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Low-cost reporting&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In addition to &quot;pan-moral criticism&quot;, there is another problem in the incident of &quot;netizens posting videos to report that the woman had accompanied the leader to drink and lie drunk on the street many times&quot;: we Whether the society accepts &quot;video exposure&quot; as a low-cost &quot;reporting&quot; method? If this &quot;reporting&quot; method is established, should it be the same as other reporting channels, requiring the reporter to bear the corresponding responsibilities and consequences arising from the untrue content of the report? ? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The difficulty in defining whether &quot;video exposure&quot; behavior meets the definition of &quot;reporting&quot; is that it is not a point-to-point one-way transmission relationship between the whistleblower and the accepting agency like the traditional reporting method. Instead, they often start with a &quot;pan-moral criticism&quot; and ferment into public opinion on the Internet platform, forcing relevant departments to investigate. What ultimately responds to problems is often not the traditional petition and disciplinary inspection and supervision mechanisms, but the public opinion handling mechanism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This leads to a series of problems. First of all, because this method of &quot;reporting&quot; is not a traditional channel, it is difficult to be constrained and restricted by various regulations. Even if there are legal consequences, it is often punished for &quot;releasing false information to disrupt social and public order&quot;, and Their &quot;false accusations&quot; are difficult to pursue, which makes it possible for them to exploit loopholes in the system and corrupt the social atmosphere by evading the most important and minimizing the minor, writing essays and videos that are both true and false. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, this kind of &quot;forced reporting&quot; that uses the public opinion handling mechanism conducts a moral trial on the parties in advance before the relevant departments investigate, forming invisible pressure from public opinion to interfere with the investigation. Once the investigation is carried out, The results are inconsistent with the results of the moral trial, which can easily lead to public doubts and criticism of the investigation department and damage the credibility of the relevant departments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, once those with ulterior motives find that this reporting method is more &quot;effective&quot; than traditional channels, then the mentality of &quot;let the matter go unnoticed and someone else will take care of it&quot; will inevitably spread. Trivial matters in daily life and personal grievances rise to the level of morality, and then publicity and hype form online public opinions, which in turn force relevant departments to come forward to &quot;solve&quot; the problem. There will inevitably be more and more phenomena, and a large amount of social resources are forced to invest in endless meaningless investigations. In itself, it is a huge internal friction for society. It was just an accident that Meng’s false accusation was finally revealed. Our tireless pursuit of social fairness and justice must not rely on the false accusations of online accusers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 23 Oct 2023 22:25:17 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[大账高企小账不绝  银保业务何以常年畸形？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259167]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-23 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;As the channel business that contributes the largest premium to insurance companies, bancassurance is facing a new round of high pressure from regulations and new policies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 20, 2023, Liu Sheng, the person in charge of the personal insurance supervision work of the State Administration of Financial Supervision, said that the regulatory authorities will consistently do a good job in the work of &quot;unifying reporting and banking&quot;; insist on catching up early and small , grasp the typical cases, continue to strictly supervise and strengthen accountability, rectify industry chaos, and effectively safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of insurance consumers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 22, the Personal Insurance Department of the State Administration of Financial Supervision and Administration issued the &quot;Notice on Regulating Insurance Products through Bank Agency Channels&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Notice&quot;) to all personal insurance companies, requiring all When filing products, insurance companies should clearly state the cost assumptions and fee structure in the product actuarial report, and list the commission ceiling; each insurance company should truthfully list the commission rates paid to the bank, and the actual fees such as commissions should be compared with the filing materials. Stay consistent, that is, &quot;unity of reward and action.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the issuance of the &quot;Notice&quot;, the Shanghai Insurance Association has issued an industry self-discipline convention. Following the Notice, insurance industry associations in Guangdong and other places also issued a self-discipline convention for bancassurance business. Self-regulatory conventions in various places target stubborn problems such as high fees and disorderly competition in bancassurance channels, and strictly prohibit vicious price competition, commercial bribery and other illegal activities that disrupt the order of the bancassurance market. We promise not to covertly increase bancassurance business fees through other channels and methods, and resolutely put an end to small accounts in bancassurance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the pressure of supervision, it is imperative to reduce bank insurance fees. But why does the bancassurance business always suffer from the chronic industry problem of high large accounts and constant small accounts? It seems to be getting more and more popular as it becomes more banned. As early as August 27, 2019, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission had clearly stipulated in the &quot;Administrative Measures for the Insurance Agency Business of Commercial Banks&quot; that commercial banks &quot;may not collect or demand any benefits other than those agreed in the agreement in any way from insurance companies and their personnel.&quot; Under this round of high pressure, will the chaos in the banking and insurance channels end? Will the bank insurance premium rate difference that plagues insurance companies turn into a fee difference from now on? How do bancassurance alliances develop internationally? What are some lessons worth learning from? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center reviewed the development history of bancassurance at home and abroad, and used horizontal comparative research methods to find that the root cause of the &quot;big and small account problem&quot; lies in the profit distribution mechanism caused by the loose cooperation between insurance and banks. imbalance. Under this cooperation model, banks are driven by unilateral profits, and the overall business falls into a dilemma of incremental growth but no efficiency gain. Researchers from Southern Weekend&#39;s New Finance Research Center also visited different bank outlets as policyholders and conducted unannounced visits and found that the professionalism of bancassurance sales staff needs to be improved. Only when banks and bank employees transfer their focus on sales fees to professionalism will bank cooperation enter a new stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The stubborn problem of &quot;big and small accounts&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Bank insurance refers to a business model in which banks mainly sell insurance on their behalf. Together with personal agents and group insurance, it constitutes the main sales channel of insurance companies. Bancassurance is the core business of life insurance companies and the leading business of many small and medium-sized companies. In order to compete for premiums,&amp;nbsp;many small and medium-sized insurance companies have always maintained high-priced large accounts and various forms of small accounts, and many large companies have been passively involved in price wars. This is what the industry calls &quot;big and small accounts.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is &quot;big and small accounts&quot;? The &quot;big account&quot; refers to the handling fee agreed in the written contract between the insurance company and the bank, which is the bank&#39;s official income from the agency sales of insurance; the &quot;small account&quot; refers to the sales incentives privately given by the insurance company to bank staff, in various forms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as 2019, when talking about strict management of violations of regulations and disciplines at an internal meeting, the president of a joint-stock bank said that the one thing he could not tolerate the most was employees receiving kickbacks from insurance companies. In fact, regulatory agencies have also cracked down on small accounting issues many times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as August 27, 2019, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission had clearly stipulated in the &quot;Administrative Measures for the Insurance Agency Business of Commercial Banks&quot; that commercial banks &quot;may not collect or demand from insurance companies and their personnel in any way other than what is agreed in the agreement.&quot; any benefit”. Over the past few years, rectification has continued, but no significant results have been achieved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/OuOgJkoLFPDWFMaDwkIxlbWLwDEYesUm9fthHglI.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;1509&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/OuOgJkoLFPDWFMaDwkIxlbWLwDEYesUm9fthHglI.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255032&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Big accounts are high, small accounts are endless&quot; Why does it become a chronic disease? On the surface, the problem of &quot;big and small accounts&quot; is due to the strong position of banks and bancassurance cooperation due to their huge channels and strong customer resources. However, the root cause is that the interest distribution mechanism under the short-term and loose cooperation model between banks and insurance companies is insufficient. Reasonably caused. Banking and insurance are independent entities and there is no basis for equal cooperation between them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reasons for the strong position of banks are complicated, but in the financial market structure dominated by banks, it does not necessarily lead to the problem of &quot;big and small accounts&quot;. For example, in Europe, where the bancassurance business originated, in countries such as France and Italy, the bancassurance business not only accounts for a high proportion, but also makes a large contribution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, this is related to my country’s bancassurance cooperation model. Except for bank insurance companies and some giant insurance companies, the cooperation model between most banks and insurance companies is a &quot;many-to-many&quot; distribution agency model, that is, banks sign distribution agreements with insurance companies, and banks sell insurance through agency insurance companies. Products earn fees and commission income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under this model, the determination of business philosophy, development of bancassurance products and insurance claims settlement are all undertaken by the insurance company, and both bancassurance and bancassurance parties only carry out superficial cooperation based on channel-level factors such as marketing channels and customer resources. cooperation. From the perspective of contract theory, it is essentially a simple principal-agent relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Specifically, outside the bank, the insurance company serves as the principal and the bank acts as the agent. The two define each other&#39;s rights, obligations and interest distribution methods by signing a cooperation agreement. The main incentive mechanism of the contract is that the bank earns handling fees from the bancassurance agency business, while the insurer transfers part of the benefits in exchange for rapid expansion of premium income, thus forming the first level of entrustment-agency between the bank and the insurance company. relation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Within the bank, sales tasks are distributed layer by layer in the order of head office - branch branches - outlets, and the products are ultimately sold directly by bancassurance specialists at each outlet. According to the &quot;About Further Strengthening the Compliance of Commercial Banks&#39; Agency Insurance Business&quot; &quot;Notice on Sales and Risk Management&quot; stipulates that commercial banks shall not allow insurance company personnel to be stationed in bank branches. Therefore, relevant personnel of the insurance company can only supervise and assist bancassurance sales in the form of patrol points. A second principal-agent relationship is formed between the bank and its employees based on the sales of bancassurance products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a result, the sales intensity of sinking channels determines the amount of premiums to a large extent. Moreover, because of the existence of a double principal-agent relationship, the two parties have conflicting goals. Specifically, banks tend to sell single payment or short-term regular payment insurance products with high commission rates, simple terms and simple benefit demonstrations. As for the compatibility between customers and products, agents are not particularly concerned. However, regular payment insurance with long payment period and comprehensive protection functions is the type of insurance that insurance companies hope to sell because of its high intrinsic value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, insurance companies compete fiercely for banking channels. The &quot;Measures for the Administration of Insurance Agency Business of Commercial Banks&quot; promulgated in 2019 (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Measures&quot;) stipulates that each branch of a commercial bank can only cooperate with no more than 3 insurance companies in the insurance agency business in the same fiscal year, that is, &quot;1+ 3&quot; mode. The quality and configuration of banks’ sinking channels have become the focus of competition among insurance companies. Therefore, the Measures have to a certain extent intensified competition among insurance companies for banks’ high-quality channels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the context of serious product homogeneity, large accounts and small accounts have become an alternative competitive weapon. Liu Sheng commented that in recent years, the personal insurance industry has experienced severe homogeneous competition, and insurance companies generally have extensive expense management, resulting in actual expenses exceeding the level at the time of product filing, resulting in &quot;inconsistent reporting&quot;. High fees not only disrupt the market order, but are also the root cause of problems such as false fees, false insurance applications, and false surrenders. They are also the breeding ground for &quot;black agency products&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To what extent are bancassurance channel fees exaggerated? Liu Sheng revealed that as of October 20, the vast majority of banks carrying out bancassurance business have re-signed contracts with insurance companies in accordance with the requirements of &quot;unification of banks and banks&quot;. Preliminary estimates show that the commission rate for the bancassurance channel has dropped by about 30% compared with the previous average level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the results of the competition between &quot;big and small accounts&quot; is the fragmentation of market share. According to statistics from Guolian Securities, judging from the scale of bancassurance channel premiums of personal insurance companies, the market share of the top ten companies in bancassurance channel premiums has dropped from 59.9% in 2017 to 52.1% in 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Due to the intertwining of various reasons, the bancassurance channel has formed a status quo of &quot;high cost and low value&quot;. The bancassurance channel is also one of the channels where policyholders complain more. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers at the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center believe that the problem of &quot;big and small accounts&quot; is the intersection of history and reality, and is the product of the extensive development of the insurance industry in the past. In recent years, the insurance industry has received great attention in supporting economic and social development, and regulatory authorities have promoted deepening reforms in multiple key areas, including comprehensive system construction and core areas such as corporate governance, solvency, capital utilization, and consumer rights protection. The &quot;Notice&quot; releases a signal of reform, which will curb the industry&#39;s &quot;big and small accounts&quot; problem to a certain extent. However, whether the stubborn problem of &quot;big accounts, high prices, small accounts, and constant supply&quot; can be completely eradicated still depends on industry self-discipline, deepening cooperation between banks and insurance companies, and improving long-term incentive mechanisms. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Change&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Window period&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Why are the temporary management agencies stepping up their efforts to rectify the bancassurance business at this time? A researcher at the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center believes that the insurance industry has undergone major changes under the new situation, and this is a window period for reform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As far as the insurance industry is concerned, the agent team continues to shrink, and the growth rate of original premium income of the personal insurance industry is hovering at a low level. In 2022, the personal insurance industry will continue to be under pressure and enter a period of deep adjustment. That year, the original premium income of life insurance was 2.45 trillion yuan, a year-on-year increase of only 4%, accounting for 71.6% of personal insurance premiums. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/Ted4LW6uHu6upX9Pr6OsFDZHhV2Uc5wiKBxoBr6h.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;1509&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/Ted4LW6uHu6upX9Pr6OsFDZHhV2Uc5wiKBxoBr6h.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255034&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the public’s awareness of social security is gradually increasing The trend of aging and social aging still creates demand space for the development of the personal insurance industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of consumer behavior, insurance consumption has changed from &quot;should I buy it&quot; to &quot;is it good or not.&quot; The &quot;2022 China Internet Insurance Consumer Insight Report&quot; shows that consumers aged 31-40, mainly those born in the 1980s, spend more on insurance, and 75% of households spend more than 5,000 yuan on annual insurance. It can be seen that young consumers’ awareness of insurance and willingness to pay have increased significantly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From an operational perspective, some small and medium-sized insurance companies have relatively aggressive product pricing strategies, and some products have risks of long-term insurance and short-term insurance. At the same time, in the context of declining long-term interest rates and declining corporate investment yields, incremental whole life insurance with the function of locking long-term interest rates will expose insurance companies to the risk of spread losses. Data from China Chengxin International shows that in 2022, the insurance industry&#39;s investment return rate will drop to 3.8%, a decrease of 0.6 percentage points from 2021, which is significantly lower than the industry&#39;s average investment return rate of 5.3% in the past ten years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, the life insurance version of “interest rate cuts” has been implemented. Supervision has clearly provided window guidance. Before the end of July 2023, the predetermined interest rates for new personal insurance products will be adjusted. After dealing with the interest rate loss in the short term, how to solve the fee difference loss has become increasingly urgent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reform of bancassurance channels is a key measure to alleviate fee differences. What conditions are met for channel purification at this time? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center found through statistics and comparison that as of the end of 2022, the total number of agents of Ping An, China Life, China Pacific Insurance and New China Insurance was 1.59 million, down from 1.64 million in 2010 Thousands of people. The efficiency-improving reform of personal agency channels continues to show no significant results. At the same time, since 2020, major domestic listed insurance companies have been actively developing bancassurance channels, promoting the strategic transformation of &quot;new bancassurance&quot;, and have introduced a series of measures to strengthen the depth of cooperation with banks, hoping to achieve Growth in scale and value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/YNoRagCWoyIZy6owM3Nsbl1ehNwhFJkW3z4NSEkC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;824&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/YNoRagCWoyIZy6owM3Nsbl1ehNwhFJkW3z4NSEkC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255031&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take Ping An Life as an example, financial report data shows that, From 2019 to 2022, the growth rate of new policy premiums in the bancassurance channel was as high as 19.1%, significantly ahead of the individual insurance channel and other channels. The premium growth rates of the two during the same period were -10.1% and -7.5% respectively. The proportion of the company&#39;s new premiums increased from 4.2% in 2019 to 9.2% in 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This also shows that the agent channel that can best bring high intrinsic value policies to life insurance companies is still being adjusted. However, small and medium-sized insurance companies are basically unable to cultivate a large-scale agent team. In other words, the importance of the bancassurance channel has increased, highlighting the need for reform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Banks are also facing performance pressure. In a situation where interest spreads have shrunk, wealth management products have been depleted and trust products have become scarce, the agency insurance business has become a performance highlight. Take China Merchants Bank as an example. In 2022, China Merchants Bank&#39;s fund agency business revenue dropped by 46.4% year-on-year, and its proportion of non-interest income also dropped from the highest value of 13.0% in 2015 to 6.6%, while insurance agency sales revenue has remained at around 50% for two consecutive years. positive growth, and its proportion in non-interest income also increased significantly to 11.8%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/G9GBKprgogUlHMExIlVxAUdWI5O1QjROYAJ7tms1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;974&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/G9GBKprgogUlHMExIlVxAUdWI5O1QjROYAJ7tms1.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255033&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that the depth of both banks and insurance companies The window period for cooperation has arrived, and regulatory agencies and associations have the “right time, favorable location, and harmonious relationship” to crack down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center believe that from the perspective of insurance companies’ profit models, among the “three differences”, death and fee differences account for relatively small proportions. The &quot;Notice&quot; aims to standardize sales expenses and prevent unfair competition. It is one of the important measures to standardize insurance sales behavior in a multi-dimensional and systematic manner. Following the &quot;Notice&quot;, the &quot;Insurance Sales Behavior Management Measures&quot; recently issued by the State Administration of Financial Supervision will be implemented from March 1, 2024. The &quot;Measures&quot; echo the &quot;Plan for the Construction of the Sales Ability Qualification Grading System for Insurance Sales Practitioners&quot; previously issued by the Insurance Industry Association, and aim to guide insurance companies to establish a product grading and channel grading system that matches customer needs. With the combined efforts of multiple measures, the results of this round of bancassurance channel rectification are worth looking forward to. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Overseas Bancassurance&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Close&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Type&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Cooperation&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Bank Insurance It has existed abroad for more than 60 years. What can we learn from it? Researchers from Southern Weekend&#39;s New Finance Research Center found out that there are two theories about the origin of bancassurance: one is Britain in the 1960s; the other is France in the 1970s. However, the development of bancassurance business in Britain and France is quite different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;New Bancassurance Era: The Beginning of Value&quot; released by Deloitte in 2023 shows that bancassurance channels in France, Italy and Spain account for 64%, 74% and 60% of all premiums respectively. %. Among Asian countries, South Korea accounts for 50%, Indonesia accounts for 48%, Singapore accounts for 30%, and India accounts for 25%. The UK bancassurance business has developed slowly and mainly relies on insurance broker channels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the evolution of cooperation models in various countries, four bancassurance business cooperation models, namely agreement agency, strategic alliance, capital cooperation and financial group, have proven to be quite successful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/XyLiWZmPSs8wjHkxV4pG5kt5zLfSUZwE5GzmMaBW.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1535&quot; height= &quot;3358&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/XyLiWZmPSs8wjHkxV4pG5kt5zLfSUZwE5GzmMaBW.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255035&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take France as an example. Banks enter the bancassurance field mainly by controlling insurance companies. Banks control insurance companies in two ways: establishing self-owned subsidiaries and acquiring other insurance companies, with the former being the main form. In terms of products, simplified and standardized life insurance or savings products are the main products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Banking and insurance in Hong Kong, China also implement mixed operations, and large banks build their own insurance companies to achieve bancassurance synergy. The same is true for Taiwan, China. Bancassurance is mostly carried out in the form of a financial holding company. Its insurance product sales channels mainly include joint marketing through financial holding companies and strategic alliances, that is, business cooperation promotion through financial institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Overseas experience shows that the development process of bancassurance is a process of banks and insurance companies jointly exploring consumer needs. It is a common choice for banks and insurance companies to choose the path of bancassurance cooperation and provide bancassurance products that meet the diverse needs of consumers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of development experience, the global bancassurance industry has experienced three stages: bancassurance, insurance banking and universal finance. They are essentially the cross-penetration, mutual integration, mutual complementation and common development of banks and insurance companies in many aspects such as product research and development, sales channels, organizational forms and business strategies, that is, the mixed operation of banks and insurance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the development models of bancassurance vary in different countries and regions. In other words, there is no universally applicable bancassurance development model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center believe that my country’s bancassurance started relatively late but is developing rapidly. Data from the &quot;Insurance Yearbook&quot; show that in 2010, China&#39;s bancassurance channel premium income accounted for 50% of life insurance premium income, which was the highest in history. However, the cooperation between banks and insurance companies has always been based on the sales agreement model, and the cooperative relationship between banks and insurance companies is relatively loose. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This model has obvious shortcomings. First, bancassurance cooperation is limited to the sales level, and there is a lack of motivation to jointly develop products; second, banks only act as agents for insurance products to obtain agency fees, and the cooperation between the two parties is short-term and unstable. Third, driven by short-term financial goals, both parties lacked enthusiasm in cultivating bancassurance professionals, resulting in low bancassurance service levels and frequent misleading sales problems. Therefore, my country’s banking and insurance cooperation model needs to be further deepened. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Explore new ways of bancassurance cooperation&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to establish a healthy and win-win bancassurance ecosystem? The development experience of overseas banking and insurance shows that the financial legal environment and the form of organizational cooperation are crucial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, the banking and insurance industries are under the unified supervision of the State Administration of Financial Supervision, and the regulatory coordination of the two industries will be smoother. At the same time, banks’ huge channels and strong customer resources are excellent channels for bancassurance to acquire customers. In addition, after years of market education, people generally have insurance awareness. Bank customers are naturally aware of financial management, and the question has changed from &quot;whether to buy&quot; to &quot;which product to buy&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, for insurance companies and banks, the customer acquisition cost advantage of the bancassurance channel will exist for a long time. It is still the main channel for insurance companies, especially small and medium-sized insurance companies, and it is not to be underestimated in banks’ collection business. field of. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to build a new cooperation method for banks and insurance? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers at the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center believe that judging from overseas experience, the four models each have their own merits. At this stage, we can appropriately promote the development of in-depth bancassurance cooperation models. Those who have the conditions can try it at a higher level. my country&#39;s bancassurance development model has transformed from a sales agreement model to a strategic alliance model. In the future cooperation between bancassurance and insurance, the following points should be implemented: &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1. In terms of business philosophy, both bancassurance and bancassurance parties should completely transform the extensive operation that puts scale first, and truly shift from &quot;sales-centered&quot; to &quot;sales-centered&quot; Customer-centric&quot;. This will help both banks and insurance companies reach a consensus and shift to long-term business goals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2. In terms of cooperation methods, promote the transformation and upgrading of bancassurance cooperation. On the one hand, through strategic alliances between banks and insurance companies, &quot;capital integration&quot; and other methods, the constraint mechanism for the distribution of interests between banks and insurance companies will be reconstructed, and the &quot;discourse power&quot; of insurers in bank-insurance cooperation will be enhanced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of laws and regulations, it is recommended to further optimize relevant laws and regulations. Objectively speaking, under the &quot;1+3&quot; model, the cooperative business relationship between banks and insurance is not stable, which increases the coordination costs between the two parties and exacerbates the inequality between the two parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 23 Oct 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
