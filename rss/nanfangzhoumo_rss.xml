Wang Xing, a defense lawyer from Beijing, questioned the identity of one of the prosecutors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, according to the system of calling prosecutors from different places (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 混体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;abbreviated as &quot;referred to as &quot;remote prosecutors&quot;&lt;/span>;), the higher-level procuratorate can Prosecutors from lower-level procuratorates within the jurisdiction are called to handle cases on behalf of the court, and the called prosecutors can also be assigned to other lower-level procuratorates to handle cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem is that according to relevant laws, Chinese prosecutors have regional attributes, and the prerequisite for performing their duties is to be appointed by the standing committee of the local people&#39;s congress. For example, if the municipal procuratorate wants to transfer an prosecutor from District A Procuratorate to District B Procuratorate to handle a case, it should first remove the person from being a prosecutor from District A Procuratorate through the Municipal People&#39;s Congress Standing Committee, and then appoint him or her as an prosecutor from District B Procuratorate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In previous practice, higher-level procuratorial organs often directly called prosecutors from lower-level procuratorates without going through the Standing Committee of the People’s Congress at the same level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The common feeling among lawyers is that when they raised objections to the identity of the prosecutor transferred from another place, the prosecutor either ignored it or said, &quot;It is under the dual leadership of the superior procuratorate and the local congress standing committee, so the superior The court has the right to invoke&quot; as a defense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But this time, the attitude of the prosecutor opposite Wang Xing was obviously relaxed. He made it clear that he would resolve the identity issue in accordance with the new regulations. &quot;If the appointment process of the local congress standing committee has not been completed by the time the court opens, he will not speak in court.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The new regulations refer to the highest The &quot;Regulations on Several Issues Concerning the Unified Dispatch of Prosecutorial Personnel from the Jurisdiction to Handle Cases by the People&#39;s Procuratorate at Higher Levels&quot; issued by the People&#39;s Procuratorate on September 5, 2023 stipulates that if the transferred prosecutors want to perform their duties as prosecutors, such as appearing in court to support public prosecutions, they need to In accordance with the law, the Standing Committee of the People&#39;s Congress at the same level shall be asked to make appointments in accordance with legal procedures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The promulgation of this regulation means that the &quot;war of words&quot; between academic and practical circles over the off-site inspection system has come to an end. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Legal Identity&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As early as December 28, 2022, the Legal Affairs Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress reported on the 2022 filing review work situation that the prosecutors were called from other places. It requested that “relevant appointment decisions must be made by the Standing Committee of the People’s Congress at the corresponding level” and stated that “research opinions have been submitted to the relevant formulation agencies and it is recommended that they be considered.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the nine months since the new regulations were promulgated, some local prosecutors’ offices have accepted lawyers’ objections to the use of off-site inspections. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2023, Wang Xing also met two prosecutors from districts and counties at a pre-trial meeting on a fraud case prosecuted by the Yibin City Procuratorate in Sichuan Province. The prosecutor wanted to express his opinion, but Wang Xing told the judge directly: &quot;If he disagrees, don&#39;t let him speak until the issue (their qualifications) is resolved, so as not to invalidate the pre-trial conference.&quot; April 19, 2023 , the Standing Committee of the Yibin Municipal People’s Congress publicly appointed these two people as prosecutors of the Yibin Municipal People’s Procuratorate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the &quot;boot&quot; was launched, a prosecutor from a municipal procuratorate in the southwest region told Southern Weekend: &quot;New regulations have been introduced, and (offsite inspections) must follow the regulations in principle. If they do not comply, once the lawyer proposes When it comes to the identity of prosecutors, the procuratorate will be very passive.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Specifically, the new regulations stipulate the applicable circumstances for the use of off-site prosecutors, that is, when there are a large number of people involved in the case and the case is particularly serious and complex, And when the case handling capacity is difficult to bear, the superior court can uniformly call on prosecutors from the jurisdiction. Among them, prosecutors from higher-level courts can be sent to lower-level courts to handle cases, and prosecutors from lower-level courts can be transferred to higher-level courts, or to lower-level courts within their jurisdiction for support. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most important thing is that the new regulations standardize the calling procedures for remote inspections. Article 7 stipulates that once the case is settled, or the higher court terminates the call, the prosecutor will be removed from the aforementioned duties according to procedures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The new regulations also take into account some exceptions. If a prosecutor from a higher court is transferred to a lower court within its jurisdiction; or if a higher court transfers a branch of its own court or dispatches a prosecutor from the procuratorate to its own court or another branch of this court or dispatches a procuratorate, it does not need to perform the prosecutor appointment procedures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A grassroots prosecutor told Southern Weekly that before this, when a higher court issued a transfer order, he had to go to the brother court at the same level to handle the case. The transfer period was usually three months, and he also I knew that &quot;the case investigators were seconded elsewhere and were not appointed by the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress, so I actually had no legal status.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the National People’s Congress Standing Committee usually only arranges a meeting every two months, it may not be able to meet the prosecutor’s time limit for handling cases. The remedy provided by the new regulations is that before the local Congress Standing Committee makes an appointment, the prosecutor who is called can assist in handling the case as an assistant prosecutor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the case of Chen in Honghe, Yunnan, who was suspected of picking quarrels and provoking trouble, the Honghe Prefecture Procuratorate transferred all six prosecutors at one time to assistant prosecutors to assist in completing court proceedings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the opinions of the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate expert group, the biggest difference between prosecutors and assistant prosecutors is that important court duties such as reading out the indictment, interrogation, interrogation, cross-examination, defense and issuing opinions in court should be performed by the prosecutor. The former performs it in person; while the latter can only follow instructions and engage in supplementary and auxiliary work such as reading out evidence and assisting in multimedia demonstrations. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Repeatedly caught in the whirlpool of public opinion&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Before the filing and review opinions of the Legal Affairs Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress were made public, &quot;off-site inspection&quot; has repeatedly fallen into the whirlpool of public opinion in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2020, the gang-related case of Wang Yongming in Baotou City, Inner Mongolia put the focus on off-site inspection. During the first trial of Wang Yongming&#39;s case, the defense lawyer reported in court that a prosecutor was suspected of soliciting bribes. Subsequently, the case was assigned jurisdiction by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region High Court and transferred to the Wuda District Court of Wuhai City for trial. During this period, the Procuratorate of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region mobilized 18 prosecutors and assistant prosecutors from across the autonomous region to form a public prosecution team. Some skeptics pointed out that the practice of prosecutors from the autonomous region procuratorate joining the public prosecutor team and appearing in court to support the prosecution would lead to an imbalance in prosecution and trial and violate procedural justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar to the Wang Yongming case, in the &quot;Fraud Case of Xie Liuqing and Other 63 People&quot; in Wuhu, Anhui, the procuratorate also formed a &quot;public prosecution team&quot; to appear in court. Because 42 of the defendants were found not guilty in the first instance of the case, the Wuhu Fanchang District Procuratorate filed a protest. In October 2021, during the second trial of the case, the list of persons appearing in court from the Procuratorate was circulated online. Among the public prosecutors, in addition to personnel from various grassroots procuratorial systems in Wuhu City, they also include personnel from the procuratorial systems in Hefei City, Tongling City and other provinces, totaling 11 prosecutors and 2 clerks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This approach has caused great controversy. &quot;Whether the off-site inspection system is legal and constitutional&quot; has once again been put in the spotlight and has become an issue that cannot be ignored by relevant departments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Wang Xing’s impression, in some major difficult or gang-related cases, it is “common” to use inspections in other places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The evolution of off-site prosecution first started with the unified calling of outstanding public prosecutors in the jurisdiction. The &quot;Opinions on Further Strengthening Public Prosecutions and Strengthening Legal Supervision&quot; issued by the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate in June 2005 mentioned that &quot;the People&#39;s Procuratorate at a higher level may select and deploy outstanding public prosecutors or business backbones to handle major and complex cases based on the needs of case handling.&quot; In 2011, the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate promulgated the &quot;Regulations on Deploying Excellent Public Prosecutors to Handle Major Public Prosecution Cases (Trial)&quot;, which stipulates that if necessary, outstanding public prosecutors in the jurisdiction can be deployed to handle cases. The newly revised &quot;Organic Law of the People&#39;s Procuratorate of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; in 2018 officially clarified the off-site prosecutorial system in the form of legislation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of many legal scholars such as Long Zongzhi and Han Xu of Sichuan University, the off-site prosecutorial system is designed to meet the needs of prosecutors and case handling. First, after the reform of the quota system, prosecutors who have the power to handle cases The number has been significantly reduced compared with the past. On the other hand, with the frequent occurrence of major, difficult and socially sensitive cases, it is difficult for grassroots prosecutors to complete their charging tasks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of Zhang Jianwei, a professor at Tsinghua University Law School, the introduction of this system is in response to new changes in the form of defense: in major and sensitive cases, as well as in many corruption or anti-gang cases, out-of-town defense The involvement of lawyers has increased, especially the number of well-known lawyers taking on defense roles, which requires procuratorial organs in various places to respond with a higher level of public prosecutions; on the other hand, lawyers have formed teams to defend co-defendants involved in the case, breaking the past tradition of each acting independently and acting independently. The form of defense brings great challenges to grassroots procuratorial organs. In order to improve the level of public prosecutions and cope with new changes in the prosecution and defense situation, the procuratorial organs have deployed elite soldiers to undertake public prosecutions in the future, thereby ensuring the quality of public prosecutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no dispute over the rationality of using off-site inspections. The disagreement lies in how to use it. There have always been voices within the prosecution system that hope to refine the regulations. Long Zongzhi, a professor at Sichuan University Law School, mentioned in an article: During the revision of the &quot;People&#39;s Procuratorate Criminal Procedure Rules&quot; in 2019, many provincial procuratorates hope to clarify the scope, procedures and prosecutors&#39; responsibilities of unified calls. However, the author believes that &quot;from the current point of view, further experience needs to be summarized on how to call it specifically.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image /23/10/19/YvHZdv9yPLrNkeO1GlGgHfunUjzyC8A8h76MYB01.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19 /YvHZdv9yPLrNkeO1GlGgHfunUjzyC8A8h76MYB01.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254543&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate issued &quot;About the Higher People&#39;s Procuratorate&quot; on September 5, 2023 Provisions on the unified deployment of prosecutors in jurisdictions to handle certain issues in cases.&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(People&#39;s Vision/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;There are different opinions&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In Han Xu&#39;s view, the new inspection regulations for remote use The introduction of the law is not unrelated to the supervision of the National People&#39;s Congress, the voice of the academic community, and the review suggestions raised by lawyers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One year before the prosecutor in the second instance of Xie Liuqing’s case was determined, lawyer Gan Weidong wrote a letter to the Supreme People’s Procuratorate. He quoted at the beginning the second paragraph of Article 9 of the “People’s Procuratorate’s Criminal Procedure Rules”: The decision to call should be made in writing, and the prosecutor who is called can perform various procuratorial duties such as appearing in court to support public prosecutions on behalf of the People&#39;s Procuratorate handling the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I think this provision is both unconstitutional and has no basis in superior laws.&quot; He wrote bluntly in the letter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Doing so means that prosecutors can break through the jurisdiction of the National People&#39;s Congress Standing Committee to handle cases in non-appointment jurisdictions, which directly undermines the People&#39;s Congress system.&quot; Gan Weidong told Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On December 4, 2020, the Supreme People’s Procuratorate 12309 Procuratorial Service Center gave a detailed reply to Qian Weidong, clearly stating that when higher-level procuratorates call prosecutors from lower-level procuratorates to handle cases, they can indeed go to the local congress standing committee. appointment procedures, but in practice it is often difficult to meet the needs of case handling, and even leads to case handling being overdue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, some local prosecutors appointed transferred personnel as assistant prosecutors of the court. This temporary status belongs to the prosecutor, but does not need to be appointed or removed by the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress. With the advancement of the reform of classified management of prosecutors and the reform of the prosecutor quota system, the position of assistant prosecutor has been eliminated, and the transfer of prosecutors to perform their duties in other places has become a problem. In order to solve the legality of using prosecutors in other places, when the Organic Law of the People&#39;s Procuratorate was revised in 2018, it was clearly stipulated that the People&#39;s Procuratorate at a higher level &quot;can uniformly call prosecutors in the jurisdiction to handle cases.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Han Xu said that the unconditional &quot;remote inspection&quot; does not have legal legitimacy. However, since laws and judicial interpretations have established this system from the institutional level, &quot;off-site inspections should be used as little as possible and should not become the norm but only the exception.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 11, 2021, during the second trial of Xie Liuqing’s case, lawyers Wang Xing and Shen Yachuan submitted a request to the National People’s Congress Standing Committee to review the legality of the off-site prosecution clause in the “People’s Procuratorate’s Criminal Procedure Rules”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the alleged violation of the provisions of the Standing Committee of the People&#39;s Congress at all levels on the appointment of prosecutors, the two lawyers also mentioned that the use of prosecutors in other places also violates the principle of criminal trial level jurisdiction and leads to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law. Avoid problems such as the inability of the system to be implemented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than a year after receiving the filing and review suggestions, the Legal Affairs Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress responded to the lawyers’ suggestions in the filing and review work report released on December 28, 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A scholar with knowledge of the situation revealed: “After the opinion of the Legal Affairs Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on the need for the approval of the appointment of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee for the deployment of prosecutors came out, there were different opinions, but the Legal Affairs Committee insisted on moving to another location. Appointments must be approved by the local People’s Congress Standing Committee.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;How to solve the remaining problems? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;With the introduction of new regulations by the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, the procedures for using inspections in other places are no longer controversial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The question that practitioners are most concerned about now is how to deal with cases that have previously been handled by prosecutors without following the opinions of the Legal Affairs Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;two highs&quot; also noticed this. On September 15, 2023, 10 days after the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate issued the new regulations, the &quot;two highs&quot; jointly issued the &quot;Notice on Issues Concerning the Unified Dispatch of Prosecutorial Personnel from the Jurisdiction to Handle Cases by the People&#39;s Procuratorates at Higher Levels&quot;, which clearly mentioned that for cases that have taken effect Judgment: If the complainant files a complaint on the grounds that the prosecutor who was transferred has not been appointed by the Standing Committee of the People&#39;s Congress at the same level, and does not meet the circumstances that require a new trial under the Criminal Procedure Law, the complainant must be persuaded to withdraw the complaint; if he persists in the complaint, he shall be notified in writing. turn down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The notice also stipulates that for cases that have entered the second instance procedure, the second instance court shall not revoke the original ruling and remand the case for retrial on the grounds that the prosecutor called during the first instance was not appointed by the Standing Committee of the People&#39;s Congress at the same level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Han Xu still has questions: Who will lead and supervise the prosecutor who was called? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He noticed that some prosecutors from higher-level procuratorates who were transferred to other places may have a higher rank than the chief prosecutor of the local procuratorate. As a result, it would be difficult for the chief prosecutor of the local procuratorate to lead the prosecutors of the higher-level procuratorate. . He has researched prosecutors who participated in &quot;off-site prosecution&quot; and found that in practice, there are indeed situations where &quot;higher-level procuratorate prosecutors who are transferred to lower-level procuratorates do not dare to supervise or have lax supervision because of their higher rank.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also, when the called prosecutor is not suitable to continue participating in the case, who will make the decision to recuse himself? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The new regulations mention that if it is discovered during the handling of a case that the prosecutor being called has circumstances that require him to recuse himself as required by law, the prosecutor being called should recuse himself, and the parties and their legal representatives have the right to request that they recuse themselves. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, according to the Criminal Procedure Law, the chief prosecutor should be responsible for the recusal of prosecutors. However, prosecutors who are transferred from other places are usually decided by the superior prosecutorial agency. In this case, whether the recusal of the transferred person is decided by the prosecutor general of the superior procuratorial agency or by the prosecutor general of the prosecutor&#39;s office where he is transferred? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Jianwei&#39;s point of view is that because the call is often decided by the superior procuratorate, if there is a situation where the prosecutor needs to recuse himself during the call, then &quot;whoever dispatches the prosecutor will decide to recuse himself&quot;; but if the prosecutor is called When personnel have begun handling cases on behalf of the procuratorate to which a specific case belongs, &quot;for the sake of efficiency, the issue of recusal should be decided by the chief prosecutor of the procuratorate handling the case.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for whether relevant departments will issue more detailed judicial interpretations or corresponding regulations for off-site inspections in the future, Zhang Jianwei, who once served as deputy director of the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, expressed his expectation, but has not yet done so. Hear about the plans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[警方通报男子当街性侵醉酒女子：网传信息不属实]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258863]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 14:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/19/lREj0mw3STng0v2EnzvQY0D3hMsQdkBAAiocNZ9O.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2008&quot; height=&quot;4631&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/lREj0mw3STng0v2EnzvQY0D3hMsQd kBAAiocNZ9O. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254586&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 14:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[老年相亲的奇观，“等你老了就明白了”｜记者手记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258792]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73058&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;69896&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/c79f0bdf96.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;a0567795b9e103e6d94ea8797e82c17.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;September 2023, Shanghai, IKEA restaurant Elderly people inside.

Take a deep breath, try to reverse your tired state, and cheer up to deal with a new group - a group of old single Shanghainese, who will definitely be bored. But to my surprise, they were much more interesting than I imagined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;First, a man in sunglasses who was over sixty years old came up to me and greeted me. He thought I was looking for company. After all, there are many young women coming to this place.&quot; fishing&quot;.

He raised his head and began to sigh, &quot;How much time does a person have to wait for your love?

Many people have not found a partner, left, and are eclipsed.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Indeed, straight to the point is The characteristic here is that everyone talks about their conditions, including financial conditions, physical conditions, physiological needs, etc. After a few sentences, it is clear what the other party is after. 68-year-old Hong Jianming said that everyone knows what level it should go to. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Hong Jianming said that the water here is very deep. Men want women to be beautiful, and women want men to be rich. &quot;You see, I am so handsome, but I have not found a partner. Because they know that I can’t support them.” I spent four afternoons in the IKEA restaurant, and most of the people I met described it to me as a dangerous place with all kinds of traps. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are many stories of &quot;liars&quot; circulating here, and the ones most likely to fall for them are Shanghai seniors over eighty years old. &quot;There is a woman in her 30s and 40s who comes here specifically to deceive people in their 70s and 80s. The older the better, the sooner she will die. She just bought several houses like this.&quot; Several women gathered around me and started talking. A common trick used by female swindlers is to make the elderly &quot;take the bait&quot; first with their young and beautiful appearance. Marriage is the most critical step in dividing the property. Frequent sex can accelerate the decline of the elderly, and the steps are steady and ruthless. A woman next to her with heavy black eye shadow interrupted, &quot;Pretty girls are all liars and will kill the old man.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Men seeking mates also believe in this trick. Conspiracy theories, on the one hand, they want to expose their wealth as much as possible to attract the attention of women; on the other hand, they must always be on guard to prevent the bad guys from succeeding. Similarly, there are also &quot;liars&quot; among men who have other agendas. They &quot;fish&quot; by exaggerating their financial resources just to sleep with the women who &quot;take the bait&quot;. From time to time there are men who get into fights in restaurants over a woman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Nevertheless, they will still dive into the IKEA restaurant without hesitation, because &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; is just the tip of the iceberg here. In the past few years, the staff of the IKEA restaurant tried several times to drive these loud and noisy old people out of the area, but failed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The elderly are too lonely. These people we have now can still walk, but we won&#39;t know in a few years.&quot; Hong Jianming said this As we were talking, a gray-haired old man was passing by in front of us, using a cane to move step by step, &quot;You see, this kind of old man is so weird. What is he doing here? He is just bored. Listen and see.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;IKEA restaurant brings them more than just a place to listen and see. Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, someone will organize everyone to have dinner together, especially restaurants that have special offers on Tuesdays. For example, one restaurant will give away a plate of stir-fried beef cubes worth 138 yuan on Tuesday. It is delicately placed on one end of a smooth rectangular plate with more than a dozen beef cubes. For this free signature dish, they have paid Been here dozens of times. There are more people, more food, and it’s cheaper. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 19, I came to the IKEA restaurant for the third time. I learned that someone here had organized everyone to travel to other places together, and everyone contributed some money. They are an elderly group, taking care of each other; I also saw them talking about sex and love boldly here, even to the point of making the people discussing it red-faced, but when they went out, no one knew each other. Without that atmosphere, it would be difficult to say some words. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After dinner that day, Hong Jianming, who had always been very humorous, suddenly told me in a serious tone that he often came out of the poker hall at around 1 o&#39;clock in the morning, and would Walk around the IKEA restaurant and People&#39;s Park and chat with people. In the bottom of his heart, he actually looked down on the group of old people in front of him who only talked about trivial matters. They were incomparable with his colleagues at his previous job, but there was nothing he could do about it when he was old. When he retired and got sick, he had to retire to the place where old people should go. place, go to the old people to seek a sense of identity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What disappoints Hong Jianming the most is that his son dislikes him. &quot;He didn&#39;t explicitly say he disliked me, but I am his father. I don&#39;t know he is there yet.&quot; What are you thinking about? Pretending to be useless.&quot; Every time his son came home to visit him with something, the two of them would repeat a scene: the son would look at his watch from time to time and quickly find an excuse to leave, &quot;I said you can leave, and he would immediately gone&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Hong Jianming can see his son&#39;s dislike in all aspects. His son would never take the initiative to call and ask; his calls to his son were rarely answered, and his son would suddenly call him after a long time and ask him, &quot;What&#39;s the matter, Dad? I was busy in front of me and didn&#39;t hear you.&quot; It was always the same. so. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are too many examples like this in IKEA restaurants. I learned from several people one after another that they had children and finally arrived. In his twilight years, he still has to live alone, with the house and pension in his hands being his last source of confidence. The IKEA restaurant is just a microcosm of the elderly group. You can imagine the phenomenon outside this place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 21, I went to the IKEA restaurant for the last time. Until 9:30 in the evening, there were still four old people staying in the restaurant chatting. They said they couldn&#39;t sleep even after returning and it was good to chat. They said that I was still young and did not understand how powerless it felt to push time towards the end. I have heard this sentence several times: &quot;You will understand when you are old.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align : left;&quot;>;I really can’t empathize with it, I just think the topic is heavy. On the other hand, although in their mouths, 80-year-old Song Xiaofei is a confused person who gave 8,000 yuan of his pension to a 40-year-old out-of-town woman just to let her accompany him; 78-year-old Lao Zhang is also a confused person. Man, spending 300 yuan a day on a young woman to keep you company is a waste of money. But in my opinion, maybe it is rare to be sober. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After all, when people reach their twilight years, there is not much time left. &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[视频教你坐地铁：面向全国数亿人的“社会生存学”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258812]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Uncle Chen has been working in Guangdong for more than ten years and almost never takes the subway. If the new construction site hadn&#39;t happened to be near a subway station, Uncle Chen wouldn&#39;t have walked in, even though it was Tiyu West Road, the largest subway station in Asia that handles nearly a million passengers every day. Because he still hasn&#39;t understood the rules of taking the subway. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally arrived at the platform of Tiyu West Road Station. Uncle Chen was carrying a bag of quilts in one hand and a bucket in the other hand, which contained towels, shower gel and other daily necessities, and asked the strangers around him for directions. ——He was going to take the subway to work near Shipaiqiao subway station, which was just one stop away. Uncle Chen is from Hubei. He and his wife rent in Fushan Village, Huangpu District, more than 30 kilometers away from the center of Guangzhou. He usually works as a temporary worker at construction sites in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai and other places. The nearest subway station is 3 kilometers away from his residence. When he goes to work, he usually takes a bus or a taxi, even though the former is a long journey and the latter is expensive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“You can’t ride the subway for long, and it’s very troublesome to go around in circles.” Uncle Chen said. His two daughters worked outside the home, and no one taught him how to confirm the route, transfer trains, or find the station. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/ZOmMx5fvos11SE1narzVKAxCdNCwHi2GycsiJY95.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height= &quot;683&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/ZOmMx5fvos11SE1narzVKAxCdNCwHi2GycsiJY95.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254371&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In June 2023, at Xiuyi Station of Suzhou Rail Transit Line 11, citizens were checking the subway line map and buying tickets by themselves. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhou Heng, who is studying urban rail operation management at an engineering college in Hunan, is about to graduate. Just took the subway for the first time. In the first month of college, the teacher asked in class if any students had never taken the subway. There were 42 people in the class, and one-third of them raised their hands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Out of surprise, the teacher asked a girl who had ridden the subway to share her feelings. The girl said that the subway was fast, comfortable and convenient. &quot;I was very envious at the time. I had never seen this thing before,&quot; Zhou Heng said. In his hometown and the city where he goes to school, public transportation is not very developed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, teachers still asked the same questions in class from time to time, but almost no one raised their hands anymore. &quot;At that time, I was actually too embarrassed to admit it,&quot; Zhou Heng said, &quot;After all, I learned this by myself.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first time Zhou Heng walked into a subway station was when he traveled to Nanchang with his classmates in his sophomore year. He found that the subway was a little different from what he imagined. It was not as quiet and comfortable as the girl described. It was very crowded during peak hours, the carriages vibrated obviously, and it was very noisy while driving. But he was still very interested and curiously paid attention to the layout of the station and the location of the escape routes. After arriving at the station, they remembered the subway driving process they had just learned in class, and stayed on the platform for a while, waiting to see the driver come out of the cockpit after the door closed, get out of the car, check, and then return to the car. They also took photos. Send the video to the teacher. &quot;The teacher praised us for being studious,&quot; Zhou Heng said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;You are 20 years old and have never taken the subway. Are you a failure?&quot; This is one of the most popular comments on David&#39;s video. He made a short video of the process of taking the subway and taught others how to transfer and find the station on social media. There are many &quot;traffic bloggers&quot; similar to him. Search for &quot;subway riding tutorial&quot; and the city name on the short video platform to find subway teaching videos in various cities. If you still don&#39;t understand, you can ask questions in the comment area. , and received precise answers from bloggers and enthusiastic netizens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Type &quot;how many people in China have never taken the subway&quot; in the search engine, and the answer is &quot;900 million&quot; (Editor&#39;s note: As of September 2023, the 2022 permanent population of all cities in mainland China with subway access The total is 499 million). What does a subway mean to the silent majority? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Those who have never ridden the subway know nothing”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;For many people who have never ridden the subway, the first thing to break through is the psychological barrier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ronaldiner works in Chengdu, and his parents have been working in Aba Prefecture, Sichuan for a long time. During the Chinese New Year in 2023, Ronaldinho asked her mother to accompany her from Chengdu to Chongqing. When she proposed to take the subway to the high-speed rail station, her mother refused and asked for a taxi. Ronaldinho didn&#39;t understand that taking a taxi was expensive and crowded, so he argued with his mother. In the end, her mother was a little embarrassed and said that she had never taken the subway and didn&#39;t know how to take it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ronaldiner said simply: &quot;Then I will teach you.&quot; The mother was stunned for a moment, as if she was surprised that her daughter did not laugh at her. The dispute ended with Ronaldinho convincing his mother to accept the instruction. The two rehearsed the entire process at the entrance. The mother asked many questions: how to apply for the bus code and how to use it; water bottles, sunscreen spray, fruit knife, red wine Can I bring a bottle opener? The two of them squatted on the ground and took out the items in the suitcase one by one and counted them. &quot;I was shocked at the time. My mother really didn&#39;t understand this aspect at all. I felt like I didn&#39;t even understand her life.&quot; Ronaldinho said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After getting on the subway, my mother became taciturn. When Ronaldinho explained the details of the ride to her, he just responded with a &quot;hmm&quot;. &quot;She would have a lot of questions before getting on the bus, but when she got inside, although she wanted to ask, she was too embarrassed to ask, so she didn&#39;t speak.&quot; She silently sent a text to Ronaldinho on WeChat, asking when and when she got off the bus. How to go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After scanning the QR code and exiting the station, my mother opened Alipay and found that only a few yuan had been deducted. She was surprised and said that taking the subway was so much cheaper than taking a taxi. &quot;I won&#39;t take a taxi anymore. I&#39;ll take the subway from now on,&quot; my mother said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/PwLFZSK0QQPfaNPb6iyu10WhveY0jy4sUqGYM6xm.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height= &quot;683&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/PwLFZSK0QQPfaNPb6iyu10WhveY0jy4sUqGYM6xm.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254370&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The earliest subway in the world was the London Metropolitan Subway in 1863, which has a history of 160 years ago. The picture shows the first phase of Lanzhou Rail Transit Line 2 in trial operation in June 2023. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;They don&#39;t know how to look up the map.&quot; He Jingtao said. He works at a travel agency in Guangzhou. In the two months since he created city subway guides on social media, He Jingtao has become half a &quot;traffic help blogger.&quot; He estimated that in the past two months, he had replied to more than 700 people in the comment area alone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many of the people who come to him for help come from other places to study or travel in Guangzhou. They don’t know that they can check the subway lines on the map because they don’t need to use mobile phone navigation in the local area. Therefore, the question he is asked the most is how to take the subway from the train station to a certain place or business district, or from one district to another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiaojun is one of them. When asking He Jingtao for help, she only sent him the name of the school, but she was confused about how to take the subway from the train station to the school: She was from Huizhou, Guangdong, and was about to go to Guangzhou to study at university, but she had no idea where to go or how to get there. go. She told He Jingtao: &quot;The school admission brochure only said that you can take Line 6 to the Botanical Garden Station, and it didn&#39;t mention the distance before that at all. I took the train to Guangzhou Railway Station, and there will be no more.&quot; Next, Xiaojun asked How to get from the train station to the subway station, how to buy subway tickets, how to take the bus, etc. During the summer vacation, He Jingtao received a lot of similar requests for help. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many tourists traveling to Guangzhou face the problem that the place name of the destination is different from the name of the subway station. If they don’t know how to read navigation and don’t ask others for help online, they won’t know that to go to the famous scenic spot Shangxiajiu, they need to take Guangzhou Metro Line 6 and get off at the “Cultural Park” station; if they want to go to Beijing Road Pedestrian Street , you need to get off at &quot;Park Qian&quot; station. Aware of this, when He Jingtao was doing the &quot;subway tutorial&quot;, he mapped the common attractions he had compiled to each line, station and exit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ticket buying process is also a challenge. Xiao Wu, a self-media blogger, is from Baotou, Inner Mongolia. Only one city in Inner Mongolia, Hohhot, has access to subway. Once when he was on a business trip to Hohhot and taking the subway, he met a mother with her child who didn&#39;t know how to operate a ticket vending machine. There was a long queue behind her. She was also very anxious. &quot;The more anxious she was, the more mistakes she made.&quot; Xiao Wu bought the ticket for her. This little incident became the inspiration for choosing the topic. Xiao Wu made a similar short video &quot;Tutorial on taking the subway&quot;, using a first-person perspective with narration to show the whole process of taking the subway. The video wasn&#39;t complicated to create, but it gained unexpected attention, with many people saying it was &quot;very helpful.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiao Wu remembers that the first time he took the subway was when he was traveling to Beijing after graduating from high school and took the Beijing Subway Line 1. When he walked into the subway station, he was at a loss. He didn&#39;t know where to buy a ticket. There were many people in the station. He was embarrassed to stand by and learn how others operated, and he was embarrassed to ask passers-by who were in a hurry. Although I had made a guide online in advance, when I came to the subway station alone, I was still &quot;afraid of making mistakes and showing my cowardice&quot;, so I finally asked the staff for help. He realized that many people were going through similar situations and &quot;found there was a huge demand for this.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/yE7gJXewJ6pBDtDtFVhPCSJhntOn8EWVnmtyrhy3.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height= &quot;683&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/yE7gJXewJ6pBDtDtFVhPCSJhntOn8EWVnmtyrhy3.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254372&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;According to the official account of the Ministry of Transport, in September 2023, a total of 55 cities in mainland China had 299 urban rail transit lines in operation, completing a passenger volume of 2.49 billion. The picture shows passengers waiting for subway trains at Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport in July 2023. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;David also mentioned the issue of buying tickets. Among the requests for help he received, many people were wondering why the subway did not buy tickets first and then get on the bus like buses, high-speed rails, and airplanes. So when should the money be paid? Someone once asked him in a private message, &quot;If I need to transfer and buy a ticket at a self-service machine, can I buy the ticket directly to the terminal?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What are the biggest difficulties for help seekers? David thought about it for a long time, and his answer was &quot;They can&#39;t think of these problems.&quot; He also felt confused: he occasionally had trouble with troublesome questions such as directions, transfers, and finding the station, but he was rarely asked about it. Most people often just reported two place names and then asked how to get there. Many people also asked in the comment area: &quot;What software did you use for the route map?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Anyone who watches the video and asks questions really has friends from dozens of cities outside the subway. They. Those who have never sat in it just don’t know anything.&quot; David said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Improving social exclusion in transportation&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On social media, there are many bloggers like David and Xiao Wu who create life tutorial content and use short videos to teach people How to go to the cinema to watch a movie, stay in a hotel, send express delivery, etc. They are called &quot;social survival&quot; bloggers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the feedback they received, the most frequently mentioned word was &quot;social fear.&quot; Xiao Wu once received a private message from a girl, saying that she went to school alone in the city and her parents were working in other places. She felt a little anxious and depressed, and wanted to go to the hospital, but she had never been to a hospital alone, didn&#39;t know the process, and didn&#39;t dare to tell others, so she had to ask Xiao Wu for help. Later, Xiao Wu shot a video specifically for this purpose, &quot;How to See a Doctor in the Hospital for the First Time.&quot; Another girl said she suffered from severe depression and that her memory began to blur due to electroconvulsive therapy. Because she was afraid of being embarrassed in public, she began to be afraid to go out and stayed at home for two months. After watching Xiao Wu&#39;s video, she said: &quot;I think you not only warmed me, but also many friends who came out of the countryside for the first time and didn&#39;t know the various procedures.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let Xiao Wu The feedback that impressed me the most was &quot;Do you need to teach me about this?&quot; He was once troubled by this. After the video was posted, many people questioned him and said he was &quot;simplifying traffic&quot;: &quot;Why don&#39;t you teach me how to eat for the first time and how to eat for the first time?&quot; One drink of water?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Everyone thinks that young people should know a lot, but they don&#39;t know everything. Today&#39;s lifestyle is too complicated.&quot; Xiaojiang said. Her content is positioned as &quot;Guidelines for College Students&quot;, teaching newly independent college students various social survival skills. The most popular ones are tutorial videos on taking the subway, high-speed rail, and airplanes, which have hundreds of thousands of likes. Before going to college, Xiaojiang had never used taxi-hailing apps. Her parents would help her call a taxi. Her parents often asked her to go out to buy meat, but she couldn&#39;t tell the difference between various types of meat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Most college entrance examination candidates can only worry about studying.” David once received a private message from a mother saying that her child would fly from Tianjin to Chongqing to take the art exam and asked if he could help. Arranging transportation, because the situation was complicated, David added her WeChat for step-by-step guidance. The other party asked a lot of questions, ranging from whether I could catch up with the exam in the afternoon after landing in the morning, how much transportation time I had to reserve to rush to another city after the exam, and whether I could take paints and drawing boards with me on the plane or subway. She also asked a friend in Chongqing to take care of the entire transportation of her child. &quot;She arranged the whole process. Faced with such a complicated matter, I think this mother is quite methodical.&quot; David said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;She was very happy after she actually entered the pits, and I was also very happy.&quot; Ronaldinho said. Ronaldinho&#39;s mother likes to hear the &quot;beep&quot; sound when swiping the subway code when entering and exiting the station. She was very interested in everything in the subway. After leaving the station, her mother wanted to eat the grilled fish advertised on the subway. When she took the subway again in Chongqing, she was curious why the advertisement in the carriage changed to milk tea. As soon as she got out of the station, she wanted to eat. Ask Ronaldinho to take her to drink the milk tea in the subway advertisement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The whole trip turned into a subway trip. Once, because Ronaldinho had an appointment with a friend and needed to get off the subway in advance, he asked his mother, &quot;Can you take the subway back alone?&quot; Her mother calmly said no, &quot;no problem.&quot; During that journey, her mother took pictures of her every once in a while: &quot;Look, I still remember it.&quot; Later, Ronaldinho asked her if she got home smoothly. Her mother said that she had arrived home, and when she left the station, &quot;I really couldn&#39;t find it.&quot; She asked She asked the subway staff, who enthusiastically pointed her to the exit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Completing the task of leaving the station alone gave her mother a great confidence. She said: &quot;It turns out that taking the subway is so easy.&quot; After returning home, she showed off to her father that she took the subway today and wanted to go there in the future. When going shopping on Chunxi Road in Chengdu, her father does not need to drive her. She can take the subway by herself. Dad said, let Ronaldinho teach him too. After learning how to ride the subway, her mother recorded all the procedures that Ronaldinho taught her on her mobile phone, and even took her colleagues with her when she went shopping. Her colleagues praised her, &quot;We can&#39;t even play with these things, but you can play so smoothly.&quot; My mother was very impressed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When returning from the trip, her mother asked Ronaldinho to teach her how to use 12306 to buy high-speed rail tickets. Ronaldinho sent her a high-speed rail instruction video. Later, my mother bought a high-speed rail ticket and went to Xi&#39;an to visit her old classmates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a tourism practitioner, He Jingtao can understand the importance of transportation issues. &quot;Tourism consists of five aspects: food, accommodation, travel, shopping, and entertainment, and transportation is one of them.&quot; But he admitted that he was surprised after his first subway riding tutorial became popular. “I didn’t know so many people needed it before I made it.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Professor Wang Shijun of Tongji University pointed out that in the context of rapid urbanization, some groups in urban transportation should receive more attention, that is, those with poor mobility in space and the inability to travel freely and conveniently. Destination groups, such as low-income groups, urban migrants, disabled people, elderly people who cannot use smartphones, etc. The lack of mobility in urban transportation not only leads to social differentiation and the formation of marginalized circles, but also affects all levels of social participation such as employment, schooling, and health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the possible consequences of this unfair situation is the social exclusion of transport disadvantaged groups. Professor Wang Shijun believes that the main factor leading to social exclusion in my country&#39;s urban transportation is that the current urban transportation is still in the stage of pursuing efficiency and maximizing traffic capacity, and less consideration is given to social equity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1965, China&#39;s first underground railway, Beijing Subway Line 1, started construction. It took more than ten years from preparation to opening. In the 20th century, only four cities in mainland China, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Guangzhou, had urban rail transit lines. Entering the 21st century, opening up to the outside world and economic development have driven a boom in subway construction, because building subways can promote the flow of population resources and optimize land allocation. There is a popular slogan among the people: &quot;When the subway rings, there is a thousand taels of gold.&quot; From 2010 to 2020, China&#39;s urban rail transit construction has been booming for ten years. During these ten years, 29 cities across the country have opened subways. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, the subway has become an indispensable part of the daily life of many urban residents in China. Rail transit operation data for September 2023 released by the Ministry of Transport shows that 55 cities in mainland China have opened urban rail transit lines, and the subway mileage ranks first in the world. The total passenger volume in 2022 will be approximately 22.42 billion. In the new round of subway construction applications that will be launched in July 2023, more than 30 cities may apply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Shijun believes that various official and private tutorials equipped with new media media are social innovation measures and are conducive to improving social exclusion in transportation, because an important aspect of transportation exclusion is the inability to obtain high-quality Transportation and travel information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this stage, the guidance services provided by the subway mainly rely on platform services and volunteers. Professor Huang Xiaoyan from the Northwest Land and Resources Research Center of Shaanxi Normal University also pointed out that the form of content, the platform on which it is released, and the target group are all important. Many transportation disadvantaged groups are limited by their own human capital and do not have access to this information. &quot;Now it may be necessary to consider both macro and meso levels, as well as from the perspective of inclusiveness, fairness, and refined governance, in order to do this matter better.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhou Heng recently I passed the campus recruitment interview and am preparing to do an internship in the subway system at the end of the year. He felt that it was a pity that the professional internship that was supposed to be completed in his freshman and sophomore years was delayed by the epidemic and did not start until close to graduation. Therefore, he did not know much about his future job. He only roughly knew that he needed to maintain platform order, pick up and depart trains, and serve passengers. . If he passes the internship assessment, he will become an official subway station attendant. He found that many people &quot;didn&#39;t seem to understand and didn&#39;t ask&quot; at the subway station. &quot;When you go in (you should) look for the staff first.

It is common for local administrative departments to not list football as a special reform task. Inner Mongolia’s recognition of the value of football education and culture is not high enough. There is a general situation of insufficient attention to the development of football culture and ineffective measures. The industry development goals and the expectations of fans and society cannot resonate at the same frequency, and the continued deepening of football reform is restricted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such situations also exist in many places in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;——The construction of local football associations is weak&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An official of a provincial football association believes that he hopes that the Chinese Football Association will do more to reform the local football associations. Effective support. At present, football associations at all levels are top-heavy, with smaller living spaces as they go down, and they lack hematopoietic ability. Most of the city and county-level football associations have no entity and only have a brand name, making it difficult or even impossible to carry out their work. Football has a strong urban attribute. Some city football associations are strong but provincial football associations are weak. The latter&#39;s position is awkward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Junqing said that the reform of some local football management systems is struggling. Some grassroots football associations and football organizations generally face problems such as insufficient market development resources, insufficient comprehensive coordination, unstable income sources, and lack of professional talents; many grassroots football associations and football organizations generally face problems such as insufficient market development resources, insufficient comprehensive coordination, unstable income sources, and lack of professional talents. The Football Association has not formed a fixed model in terms of its own construction, work operations, and guarantee mechanisms, and is generally less enthusiastic and proactive; grassroots football development is mostly initiated by passionate football enthusiasts; administrative department support is weak; as a social organization, the Football Association is recognized The degree is generally low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;——The development of the professional league has encountered a bottleneck&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An investor in a professional club said that if the league does not develop well, the national team will Rootless water; at present, clubs generally lack blood-forming ability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, many clubs still have serious problems with wage arrears and historical debts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Pei, a professor at the School of Sports Science at South China Normal University, said that many football clubs have become platforms for the exchange of public resources (mainly land). When public resources cannot be obtained through clubs, some parent companies decisively get rid of this burden. This is also the main reason why dozens of football clubs have disbanded or withdrawn in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Affected by &quot;Jinyuan Football&quot; and the transfer market has been dominated by several brokerage companies and individuals for a long time, player prices have been artificially high for a long time. The various systems for football agents, including registration, are not perfect enough, which to a certain extent contributes to the &quot;false fire&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;——The utility of youth football still exists&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Junqing believes that young players are “prematurely specialized” and training goals Problems such as &quot;one-dimensionality&quot;, &quot;adultization&quot; of training and management models, and emphasis on competition and neglect of techniques and tactics still exist; &quot;championshipism&quot; still dominates youth competitions, leading to the contradiction between &quot;leaders want results and organizations want talents.&quot; There are occurrences; the integration of sports and education is insufficient, and the connection between campus football and professional youth training systems is not smooth; most clubs do not have a complete youth training echelon, and there are gaps in football talent training; there is a large gap in grassroots football talent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Allen Renard, director of youth training at Allen Football Academy, talked about three issues: First, the phenomenon of youth training clubs poaching from each other is rampant, and some even poach people across the country, which damages the players’ enlightenment. Club Benefits. Second, most of the competitions organized by football associations at all levels are tournament-based, and there is a lack of high-quality competitions. Third, there are few venues suitable for social youth training clubs, the procedures for building new venues are cumbersome, and the operating costs are high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An investor in a professional club said that the youth calendar is confusing and repetitive, disrupting children’s training, learning, and life rhythms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the youth training compensation mechanism and joint mechanism compensation are not implemented well, which damages the interests of youth training institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Pei said that going to college is the ultimate goal of many football teenagers. They achieve this goal by obtaining a grade certificate, but their football careers often end after obtaining the certificate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deng Shijun, a physical education teacher at Wansongyuan Road Primary School in Wuhan City, said that there is a youth league at the national level, but the grassroots competition system still needs to be improved; children who play football cannot keep up with their cultural studies, and children who study have no time. To play football, it is urgent to improve the talent training system; due to the lack of a coaching training system, although many students from normal sports departments participate in campus football promotion after graduation, they do not have the qualifications of football coaches, and their knowledge structure cannot meet the needs of campus football development; due to the lack of fixed In competitions, referees generally lack a training platform and have low standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/ec24a71b0a92685fcda5da59eaf1f969.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/ec24a71b0a92685fcda5da59eaf1f969.png&quot; data-key=&quot;254227&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;This is July 10, 2022, in the first China Youth Football League (Zhejiang Division) Boys’ Primary School U11 Group Competition , Yang Haoyuan (second from right), a young player from Hangzhou Pujia Primary School, and Zhao Yirui (first from right), a young player from Zhejiang Ostrich Football Club, fight for the ball.

They often only recognize the honor value brought by it in international competitions and lack sufficient understanding of its overall value. There is insufficient understanding of the long-term, systematic and arduous nature of football, resulting in some short-sighted behaviors. Competitive performance is actually the objective result of football developing to a certain stage. Through the educational function of football, people&#39;s all-round development can be improved. Young people&#39;s participation in football should not be for the purpose of assessing grades and gaining points for higher education, but to enjoy fun and achieve the purpose of cultivating people through happy education. Only with correct values ​​can we build correct rule systems and other systems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;——The Chinese Football Association has established a good system&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jia Leishi, executive member of the Guangxi Football Association, said that the Chinese Football Association should clarify its own Our positioning is to provide good football services and do basic work, such as improving the league, youth training, coaching, refereeing and other systems. For example, he said that although there are now Chinese Super League, Chinese League One, Chinese League Two, Chinese Champions League and other leagues, the provincial, city and county league system is not perfect. Football powers have as many as a dozen or even dozens of leagues, which form the basis for sustainable development. ; At the same time, the Chinese Football Association should be more down-to-earth, establish a working system with the Football Associations at all levels, and have good business connections; the Football Association&#39;s departmental settings should be scientific; decentralize power and better play the role of the executive committee and member associations; Football Association affairs at all levels It should be transparent and open. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/7580afae56cc4e3400db8366b860feec.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/7580afae56cc4e3400db8366b860feec.png&quot; data-key=&quot;254226&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;On July 7, Tianjin Jinmen Tigers fans cheered for the team. Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter Sun Fanyue&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for how to connect the Chinese Champions League with the amateur league, Huang Shenghua, chairman of Shaanxi Changan United Football Club, said that a &quot;double pyramid&quot; that is independent of each other but connected in an orderly manner can be considered system, that is, professional leagues, semi-professional leagues, and amateur leagues each construct independent league pyramid systems, and the two systems are connected through event results and access regulations. On the one hand, the &quot;double pyramid&quot; system gives cities, clubs, investors, and players interested in the development of professional football an upward path; on the other hand, amateur leagues with independent &quot;pyramid&quot; systems pass competition rules, team review, etc. Prevent too many professional, semi-professional players and professional club-related teams from sinking into the amateur league, prevent too many teams from investing huge sums in order to be promoted to the Chinese Champions League, and avoid affecting the enthusiasm of ordinary football fans to participate in the amateur league. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;——Improving the construction of national teams at all levels&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Professionals said that the selection mechanism of team members should be improved to select players to serve the country Excellent players with strong aspirations, first-class will and quality, good ability and style, and reasonable age structure will enter the national team; build the national team talent pool and strengthen the scientific selection; unify the technical and tactical play styles of the national teams at all levels; establish a training monitoring and evaluation system to achieve National team members at all levels train in clubs and conduct daily monitoring and evaluation of competition data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;——Increase high-quality youth competitions&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deng Shijun said that the construction of grassroots competition systems such as city and district levels should be strengthened. For example, the &quot;Wan Chao League&quot; in Jianghan District, Wuhan City runs throughout the school year and has become a platform for the growth of young players. Through school district integration, Wansongyuan Road Primary School will share its space and teachers with other primary schools in the district. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He also suggested exploring a training model in which students from physical education departments in normal colleges and universities obtain coaching qualifications (grassroots, D, C and even B levels) during college, which will partially solve the problem of campus football teachers; vigorously train students referee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reynard suggested that football associations at all levels introduce a third-party event operation system, encourage regional youth events to be graded and held continuously throughout the year, and provide venue policies and financial support for social forces to participate in youth training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of youth training compensation, professionals suggest that when conditions are ripe, a third-party account can be set up and relevant rules can be established. Transfers can only be made after completing the corresponding training compensation and joint mechanism compensation, so as to improve youth training. Institutional enthusiasm. At this stage, supervision is being strengthened and clubs that default on youth training compensation payments will be punished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;——Improve the mechanism for the integration of sports and education&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the integration of sports and education, Li Pei suggested: First, clarify the sports and education department responsibilities and rights. The education department is responsible for popularizing youth football in the compulsory education stage, and the sports department is responsible for further improving competitive levels. The second is to establish a supervision and evaluation mechanism. The education department needs to improve the evaluation indicator system for various campus football projects, strengthen the construction of internal supervision and evaluation mechanisms, strengthen the audit and performance evaluation of special funds, allocate resources based on the evaluation results, and supervise and rectify or disqualify units that fail the evaluation. The Chinese Football Association has the power to assess the levels of referees, coaches and players. It must not only strengthen internal supervision and evaluation, but also introduce a third-party supervision and evaluation mechanism. The sports department should establish a database of youth coaches, referees and team members, conduct supervision and evaluation based on competition performance, and serve as the basis for talent selection and promotion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;——Anti-corruption should be institutionalized&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the corruption phenomenon in Chinese football, Zhou Ming, a partner at Beijing Weiheng Law Firm, said , the decision-making mechanism of the Chinese Football Association must be more transparent, and at the same time introduce an external supervision and restriction mechanism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Zhenghang, a lawyer at Jingsh Law Firm, suggested strengthening the prevention mechanism before the incident and the rapid rectification mechanism after the incident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said that it is recommended that each club establish an internal supervision system. From a legal perspective, it is an anti-fraud mechanism in corporate compliance construction. Fraud here mainly refers to counterfeit gambling matters. The system construction includes the club&#39;s internal reporting mechanism, internal review mechanism and post-verification handling and reporting mechanism. It is also recommended that the Chinese Football Association establish a match-fixing supervision and inspection mechanism to conduct independent investigations and accountability for incidents that may be suspected of match-fixing discovered during complaints and reports or through arbitration committees, disciplinary committee hearings, penalties, etc., and to cooperate with the internal supervision of the above-mentioned clubs. The system is connected, and suspected crimes are directly transferred to the relevant investigation departments for further processing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people in the legal profession said that the Chinese Football Association should establish a normalized cooperation mechanism with the Ministry of Public Security. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The chairman of the Football Association of a southern province said that football reform should be carried out unswervingly and in accordance with the overall direction, requirements and path proposed by the football reform plan. If it can be solidly advanced and all departments can coordinate well, how can we What if I can’t do it well? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 12:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[成都2岁女童遭恶犬咬伤]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258847]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 11:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;A 2-year-old girl in Chongzhou, Chengdu was attacked by a vicious dog.

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;据弥勒市安全生产委员会办公室在事发后发布的通知，坠落的电梯是佛城商都一期的1号电梯。当天18时许，微信公众号“弥勒发布”公布信息，电梯从四楼掉到一楼，有人受伤。目前事件的发生原因正在调查。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;当地一位经常前往佛城商都的居民王宁（化名）告诉南方周末记者，事发之时，佛城商都和周边正值每周三农村的赶集日，人流密集。即便平日，这家总共四层楼的商贸城也有近千户商家，“进进出出每天上万人”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;至于坠落的电梯，虽然在严格意义上被划分为货梯，平时却是“人、货、三轮车混装”的。王宁表示，电梯平时就非常拥挤，“过节直接人挤人，安全隐患太大了”。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;客货混装，老年人常乘坐&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;18日上午11时50分左右，前来弥勒做生意的梁平（化名）正在佛城商都四楼吃饭，突然听见一声巨响，“所有人就围过去了”。他告诉南方周末记者，当时在心里猜测电梯是不是出事了，后来“过去一问，确实是出事了，掉到一楼去了”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;大约20分钟后，救护车来到佛城商都。梁平看到两个被抬出来的老年人，“一个少数民族的阿姨，大概也有七十来岁了吧，已经不省人事了，后来又抬出来一个，也穿着少数民族的衣服，戴着帽子一样的头饰。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;梁平说，他自己去过三次佛城商都，据他观察，出事的货梯有十多平米，“电动三轮车都可以开进去”。电梯客货混装，“当地人平时都会坐，因为客梯用不过来”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;他介绍，商城的一楼是菜市，卖菜、肉、水果；二楼卖调料、香料、干货；三楼卖衣服；四楼是最高层，又是一个菜市，卖的东西比较杂，“就像农贸市场一样”。多位受访者反映，平时到这里买菜的主要是当地人，其中老年人大多坐电梯上楼。“（老人）上四楼也挺费劲的，一般都是坐电梯，直接爬楼梯的少之又少”，梁平说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;另一位当地人李成（化名）向南方周末记者描述，商场南、北都有可以搭载三轮车的大货梯，出事的电梯位于商城北门。此外，商场里还有两部扶梯。平时除了拉货卖菜的商贩，也有买菜的居民会乘坐货梯，此外货梯内还有专职人员管理楼层按钮。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;弥勒吉盛商业管理有限公司官网显示，佛城商都商业综合体的前身，是弥勒老鸿丰农贸市场，综合体在农贸市场的原址上升级改造而成；建筑面积共计6.4万平方米，共有商铺八百多间，固定、零散摊位六百多个。事发地的农贸市场位于佛城商都一期，四层楼层之间由楼梯、电动扶&amp;nbsp;梯相连。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;梁平回忆，电梯出事前，他曾到三楼上厕所，听到楼梯附近传出滴滴的警报声。据他分析，楼梯距离出事的货梯只有几米远，这个警报声“不知道是不是和电梯有联系”。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;涉事品牌遭多地行政处罚&lt;/h2>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;李成记得，此前去佛城商都买东西时，隔几天就能看见商场维护电梯。他表示，出于安全考虑，并不会乘坐货梯，只会乘坐扶梯。王宁印象中，这部出事的电梯平时就有一些小问题，有时去卖货，就看见这部电梯没有开放。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;18日21时许，南方周末记者拨打佛城商都监控室工作人员的联系电话，对方确认，市场中的电梯厂商为上海爱登堡电梯集团股份有限公司（以下简称爱登堡电梯），但出事的电梯型号未知。该工作人员表示，“电梯从佛城商都建起来就开始用了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;公开信息显示，佛城商都第一期于2015年开业，物业运营方为弥勒吉盛商业管理有限公司。事故发生后，南方周末记者拨打了该公司和其母公司云南吉成控股有限公司相关负责人的电话，均被挂断。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;南方周末记者拨打了爱登堡电梯、爱登堡云南分公司和昆明分公司的电话，均无人接听。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;爱登堡电梯曾多次出现维保不善的记录。资料显示，2018年，昆明市质监局曾接到投诉举报，昆明市龙江西路融城昆明湖小区5栋3号梯发生电梯困人事故，爱登堡电梯为该电梯维保单位。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;企查查显示，近年来，爱登堡电梯多次因“未按照安全技术规范要求保养电梯”，被成都、莆田、安庆、济南等多地市场监管部门处罚。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;爱登堡电梯最近一次的行政处罚记录在2023年3月。成都市双流区市场监管局抽查发现，某小区电梯的纸质版维修记录中，爱登堡品牌电梯第一次和最后一次维保时间分别为2022年5月和2022年9月。其工作人员表示，后期维保记录都通过手机APP登记，但APP显示，该电梯仅在2023年1月有过一次维保记录。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023年1月，昆明市呈贡区市场监管局同样以“未按照安全技术规范要求进行电梯维护保养”，处罚了爱登堡电梯的云南分公司，罚金1万元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;《中华人民共和国特种设备安全法》规定，电梯作为一种对人身和财产安全有较大危险性的特种设备，其运营使用单位应对设备的使用安全负责，设置安全管理机构或者配备专职的安全管理人员。作业人员发现事故隐患或者其他不安全因素时，应立即向安全管理人员和单位有关负责人报告；当特种设备运行不正常时，作业人员应按照操作规程，采取有效措施保证安全。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;而根据《电梯维护保养规则》，维保单位应制定应急措施和救援预案，每半年至少针对本单位不同类别的电梯进行一次应急演练。维保过程若发现事故隐患，要及时告知电梯使用单位，若发现严重事故隐患，还要及时向当地的特种设备安全监管部门报告。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[新来的领导要“立威”？当以能力与公道服人]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258690]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;How to establish prestige when you have just been promoted to a leader? One netizen said that this can be divided into three situations. First, the most ideal situation: your appointment is a typical internal promotion. Everyone thinks you are the best candidate to be the leader of the department, so it doesn’t matter whether you establish prestige or not. At this time, you only need to do what a leader should do and let everyone recognize your management methods and abilities. Second, a more difficult situation: because you have been transferred from another department, the employees in your department are still relatively unfamiliar with you. In this situation, you should not first think about how to establish prestige. Instead, you should act as a new member of the department and adopt the concept of learning to adapt to and learn from the situation of this department. Once you have figured it out, you can then think about the next step. matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most difficult situation is the third situation: your appointment has aroused opposition from many people in the department, and many people feel that you are not worthy of being the leader. At this time, if you don’t have strong abilities, it’s better not to think about the self-defeating tactics of Zhaoliwei. You should focus on maintaining the situation first, and then look for opportunities to find ways to break through the resistance that affects you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above classification is still very reasonable, and my experience can also confirm it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Years ago, when I took the position of director of an important department at my former employer and became the leader of many old colleagues, I also thought about this issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I first came to this unit, I was still a trainee. Most of my colleagues who later became &quot;subordinates&quot; of my department are already senior employees. After I was promoted to a full-time position in advance and was promoted in advance, I felt tremendous pressure. I was afraid that my colleagues in the department would not listen to me, which would cause great embarrassment. As a person who has worked in the military camp for twelve years and &quot;managed people&quot;, I understand that the environment I am in is different. I don&#39;t think I have the temperament of a &quot;tyrannical CEO&quot; at all, so I choose the most clumsy and dull kind. For example, I lead everyone to work together, occasionally share tasks for colleagues and then give them &quot;work points&quot;, and I also create things in my spare time. On the condition that they are invited to eat and play, and they try their best to help colleagues in need. Strive to win favor with a &quot;passionate leadership&quot; attitude. This approach is very different from that of &quot;smart people&quot; who are good at playing tricks and talking around. I used to think that what I did was a sign of lack of &quot;leadership&quot;, but now that I think about it, what I did was actually not bad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I doubt whether a leader like me belongs to the &quot;minority&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Needless to say, there is an unknown dream of &quot;tree power&quot; hidden deep in our souls. Wang Xifeng in the Grand View Garden also wanted to establish his authority and used various tricks for this purpose. For many people, the hardest thing to resist is the urge to show off their status in front of others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As I get older, I can better understand the frivolousness of being eager to declare authority when I &quot;reached the top&quot; of the department when I was young. Over the years, I have seen several newly promoted young cadres being &quot;verbally bribed&quot; by frequently calling them &quot;Director X&quot; and &quot;General Manager X&quot;, with visible pride on their faces. There are countless workplace dramas in which, in the eagerness to establish prestige and eliminate &quot;thornheads&quot;, they get into a big fight with their subordinates and find it difficult to deal with the situation. The shortcomings are still due to the lack of knowledge in the heart, and they actually act willfully regardless of their actual situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Considering the circumstances mentioned by the respondent, if everyone is convinced by you, is there any need to show your authority? If everyone is &quot;not cold&quot; towards you, is there any point in showing off your prestige? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What&#39;s more, what some people call &quot;establishing authority&quot; is to use power to suppress others and use &quot;authority&quot; to the extreme. Otherwise, they will feel that their rights do not expire and become invalid. In the workplace, this disease is not as common as Other areas are lighter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A good friend of mine said it well, letting someone be a leader means letting you take the lead in doing things, not letting you deal with others. However, some people who hold leadership positions with dishonorable reputations or unworthy morals care about their &quot;tails&quot; being discovered and stepped on by their subordinates. Therefore, they either play the trick of killing chickens to scare monkeys, or they show off their power. In the attitude of &quot;You have to be afraid of me&quot; and &quot;It&#39;s better to kneel down and lick me&quot;. This is not to establish authority, it is simply to establish enemies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, if some people insist on &quot;controlling others&quot; in the workplace, they will often hit a wall. Even if I can&#39;t survive your actions, isn&#39;t it okay to change departments and leave? How many people&#39;s resentment and disdain are hidden in the narrative here between the iron-clad &quot;workplace&quot; and the smooth &quot;beating workers&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, it is not a bad thing for a person to have prestige, or to want to establish prestige. However, it is open to speculation as to where a person&#39;s prestige should come from - whether it comes from power and the means designed to display power, or from character and ability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, no matter what circumstances you become a leader, whether you are inside or outside the system, you cannot do without this question: Is your judgment better than that of your subordinates? , whether what you do is more beautiful than what your subordinates do. In the final analysis, as a leader, whether you have authority or not is determined by your professional ability and character. When you are well-equipped with both political integrity and talent, and do things well, even if you are an &quot;airborne soldier&quot; or a rising star, you will still be respected by your subordinates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Specifically, when faced with hesitation, it is inevitable to make decisions with leadership authority and let subordinates follow the arrangements. However, in a normal context, leaders must not only be good at forming consensus with subordinates, but also be good at forming consensus with subordinates. Have the awareness and courage to advance and retreat together, and must defend the legitimate rights and interests of subordinates at all times. As an old friend said, a leader cannot protect his subordinates from wind and rain. What do you want the leader to do? Is it just a decoration? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than ten years ago, when my &quot;power&quot; was at its greatest, the department consisted of three or four departments, with dozens of employees, and the management situation was quite complicated. I don’t know if I have built up any prestige during my years as a department leader, but after I left my job, I overheard praise from my old colleagues: I dared to take on tasks for my subordinates. In addition, some colleagues also said to me, &quot;You have resigned, so why are we still here?&quot; and they finally left after me. I am often inexplicably moved by these sincere words and true nature, and feel that I am worth it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In reality, it is not uncommon for leaders to have great ambitions but little talent, and for laymen to lead experts, and such leaders are particularly indifferent to the rights and feelings of their subordinates. They either give credit to themselves and pass the blame to their subordinates, squeeze and intimidate them in various ways, and simply treat their subordinates like fools, or they are alienated from their subordinates, suspicious of each other, and have no integrity. For this kind of leader, even if no one dares to say &quot;no&quot; to his face, he will inevitably be scolded behind his back. It should be noted that no one in this world is a fool. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, a leader should look like a leader: have good judgment and strong ability to act, be able to make decisions, take responsibility, and have a simple and strong character. Even if such a leader&#39;s ability needs to be strengthened, he can still improve his overall performance and gain the understanding and support of his subordinates. Can a leader who is magnanimous and fair in his actions have a bad reputation? I have lived over fifty years and have never seen an example to the contrary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（本文仅为作者个人观点，不代表本报立场）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[五年间，千亿债务“削峰”：地方化债的镇江样本]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258822]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/NTydygQiWy1Aa7n58WpDWSaGYxFYkXRNWBLwCKW4.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1800&quot; height=&quot;1201&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/NTydygQiWy1Aa7n58WpDWSaGYxFY kXRNWBLwCKW4. png&quot; data-key=&quot;254417&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the past few decades, Zhenjiang’s economy has mainly relied on heavy industries such as chemicals. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This year, the feeling is very obvious. Mainstream financial institutions have begun to do business in Zhenjiang.” A financial leasing company An employee told Southern Weekend reporters that due to risk control reasons, the company had not done business in Zhenjiang for several years, but this year it allowed it to do so. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2013, the scale of Zhenjiang’s debt has continued to rise, and it was even once called the “four major Internet celebrities” in the market’s urban investment debt issues, together with Zunyi, Xiangtan, and Dalian. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Enterprise Early Warning Data, if the debt ratio is calculated as (government debt + urban investment platform interest-bearing debt)/GDP, Zhenjiang’s debt ratio has increased from 105% in 2018 to 121% in 2020 . In the past three years, its debt ratio has been higher than that of the other 12 prefecture-level cities in Jiangsu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The high debt ratio has increased financial pressure in Zhenjiang, and financial institutions have also been deterred, and most have chosen to reduce their business volume in Zhenjiang. However, in 2023, Zhenjiang’s local debt situation showed obvious signs of improvement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An obvious signal is that two urban investment companies in Zhenjiang have just received AAA entity ratings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 13, 2023, the official website of the Jiangsu Provincial State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission issued a document stating that Zhenjiang Industrial Investment Holding Group Co., Ltd. and Zhenjiang Urban Investment Holding Group Co., Ltd. have both obtained AAA subject credit ratings, realizing the credit construction of Zhenjiang City. A historic breakthrough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, the highest credit rating of Zhenjiang’s urban investment companies was AA+. Among the 13 prefecture-level cities in Jiangsu Province, Lianyungang, Suqian and Zhenjiang have no urban investment companies with AAA credit ratings. Obtaining an AAA rating means that the financing difficulty of the urban investment platform is reduced and the cost is reduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“After the debt situation eased this year, our bank reopened the credit line to a city investment platform in Zhenjiang.” A person who works at a city commercial bank in Jiangsu revealed to Southern Weekend reporters that the city investment company had previously Risk point: His bank had suspended credit to the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, among the 13 prefecture-level cities in Jiangsu Province, Zhenjiang’s GDP ranked fourth from the bottom. Although it is located in southern Jiangsu, its economy is far away from Wuxi, Changzhou and Suzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How did Zhenjiang, a relatively weak economy, resolve hundreds of billions of debts? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“There are more difficulties than expected, and the challenges are greater than expected”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Zhenjiang is located at the intersection of the Yangtze River and the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, guarding the north-south hub, and is connected with Nanjing, Changzhou, Taizhou and Yangzhou border on each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Jiangsu Statistical Yearbook and the seventh national census data, Zhenjiang covers the smallest area among the 13 prefecture-level cities. Among the population distribution across Jiangsu Province, only Zhenjiang has a permanent population of less than 4 million. In other words, Zhenjiang has the least land and the least people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1983, Zhenjiang became a provincial municipality. In the past few decades, Zhenjiang&#39;s economy has mainly relied on heavy industries such as chemicals. According to the Zhenjiang Municipal Economic and Social Development Bulletin, from 2013 to 2017, the total output value of Zhenjiang heavy industry accounted for more than 80% of the total output value of designated industries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2016, in order to protect the ecological environment, Jiangsu Province began to deploy special actions to reduce backward chemical production capacity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the official website of the Zhenjiang Municipal Government, in 2017, the city shut down a total of 53 chemical companies, exceeding the provincial target (6 companies). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“For backward and excess production capacity, we must resolutely eliminate those that should be eliminated.” In January 2019, Bu Xiaofang, then director of Zhenjiang Municipal Economic and Information Technology Commission, introduced that in 2018, the city shut down 44 chemical companies, a total of 44 chemical companies were shut down in the past two years. Nearly half of chemical companies have been shut down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under environmental protection regulations, Zhenjiang’s economy has entered a period of pain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, its annual fixed asset investment fell by 26.5% compared with the previous year, and private investment fell by 30.4%. In terms of industries, investment in the secondary industry dropped by 28.9%, of which industrial investment dropped by 27.9%; investment in the tertiary industry dropped by 24.3%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also this year, Zhenjiang’s GDP growth rate was 3%, ranking last among the 13 prefecture-level cities. Its GDP growth rate was 9.3% in 2016 and 7.24% in 2017. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 2019 Government Work Report introduced that in the past year, the three indicators of Zhenjiang’s GDP, total retail sales of consumer goods, and fixed asset investment have failed to meet the goals set by the People’s Congress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The then mayor of Zhenjiang City, Zhang Yefei, said in his government work report, &quot;Looking back on 2018, there were more difficulties and greater challenges than expected.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people in northern Jiangsu In cities, chemical industry is also an important industry, so why does it have less impact on economic growth than Zhenjiang? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An economist in Zhenjiang told Southern Weekend reporters that unlike the northern Jiangsu region, the Yangtze River flows through Zhenjiang. In the past, many chemical companies were located in areas closer to the Yangtze River. In the past few years, the Yangtze River Under the Great Protection Strategy, environmental protection management has become more stringent, and many chemical companies have had to close down or move away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The upgrading of industrial structure requires a buffer period.” The scholar analyzed that compared with other cities in southern Jiangsu, Zhenjiang’s high-tech enterprises and advanced manufacturing enterprises are small in scale and lack core leading enterprises, which will lead to local The capacity for economic development is limited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, after the new leadership team of the Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government took office, Zhenjiang’s development philosophy also changed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Zhenjiang will never repeat extensive growth in pursuit of speed, never engage in ‘numbers games’ in pursuit of political achievements, will never borrow blindly for image projects, and will never sacrifice the ecological environment in pursuit of economic interests. .&quot; In January 2019, Zhang Yefei, then mayor of Zhenjiang City, said in an interview. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While the chemical industry was shut down and reorganized, a large amount of debt burdened by the vigorous development of urban construction in previous years was still accumulating, which put pressure on Zhenjiang&#39;s finances of low revenue and high debt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2017, the Zhenjiang Municipal Government’s work report stated, “In the past five years, the urban area has completed a total of 290 billion yuan in urban construction investment.” In comparison, Zhenjiang’s general public budget revenue in 2017 was 28.4 billion yuan. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During this period, urban investment debt also increased rapidly. According to the Enterprise Alert, from 2013 to 2017, the interest-bearing debt of Zhenjiang Urban Investment Platform increased from 122.1 billion yuan to 350.3 billion yuan, an increase of 187%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee inspection team inspected the Zhenjiang Municipal Party Committee and found that during a certain period, &quot;the municipal Party committee did not do enough research on debt control, economic layout, major projects, and urban construction.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Zhenjiang Municipal Party Committee wrote in the inspection and rectification report that in view of the inadequate management of government investment projects, it was made clear that all government investment projects must be managed by the municipal party committee and municipal government through unified decision-making, and a series of documents were issued to build a System system for completion acceptance. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Municipal finance has completely returned to &#39;food finance&#39;&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Economic growth has slowed down, a large amount of money has been invested in urban construction, and there is rigid payment pressure on the finance. Zhenjiang&#39;s local debt problem has gradually exposed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2018, Zhenjiang City’s budget implementation in the first half of the year revealed that the scale of municipal fiscal maintenance and operation expenditures has increased year by year. In 2018, the municipal department budget arrangements for personnel, operations and business project expenditures were close to 3.4 billion yuan. &quot;Under the development trend of large total operating expenditure, high proportion, and rapid growth, municipal finance has completely returned to &#39;food finance&#39;.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Food finance&quot; refers to the fiscal revenue of the first-level government, which is only enough to maintain the salaries of personnel in government agencies and institutions, as well as basic daily operations. In 2018, Zhenjiang City’s general public budget revenue was 12.6 billion yuan. 3.4 billion yuan, equivalent to 27% of the general public budget revenue that year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhenjiang’s 2018 budget execution report stated that incremental financial resources are limited, and the balance of fiscal revenue and expenditure in recent years has mainly relied on revitalizing existing stocks, coordinating funds, and replacing financial resources. However, there is less and less room to absorb incremental expenditure through existing financial resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China Discipline Inspection and Supervision News reported that on January 18, 2019, Lou Qinjian, then Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, pointed out that “Zhenjiang City has weak links in supervision of key areas, and the government’s hidden debt risks are prominent. , and there are even corruption issues.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Slowly, Zhenjiang’s debt situation became known to the outside world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Zhenjiang, debts are mainly concentrated in various urban investment platforms, and government debt is still controlled under the limit. If you look at the debt scale of Zhenjiang Urban Investment alone, it is much lower than that of Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou and other places, and is not outstanding in Jiangsu Province. The key issue is the debt ratio. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhenjiang’s debt ratio is much higher than that of other cities in Jiangsu. According to the aforementioned calculation method, in 2013, its debt ratio was only 41.71%, and in 2020 it reached 121%. If the debt ratio is too high, it means that the local comprehensive financial resources are difficult to repay debts, and cannot even guarantee the existence of debts, which is prone to risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the urban investment debts in Guizhou, Yunnan and other places are concentrated at the county level. But in Zhenjiang, urban investment debts are mainly concentrated in municipal platforms. The enterprise warning notice shows that in 2022, the interest-bearing debt of Zhenjiang&#39;s top four municipal urban investment platforms will be 207.5 billion yuan, and the interest-bearing debt of all urban investment platforms in Zhenjiang will be 340.5 billion yuan, accounting for 61%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This situation is also related to Zhenjiang’s economic structure. Zhenjiang has jurisdiction over 3 districts and 3 county-level cities. The economic aggregate of county-level cities is higher than that of municipal districts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“In the past few years, Zhenjiang City has not been as prosperous as the counties (county-level cities) below. Mainstream financial institutions would rather do business in the counties (county-level cities) than invest in the cities. Platform operation.&quot; Wang Li, who works for a financial leasing company in Shanghai, and whose major customers are mainly urban investment companies across Jiangsu, explained to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to alleviate financing pressure, Zhenjiang Urban Investment Platform began to issue a large number of non-standard products. Compared with bank loans and bonds, non-standard financing issuance costs are higher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhenjiang Cultural Tourism Industry Group (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Zhenjiang Cultural Tourism&quot;) is 100% owned by the Zhenjiang Municipal State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission and is a municipal urban investment platform. Zhenjiang Cultural Tourism&#39;s bond prospectus shows that in 2017, its non-standard financing scale was only 2.8 billion yuan, and by 2020, it had climbed to 11.8 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past ten years, Zhang Huan has spent tens of millions of yuan purchasing non-standard products from urban investment companies in various places. He told Southern Weekend reporters that around 2016, he purchased non-standard products in Zhenjiang, and the interest rate was less than 7%. However, at that time, the income from urban investment bonds in Guizhou, Yunnan and other places was higher, and non-standard products in Zhenjiang were not easy to sell. &quot; In order to persuade me to buy, the agent would give me some rebates, such as buying 1 million and getting 10,000 back.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An employee of a financing intermediary company told Southern Weekend reporters that the highest coupon rate for non-standard products in Zhenjiang was around 9%. The employee said that at first Zhenjiang’s district and county urban investment platforms were issuing such products, probably because of the difficulty in financing, but later they were concentrated on municipal platforms with larger assets. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Support from provincial governments&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Zhenjiang Municipal Government began to solve the urban investment debt problem before the risk occurred. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of 2019, news leaked out of the market that the China Development Bank would replace Zhenjiang’s implicit debt at a cost of 20 billion yuan a year for 2 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of that year, Zheng Zhijie, the former president of the China Development Bank, said at a forum, &quot;Zhenjiang has problems with high repayment pressure and high costs. Zhenjiang also wants to extend the term and reduce the current financial burden. I also We participated in the talks, but the Zhenjiang News plan was not approved by the Ministry of Finance.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2019, when talking about how to resolve the existing debt, Finance Minister Liu Kun stated that he would insist that the central government would not bail out. Who is responsible for borrowing money, so that &quot;whose family&#39;s children will be cared for&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the CDB’s plan was not passed, Jiangsu Province began to increase its debt support for Zhenjiang. The specific methods were to increase the scale of special bonds, reduce the financing pressure of urban investment platforms, and avoid relying on high-interest non-standard loans. product. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Special bonds of municipal and county governments are issued by provincial governments on their behalf. After counting the budget implementation status of various regions in Jiangsu, it can be found that the scale of special debt in Zhenjiang in 2019 increased by 34.6 billion yuan compared with the previous year. Among the 13 prefecture-level cities in Jiangsu, Zhenjiang is the place with the largest increase in the scale of special debt. In 2020, the scale of Zhenjiang&#39;s special bonds increased by 42.5 billion year-on-year, also exceeding other regions in the province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the large-scale issuance of special bonds, the scale of Zhenjiang government debt has changed accordingly. According to data such as Zhenjiang City&#39;s budget implementation, Zhenjiang City&#39;s government debt scale was 109.7 billion yuan in 2019, which is not outstanding in the province. In 2021, the debt will rise to 191.8 billion yuan, second only to Nanjing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, Zhenjiang also replaced high-cost hidden debts by issuing replacement bonds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 2019 financial accounts of Danyang City and Dantu District under the jurisdiction of Zhenjiang, the replacement of hidden debts was mentioned. According to the final accounts report of Danyang City, the government bonds issued by Jiangsu Province in 2019 totaled 5.3 billion yuan, of which 1.4 billion yuan were replacement bonds, accounting for 26%. The replacement bonds were used to repay the existing implicit government debt of platform companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dantu District also revealed in its final accounting report that it issued 679 million yuan of existing replacement bonds to repay existing hidden debts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“In response to financial and debt risks, we have taken measures such as curbing growth, adjusting structure, and reducing costs. The total amount of government debt and costs have ‘double decreased’.” Zhenjiang Municipal Government’s 2021 Work Report wrote. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Enterprise Early Warning Data, Zhenjiang’s urban investment interest-bearing debt increased by 200 million yuan year-on-year in 2021, with little change; in 2022, urban investment’s interest-bearing debt was 340.5 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 9.7 billion Yuan. In other words, the debt scale of Zhenjiang’s urban investment platforms has been controlled and is trending down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many urban investment practitioners in Jiangsu told Southern Weekend reporters that the most critical factor in Zhenjiang’s debt-oriented development is the financial and policy support from Jiangsu Province. For a long time, Jiangsu&#39;s GDP has ranked second in the country and has strong economic strength. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The official website of the Lianyungang government shows that on May 27, 2022, the north-south paired assistance meeting between Wuxi and Lianyungang was officially held. For more than 20 years, Lianyungang has been supported by Zhenjiang. For Zhenjiang, withdrawing from assistance can alleviate some of the financial pressure. In addition, changing Lianyungang&#39;s sponsor from Zhenjiang to Wuxi also requires coordination from provincial government departments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Zhenjiang also has professional cadres handling debt matters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2020, Zhou Kai, then vice president of Bank of Jiangsu, was transferred to deputy mayor of Zhenjiang City. Previously, he worked at China Construction Bank Jiangsu Branch, Bank of Nanjing and Bank of Jiangsu for more than 20 years. According to the official website of the Zhenjiang Municipal Government, Zhou Kai is in charge of the local financial regulatory bureau, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, municipal state-owned enterprises, etc., and assists in being in charge of the Finance Bureau. The deputy mayor must also be nominated by the Organization Department of the Provincial Party Committee. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Reduce financing costs&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2021, Jiangsu Province issued the &quot;Guiding Opinions on Regulating the Investment and Financing Behavior of Financing Platform Companies&quot;, requiring guidance for financing platform companies to gradually reduce trust and capital costs. management plans, financial leasing, private equity funds and various non-standard products issued on local trading venues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to replacing hidden debt with bonds, Zhenjiang also received assistance from banks to increase credit and reduce financing costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhenjiang Communications Industry Group (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 混体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as &quot;Zhenjiang Communications Investment&quot;&lt;/span>;) wrote in the bond prospectus , with the coordination and support of government resources, since 2020, the total amount of corporate bank credit has increased, high-interest non-standard financing has been cleared to a greater extent, the debt composition and financing costs have been better improved, and financing costs have decreased by 0.84% ​​compared with 2019. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After analyzing bond prospectuses, Southern Weekend reporters found that between 2020 and 2023, the top four urban investment platforms in Zhenjiang in terms of asset size have all seen sharp declines in non-standard financing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, the one with the largest scale reduction is Zhenjiang Communications Investment. In March 2020, the amount of non-standard financing in Zhenjiang was 15.3 billion yuan, accounting for 25.86% of the total financing scale; in March 2023, the amount of non-standard financing was 5.555 billion yuan, accounting for 10% of the total financing scale. Compared with three years ago, it dropped by 9.745 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Lin works at a municipal urban investment platform in Zhenjiang. He told Southern Weekend reporters that the company had cleared away other high-cost non-standard products, except for short-term emergency financing, which could only be done after filing. According to the person from the above-mentioned financing intermediary company, there are currently no non-standard products for the public in Zhenjiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2023, many places in Jiangsu have announced the upper limit of financing interest rates for urban investment. Several people from Zhenjiang&#39;s urban investment platform told Southern Weekend reporters that the upper limit of Zhenjiang&#39;s external financing costs is 6.7%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, this interest rate is at a medium level in Jiangsu Province. A staff member of an urban investment platform in Nanjing told Southern Weekend reporters that the local urban investment financing limit is 4.2% (five-year LPR), which is almost the strictest regulation in Jiangsu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to people from the above-mentioned financing intermediary companies, some urban investment platforms in Jiangsu can issue fixed financing products with interest rates of up to 7%-8%. &quot;Actually, the upper limit of issuance cost is 6.699%.&quot; Zhang Lin said that if the red line of 6.7% cannot be reached, &quot;lower cost financing must be achieved.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2022, the Zhenjiang Municipal State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission issued a document stating that for high-cost financing projects that meet or exceed the financing cost control price determined by the municipal government, the &quot;High-cost Debt Management Approval Form&quot; must be filled out one by one in advance 》, after the enterprise implements the internal decision-making procedures, it can be carried out after being reviewed by the Municipal State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, reported to the leaders of the municipal government for approval, and reported to the Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision for filing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned Nanjing Urban Investment person also revealed that if the cost of a financing reaches 5%, the district will advise you not to do it. If there is real financial pressure, the district will coordinate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Zhenjiang City State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission’s document also mentioned that it is necessary to clarify the mutual insurance quotas of enterprises based on the financing needs and affordability of relevant enterprises, implement total amount control, and prevent cross-conduction of debt risks and unlimited extension of debt chains. In principle No guarantee shall be provided in excess of the mutual insurance limit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years, the mutual guarantee situation among Zhenjiang municipal-level urban investment companies has not been optimistic, with Zhenjiang Cultural Tourism being the most serious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Its bond prospectus shows that as of the end of March 2020, the issuer’s external guarantee balance totaled 16.7 billion yuan, accounting for 97.93% of net assets. The company provides relatively large amounts of external guarantees, mainly to state-owned enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Recovering economic losses of nearly 1.6 billion yuan”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the basis of specifying the upper limit of financing costs, Zhenjiang and other places in Jiangsu are further reducing financing intermediary fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2019, the Zhenjiang Municipal Party Committee wrote in a report on the progress of inspections and rectifications that it is necessary to further standardize the decision-making and operating procedures of financing projects, strictly control intermediary agency service fees, formulate intermediary agency service management methods, and adopt intermediary Institutional access system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Incorporate the intermediate business expenses in the credit link into the total cost and determine them together, require all municipal industrial groups to register their accounts in detail, and eliminate the payment of financing and financial advisory fees to third-party non-financial institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Some urban investment platforms are controlled by intermediaries, and there is no way around them.” Li Yu has worked in many financial leasing companies. He told Southern Weekend reporters that intermediaries generally have a close relationship with the leaders of urban investment companies. Internet, &quot;Even if the cost is low, urban investment will not do business with you, you must go through an intermediary.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yu said that after the intermediary participates, it will push up the financing cost. For example, if 6% of the cost can be financed, the final cost will be 8%, and the middle 2% will be between the intermediary, urban investment, and investors. divided into. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An article published on the website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Supervisory Commission stated that since the launch of a special rectification of corruption issues in the financing field in January 2022, the Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision of Zhenjiang City, Jiangsu Province has filed a total of 22 cases and investigated party members and cadres, including those at the county level. With 3 cadres, nearly 1.6 billion yuan in economic losses were recovered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the special rectification, the Zhenjiang Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision comprehensively reviewed the financing business of platform companies at the municipal, county and township levels in the past ten years, focusing on and verifying financing projects whose comprehensive financing costs significantly exceeded the market interest rate. , sorting out financing projects with major doubts such as illegal payment of intermediary fees and abnormal comprehensive financing costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, it was discovered that a number of fund &quot;brokers&quot; were involved in cross-regional financing business and obtained high intermediary fees, as well as bribing platform company officials. A total of 10 fund &quot;brokers&quot; were investigated and punished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yu revealed that this year, government staff from a certain place in Jiangsu came to a financial leasing company where he previously worked and demanded the return of funds that were higher than the upper limit of financing costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, urban investment platforms across Jiangsu are very sensitive to financing costs. In October, at a financing negotiation meeting of a certain urban investment company in Jiangsu, Southern Weekend reporters saw an executive repeatedly negotiating with bank staff, hoping that the other party could reduce the channel fee of 3‰. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Now when the person in charge of an urban investment company goes to the government for a meeting, the first thing he reports is not the current status of the company’s operations, but the situation of debt repayment.” A Zhenjiang urban investment practitioner said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Wang Li’s view, Zhenjiang Urban Investment’s debt has not been significantly compressed, but the internal debt structure has been well adjusted, non-standard financing has accounted for a low proportion, and the debt can survive stably. “What financial institutions value most is Or debt stability.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Li’s company has conducted statistics and found that the number of new financial leases in Jiangsu in 2022 dropped by 40% year-on-year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years, governments at all levels in Zhenjiang have also revitalized state-owned assets to relieve financial pressure. In 2018, Zhenjiang City&#39;s state-owned capital operating income was only 568 million yuan, and it reached 4.854 billion yuan in 2020, mainly coming from property rights transfer income at the municipal level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the number of high-quality state-owned assets is limited and this income is difficult to sustain. In 2022, state-owned capital operating income will drop to 585 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years, with the help of the provincial government and financial institutions, Zhenjiang has improved its debt structure by curbing the increase in debt and replacing high-interest debt. Coupled with the recovery of financing intermediary fees and the establishment of financing cost ceilings and other control measures, the debt ratio has been steadily reduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2023, the Zhenjiang Municipal Government’s work report revealed that in 2022, in response to financial debt risks, the government will strengthen the concept of “debt reduction is also political achievement” and further promote “redundancy reduction” and “peak reduction”. Four plans, annual goals and tasks were fully achieved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beginning in 2019, the Ministry of Finance established a local government debt risk rating mechanism, dividing debt risks into red (debt rate ≥ 300%), orange (200% ≤ debt rate &lt; 300%), yellow There are four levels: (120% ≤ debt ratio &lt; 200%) and green (debt ratio &lt; 120%). &quot;Going off the red&quot; refers to the debt risk level that leaves the red. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 16, 2023, in response to issues related to Zhenjiang’s chemical debt, Southern Weekend reporters called the Zhenjiang Municipal Finance Bureau, but the other party declined the interview request. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(At the request of the interviewees, Wang Li, Zhang Lin and Li Yu are pseudonyms in the article.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; /p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
