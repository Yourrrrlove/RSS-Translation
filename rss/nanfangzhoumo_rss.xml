This means that the two companies are no longer government financing platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar actions have occurred frequently across Jiangsu in the past year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics from Southern Weekend reporters, from December 2022 to the present (as of September 26, 2023), a total of 215 urban investment companies in Jiangsu have announced their withdrawal from government financing platforms, involving 7 prefecture-level cities including Suzhou and Changzhou. city. There are 13 prefecture-level cities in Jiangsu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the same period, some urban investment companies in Henan, Liaoning and other provinces also announced their withdrawal from government financing platforms, but only a few of them. This time, why did Jiangsu take such drastic measures to ask local urban investment companies to withdraw from the government financing platform? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/lFAFmo4x70PlglflyM6y0l9caeUdVMaAlnMHjGT3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1266&quot; height= &quot;948&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/lFAFmo4x70PlglflyM6y0l9caeUdVMaAlnMHjGT3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252479&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;From December 2022 to the present (as of September 26, 2023), a total of 215 urban investment companies in Jiangsu have announced their withdrawal from government financing platforms, involving 7 prefecture-level cities including Suzhou and Changzhou . &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Four ways to exit government financing platforms&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p >;According to many urban investment practitioners in Jiangsu, the withdrawal of local urban investment companies from the government financing platform refers to the withdrawal from Jiangsu’s comprehensive local debt supervision platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Being the first in the country to establish a full-scale debt management system covering government debt, government implicit debt, and operating debt of financing platform companies.” In August 2023, the Jiangsu Provincial Audit Office announced the 2022 Provincial Audit results of level-level budget execution and other fiscal revenue and expenditures&quot; said when reviewing the work in 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Implicit debt refers to debts borrowed by local governments beyond the statutory government debt limit, either directly or by promising to repay with fiscal funds, or by illegally providing guarantees. The debt-raising entities are usually local urban investment companies. Like government debt, local governments need to bear the repayment responsibility for implicit debts, while the operating debt of urban investment companies has nothing to do with the government. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2022, a procurement document from the Gansu Provincial Department of Finance showed that the Ministry of Finance had established a full-caliber debt monitoring platform system. Among them, the hidden debt monitoring system counts and monitors changes in existing hidden debts on a monthly basis. In addition, there is a system for real-time statistical monitoring of financing platform debt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the Ministry of Finance’s debt monitoring platform, Jiangsu has also established its own local debt supervision system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2019, a procurement announcement issued by the Wuxi Municipal Finance Bureau revealed that according to the work deployment requirements of the Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection and the Provincial Department of Finance, the Wuxi Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and the Wuxi Municipal Finance Bureau purchased debts in Xinwu District On the basis of the system, we will optimize, improve, deeply develop and pilot the comprehensive supervision system for local government debt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The local government comprehensive debt supervision system has been affirmed by the Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision, and has been designated for promotion and application in 13 prefecture-level cities across the province.&quot; The official website of Wuxi Big Data Administration Bureau said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People from urban investment companies in Guizhou and other places told Southern Weekend reporters that local urban investment debt data mainly relies on the statistics of the Ministry of Finance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Regional governments should strengthen the full-scale debt monitoring and control of financing platform companies, and comprehensively understand the bottom line of government hidden debts, operating debts and contingent liabilities of financing platform companies.” In 2021, Jiangsu Province issued the “ &quot;Guiding Opinions on Regulating the Investment and Financing Behavior of Financing Platform Companies&quot; (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Guiding Opinions on Financing Platforms&quot;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, the operating debt of Jiangsu Urban Investment Company has also been included in the debt supervision system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But how do urban investment companies withdraw from government financing platforms? A table obtained by Southern Weekend reporters shows that a prefecture-level city in Jiangsu is compiling a list of urban investment companies that will withdraw from fiscal supervision in 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The table indicates that there are four types of exit: withdrawal from the regulatory scope due to the lifting of the guarantee relationship, cancellation (the debt has been cleared), merger into other platform companies (debts are transferred to other platform companies), and marketization Transform into a non-platform state-owned enterprise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the announcements from local governments in Jiangsu, the main exit type of urban investment platforms is to transform into non-platform enterprises, which is generally expressed as: &quot;Transform into market-oriented operating entities and withdraw from government financing platforms from the date of announcement.&quot; , no longer assumes government financing functions, operates independently in accordance with the law as an independent market entity, and is responsible for its own profits and losses.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Urban investment companies across Jiangsu have transformed into non-platform state-owned enterprises and need to clear their hidden debts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2022, Jiangdu District, Yangzhou City issued a financing platform integration and cleanup plan. The document states that for companies with a certain asset scale and management capabilities, the government&#39;s implicit debts will be paid off, financing functions will be divested, and market-oriented transformation will be achieved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person who works for a city investment platform in Jiangsu told Southern Weekend reporters that the company’s hidden debts have been cleared before an announcement is made in 2022 to transform into a non-platform enterprise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics from Southern Weekend reporters, 8 of the 215 urban investment companies in Jiangsu that have withdrawn from government financing platforms have been cancelled. In addition, the above form requires filling in the reasons for the urban investment company to be placed under supervision, the balance of implicit debt, the balance of operating debt, and the type of exit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that industrial and commercial data show that among the 215 companies, 192 are subsidiaries at all levels and are not directly affiliated with administrative institutions. There are only 80 urban investment companies with renewal bonds, bank borrowings, accounts receivable financing, and financial leasing. Among them, only 7 companies have renewal bonds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the urban investment company has financing capabilities, especially if it has issued bonds, it means that the company has a large asset scale and has certain operating capabilities, and is not a shell company. Data from the Enterprise Early Warning Channel show that among the 215 urban investment companies, the 2022 industrial and commercial information of 112 companies shows zero employees or no information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, a large number of urban investment companies that have withdrawn from government financing platforms have small asset sizes or are shell companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Withdrawal from the original CBRC supervision list&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In fact, there have been cases of urban investment companies withdrawing from government financing platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Around 2011, the former China Banking Regulatory Commission began to implement a &quot;list system&quot; management of urban investment platforms. The list was updated every quarter, which affected the financing activities of urban investment platforms such as bank loans and the issuance of public bonds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, the former China Banking Regulatory Commission suspended statistics on the list. Guangdong Securities Research Report shows that as of the end of 2018, there were 11,737 financing platforms on the list, of which 2,710 have been gradually removed, leaving 9,027. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past decade or so, urban investment companies in various regions have withdrawn from government financing platforms, mainly referring to withdrawing from the supervision list of urban investment platforms by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2015, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of Fujian Nanping City issued an announcement stating that by actively strengthening communication and approval with the government and the China Banking Regulatory Commission, one of its urban investment companies was officially withdrawn from the government financing platform, &quot;marking the The company&#39;s market-oriented financing functions have been fully restored.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to ease financing pressure, various places are trying to find ways to withdraw from the regulatory list. However, according to a document issued by the former China Banking Regulatory Commission in 2013, multiple conditions need to be met to exit the regulatory list of urban investment companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, if the asset-liability ratio is below 70%, the financial report has been audited by an accounting firm; the part of existing loans that requires financial repayment has been included in local fiscal budget management, and the source of budget funds has been implemented, and the existing The mortgage guarantee, loan term, repayment method, etc. of the loan have been rectified and qualified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An urban investment practitioner in Jiangsu told a Southern Weekend reporter that another purpose for urban investment companies in various regions to withdraw from the original regulatory list of the China Banking Regulatory Commission is to participate in government PPP projects as social capital parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, the former China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission issued the &quot;Guiding Opinions on Banking and Insurance Institutions to Further Prevent and Resolve Local Government Hidden Debt Risks&quot;, requiring that it is strictly prohibited to provide current loans to borrowers who bear local government hidden debts. , it is strictly prohibited to add or falsely resolve hidden government debts, further limiting the financing space of urban investment companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the original CBRC urban investment supervision list stopped updating, it is still functioning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There is a bank credit line, but the loan cannot be released.” Huang Hui, a staff member of an urban investment company in Shandong, told Southern Weekend reporters that after the above-mentioned Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission document was released, because it was on the regulatory list , the company&#39;s liquidity loans were greatly restricted. Since then, the company has repaid hidden debts through financial fund repayment and other methods. It was not until it was withdrawn from the regulatory list last year that financing returned to normal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years, urban investment companies in Henan, Liaoning and other places have also withdrawn from government financing platforms, but they have not specified what kind of platforms. In addition, multiple announcements show that county-level government units can approve the withdrawal of urban investment companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2020, the Tanghe County Government in Henan Province issued an announcement stating that after research and approval by the county government, it was decided that Tanghe County Hongxiang Investment Group Co., Ltd. would be a market-oriented transformation entity and would withdraw from the government from the date of the announcement. investment platform. In May 2022, the Dalian Pulandian District government also approved eight urban investment companies to withdraw from the government financing platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In contrast, when urban investment companies across Jiangsu withdraw from financing platforms, they need to report to the provincial and municipal governments and wait for approval. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Since this year, 18 companies have applied to the province and city to withdraw from the financing platform supervision system.&quot; In September 2023, the &quot;Sheyang County Party Committee&#39;s Report on the Progress of Inspections&quot; was released on the official website of the Jiangsu Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision. ” wrote. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the announcements of various localities withdrawing from financing platforms, the core content is to explain to the outside world that urban investment companies will no longer assume government financing functions and will separate subsequent borrowing from government debt. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Reduce the number of financing platforms&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The official websites of Jiangsu county and district governments show that in 2022, Jiangsu will begin to reduce the number of urban investment platforms on a large scale and set goals . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, Jurong City, Jiangsu Province released the &quot;Pilot Work Plan for Reducing the Number of Financing Platform Companies from 2022 to 2026&quot;, which stated that the number of financing platform companies will be reduced year by year, and the number of 10 financing platform companies will be reduced by 2022. By 2023, it is planned to reduce the number of 15 financing platform companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Promote the integration, mergers, and market-oriented transformation of financing platform companies.” In July 2023, Wang Tianqi, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, emphasized at a meeting that the high-cost debt “peak reduction operation” will continue to be carried out , implement “one account, one policy” guidance for financing platform companies with high market attention, large existing debt scale, concentrated payment periods, and tight capital chains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Now when the person in charge of an urban investment company goes to the government for a meeting, the first thing he reports is not the current status of the company’s operations, but the situation of debt reduction.” A Jiangsu urban investment practitioner said that debt reduction and the extended Tasks such as financing platform integration are the most important things for urban investment companies at the moment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The government is accelerating the integration of financing platforms because Jiangsu has a large number of urban investment companies at the county, district and even town and street levels. They generally have heavy debt burdens, small market sizes, and poor operating capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2023, the Jiangsu Provincial State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission introduced in reply to a CPPCC proposal that among the province’s financing platform companies, county (district) level and development zone, functional zone and township-level financing platform companies accounted for Compared to nearly 90%. Judging from the total amount of state-owned assets and operating debt, counties (districts) account for more than half. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, among the number of platforms to be reduced this time, county and township-level financing platforms are the focus. In the above form of a prefecture-level city in Jiangsu, it is required to fill in whether it is a township-level platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2023, government departments in Dafeng District of Yancheng City, Qingjiangpu District of Huai&#39;an City, and Yangzhou District of Zhenjiang have successively issued announcements stating that all town-level financing platforms will be integrated into the district and county level, or that township-level financing platforms will be completely cancelled. platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, the 14th Jiangsu Provincial Committee conducted two rounds of inspections in 44 counties and districts. Jiangsu has a total of 95 counties and districts. Public information shows that the rectification progress of the two rounds of inspections will be announced to the public in January 2023 and September 2023 respectively. On the eve of the announcement of the rectification progress, it was the time when urban investment companies intensively issued announcements to withdraw from the financing platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Statistics from Southern Weekend reporters found that among the rectification reports of 44 counties and districts, 21 counties and districts mentioned the integration or reduction of the number of urban investment platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Ming is an executive of a consulting company in Beijing, mainly providing transformation consulting services to urban investment platforms. He told Southern Weekend reporters that the withdrawal of financing platforms across Jiangsu was indeed related to inspections and rectifications. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Ming explained that some time ago, a Jiangsu urban investment platform contacted him, saying that after an inspection, he found that the local urban investment platform had heavy debts, dispersed assets, and many shell companies, and hoped to find a solution to reduce the number of platforms. Improve the financing capabilities of the capital market. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Can it be truly transformed&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;More than 200 urban investment companies in Jiangsu have withdrawn from the financing platform. What impact will it have on the market? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 25, 2023, Huafu Securities statistics found that among the 287 urban investment companies across the country that had withdrawn from financing platforms, the bond trading activity on the bond issuance platform was not high. The average monthly transaction volume from January to August 2023 is generally low, mostly below 10%. Four platforms even had no transaction volume during the year. Their activity is generally low and they receive less attention from the capital market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ren Hua is the person in charge of a financial leasing company in Shanghai. His main customer groups are urban investment platforms across Jiangsu. Ren Hua told Southern Weekend reporters that they had investigated the withdrawal of platforms in Jiangsu and found that none of the major financing platforms in various places had withdrawn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;If it is still a financing platform, urban investment bonds can be renewed by borrowing new ones and repaying old ones. But if it withdraws from the list, financing will depend on its ability.&quot; Ren Hua explained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Generally speaking, large and medium-sized urban investment companies have one or more strong main businesses. For smaller urban investment platforms, how to achieve true transformation and have sustainable operating capabilities without relying on government infrastructure and other projects is a more difficult problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Wu Ming, when urban investment platforms across Jiangsu consulted him, &quot;how to maintain sustainable operating capabilities&quot; was also a frequently asked question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the inspection and rectification reports of the above-mentioned 21 counties and districts, the approach taken by each locality is to integrate financing platforms for similar businesses and clarify the main business direction of each company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, Feng County’s inspection and rectification report stated that four groups were established: urban construction, industrial investment, agriculture and water, and Xinfeng, and their main businesses were respectively approved for urban construction, park development, agriculture and water tourism, and financial services. plate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, compared with market-oriented transformation, cancellation and other methods, the resistance to integrating urban investment platforms is greater. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It’s like two families living together. The rich don’t like living with the poor.” An executive of an urban investment company in Guizhou told a Southern Weekend reporter that the local government had also planned to promote platform integration, but The effect is not good. &quot;If a bad enterprise is integrated and one of its loans is overdue, the entire group will be overdue.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the effect of the transformation of urban investment companies across Jiangsu remains to be seen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huafu Securities research report shows that among the bond-issuing urban investment platforms that will withdraw from the platform in 2021-2022, except for Chibi Urban Construction, Licheng State Investment and other platforms, there are small-scale business fluctuations, and most urban investment platforms The role of undertaking local infrastructure business has not changed, the proportion of public welfare and quasi-public welfare business is still high, and there is no obvious market-oriented transformation trend at the business level. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(At the request of the interviewees, Ren Hua, Wu Ming, and Huang Hui are pseudonyms.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 30 Sep 2023 18:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[自西徂东：秦国崛起的四级跳 | 古国多少事②]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257343]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-30 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;It is about 400 kilometers from the Dabaozi Mountain tombs to the ruins of the front hall of Afang Palace, a 5-hour drive; more than 2,000 Years ago, it took those vague-faced Qin people more than six hundred years to reach the same distance. Thirty generations of people are rushing one after another, rushing towards a new starting point - surprisingly, the new starting point is also the eternal end point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/aO56Nv9LO7BX4SFu59J6CyNdlMUphQaKAHH8vVRV.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;643&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/aO56Nv9LO7BX4SFu59J6CyNdlMUphQaKAHH8vVRV.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;131200&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Painted bronze chariots and horses in the Qin Shihuang Terracotta Warriors and Horses Museum&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC Photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt; h3>;Starting: Looking for the Meeting of Ganwei and West Inuqiu&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The afternoon sunshine is precious, especially in late autumn when the frost and wind are tight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Between the two mountains is a river and its alluvial valley. The river is clear and shallow, and the reed flowers look like snow. At the fork in the road, I asked two old men sunbathing for directions. Afterwards, the car passed through the village road and turned onto a rough dirt road. There are twists and turns, and on the other side of the mountain, withered yellow weeds dance in the wind, hiding countless pits and caves. Some pits also have red warning signs: Archaeological site, no entry allowed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What I saw was part of a tomb complex covering an area of ​​18 square kilometers. Just under these decaying weeds and trees, in the 1990s, archaeologists excavated 4 large tombs and 9 small and medium-sized tombs, as well as a large number of funerary objects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The owner of the tomb pointed to a tribe called Qin that was active in Longdong and Guanzhong more than 2,000 years ago. Their leader was the direct ancestor of Qin Shihuang, the later emperor of the ages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to &quot;Historical Records&quot;, the Qin people are descendants of Zhuan Xu. Among Zhuanxu&#39;s descendants, there was one named Dafei, also known as Boyi and Baiyi. Dafei lived during the eras of Shun and Yu. He first assisted Yu in water control, and then tamed birds and beasts for Shun. &quot;Many birds and beasts were tamed&quot;; so Shun gave him the surname Ying. This is the origin of Qin Shihuang&#39;s family name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fei Chang is a descendant of Da Fei and has superb royal skills. When Cheng Tang attacked Xia Jie, it was Fei Chang who drove the car. During the Shang generation, the Ying family was highly valued by the King of Shang. At the end of the Shang Dynasty, Feilian and his son Wei Lai &quot;both used their talents and abilities to serve the Yin Dynasty&quot;. After the fall of the Shang Dynasty, the Ying family, as a stubborn reactionary force of the Yin and Shang Dynasties, was moved by the King of Zhou to the western border area - mainly today&#39;s Tianshui and Longnan areas of Gansu Province. At that time, they lived together with the nomadic people called Rong or Xirong. The environment was harsh and their survival was difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the reign of King Mu of Zhou Dynasty, the Ying family gave birth to another man with superb royal skills, named Zaofu. Zaofu once drove to the west with King Mu, and when King Xu Yan rebelled, he accompanied King Mu to the east. Therefore, King Mu granted the city of Zhao to Zaofu. Zaofu took Zhao as his surname, which was the origin of the Zhao family. Qin and Zhao, who later fought endless wars, were actually brothers of the same clan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Qin Shihuang&#39;s family does not belong to the Cepheid branch - Qin Shihuang&#39;s family is the descendant of Erai, and Cepheus is the descendant of Erlai&#39;s brother Ji Sheng. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back on the past events of the Qin Kingdom, Feizi is a key figure that cannot be ignored. If the later Qin State was like a big tree with lush branches and leaves, then Feizi was the first root of this big tree. Because, starting from Feizi, Qin only existed in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feizi’s father is Da Luo. While the descendants of Zaofu from the same clan were in great turmoil in the Zhao region, Daluo was still trapped in Xiquanqiu (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;, also known as Xicui, today&#39;s Li County, Gansu&lt; /span>;), surrounded by Rong tribes, trying to survive in the cracks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like his ancestors who spent a lot of money, Feizi also &quot;good at horses and livestock, and good at raising them.&quot; At that time, horses were both an important source of power and an indispensable part of the chariot. For a country or tribe, the number of horses plays a decisive role. King Xiao of Zhou summoned Feizi to the meeting of Miwei to raise horses for the royal family. As a result, &quot;the horses have a good rest&quot; - the horses are fat and strong, and they give birth to many foals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For many years, scholars have debated endlessly about the location of the Miwei Society. Qian is the Mi River and Wei is the Wei River. Mihe River, also known as Qianhe River, is a tributary of Weihe River. The Meeting of Mi and Wei is also called between Mi and Wei. Therefore, this land with rich water and grass suitable for livestock grazing should be within the angle formed by Qianhe River and Wei River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lianhuo Expressway runs from east to west, parallel to the Wei River. After passing Guo Town, from the north bank of Weihe River to the south bank, the overpass led me to the Baoji Transit Expressway. 10 kilometers westbound, a bridge spans from east to west. The river surface is very narrow, but the river bed is extremely wide, spreading like a plain all the way to the distant green mountains. This is Qianhe. A few hundred meters south of the window on my left, Qianhe flows into the Weihe River. To the northwest outside the window on my right, the urban area with dense buildings and factories was Feizi&#39;s pasture more than two thousand years ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, a wetland park covering an area of ​​more than ten square kilometers has been built at the intersection of Qianhe River and Weihe River. Although the Qianhe and Weihe rivers I saw were both narrow and not rich in water, their wide river beds made people imagine that when the rainy season comes, they must be big and turbulent rivers. It was late autumn, and the grass and trees on the riverbed in the distance and on the mesa further away were still green, which seemed to imply that this was a good place for the growth of grass and trees, as well as cattle and horses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/ItLzMP5lAyMXgjyz32EEdUT72SVUf82KJZkX0Qmu.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/ItLzMP5lAyMXgjyz32EEdUT72SVUf82KJZkX0Qmu.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;131201&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Feizi Muma&#39;s meeting in Qianwei&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Nie Zuoping/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;Feizi&#39;s achievements in raising horses were richly rewarded: King Zhou Xiao planned to make him the heir to his father Da Luo. However, King Xiao&#39;s plan will definitely harm the interests of Feizi&#39;s half-brother Cheng Cheng, whose maternal grandfather was a very influential Marquis Shen in the Western Zhou Dynasty. Marquis Shen firmly objected, so King Xiao had to adopt a compromise approach - he said: In the past, he spent a lot of money to take charge of livestock for Shun, so Shun gave him the surname Ying. Now his descendants raise horses for me, and I divide the land into vassals. So, his reward to Feizi was: &quot;Qin in the city&quot;. That is to say, the land of Qin was granted to Feizi and he was named Qin Ying. The rank given to Feizi was vassal - the so-called vassal, whose title was lower than that of the prince Bo Zinan, and whose fiefdom did not exceed 50 miles. The prince was not qualified to directly meet the emperor and was attached to a certain prince. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although his status is insignificant - in comparison, Song is a duke, Qi and Jin are marquis, Zheng is an earl, and Chu is a viscount - when the princes met for an alliance, the king of Chu was too low in rank. He was not even qualified to enter the venue, and Feizi&#39;s level was even lower than Chuzi&#39;s. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, no matter how low the title is, it also means that Feizi, a member of the Ying clan, has not only obtained a formal title, but also has a hereditary territory; more importantly, from now on, the world has Qin and Qin people - the first Qin person was none other than Fei Zi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Where is the Qin that King Zhou Xiao conferred on Feizi? Historical data shows that it was in the Zhangjiachuan and Qingshui areas of Gansu Province. There are different opinions on the more specific location: it is believed to be in Qinting Township, Qingshui, and it is believed to be in Waquan Village, Zhangjiachuan. In fact, the two places are only twenty or thirty kilometers apart, so they may both be Feizi&#39;s fiefdoms. Not only that, but Mumatan in Maiji District, more than 80 kilometers to the south, is also considered Feizi&#39;s territory. More than two thousand years ago, this area was vast and sparsely populated. Feizi and his people drove herds of livestock and lived in pursuit of water and grass. Cattle and sheep multiplied, the population multiplied, and Ying Qin grew stronger step by step like a snowball. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xirong is the collective name given by the Huaxia people to other ethnic groups living in the northwest region during the pre-Qin period. Compared with the Huaxia people, Xirong is culturally backward, advocates force, is aggressive, and often conflicts with the Huaxia people. The ancestors of the Zhou Dynasty originally lived in Bin (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;today&#39;s Bin County and Xunyi area of ​​Shaanxi Province&lt;/span>;). Due to the long-term invasion by the Western Rong, they had to move east. Moved to Zhouyuan. Feizi&#39;s ancestors were originally moved to Xiquanqiu by the King of Zhou as a border guard. Their mission was: &quot;Be in Xirong and protect Xichui.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gui is a food vessel made of bronze and is often used together with a tripod. In 1980, a Gui with a missing cover was unearthed from a Western Zhou tomb in Tengzhou, Shandong. The inscription on the gui shows that its owner cannot call him, so he calls him &quot;not his gui&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The inscription on Buqi Gui tells the story of Buqi receiving the order from the King of Zhou and his relationship with the invading Yan Xun (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;i.e. The 烃狁 (a branch of the Rong) fought in Gaoling, winning three times in three battles, and was rewarded by the King of Zhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Who is it? He is Feizi&#39;s great-great-grandson Duke Zhuang of Qin. During the reign of Qin Zhong, the father of Duke Zhuang of Qin, the Xirong army attacked Xiquqiu, and the descendants of Feizi&#39;s brother Cheng were wiped out. The consequence of this incident was that the Feizi lineage, which was originally a branch of the Ying family, became the authentic sect of the Ying family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;King Xuan of Zhou appointed Qin Zhong as his official to attack Xirong. However, the isolated Qin people were no match for Xirong, and Qin Zhong died in the battle. After Qin Zhong&#39;s death, his five sons, including Bu Qi, were filled with grief and anger, and asked King Xuan of Zhou to send troops. King Xuan sent a team of 7,000 people, together with the Qin people, to defeat Xirong around 820 BC and regained Xiquqiu, which was occupied by Xirong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the war, King Xuan of Zhou appointed Duke Zhuang of Qin as the doctor of Xicui and gave him Xiquanqiu. As a result, the activity center of the Qin people for several generations since Feizi moved from today&#39;s Tianshui area to the Li County area in Longnan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dabaozi Mountain is more than ten kilometers away from Lixian County, and the Western Han River flows slowly between the two mountains. Many cultural relics unearthed here show that this is a long-standing Qin clan tomb. In fact, long before the country officially conducted archeology, many cultural relic dealers went to the Dabaozi Mountain area to rob tombs, and a large number of precious cultural relics flowed from here to all over the world. Bao Bao, a poet from Li County, told me that when he was a boy, farmers working in the fields often dug out some bronze utensils. Experts have determined that this is the Xicui Cemetery, one of the four major cemeteries of the Qin people. So, who is the most likely Qin Jun sleeping in Dabaozi Mountain? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/0STMPyplaX7gaKEdmtZJriuhSDe0SHGnvbLdtj1A.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/0STMPyplaX7gaKEdmtZJriuhSDe0SHGnvbLdtj1A.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;131202&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Qin Tombs in Dabaozi Mountain, Li County&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Nie Zuoping/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >; Various clues point to Qin Xianggong. In the history of the development of the Qin State, Qin Xianggong not only established the country by chance, but also led the Qin people out of Longnan and marched into Guanzhong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the reign of Duke Xiang of Qin, the Emperor of Zhou was the mediocre King You of Zhou. King You deposed the eldest son and established a young one. The prince&#39;s maternal grandfather Shenhou joined forces with the Western Rong to attack Zhou. King You was killed and Shenhou&#39;s grandson came to the throne as King Ping of Zhou. King Ping moved the capital from Haojing to Luoyi, and history moved from the Western Zhou Dynasty to the Eastern Zhou Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When King Ping moved eastward, Jin, Wei, Zheng and other countries formed a coalition to escort him, and Qin people with much different ranks also joined the coalition. Afterwards, King Ping rewarded Qin Xianggong for his merits and promoted Qin Xianggong to an earl. This ended the Qin people&#39;s vassal career and promoted them to princes. At that time, it had been more than 130 years since Feizi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If Qin Xianggong is likely to be buried in the Xicui Cemetery in Dabaozi Mountain, then where is the Xicui Palace built during the Zhuanggong period, the first &quot;capital&quot; of the Qin people? ? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the tradition of the Qin people that the distance between the capital and the mausoleum is mostly between 5 and 15 kilometers, Xicui Palace is located near Dabaozi Mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of landform and environment, it is quite ingenious to choose the &quot;capital&quot; here: in the Dabaozi Mountain area, the Xihe River and the Xihan River meet, forming a fertile small basin. Dabaozi Mountain, with its steep western slope and gentle eastern slope, dominates it to the west. Yanguan, which is rich in salt, guards its east. Qishan Fort, which was once rated as one of the three major fortresses in the country by Emperor Wei Wen, controls it. More than 2,000 years ago, the climate here was warm and humid, with abundant rainfall and heat, suitable for farming and animal husbandry, and the products were abundant. The unique salt industry resources, coupled with the martial spirit of the Qin people tempered by years of battles and killings, although the population of the Qin people is still small, in hundreds of years, it will develop and grow bit by bit, and split into a world that is frightening. The Tiger and Wolf Qin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/yvIZFzFW3VigSBJZMrimO63Lgwy1ZLxqXAUkGYJP.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/yvIZFzFW3VigSBJZMrimO63Lgwy1ZLxqXAUkGYJP.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;131203&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Village at the foot of Dabaozi Mountain&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Nie Zuoping/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Inheritance: Loess Pingyang and Yongcheng under the Emperor&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;In 238 BC, Ying Zheng entered his 10th year of succession to the throne. In April of this year, he held a coronation ceremony, which meant that he began to rule personally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Surprisingly, the ceremony was not held in Xianyang, the capital of Qin, but in Yongcheng, 150 kilometers west of Xianyang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the young Ying Zheng, Yongcheng not only built a palace, but also buried many of his ancestors. It was of great significance in the history of Qin State to carry forward the past and open up the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The story has to start with King Ping of Zhou. In addition to making Qin a vassal, King Ping also wrote a blank check to the Qin people: he gave the Qin and Feng lands that had been occupied by the Xirong - roughly equivalent to today&#39;s Baoji, Shaanxi to Tianshui, Gansu - to the Qin people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After many years of bloody battles between Qin Xianggong and his son Qin Wengong, when Duke Wen of Qin arrived, the bad check was actually cashed: the Qin people took the land of Qifeng into their hands. Including the Miweihui, where Feizi used to herd horses for the King of Zhou, also returned to the Qin people after being lost for hundreds of years. Among them, the war against the Rong launched by Duke Wen in 750 BC &quot;collected the remaining Zhou people&quot; - after King Ping moved eastward, a large number of Zhou people remained in the Qifeng area. The Qin State not only occupied the land of Qifeng, but also Turn these Zhou people into Qin people. This also means that the Qin people have since entered the fertile Guanzhong Plain, and the center of gravity of rule has shifted from Longnan to central Shaanxi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qin Wengong, who has enjoyed the country for 50 years, is a powerful character. When he conquered Rongdong and entered the outside world, he had two major events worthy of note: one was the establishment of historians, and the history of Qin State has been recorded in writing; the other was the establishment of crimes against three tribes and torture. The later Qin State was famous for its harsh punishments, and the instigator was Duke Wen of Qin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Qin Wen Gong expanded eastward and stationed himself at Ma Miwei, he had to wait until his son Qin Xiangong to move the capital from Xiquanqiu to Pingyang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Near the Guozhen East Interchange of Lianhuo Expressway, about ten kilometers west of Qianweizhihui Wetland Park, fields and factories are mixed, and residential buildings and factories are intertwined. It is a typical urban-rural interface. In 1981, a batch of pre-Qin cultural relics were unearthed in this small place called Taigong Temple. Among them, the text on one clock indicates that the owner of the cultural relic is Qin Wugong. Correspondingly, a number of pre-Qin tombs have been discovered in the villages surrounding Taigong Temple. Based on this, some scholars believe that Pingyang, one of the capitals of the Qin State, is located in this area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/ble5aQijKbxbWmMx1IEtv0cvtDc1BvuLImM1CMds.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;617&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/ble5aQijKbxbWmMx1IEtv0cvtDc1BvuLImM1CMds.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;131204&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Location map of the four capitals of Qin&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Feng Qingchao/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qin Wu Just as his posthumous title suggests, Gong Gong: &quot;Being strong and straightforward is called martial arts, and punishing the people and overcoming them is called martial arts.&quot; Externally, he insisted on using troops to fight against the Western Rong; internally, he killed his three fathers and other powerful ministers to destroy the three tribes. In addition, he was also the first monarch in Qin to practice human sacrifice. After his death, the number of deceased persons reached 66. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it was another initiative of Qin Wugong that really had a significant impact on Qin and later China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the tenth year of Qin Wugong (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;688 BC&lt;/span>;), the Qin State captured the Kweichow (邽) from Xirong. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Now Qingshui, Gansu&lt;/span>;), Ji (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Today After the two places in Gansu (Gangu), instead of treating the gains from the expansion of territory as noble fiefs as in the past, they were established as counties and were managed by officials directly sent by the king. From the pre-Qin Dynasty to the present day, for more than two thousand years, counties have been the basic unit of administrative divisions in each era, and the right to invent them belonged to Qin Wugong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the capital of Qin, Pingyang only experienced two generations of monarchs, Xian Gong and Wu Gong. After Wu Gong&#39;s younger brother De Gong came to the throne, he moved the Qin capital from Pingyang to Yongcheng, more than 20 kilometers northwest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/oUEdvSprfqESr8OcmtwAxu9TEwNIeBC9T1PScSIv.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;635&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/oUEdvSprfqESr8OcmtwAxu9TEwNIeBC9T1PScSIv.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;131205&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Fengxiang East Lake, built for Su Dongpo&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC Photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On December 16, 1061, Su Dongpo, who had just arrived in Fengxiang for two days to take office as the judge, couldn&#39;t wait to rush to the Confucius Temple to see the long-famous stone drum. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The stone drum has 10 sides in total, each side is nearly 3 feet high and weighs a thousand kilograms. Today, more than 900 years later, they have gone through many twists and turns and are collected in the Palace Museum. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Each side of the stone drum is engraved with ancient inscriptions, which are called stone drum inscriptions. The owners of the stone drums each have different opinions: Qin Wengong, Qin Xuangong, Qin Mu Gong, Qin Xianggong, Qin Xiangong - no matter which Qin Gong, in short, they are all works of Qin people. The stone drum was unearthed in the south of Fengxiang City. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;石鼓上的文字，或讲述秦公出猎、渡河，或描绘秦国山河秀美壮丽，或歌颂秦军将士英勇善战——宛如一幅幅两千多年前的秦人浮世绘。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;凤翔，即雍城。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从秦德公前677年始，到秦献公前383年止，秦国建都雍城294年，先后有19位国君在此世代相传。近300年间，秦人在雍城大地上，留下了难以计数的遗址和遗迹。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;今天，凤翔是坐落于关中平原的一座小城。出城，麦地青青。城南五六公里的原野上，便是轰动一时的秦公一号大墓所在地。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我去秦公一号大墓那天下午，除了把门的工作人员，别无他人，园子空旷而安静。尽管我曾参观过相当数量的古代墓葬，但秦公一号大墓的宏伟仍让我吃惊：大墓平面呈中字形，中字那一竖是东西斜坡墓道，中间的口是墓室。整座墓全长达300米，其中墓室宽近40米，深近25米。墓室四壁有三级当年施工留下的台阶，使整座墓室呈倒金字塔状。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;资料介绍说，秦公一号大墓创下了迄今为止发掘的规模最大、殉人最多（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;186人&lt;/span>;）、墓具等级最高等五个中国考古之最。虽然从汉唐以来，大墓就遭到了两百多次盗掘，仍出土文物达三千五百余件。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/QCBzXSqJSYFFLbHdW5qpe0lv9Z3r9VmtFmgQqtR9.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;有个成语叫秦晋之好，用来泛指两家联姻。其典故，便出自秦穆公。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;秦国迁都雍城后的第二位国君为秦德公长子秦宣公，其时，秦国已在对西戎的战争中占据上风，下一步就是如何向东发展，与诸侯争夺天下。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;秦国地处西北边陲，它要向东发展，必须战胜的第一个敌人就是国境东面阻挡了秦国通往中原道路的晋国。但是，晋是一个实力雄厚的强国。秦宣公时，秦国与晋国第一次交手，秦国获胜，然而并无大用。到秦穆公时，穆公改变国策，向晋国求婚，娶了晋献公的女儿。此后，又扶持流亡的晋国公子重耳，帮助他做了晋君，并把女儿嫁给他——从亲戚关系上说，穆公先前是重耳的姐夫，后来又成了重耳的岳父。重耳即春秋五霸之一晋文公。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;晋文公死后，秦晋之好破裂，双方陷入长年战争。尽管秦国曾俘虏过晋惠公，但秦国东扩的步伐仍然被晋国遏制。惟一的重大成果是，晋惠公为了报答秦穆公的不杀之恩，把河西之地割与秦国。秦国第一次将势力推进到黄河西岸，秦人也第一次看到了浊浪滔天的黄河。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;秦穆公意识到秦国还无法彻底打败晋国，于是转而向今甘肃西部和陕北、宁夏一带的西戎发动攻势：“益国十二，开地千里，遂霸西戎”。秦穆公继小舅子加女婿晋文公后，成为春秋五霸之一。其时的秦国疆域，大致东到黄河，西达陇山以西，北到今平凉、延安一带，南抵秦岭，面积近10万平方公里，与晋国相当。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/2mrLbecwzDL45lt1h5nPxWtb7GNltAD33GvPCVjC.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/2mrLbecwzDL45lt1h5nPxWtb7GNltAD33GvPCVjC.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;泾阳地处西安以北，县城在泾水北岸。两年前，我到泾阳参观中国大地原点时，准备顺道寻访曾发生过影响秦国国运多年的麻隧之战旧址。但查阅方志并询问当地人后，却未能如愿——史书的记载太模糊：麻隧，泾阳县北。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《古文观止》中的《周文》里，收录了一篇《吕相绝秦》，此文便和麻隧之战有关：公元前577年，晋国派吕相出使秦国，历数秦穆公、康公、共公三代君主如何屡次背弃盟约，挑起战争，并向秦国宣战。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随后，晋国牵头组成包括晋、齐、宋、卫、鲁等在内的九国联军自东向西深入秦境，于麻隧激战。秦军大败，联军渡过泾河追到侯丽（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;今泾阳境内&lt;/span>;）才凯旋。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;麻隧之战是秦人历史上不多的惨败，秦穆公获取的河西之地被晋国夺走（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;三家分晋后归于魏&lt;/span>;）。失去了黄河天险，秦国国境向西大幅退缩，秦人东扩的理想遭遇迎头痛击。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;沉睡在一号大墓黄土深处的秦景公就是在麻隧之战丧师失地的大背景下登基就位的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;秦景公肯定感受到了秦国在国际上的极其孤立。为了扭转这种局面，他采取了与楚国结盟的办法——从根上说，楚人也是颛顼后裔，与秦、赵都有血缘关系。更重要的是，楚为子爵，比此时的秦还低，一向被中原诸侯以蛮夷视之。两个同被诸侯鄙视的国家一拍即合，结成秦楚联盟，对付晋齐为首的晋齐联盟。众多小国，只能在两大联盟之间走钢丝——当然，依附晋齐联盟的要多于依附秦楚联盟的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;麻隧之战18年后，在晋的牵头下，诸侯又一次组成联军攻秦——这一次多达13国。面对大军逼境，秦景公采取了有史可证的第一次“化学战”：当联军驻扎于泾河之滨时，他在上游投毒，大批联军将士中毒身亡，不得不退出秦境。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;秦景公任国君第31年，宋国大夫向戌搞了一个和平运动，史称向戌弭兵：包括秦、晋在内的14国结盟，停止战争，并奉晋、楚为共同霸主。秦、齐虽未问鼎霸主，但也与晋、楚同列为四大强国。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;转：栎阳城的惊世变法&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;我在公路旁的一块玉米地尽头找到了刻有“栎阳城遗址”的黑色石碑，石碑上方，是两根歪斜的电杆，电缆胡乱垂下来，像秋天里渐渐枯萎的藤蔓。其时，雨水淅沥，远近原野一片苍茫。我脑子里回想的，却是两千多年前发生在这里的匪夷所思的一幕：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;公元前359年，官府在栎阳城南门立了一根3丈长的木棍，并宣布：如果谁把木棍从南门扛到北门，赏10金。这么近的路，这么轻的工作，这么高的报酬？围观的人七嘴八舌地议论，却没人接招。一会儿，又加价了：50金。好半天，终于有人抱着试一试的态度，把木棍扛到北门――他果然得到了50金。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这典故，就是有名的徙木立信。在秦孝公大力支持下，商鞅主持的变法运动就这样在秦国首都栎阳拉开序幕。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/5BpJ7BzTnWGn09ctS1AvIHP1Gz6nFSANYiA9mYKt.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2020年年底，在西安阎良秦汉栎阳城遗址，考古人员第一次大面积发掘出了战国中期秦国宫城遗址内的后宫生活区。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC Photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;景公之后的十来代秦君，几乎都没有大作为，至多算守成之君。直到秦献公时代，秦国才又迎来新的崛起。秦景公是第十三代秦君，秦献公是第二十四代秦君，两者之间隔了整整两个世纪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;秦献公即位第二年，迁都栎阳。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;栎阳在今天西安东北的阎良区。从地理位置上说，它地处渭河以北，是关中平原通往三晋的必经之地，商业繁荣，人烟稠密。司马迁说它“东通三晋，亦多大贾”——仿佛是对栎阳商业发达的一个佐证，迁都栎阳几年后，秦献公“初行为市”——首次以官方形式开通集市，鼓励工商业，并抽取营业税。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;发展经济的同时，秦献公加强了对基层的控制，一方面进一步推行县制，另一方面把全国人口按每五家编为一伍，要求人民互相监督，实行连坐。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;秦献公二十一年（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;公元前364&lt;/span>;），秦军东渡黄河，深入魏国（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;前5世纪，三家分晋，晋国分裂为魏、赵、韩三国&lt;/span>;），在石门大败魏军，斩首6万。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;栎阳作为秦都只有三十多年，共计一代半国君——秦献公和他的儿子秦孝公。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;秦国崛起史上，秦孝公是一个举足轻重的关键人物。贾谊称：&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;“秦孝公据崤函之固，拥雍州之地，君臣固守以窥周室，有席卷天下，包举宇内，囊括四海之意，并吞八荒之心。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;秦孝公颇具自省精神，他认识到秦国僻处西北，在国际上没有话语权，诸侯会盟，秦国连参与的资格都没有，“诸侯卑秦，丑莫大焉”。于是，下令求贤；于是，商鞅来到秦国，启动了一系列改变历史的变法。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;商鞅变法的内容，司马迁用一句话作了概括：“变法修刑，内务耕稼，外劝战死之赏罚。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;要言之，商鞅变法最核心的就是两个字：农战。农是农业，战是军事。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;商鞅的成功，在于他抓住了问题的核心，那就是秦孝公希望用简单的、易于操作的、见效快的办法，像魔术师一样，变出一个生龙活虎的秦国。抓农业，让经济有了保障；抓军事，这在崇尚丛林法则的年代，是最硬的硬道理。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是，与变法修刑同步的，是严酷的连坐制和告密制——这一点，先后有几代秦君不断强化；与重农同步的，是对商的打击，即重农抑商。不仅商人要严厉打击，即便民众偶尔为之的商业活动，也在严禁之例；“外劝战死之赏罚”，固然使秦军更加勇敢，但秦国渐渐沦为一个嗜血的“尚首功”的国家：秦军每五人设一屯长，百人设一将。打仗时，百将和屯长如果没斩获敌人首级，统统处死。如果斩获首级33颗，达标，百将和屯长进爵一级。围攻敌方城市时，斩获首级8000颗以上，达标；在野战中斩获首级2000颗以上，达标；各级将领都可得到奖赏。依靠爵位来拉动和刺激的秦军，其疯狂嗜血显然不是诸侯能抵挡的。文明败给了野蛮，是因为野蛮可以藐视人间道德。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从今天的视角看，商鞅变法，固然可以使一个国家在短期内富强，但若把它作为长期国策，则注定将把国家引向灾难。比如一个重症病人，要想暂时挽救他的生命，可以用猛药；但长期用猛药，就不但不能治病，反而害命。 ——秦始皇时代，施行的仍然是当年的基本国策，它使秦国最终统一天下，却没能使秦朝逃过其兴也勃、其亡也忽的短命怪圈。究其因，就是商鞅变法这剂药过于生猛，一个正常国家，不可能承受得住这样的猛药。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;孝公去世后，商鞅遭到秦国贵族清算，处以车裂之刑，但由他制定的各项法令仍然在秦国忠实地执行。韩非子说：“商鞅死，秦法未败”。的确，商鞅本人虽惨死，但他当年制定的新法还在秦国沿袭，并为秦始皇统一中国打下坚实基础。其实，不仅商鞅的新法在秦国不灭，在旧中国历史上的其它时代，也随时可以见到商鞅的影子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;令人深思的是，秦国的崛起不仅没有改善秦国的国际形象，反而变得更加糟糕：商鞅变法前，秦国因偏僻闭塞，文化落后而被诸侯看作夷狄之邦；商鞅变法后，夷狄之邦的轻看外，还加上了贪利忘义、不讲诚信、暴戾凶残的骂名，诸侯把它称为暴秦或虎狼之秦。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一心一意做大做强的秦国君臣不屑于这些聒噪之音。此时的秦国，就像一辆已经发动的战车，正在轰隆隆地驶向疆场。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;合：六王毕，四海一&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;商鞅在栎阳轰轰烈烈变法的同时，还在栎阳西南两百里外的关中平原腹心地带打造另一座城市。那将是秦国未来的都城，也将是秦国以及由秦国升级换代而成的秦朝的终点——咸阳。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;西安绕城高速上有一座立交桥名为阿房宫，其内侧，便是阿房宫遗址。唐人杜牧的一篇《阿房宫赋》，使早已土崩瓦解多年的这座秦时宫殿名声显赫，几乎成了秦朝及其首都咸阳的代名词。然究其实质，阿房宫修筑于秦始皇三十五年，仅仅两年后，秦始皇就死在东巡路上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从栎阳迁到咸阳，秦国的都城和宫殿，建在距后来的阿房宫二十多里的地方——它们一个在渭河以北，一个在渭河以南。关于渭北，大约是杜甫那句“渭北春天树，江东日暮云”给我留下的美好印象，所以，当我在深秋里看到渭北的杨树叶落飘零时，未免有几分失望。咸阳秦都遗址坐落在一片辽阔的黄土塬上，登高凌远，两千年前的宫殿已化作耕地和树林，偶有一些突兀的台地，很可能就是当年的宫殿台基。台基下的黄土沟里，点缀着一些民居，几只羊在房前屋后的草丛中低头啃食，人间的沧海桑田不是这些可怜的牲口能够理解的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为秦国都城，自秦孝公至秦始皇，七代秦君在咸阳运筹帷幄，经过多年浴血奋战，终于九九归一；作为秦朝都城，自秦始皇至秦二世，仅仅十多年就一片瓦砾。秦始皇设想的是由始皇而二世而三世乃至千世万世，然而，理想很丰满，现实很骨感：从非子邑之秦到秦始皇统一中国，打天下耗费了嬴氏家族600多年，坐天下却只有区区14年。 600年的崛起与14年的崩溃，其原因，古人早就总结得十分透彻：“仁义不施而攻守之势异也。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;秦孝公将首都从栎阳迁往咸阳，最大因素在于咸阳地处秦国中心位置，且临近渭河，交通便利——顺着渭河，秦国的军队和物资可以进入黄河，从而向东征伐。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;迁都咸阳10年后，通过变法而兵强马壮的秦国磨刀霍霍。这一年，趁世仇魏国刚被齐国吊打，商鞅亲率大军渡河攻魏，并利用他与魏军主将之一公子卬的旧交，以会盟为名将其诱擒，大破魏军，收复了失去多年的河西之地，实现了秦孝公即位之初“复穆公之故地”的理想。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;秦孝公后，惠文王、武王、昭襄王、孝文王和庄襄王五任秦君次第登场，继续蚕食诸侯。其中，尤以惠文王和昭襄王为最：惠文王时，向东攻魏国，占领河西、上郡，黄河天险与崤函要塞牢牢控于秦人之手；向西南，灭巴国和蜀国；向西北，夺取义渠25城。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;昭襄王在位58年，是秦国享国最久的君主。他先后发动数十次征伐，其麾下战神白起仅仅四场战争就消灭诸侯军队100万以上——当时全天下的总人口，估计也不过2000万。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了对付秦国，诸侯以合纵为名组织了4次或5次联军，然而，正如贾谊说的那样：&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;“秦人开关延敌，九国之师，逡巡而不敢进。秦无亡矢遗镞之费，而天下诸侯已困矣。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/73oVHZiw76YNjTGCGgOBov7SXuO9V4FiLZLf1PTp.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;当嬴政成为新一代秦君时，还是一个13岁的青涩少年，大权掌握在吕不韦手中。公元前238年，23岁的嬴政来到雍城，举行加冕典礼。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上世纪80年代，考古工作者在凤翔县长青乡发现一处战国建筑遗迹，其中一块瓦当上有四个字：蕲年宫当。 “蕲”通“祈”，祈年，就是向上天祈求丰年。史料载，蕲年宫系穆公修建，嬴政的加冕礼便在这里举行——比加冕礼更重要的是，嬴政坐镇雍城，平定了在咸阳作乱的嫪毐。次年，赐死吕不韦，从此大权独揽，政令悉由己出。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;自公元前230年开始，秦国以摧枯拉朽之势发动了统一之战：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前230年，灭韩；&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前229年，灭赵；&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前225年，灭魏；&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前224年，灭楚；&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前222年，灭燕、代；&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前221年，灭齐。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;至此，九州肃清，海内混一。灼人的硝烟中，大秦王国升级为大秦帝国，秦王嬴政升级为秦始皇，一个疆域远迈前代的大一统帝国首次出现在中国。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;秦始皇下令没收天下兵器，把它们熔化后制成12座各重千石的金人（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;先秦时把铜称为金或吉金&lt;/span>;），高大的金人屹立于秦宫大门外，沐浴着从关中平原升起的血色朝阳。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;每消灭一个诸侯，秦始皇就下令将其宫殿按原样复建于渭水之滨，很快，“离宫别馆，相望于道，穷年忘归，犹不能遍”。当其它诸侯国的大多数城市都因连年战争几成废墟时，惟有咸阳独秀一枝，繁华与壮丽宛若神话。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以始皇自居的嬴政，有理由相信嬴氏江山必将万世一系，干戈永灭。由是，“独夫之心，日益骄固”。孰料，天意难问，他去世才3年，他和列祖列宗筚路蓝缕打下的万里江山竟灰飞烟灭，秦人和嬴氏，也在“天下苦秦久矣”的愤怒呐喊中走到尽头。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/BUAAaVGywg0OkSi1LVFI4tX3Kv2ZOZxPeqcbcX5B.jpeg&quot;

&quot;Jiangxi&quot; platform left a message, saying that he was riding an electric bicycle on the morning of September 14 and was hit by a police car. &quot;The perpetrator left without getting out of the car. Later, he called the police, was hospitalized, paid, and was discharged from the hospital. The perpetrator did not come forward.&quot; &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 26, the Fengcheng City Public Security Bureau Traffic Police Brigade responded on the platform that at about 8:50 on September 14, at the intersection of Jiefang South Road and Jianyi Avenue in Fengcheng City, the license plate number was The police car of GanC**** police collided with the complainant&#39;s unlicensed three-wheel electric vehicle, causing the complainant to be injured. On September 26, 2023, the brigade issued a traffic accident liability determination letter for the accident, and convened both parties to the accident for accident mediation on the complainant&#39;s personal injury compensation. The two parties reached an agreement, and the complainant expressed satisfaction with the result. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the netizen’s message, this was an ordinary traffic accident. However, keywords such as &quot;police car&quot;, &quot;driving away directly after the accident&quot; and &quot;did not show up for follow-up treatment&quot; as mentioned in the comments by netizens obviously gave the accident a different meaning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 70 of the Road Traffic Safety Law stipulates that when a traffic accident occurs on the road, the driver of the vehicle shall stop immediately to protect the scene; if personal injury or death is caused, the driver of the vehicle shall immediately rescue the injured person and promptly rescue the injured person. Report to the traffic police on duty or the traffic management department of the public security organ. If the police car causing the accident fails to perform these duties, or even leaves the scene directly after the accident, it will inevitably cause dissatisfaction and doubts among the victims. As law enforcers, you should have a higher awareness of law-abiding than ordinary people, instead of ignoring the safety of others. This not only damages the honor and image of the police, but also embodies a strong sense of privilege behind their actions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It should also be pointed out that the behavior of the police car was suspected of a traffic hit and run. According to Article 112 of the &quot;Regulations on Procedures for Handling Road Traffic Accidents&quot;: &quot;Traffic hit-and-run&quot; refers to the behavior of parties involved in a road traffic accident who, in order to evade legal liability, drive or abandon a vehicle to flee the scene of the road traffic accident or abscond and hide. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 31 this year, a court police car in Eryuan County, Yunnan Province left after a traffic accident. After the incident was exposed, it triggered heated discussions among netizens. According to a report from the Eryuan County Court, three people including Li Mouliang, a judicial police officer from the court, went to the Eryuan County Detention Center to perform official duties that day. During the meeting with a truck, they had a side scrape, causing varying degrees of damage to both vehicles. The Traffic Police Brigade of the Eryuan County Public Security Bureau issued the &quot;Road Traffic Accident Determination&quot; and &quot;Public Security Traffic Management Administrative Penalty Decision&quot;, confirming that Li Mouliang was fully responsible for the accident, and Li Mouliang&#39;s illegal behavior of escaping after the traffic accident did not constitute a crime. Administrative penalties include a fine of 1,000 yuan and 6 points on the driver&#39;s license. The court has criticized and educated Li Mouliang, ordered him to conduct a deep review, and will deal with him in accordance with relevant regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Fengcheng City police car hit a person and then left. Is his behavior considered a hit-and-run? When the police car left in a hurry, was it because of drunk driving? What kind of investigation did the Fengcheng City Traffic Police Department conduct on this matter, and how did it deal with the responsibilities of the police cars? From the response of Fengcheng City Traffic Police Department, we did not see this information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second doubt about the incident is that the traffic accident occurred on September 14, but the traffic accident liability certificate was not issued until the 26th. Article 62 of the &quot;Regulations on Procedures for Handling Road Traffic Accidents&quot; stipulates: The traffic management department of the public security organ shall prepare a road traffic accident determination letter within ten days from the date of on-site investigation. If inspection or appraisal is required, a road traffic accident determination certificate shall be produced within five days from the date of confirmation of the inspection report and appraisal opinion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the above regulations, if inspection, appraisal, etc. are involved, the issuance of the road traffic accident certification may be delayed because it requires a certain time limit. Then, the Fengcheng City Traffic Police Department should explain in detail whether the accident involved inspection or identification. If the above matters were not involved, why was it not until netizens exposed it that the traffic accident liability determination was issued? The Fengcheng City Traffic Police Department did not issue a traffic accident determination certificate on time in compliance with regulations. It is no wonder that many netizens questioned it. Some netizens even asked whether the &quot;leader&quot; was involved in the police car that caused the accident, which caused the delay in the accident liability determination? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Please don’t blame netizens for their rich associations. Regarding the incident of “police car hitting and injuring someone and then leaving directly”, the local traffic police department’s various deficiencies in the handling results are inconsistent with common sense and legal principles, and are inconsistent with the public’s understanding of this matter. There is also a clear gap in the expected information disclosure and fair processing. The police car at the scene and the belated traffic accident certificate should not remain a mystery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After all, in recent years, incidents involving one party claiming to have a &quot;background&quot; in traffic accidents and interfering with the handling of the traffic police department have occurred frequently. The more &quot;family members&quot; are involved, the stricter the public&#39;s scrutiny of such traffic accidents. They also expect the traffic police department to enforce the law impartially and the results can withstand the test of law and public opinion. The local traffic police department should respond to the above doubts that netizens are concerned about as soon as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 30 Sep 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[历史十字路口，普拉昌达如何建设“新尼泊尔”？丨智库视点]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257928]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-30 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/29/m24cPR1E5QwjQ4DMESUY6SH0SUBng6zSBqoEvnmA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;695&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/m24cPR1E5QwjQ4DMESUY6SH0SUBng6zSBq oEvnmA. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252811&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 21, 2023 local time, at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the United States, Prime Minister of Nepal Rachanda delivered a speech at the 78th session of the United Nations General Assembly. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From September 23 to 30, 2023, Nepalese Prime Minister Prachanda paid an official visit to China . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is Prachanda’s view on Nepal’s diplomacy, neighboring relations and the entire world situation? What is the connotation of the &quot;New Nepal&quot; vision proposed by Prachanda? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The answers to the above questions will be helpful for a comprehensive understanding of Prachanda’s ideological and political process in the past ten years, as well as the possible future political direction of Nepal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, the &quot;Selected Speeches of Prime Minister Prachanda of Nepal&quot; edited and translated by the Institute of South Asia of Sichuan University, a key research base of the Ministry of Education, will be published soon. The book includes Prachanda&#39;s speeches in 2015 —25 speeches in 2023 during his political career in the past ten years, answering the above questions. Most of the speeches included in the anthology cover Prachanda&#39;s speeches in the Nepali Parliament. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not only a commemoration of Prachanda’s visit to China, but also a testimony to the vigorous development of China-Nepal friendly relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Historical Transformations&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;What kind of Nepal does Prachanda want to build? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Prachanda has repeatedly praised the success of the Nepali people in their movement against the autocratic monarchy. He defined this shift as &quot;the largest shift in history&quot; &quot;heralding the last shift in a new era of peace, stability and prosperity&quot; and &quot;building history according to the needs of history.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a decade of civil war, Prachanda wants Nepal to go (or run) on the track of economic development and construction, hoping to end an era of chaos and poverty. His desire for development and prosperity made him a visionary leader. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When we stand at the crossroads of history and look back on the past, it is easy for us to be confused: whether Nepal has truly benefited from these historical achievements. For this reason, as the core political figure of this period, Prime Minister Prachanda has also been questioned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why has Nepal still not achieved the stability and prosperity it promised? Why are economic and social plans not implemented effectively? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some articles raised questions about Prime Minister Prachanda&#39;s previous commitments and vision. Because even after taking office several times, these promises and visions have not all been implemented. However, from the articles in this book that span a relatively long time, we may be able to see its original intention, practical helplessness, and future ambitions and plans. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Self-evident strategic position&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The geopolitical landscape of South Asia is changing. As the largest economy in the region, India adheres to the &quot;Monroe Doctrine&quot; and always tends to be brothers with its surrounding small economies. India regards South Asia as its own backyard, and no other country can get involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, as China is growing into a powerful country with widespread influence around the world, India is unable to compete with it and cannot continue to adhere to its policy stance in South Asia. Therefore, India agrees to the US presence in South Asia, which is imperative for the US to advance its long-term strategy of containing China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this context, Nepal&#39;s foreign policy is largely affected by the changing international situation. The United States very much wants Nepal to be part of its strategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1970s, the United States used Nepal to create border problems. Today, the United States is dictating to Nepal at all costs to force it to pass the Millennium Challenge Plan. U.S. officials came one after another to put pressure on Nepali leaders in Kathmandu and once again asked them to adopt the Military Operations Charter. From the implementation level of the US &quot;Indo-Pacific Strategy&quot;, a crucial point is to firmly control Nepal. The &quot;Millennium Challenge Plan&quot; and subsequent military plans are undoubtedly part of the United States&#39; &quot;Indo-Pacific Strategy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Modi government gave up its status as a founding member of the &quot;Non-Aligned Movement&quot; and joined the Western Alliance led by the United States. The situation in South Asia has changed. Therefore, even in Nepal, which advocates independence, the direction of diplomacy has been forced to change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, the United States mainly relied on India, or at least coordinated with Nepal and India in terms of policy. Today, the dominant position of the United States is very prominent and India&#39;s role has been weakened. This situation has deepened the contradictions and confusion among Nepali leadership. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although &quot;balanced foreign policy&quot; is the declared position of most Nepali leaders, they also tend to get stuck in the quagmire of great power politics. In this case, some of them are complacent about being included in the alliance backed by India and led by the United States. Therefore, the geopolitical competition between Nepal and South Asia is no longer just regional, but an important part of global geopolitics. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Balanced Diplomacy&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Maintaining diplomatic balance is the primary condition for Nepal&#39;s political stability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A series of diplomatic speeches made by Prachanda during his tenure as Prime Minister also mainly focused on trilateral cooperation with China and India. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the Shah dynasty (not just the Malla dynasty), Nepal has maintained a balanced relationship between its two giant neighbors, and it can maintain it as long as it maintains friendly relations with China and India. Safe and powerful. But sometimes, the different civilizations, different political systems, and different diplomatic positionings of the two neighboring countries can push Nepal into an uneasy situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tensions in Sino-Indian relations will put Nepal on the edge of vulnerability. It is important for Nepali politicians to master the art of maintaining a balance between the two poles. In a series of public speeches, Prachanda declared that &quot;the era of labeling as pro-India or pro-China is over&quot; and &quot;we are neither pro-China nor pro-India, we are pro-Nepal&quot; and insisted on turning Nepal into a communication channel The bridge between China and India. His &quot;pro-Nepal&quot; foreign policy is based on maintaining balance, mutual trust and friendly relations with both neighboring countries and all friendly countries. On this basis, the interconnection between countries is not only the infrastructure, but also the communication of ideas, markets and hearts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Nepal, it is crucial to maintain common and friendly relations with China and India. This is not only related to Nepal&#39;s prosperity, development and stability, but also related to Nepal&#39;s status as an independent and sovereign country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, there are two major obstacles hindering friendly relations between the three parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, the emergence of right-wing Hindu nationalist leadership in India and its pursuit of the West has obscured the friendly relations between the three neighboring countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, the paralysis of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and India&#39;s negative actions in the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) have opened the way for external powers to intervene in South Asian affairs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the context of changes in the global geopolitical landscape, the deeper concerns expressed by Western countries about Nepal cannot be ignored. For Western countries or any arrogant power, land is extremely important. No matter how big Nepal is, Western countries will spare no effort to include Nepal in their geopolitical alliances. As Professor Li Tao, the editor-in-chief of this book, said: &quot;As the United States intensifies its implementation of the &#39;Indo-Pacific Strategy&#39; and advances its strategic encirclement of our country&#39;s (China&#39;s) neighboring countries, Nepal&#39;s geostrategic status is self-evident.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;Every time the Prime Minister of Nepal takes office, he will continue the tradition of visiting two neighboring countries and demonstrate the good relations between Nepal and neighboring countries through this approach. Prachanda&#39;s visit to China with senior leaders of various countries during the Hangzhou Asian Games is not only a continuation of this diplomatic tradition, but also of great significance in expanding Nepal&#39;s international influence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Prachanda has long advocated that the three neighboring countries maintain peaceful and friendly relations, but the intervention of foreign powers has made this proposal not easy. The people of Nepal have never imagined that Nepal, the &quot;Land of Peace&quot;, would be forced to become a battleground between great powers. They believe that a strong desire for peace, development, prosperity and progress can play a key role in the struggle to prevent imperialism and power politics. effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historically, Nepal (especially the Kathmandu Valley) relied on northern trade as its economic basis, but due to geographical difficulties and weak infrastructure, northern border trade was greatly restricted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In today&#39;s era of rapid advancement in science and technology, these are no longer insurmountable obstacles. For the Chinese who grew up reading the story &quot;The Foolish Old Man Moves the Mountains&quot;, the mountains separating Nepal and China will never become an obstacle to the development of relations between the two countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Author: Niraj Lawoju, doctoral student at Sichuan University; Translator: Wang Jing, associate researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences)&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 30 Sep 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[洗小龙虾被扎手后离世，看完海鲜界隐藏的“杀手”我瑟瑟发抖]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257653]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-30 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/25/ad6c78c463628aa887a857a4ffa251c4.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;4642&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/09/25/ad6c78c463628aa887a857a4ffa251c4.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252080&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/ 25/a34dd0451df96cebb5e6aff7a03aeda4.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;4973&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/25/a34dd0451df96cebb5e6aff7a03aeda4.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252082&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/ c6df904d2b752b5d31dce3c0233e7a93.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;5405&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/ 25/c6df904d2b752b5d31dce3c0233e7a93.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252081&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 30 Sep 2023 13:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[被脱发缠住的年轻人：秃不秃头，并不妨碍爱与被爱]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257902]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-30 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/28/W2lqVDuCFgVGZ7i21WBM4N9BYYD20bXWeGQs28Eg.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/W2lqVDuCFgVGZ7i21WBM4N9BYYD20 bXWeGQs28Eg. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252661&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporters randomly interviewed many &quot;bald young men&quot; with pathological hair loss.

A large area of ​​scalp is exposed, and then spreads uncontrollably. The hair in other places begins to become soft and yellow. , in the end, the hair is like a mature dandelion, falling off with the slightest touch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;As long as you sit down for a while, you will find that there are fallen hairs on the chair, arms, and clothes.&quot; Greedy said. Eight years ago, 20-year-old Gretchen started her own business overseas. In the three months before the trial opening of the store, she was in a high-pressure state of mental stress and physical exhaustion every day. McDonald&#39;s at three in the morning became her most frequent restaurant. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hair loss is the trace left on her body by this day and night hard work. As a daily lingo among young people, &quot;bald-headed&quot; is not only a description of appearance, but also a state of exhaustion in work and life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;25-35 years old, male, working in the IT industry, these three labels delineate the target group of hair transplant customers that Wang Xiaoping, director of Damai Microneedle Hair Transplantation Technology Research Institute, has the most contact with. According to CCTV News, a survey on people with hair loss released by the National Health Commission showed that the number of people with hair loss in my country has exceeded 250 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The high pressure and fast pace of modern life have promoted the trend of younger hair loss from the environmental level. Taking common androgenic alopecia as an example, high mental stress, staying up late, and excessive exercise may all lead to Increased androgen levels will have a negative impact on hair follicles, leading to progressive miniaturization of hair follicles, which is manifested as hair gradually becoming thinner, softer or even falling off.&quot; Liu Yi, deputy chief physician at the Dermatology Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Stress and staying up late &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; are &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;directly reflected on the hair&quot; &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After 35 years old Having just joined a pharmaceutical company as a sales assistant, &quot;older newcomer&quot; Fan Fan felt that everything was too difficult. One person is responsible for various data statistics and administrative management of a sales team of more than 100 people. She works overtime until late at night every day. When she was infected with the new coronavirus for the first time, she only took less than a day&#39;s rest before continuing to work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fan Fan doesn’t dare to make mistakes, but no one is willing to spend time teaching him. The huge workload led to frequent mistakes, which often caused her to be stared at and scolded loudly. She did not dare to bring negative emotions to the workplace, &quot;for fear of being unemployed again at this age.&quot; In the end, all the anger was reserved for the family - &quot;I will yell at the child even if she calls her mother.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2023, 37-year-old Fan Fan decided to resign naked. Two months later, her hairdresser informed her that she had alopecia areata on the top of her head. &quot;Long-term bad mood, insomnia, panic, and gastroenteritis made me realize that I had a serious problem. I decided to resign under the pressure of difficulty in re-employment. However, I soon fell into the anxiety of being unemployed again. I didn&#39;t expect that I would be unemployed again. Encountered alopecia areata.&quot; Fan Fan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;China Alopecia Areata Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines (2019)&quot; issued by the Chinese Medical Association, alopecia areata is a hair follicle-specific autoimmune disease caused by the combined effect of genetic factors and environmental factors, which is manifested by the sudden onset of clear-cut borders on the scalp. circular patchy hair loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2010, scholars such as Guo Hongwei from the Department of Dermatology at the Southwest Hospital of the Third Military Medical University investigated the correlation between stressful life events and the risk of alopecia areata. The study showed that mental stress plays a significant role in the onset of alopecia areata. , sleep changes are the most dangerous factor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many &quot;bald young men&quot; who suffered from pathological hair loss randomly interviewed by Southern Weekend reporters all believed that staying up late, anxiety and chronic stress were important contributors to their hair loss. At a deeper level, it may be explained by the contemporary German philosopher Han Bingzhe&#39;s description of modern society as a &quot;merit society&quot; - people willingly fall into self-exploitation in a highly competitive environment and are exhausted in their efforts to realize their own value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhu Yu, who loves to play &quot;Honor of Kings&quot;, &quot;particularly cares about winning or losing the game.&quot; After losing, he always wants to wait until he wins before the game ends. He stays up until four or five in the morning to fall asleep almost every day; designer Jiao Jiao She often goes to bed at three o&#39;clock in the middle of the night. When interviewed by a Southern Weekend reporter, she could not fall asleep until five or six o&#39;clock in the morning for a month. Aric, a software engineer, encounters unsolvable problems at work and becomes anxious and nervous to the point of insomnia. According to his observation, nearly half of the programmers around him are suffering from hair loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When she suffered massive hair loss, 24-year-old Tian Luo was the store manager of a real estate agency store in Shanghai. Her daily working hours were from 9 a.m. to 1 a.m. the next day, with six days off and one day off. Even on her only day off, Tian Luo couldn&#39;t truly rest as she had to deal with customer complaints and other work at any time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the year of graduation, Tian Luo came to the &quot;dream Shanghai&quot; from Yunnan, won the first place in regional sales performance from scratch, and was promoted to manager in two years. But like countless young people who feel confused in their struggle, Tian Luo suddenly felt that she had lost her sensitivity to everything around her. &quot;I only had work, performance pressure and staying up late in my eyes, which were directly reflected in my hair.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;If I just met you&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; and I&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;are bald&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;, I&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;can’t choose you. As the other half&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The adolescence Chan Chan had shoulder-length hair. Since she started losing her hair, she has cut her hair shorter and shorter, keeping it above the chin all year round. She also lost 10 hairs, and long hair would visually cause a greater psychological burden on her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because of hair loss, the 1.65-meter-tall Grean Chan habitually walks at the highest point in the group. &quot;If you stand on the escalator first (when the elevator goes down) or stand on a lower step, and the people next to you can see the top of your head, I will try to stand behind you and stand higher than others.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;Medically, hair loss is usually divided into seven levels. Level 7 is the most severe severe hair loss, and Greedy was diagnosed with level 6. &quot;At that time, it was impossible to socialize at all. Whether I saw a rainbow, a shooting star, or any other occasion where I could make a wish, I would sincerely pray. My birthday wish every year is to make my hair grow back.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Severe Along with the hair loss came a diagnosis of depression and anxiety. In his early twenties, Greedy often thought: What is so precious about youth? I&#39;d better live to be fifty as soon as possible, so that when others my age start to go bald, I won&#39;t look different from others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ganchan and her boyfriend met in their freshman year. She was glad that her hair was not as thick as her scalp at that time. Although the other party never expressed concern about hair to Greedy, once, her boyfriend admitted, &quot;If you were like you are now (bald) when we first met, I really wouldn&#39;t be able to choose you as my other partner.&quot; half&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he is most emotionally depressed, Greedy will blame all his unsatisfactory life and work on his hair loss. Sometimes I quarrel with my boyfriend, and I can&#39;t help but think to myself, &quot;If I had hair and wasn&#39;t as ugly as I am now, maybe he wouldn&#39;t quarrel with me.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Mobius strip&quot; of interaction between body and mind may help us better understand the relationship between hair loss and stress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The diseases that negative emotions bring to the body are called psychosomatic diseases in the medical field - physical and organic diseases in which psychosocial factors play an important role in the onset and development. If the internal genetic factors causing hair loss are regarded as bullets, anxiety and internal friction are like triggers, which are important triggers that promote and aggravate the phenomenon of hair loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Physical illness in turn aggravates negative emotions, which can be called a physical and mental reaction, that is, physical illness becomes a psychological stressor and affects mental health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There is an interaction between physical health and mental health. This is because the human body’s nervous system, endocrine system and immune system interact with each other to jointly maintain the stability of the body’s internal environment. This interaction is a physiological and An important research area in the medical field is called the bio-psycho-social model. Many disfiguring skin diseases may cause patients to have anxiety, depression or self-esteem problems, which may lead to immune regulation disorders and further aggravate physical diseases.&quot; Liu Yi said . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A survey on anxiety and depression in patients with common psychosomatic skin diseases, published in &quot;Journal of Southeast University (Medical Edition)&quot;, showed that 17% of patients with skin diseases have psychological disorders that co-occur with their skin diseases. question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cui Shaofang, executive director and deputy CEO of Damai Hair Transplant Medical Group, told Southern Weekend reporters that the post-90s generation, who have become the main force in hair loss, often suffer from low self-esteem due to hair loss, which affects work and spouse selection. “Many people seeking hair transplant treatment The real desire of patients with hair loss is to build self-confidence, which prompts us to pay more attention to the mental health of people with hair loss.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;I&#39;m afraid that after I stop taking the medicine, &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;the hair that grew out before will also &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; fall out&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p >;September 24, 2023, is the 378th day that Lan Pingping insists on using minoxidil. In more than a year, she experienced three &quot;crazy hair loss periods&quot;. Each time she washed her hair, she lost one to two hundred strands, which lasted about 20 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After long-term use of minoxidil, Lan Pingping found that her whole body had become hirsutious, and her scalp also had acne from time to time, but she never thought about stopping. The hair that came out also fell out.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In interviews with reporters from Southern Weekend, almost all hair loss patients admitted that they have used common anti-hair loss products on the market, including but not limited to anti-hair loss shampoos, laser hair growth caps, scalp essences, massage combs, and five-part anti-hair loss products. Black powder, black sesame balls, etc. Among them, the most commonly mentioned is minoxidil hair growth solution administered as an over-the-counter drug. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Minoxidil was originally a drug used to treat high blood pressure, but was accidentally discovered to promote hair growth. Liu Yi believes that there is some abuse of minoxidil due to promotion by e-commerce platforms and self-media. Although minoxidil is relatively safe, it may also cause some side effects, such as local allergies or irritation reactions, hirsutism, etc., and in a few cases, it may even cause a drop in blood pressure, tachycardia, etc. Therefore, its application is best carried out under the guidance of a doctor to avoid abuse and overdose to ensure safety and effectiveness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;First, minoxidil is a therapeutic drug, and it is not necessary to use it for the purpose of preventing hair loss when hair loss does not occur; second, although androgenic alopecia is the main cause of hair loss, Causes, but telogen effluvium, alopecia areata, etc. are also very common, and some patients may be accompanied by other underlying diseases, so the type of hair loss should be judged by a doctor before treatment. For example, diffuse alopecia areata, the clinical manifestations can be similar to androgenic alopecia, but used alone Minoxidil is usually not very effective,&quot; Liu Yi said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a long illness, Greanman often reads research papers in the field of hair loss and thinks he has tried almost every anti-hair loss product on the market. She has bought five to six thousand yuan of supplements from domestic micro-businessmen that claim to &quot;radically cure hair loss&quot;, and has also spent 10,000 yuan to buy imported 650 nanometer laser hair caps. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In her opinion, some high-priced products actually have low raw materials and are just an &quot;IQ tax&quot; labeled &quot;anti-hair loss&quot;. Most products have limited help in hair growth, and it is difficult to produce visible hair loss when used alone. Visible hair growth effects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Cosmetics Supervision and Administration Regulations&quot; that will be implemented in 2021, the original hair growth cosmetics category will be cancelled. Hair growth cosmetics that have obtained the &quot;National Cosmetic Special Label&quot; in the past will be classified as &quot;hair growth cosmetics&quot; after a five-year transition period. Stop production and sales. Newly added anti-hair loss cosmetics are registered and managed as &quot;special purpose cosmetics&quot; and require efficacy testing at a cosmetics administrative licensing inspection agency. They can be produced and sold only after approval by the State Food and Drug Administration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Yi believes that the popularity of anti-hair loss products shows that the current hair loss problem still faces huge unmet clinical needs. &quot;For androgenic alopecia, the most common type of hair loss, currently only two drugs, finasteride and minoxidil, are approved for treatment in China. However, some patients have poor efficacy, coupled with safety concerns and other factors, Therefore, there is a demand for alternative methods in the market.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Build your own combination boxing&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2021, Greedy decided to finally fight for Shengfa She tried her best once, and if she failed again, she decided to let herself go. &quot;I can&#39;t continue to struggle in the whirlpool of hair loss. Even if I have no hair and wear a wig all my life, I still want to be a happy little girl.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gantan listed the experience he gained from seeking medical treatment for seven years, and created a set of &quot;hair growth combination boxing&quot; methods that cover washing and care steps, medication combination, dietary structure, and work and rest adjustments. Looking back, Greedy thinks that was the moment when &quot;the gears of his destiny began to turn.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;When I completely relaxed my mood, adjusted my lifestyle, and followed my DIY method for two months, my scalp began to be covered with new hair, and my hair grew back again.&quot; Speaking of this &quot;Miracle&quot;, Greedy still finds it incredible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this set of combos, Greedy insists on completing at least two of the three things &quot;eat well, sleep well, feel good&quot; every day. She made a video of her experience and shared it on the Internet, which received tens of thousands of likes. Greanman discovered that she was not the only one suffering from hair loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, once alopecia is diagnosed, it is likely that you will need to fight it for life. Waiting for the emergence of new technologies and reconciling with oneself have become life issues for &quot;bald young people&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fu Hongbo, a 22-year-old senior in college, was diagnosed with androgenic alopecia. After using minoxidil for nearly a year with no obvious results, he chose to go to a hair transplant institution for forehead transplantation. To his surprise, the forehead after hair transplantation was still visibly sparse, accompanied by a large amount of shedding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tu Ming, dean of Yonghe’s hair transplant business, told Southern Weekend reporters that the principle of hair transplantation is to transplant healthy hair follicles from the occipital area of ​​the body to areas with sparse hair. It is mainly used in androgenic alopecia. With current technical means, androgenic alopecia cannot be cured. Therefore, hair transplantation can improve the current aesthetic problem, but it does not mean that hair loss can be stopped after hair transplantation. Controlling hair loss to a more satisfactory level requires long-term medication and maintenance. treat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the slightly M-angled hairline of his newborn son, Aric worried that his M-shaped hair loss would be passed on to the next generation. Fu Hongbo&#39;s way of explaining his explanation is &quot;I believe in the development of science and technology. Maybe hair follicle cloning technology will appear in a few years to completely solve this problem.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The medical community never stops working hard. In June 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Pfizer&#39;s new drug Ritlecitinib for the treatment of alopecia areata in adolescents and adults aged 12 years and older. Ritexitinib becomes the first drug approved to treat adolescents with alopecia areata. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Compared with baricitinib, the first treatment for severe alopecia areata in adults approved in China, ritexitinib has a stronger targeting effect on the autoimmune inflammatory pathways related to alopecia areata. It is safer and more effective, bringing new breakthroughs in the treatment of alopecia areata,&quot; Liu Yi said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, Greedy is a &quot;hair growth blogger&quot; with 100,000 followers on social media. There are always people leaving private messages, asking her to recommend a product that is most helpful for hair growth. Gretchen replies over and over again: &quot;Don&#39;t believe that any product can cure your hair loss. The only way is to start by changing your lifestyle.&quot; , build your own combination punch.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a brand manager engaged in marketing and product development, Mei Lan was diagnosed with diffuse alopecia areata in June 2022. After experiencing hair loss for half a year, Mei Lan seemed to have been reborn. &quot;No matter how busy you are at work, you still have to exercise every day. People always have to give themselves some space. When life is no longer limited to one branch, I naturally no longer care about the gains and losses on this road, because I will have many branches.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;It is not easy to make peace with yourself and hair loss. Her hair is like a greedy experimental field. She keeps sowing seeds on it. Sometimes the harvest is poor and sometimes it is abundant. Even if she has a set of &quot;combination punches&quot; to deal with it, sometimes a mood swing is enough to destroy all the hard work and she has to start from scratch. came. But the good news is that as long as you continue to maintain a good attitude and living habits, everything will happily get better. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Glutton never broke up with her boyfriend of nine years.

The occurrence of sudden death is unexpected and cannot be predicted in most cases. This is why sudden death is the most terrible disease in the world. Clinically, sudden death can be divided into two categories, namely sudden cardiac death and non-cardiac sudden death. Among all patients who die suddenly, 75% are caused by heart disease, the most common cause of which is coronary heart disease; about 25% are caused by non-cardiac diseases (i.e., the patient has causes other than the heart). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In order to facilitate understanding, I divide it into internal causes and external causes. The internal cause is the premature aging of the body&#39;s own functions, weakening the ability to decompose and eliminate metabolic waste and toxins entering the body and produced by the body itself, resulting in abnormal body metabolism, increased blood lipids, blood sugar, and uric acid, and excessive accumulation of fat in the internal organs, blood, and subcutaneous tissue. Formation of atherosclerotic plaques (fatty plaques that line the walls of arteries). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Once these plaques rupture, they will immediately stimulate coagulation function in the corresponding blood vessels, forming thrombus almost instantly. If a certain branch of the heart blood vessel is blocked, Sudden death will occur if the heart is suddenly ischemic. Therefore, maintaining a youthful state of the body and improving the normal functions of various organ systems in the body are fundamental to prevention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;External factors refer to various factors outside the body and attached to the body, which lead to the deterioration of physical conditions. This is all too common in the workplace: the glamorous appearance cannot conceal the tiredness caused by working overtime and staying up late, the pressure from bosses, superiors and project progress, open and secret fights between peers and colleagues, commuting to and from work, squeezing in elevators, subways, heavy traffic jams, and lack of sleep. , irregular diet, having to socialize with each other, lack of exercise, supporting a family, and all kinds of consumption for the sake of face...&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;All of these are overdrafting your body , making the already disordered hormone secretion and metabolic system in your body even more overwhelmed, exacerbating the possibility of tragedy. That is to say, insufficient rest, insufficient and extremely unbalanced nutrients, and long-term mental stress, resulting in the body being unable to repair and improve itself normally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, the most fundamental thing is that your heart function is already in a bad state, but you don&#39;t know it at all. Coupled with the above-mentioned workplace pressures, the chance of sudden death greatly increases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/Hl2cmWoPON0F3tUJkXGtlvba93yX5nhFYxqhQTdi.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/Hl2cmWoPON0F3tUJkXGtlvba93yX5nhFYxqhQTdi.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252840&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;You can’t just resign and quit, right? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some people say that my working status is like this, I can’t resign, right? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, for some people, resigning may be a good idea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, if you have to stick to this job in order to support your family, try to make the following adjustments, which will not only prevent sudden death, but more importantly It can make up for your overdrafted health and live a healthy life for yourself and your family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;1. First go to a regular hospital and ask a responsible doctor to do a comprehensive physical examination (especially to check for hidden cardiovascular diseases). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2. Scientific diet and balanced nutrition: A reasonable dietary structure means that the nutrients contained in the diet are complete in variety, sufficient in quantity, and in appropriate proportions to satisfy both needs and requirements. It can meet the physiological needs of the body and avoid imbalances in the proportion of nutrients in the diet (or even nutritional disorders caused by lack or excess of certain nutrients). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is best to have three meals a day: a. Vegetables and fruits: more varieties are better, mainly supplementing vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, etc., every day The number of meals should be at least equivalent to the size of one&#39;s own fist; b. Protein foods: mainly supplement various amino acids, trace elements, vitamins, etc. necessary for the human body, including meat proteins (such as seafood, chicken, duck, and fish meat), each meal The quantity is equivalent to the size of your palm minus your fingers) and non-meat proteins (eggs, milk, soy products, etc., the quantity of each meal is equivalent to the size of your fist); c. Grain and starch foods: various rice and flour products, potatoes Categories, corn, etc., mainly supplement starch (sugar), vitamins, dietary fiber, etc. The amount of each meal is equivalent to the size of your own fist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, according to a random survey of more than 10,000 people by relevant research institutions in the United States, the vast majority of people are unable to achieve truly balanced nutrition through diet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;3. Adhere to scientific and reasonable exercise: According to the results of the physical examination, combined with physical condition and time, carry out step-by-step exercise (you can practice by yourself, or you can go to the gym to do it) Personal training depends on your own hobbies and level of wealth). However, no matter where you exercise, the so-called aerobic exercise (such as running, swimming, cycling, etc.) and anaerobic exercise (mainly strength exercise) must be closely integrated and indispensable, and must reach a certain intensity. Only then will your exercise have a real effect on improving physical function. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;4. Develop good living habits: Try not to stay up late. You may not feel the harm once or twice occasionally. Staying up late for a long time is overdrafting your health. . Adequate and high-quality sleep is a necessary means for the body to repair itself and regulate its functions. Overdraft without actively replenishing it is like a mobile phone battery that has been depleted but not recharged in time. The final result can be imagined. As for the harm that heavy drinking (whether short-term or long-term habitual) does to the body, even if I don’t say it, most people will understand it! &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;5. Emotional management: Although it is difficult to control emotions in a busy working environment, remember not to let yourself be overjoyed or sad. This is meaningful to ensure that you can live a healthy and safe life and maintain a harmonious family and society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;6. Supplement safe and effective health products: If you accept the basic common sense that the human body is composed of substances, you should understand that without an adequate material basis, the functions will not be sufficient. How much better would it be. Theoretically, all injuries in the human body can be cured through its own repair. The basic raw materials for repair are nutrients such as protein, lipids, sugars, vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber and water. However, the reality is that today’s food can no longer provide adequate and balanced nutrition to the body. Therefore, it is not a question of whether to take health supplements or not, but that you have to take health supplements for your health. Everyone&#39;s nutritional deficiencies exist objectively, but the degree of deficiency is different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;7. Appropriate drug intervention for discovered diseases: However, drugs only target symptoms, they are not the fundamental factor in solving the problem. The contribution of medical intervention to human health only accounts for about 10%, and the rest is the result of the above comprehensive factors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;I found someone suspected of sudden death, what should I do? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What should you do if you find someone suspected of sudden death? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;First, identify cardiac arrest and call 120 emergency services. Second, take cardiopulmonary resuscitation measures quickly. I won’t go into details about the specific steps. The principle is to check breathing and heartbeat, and clear the airway, and then perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation mainly with chest compressions (if it is a sudden cardiac arrest). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The compression position is in the middle left of the sternum (most people&#39;s heart is in the left chest), 100 to 120 times per minute, and the depth is 5 to 6 centimeters. The key is to continue compressions until professional rescuers arrive. Third, implement defibrillation as soon as possible. For sudden cardiac arrest, the most effective first aid method is electric defibrillation. If it is done one minute earlier, the patient&#39;s hope of survival will increase by 10%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 30 Sep 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中国男篮亚运两连胜，球员坦言球队仍需成长适应大赛强度]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257936]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-30 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 28, 2023, Chinese team player Zhang Zhenlin broke through Chinese Taipei under the basket The player defends and shoots the basket.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/48085416cd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/48085416cd.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252832&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 28, 2023, Chinese team player Zhang Zhenlin broke through the defense of Chinese Taipei team players under the basket and shot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 28, 2023, in the Asian Games Basketball Men’s Preliminary Group B match at the Hangzhou Olympic Sports Center Gymnasium, the Chinese team ushered in the first place in the group stage.

Liang Gewen, the former Secretary of the Qingyuan Municipal Party Committee, mentioned it again. The &quot;Qingyuan Experience&quot; evolved from the 5 yuan reward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Qingyuan Experience&quot; was an attempt by Qingyuan to expand enterprise autonomy and mobilize workers&#39; enthusiasm at the beginning of reform and opening up, and pioneered the reform of state-owned enterprises in Guangdong. Over the past 45 years, the &quot;Qingyuan Experience&quot; advocating &quot;dare to be the first&quot; has continued to play different roles in various historical periods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to Liang Gewen, the event also invited Deng Sai from the Party Building Office of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of Guangdong Province and Lu Guowei, member of the Party Branch of Lianzhang Village, Lianjiangkou Town, Yingde City. The three of them witnessed different stages of reform and opening up. . Deng Sai was one of the first batch of civil servants recruited openly when the Provincial State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission was established in 2004. He has deep feelings about the reform of state-owned enterprises in the past two decades. Lu Guowei shared the great changes in Lianzhang Village in the past five years from the perspective of a grassroots poverty alleviation cadre. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the event, the 80-year-old Liang Gewen always emphasized that today we still need to emancipate our minds and boldly innovate. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;More work, more rewards, turn losses into profits&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 1978, on the eve of reform and opening up, Qingyuan began to implement the &quot;exceeding plan profit commission bonus&quot; reform . Liang Gewen, then the press secretary of the Qingyuan County Party Committee, was 35 years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liang Gewen has a deep understanding of Qingyuan’s traffic. Qingyuan is located in the mountainous area of ​​northern Guangdong and has inconvenient transportation. At that time, there was no road from Qingyuan to Guangzhou, so one had to cross the river by boat and then take a bumpy car. Liang Gewen went to Guangzhou to deliver articles to newspapers. Riding a motorcycle was faster than a car. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The geographical location led to Qingyuan&#39;s economic backwardness to a certain extent. Its economic aggregate and fiscal revenue basically ranked at the bottom of the province at that time. In 1977, Qingyuan failed to complete the profit plan issued by the state and suffered a loss of more than 300,000 yuan. Some companies even needed to borrow money from the local government to pay workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because workers eat from a big pot, it doesn’t make much difference whether they work more or less. Qingyuan’s largest state-owned nitrogen fertilizer factory at the time faced the problem of workers being passive and slow in working. The nitrogen fertilizer plant, which was put into operation in 1970, was the largest factory with the most workers in Qingyuan at that time. However, the annual output of a medium-sized fertilizer factory with more than 400 people was only more than 5,000 tons at its peak. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Output cannot increase, and the factory has been losing money year after year. According to factory employees, when farmers queued up to buy fertilizer, some people started fighting over it. &quot;If fertilizers cannot keep up, food production will be reduced, and farmers will have to look for fertilizers everywhere.&quot; Liang Gewen said. During the busy farming season of July and August every year, the county party committee secretary would come to the factory to supervise production. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The turning point occurred in October 1978. A policy called &quot;Super Planned Profit Commission Award&quot; was first piloted at Qingyuan Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before this reform, there was an accident in the factory. A worker accidentally closed the wrong valve of a gas tank, causing the gas tank to become severely deformed. According to past experience, it takes three months to repair. In order to meet the construction deadline, the factory leaders summoned technical personnel from all over Qingyuan and promised that whoever could repair the equipment and resume production in advance would be rewarded 5 yuan. In the end, it only took 10 days to complete the task. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is the concept of 5 yuan? At that time, workers&#39; monthly salary was 33 yuan. In order to support their families, many workers go to the mountains to cut firewood, go down to the rivers to catch fish, and fish for snails in the fields after get off work to increase their income. &quot;Five yuan can buy eight pounds of pork. At that time, the target was half a pound of pork per person per month.&quot; Liang Gewen said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This incident made the factory leaders realize that incentives can be used to mobilize motivation. In the atmosphere of great discussion on the issue of truth standards, the nitrogen fertilizer plant also held a discussion meeting. An agreement was reached at the meeting to improve everyone&#39;s enthusiasm through reforming the reward system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since October 1978, the county party committee began to pilot the &quot;exceeding plan profit commission award&quot; in four plants including the nitrogen fertilizer plant. &quot;For example, if we plan to hand over 1 million yuan in profits, if the annual profit is 1.5 million yuan, we will take part of the 500,000 yuan and distribute it to the workers.&quot; Liang Gewen explained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the mechanism of more reward for more work, the efficiency of the factory has been significantly improved. After 18 days of trial operation, a profit of 35,000 yuan was achieved in the month. This was also the first month to achieve profit in nine years of production. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Opposition&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Reform is not without opposition. Some departments in the county consider this to be a &quot;private division of state property.&quot; Fortunately, with the support of county leaders, it was implemented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reform of the nitrogen fertilizer plant has even attracted the attention of the Guangdong Provincial Government. But the opinions in the province are not unified. In May 1979, the finance and labor departments of Guangdong Province jointly issued a document requiring Qingyuan County to stop implementing the &quot;exceeding plan profit commission award.&quot; The reason is that there is a lack of documentary evidence and the commission ratio is too large. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three months later, at the group discussion of the Guangdong Provincial Industrial Transportation Production Increase and Conservation Conference, the debate on the &quot;Qingyuan Experience&quot; was settled. The meeting decided to promote Qingyuan’s “Exceeding Plan Profit Commission Award” to county-owned industrial enterprises across Guangdong Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth mentioning that since turning losses into profits in 1979, the nitrogen fertilizer plant has achieved profits every year. By 1989, it had achieved a total profit of nearly 10 million yuan for 11 consecutive years. In the years that followed, Liang Gewen was often asked about the impact of the &quot;Qingyuan Experience&quot; on Guangdong. His answer was simple - the most important thing was that the cadres and masses of the nitrogen fertilizer plant dared to be the first and boldly innovated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The courage to be the first and bold innovation in the &quot;Qingyuan Experience&quot; have also taken root in the reform of state-owned enterprises in Guangdong Province. According to Deng Sai, since the three-year action of state-owned enterprise reform was launched in 2020, &quot;Guangdong&#39;s state-owned economic layout structure has also undergone major changes, and state-owned capital has become more concentrated in important industries and key areas related to the national economy and people&#39;s livelihood.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is understood that as of the end of 2022, the total assets of local state-owned assets supervision enterprises in Guangdong Province reached 16.27 trillion yuan, ranking third among local supervision enterprises in the country. In 2022, the operating income and profits of local state-owned assets supervision enterprises in the province The total amount ranked third and second in the country respectively. Among the province&#39;s local state-owned assets supervision enterprises, 6 have entered the Fortune Global 500. &quot;This means that Guangdong&#39;s state-owned economy continues to grow in scale and strength, and is promoting the sustained and healthy development of the national economy.&quot; Deng Sai said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lianzhang Village, located in the northeast of Qingyuan City, is experiencing the &quot;Qingyuan Experience&quot; in the new era. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Born in 1993, Lu Guowei is a native of Lianzhang Village. He often hears people mention the story of the reform of the nitrogen fertilizer plant. In 2017, Lu Guowei returned to his hometown and became a grassroots poverty alleviation cadre. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Guowei remembers that when he was a child, Lianzhang Village was one of the poorest villages in Lianjiangkou Town. The village was surrounded by mountains and only connected to the outside world by a rugged road. The village&#39;s pillar industry was Sugar orange. &quot;Except for a small amount of rice, peanuts, and corn, every household grows sugar oranges,&quot; Lu Guowei said. In 2011, affected by Huanglongbing, almost all the sugar orange trees in the village were wiped out.

Every November, the southwest monsoon and ocean currents blow through southern India, southern Arabia and the coast of Somalia, to San Island, and then further south to the Comoros Islands and Madagascar. Before tourism became the main industry of Sand Island, the vast majority of people in Stone Town relied on the sea for their livelihood, including fishermen, sailors and merchants who came and went with the wind. At one time, there were dangerous merchants who sold ivory, spices and slaves. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In today&#39;s Stone City, various houses of different sizes are dotted along the entire coastline. Many are Islamic-style buildings, and a few are decorated with complicated European patterns. It has been converted into post offices, office buildings, cafes, restaurants and private residences, among which there are many simple shabby iron shacks owned by local fishermen. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At the beginning of 2019, I came to Stone City for the third time. Taking advantage of the New Year holiday, I wandered around for nearly a week, looking at the remains of the ancient shell city wall seven or eight centuries ago.

It was hidden, but it was empty inside. It is not clear whether the house is for private or public use. Walking around the alley next to the house to the backyard, you can see a group of little boys wearing robes and square hats. They are squatting and playing with marbles and soda bottle caps. On the other side of the yard, there were several men leaning against the wall. They crossed their arms and talked about the rainy season, the wind direction and the lowest price for buying lilacs. Behind them were several women who set up small stalls selling fruits and vegetables. They seemed to be selling scattered dried fish, cherry tomatoes and onions. In fact, they were more interested in chatting. It didn&#39;t matter whether the things could be sold or not. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The sun was setting at that time, and the light shone just right in the yard and on the roof, and finally briefly settled on the sweaty brows and cheeks of men, women, old and young. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After walking out of the yard, I went to a cafe across the street, ordered a cup of Americano with clove flavor, and pulled out an old book from the bookshelf. The book is called &quot;Eye of Cloves&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(&quot;Eye of Cloves&quot;, F.D. Omani)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, published in 1955. When I opened it, I didn&#39;t have any expectations, it was just to kill time. Sand Island is called the &quot;Lilac Island&quot;, so judging from this title, it is not much different from most travel books about Sand Island. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;I flipped through the pages of the book until I saw an old black and white photo. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Isn’t that square house and yard in the photo the same place I just passed by? More than fifty years have passed, and nothing seems to have changed. It seems that even people&#39;s status and clothing have been frozen at that moment. The adults sit or stand bored, and the children run or jump carefree. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The caption of the photo reads: Arab residential area. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This description can be used to summarize almost any neighborhood I passed through today, but to put it more accurately, most of the neighborhoods can be called &quot;Indian Arab Swahili&quot; Xili Mixed Residential Area&quot;. Because in today&#39;s Stone City, the vast majority of locals are accustomed to interracial trade, mixing, and intermarriage. It is difficult to accurately identify whether a person is of Arab, Indian, Southeast Asian, or Sri Lankan descent just by looking at his skin color and dress. With Vasili ancestry or a mixture of two or even three of them, almost everyone became a &quot;Zanzibar&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/b916a255dac148c595805f20cc1d0b79.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/b916a255dac148c595805f20cc1d0b79.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;169420&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;Overlooking Stone City/Visual China&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span >;In 2015, Gurner mentioned this residential area in a lecture at the University of Kent where he teaches. He was born and grew up in Stone Town, an area generally known as the &quot;Arab residential area.&quot; He projected a related black-and-white photo in class. The photo showed a small square house with a simple two-story building standing on the left. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote data-type=&quot;2&quot; data-url=&quot;&quot; data-author-name=&quot;&quot; data-content-utf8-length=&quot;98&quot; data-source-title=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;p>;&quot;I was born in the small building on the left. When I was a child, we always stood on the terrace on the second floor and watched the sailing ships leaving the port or returning from the sea, one after another, loaded with various goods. If you go downstairs and pass through the courtyard downstairs, you will see a workplace, a warehouse, and a vegetable market behind it.&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;blockquote data-type=&quot;2&quot; data-url= &quot;&quot; data-author-name=&quot;&quot; data-content-utf8-length=&quot;244&quot; data-source-title=&quot;&quot;>; &lt;p>;But what you can’t see from the photo is what kind of person he is. Live in this place. If you could see them, you might feel helpless like me. Why? Because when the outside world talks about us and this place, they will always savagely describe it as The complexity and richness are summed up in these seven colorless words (referring to the &quot;Arab residential area&quot;)... But in fact, in the house at the back, there lived an Indian family; next to them, lived The president of the Lilac Planting Association is an Englishman; the house on the far side is the local police station, and the chief is a San Island native of Somali descent; behind the police station is a cafe run by a Yemeni businessman... But According to convention, this is only an Arab residential area.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Gulna described all this calmly to the thoughtful college students in the audience, except for the slightly wrinkled Meifeng, no emotion can be seen. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;I think of that photo taken in 1955. Gurna was only about 7 years old that year. Maybe he was among the group of children playing in the background of the photo. From that time until he left home at the age of 18, it was a decade of great change in the history of Sang Island. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/5da0c2c9b6ad5aaebca8654dfef6c27c.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/5da0c2c9b6ad5aaebca8654dfef6c27c.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;169421&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A man draws characteristic tingatinga paintings and sells them to tourists/ICphoto&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1964, Mulberry Island Revolution&lt;/h3>; &lt; p>;&lt;span>;In &quot;Lilac Eyes&quot;, I also turned to another dated black and white photo. Its caption read: European residential area - although the large Arab-style flat-roofed building in the photo looks There is nothing &quot;European&quot; about it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The next day, I found out the specific location of the building. After arriving, I discovered that the building complex was built one after another by Arab merchants two to three centuries ago. In the 19th century, the British became more and more active on Sand Island. Until the end of the 19th century, Sand Island became a British protectorate and this area was officially occupied by the British. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 1872, Richard Belden published two issues of his travel diary about Zan Island, &quot;Zanzibar: City, Island and Seaside&quot;, and many subsequent comments They all thought that he might want to use this to hint that European readers had begun to explore the source of the Nile in 1856, much earlier than Livingston. But surprisingly, the influence of this diary is more evident in his inadvertent description of the slave trading system on Sand Island, which reminds people that the slave trade in East Africa is no less rampant than in West Africa. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As a meeting place for Arabs, Indians, Europeans and Africans, San Island is like a corridor connecting various rooms and halls, and at the same time provides sweet dates from the Arab region. Plantations, the tea fields of India, and the sugar industry of Southeast Asia&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(even the Americas)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; provided labor. The most miserable ones were the male slaves who were selected as eunuchs by the Ottoman Empire. Because of the unhygienic conditions of castration, usually only one in ten could survive. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Belden mentioned: Investigations show that before 1897, when the British used both carrot and stick to ask the Sultan who was in power at that time to abolish slavery, two-thirds of the people on Sand Island were of the population belonged to the slave class. Still, Belden wrote, it was difficult for him to differentiate between black and brown people and what their ancestry was. &quot;Swahili, Persian&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(later developed into the &quot;Shiraz ethnic group&quot;)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, Arabia and India...all mixed together , I feel that the people here&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(referring to Sang Island)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; are simply like a brand new race.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/span>; p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 1890, the British officially took over Sand Island, but did not provide any effective and constructive mechanism for sustainable development. Land, wealth and power are still highly concentrated in Asia&lt;/span>;&lt;span style =&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(Including Arabia)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;In the hands of the merchant class. At the same time, as was the practice in many other colonial powers, the rulers adopted a rigid management method in Sand Island by classifying all civilians according to their ethnicity and forcing them into a certain ethnic identity group. This made the tension inherent in the complex and subtle multi-racial mixture of Mulberry Island suddenly become tense. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Until the 1950s, a political storm against colonial rule swept across Africa. In 1963, Sand Island declared independence from the United Kingdom, the new Sudan succeeded to the throne, and British forces hurriedly withdrew from Sand Island. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Two days after leaving the &quot;European residential area&quot;, I came to the outskirts of Stone City and stayed at a B&amp;B recommended by a friend. &quot;Chat with the boss, you I&#39;ll be interested.&quot; My friend told me with a wink. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Wilson, the owner of the B&amp;B, is a Tanzanian, British-Indian, 70-year-old man. He was born and raised on Sand Island until he was 6 years old, and then moved to Sang Island with his parents. Dar es Salaam&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(Tanzania&#39;s largest city)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;until the age of 20, then went to Edinburgh to attend university for four years. anthropology. After graduation, he changed three or four teaching jobs. &quot;I felt like I couldn&#39;t find a sense of belonging no matter how much I stayed in Europe,&quot; so he returned to East Africa. At first he wanted to take root on San Island again, but before he could settle down, he encountered the 1964 revolution. He had to take his Indian wife and three children and flee to Nairobi and Mombasa on the coast of Kenya, where he lived for more than ten years. Then we moved to the evergreen town of Mosh at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. It was not until 2005 that he returned to Sang Island and has settled there ever since. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;I found Wilson and sat with him among the coconut trees in the evening breeze, drinking ice-cold ginger ale. His eyes were as low as his voice, and like most people on Mulberry Island, it was difficult to tell where he came from just by looking at his appearance. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“Although I am not a real Sandao person, when I talked about the revolution with many Sandao people, I found that their memories of it and their The definition of it - whether it is good or bad, good or bad, depends largely on who they consider their best friend, who they often share a pot of coffee with, or who they often invite into their home. Relatives and friends for dinner, in general, are extremely personal. For example, if your best friend is an Indian or a Shiraz, your evaluation of the revolution may be completely different. , because the Indians may be robbed and killed, but Shiraz can escape unscathed...&quot; Wilson said slowly. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“But in fact, the revolution had already begun to take shape before 1964,” Wilson continued, “because it had only been more than half a century since slavery was abolished. , the old skeleton of society was basically shattered, and a reasonable new skeleton had not yet taken shape. It was full of loopholes. In addition, the British implemented many policies and regulations on clear class divisions. The Arabs still occupied a large number of people in San Island at that time. Absolutely outstanding status. So when the British withdrew, the undercurrent of conflict between the majority of landless African laborers and the minority of Arab landowners immediately transformed into a revolution.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>;Wilson still remembers that in 1963, in Stone Town after independence, the iron gates of the police station were opened one after another, and all the imprisoned and beaten Africans poured into the streets and alleys, with eyes full of resentment and rage, as if they were gathering strength. , volcanic lava ready to erupt at any time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At 3 a.m. on January 12, 1964, the &quot;African-Shirazi Party&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>; (ASP, Afro-Shirazi Party&quot; member and Ugandan John Okello led 600-800 &quot;revolutionaries&quot; with extremely simple equipment to launch a surprise attack on the police headquarters and radio station. They had no guns and ammunition, only spears, machetes, iron rods and daggers. However, because of their surprise and desperate determination, they won comprehensively in just a few hours. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In this regard, the leader of the revolution, Oklo, always insisted that the actions of himself and other insurrectionists were &quot;pilgrimage acts&quot; in order to do justice for heaven and liberate the people who were persecuted.

At the seaside, I remembered that I and my friend Bosie once sat on the pier like this, &quot;watching the sea foaming with hands and feet and gnashing teeth.&quot; I remembered that on the same day, they paddled out to sea in a small boat and enjoyed that moment &quot;like &quot;Freedom without borders&quot;, watch how the Stone City gradually becomes smaller and smaller behind you, until &quot;it seems to have turned into a beautiful mirage&quot;. At that moment, they fantasized about escaping from the narrow and twisted streets of this small town and going to the distance to find opportunities as colorful as soap bubbles. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/3f125a9a5679eec53025d346922a999f.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/3f125a9a5679eec53025d346922a999f.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;169425&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Picture of a boy diving near Stone City Pier/ICphoto&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Suddenly, the wind direction and ocean current seemed to be disturbed, and the boat started to stumble. Dauda became wary, but Bossi told him with a smile that this was just a sign that the northeast monsoon &quot;musim&quot; was blowing from the coast of India and Arabia to East Africa, while rowing the boat steadily steadily. When the sea seemed to have calmed down, Bosie explained why he could not leave his mother and daughter and go to England with Dauda, ​​and then come back to take care of them after he had established a foothold:&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style &quot;One day, these people who we have regarded and used as slaves for centuries will unite and cut the throats of those who enslaved them.

Who will care about us? They just They will tell us that this is Africa, their Africa, even though we have lived on this land for more years than they have.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Bosi then handed the boat over to Dao As a challenge, he was asked to row the boat back to the shore and jump into the sea to swim back by himself. But the sea suddenly changed its face, and fierce hurricanes filled the entire ocean. &quot;I was struggling and beating the wooden paddle randomly,&quot; Daoda recalled, &quot;but when the storm finally calmed down, I looked around, but No more Bosie.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote data-type=&quot;2&quot; data-url=&quot;&quot; data-author-name=&quot;&quot; data-content-utf8-length=&quot;132&quot; data-source-title=&quot;&quot;>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;>;&quot;I can&#39;t find him...

The moment I landed, I was beaten with sticks and stones.&quot;&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>; Gurner set the two endpoints of the timeline in &quot;a certain November when the northeast monsoon is about to begin as usual and merchants are about to visit East Africa again, and the slave trade is about to begin. It will be between November, when the trade of Sang Island once again reached a climax, and January 12, when the revolution of Sang Island broke out in 1964. Drag the scale back and forth between these two points, discrete and aggregate, and start over and over again. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Later, Wilson took me to a beach 40 kilometers away from the B&amp;B, where he and his family had sat and waited for hundreds of hours under the scorching sun.

Like almost all his novels, it is also about &quot;wanting to escape from a foreign land that cannot be escaped, and wanting to return to a foreign land that cannot be escaped.&quot; The story of immigrants who cannot return to their hometown. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the same year, after years of struggling with his inner alter ego, Wilson finally plucked up the courage to return to Mulberry Island alone. Not long after he settled down, he met his current wife, Khadija, a girl who was almost 30 years younger than him and born and raised in Sang Island. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The afternoon after returning from the beach with Wilson, Khadija and I sat on a wicker chair by the sea, picking fresh wild spinach and preparing dinner together. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Hadija was born in the 1970s and grew up in a fisherman&#39;s home. She only had general concepts about the slave trade, colonization and revolution, and did not have many specific feelings. Wilson almost never mentioned to her those bitter memories that had been sealed for a long time and seemed to have happened yesterday. &quot;I fell in love with her simplicity, carefreeness, and no need to be entangled in the past... In short, I fell in love with her.&quot; , experiencing too much is not a good thing. Fortunately, the current generation of Sang Island has revived because of tourism. After many years, the sea is no longer just a symbol for most people. With the pain and shadow, it once again became their hope.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Wilson&#39;s emotion is still in my mind yesterday, reminding me of a passage in Gurner&#39;s book Words: &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote data-type=&quot;2&quot; data-url=&quot;&quot; data-author-name=&quot;&quot; data-content-utf8-length=&quot;129&quot; data-source-title= &quot;&quot;>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;>;&quot;Going back to the beach feels like returning home. How can I put it? It&#39;s like I can realize that this place once belonged to me... No matter where you go here, you will be treated like one of your own family... I can still feel the generosity in her bones from this place. Nobility and palpable passion.&quot; (&quot;By the Sea&quot;, 2001) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 30 Sep 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
