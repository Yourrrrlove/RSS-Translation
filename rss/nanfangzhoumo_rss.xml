The people in Xiangtan, Hunan are addicted to betel nut, which was originally needed to treat diseases and fight epidemics. However, once a habit is formed, it cannot be stopped. Xiangtan was the main distribution center for betel nut from Lingnan to the north in the Qing Dynasty. Several major epidemics in Xiangtan from the forty-fourth year of Qianlong to the second year of Tongzhi promoted the custom of chewing betel nuts. According to industry legends, the key figure in the introduction of betel nut was Bai Jing, the magistrate of Xiangtan County. Bai Jing’s father, Bai Weixi, once served as the magistrate of Yingde County, Guangdong. This was a special opportunity for Lingnan betel nut to be introduced to Xiangtan. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Removing miasma means preventing epidemics&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The ancients have known the medicinal value of betel nut for a long time. Yang Fu, a native of Nanhai in the Eastern Han Dynasty, has recorded the consumption of betel nut in his &quot;Foreign Objects&quot; It can &quot;lower qi&quot; and aid digestion. Since then, there have been endless literature records about betel nut&#39;s functions of lowering qi, reducing swelling, repelling insects, repelling miasma, and treating epidemics. The article &quot;Miasma, Plague and Addiction: The Spread and Reconstruction of Betel Nut Food Customs in Local Social Changes&quot; by Zhang Enxun and Shen Lingling of Xiangtan University comprehensively sorted out the discussions on the medicinal value of betel nut in the past dynasties, and pointed out: &quot;Betel nut was the most important food in the Tang and Song Dynasties. As the central government developed tools for removing miasma in Lingnan, during the Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China, betel nut became a medicinal material for treating plague that witnessed the development of commercial networks and local social changes in modern China.&quot; Here &quot;treating plague&quot; and &quot;removing miasma&quot;, in other words It’s about epidemic prevention and control. Whether in Fujian, Guangdong or Hunan, the original legitimate reason for chewing betel nut is to prevent and cure epidemics. This does not exclude some people from eating betel nut in search of pleasure or for ceremonial needs. The three can coexist at the same time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ancients used medicinal plants to ward off miasma and prevent epidemics. In the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, some people spread the idea that smoking can ward off miasma. Zhu Shengheng, a scholar in Xiangtan in the Qing Dynasty, wrote an article &quot;Wilder Theory&quot;: &quot;Lu Song produces wilted leaves. If you cut them and smoke them, they are said to be able to ward off miasma.&quot; People in Xiangtan call tobacco leaves &quot;wilt leaves&quot;. The article believes that Luzon cigarettes were introduced to Fujian in the early Qing Dynasty and soon became popular all over the country. However, the reason why people smoked at first was to &quot;prevent miasma&quot;. Zhu Shengheng had a profound understanding of the dangers of smoking and pointed out that &quot;the harm of wilting is related to opium&quot;. (He Gejin edited and annotated pages 504-505 of the second volume of &quot;Selected Essays of Xiangtan Dynasties&quot;) It is worth noting that both tobacco and betel nut can be addictive. Just as the Qing court called opium a &quot;foreign medicine,&quot; cigarette merchants and betel nut merchants emphasized its medicinal value in order to eliminate people&#39;s psychological barriers to addictive foods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chewing betel nut can lead to addiction and waste money, which is contrary to the Confucian values ​​​​of the Ming and Qing Dynasties. Hunan society has long advocated frugality, and mainstream literati were very repulsive to this idea. Luo Ruhuai, a well-known scholar in Xiangtan, felt that chewing betel nut was a waste of money: &quot;The Gaitan people chewed betel nut even though they chewed it when they were children. People who have heard of it say that it costs a hundred coins in its prime, but the cost of a family throughout the year is often Twenty or thirty years old, isn’t it also diān?” (Page 262 of &quot;Luo Ruhuai Collection&quot;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Businessmen who deal in betel nuts must have high-sounding reasons to resist the criticism of the Confucian class and tempt Consumption, medical treatment and epidemic prevention are the most legitimate reasons. Before the popularization of modern medicine, people generally believed that &quot;miasma&quot; existed in southern provinces. Lingnan, Hunan, Guizhou and other places were once considered &quot;miasma areas&quot;, and infection with &quot;miasma&quot; was often fatal. So, if smoking and chewing betel nut can ward off &quot;miasma&quot;, there is no doubt about its legitimacy. After all, life-saving is the first priority. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the Xiangtan epidemic in the 44th year of Qianlong&#39;s reign, Bai Jing, the county magistrate, used betel nut to treat the &quot;bulging disease&quot; among residents. This led to the formation of the custom of chewing betel nut, which has since become popular after several major epidemics. This explanation seems to be The most reasonable. The two &quot;Xiangtan County Chronicles&quot; of the Qianlong Dynasty do not mention betel nut, but the Jiaqing &quot;Xiangtan County Chronicle&quot; clearly records that &quot;betel nut and wilted leaves are a hobby&quot;, which can prove that this custom was formed between the late Qianlong Dynasty and the early Jiaqing Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/jCrzhRxq7xXdSOsG8coxqKII3uojM8yiaKJ0hOlx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;833&quot; height= &quot;1189&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/jCrzhRxq7xXdSOsG8coxqKII3uojM8yiaKJ0hOlx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251273&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Cao Yu&#39;s book and video of &quot;One Chew for Two Thousand Years: From Medicine to Drug, the Popular History of Betel Nut in China&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The promotion of Xiangtan Magistrate Bai Jing&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Young scholar Cao Yu&#39;s &quot;Yi Chew&quot; The book &quot;Two Thousand Years: From Medicine to Drug, the Popular History of Betel Nut in China&quot; attempts to provide a new explanation for the origin of the custom of chewing betel nut in Xiangtan, Hunan. He synthesized the research results of various parties and revealed that Xiangtan was both a rice market and a distribution center for medicinal materials. During the Tongzhi period, there were sufficient betel nut stocks and the return of the Hunan army led to an increase in consumption capacity. The overland trade of betel nut from Lingnan to the north originally had two routes: the east route (via Jiangxi) and the west route (via Hunan). The Taiping Rebellion war blocked the east route, and Xiangtan&#39;s position as a commercial center was strengthened during the Taiping Rebellion. Betel nuts from Lingnan and across the mountains to the north are first gathered in Xiangtan and then distributed throughout the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cao Yu focused his attention on the disbandment of the Hunan Army in 1864, and made the following two conclusions in the book: &quot;The habit of chewing betel nuts in the Xiangtan area is likely to be caused by these two forces-the backlog. The custom of chewing betel nuts in Xiangtan flourished from 1864 to 1880. During this period, no large-scale plague occurred in Xiangtan, so chewing betel nuts was a common practice. The legend of eating betel nut to avoid the epidemic is not a historical fact...&quot; Cao Yu chose the blank period of the epidemic recorded in Guangxu&#39;s &quot;Xiangtan County Chronicle&quot; for demonstration, but Jiaqing&#39;s &quot;Xiangtan County Chronicle&quot; records that the consumption of betel nuts in Xiangtan was very popular in the early Jiaqing period, and this account was ignored . If we must consider the role of demobilizing the Hunan Army, I think these retired soldiers just spread the custom of betel nut eating to various counties in Hunan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/RcwjQ3vjzJX6sZUqrKPfwet1YlrZrwuoxkQGBOnP.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;601&quot; height= &quot;911&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/RcwjQ3vjzJX6sZUqrKPfwet1YlrZrwuoxkQGBOnP.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251272&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Xiangtan County Chronicle&quot; records about betel nut eating customs. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Xiangtan County Chronicle&quot; compiled by Wang Kaiyun and published in the 15th year of Guangxu&#39;s reign is the basic historical material for studying the betel nut food customs in Xiangtan. Volume 9 of the book &quot;Huo Zhi&quot; states: &quot;In Guangzhou merchants, silver vermilion, sunflower fan, and betel nut are the most popular. Dozens of people are cut off every day at home, and the shop is twice as prosperous. ... If you calculate that you can earn a hundred qian a day, you should spend 5 qian a month. Six million, spending more than two million for such a year...it&#39;s a lot of money.&quot; Silver vermilion and betel nut came to Xiangtan as medicinal materials, but the addictive nature of betel nut makes it difficult for consumers to stop once they accept it. As a local literary leader, Wang Kaiyun was very disgusted with the consumption of betel nuts. In his preface to the county annals, he criticized &quot;the cost of betel nuts is equivalent to rice beams.&quot; This means that the people in Xiangtan spent almost the same amount on betel nuts as they spent on food. Because of his job, Wang Kaiyun only talked about the scale of the betel nut business in his chronicle, and was not willing to discuss the origin of betel nut consumption in Xiangtan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The author believes that the custom of betel nut consumption in Xiangtan was promoted by several major epidemics in the Qing Dynasty. The key year was the forty-fourth year of Qianlong. Volume 9 of Guangxu&#39;s &quot;Xiangtan County Chronicles&quot; &quot;Five Elements Chronicles·Epidemic&quot; records &quot;the great epidemic in the forty-fourth year of Qianlong&quot;, &quot;the great epidemic in April of the sixteenth year of Daoguang&quot;, &quot;the great epidemic in the twenty-second year of Daoguang&quot; and &quot;in July of the second year of Tongzhi&quot; epidemic&quot;. The forty-fourth year of Qianlong&#39;s reign was 1779, which was a key year for the formation of betel nut eating customs in Xiangtan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huang Junliang, the veteran of the betel nut industry in Xiangtan, recorded this legend: There was a great epidemic in the 44th year of Qianlong&#39;s reign. Many residents suffered from bulging disease and medicine was ineffective. The county magistrate Bai Jing, who was from Guangdong, was well versed in medical theory and understood the properties of medicine. He gave the medicinal betel nuts he brought to the patients to chew. After chewing them, they all felt their abdomens felt comfortable. After chewing them several times, the swelling disappeared and the pain was relieved. After that, the original patient chewed it, and the non-patients also chewed it, and the habit gradually formed, &quot;but at that time, betel nut was regarded as a kind of medicine.&quot; (Huang Junliang: &quot;What I Know about the Betel Nut Industry in Xiangtan&quot;, &quot;Xiangtan Literary History&quot; Series 12) Huang Junliang has been an apprentice in a betel nut shop since 1926. The deeds he knows about Bai Jing belong to the common memory of the industry and cannot be ignored. It is understandable that scholars such as Zhou Daming, Zhang Enxun, Shen Lingling and others doubted the authenticity of the legend in the industry because they discovered that Bai Jing was born in Fengtian, but they did not pay attention to Bai Jing&#39;s connection with Guangdong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bai Jing, whose courtesy name is Xi Song Dynasty and whose name is Puzhai, is a bannerman of the Han army with a white flag in the sky. When he was appointed as the magistrate of Xiangtan County, he wrote an article called &quot;The Stele of Yanxi Pavilion&quot; and said: &quot;I was kind to the family and was raised in the office. At that time, Xu Yu said that your father was a wise man and had good governance...&quot; (Jiaqing&#39;s &quot;Xiangtan County Chronicle·Art&quot;) &quot;Wen&quot;) that is, Bai Jing&#39;s father served as the magistrate of Yingde County, Guangdong. According to Daoguang&#39;s &quot;Yingde County Chronicle&quot;, the county magistrate Bai Weixi from the 15th to 19th years of Qianlong&#39;s reign was a person with a white banner. Based on this, it can be roughly determined that Bai Weixi is Bai Jing&#39;s father. Most of the family members of officials lived with them. Bai Jing should have lived in Guangdong, so she was misunderstood as a &quot;Cantonese&quot;. The author believes that it was their father and son&#39;s experience in Guangdong that led Bai Jing to use the medicinal betel nut brought from Guangdong to treat the residents when the epidemic and &quot;bulging disease&quot; were prevalent in Xiangtan. Wang Kaiyun had a prejudice against Bai Jing, perhaps because of his introduction of betel nuts. In the biography of officials and teachers in &quot;Xiangtan County Chronicle&quot;, Wang Kaiyun commented that Bai Jing&#39;s governance &quot;was a little arbitrary or biased, and there are similarities and differences among the commentators so far.&quot; Wang Kaiyun wrote &quot;The pastoral order is responsible for his forgiveness&quot;, indicating that he was very dissatisfied with Bai Jing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 16th year of Daoguang (1836), the 22nd year (1842), and the second year of Tongzhi (1863), several major epidemics occurred in Xiangtan, which made the custom of betel nut popular in Xiangtan. For the Xiangtan people to form the custom of chewing betel nuts, sufficient supply was only a sufficient condition, and the occurrence of several major epidemics was a necessary condition. The key figure in the formation of the custom was the county magistrate Bai Jing. The custom of betel nut eating in Xiangtan began to take shape in the forty-fourth year of Qianlong&#39;s reign due to Bai Jing&#39;s promotion. After several major epidemics, it became more popular. The traditional medical theory of betel nut to prevent plague and prevent miasma successfully connected the two. Modern medicine has proven that chewing betel nut has the risk of causing oral cancer. As for its anti-epidemic effect, everyone has different opinions, but the ancients believed it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[博主用无人机跟踪女性被抓，高科技产品何以沦为隐私“刺客”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257244]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-20 23:22:15&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 23:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[引资、清欠、对接客户，民营经济发展局的地方经验]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257186]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-20 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/20/Rvy8q7luPDejmkqUB9hN86ERPv2YIOGA9TsHDna4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1700&quot; height=&quot;1123&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/Rvy8q7luPDejmkqUB9hN86ERPv2YIOGA9TsHD na4. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251276&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 4, 2023, Cong Liang, deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission, introduced that the Central Committee The Editorial Office officially approved the establishment of the Private Economic Development Bureau within the National Development and Reform Commission. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once the Private Economic Development Bureau was established, it attracted the attention of the whole society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 4, 2023, Cong Liang, deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission, introduced that the Central Organization Office officially approved the establishment of a Private Economic Development Bureau within the National Development and Reform Commission. It is a specialized agency to promote the development and growth of the private economy. Its role is to strengthen the overall coordination of policies in related fields and promote the implementation of various major measures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cong Liang introduced that the main responsibility of the bureau is to formulate policies to promote private economic development and establish a communication mechanism with private enterprises. In the more than 100-word description of responsibilities, there is no word related to &quot;management&quot;, but &quot;service&quot; is the main word. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the first time a private economic development bureau has been established at the national ministry level, but it is no stranger to it at the local level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters searched Qichacha and local government official websites and found that at the peak of the country, there were more than 200 related agencies such as private economic development bureaus, private economic development promotion bureaus, and private economic development service bureaus. Now, There are still more than 180 private economic development bureaus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They belong to different departments in different places. For example, the local industry and information technology departments will have small and medium-sized enterprise development agencies, and the market supervision department will also have internal agencies to promote the private economy. The human resources and social security, taxation, judicial, and financial supervision departments will also have corresponding service offices as needed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The starting point was around 2000. At that time, some provinces, cities, districts and counties began to set up departments related to private economic development, and added the brands of Township Enterprise Administration or Small and Medium Enterprises Bureau, and then the names would be many times. change. After 2019, local small and medium-sized enterprise bureaus were abolished under institutional reform and adjustment, and have now become subordinate offices of local industry and information bureaus, economic and information bureaus or market supervision bureaus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the relevant institutions add a brand to the existing institutions, that is, one team and two brands. Only a few areas have set up a separate &quot;Private Economic Development Bureau&quot; as a municipal government agency. Government departments, such as Qingdao, Ya&#39;an, Jinan, Chongqing Beibei District, Chongqing Jiulongpo District, etc., are generally established after 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What kind of exploration experience and inspiration can these local experiences provide to national departments? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Private bureaus have long existed in many places&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As early as around 2000, some provincial governments already had agencies responsible for the private economy, named Township Enterprise Administration Bureau, Private Economic Administration Bureau, Small and Medium Enterprises Bureau, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After several institutional reforms, their figures have been blurred. Now, their development can only be seen through public documents such as cadre resumes, budget and final accounts of the year, unit profiles, and function introductions on the government’s official website. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, the resume of a cadre from the Industry and Information Technology Bureau of Yucheng City, Dezhou City, Shandong Province stated that he worked for the Private Economic Development Bureau of Yucheng City from 1997 to 2013. After that, the company he worked for was changed to the Economic and Information Technology Bureau of Yucheng City. Bureau of Industry and Information Technology, and will become Yucheng City Industry and Information Technology Bureau after 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For another example, the Shanxi Luliang Lishi District Small and Medium Enterprises Service Center details its development history in the official website introduction. Its predecessor was the Lishi County Community and Team Enterprise Management Bureau in 1976, and was changed to the Lishi County Community and Team Enterprise Management Bureau in 1984. The Lishi County Township Enterprise Administration Bureau established the Lishi Township Enterprise Service Center after the organizational reform in 2002, and was listed as the Lishi Private Economic Development Bureau. This agency began to be responsible for the supervision, guidance, coordination and services of small and medium-sized enterprises, township enterprises and the private economy in the region. In August 2004, it was renamed &quot;Lishi District Small and Medium Enterprises Bureau&quot; again, retaining the brand of &quot;Lishi District Private Economic Development Bureau&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the book &quot;Shanxi Economy: Forty Years of Reform and Opening Up&quot;, in 2003, Shanxi Province adjusted its organizational structure and transitioned the provincial-level Township Enterprise Administration Bureau to the Private Economic Development Bureau. The following year, it added It has the sign of Shanxi Provincial Small and Medium Enterprises Bureau. Since then, 11 prefecture-level cities and 119 counties and cities in Shanxi Province have established small and medium-sized enterprise bureaus, and their functions have been expanded from the original township enterprises to county economies, private economies, and small and medium-sized enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Xiaofeng, director of the Office of Private Economic Development Bureau of Qingdao, Shandong Province, told Southern Weekend reporters that before and after the institutional reform in 2019, small and medium-sized enterprise bureaus across the country were withdrawn and merged, and the functions of the original small and medium-sized enterprise bureaus were merged into the local industry and information bureaus and economic bureaus. The Information Bureau and the Market Supervision Bureau will add the Small and Medium Enterprises Bureau brand to these departments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, the Industry and Information Technology Bureaus of Taiyuan City, Shuozhou City, Luliang City, Yangquan City, Yuncheng City and other places in Shanxi Province have added the name of Private Economic Development Promotion Bureau, and the districts and counties under their jurisdiction have also The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has added the name of the Private Economic Development Promotion Bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wenzhou has added the name of the Private Economic Health Development Promotion Bureau to the Municipal Economic and Information Technology Bureau. Guang&#39;an, Zigong and Ziyang in Sichuan Province have also registered private economic development bureaus in the Economic and Information Bureau, while Neijiang, Aba and Liangshan prefectures have registered private economic development bureaus in the Market Supervision Bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Over the past two decades, the emergence of private economic development bureaus in local government agencies has roughly coincided with the peak of the central government’s policies to encourage the development of the private economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2005, the &quot;36 Non-Public Economy Articles&quot; was the first central document to promote the development of the non-public economy since the founding of New China. In 2019, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the &quot;Opinions on Creating a Better Development Environment to Support the Reform and Development of Private Enterprises&quot; to support the private economy in many aspects. In 2023, the &quot;Opinions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Promoting the Development and Growth of the Private Economy&quot; was publicly released, proposing 31 policies and measures to encourage and promote private enterprises to become better, bigger and stronger. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Need a comprehensive coordination department&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2015, Li Xiaofeng worked in the Private Economic Development Division of the Enterprise Registration Bureau under the Qingdao Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce, doing comprehensive coordination for private enterprises The work includes formulating the key points of the national private economy work and gathering relevant data on private market entities that were originally scattered in various departments. &quot;It is better to do macro-level work and understand the overall situation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scope of the work of the Industrial and Commercial Bureau on the private economy is limited to this. Although other departments also have work related to the private economy, they are all in Fulfill responsibilities within their respective scope. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, the Qingdao Municipal Government carried out institutional reforms. Under the condition of a limit of 38 working departments, the Private Economic Development Bureau and the Ocean Bureau were added to the reform plan. These two bureaus became components of the municipal government. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, Li Xiaofeng was transferred to the Private Economic Development Bureau and served successively as the director of the Coordination and Guidance Division and the director of the office. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He explained to Southern Weekend reporters that in the past, although different units had departments serving the private economy, their focus was different due to functional limitations. For example, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology pays more attention to industrial enterprises and their industries, while departments such as science and technology and commerce focus on high-tech, consumer enterprises and their industry development. A full-time department must be established to cover all aspects of private economic development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the original agency, Li Xiaofeng found that the private economic development bureau, a dedicated department, can play a better coordination role. &quot;We are now doing comprehensive coordination, platform building and other service work, not industry authorities.&quot; , closer to the role of the integrated department.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The advantage of this role is that it facilitates coordination between various departments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Private economic work covers a wide range of areas and is highly policy-oriented, requiring close collaboration among various departments to form a synergy.” Zhang Shixin, deputy secretary-general of the National Development and Reform Commission and director of the Personnel Department, also made a similar statement in an interview. The National Development and Reform Commission established the Private Economic Development Bureau in order to better play the role of overall coordination, comprehensive policy implementation, and promotion of development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Li Xiaofeng believes that at the national level, the Private Economic Development Bureau is an internal agency of the National Development and Reform Commission. There is no need to dissolve and merge relevant departments that have been established separately but are not placed in the National Development and Reform Commission. &quot;Serving private enterprises inherently involves coordination and cooperation among multiple departments, and there will be no overlapping or conflicting functions.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Now Qingdao&#39;s private economy does not support half the sky, but is the main force.&quot; Li Xiaofeng told the South Weekend reporter, Qingdao’s private investment can still maintain double-digit growth from 2019 to 2020. From January to July 2023, Qingdao&#39;s private investment grew by 6.1%, 6.6 percentage points higher than the national average. Private investment projects under construction drove investment by 3.6 percentage points and contributed 77.3% to the city&#39;s investment growth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Office of Jinan Private Economic Development Bureau wrote a reply to Southern Weekend reporter: The bureau was established in March 2019. In the first half of 2019, the number of private market entities in Jinan was 993,300, and currently it is 1.505 million, accounting for 98.6% of the city’s market entities. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Serving private enterprises that meet industrial needs&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The first step in providing good services is to let private enterprises and local private bureaus understand each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, the Qingdao Private Enterprise Bureau understands the situation of private enterprises through streets, districts and cities, and has set up 300 enterprise policy service specialists composed of government personnel and enterprise service agencies. On the other hand, it sets up a system for private enterprises through gradient cultivation and management. Different growth tracks, discover small and medium-sized enterprises with development potential. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qingdao Yunlu Co., Ltd. (688190.SH) project leader Geng Runer told Southern Weekend reporters that receiving the honorary title from the government is an affirmation of the company and provides a measurement standard for investment institutions and financial institutions to judge the value of the company. , which helps corporate financing to a certain extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yunlu Co., Ltd. is engaged in the design, development and sales of advanced magnetic metal materials. It is a mixed-ownership enterprise with shares held by central enterprises. Geng Runer is mainly responsible for project declaration and other work. She said the company has become a unicorn with support from the local government. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Qingdao’s 2023 public list of innovative small and medium-sized enterprises, most of the awarded companies are high-tech and other new manufacturing industries, with occasionally one or two companies related to the food and clothing industries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person in charge of a Qingdao garment factory told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;We may have contacted the private bureau, but we don&#39;t know much about it.&quot; The main dilemma faced by enterprises at present is the high labor cost. Many garment factories in the industry have moved to Southeast Asia, India and other places with lower labor costs. Her company mainly undertakes OEM foreign trade orders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Many people would rather earn a salary of 3,000 yuan in an urban office than work in a factory. (The salary) is over 6,000 yuan and no one comes,” she said. She is now also seeking transformation for the company, no longer following the OEM model, and trying to operate her own brand through the Internet platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Xiaofeng said that every local government has its own industries that it focuses on developing. Qingdao has 24 key industrial chains, which are consistent with Qingdao’s urban industrial planning and development needs. Textile and clothing is an advantageous industrial chain among the 24 industrial chains. For example, Qingdao Kute Intelligent Enterprise has found a transformation path in personalized intelligent customization of clothing. &quot;It still depends on whether the enterprise&#39;s model and core competitiveness can adapt to the development and changes of the social situation, so as to effectively respond to the market-oriented survival of the fittest.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Jinan, the main practices of the private bureau include establishing private economic monitoring and analysis services The system monitors and analyzes comprehensive indicators such as operating income, profits and taxes, and R&amp;D investment, and dynamically grasps the development of private enterprises. The bureau also requested the municipal government to issue &quot;Several Measures on Carrying out Climbing Actions to Support the Leapfrog Development of Private Enterprises&quot;, clearly implement 21 cultivation measures in 5 major actions including financing promotion, and carry out a 5-year targeted cultivation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A staff member of a cryptographic company located in Jinan said that the relevant departments of the Jinan Municipal Government have helped them solve issues such as office space property rights and matching financing needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A staff member of another biopharmaceutical company located in Jinan told Southern Weekend reporters that they are a leading company in the local area. Jinan’s business environment has developed greatly in recent years, and the city has set up dedicated services for leading companies. &quot;After all, large companies are large and make great contributions.&quot; He affirmed the work of the government, but also said that it is difficult to address all aspects of enterprise personalized issues and provide adequate services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, Jinan’s four leading industries are big data and new generation information technology industry, intelligent manufacturing and high-end equipment industry, biomedicine and comprehensive health industry, and high-quality steel and advanced materials industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;When do businesses need the government? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Due to his work, Li Xiaofeng often comes into contact with private enterprises of various sizes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his view, in the past when enterprises dealt with the government, they hoped that the government would not disturb them. However, in critical periods such as the early stages of enterprise development and bottleneck periods, the government also needs to provide resource support. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Geng Runer once represented the company in a creative meeting organized by the Private Economic Development Bureau, and the company put forward development demands with creative solutions. The plan jointly submitted by Yunlu Co., Ltd. and downstream companies is amorphous high-efficiency energy-saving transformers. The main customers are local power supply bureaus and urban rail transit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A creative meeting will invite 3-5 companies to share their proposals. In addition to business representatives, there were also government staff, project reviewers and invited customer representatives present. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recommending products to state-owned enterprise users on government platforms is undoubtedly a shortcut to quickly open up customer sources and build trust between both parties. Two months after the creative meeting, Yunlu Co., Ltd. successfully participated in the communication and promotion meeting for the follow-up project implementation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Xiaofeng told Southern Weekend reporters that companies of all sizes participating in the creative meeting will be selected in the early stage. The ideas proposed by the companies will be selected. The selected ideas will be fully demonstrated by experts from the private sector bureau and relevant government departments, and they are in line with Qingdao’s industry. Projects in the development direction can enter subsequent promotion meetings, and coordinate various relevant departments to resolve the resources needed for project and industrial development, such as land, talents, funds, etc., which are generally concerned by enterprises. Since 2019, more than ten events have been held, attracting an investment amount of approximately 40 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Geng Runer said that because they are in a &quot;stuck&quot; industry such as key materials technology, there is an urgent need for talents. The Private Sector Bureau and the Human Resources and Social Security Bureau helped the company introduce a Japanese expert and solved the problem for the expert. Talent green card issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of funding, Li Xiaofeng introduced that in addition to certain rewards and subsidies for some companies after listing, the Financing Cooperation Office of the Private Sector Bureau will also organize matchmaking activities such as &quot;Government, Bank and Enterprise&quot; to guide private companies in need to connect with finance. Institutions, companies raise financial needs, and financial institutions promote products. &quot;Compared with the company going door to door to find banking institutions, he can contact eight to ten financial institutions once he participates in the matching event.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jinan Private Economic Development Bureau also mentioned in its written reply that they established The Cultivation Database of Ten Thousand Potential Enterprises, the Cultivation Database of Thousands of Key Enterprises and the Database of Hundreds of Investment Institutions have connected local private enterprises to obtain 280 rounds of fund investment. At the same time, it also promotes the connection between corporate financing needs and banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liang Sheng is the head of a company that provides service products to government departments. His company has conducted business in many places across the country and mainly obtained government procurement projects through bidding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his view, most private enterprises that provide service products to the government will inevitably encounter the problem of &quot;difficulty in collecting accounts&quot;. It often happens that the accounts are delayed, and some private enterprises will also Encountered a situation where &quot;new officials ignore old accounts&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2023, the National Development and Reform Commission and other departments issued 28 specific measures to promote the solution of outstanding problems faced in the development of the private economy, including increasing efforts to clean up the accounts owed to private enterprises, focusing on cleaning up Accounts owed to small, medium and micro enterprises by government agencies, institutions, and state-owned enterprises, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Xiaofeng introduced that the Qingdao Private Sector Bureau has been paying attention to this problem since its early establishment and began to clear arrears for small and medium-sized enterprises in 2019. As long as the enterprise raises the issue, the private sector bureau will take the lead in issuing supervision orders to government departments that are confirmed to have delinquent accounts after investigation, urging them to pay off the delinquent accounts owed to small and medium-sized enterprises in installments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(At the request of the interviewee, Liang Sheng is a pseudonym in the article.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 23:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[室同道合？一份包含MBTI的大学宿舍分配问卷背后]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257236]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-20 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/20/WMQEIGA7Wvi4EPEkbHyFT4Z5APMlsNC8bZMa7Kli.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;753&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/WMQEIGA7Wvi4EPEkbHyFT4Z5APMlsNC8bZMa7Kli. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251432&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Nongjian/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is still one week before the start of the semester. On the evening of August 10, 2023, 115 undergraduate freshmen in the class of 2023 at the Zhiyi Academy of Beijing Institute of Technology received a questionnaire, including MBTI, favorite &quot; &quot;Idol&quot; (idol, refers to idol artists), as well as work and rest habits. This questionnaire is prepared for freshman dormitory assignment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before dawn the next day, the dormitory list was released. The person who was commissioned to design the questionnaire was their senior sister, Lu Jiahui, a 2022 student of Zhiyi Academy. Her original intention in designing the questionnaire was to bring people in the same circle together based on the results of the questionnaire, &quot;so that they can spend their four years in college more happily.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lv Jiahui’s own dormitory experience was somewhat regretful. The roommates had different hobbies and “basically had nothing to talk about.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Soon, this questionnaire was posted on social media, and the topic &quot;BIT Dormitory Allocation Statistics MBTI&quot; became a hot search topic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, dormitory allocation in colleges and universities was often done randomly. Nowadays, more and more colleges and universities are exploring other methods, and MBTI is just the latest one. Nanjing University and Chengdu University use questionnaires to collect information about freshmen, and then assign or recommend roommates to them through algorithms; while some schools such as Communication University of China and Zhuhai Institute of Science and Technology (formerly Jilin University Zhuhai College) give students the right to choose. Spontaneously organize and publish &quot;resumes&quot; written with their living habits, personality and hobbies to find suitable roommates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The seemingly various allocation methods are more or less designed to avoid possible conflicts in university dormitories. Wang Qing, a lecturer at the School of Humanities at Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics, has studied the relationship between university dormitories. She believes that &quot;if these factors are taken into account when arranging dormitories, conflicts will be reduced to a certain extent.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind the dormitory conflicts There is another deeper social and cultural change of youth. Wang Qing also agreed: dormitory allocation can only solve part of the contradiction. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;BIT Dormitory Allocation Statistics&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;MBTI&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The most concerning question in this dormitory allocation questionnaire is: MBTI is one of the most popular personality tests today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;MBTI is the abbreviation of Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. The test result consists of 4 letters and refers to a person’s attention direction, cognitive style, judgment style and lifestyle. Dimensional tendencies. The framers were an American mother and daughter named Briggs and Myers respectively. In the eyes of this mother and daughter who had no professional background in psychology, they could use four rulers to classify complex human nature into 16 species. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The MBTI test has been widely used in company recruitment and team building, but its scientific validity has also been questioned. Some studies have found that more than half of people retest after a few weeks or more than a year. , will get different results, so there are flaws in its consistency, stability and reliability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Jiahui, who allocates dormitories to 115 freshmen, is a &quot;peer mentor&quot;, that is, a senior who answers questions in the freshmen group. She believes in the accuracy of the MBTI. Her MBTI type is &quot;entj&quot;, which is called a commander personality. This type of person tends to make quick decisions and has strong action ability. It only took her an hour and a half to complete the questionnaire design, and sent it out at 7:30 pm on the 10th. At 4:30 am on the 11th, the dormitory allocation results for the entire grade were sent to the group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The questionnaire was quickly posted online. On August 12, Lu Jiahui discovered that the entry &quot;BIT dormitory allocation statistics MBTI&quot; had been on the hot search list for nearly ten hours, ranking highest at second place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to MBTI, the questionnaire also discussed whether snoring, talking in sleep, getting up at night, chasing stars, &quot;two-spined salamander&quot; (two-dimensional), etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The questionnaire also attracted attention within BIT. “My counselor’s phone number was blown up by counselors from other colleges.” Then, the questionnaire became popular in the school. Someone left a screenshot of the same questionnaire on Lu Jiahui’s social media: “The College of Economics and Management also has it! ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This trend has spread to more colleges and universities. On August 29, a student at the School of Intelligent Accounting and Management of Guangdong University of Finance and Economics discovered that the questionnaire collected by her college for dormitory allocation only included MBTI types, and the final allocation results were mainly based on &quot;i people&quot; (introverts) and &quot;e people&quot; ” (extrovert) distinction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ru Jingfei, a counselor at the School of Law of Southwest University of Political Science and Law, looks for inspiration in her own employment guidance and mental health classes. In addition to the MBTI, the questionnaire she designed also included &quot;questions that are likely to cause conflicts in dormitory life&quot; collected from graduates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, many colleges and universities have begun to reject the past &quot;blind box&quot; method, which is a randomly assigned dormitory allocation plan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, dormitory allocation mainly considered students with the same major, class, and adjacent student numbers to be grouped together. The ordering of student numbers usually referred to the pinyin and strokes of the surname. There are also schools that arrange dormitories according to the order of registration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, Chengdu University asked freshmen to fill out a questionnaire including questions such as &quot;Are you a social cow or a social fear&quot; and &quot;Do you accept durian, snail noodles and other odorous foods&quot; to match freshmen with roommates. In the same year, according to the official account of Lanzhou University, in order to &quot;allow students to choose like-minded roommates,&quot; some colleges introduced a method of allocating dormitories by selecting roommates from each other, and students posted self-introductions in the group like &quot;writing a resume.&quot; and expectations for roommates, making a two-way choice. When the 2023 freshmen of the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China choose their own rooms online, they can check the waking up and sleeping habits of the selected roommates in a certain room. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/zO1vXlylqmdxb8XSjKWbv3lP67K8DLqIsXTODMm5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;988&quot; height= &quot;659&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/zO1vXlylqmdxb8XSjKWbv3lP67K8DLqIsXTODMm5.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251431&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 16, 2023, the seniors guided the 2023 freshmen to go through the registration procedures at Huzhou College in Zhejiang Province. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Yes&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;iYes&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;e A&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;more interesting&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Controversy also ensued: whether the roommates assigned through MBTI are reliable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Lu Jiahui’s conception, MBTI is not the most important. Her priority was an open-ended fill-in-the-blank question about &quot;other needs&quot; in the questionnaire, and then the order of consideration was: personal work and rest habits, interests and hobbies, and then MBTI. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the open-ended fill-in-the-blank question, some people followed the prompts and filled in who they wanted to live with. If both parties were willing, they would be placed together; some people filled in &quot;I don&#39;t want to be in the same dormitory with star chasers.&quot; &quot;. Through the collected questionnaire answers, Lu Jiahui could not judge who could accept these unexpected demands, but she set a self-evaluation question about &quot;tolerance&quot;, with a full score of 5 points - people with high self-evaluation scores were considered There is a greater chance of accepting the individual needs of roommates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the dormitory allocation of the School of Intelligent Accounting and Management of Guangdong University of Finance and Economics, a freshman observed that the configuration is roughly &quot;two i and two e&quot; in one dormitory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ru Jingfei did not directly judge which personalities are suitable. She reminded students to consider whether they need roommates with complementary or similar personalities. She also suggested that &quot;Having I&#39;s and E&#39;s will make dormitory life more interesting.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different allocation methods are related to different needs. Even on the indicator of student origin, different people have different considerations. Southwest Political Science and Law is located in Chongqing. Ru Jingfei does not recommend that everyone in a dormitory come from the same place, and believes that &quot;it is best to have someone from Sichuan and Chongqing in a dormitory, so that it will be much more convenient when going out to play.&quot; What Lu Jiahui is most afraid of is the difference in eating habits between the north and the south. &quot;It&#39;s very uncomfortable if you can&#39;t eat one piece.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lanzhou University advocates &quot;multicultural integration&quot;. One college stipulates that &quot;each dormitory has students from the south and the north&quot; and &quot;no less than 3 provinces of origin.&quot; &quot;Diversity&quot; also has another meaning. In 2022, in order to avoid collective late arrival at &quot;eight in the morning&quot;, the school&#39;s law school assigned a classmate who is accustomed to getting up early to each dormitory to serve as the &quot;dawn rooster&quot; of each dormitory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The plans vary, but what most designers care about is whether roommates can chat with each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Behind closed doors, the dormitory is just a circle.” A significant comparison is that the college dormitories of Lu Jiahui’s good friends are all “two-dimensional” and they can play well; and her own roommate , there are those who pursue Korean entertainment, and there are those who like racing, &quot;basically there is nothing to talk about.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nanjing University has set up a questionnaire since 2017, which not only counts interests and hobbies, but also uses algorithms to find potential correlations between different hobbies. Guo Yamin, a teacher at the student affairs office of the school, once introduced to the media that the interests and hobbies of the &quot;post-00s generation&quot; are wide and highly dispersed. The school&#39;s &quot;hidden semantic model&quot; algorithm can use some implicit characteristics to deduce the students&#39; possible hobbies from their existing hobbies. Match roommates based on your interests, such as putting those who like drama with those who like history, or those who like biology with those who like physics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, Nanjing University’s questionnaire is adjusted every year. Guo Yamin explained to Southern Weekend reporters, “The concerns of each generation of children are different.” In the 2023 questionnaire, freshmen were asked whether they prefer the AA system (everyone shares the expenses equally) or taking turns to treat guests when going out with their roommates, and whether they can accept invitations from their roommates to go out with friends on weekends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guo Yamin said, &quot;Nowadays, children have lived alone since childhood. When they suddenly enter collective life, there are always a lot of discomforts.&quot; The school&#39;s approach is to try to reduce the &quot;discomforts&quot;, Don&#39;t group people who are too different together. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;A dormitory relationship intervention experiment&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Wang Qing, a lecturer at the School of Humanities at Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics, once tried to find a set of methods for running-in university dormitory relationships through his own experiments. Methodology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Qing has served as the head teacher for five years since 2016, and has actively or passively intervened in many dormitory conflicts. Some students asked her for help privately: They had a bad relationship with someone in the dormitory, which caused a lot of trouble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before 2023, Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics will allocate dormitories randomly within classes. In 2020, Wang Qing decided to select a part of the dormitory and artificially interfere with the direction of dormitory relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning, considering that there were many female students in the College of Humanities, Wang Qing decided to start with the female college dormitories. She selected 38 freshmen girls from four classes, and organized a group activity of &quot;making love together&quot; once a month after enrolling in the dormitory, a total of three times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, it was discovered that the conflicts in the boys’ dormitories were more serious, but they were not good at asking for help. Wang Qing learned from research that the physical conflict rate in boys&#39; dormitories is higher, and the degree of intimacy and integration and satisfaction with interpersonal relationships in the dormitories are also lower than those in girls&#39; dormitories. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The theme of the activity is related to the mechanism of dormitory relations. Wang Qing analyzed that dormitories are spaces where public and private attributes are mixed, where individuals eat and sleep, but where strangers live together. In such a space, students need to learn how to grasp the scale - what is the place where individuals can play, and where is the place where others should be respected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The theme of the first event is public order. Wang Qing simulated a scene: At 11 o&#39;clock in the evening, you are very tired and want to sleep, so you close your eyes. Your roommate is anxiously catching up on homework and typing on the computer. Wang Qing hopes that through empathy, the dormitory group can form the first agreement: strictly abide by the work and rest system and not interfere with others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To this end, she developed a 27-page intervention manual, which planned the process of each activity and mentioned common dormitory crises such as &quot;small groups&quot;. She tried to guide students to think about how to solve these situations when they happened in their dormitories. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the three activities, the students’ feedback achieved the results she expected. They underwent two tests to compare the development of the quality of interpersonal relationships in the dormitory before and after the event. The survey included tense situations such as cold wars and verbal conflicts, as well as collective activities and emotional exchanges within the dormitory. The students were also asked what they thought about the situation. How satisfied are you with the dormitory relationship, and whether you want to apply for a dormitory change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another 36 female college students who had not participated in the activities also accepted this test. Comparing the two, Wang Qing concluded that appropriate communication intervention can indeed eliminate interpersonal conflicts and alienation in advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After 2020, Wang Qing will no longer serve as the head teacher. Ru Jingfei, who has been a counselor for seven years and has tutored more than 1,200 students, has discovered that there are more and more dormitory conflicts among college students, and they tend to break out in lower grades. She was once called to the student dormitory in the middle of the night to deal with a fight. &quot;If you can, just mediate. If it doesn&#39;t work, you have to change (dormitory).&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Qing introduced that at present, China’s intervention against conflicts in college student dormitories generally focuses on post-event repair and remediation. From the perspective of school management, some dormitories with poor relations can be regularly selected for intervention. However, Wang Qing also knows very well that as time goes by, the effect of the original intervention will become weaker and weaker. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One reason is that the concepts, psychology and behavioral logic of the new generation of students are changing. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Lying talk sessions have become a legend&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In today’s school administrators’ vision, intervention in dormitory allocation can avoid some foreseeable conflicts earlier. . A survey of 3,875 college students across the country by Shanghai Ocean University showed that the main reasons why students are dissatisfied with dormitory relationships are work and rest habits, personal hygiene, introversion/extroversion personality, and whether to play games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, intervening in dormitory allocation is not a one-time solution. Ru Jingfei believes that even if the allocation method has been optimized, it can only solve superficial conflicts such as work and rest. She and other counselors often discuss that students’ self-awareness has become stronger and they are exposed to more information, which has brought about changes in dormitory relationships. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When chatting with Wang Qing, a counselor said that students born in the 1970s and 1980s would think that roommates may be very important partners in life. They have a great influence not only during the study period, but also after graduation. Later, it can also become a boost for emotional and career growth. But now, many children have very clear goals after entering college: enrolling in graduate school, going abroad... From the beginning of their freshman year, they will arrange their lives according to their goals, and will not participate in group activities such as dinner parties. The dormitory may just be their own resting place. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Digitalization is also exacerbating this individual loneliness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Wang Qing went to college about 20 years ago, mobile phones were only used for making calls and sending text messages. A very important dormitory activity at that time was sleeping in bed after lights out. “Nowadays, many children actually don’t have beds. Talk, everyone is very busy, mobile phones can meet many needs, and the connection, intimacy and integration between people will be reduced a lot.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Psychology Center of Beijing University of Chemical Technology reported in 2019 The school conducted a survey among 400 students. More than 80% of the students believed that the relationship in the dormitory was harmonious, but nearly half admitted that there were frictions in getting along. When asked to describe the relationship in the dormitory in one sentence, 40% chose &quot;like family&quot;, while more people chose &quot;ordinary friends&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Qing, who is no longer the head teacher, is still worried about the situation of the students. &quot;(dormitory conflicts) occur every year, so I think this is not an accidental problem. A large part of the group will have such problems during their studies.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Jiahui is also not sure about the effect of dormitory allocation. She plans to verify the effect of dormitory allocation in mid-September and conduct an offline or online anonymous survey on freshmen who are willing to be interviewed to ask them how they get along with their roommates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some more acute problems cannot be avoided by dormitory allocation. Wang Qing gave an example. For example, if two people in the dormitory happen to be two candidates for the scholarship, they may have potential conflicts of interest. In addition, professional views, conduct, etc. may also cause conflicts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Qing wrote the 2020 experiment in the article &quot;Analysis of the Intervention Effect of Intervention on Interpersonal Relationships in Female College Students&#39; Dormitories&quot;. In the article, she concluded: The quality of interpersonal relationships in college students&#39; dormitories is the highest at the beginning of getting along, and will be followed later. progressively worse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What a student said to Wang Qing left a deep impression on her: &quot;My roommate is not my friend, we just live together.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 22:55:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[发明了火药的中国，为何明清时火器技术落后了？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257188]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-20 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Gunpowder is one of the four great inventions in ancient China, but there are also some controversies surrounding gunpowder. For example, Lu Xun said &quot;Foreign countries use Gunpowder is used to make bullets to defend enemies, but China uses it to make firecrackers to worship gods.&quot; Another example is that in recent years, some people on the Internet have claimed that yellow gunpowder invented by Europeans in the 19th century is the real gunpowder. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These two statements are debatable. After China discovered gunpowder, it was used to make various firearms for use on the battlefield. The world moved from the Middle Ages to modern times, and the entire process relied on black gunpowder. Yellow gunpowder greatly accelerated this process in the late modern period, but the significance of black gunpowder cannot be ignored, and without black gunpowder as the basis, Europeans would not have been able to invent yellow gunpowder. gunpowder. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The huge potential of Chinese firearms&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Gunpowder first appeared in Taoist priests&#39; alchemy furnaces and was used as medicine. Ancient medicine believed that saltpeter can cure internal heat and stomach bloating, and sulfur can &quot;convert gold, silver, copper and iron&quot;. The two together are a kind of medicine for treating diseases, so they are called gunpowder. &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot; believes that &quot;gunpowder can expel insects and ward off evil spirits.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Synopsis of the True Yuan Miao Dao&quot;, written in the mid-Tang Dynasty, records the power of the earliest gunpowder. Burning saltpeter, sulfur, realgar and honey together can cause deflagration and quickly burn the house clean. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the invention of gunpowder, it was quickly used on the battlefield. Some people used &quot;flying fire&quot; in the melee between warlords in the late Tang Dynasty. The &quot;Wu Jing Zong Yao&quot; of the Northern Song Dynasty recorded the formula of gunpowder at that time. The saltpeter content used in the explosion was very low, but the content of various combustion accelerants such as oil, rosin, and asphalt was very high. This shows the role of gunpowder in war at this time. It was an incendiary bomb rather than a bomb or bullet. In addition, the gunpowder at this time was sometimes added with arsenic to burn it and poison the enemy. It can be said to be the earliest chemical weapon in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Throughout the Tang Dynasty and Northern Song Dynasty, Chinese gunpowder was often used to make incendiary weapons, such as gunpowder arrows, fire caltrops, fire poles, poison smoke balls, and artillery (cannon stones coated with gunpowder and thrown by catapults) etc., are all incendiary firearms. Among them, the gunpowder arrow developed by Feng Jisheng in the early Song Dynasty used the recoil of burning gunpowder to push the arrow. It can be said to be the prototype of today&#39;s rocket. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in terms of technical content and effectiveness, these firearms did not surpass those of their contemporaries in Europe. In 678 AD, when the Eastern Roman Empire faced a siege of 200,000 troops from the Arab Empire, it used copper pipes to spray &quot;Greek fire&quot; to burn enemy ships and annihilate the huge Arab navy. The formula of &quot;Greek Fire&quot; has been lost, but it should be a petroleum-based compound that can burn on the water surface and is extremely powerful when combined with mechanical spray. &quot;Greek Fire&quot; has long since become a secret weapon guarding the sea of ​​Constantinople. Many powerful enemies were defeated by &quot;Greek Fire&quot; and were helpless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the era of confrontation between the Song and Jin Dynasties, due to frequent wars between the Song and Jin Dynasties, both sides invented new firearms to assist in combat, and Chinese firearms achieved great development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song general Chen Gui invented the musket. Although its function was closer to a flamethrower than a firearm at this time, the design of the tubular bamboo tube prepared the conditions for the firearm; Song general Wei Sheng invented the &quot;Ruyi Zhan&quot; for installing muskets. &quot;Car&quot;, pulled by animal power. In the Southern Song Dynasty, all warships were equipped with trebuchets that threw artillery (incendiary bombs). When Wanyan Liang invaded the Song Dynasty, the Song general Li Bao led the navy to surprise the Jin army&#39;s naval base Chenjia Island, using rockets, artillery, etc. to burn Firearms completely annihilated the huge Jin Army naval division. It can be said that China&#39;s water warfare weapons have reached the level of &quot;Greek fire&quot; at this time. The Southern Song Dynasty gunboats can be regarded as the earliest gunboats in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Jin people invented the world&#39;s earliest artillery - iron artillery for sieges; flying muskets that burned better than bamboo pole muskets, which can be called individual flamethrowers; and iron cans for storing gunpowder. The sky-shattering thunder made was ignited and thrown out. The sound was scary, and the exploded iron can fragments spattered damage to the surroundings. It can be said to be the earliest bomb in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the Song-Mongolian War, the Song Dynasty invented the earliest firearm - the bamboo musket, which fired bullets to kill the enemy as far as 150 steps. In the Yuan Dynasty, the musket was Bamboo was changed to metal, and metal fire guns were created. By the end of the Yuan Dynasty, they had become popular in the military. However, until the early Yuan Dynasty, China&#39;s firearms were still mainly incendiary firearms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the Southern Song Dynasty to the Yuan Dynasty, Chinese firearms basically cover all categories of thermal weapons still in use until modern times. However, the Islamic world quickly learned various categories of Chinese firearms, and was even better in research and development. After being introduced to Europe, European firearms developed rapidly, leaving the rest of the world far behind. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Middle East and Europe came from behind&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Song Dynasty was the golden age of trade and cultural exchanges between China and the Islamic world. Many Arabs, Persians, and Central Asians settled in China and were even employed by the Song Dynasty. army, who quickly spread their knowledge of gunpowder and firearms back to Arabia. In addition, the Mongolians widely used firearms against the Islamic world during their Western Expeditions, which also promoted their learning of firearms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1240, the botanist Ibn Beytar of Al-Andalus (now southern Spain) introduced Chinese saltpeter in his book &quot;Medical Prescriptions&quot; and called it &quot;Chinese snow salt&quot;. &quot;Fire and saltpeter&quot; introduced its deflagration properties. In 1256, Kublai Khan&#39;s brother Hulagu established the Ilkhanate in Persia. Hassan Rahman, a Syrian who served in the Ilkhanate, wrote a military book &quot;Equestrianism and War Strategies&quot;, which introduced China in detail. Firearms, gunpowder formulas and saltpeter purification technologies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;West Asia and North Africa were originally rich in sulfur, but they did not know the use of nitrate, so they failed to invent gunpowder. Once they knew how to synthesize gunpowder, firearms developed rapidly in the Islamic world. The Mamluk dynasty that ruled Egypt created a new type of firearm &quot;Madafa&quot; based on the musket. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Motor Method&quot; replaced the Chinese bamboo gun barrel with a larger wooden barrel, and replaced the Chinese projectiles with stone balls. In fact, it transformed the musket into the prototype of modern artillery; there is also a The method of loading arrows in wooden tubes and using gunpowder to push iron arrows to attack may come from the tradition of crossbows in the Mediterranean region. Later, the earliest artillery in Europe also used iron arrows to attack, and it was probably influenced by this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The motor method is actually superior to the firearms of the Yuan Dynasty and the Mongol Khanates. Moreover, the Arabs in the Middle Ages liked to experiment. The chemistry derived from alchemy was very outstanding, and the purification of gunpowder was also better than that of China. It can be said that they are catching up from behind. In other words, in the future, Europeans will learn firearms from the Islamic world from a higher starting point than China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The earliest document recording firearms in Europe is the coronation address written by the Bishop of London for King Edward III in 1326. Below the coronation address is a picture of a bottle-shaped cannon, which uses gunpowder to shoot giant arrows. In Europe, the Italian city-states who were constantly striving for hegemony were the first to master the manufacturing technology of firearms. Later, firearms were also mastered by Britain, France and Germany, and they showed great glory in the Hundred Years&#39; War between England and France. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was during the Hundred Years War that European artillery shifted its goal from killing people to siegeing cities. Europeans began to build huge cannons that could collapse city walls, and built larger and larger cannons in the competition. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1375, French cannon makers cast a huge cannon weighing 2,000 pounds (about 900 kilograms) in Caen. Two years later, Philip the Brave, King of Burgundy, blasted it with a huge cannon. He defeated the British at Alderac Castle and proved the value of the cannon. In the second half of the Hundred Years&#39; War, King Henry V of England used huge artillery to capture dozens of castles in France. Later, King Charles VII of France established the most efficient artillery in Europe, sweeping across the British army and recovering more than half of the country occupied by the British. France. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Europeans installed this kind of giant cannon on ships. In the Age of Discovery, they were invincible. Vasco da Gama led a few gunboats to travel across East Africa and India, equipped with dozens of giant cannons. The ships can often easily defeat enemies several times, ten times or even dozens of times larger. During the colonial expansion, the Europeans built bastions and deployed huge cannons in the colonies, which frightened thousands of indigenous troops and left them helpless. Europeans easily gained control of the entire world&#39;s seas through gunboats and fortresses, and dominated modern history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The artillery from Western Europe also returned to Eastern Europe. The Russians used advanced guns and artillery to blow up the Mongolian khanates and advance rapidly toward the east. The Islamic world also introduced advanced firearms from Western Europe, and three gunpowder empires emerged, including the Ottoman Empire, the Safavid Empire of Persia, and the Mughal Empire of India. Even Central Asia, which was relatively isolated in modern times, had self-made weapons because of the teachings of the Ottoman Empire. Arquebus and light artillery capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1453, the Ottoman Sultan Mehmet II captured Constantinople and eliminated the Byzantine Empire. The exaggerated Urban cannon played a major role, and the Sudanese pro-army Yeniceri was also an excellent force. Musket Army. In 1526, Babur, the relic of the Timur Empire, marched into India. In the Battle of Panipat, he used artillery to defeat the elephant soldiers of the Delhi Sultanate. He entered India and established the Mughal Empire. Later, the Mughal Empire set up a cannon factory. , a standing army with 70 guns. Due to poor road conditions, it was difficult for Persia to use giant cannons, and the use of firearms lagged behind. However, in the early 18th century, Nader Shah, who replaced the Safavid dynasty, used advanced muskets imported from Europe and camel-borne Wasp cannons to sweep through Persia and India. , Central Asia, defeated the Ottoman army many times, and became the last great conqueror in history. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The system of the Ming and Qing Dynasties brought the glory of Chinese firearms to an end&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;While firearms are advancing rapidly around the world, China, which invented firearms, has been left behind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty was amazed by the performance of the Dzungar firearm &quot;Zanbalak&quot;. During the reign of Emperor Yongzheng, he copied it on a large scale and equipped it for the Qing army, which later developed into a gun. This kind of &quot;Zanbarak&quot; is a camel-borne wasp cannon, but it is an outdated weapon invented by the Mamluk Dynasty three to four hundred years before Emperor Kangxi. Although it is still somewhat unique in the geographical environment of Persia and Central Asia, Function, but it is several eras behind the advanced artillery in Western Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The firearms in the Middle East and Europe overtook China in the Yuan Dynasty, mainly because the intensity of the war at that time was not high, and there was no need to improve firearms like the Europeans who fought every day. At the end of the Yuan Dynasty, the uprising army revived firearms. However, the firearms of Zhu Yuanzhang and other heroes in the late Yuan Dynasty all followed the path of weight rather than quality. Although the Ming army&#39;s firepower equipment rate reached 10% during the Hongwu period, with hundreds of thousands of firepower soldiers, the level of firearms may not reach the level of the Song Dynasty, let alone compare with Europe at the same time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Zhu Yuanzhang fought against Chen Youliang at Poyang Lake, the &quot;big bowl mouth barrel&quot; he used was an anti-personnel shotgun, the &quot;no help&quot; was an incendiary bomb, and the so-called &quot;artillery&quot; was a trebuchet to throw incendiary bombs. Burn enemy warships. When attacking Zhang Shicheng&#39;s last stronghold in Suzhou, Zhu Yuanzhang used catapults instead of cannons to attack the city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that in the use of firearms in the troubled times of the late Yuan Dynasty, the transformation of European firearms into giant cannons was not seen. American sinologist Ouyang Tai believes that this is because China&#39;s rammed earth city walls are too thick to be destroyed by giant cannons, so there is no need to build giant cannons. However, Zhu Yuanzhang always used catapults that were much less powerful than giant cannons when he attacked the city. It can be seen that siege equipment does not necessarily rush to destroy the city wall, and there is no reason to give up the development of giant cannons. It should be because the overall technical level of Zhu Yuanzhang&#39;s army is too low and they cannot build them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After seizing the world, Zhu Yuanzhang closed the country on the one hand and suppressed the people who killed the soldiers on the other. This resulted in a gap in knowledge and technology, and many technologies may have been lost as a result. Although the Ming army has a high firearms equipment rate, the Ming Dynasty has strictly prohibited private ownership and research and development of firearms since the founding of the country. Local governments cannot make their own firearms and must uniformly deploy them through the court, thus eliminating the possibility of society improving firearms on its own. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the above reasons, the firearms of the Ming Dynasty were very backward. In the middle period, when the Portuguese appeared on the southeastern coast, their pre-loaded eagle cannons that could be fired continuously were regarded as artifacts by the Ming army. They called them &quot;Flan cannons&quot; and copied them. However, this kind of cannon was not popular in Europe at that time. It is already outdated and second-rate. Later, the ordinary naval guns of the Dutch became the &quot;Red Yi cannons&quot; used by the Ming army to save lives in the war with the Jianzhou Jurchens. The first ones the Ming army fished from sunken ships were fished from the sea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even the Ottoman Empire muskets, whose performance was obviously inferior to that of Europe, were modified by the Ming Dynasty Zhao Shizhen into the &quot;Rumi gun&quot; (Rumi means Rome, and the Ottomans regarded themselves as Rome), which was regarded as a sharp weapon. It can be seen that the Ming Dynasty The level of firearms is low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Jurchens suffered continuously under the Ming army&#39;s Hongyi artillery, they developed artillery on their own. With the guidance of the surrendered Ming army artillery team and European missionaries, their artillery use once led East Asia. However, as the Manchus learned from the Ming Dynasty and turned to isolation, these welcome changes gradually faded away. In 1724, Emperor Yongzheng expelled missionaries, and the Manchu Qing Dynasty&#39;s introduction of Western technology slowed down significantly. In 1776, after Emperor Qianlong pacified Jinchuan and Jinchuan, he achieved perfect martial arts and believed that there would be no trouble at home. In order to prevent firearms from flowing into the people, he destroyed a large number of firearms caught in the war. Made firearms, the pace of China&#39;s firearms innovation came to an abrupt end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some overseas sinologists believe that China&#39;s unified system does not have as many wars as Europe, which is the biggest reason for the sluggish development of firearms in China. However, in fact, during the Ming and Qing Dynasties, there were no wars to quell civil unrest and bring people back home. There were quite a few, some on a very large scale, but they did not promote the development of firearms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most important reason is that the Ming and Qing Dynasties reversed the enlightened attitude of the Tang and Song Dynasties and reached their peak in preventing social autocracy. They were the masters of the Qin system and tried to monopolize the most advanced firearms technology as far as the eye could see. Not only is it closed to the country, cutting off economic and technological exchanges with the West, but it is also unwilling to allow the private sector to promote the research and development and upgrading of firearms. Naturally, the entire society has no enthusiasm and motivation for researching firearms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the emperors of the Ming and Qing Dynasties felt that the dynasty was in a military crisis, they would also vigorously introduce advanced European firearms, which shows that they have the ability to learn advanced technology. If this continues, even if the research and development is poor, they will not lag behind Europe. is too big. But once the crisis has passed, it will cut off ties with overseas countries and ignore the booming development of firearms outside the region until the Europeans knock on the country&#39;s door with powerful ships and cannons that the Manchus could not imagine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[不只得一微，证监会系统离职人员为何扎堆IPO？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257196]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-20 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/20/IxjlclwEZfHBM4nqcCpIhyvliHeh3Kh4DvTA8tRH.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1268&quot; height=&quot;986&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/IxjlclwEZfHBM4nqcCpIhyvliHeh3Kh 4DvTA8tRH. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251287&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In April and May 2021, the China Securities Regulatory Commission issued documents and regulations to strengthen the system.

This new property market policy has the characteristics of large intensity and wide scope, striving to promote the transformation and high-quality development of the city&#39;s real estate market in an orderly and effective manner. At the same time, the &quot;Notice&quot; aims to implement classified and precise policies, continue to increase the construction and supply of affordable housing, better meet residents&#39; rigid and improved housing needs, and resolutely curb speculation and speculation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, in the critical period of structural adjustment of the real estate industry, Guangzhou City actively responds to and implements the national real estate macro-control policy. In recent days, Guangzhou has taken the lead in implementing the &quot;recognize the house but not the loan&quot; policy in the first-tier cities. Mortgage interest rates were the first to break through the lower limit of LPR. This time, Guangzhou still took the lead among first-tier cities and opened up a new development situation in the real estate industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Notice&quot; mainly includes three parts: including relaxing purchase restrictions in some areas, relaxing the qualifications for non-household registered persons to purchase houses, and adjusting the value-added tax exemption period for personal sales of housing from 5 years to 2 years, etc., and many measures. At the same time, we will promote the recovery of the real estate market. In addition, yesterday, the Guangzhou Municipal Bureau of Housing and Urban-Rural Development issued the &quot;Notice of the General Office of the Guangzhou Municipal People&#39;s Government on Further Strengthening Housing Security for Household Registration Households (Draft for Comments)&quot;, which will jointly improve Guangzhou&#39;s &quot;rental and purchase&quot; housing security. mechanism. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;New Deal Questions and Answers&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Q: What are the specific purchase restriction and non-purchase restriction areas in Guangzhou City in the future? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Answer: The &quot;Notice&quot; states that households registered in Guangzhou are located in Yuexiu, Haizhu, Liwan, Tianhe, and Baiyun (excluding Jianggao Town, Taihe Town, Renhe Town, and Zhongluotan Town), Nansha and other areas still limit the purchase of two houses. This means that except for the areas mentioned above, purchase restrictions are no longer set in other areas of Guangzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Q: Can families who are not residents registered in this city enjoy the liberalized regional dividend? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Answer: The &quot;Notice&quot; clearly states that non-local resident households are limited to purchasing one house in the above-mentioned areas. The conditions for purchasing a house are that they must have paid continuous personal income tax payment certificates or social insurance certificates for 2 years in Guangzhou before the date of purchase. Year. Previously, non-registered residents in Guangzhou were required to meet proof of continuous payment of personal income tax or social insurance certificate for five years to purchase a house in Guangzhou. This new policy lowers the threshold for non-registered residents to purchase houses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the &quot;Notice&quot; stipulates that in addition to calculations based on family units, adult single (including divorced) people with household registration in this city in Yuexiu, Haizhu, Liwan, Tianhe, Baiyun (excluding Jianggao Town, Taiyuan) Hezhen, Renhe Town, and Zhongluotan Town) are still limited to purchasing one house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Q: Will the new policy have any impact on foreigners purchasing houses in Guangzhou? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Answer: Overseas institutions and individuals purchase houses in accordance with the &quot;Opinions on Regulating the Access and Management of Foreign Investment in the Real Estate Market&quot; (Jianfanghuang [2006] No. 171), the &quot;Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development and other departments on the adjustment of foreign investment in the real estate market&quot; &quot;Notice on Relevant Policies for Access and Management&quot; (Jianfang [2015] No. 122) is implemented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Q: After the issuance of this &quot;Notice&quot;, what will be the timetable for policy implementation? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Answer: The policy adjustment will be implemented from 0:00 on September 20, 2023. If the applicable policy for house purchase qualification review is inconsistent with this notice, this notice shall prevail. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Q: The value-added tax exemption period for personal housing sales has been reduced from 5 years to 2 years. How to implement it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Answer: The value-added tax exemption period for individual sales of housing in Yuexiu, Haizhu, Liwan, Tianhe, Baiyun, Huangpu, Panyu, Nansha, Zengcheng and other districts will be adjusted from 5 years to 2 years. The applicable determination of the policy is based on The specific review opinions of the tax department shall prevail. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Q: Does the issuance of the &quot;Notice&quot; mean that Guangzhou will realize that everyone has a place to live in the future, and the commercial housing market will be more dominated? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Answer: Guangzhou City has always adhered to the housing security system of &quot;both renting and purchasing&quot;. During the &quot;14th Five-Year Plan&quot; period, Guangzhou City proposed to add 660,000 units (rooms) of affordable housing, which is higher than The number of newly added commercial houses (650,000 units) during the same period made it the city with the largest supply of affordable housing among first-tier cities in the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relevant departments of the Guangzhou Municipal Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau introduced that next, the city will further increase the construction and supply of affordable housing, and accelerate the establishment and improvement of public rental housing, affordable rental housing and allotment of affordable housing. A housing security system with housing as the mainstay and both renting and purchasing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, we will continue to provide basic guarantees for public rental housing, raise the income threshold and rental subsidy standards for public rental housing in a timely manner, further expand the scope of public rental housing security, and guide some security targets to solve their housing problems by receiving subsidies. Difficult issues and improve public rental housing security methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Vigorously developing affordable rental housing will provide policy support for land, finance, taxation, etc. from the government, and guide various market entities to participate in raising affordable rental housing to alleviate the housing difficulties of new citizens and young people. Accelerate the establishment and improvement of supporting policy systems for allotment of affordable housing. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;[Voice]&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In response to this new policy in Guangzhou’s real estate market, Southern+ reporters immediately contacted experts to explain what impact it will have on the city’s real estate industry in the subsequent stages after the new policy is released. ? Hear what the experts have to say. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ou Jiangbo, director of the Economic Research Institute of the Guangzhou Academy of Social Sciences and deputy director of the Expert Committee of the Guangzhou and Guangdong Real Estate Association:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This adjustment and optimization of real estate development policies is very necessary. And importantly, it will play a very good role in boosting and promoting the real estate market and economic and social development of Guangzhou. Mainly reflected in the following three aspects:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1. Conducive to the stable and healthy development of Guangzhou’s real estate market&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In view of the huge changes in the development environment at home and abroad and the lagging impact of the three-year epidemic, the current real estate market There is indeed great downward pressure on the market and the macroeconomy, and relevant policies are in great need to be adjusted and optimized. The policies introduced in the early stage, such as &quot;recognizing a house but not a loan&quot; and &quot;lowering interest rates and lowering down payments,&quot; are generally indirect and mild, and the policy strength and effect are not enough. The relaxation of the &quot;purchase restriction and foreign purchase restriction&quot; policy introduced this time is a relaxation of administrative control policies. It is direct, substantive, very important, necessary and timely. I believe it will definitely boost and promote the market. effect. As a national central city and a first-tier city, the steady and healthy development of Guangzhou&#39;s real estate market will also serve as a good example and driving role for other second-, third-, and fourth-tier cities in the country. Therefore, Guangzhou’s policy optimization and adjustment this time is of great significance and deserves high recognition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2. Conducive to the coordinated and balanced development of the real estate market and housing security&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that this policy optimization and adjustment not only optimizes and adjusts the real estate market policy, but also further strengthens the The safeguard policy emphasizes the proper separation, balanced efforts, and mutual promotion of the market and safeguards. It clarifies fuzzy thinking conceptually and strengthens the direction and intensity of work in action, which is conducive to making the market bigger, stronger, and better, as well as better safeguards. It is conducive to the high-quality coordinated development of real estate, economy and society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;3. It is conducive to the coordinated and integrated development between various districts in Guangzhou and between Guangzhou and surrounding areas&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This policy optimization and adjustment is mainly aimed at the peripheral areas of Guangzhou, while the central urban area and Nansha District are still The implementation of relatively strict purchase restriction measures fully considers the actual conditions of industry, population and real estate market in each district, which well reflects the principle of &quot;district-specific policies&quot; and is conducive to better coordinated development among various districts in Guangzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, with the strong implementation of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area plan, the integration of the Greater Bay Area is accelerating. Currently, more than 50% of the working population in Guangzhou is non-locally registered. Guangzhou is a very open city. , a dynamic city, the appropriate relaxation of policies such as &quot;purchase restrictions and foreign purchase restrictions&quot; fully meets the objective needs of the integrated development of the Greater Bay Area. This optimization and adjustment of real estate policies will not only have great significance in promoting real estate in Guangzhou, but also be of great benefit to the long-term economic, spatial and social development of Guangzhou and the Greater Bay Area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 19:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[悬疑推理作家访谈录丨法医秦明：真正高智商的人不会犯罪]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257192]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-20 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Among contemporary Chinese writers of detective novels, &quot;Forensic Physician Qin Ming&quot; is a very unique existence. On the one hand, there are actually many contemporary writers with police work experience, such as Remy, Ah Yi, etc., but authors like Qin Ming who combine their work experience and professional skills with detective novel writing so closely can be called &quot; Unparalleled.&quot; On the other hand, if &quot;Forensic Qin Ming&quot; is regarded as a cultural phenomenon in a broader sense, it started from novels, and later gradually extended to different cultural forms such as film and television, variety shows, and even became the profession of &quot;forensic medicine&quot; in many people&#39;s minds. synonym. Among them, the intertwining of the forensic profession and literary creation has created an amazing cultural communication power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/c7tnNmyPxBgUYScX14uWqfeo1s7mGgALr6L6XBT2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;656&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/c7tnNmyPxBgUYScX14uWqfeo1s7mGgALr6L6XBT2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251280&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Qin Ming is a front-line public security forensic doctor who has examined thousands of corpses for 26 years. He is also a suspense writer and has written the Forensic Qin Ming series, the Hummingbird series, the Night Watch series, and the popular science book series. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Yi/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a forensic doctor, I am full of awe and curiosity: why did he choose This career? After working in this somewhat mysterious profession for decades, how has your mentality changed? Faced with the large number of literature and film and television dramas about forensics or ghost stories today, what new perspectives can his profession provide? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have many questions about Qin Ming as a writer: How does he deal with the issues of fiction and reality in novel writing? How does he view the ethical boundaries of writing in crime novels? What is his reading tendency and self-identity towards the genre literary tradition of detective novels? And when I learned during the interview that Qin Ming’s favorite Chinese detective novel writer was Hai Yan, many of the questions I had previously had were solved, and a genealogy of the development of Chinese public security literature gradually became clear before my eyes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, in the latest novel &quot;White Scroll&quot;, we get to know Qin Ming as a father. Compared with the &quot;bad boy&quot; narrative that was popular in detective literature in previous years, &quot;White Scroll&quot; is about Qin Ming. The way children imagine the weak may be more traditional, but it is also more in line with the real concerns and anxieties of contemporary parents. In this novel, the forensic doctor is still the main body of action in the novel, but the father is more able to convey the author&#39;s inner voice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The chat with Qin Ming lasted less than two hours, but I felt a sense of solidity, trust and security on the other end of the phone. This may be due to the simplicity and sincerity revealed in his words and voice, or it may be due to his many years of professional experience in front-line police work. And during this chat, I also vaguely felt the possibility of another understanding of the sense of reality in the novel &quot;Forensic Qin Ming&quot;. This sense of reality does not lie in whether the story itself is &quot;purely fictional&quot;, but in a kind of Perseverance in writing attitude and inner belief in justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Forensic Medicine in Reality&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Qin Mingyou Well, since the publication of your first novel &quot;Corpse Whisperer&quot; in 2012, through the publication of more than a dozen novels, the adaptation of many film and television dramas, and now the very popular variety show &quot;Jobs -&quot; Forensic Season&quot;. Forensic medicine, which was originally a relatively niche and somewhat mysterious profession, has now gradually become well-known to the public. Why did you choose the profession of forensic medicine in the first place? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Qin Ming: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When I was in middle school, I basically didn’t know much about forensic medicine. My father was a policeman and my mother was a nurse. My father had a special interest in me. I had the complex and expectation that a son should inherit his father&#39;s career and become a police officer. However, my mother felt that being a police officer was too dangerous. Later, when I applied for a volunteer, I compromised and applied for a forensic medicine job. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When you take an anatomy class for the first time, What are the scenes and feelings like? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Qin Ming: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I went to college in 1998 and began to study in the professional field of forensic medicine. In the process of studying and working, I gradually realized the forensic medicine importance. For example, the first story in my novel &quot;The Corpse Whisperer&quot; tells the story of a fight between several young people, and one person was stabbed to death. It was originally a very simple case, but it required forensic identification of the tools that caused the injuries in order to accurately determine their respective legal responsibilities. The key point is that the deceased in this case was an acquaintance of mine, so it posed a great psychological challenge to me. This was my first anatomy class, and I was very impressed. I was deeply shocked by the importance of forensic work, and from then on I set my life ambition: I must be a good forensic doctor in my life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When you later engaged in forensic work, Will there be any changes in your mind? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Qin Ming: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;At first I would feel very angry with the criminal and hate the evil as much as I hate them. But the sign of a true maturity of a forensic doctor is his indifference. He will not pay too much attention to things other than the case. Instead, he will put all his energy on the autopsy and try his best to find clues. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;That is, as forensic doctors continue to accumulate work experience, Not only has the professional and technical level been improved, but also the entire personality has been tempered and changed. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Qin Ming: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think it should be like this. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Before, I thought forensic medicine was a type of doctor. The main task is to perform an autopsy. But through your novels and the &quot;Forensic Season&quot; program, I discovered that forensic doctors also have to undertake a lot of work in on-site investigation, physical evidence identification, and even case reasoning. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/ACJAPjfdzIYaZVxRhcxS9mLdD2WvZgY9LZ5lBvRy.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/ACJAPjfdzIYaZVxRhcxS9mLdD2WvZgY9LZ5lBvRy.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251281&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 2023, forensic doctor Qin Ming will participate in the reality show &quot;Forensic Medicine Season 2&quot; as a guest. The picture shows the poster of the show. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Qin Ming:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, our Chinese public security organs have set up As a forensic department, public security forensic doctors must participate in case scene investigation and case investigation. In some Western countries, forensic doctors, as independent inspection agencies, usually only need to identify three pieces of information: cause of death, time of death, and instrument of injury, and generally will not express opinions on other than these three issues. However, in our investigation process, all police types must play their maximum role within their professional scope, so that they can solve the case most efficiently. We often say that the center of a murder scene is the corpse, and the forensic doctor is the only police officer who comes into contact with the corpse, so the forensic doctor will have the core information of the entire scene. Therefore, our forensic doctors often have to participate in more case analysis and reasoning processes. This also ensures that our various police departments work together as a whole to maximize the effectiveness of the team and solve cases with the highest efficiency. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I wrote a story in my book about the murder of a family of five. The murderer used knives to kill the host and hostess, the host’s mother, nanny and children. The five bodies were all covered with knives. The injuries were fatal. Only the nanny and the old lady&#39;s heads still had scars from the hammer, and they were still injured after death. When encountering such a case, many Western forensic institutions will feel that the cause of death, time of death, and the instrument of injury are very clear when conducting examinations, and will not proceed to the next step of reasoning. But our forensic doctors will continue to reason based on these clues: Why did the murderer hit these two people&#39;s heads with a hammer after they died? The biggest possibility is that it is reinforced damage, just to ensure that the deceased will die, and if she is not dead, she will be hit twice. So under what circumstances would reinforced damage be used? That means the deceased knew the murderer. So why only use reinforced damage on old ladies and nannies? It means that only two of them in the family of five know the murderer, and no other family members know him. Who could the murderer be? We speculated that he might be a vegetable vendor in the market, who usually only has contact with old ladies and nannies. As a result, we greatly reduced the scope of investigation and improved the police&#39;s efficiency in solving crimes. Therefore, I say that allowing forensic doctors to be more involved in the entire process of investigation, reasoning and solving cases is actually an institutional arrangement that is more suitable for our country&#39;s national conditions and can greatly improve the efficiency of solving cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What a wonderful reasoning. In many other current criminal investigation dramas, suspense films, or mystery novels, the role of forensic doctors is also set up, and they are given important functions in solving crimes. However, most of the forensic characters in these film and television dramas or novels are women - such as the female forensic doctor Gao Yanan in the TV series &quot;White Night&quot; (2017), and the female forensic doctor in Hu Yanyun&#39;s novel &quot;Sweeping Rat Ridge&quot; (2020). Forensic doctor Lei Rong et al. I wonder what the gender ratio is between men and women in the real forensic profession? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Qin Ming: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Movies and TV dramas may be based on dramatic considerations, so many female forensic roles are set up. However, in the actual gender composition of the profession, the majority of forensic doctors are men. The ratio of men to women in Anhui Province is about 10:1. The advantage of men engaging in forensic medicine may be that many autopsies are actually laborious work, and sometimes they need to go to the remote mountains and forests in the middle of the night. But female forensic doctors also have their own advantages. For example, they are often more meticulous and can handle some details better. At the same time, a lot of the work of forensic doctors is to assess injuries. When it comes to female injured people, female forensic doctors also have their own conveniences. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When it comes to forensic-themed film and television dramas, in addition to urban themes In addition, the profession of forensic medicine is now increasingly entering the public eye, which in turn has led to the popularity of another type of film and television dramas, which are works with ancient ghosts or autopsy personnel as the protagonists. From the early &quot;The Punisher of the Song Dynasty&quot; (2005) to the recent &quot;The Imperial Gift of Xiaowu&quot; (2021), even Gongsun Ce, who was beside Bao Zheng, had to some extent the ability to perform autopsies. In my opinion, this is actually using some modern forensic technology and spirit to reimagine an ancient puppeteer. Do you usually watch these film and television works? What do you think of these works? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Qin Ming: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;As you said, the essence of the &quot;criminal officials&quot; or &quot;husbands&quot; in these ancient film and television dramas is still based on modern Artistic image processing performed by forensic medicine. To give two examples, one is that according to ancient customs, in most cases corpses cannot be dissected, and the case can only be concluded through autopsy. Of course, for many cases, autopsy can also roughly clarify the basic situation of the case. Unless there are doubts that cannot be resolved by autopsy, the body can be dissected. Another is that the ancient corpses only had the function of cleaning and moving corpses, but did not have the function of identification. Only officials are qualified to conduct autopsies and identifications. In the ancient status hierarchy, wu Zuo was often a pariah and did not have such qualifications. He did not even have the right to fill in the autopsy records, while our modern forensic doctors have the right to identify. So the two costume dramas you mentioned are actually quite different. Song Ci in &quot;The Punishment Officer of the Great Song Dynasty&quot; is a Tidian criminal prosecutor of the fourth rank, while the protagonist in &quot;The Imperial Gift of Xiaowu Zuo&quot; is a Xiaowu Zuo.

But on the other hand, in daily life, forensic doctors will also encounter some misunderstandings and discrimination. For example, after some people know that I am a forensic doctor, they are unwilling to shake my hand or eat at the same table with me, thinking that it is bad luck. Within the public security system, forensic medicine as a police force also needs to be paid more attention to and valued. We often tend to see the police who finally arrest the criminals, but tend to ignore the forensic doctors who are behind the scenes and have done a lot of identification and reasoning work. At the same time, I also write novels to popularize some basic forensic knowledge, so that when a case does occur, netizens will have better forensic literacy and will not be easily deceived by rumors. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/IbzSDdVqLa25EXgvR7DppuaXEGEgG2ooKfVooyjB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 640&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/IbzSDdVqLa25EXgvR7DppuaXEGEgG2ooKfVooyjB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251282&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Forensic doctor Qin Ming. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(ELLE Magazine/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;It is equivalent to obtaining correct forensic knowledge, which in some cases improves the ability to identify rumors. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Qin Ming: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, at the same time, I also hope to deter crime. Someone asked me before, aren&#39;t you worried that readers will commit crimes after reading your novels? I said I&#39;m not afraid. I don&#39;t write novels to attract attention, but I hope my readers will understand after reading my novels that we have the most professional forensics and the highest detection rate. Here &quot;if you commit a crime, you will be caught.&quot; I hope that my novel can make kind people be more vigilant and make people with evil intentions put down their butcher knives. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Well, in fact, the creative attitude determines the specific way of writing the novel. are different, correspondingly, the final writing effect and reader impact will also be different. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Qin Ming: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, that’s right. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you think is society’s current understanding of forensic medicine? Is it getting better? Do you still feel the grievances you felt when you first wrote? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Qin Ming: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Now the public knows more and more about forensic medicine, and they are increasingly aware of the characteristics and greatness of the profession of forensic medicine. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The &quot;Forensic Qin Ming&quot; series of novels is particularly touching. What’s great about it is the sense of reality revealed in it, which is a reality derived from daily work experience. For example, in your novel, you talk about the details of the forensic doctor shaving the hair of the dead body. The scalpel must be used to shave the hair cleanly without damaging the scalp. At first glance, it is a detail that can only be written by a professional. So why did you initially choose the fictional literary form of novels? Have you ever considered writing non-fiction documentary works? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Qin Ming: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This involves some issues of writing ethics and case confidentiality. The novels I write are basically a combination of fiction and reality. Forensic work and reasoning are &quot;real&quot;, but the case itself is &quot;fictitious&quot;. I may have made up a case story, but the daily routine and core reasoning points of forensic work are all real and come from life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;This combination of virtuality and reality is also very interesting. Do you usually like to read detective novels? Who are your favorite detective novel writers and works? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Qin Ming: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;My favorite writer has not changed in so many years, it is Hai Yan, but to be precise, he does not write detective novels. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Well, actually Haiyan is in a broader sense It is written on the theme of public security and incorporates quite a few elements of romance novels into it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Qin Ming: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, he has an urban style. The first Hai Yan novel I read was &quot;Plain Clothes Police&quot;. The novel was written very early, but I only got into the trap after I went to college in 2000. Later, the second book was &quot;A Romantic Affair&quot;, as well as &quot;Death in Youth&quot;, &quot;Jade Guanyin&quot; and &quot;Deep Prison&quot;, including the later &quot;Dancer&quot; and &quot;Chang&#39;an Robbers&quot;, which I bought immediately. Among those who came here to read, I liked the book &quot;Deep Prison&quot; the most. Later, Jiao Junyan went to star in the movie &quot;The Bandits of Chang&#39;an&quot;. She was the heroine in my first online drama, and she was also from Anhui. We were very familiar with each other, so I was very excited when I heard that she was going to star in this movie adapted from Hai Yan&#39;s novel. . In addition to Hai Yan, I also read Remy&#39;s &quot;Psychological Crime&quot; series, Zhou Haohui&#39;s &quot;Death Notice&quot; series, including Ma Boyong&#39;s novels. I don&#39;t know if they are considered mystery novels, but I also like to read them. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I heard that you and Remy have some fun relationship experience? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Qin Ming: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Remy is a teacher at the Criminal Police Academy. I am a student at the Criminal Police Academy. I went to the Criminal Police Academy to study for a degree after graduating from university. Double bachelor, so even though Remi and I are about the same age, he did serve as my teacher. In addition, after I finished writing my first novel and sent it to him for reading, he made three suggestions that have impressed me to this day: first, please clarify the usage of &quot;的,地,得&quot;; second, read less novels of the same type, Continue to maintain your own style; third, be a writer who can write for a long time. I think I have basically implemented the three suggestions he made at the beginning. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What a very frank suggestion. Would you say that Remy&#39;s portraits of criminal psychology in Fang Mu are more fantasy and fiction, while your &quot;Forensic Qin Ming&quot; series is more realism? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Qin Ming: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I don’t think the character Fang Mu is completely fictional. On the one hand, criminal psychological profiling technology is very important in specific crime research and solving cases. It does exist in the process; on the other hand, I think Fang Mu may be a collection of many successful cases of outstanding public security officers, and it is not completely fictitious. In contrast, my &quot;Forensic Qin Ming&quot; series may be more convincing because forensic science is a natural science. I will explain scientific principles to you and come up with a conclusion to solve the case, which you think is credible. But psychological analysis is also based on science. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Erasing the footprints will leave more traces of wiping”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;If the &quot;Forensic Qin Ming&quot; series is also placed in the literary tradition of detective novels, since Conan Doyle&#39;s &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, detective Holmes actually has two skills : One is the meticulous on-site observation ability. Footprints, fingerprints, bloodstains, hair, soot, no detail will escape Holmes&#39;s eyes, and these can often constitute the key clues for his final solution of the case; the other is his ability to observe the scene in detail. Strong logical reasoning ability, as Holmes himself said: &quot;Logicians can deduce from a drop of water whether it comes from the Atlantic Ocean or Niagara Falls, without having to see or hear about the Atlantic Ocean or Niagara Falls. Life is a huge chain, as long as we see one link, we can infer the characteristics of the entire chain.&quot; If we look at the two literary traditions created by Sherlock Holmes novels, the &quot;Forensic Qin Ming&quot; series seems to have inherited and developed the A tradition, and combining that tradition with a very specific, modern profession, creates a certain sense of authenticity. What do you think of these two traditions of detective fiction? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Qin Ming: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think different writers have different writing emphases and concerns. People often ask me whether I am a conservative or a socialist. I say that I do not belong to either school because the things I write are not reasoning for the sake of reasoning, but reasoning for the purpose of solving crimes. If I have to summarize it, I think it can be called &quot;realistic reasoning.&quot; On the one hand, real physical evidence is the premise and basis for reasoning; on the other hand, the combination of physical evidence and reasoning has the ultimate goal of solving the case. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Nowadays, a very important branch of mystery novels It&#39;s &quot;secret room murder.&quot; In your &quot;Survivor&quot;, the fourth case is the &quot;Death Room&quot;. In &quot;White Scroll&quot;, the tenth case is also called &quot;The Heartbroken Chamber&quot;. Of course, I think the &quot;secret room&quot; mentioned in your novel is still very different from the concept of the &quot;secret room&quot; in current &quot;Xinbenge&quot; novels. What do you think of the secret room design in this mystery novel? If in &quot;new original style&quot; mystery novels, &quot;secret room&quot; often means a combination of some kind of wild imagination and rigorous logical reasoning, then in the eyes of forensic detectives, is it possible for a secret room to exist? Or will the so-called &quot;secret room&quot; definitely leave traces and clues deliberately forged by the murderer? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Qin Ming: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I am very touched, because you really understood the meaning of my novel. We often say that as long as someone appears at the crime scene, material exchange will occur. For example, if you set up a very complicated secret room, we usually call it a &quot;closed site&quot;. Can you not leave any traces? Many people say that just wiping off the footprints is enough, but wiping off the footprints will leave more traces of wiping. The more the suspect thinks about it and the more redundant actions he takes at the scene, the more clues and evidence he leaves for the police. Just like many people often ask me whether there are &quot;high IQ crimes&quot;, I say that truly high IQ people will not commit crimes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When it comes to &quot;high IQ crimes&quot;, I think of Zijin Chen’s novel, he has a novel called &quot;Undocumented Crime&quot;, in which there is a very interesting imagination, that is, the criminal is a top expert who is proficient in the two fields of forensics and forensics. When such a person commits a crime, there will be no scene at the scene. There will be some clues and evidence left. The detective who solved the case was a university mathematics teacher with super logical reasoning ability, so he formed a plot design in which the &quot;King of Reasoning&quot; solves the &quot;undocumented crime&quot;, which is somewhat similar to the peak showdown in traditional martial arts novels. What do you think of this type of literary imagination? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Qin Ming: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Different novelists have their own specialties and different ways of writing novels. I also like to read Zijin Chen’s novels. But our writing methods may be different. He is good at arranging reasoning, and my specialty is writing forensics. In my actual work, there is no &quot;crime without evidence&quot;. &quot;Undocumented&quot; means &quot;innocent&quot;. Only by finding evidence and forming a complete chain of evidence can a conviction be achieved, so my novel may focus more on evidence. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In your early novels, each story was They are relatively independent of each other, but the same group of forensic doctors connect these different cases and different short stories together. To a certain extent, it may be closer to a set of &quot;short story collections&quot; that are closely related to each other. You also said in the &quot;Preface&quot; to &quot;Survivor&quot; that one of the essences of the &quot;Forensic Qin Ming&quot; series is to &quot;based on individual cases and add the main thread that intersperses the whole book.&quot; In the latest &quot;White Scroll&quot;, I can clearly feel the overall design of the entire novel, which echoes and interlocks from beginning to end. The structure of a complex novel has been formed, such a chain of short stories to Were the changes in the novel an intentional result on your part? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Qin Ming: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, in fact, the &quot;Forensic Qin Ming&quot; series of novels is in volumes. The first six books are &quot;The Corpse Whisperer&quot; and &quot;The Silent One&quot;. &quot;Testimony&quot;, &quot;The Eleventh Finger&quot;, &quot;Scavenger&quot;, &quot;Survivor&quot; and &quot;Peeper&quot; are all &quot;Volume of Vientiane&quot;, writing about all phenomena in the world, so they are closer to the writing style of a collection of short stories. Then starting from &quot;The Condemned One&quot;, &quot;The Condemned One&quot;, &quot;The Forgotten One&quot;, &quot;Doll&quot; and &quot;The White Scroll&quot; are the &quot;Volume of All Living Beings&quot;. I will have a very different writing method, that is, although each book still has several Case story, but overall written around a social issue. For example, &quot;The Condemned&quot; mainly focuses on social responsibility, &quot;The Forgotten&quot; mainly focuses on the decadent ideas of female virtue, &quot;Doll&quot; focuses on domestic violence, and this &quot;White Scroll&quot; mainly focuses on communication in the parent-child relationship. question. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another change in my writing of novels is that I reduced the length of murder cases in &quot;The Volume of All Living Beings&quot; and added stories of other accidental deaths. There are three main reasons: First, Lao Qin himself He is the author of the realism school, but in reality, murder cases are indeed becoming fewer and fewer; secondly, forensic work definitely not only plays a role in homicide cases, but also plays an irreplaceable role in the judgment of the manner of death and the entire litigation process. I hope my readers can see stories of forensic scientists playing a role in other fields; third, forensic work is extensive and profound. In addition to on-site analysis, there are many other cases that require forensic scientists to contribute. I hope my readers can see the story of forensic scientists playing a role in other fields. Gain a comprehensive understanding of the forensic science profession. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You wrote a lot in &quot;White Volume&quot; about parents and children Does your book’s focus on parent-child issues have anything to do with your daily interactions and intergenerational gaps, and your identity as a father? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Qin Ming: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This question is not easy to answer, because like my father, I was absent from the growth process of my children. Due to work reasons, I used to travel for more than two hundred days a year. Now that I have fewer cases, I still have to travel for dozens to a hundred days. So I am quite busy at work, and I think I am still semi-absent in the education process of my children. But I am still very concerned about this issue, and hope to arouse everyone&#39;s concern for teenagers through novels.

This is not only a special demand for environmental resource cases (hereinafter referred to as &quot;environmental resource cases&quot;) that have surged in number in recent years and are extremely professional, but also a new expansion of the people&#39;s assessor system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the regulations were promulgated, Baicheng City in Jilin Province, Yangjiang City in Guangdong Province, Weichang County in Hebei Province, Lijin County in Shandong Province, Hunnan District in Shenyang City in Liaoning Province, Heilongjiang Forestry District and other places successively held court hearings on the province’s first cases involving persons with disabilities. People&#39;s assessors with specialized knowledge participate in environmental investment cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The jury system has only played a role in China&#39;s judicial field for a short time. In August 2004, the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress reviewed and passed the &quot;Decision on Improving the People&#39;s Assessor System&quot;, which clarified the people&#39;s assessor system for the first time, and China had &quot;unrobed judges.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the phenomenon of people&#39;s jurors &quot;accompanying the case but not trying the case, trying the case without deliberation&quot; and &quot;having no purpose&quot; is common, and has been criticized by the society and the legal circles. In April 2018, the Jury Law was officially promulgated, establishing principles such as random selection of jurors, term limits, and the &quot;grand collegial panel system&quot;, which has changed the shortcomings of the past to a certain extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Prior to this, China’s judicial system has set up an expert assistant system. The Criminal Procedure Law, Civil Procedure Law and other specialized laws revised after 2012 also increasingly advocate “expert assistants with specialized knowledge”. People appear in court.&quot; However, whether they are &quot;experts&quot; or &quot;people with specialized knowledge&quot;, they are all intended to solve professional and technical problems in the trial, and they all fall into the category of witnesses and evidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, in some cases in special fields, more and more &quot;expert&quot; people&#39;s jurors have appeared in collegial panels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Yongsheng, a professor of law at Peking University, said that the collegial panel consults professionals during the trial of cases, which has always existed in judicial practice. This institutionalization will help improve the professional trial level of environmental and capital-related cases. &quot;It is foreseeable that people with specialized knowledge will serve as jurors in other highly professional fields in the future.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The &quot;thrush&quot; whose identity is questionable&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;What kind of birds are the &quot;thrush&quot; and &quot;spotted water sparrow&quot;?

When the trial opened in May 2023, the court invited Li Zhihua, a staff member of the County Forestry Bureau, and Cao Lixiang, a staff member of the Qianyu Town Animal Health Supervision Office, to participate in the trial. Their identities were &quot;professional people&#39;s jurors.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the first environmental investment case in Sichuan to be heard by &quot;professional people&#39;s assessors&quot;, and it occurred before the regulations of the Supreme People&#39;s Court were promulgated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Hanyuan County Procuratorate accused Li Moumou of Malie Village of illegally manufacturing and possessing guns since 2018, and using slingshots and nail guns to hunt and kill multiple &quot;Thrushes&quot; and &quot;thrushes&quot; since 2020. A &quot;flower nose pattern&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because the case is not serious, this case adopts a simplified procedure, and the collegial panel adopts a &quot;1 (judge) + 2 (people&#39;s assessor)&quot; structure. The presiding judge, He Gang, is in his thirties and has served as a judge for 8 years. Although he has rich trial experience, he has insufficient biological knowledge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fur involved in the case was identified by Sichuan Agricultural University and was indeed a ferret and badger, a wild animal protected by the country’s “Three Certainties”. However, the thrush is a national second-level protected animal. What kind of bird the criminal mentioned as the &quot;thrush&quot; and how many there are are related to conviction and sentencing. Cao Lixiang and Li Zhihua, a staff member of the Hanyuan County Forestry Bureau, are here to help solve this problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cao Lixiang is a veterinarian with 30 years of experience.

So far, he has participated in 20 or 30 court trials, but most of them were grassroots civil disputes. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This case in May 2023 was the first time that Cao Lixiang and Li Zhihua used their professional backgrounds to serve as jurors as &quot;people&#39;s jurors with specialized knowledge.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cao Lixiang and Li Zhihua read the case files provided by the court in advance. During the trial, Cao Lixiang asked a number of questions: What gun did you use to shoot? Where did you get the call? How many shots were fired? Was it one hit, or several hits? Where did the ferret badger hit? After questioning, it was compared with the captured ferret and badger pelts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years of practice, Cao Lixiang has learned to check witness and physical evidence, &quot;to see if it is consistent with his confession. To prevent scapegoating.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cao Lixiang further asked about the characteristics of the &quot;Thrush&quot; that Li Moumou hunted: What was the fur like? What color is it? Where does feather color change? What are the characteristics of the head, tail, and trunk? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the issue of &quot;Thrush&quot;, Li Moumou&#39;s expression included different dialect names such as &quot;Thrush&quot; and &quot;Thrush&quot;. Cao Lixiang and Li Zhihua said that in rural areas of Hanyuan County, the &quot;thrush (sound mi) bird&quot; does not necessarily correspond to a real thrush, but may also be a water sparrow or other birds. There are many types of thrushes in biology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cao Lixiang hopes to determine whether the bird Li killed is a thrush, a second-level national protected animal, through biological characteristics, living habits, flight height and movements. However, since the characteristics confessed by Li Moumou are inconsistent with the biological characteristics of the thrush, and there was no physical evidence at the time of the crime, reasonable doubt cannot be ruled out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, due to insufficient evidence, the court did not recognize the fact that Li Moumou &quot;hunted&quot; the thrush. Li Moumou was convicted of illegal hunting for hunting ferret badgers and was sentenced to four months in prison. In addition to the two charges of illegally manufacturing guns and illegally possessing guns, he was punished for several crimes and was sentenced to three years and six months in prison. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/ys29RW2wJIALlNMgvfDZyasJxXkL6kOvmOn7Augq.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;672&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/ys29RW2wJIALlNMgvfDZyasJxXkL6kOvmOn7Augq.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251256&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;After the people&#39;s jurors with professional knowledge expressed their opinions, the Hanyuan County Court in Sichuan did not recognize the fact that a defendant &quot;hunted&quot; the thrush. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(People&#39;s Vision/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The &quot;thing&quot; that cannot speak&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; He Gang said that environmental investment cases are different from ordinary cases. &quot;Most of the time, things that affect the environment are a kind of &#39;object&#39;. Objects cannot speak, and they involve professional problems. For example, if a plant in a place dies, it may be There are many reasons for the accumulation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the judge looks up the information by himself, it will be limited to the knowledge structure, which will either consume time, or be inaccurate and unauthoritative. At this time, it is crucial for someone with specialized knowledge to provide professional advice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another characteristic of environmental investment cases is that no one pays attention to them in the early stage. By the time they are discovered, the cycle of contamination or damage has been very long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Youhai, executive director of the China Green Development Research Institute of Tianjin University, was the director of the Bill Office of the Environment and Resources Protection Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress. He published a paper in 2022 &quot;The Expert Juror System in the Context of Environmental Justice Specialization&quot; Study&quot; mentioned that environmental resource cases have complex causal relationships, resulting in long trial times. Due to the lack of professional knowledge, parties may easily doubt the fairness of court trials, affecting judicial credibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, Sun Youhai took the 2007 exhaust gas case from a mining and chemical company in Fujian. From 2010 to 2012, it went through prosecution, first-instance judgment, appeal, remand for retrial, second-instance judgment, application for retrial, and remand for retrial. The tortuous process of the retrial and the retrial judgment caused dissatisfaction among the parties involved. “One of the core reasons for the long and repetitive trial process is that the appraisal opinions of different appraisal agencies are inconsistent. However, environmental judges do not have professional environmental knowledge, so they cannot make accurate judgments on the appraisal opinions in a timely manner, which leads to the judicial organs’ inconsistencies in case trials and judgments. It is difficult to characterize the case.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the actual trial of environmental and capital-related cases, it is necessary to improve the professionalism of jurors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as April 2019, the Supreme People’s Court issued a judicial interpretation of the Jury Law, which stipulated that “if the type of case requires people’s jurors with corresponding professional knowledge to participate in collegial panel trials, they may be The circumstances of the case shall be determined by random selection from the list of people&#39;s jurors who meet professional needs.&quot; Since then, &quot;expert jurors&quot; have been selected for cases in the fields of intellectual property, minors, finance, medical disputes, and network technology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In comparison, environmental investment cases involve chemical, biological, forestry, animal husbandry, minerals, land, water resources and other subcategories. They are more professional and difficult for laymen to judge. The needs are also more urgent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;The regulations issued by the Supreme Law on environmental capital cases clarify that &quot;people&#39;s jurors with specialized knowledge&quot; refer to those who have specialized knowledge in the field of environmental resources, or who have experience in environmental resources administrative departments, scientific research institutes, higher education institutions, etc. Jurors who have worked in institutions, enterprises, social organizations and other units for more than three years. This regulation will be implemented from August 1, 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, before the regulations were promulgated, courts at all levels across the country had already conducted many relevant explorations and practices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The People&#39;s Court of Qingzhen City, Guizhou Province established China&#39;s first ecological protection court in 2007. In December 2010, the court invited two people to hear a case of illegal discharge of sewage from a paper mill. The &quot;people&#39;s assessors&quot; include Shuai Jiang, a senior environmental engineer and director of Guiyang&#39;s Two Lakes and One Reservoir Management Bureau, and Liu Xiaojing, a Ph.D. in environmental protection. An expert advisory committee was convened to conduct demonstrations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2014, the Wanzhou District Court of Chongqing approved the appointment of four environmental experts including Yao Weizhi, deputy director of the Fisheries Resources Research Institute of Southwest University, and Ren Ping, director of the Wanzhou District Forestry Science Institute, to serve as jurors He has participated in the trial of a series of cases including the Fengjie County electromagnetic radiation case, the yew pollution case, and the Kaixian cattle farm land pollution case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some places are also actively building expert databases for environmental jurors. For example, the Higher People&#39;s Court of Guizhou Province issued the &quot;Regulations on the Participation of Environmental Expert Jurors in Case Trials&quot; in early 2014 and established an expert database for ecological and environmental jurors. From January 2016 to December 2017, Chongqing courts at all levels hired a total of 18 experts as expert jurors to participate in the collegial panel hearing of 124 cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By 2022, it will gradually become a trend to invite experts with environmental protection expertise to serve as jurors. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Randomness and fairness&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2018, the first special legal jury law on the people&#39;s assessor system was promulgated, which was widely praised by the legal community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Yongsheng, a law professor at Peking University, believes that a very important point of the jury law is to strengthen the randomness of jurors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, people&#39;s jurors in courts at all levels were mainly recommended by their units and grassroots organizations, or jurors recommended themselves. After the promulgation of the Juror Law, although the recommendation model has been retained, the main method of selection is that the judicial administrative agency, together with the courts and the public security agency, randomly selects from the list of local residents, conducts a qualification review, and then submits it to the Standing Committee of the People&#39;s Congress at the same level for approval and approval. appointment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Yongsheng also believes that before the law was enacted, the jury seats in many places were fixed and full-time for a long time. They were familiar with the judges and had difficulty in functioning. The random generation of jurors helps prevent judicial corruption. &quot;The laws of psychology show that the possibility of corruption is higher when a person is dealing with acquaintances. On the contrary, in front of a stranger, if the other party violates the law, the other party will You may still have concerns about reporting and seeking improper benefits.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1980s and 1990s, China&#39;s legal system had a &quot;negative attitude&quot; towards the jury system. Academic circles call it the &quot;low ebb&quot; of the jury system. At that time, He Jiahong, who later became a law professor at Renmin University of China, was still studying in the United States and had begun to understand the American jury system. The Simpson case that occurred in the 1990s gave great inspiration to the Chinese legal community. &quot;It turns out that cases in the United States can still be tried in this way and let some ordinary people decide.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Jury Law, the court selects 5 times the number of proposed jurors as candidates, and the number of jurors actually selected is not less than 3 times the number of judges of the court. In some pilot courts, the number of jurors is even 10 times that of judges. This is precisely to enhance the broadness and representativeness of the people&#39;s assessors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, the Juror Law stipulated that jurors must be at least 28 years old, which is higher than the 23 years old requirement in 2004. Chen Yongsheng once proposed that based on the principle of &quot;same trial&quot;, the age limit should be expanded. &quot;This is to expand and enhance the representativeness of judges. Because of the existing regulations, defendants under the age of 28 do not have the identity composition corresponding to Homogeneous jurors”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind this proposal, the inherent spirit of the jury system is reflected - jurors should not only be selected from legal professionals, such as university professors and judicial assistants, but also should introduce folk wisdom. In other words, let &quot;lay people&quot; participate in the trial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Why should a jury system be established? Because the way people who have studied law has formatted their minds to think about problems, they are more rational than ordinary people. And private juries Based on perceptual life experience, a judge can fully understand the cause-and-effect connections and feelings and reactions of the defendant when he behaves better than a judge.&quot; Chen Yongsheng said that this will help the case judgment to be more in line with the legal provisions, and also help the court to maximize its effectiveness within the legal framework. Taking into account the humanity and personal feelings of the parties involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, the judicial interpretation of the Supreme People&#39;s Court has changed the standard for determining &quot;justifiable defense&quot; due to the public opinion caused by many major cases, and it has become closer to human ethics. &quot;If the jury system is used properly, it can achieve the organic unity of national law and human relations, national law and natural justice.&quot; Chen Yongsheng said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Anglo-American jury system is composed of one team for each case, and a new team is formed for each case. Jurors in the civil law system also have a term limit of no more than two terms. &quot;Whether it is the common law system or the civil law system, you cannot always serve as a juror to prevent jurors from changing from laymen to experts. Otherwise, the advantages that jurors may have as laymen cannot be used.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics from the Supreme People&#39;s Court, as of 2021, there are more than 316,000 people&#39;s jurors across the country, an increase of about 50% from 2018. He Jiahong believes that in recent years, the number of cases nationwide has increased rapidly. Since 2019, the total number of cases accepted by people&#39;s courts at all levels across the country has been more than 30 million every year. &quot;The number of cases involving specialized knowledge in various fields is also increasing. Therefore, the courts are facing the problem of insufficient manpower and brainpower.&quot; He Jiahong believes that the introduction of regulations this time to invite people with specialized knowledge to serve as people&#39;s assessors can effectively solve the problem of court manpower and brainpower. Lack of brain power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/MAnwC42xdiZsLdSFdeEYFFPyxO9AjO6hm41DCkSr.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;865&quot; height= &quot;577&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/MAnwC42xdiZsLdSFdeEYFFPyxO9AjO6hm41DCkSr.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251254&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;People&#39;s assessors Cao Lixiang (middle) and Li Zhihua (right) are looking at relevant evidence. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Hanyuan County People&#39;s Court/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;From &quot;expert&quot; to &quot;professional knowledge&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt; /h4>; &lt;p>;“This new regulation only institutionalizes a method that was widely used in previous practice in a certain type of case.” Chen Yongsheng said that British Justice Dan Dan was widely recognized by the Chinese legal circle. Lord Ning also mentioned in his book &quot;Due Process of the Law&quot; that an important function of the jury is to hire professional jurors to resolve professional issues. &quot;It is foreseeable that the use of people with specialized knowledge to serve as jurors will also be implemented in other more professional fields in the future, or corresponding regulations will be introduced.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Yongsheng once served as a consulting expert and was invited by the Public Security Bureau to discuss some environmental protection cases, but he admitted that he could only express opinions on the legal issues involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, Chen Yongsheng encountered a criminal case involving pollution caused by the accumulation of construction waste. The procuratorate hoped to determine whether the suspect committed a crime by understanding the degree of harm and whether to prosecute. &quot;I don&#39;t know whether a kind of garbage is harmful to the environment. I think construction waste is nothing more than steel bars and cement and should be harmless. But professionals say that the accumulation of construction waste will damage the soil and cultivated land, and it will also be damaged after being wet by rain. Some toxic substances will be released. This requires specialized researchers to understand.&quot; In the end, the opinions of environmental experts played an important reference role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, before the regulations were promulgated, Tianjin University Law School was entrusted to hold an expert seminar on &quot;Several Provisions of the Supreme People&#39;s Court on the Participation of Expert People&#39;s Assessors in the Trial of Environmental Resources Cases&quot; (Draft for Comments). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the final regulations, &quot;expert people&#39;s assessors&quot; were changed to &quot;people&#39;s assessors with specialized knowledge.&quot; The change in title was based on practical considerations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Chen Yongsheng&#39;s view, the so-called experts should at least have a master&#39;s degree or even a doctorate, work in a university or scientific research institution, and have an intermediate or even deputy senior professional title. &quot;The ideal situation is of course for experts to serve as jurors. But there are more than 3,000 courts across the country, and more than 90% of them are grassroots courts. If the status is limited to experts, the threshold is too high, and grassroots courts obviously cannot do it.&quot; In fact, the grassroots courts cannot do it. , the professional issues in most cases only need to be identified by people with relevant professional background and experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, &quot;person with specialized knowledge&quot; is also a relatively common term in law. There are many provisions in the current Criminal Procedure Law and Civil Procedure Law to &quot;hire persons with specialized knowledge&quot; to appear in court or Make an appraisal. Chen Yongsheng explained, &quot;This &#39;person with specialized knowledge&#39; is called an expert assistant in the legal world, and is sometimes called an expert witness.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But obviously, these all belong to the category of witnesses, and are not the same as those introduced in the collegial panel. Knowledgeable jurors are two different judicial paths and directions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Xiangbin, a lawyer at Hubei Huanyuan Law Firm, has conducted dozens of public interest litigations on environmental investment cases. &quot;I have not found a case where professional issues have affected the fair trial of the court.&quot; &quot;The existing litigation system is sufficient, and there is no need to find an additional professional person.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Yongsheng does not agree with this. Chen Yongsheng believes that the expert witness and judicial appraisal system serve both parties in the dispute. The appraisal reports issued by each party are generally beneficial to them, and the expert witnesses invited are often also beneficial to them. In the same case, the appraisal results of the plaintiff and the defendant are sometimes opposite, and even the procuratorate’s appraisal results are inconsistent several times. “At this time, jurors with professional knowledge stand in a neutral position to judge the prosecution and defense.” It is necessary to distinguish the true from the false and eliminate the false while retaining the true.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Youhai also pointed out in the paper that expert assistants are only responsible for the parties, and their neutrality and independence are lacking. This is different for jurors with professional knowledge. On the one hand, they can scientifically determine the evidence and facts of the case; On the other hand, it can also effectively supervise the trial work of the court on behalf of the people. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Equality of power with judges must be ensured&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The regulations announced by the Supreme People’s Court this time will apply to basic people’s courts and intermediate people’s courts. When hearing environmental resources cases, clear requirements are put forward for the number of &quot;people&#39;s jurors with specialized knowledge&quot;, and requirements are also put forward for the number of collegial panels depending on the circumstances of the case, which is basically consistent with the principles of the Jury Law. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both He Jiahong and Chen Yongsheng believe that although the legislation is relatively complete, the biggest problem in judicial practice is that the jury system has not been fully implemented. In recent years, some cases with significant social impact have not all adopted the jury system. Chen Yongsheng believes that &quot;Although the case handling agency also made excuses, for example, it was worried that the jurors would not be able to manipulate and make decisions, their excuses were not convincing. It violated the legislative purpose of the Juror Law.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He Jiahong also expressed regret, &quot;Including judicial reforms in countries with civil law systems such as France, major and serious criminal cases have adopted the jury system. However, in our country for many years, some major cases have not required juries, but daily ordinary cases have used juries. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He and some legal experts were invited by the court to observe some court trials. One expert said, &quot;This case is not very important, and the defendant also pleaded guilty and there is no dispute. Why do we need jurors? ?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Jiahong believes that these cases with great social impact were originally excellent opportunities to promote the concept of the jury system to the society, but they were wasted. &quot;With extremely high attention, higher requirements have also been put forward on how court leaders and judges manage the collegiate bench.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason is that Chen Yongsheng said that many cases need to be reported to special committees, adjudicatory committees, judges, deans, and even to higher-level courts, political and legal committees and other higher-level units before decisions can be made. result. “The decision-making power in many cases does not lie with the collegial panel.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Yongsheng said, &quot;The collegial panel has no decision-making power, let alone jurors. Even if the jurors express their opinions, they cannot affect the outcome of the case, which leads to the jurors being unwilling to actively exercise their right to serve as a jury.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;Specifically when it comes to the trial of environmental resources cases, Sun Youhai pointed out that a guarantee system should be provided for people&#39;s jurors with specialized knowledge, including the right to participate in the trial, the right to know the case and the right to vote on the case, to ensure that the jurors&#39; rights and The equal power of judges allows them to &quot;devote themselves whole-heartedly to the jury work of the case and have no worries when performing their jury duties.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[在野党党首绝食抗议，日本核污水排海再引韩国朝野纷争]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257212]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-20 17:39:44&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/20/uMBu5GmaGxoYRYoG1X1WJetEUJcrCreencsaMH7u.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/uMBu5GmaGxoYRYoG1X1WJetEUJcrCreencsaMH7u. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251307&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Congressman Lee, you are no longer alone.&quot; On the afternoon of September 19, 2023, former South Korean President Moon Jae-in appeared at a hospital in Seoul to visit Lee Jae-myung, leader of the opposition Democratic Party of Korea . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moon Jae-in held Lee Jae-myung&#39;s hands tightly and persuaded him to &quot;stop the hunger strike&quot; and engage in the &quot;long-term battle&quot; (of the Common Democratic Party) with a new attitude. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Early the morning before, an ambulance took Li Zaiming to the hospital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Lee was in extremely poor health tomorrow morning and was in a daze and had to make an emergency call.&quot; Park Sang-joon, spokesman for the Democratic Party of Korea, told South Korea&#39;s YTN radio station. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;September 18, 2023 was the 19th day of Li Zaiming&#39;s &quot;hunger strike&quot; to demonstrate against the Yin Xiyue government. On that day, the South Korean court once again filed an application for detention of Li Zaiming on the charge of &quot;dereliction of duty.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lee Jae-myung accused the Yoon Seok-yue regime of undermining order and democracy in South Korea, and went on a hunger strike on August 31. As of now, Li Zaiming is out of danger, but his body is still weak. He stated that he would only maintain infusion treatment and continue his hunger strike. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Lee Jae-myung&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;’s “indefinite hunger strike”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“As one of the citizens, I start today to challenge the incompetent and violent regime. &#39;National&#39; resistance.&quot; On August 31, 2023, Lee Jae-myung announced an &quot;indefinite hunger strike&quot; at the press conference for the first anniversary of the Democratic Party of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zaiming made three demands to the ruling party: Yin Xiyue apologized to the people for destroying people&#39;s livelihood; the ruling party should oppose Japan&#39;s discharge of nuclear-contaminated water into the sea; and reorganize the cabinet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lee Jae-myung is Moon Jae-in’s “successor” within the party. Before entering politics, Li Zaiming was a human rights lawyer and participated in human rights and citizen movements many times. From 2010 to 2021, Lee Jae-myung served successively as the mayor of Seongnam and the governor of Gyeonggi Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2021, Lee Jae-myung resigned as governor of Gyeonggi Province and participated in the South Korean presidential election. He narrowly lost to South Korean President Yoon Seok-yue and later became the leader of the Democratic Party of Korea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early days of the hunger strike, Li Zaiming set up a tent in front of the Capitol and conducted a sit-in protest. As Lee Jae-myung&#39;s health declined, he began to move into the party leader&#39;s office. Many senior figures from the Democratic Party of Korea and South Korean politicians came to persuade him to stop his hunger strike. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Korean media reports, the ruling National Power Party &quot;took no measures&quot; in response to Lee Jae-myung&#39;s hunger strike. &lt;p>; /p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Central Daily News&quot; editorial criticized the ruling party&#39;s inappropriate stance on &quot;Lee Jae-myung&#39;s hunger strike.&quot; The National Power Party once ridiculed that &quot;a seafood tasting event will be held near Lee Jae-myung&#39;s hunger strike tent.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sit-ins, marches and hunger strikes are common practice in South Korea’s political arena, and both the ruling and opposition parties will express condolences to hunger strikers. In the 1980s, when former South Korean President Kim Young-sam went on a hunger strike, the secretary of the then ruling party went to express condolences and conveyed then President Chun Doo-hwan’s intention to urge an end to the hunger strike; in 1990, when former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung went on a hunger strike to demand the full implementation of local autonomy , Jin Yongsan also went to express condolences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Facing pressure from public opinion, Kim Ki-hyun posted on social media on September 16, &quot;solemnly requesting Lee Jae-myung to stop his hunger strike&quot; and proposing to hold a meeting between the leaders of the ruling and opposition parties to discuss people&#39;s livelihood affairs after he &quot;recovers his health.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“To avoid prosecution charges”? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;South Korean prosecutors once believed that Lee Jae-myung&#39;s hunger strike was suspected of avoiding the prosecutor&#39;s investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This is the first time I have gone on a hunger strike after being notified of being summoned by the prosecutor.” Korean Minister of Justice Han Dong-hoon complained that the continued operation of the judicial system cannot be suspended just because a suspect under investigation went on a hunger strike. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 4, South Korean prosecutors investigated Lee Jae-ming in connection with the &quot;Sangling Group Bribery Case.&quot; It is believed that when he was the governor of Gyeonggi Province from 2019 to 2020, he was suspected of soliciting a bribe of approximately 10.6 billion won from Kim Sung-tae, chairman of Sangryong Group, on the pretext of paying for a visit to North Korea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Li Zaiming is related to two cases. From 2014 to 2015, while serving as the mayor of Seongnam City, Lee Jae-myung was suspected of taking care of real estate developers based on his position, causing the Seongnam Urban Development Corporation to lose 20 billion won. In February 2019, Lee Jae-myung was suspected of violating the Public Office Election Act and instigating others to provide false testimony that was favorable to him during his trial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of September 18, when Li Zaiming was seeking medical treatment, South Korean prosecutors merged the two suspicions of the &quot;Sangling Group Bribery Case&quot; and the &quot;Real Estate Case&quot; and applied for an arrest warrant against Li Zaiming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 19, Yin Xiyue, who was attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York, approved the arrest consent request sent by the prosecutor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a current member of Congress, Lee Jae-myung enjoys the privilege of not being arrested without the consent of Congress. To arrest a member of Congress, more than half of the members must be present and more than half of the members must agree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to South Korea&#39;s &quot;Parliament Law&quot;, after receiving the consent for arrest, the Speaker of the National Assembly needs to convene a plenary meeting report on the matter and vote &quot;within 24 hours and 72 hours&quot; after the report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;South Korean prosecutors are using clues to bite Li Zaiming, but the possibility of him being arrested this time is not high.&quot; Li Jiacheng, associate professor at the School of International Economics and Politics at Liaoning University, analyzed to Southern Weekend reporters, South Korea in February 2023 The prosecutor&#39;s request to arrest Lee Jae-myung for the real estate case was rejected by Congress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, South Korea has 297 current members of Congress, including 167 members from the Common Democratic Party, accounting for more than half of the opposition parties. This time, Li Zaiming&#39;s hunger strike received concern and condolences from important people within the party. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Central Daily News&quot; report, on September 20, the South Korean Congress will hold a plenary meeting to discuss the &quot;Lee Jae-myung Arrest Consent Case&quot; and vote on September 21. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 21, the South Korean Congress will also vote on the &quot;Recommendation for the Removal of Prime Minister Han Deok-soo.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to Lee Jae-myung’s hunger strike, the Democratic Party of Korea submitted a proposal to dismiss Prime Minister Han Deok-soo on September 16, demanding the collective resignation of the ruling party’s cabinet. The move was seen as an attempt by the opposition parties to put pressure on the Yoon Seok-yue government. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The controversy behind the discharge of nuclear-contaminated water into the sea&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the recent &quot;issue of Japan&#39;s discharge of nuclear-contaminated water into the sea&quot;, the Korean government and the opposition are quite divided. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of August 23, before the hunger strike, Lee Jae-myung led more than a thousand people related to the Democratic Party of Korea to hold a candlelight rally. He accused &quot;the East China Sea is turning into the Sea of ​​Japan&quot; and urged the Yoon Seok-yue government to oppose the discharge of Japan&#39;s nuclear-contaminated water into the sea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The National Power Party represented by Yin Xiyue supports &quot;discharging nuclear contaminated water into the sea&quot; and sends a signal to the international community that &quot;you will not die if you eat aquatic products.&quot; On August 29, the ruling party held a two-day and one-night &quot;eating broadcast&quot; to promote aquatic products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Representative Lee (Jae-myeong) comes to a place like this and eats some (aquatic products)!&quot; Park Dae-chu, chairman of the policy committee of the National Power Party, joked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Ordinary people in South Korea strongly oppose Japan&#39;s discharge of nuclear-contaminated water into the sea, and the progressive Democratic Party supports the ordinary people. The National Power Party, which is dominated by conservative forces, is pro-American and pro-Japanese in foreign policy. Yoon Seok-yue The government strongly supports Japan&#39;s discharge of nuclear-contaminated water. The opposition between South Korea&#39;s ruling party and public opinion has become a political opportunity for Lee Jae-myung,&quot; Li Jiacheng told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Jiacheng believes that Li Zaiming’s hunger strike is more like preparation for canvassing votes for the 2024 South Korean parliamentary election. On the one hand, he united the &quot;unknown&quot; forces within the Democratic Party of Korea, and on the other hand, he fought for the &quot;people&quot; and won the sympathy votes of voters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 10, 2024, the South Korean Congress will hold an election. Since Lee Jae-myung&#39;s Democratic Party holds a majority of seats in the National Assembly, the ruling National Power Party hopes to regain control of the National Assembly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since Yin Xiyue narrowly defeated Democratic candidate Li Zaiming by a narrow margin of 0.73% in 2022, he has never admitted that Li Zaiming is his &quot;dialogue partner.&quot; The two have not held formal talks since the election. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Yin Xiyue disdains talks with the suspect (Lee Jae-myung).&quot; &quot;The Hankyoreh&quot; quoted a core figure of the ruling party as saying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 19, after Lee Jae-myung received medical treatment, according to a South Korean Media Tomato poll, less than 30% of the people gave a positive evaluation of &lt;span>;Yin Xiyue&#39;s administration&lt;/span>;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nearly half of the people believe that Li Zaiming&#39;s hunger strike is a protest against &quot;Yin Xiyue&#39;s mismanagement&quot;, and nearly 42% of people oppose &quot;the arrest of Li Zaiming&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend intern Lin Xi also contributed to this article)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 17:55:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
