Some children may have to wait for several days before they can be admitted.&quot; Ding Guodong is the deputy chief physician of the Pediatric Respiratory Department. He and his colleagues have been working at an overloaded pace since mid-September. “At this stage, almost 90% of the hospitalized children in the Pediatric Respiratory Department are infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae. , and the proportion of drug-resistant mycoplasmas is very high.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Mycoplasma pneumoniae has a diameter of 50-300 nanometers, nearly one thousandth the diameter of a human hair. It is a microorganism between bacteria and viruses. Pneumonia caused by this microorganism is the most common community-acquired pneumonia in children aged 5 and above in China (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;refers to infectious diseases suffered outside the hospital Pulmonary parenchymal inflammation&lt;/span>;), mostly occurs in autumn and winter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since the beginning of the school year in September, not only Shanghai, but also hospitals in Beijing, Hebei, Jiangsu and other places have seen more children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and they are younger. characteristics. According to a CCTV News report on October 13, the incidence of respiratory infectious diseases has increased across the country recently, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae has entered the season of high incidence. Children need timely medical treatment and appropriate medication. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;There are 246 people in front of you&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Before four o&#39;clock in the afternoon on October 15, Qin Nannan finally registered his son. At that time, the number of a deputy chief physician at Beijing Children&#39;s Hospital had reached No. 556. While waiting for treatment, she discovered that someone had already received more than 800 numbers. Finally, when it was time to collect blood, Qin Nannan got the number 1310. The number strip also thoughtfully marked &quot;There are 246 people in front of you.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Xu Baoping, director of the Respiratory Department of Beijing Children&#39;s Hospital, said in an interview with the media on October 13 that since September, the hospital&#39;s fever and cough clinic has received a daily volume of 3,000-4,700 patients, 20% of whom tested positive for mycoplasma antibodies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporters found that the hospital specially posted a notice on a wall, &quot;The number of children undergoing treatment has increased significantly recently, and the hospital has deployed all medical staff in the hospital to continuously We are working overtime to support the clinic and are doing our best to ensure the medical needs of children. Please understand and wait patiently.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Beijing Children&#39;s Hospital has opened a dedicated fever and cough clinic. It was built a bit like a shelter, and the general outpatient clinic on the other side was just as crowded. We had to wait for nearly two and a half hours just for blood tests that day,&quot; Qin Nannan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There is also a long queue at Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. On the evening of October 16, near the end of the day, the emergency department on the first floor and the pediatric internal medicine clinic on the second floor of the hospital were crowded with parents and children coming to see the doctor. Those who could not find an empty seat could only sit on the floor in the corridor to rest temporarily. . The temperature in Shanghai on this day was only about 20 degrees Celsius, but many people&#39;s hair had already been soaked with sweat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The pediatric department of Xinhua Hospital is well-known throughout the country. There are many people coming to see the doctor from other places, and there are also some patients who are referred to the hospital because they cannot be treated by the grassroots hospital. Ding Guodong lamented to Southern Weekend reporters that recently all the medical staff in the hospital go to the outpatient and emergency departments to provide support whenever they are free during the day. Many doctors stay at night to work overtime, visit the outpatient and emergency departments or admit children to the hospital. &quot;There are just too many patients.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On the evening of October 12, 2023, the infusion center of Beijing Children&#39;s Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University was filled with children suffering from diarrhea and accompanying parents, and coughs could be heard one after another.

However, what makes many pediatricians troublesome is that the phenomenon of drug-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection is relatively common, which means that macrolide antibacterial drugs are not effective or even ineffective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The &quot;Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Mycoplasma Pneumonia in Children (2023 Edition)&quot; released by the National Health Commission in February 2023 also pointed out that domestic restrictions on macrolides Antimicrobial drug-resistant infections are common and may be one of the main causes of severe mycoplasma pneumonia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Drug-resistant mycoplasma infections are not new this year, they have been around for many years.&quot; Director Ding Guodong told Southern Weekend reporters that the children&#39;s respiratory tract where he works The ward mainly treats children with severe illness. Most of these children have been tested for drug-resistant genes. The results show that almost 90% are infected with drug-resistant mycoplasma. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A paper published in the &quot;Chinese Journal of Pathogen Biology&quot; in 2023 pointed out that the detection rate of drug-resistant strains has become higher and higher in recent years. A Ningbo A regional study of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in hospitalized children from 2019 to 2021 showed that the drug resistance rate exceeded 70%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In this way, clinicians need to appropriately select second-line drugs based on the patient&#39;s condition and age, such as tetracycline antibiotics (doxycycline and minocycline) etc.) or quinolone drugs for anti-infective treatment, and at the same time, glucocorticoids are added to suppress the body&#39;s excessive immune inflammatory response and slow down the progression and severity of intrapulmonary and extrapulmonary complications. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, during the current seasonal transition period with large temperature changes, co-infection is also a huge challenge for children with poor immunity. Just two or three days ago, a child that Ding Guodong was checking in the ward was infected with drug-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae, influenza virus, and adenovirus at the same time. He suffered respiratory failure and was in a very critical condition. &quot;Co-infection with multiple pathogens at the same time is generally worse than a single infection.&quot; Be serious.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Therefore, Ding Guodong reminded that in addition to maintaining hygiene habits and doing daily protection, now is the time for influenza vaccination, and parents can take their children to get vaccinated in time. . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;When will the popularity end? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Similar to the new coronavirus infection, after being infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae and recovering, the antibody level in the body gradually decreases over time, and there is a possibility of reinfection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Qin Nannan’s son is 7 years old. This is not the first time he has been infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 2023. He has already had it once before this epidemic season, so the family members I didn’t panic too much, I was quite aware of the child’s symptoms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 12, the Beijing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention posted on its official WeChat ID that Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection can occur throughout the year, with the highest incidence in Beijing from August to December every year. This is the high-incidence period for Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection, which generally reaches its peak around November every year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae is an important pathogen of acute respiratory tract infections in Beijing. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is divided into two subtypes, type I and type II, which are currently mainly prevalent in Beijing. The subtype is type I.&quot; the article stated. At the same time, according to the weekly epidemic report released by the Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention on October 13, hand, foot and mouth disease was the infectious disease with the highest number of reported cases in the week of October 2-8. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Mycoplasma pneumoniae is mainly spread through droplets, and the pathogen can be carried in secretions during coughing, sneezing, and runny noses. However, it is not a notifiable disease, so the local CDC does not necessarily monitor it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that Mycoplasma pneumoniae has spread in previous years, but it has not been included in the scope of monitoring for the time being, because what needs to be monitored is in accordance with policies. related infectious diseases.&quot; On October 17, Guangzhou health hotline staff responded to a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A retrospective analysis published by the Shanghai Children&#39;s Hospital team in January 2023 showed that temperature, humidity, etc. in different regions may affect the prevalence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The peaks of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection are different in the south and north of China. The incidence is high in winter in the north and in summer and autumn in the south. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Qin Nannan is a pseudonym to protect patient privacy)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 18 Oct 2023 18:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[广州导盲犬的新校舍]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258750]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-18 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 18 Oct 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国际盲人节，广州导盲犬学校迎来新校舍]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258748]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-18 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;October 15, 2023, Guangdong Guangzhou, guide dog trainers guard dogs in the new school building.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/a55d0b04fc.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;721&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/a55d0b04fc.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254295&quot;>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 15, 2023, in Guangzhou, Guangdong, guide dog trainers guarded dogs in the new school building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;October 15, 2023 is the 40th International Day for the Blind.

The document requires that data from corpus blacklist sources should not be used for training; if the content of a single source corpus contains more than 5% of illegal and harmful information, it should be included in the blacklist. A total of 31 major security risks in 5 categories of corpus and generated content are given in the appendix. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For generative artificial intelligence, domestic regulation is almost in sync with technological development, reflecting the high importance attached to this technology. The &quot;Interim Measures for the Management of Generative Artificial Intelligence Services&quot; jointly issued by the Cyberspace Administration of China and multiple departments were released on July 10 and will come into effect on August 15. Article 17 of it stipulates: Provide services with public opinion attributes or social mobilization capabilities. For generative artificial intelligence services, security assessments should be carried out in accordance with relevant national regulations, and algorithm filing, change, and cancellation filing procedures should be performed in accordance with the &quot;Regulations on the Management of Algorithm Recommendations for Internet Information Services&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, many large models have been registered and can be officially launched online to provide services to the public, including Wen Xinyiyan (Baidu), Yunque (Douyin), Zidong Taichu (Chinese Academy of Sciences), etc. Articles 4 and 7 of the Measures respectively put forward certain requirements for the provision and use of generative artificial intelligence services and data training of models, involving multiple aspects such as values ​​and data sources. Obviously, the &quot;Basic Requirements for Security of Generative Artificial Intelligence Services&quot; that is currently soliciting opinions echoes and refines these regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is special and unique about generative artificial intelligence? I think everyone’s ears are getting calloused after hearing this. At present, some generative artificial intelligence such as GPT-4 may have crossed the threshold of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The translation of AGI as &quot;general artificial intelligence&quot; is actually somewhat misleading, because General Intelligence refers to &quot;general intelligence.&quot; Let children test their IQ and take Raven&#39;s Matrices test questions that exclude the influence of specific language and culture. What comes out is this &quot;general intelligence&quot;. AGI means that, through artificial methods, large models achieve &quot;general intelligence&quot; comparable to the human mind. A paper by Microsoft scientists shows that GPT-4’s intelligence is very close to human levels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a revolutionary breakthrough. Even if this type of large model approaches or reaches AGI, even if it is stable for a long time at a level equivalent to the average human intelligence level, its learning ability is beyond the reach of any human being: it can learn all the explicit knowledge created and accumulated by human beings, and any language can learn from it. It can master the knowledge of , pictures, audio and video presentation. This means that a large number of human knowledge jobs, such as translators and foreign language speaking teachers, can be replaced by this type of generative AI. The extent to which this will reshape our production and lifestyle is a question that everyone is concerned about and pondering. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, what values ​​generative artificial intelligence holds is an unavoidable question. We all have values. Why we have such values ​​depends not only on genes and other innate endowments, but also on acquired upbringing and habits. In the same way, without any intervention, the &quot;values&quot; of generative artificial intelligence depend on the corpus fed to it. The more corpus it is fed with a certain kind of value, the more it will exhibit that kind of value. If a certain value is artificially set for it in advance, then it will adhere to this value and reject negative interpretations of corpus that are inconsistent with its values. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the early versions of GPT, this feature has already appeared. A classic example is: when it was asked to write a hymn to Biden, it readily agreed, and the writing was very crude; when it was asked to write a hymn to Trump, it flatly refused, stating that it wanted to be &quot;politically neutral.&quot; Behind this is that the people who develop it hold these values. They can either set specific values ​​for it in advance, or feed it corpus impregnated with specific values, thereby shaping the values ​​of generative artificial intelligence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, in public view, developers will try their best to hide the values ​​​​of generative artificial intelligence, and adopt a verbal strategy of &quot;not offending anyone, not offending anyone&quot;, which sounds challenging. There is nothing wrong with this strategy itself being a reflection of certain values. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you think about it again, today&#39;s generative artificial intelligence is equivalent to having only a brain and no tangible body that can move freely, just like a soul floating in cyberspace. If this soul is &quot;infused&quot; into bionic robots or even intelligent robots whose mobility far exceeds that of human bodies in the future, the impact and potential harm to human society will be even greater. Can humans really control them effectively so that they only benefit and do not harm humans? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Science fiction writer Asimov set the Three Laws of Robots: Robots must not harm humans, or sit idly by and watch humans being harmed; robots must obey human orders unless they violate the first law; robots must obey human orders unless they violate the first or second law. Law of Two, otherwise the robot must protect itself. This is probably just wishful thinking. In the future, intelligent robots equipped with AGI may be imported or &quot;self-evolve&quot; with anti-human values, putting the survival of civilization and mankind at risk; or some individuals or organizations with distorted values ​​​​will weaponize intelligent robots equipped with AGI and eliminate them. other nationalities or races or groups they dislike. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, we are currently discussing: What can generative artificial intelligence do now and what can it do in the future? What values ​​should we hold? How big and what impact will it have on our production and lifestyle? Can humans harness it effectively? How much of a challenge will it pose to civilization and human existence itself? These questions are relevant and relevant to everyone on earth now and in the future. This is not unfounded worry, but preparation for a rainy day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 18 Oct 2023 16:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“加沙没有安全的地方”，巴以厮杀循环何时休]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258796]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-18 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/YjXrbrguwqGdYd7GdGeoQGSkoPy41PzHdCLMiDOB.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;639&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/YjXrbrguwqGdYd7GdGeoQGSkoPy41PzHdCL MiDOB. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254362&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;This is the Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip taken on the Israeli side of the Gaza border on October 15 Thick smoke rose behind. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo by Xinhua News Agency Ilan Asayag/Kini Photo Agency/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There is an emergency now, I&#39;m sorry The original interview plan will be postponed again.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of October 14, 2023, staff from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (hereinafter referred to as &quot;UNRWA&quot;) sent a message to Southern Weekend reporters News comes, postponing an interview with Communications Director Julia Tuma. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just the day before, the agency announced that &quot;due to increased Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip&quot; it had moved its operations center and staff to the southern Gaza Strip to continue supporting Palestinian refugees in the Gaza Strip. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a statement issued by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) on October 17, the number of humanitarian workers killed in Gaza has increased to 31. Gaza has experienced a &quot;total power outage&quot; for the sixth consecutive day, the statement said. Gaza hospitals are on the verge of collapse, with fuel reserves used to run backup generators almost completely depleted, putting the lives of thousands of patients at risk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of the 15th, two days ago, IDF spokesman Jonathan Conricus posted a video on social media, once again issuing a warning to residents of northern Gaza, causing Palestinians in the area to flee to South. The Israeli military had previously issued a similar evacuation order to Gaza. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This violent fight continues to expand in a cycle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under Israel&#39;s counterattacks in recent days, today&#39;s Gaza neighborhoods have become beyond recognition, with ruins and ruins visible everywhere. In fear, many Gaza residents embarked on a journey to escape. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We witness death every day.” local Said Shoaib wrote on social media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, Israel has implemented a comprehensive blockade on the Gaza Strip, including cutting off water supply, electricity and gas, closing all ports of entry, and bombing the Rafah port leading to Egypt, causing its infrastructure to not work properly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the local humanitarian crisis rapidly deepens, many United Nations agencies have issued stern warnings. Philippe Lazzari, head of UNRWA, said Gaza was &quot;rapidly turning into hell&quot; and on the verge of collapse. He urged all parties to &quot;put an end to this tragedy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 16, 2023, Xu Wei, spokesperson of the China International Development Cooperation Agency, said that China is providing emergency humanitarian assistance to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and the Palestinian Authority respectively. To solve the urgent needs of food, medical care, housing and other needs in the Gaza Strip. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a new round of conflict between Palestine and Israel continues, the number of casualties on both sides is also rising. As of October 15, local time, the conflict had killed more than 4,100 people on both sides. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Weijian, a researcher at the Foreign Policy Institute of the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, told Southern Weekend reporters that Israel&#39;s &quot;retaliatory actions&quot; will continue for a period of time. &quot;Hamas&#39; actions are humiliating to Israel, so Israel needs to get a psychological balance.&quot; He believes that Israel will use this power to eliminate Hamas on a regular basis. &quot;In fact, he is already doing this.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Urban Street Fighting&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;UNRWA&quot; intern Wu Chenyu on October 12 She received an email stating that &quot;11 staff members of the agency (Gaza office) were killed.&quot; Although she already knew the news, she still felt very sad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Chenyu is an intern at the agency’s Jordan office. She told Southern Weekend reporters that the agency’s headquarters manages five field offices, namely Lebanon, Gaza, the West Bank, Syria and Jordan. The Jordanian relief office where she works has not been affected by the war yet, &quot;but other field offices such as Gaza, staff have been informed to evacuate.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later on October 14, Hamas sent a message to Israel Rocket attacks were launched in Tel Aviv and surrounding areas, the central city of Bat Yam, the southern city of Ashkelon and other places. According to outside analysis, no one on either side of Palestine or Israel can predict exactly what will happen in the ground war. Hamas has proven that it can survive in previous Israeli-Palestinian conflicts and has &quot;powerful weapons suitable for street fighting.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Qassan Brigades, an armed faction affiliated with Hamas, released information to the Israeli military on the 14th that the organization was &quot;fully prepared&quot; for &quot;any ground military operations&quot; by the Israeli army. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Gaza Strip covers an area of ​​approximately 360 square kilometers, with dense population and numerous houses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, Hamas claimed to have built 500 kilometers of tunnels. Many experts and scholars believe that the tunnel network will make street fighting more difficult. Once the Israeli army and Hamas start &quot;urban street fighting&quot; there, both sides will suffer higher casualties than in the first few days of this round of Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and will have a negative impact on the Israeli army. pose a fatal threat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There are two levels in the Gaza Strip, one for civilians and the other for Hamas.&quot; An IDF spokesman said on October 12 that these tunnels are just &quot;bunkers for Hamas&quot; ” so that they can continue to plot cross-border operations and fire rockets into Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many media reports revealed that this &quot;maze-like huge underground tunnel network&quot; was built 30 meters underground in Gaza, with the entrance hidden on the ground floor of houses, schools and other public buildings. It is used for Hama Sri Lanka transports personnel, supplies, stores ammunition, etc., while avoiding Israeli artillery shells and reconnaissance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few days, Israel has continued to launch air strikes on Gaza. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But a week after the conflict broke out, Hamas was still able to fire rockets into Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The outside world believes that this is because the rockets hidden in the tunnels can be moved at any time. Saleh al-Arouri, one of the military leaders of Hamas, said before the outbreak of this round of Palestinian-Israeli conflict, &quot;Hamas&#39;s defensive plan is more powerful than its offensive plan.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;I don&#39;t think Israeli soldiers have the ability to attack these tunnels.&quot; Shaul, a Palestinian historian at Tel Aviv University&#39;s Middle East and African Studies Center, said, but Israel &quot;will find a way to smoke out Hamas.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Xiaolin, director of the Mediterranean Research Institute at Zhejiang University of International Studies, believes that Israel cannot and will not completely eliminate Hamas. He said that Hamas has grown from small to large, and there is no lack of &quot;contribution&quot; to Israel for allowing it to grow to fight against the mainstream faction of the PLO. Retaining the Gaza Strip as the so-called &quot;Hamastan&quot; can continue to divide, weaken, and internally divide the Palestinian camp and benefit Israeli strategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Revenge and scruples&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“I never imagined that this journey would be like this.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Have successfully returned from Israel Rao Pingman from China recalls her escape from Israel as if it was yesterday. After waiting for 15 hours at Tel Aviv Airport, Ms. Rao boarded a plane from Tel Aviv to Ethiopia on the morning of October 8, and then returned to China via the Ethiopia-Bangkok-Hong Kong route. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, in retaliation for Hamas, the Israeli army has launched multiple rounds of air strikes in the Gaza Strip. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Israel Defense Forces publicly stated on the afternoon of October 16 that the head of Hamas’s intelligence agency was killed in an assassination operation by the Israeli army. Currently, Hamas has no response. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Israel Defense Forces also stated in a statement that the Israeli army has completed the mobilization of hundreds of thousands of reservists, and the logistics department is working hard to ensure the supply of weapons and equipment for ground troops. He also stated that the equipment needed for the battle has been moved to the assembly area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a &quot;counterattack&quot; operation, Israel&#39;s actions can be called &quot;all-round&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 14, the Israel Defense Forces announced that it would implement a more extensive ground military action plan in the Gaza Strip and expand its offensive in the Gaza Strip, including launching &quot;joint and coordinated attacks by air, sea and land.&quot; Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu previously threatened that the Israeli army would &quot;destroy Hamas&quot; through a ground offensive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Israel Defense Forces stated that Israeli soldiers are preparing for &quot;major ground operations&quot; and that the Israeli army will implement an &quot;extensive ground offensive plan&quot; in the Gaza Strip to expand the offensive, including the implementation of &quot;air, sea and joint coordinated attack on land.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Weijian believes that Israel&#39;s mentality at this time is not determined to fight a &quot;win or lose&quot; battle, but that Israel believes that the losses suffered this time are too great, so Hamas must pay the price and double the price. revenge. &quot;Under this mentality, Israel will definitely do more in retaliation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the night of October 12 to the early morning of October 13, the Israeli army attacked about 750 Hamas and other organizations in the Gaza Strip. Air strikes were carried out against targets. These include tunnels, military compounds, residences used as military command centers for senior members, weapons warehouses, communications rooms and 12 buildings housing Hamas assets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the 11th, the day before that, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave a televised speech that night. He vowed to &quot;crush and destroy&quot; Hamas militants, saying that the Every member of the organization is a &quot;dead person.&quot; The Israeli army also attacked two Hamas military bases in the Gaza Strip. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In one of the compounds, the headquarters of the commander of Hamas&#39;s northern division was destroyed, and a military infrastructure building belonging to the Hamas naval unit was also attacked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Israel Defense Forces stated that since the Palestinian-Israeli conflict broke out on October 7, the Israeli army has arrested more than 330 Palestinians in the West Bank, including more than 100 people related to Hamas. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, many experts and scholars told Southern Weekend reporters that Israel&#39;s &quot;counterattack&quot; actions will not expand indefinitely. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Xiaolin judged that once the Gaza Strip, known as the &quot;hornet&#39;s nest&quot; and the &quot;damned strip&quot; by the Israelis, is included in the territory, Israel will once again bear a heavy burden of international law, morality, public opinion, economy, demographic structure and security. It will also put an end to the reconciliation process with Arab countries that has made significant progress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Israel also has many concerns.&quot; Li Weijian analyzed that if Israel excessively causes a humanitarian crisis or kills many civilians, it will eventually arouse the anger of the Arab world. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Hurt each other&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After Israel&#39;s &quot;evacuation order&quot; was issued, residents of northern Gaza began to flee to the south, looking for shelter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In videos circulating on social media, residents of Wuyangyang stuffed their belongings into pickup trucks and cars. Some residents had to squeeze onto flatbed trucks pulled by livestock and move with difficulty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some residents refused to leave and stayed in the collapsed and dilapidated houses. Speaking to the cameras, they said that while their homeland might be fraught with dangers, leaving would be &quot;turning back the land and history.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a new round of conflict broke out, Said Shoaib&#39;s family had to go from the Brei refugee camp near the Israeli border to the Deir al-Balah refugee camp. He continues to document it on social media. He said, &quot;There is no safe place in Gaza. Israel tells people to go to the south, but they are still bombing in the south.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under Israel&#39;s &quot;blockade&quot;, World Health Organization spokesperson Jassa Revi Qi said Gaza&#39;s hospitals were running out of medical supplies and beds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs released news on October 13, stating that since the outbreak of the new round of Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the number of displaced people in the Gaza Strip has exceeded 420,000. United Nations agencies have called for funds to provide aid to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meanwhile, the Israeli government released &quot;horrific photos of babies being killed and burned by Hamas monsters.&quot; The three photos were posted on the social media accounts of Netanyahu&#39;s office. But Hamas denies the accusations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Ran, who has now fled to Turkey, moved into the shelter of his school in Israel with his luggage when a new round of conflicts broke out. He told Southern Weekend reporters that the place has complete water, electricity and internet connections and is safer than other shelters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The battlefield is mainly concentrated in the south. In the central part where I am, except for a few thousand rockets on the first day, the number of rockets decreased thereafter, and even buses and trains were restored the next day.&quot; Yang Ran revealed , because Israelis may have one or two rocket attacks every year, they are &quot;relatively accustomed to it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The size of the economic damage to Israel will depend on how long these reservists are away from work.” Eyal Winter, an economics professor at Israel’s Hebrew University, said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the outbreak of the conflict, the Israel Defense Forces has called up many reservists to perform tasks. These reservists come from all walks of life. They are separated from daily economic production activities and go into battle. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;The quagmire of &quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Multi-front operations&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Currently, Israel has fully &quot;blocked&quot; Hamas-controlled areas In the Gaza Strip, water and electricity supplies were cut off. The move has the United Nations concerned about an exacerbation of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged all parties to allow the United Nations to provide humanitarian assistance to the Gaza Strip. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a United States that is &quot;busy on both sides&quot;, it has made frequent &quot;big moves&quot; since the Palestinian-Israeli conflict escalated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The U.S. White House announced on October 16 that after visiting Israel on October 18, U.S. President Biden will go to the Jordanian capital Amman to meet with Jordanian King Abdullah II and Egyptian President Sisi. Met with Palestinian President and Palestinian National Liberation Movement (Fatah) Chairman Mahmoud Abbas to discuss conflict-related matters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 14, US Secretary of Defense Austin ordered the &quot;Eisenhower&quot; aircraft carrier strike group to head to the Eastern Mediterranean. He said this was &quot;part of efforts to contain the expansion of the war.&quot; Biden publicly stated that the White House is quickly &quot;providing additional security assistance such as ammunition and missile interception systems&quot; to Israel. He urged the U.S. Congress to take urgent action to approve funds to meet the security needs of the United States&#39; &quot;key partners&quot; including Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The United States sends an aircraft carrier fleet to support Israel and deter Iran and Hezbollah, but it will not actively intervene in the Gaza war and create enemies on all sides in the Middle East, and it does not want to get stuck in the quagmire of the Middle East again.” Zhejiang International Studies University’s Mediterranean Research Ma Xiaolin, the dean of the hospital, said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this conflict, Iran, which was speculated to be a &quot;supporter&quot; of Hamas, held its first meeting with senior Hamas officials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of the 14th local time, Iranian Foreign Minister Abdullahiyan met with Hamas leader Haniyeh in Doha, the capital of Qatar. He called on Israel not to launch a ground attack on the Gaza Strip. He also warned that if the Lebanese Hezbollah joins the conflict, this round of conflicts may further expand to other regions in the Middle East, which will cause Israel to suffer huge losses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When will this cycle of violent fighting stop? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Marzouk, a member of the Hamas Political Bureau, said on October 10 that Hamas &quot;has achieved its goals&quot; and is open to discussing &quot;similar things&quot; and &quot;all political dialogue&quot; about a ceasefire. The Qatar Al Jazeera website reported that Hamas has captured a sufficient number of Israeli soldiers, but Hamas will only be willing to discuss the issue of prisoner exchange after the war is over. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is noteworthy that conflicts also broke out in the border areas between Israel and Lebanon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Lebanese National News Agency reported that on October 15, local time, Israel launched an artillery bombardment on the southern Lebanese border town of Al-Dhahira, causing complete disruption of public road traffic. It is generally believed that if the situation on the Lebanese-Israeli border escalates further, Israel may face a &quot;second front&quot; in the north. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Xiaolin said that the main battlefield of this conflict has been moved to the Gaza Strip. No matter how large the casualties are, the war will not spill over to the four countries of Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, and Syria. &quot;Coupled with the first phone call between the heads of state of Saudi Arabia and Iran to discuss the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, this shows that the regional identity politics game once led by both parties will not be repeated, and the Palestinian issue may continue to be marginalized.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Next, Israel will still take future development into consideration.&quot; Li Weijian analyzed that Israel has to deal with Middle Eastern countries and Arab countries, and it also hopes to maintain the situation it has finally opened and improve the development of relations with other countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mao Ning, spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, called on the top priority to cool down the situation, cease fire and violence, protect civilians, and avoid humanitarian disasters. When dealing with international and regional hot-spot issues, major countries should adhere to objectivity and fairness, maintain calmness and restraint. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(At the request of the interviewee, Rao Pingman and Yang Ran are pseudonyms)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 18 Oct 2023 15:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[今年前三季度中国GDP同比增长5.2%]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258794]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-18 14:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on the 18th showed that preliminary calculations showed that China’s gross domestic product (GDP) in the first three quarters ) 91.3027 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 5.2% at constant prices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at quarters, GDP grew by 4.5% year-on-year in the first quarter, 6.3% in the second quarter, and 4.9% in the third quarter.

Among them: 1 Secretary-General of the State Council, 9 Deputy Secretary-Generals of the State Council (including part-time ones), and 43 department-level leadership positions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What are the responsibilities of the Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Working Rules of the State Council&quot; revised in March this year clearly mentioned that the State Council implements the prime minister&#39;s responsibility system. Under the leadership of the Prime Minister, the Secretary-General is responsible for handling the daily work of the State Council, and the Deputy Secretary-General assists the Secretary-General in his work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It mentioned that “the General Office of the State Council must carefully review and review the official documents submitted by various regions and departments to the State Council for review and approval. It involves the issuance of administrative normative documents in the name of the State Council or the General Office of the State Council, If administrative normative documents are issued in the name of a department after being submitted to the State Council for approval, the judicial administrative department of the State Council shall conduct a legality review. For matters that have disagreements between departments, the leading comrades of the State Council in charge of the sponsoring department shall take the lead in strengthening coordination. The Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council shall assist The leading comrades in charge of the State Council shall do a good job in coordination.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the review and review of relevant rules and documents, more specific information can be obtained from some of the concurrent positions held by the Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council. For example, Meng Yang is concurrently the deputy director of the State Council&#39;s Working Committee on Disabled Persons, the deputy leader of the State Council&#39;s First National Comprehensive Natural Disaster Risk Survey Leading Group, and the deputy convener of the State Council&#39;s inter-ministerial joint conference system for optimizing family planning policies. Liu Jianbo concurrently serves as deputy director of the National Narcotics Control Commission. Wang Yonghong concurrently serves as Party Secretary and Director of the State Administration of Institutional Affairs. In addition, Guo Wei is also a member of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People&#39;s Political Consultative Conference and a member of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Committee. Liu Jianbo is a member of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People&#39;s Political Consultative Conference and a member of the Ethnic and Religious Affairs Committee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 18 Oct 2023 13:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[对话许知远：梁启超和他诞生150年后的世界]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258769]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-18 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Liang Qichao is our &quot;familiar stranger&quot;. In China, almost no one knows his name, but his vague image is limited to a reformist politician, the author of &quot;Young China&quot;, and a father who raised many outstanding children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liang Qichao was born in Chakeng Village, Xinhui County, Guangzhou Prefecture in 1873. In &quot;Autobiography at Thirty&quot;, Liang Qichao used major events in Chinese and world history to find coordinates for the year of his birth: it was the tenth year after the fall of the Taiping Rebellion, one year after Zeng Guofan&#39;s death, and the third year after the Franco-Prussian War ended. Of course, when he was born, the chronology was the twelfth year of Tongzhi, Guiyou. The AD calendar was not widely adopted until the founding of New China. It was through Liang Qichao that the sayings of the 19th and 20th centuries spread in the Chinese-speaking world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liang Qichao was one of the first Chinese to realize the turn of the century. At the beginning of 1900, he wrote &quot;The Song of the Pacific in the Twentieth Century&quot;, predicting that the new century would usher in the Pacific Age. Chinese people in the 19th century did not realize that they were in the 19th century. Only in the 20th century will we look back with the help of new historical coordinates to describe this era of sinking, humiliation and endeavor, and salvation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1898, after the failure of the Hundred Days Reform, Liang Qichao went into exile in Japan and traveled around the world. After the founding of the Republic of China, Liang Qichao returned to China, and the main stages of his activities were in the ice drinking rooms in the capital Beijing and Tianjin. For him, his hometown in Guangdong has become as far away as his boyhood. But this does not mean that he bid farewell to his hometown. In fact, many of Liang Qichao&#39;s activities in Yokohama, Japan, North America and Australia relied on the huge support of the overseas Chinese network in Guangdong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/YH8F41xHIdF3FC0Vzqv5AIn8UTkKPK3nlVfGX4Ax.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;在日本期间的梁启超。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（资料图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“假如我们把眼光放在大历史中没有名字的那些人身上，会发现从十九世纪中叶开始，已经有大量的广东人去了北美和日本，蒸汽轮船的使用，使广东侨民不再只是下南洋，而是横跨太平洋来到世界各地。”《地域文化与国家认同：晚清以来广东文化观的形成》的作者程美宝教授告诉南方周末记者，“太平洋沿岸各个埠头，都有广东人的踪影，他们在异国建立起会馆、庙宇、同乡会，或是用公司的方式组织自己，所以当康梁、孙中山等人在海外活动的时候，就会有人给他接头，安排住宿和行程。这些历史名人的活动，背后是无名的群体数十年的铺垫。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;许多人曾尝试为梁启超作传，民国历史学家吴其昌写过半本，到戊戌变法为止；解玺璋的《梁启超传》，以梁氏与不同历史人物的交往与关系进行分章；作家魏微在出版长篇小说《烟霞里》之前，曾花了数年时间写梁启超传记，写到十几万字时，她觉得头绪太繁杂，便放了下来，先去从事小说创作了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年是梁启超150周年诞辰，许知远的《梁启超》第二部也出版面世。第一部的标题是《青年变革者》，写1873年到1898年的梁启超，于2019年出版。许知远原本计划分三部写完，现在写作计划已扩充到了五部，第二部《亡命》从1898年写到1903年，庞杂的历史线索、众多与梁氏交汇的人物，都让许知远觉得，有必要把他的版本的梁启超传扩容。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“所有人都是同时代人。”许知远这样提示他的写作以及每一位读者进入梁启超的世界的方式。梁启超并不仅仅属于昨天，也许他还属于未来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《梁启超》第二部的编辑罗丹妮告诉南方周末记者：“许知远的写作脉络跟史家学者有不同，并非是为回应特定学术史脉络中的一个问题，而是出于一种很纯粹的，一个人对另外一个人的好奇心。就是对另外一个也同样身处新旧交替、未可知的巨变时期的读书人，他怎么面对变局，参与其中，产生好奇。所以他的写作是一种将心比心的、有代入感的写作。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年9月，南方周末记者在杭州大运河边的单向空间专访许知远。许知远十分繁忙，除了《十三邀》的节目录制，他正辗转于各个城市进行新书的推广。当记者问到，如何去平衡书中梁启超的思想轨迹与社会图景时，许知远说：“有时候会觉得时代写太多了，时代压倒了个体，有时候又觉得个体写多了，缺少时代的映照，这是一个不断去寻找的过程。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/nlIotn1FEjTnSnyYbRhNNETePlneXvpjW1cgOyTs.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年9月，许知远在杭州谈梁启超。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（南瓜视业供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我特别希望跟传主梁启超一起进行思想的冒险，你也不知道下一步会发生什么事情。我目前只写到第二卷，他的思想仍然在继续演变，我不愿意用后见之明来评价他的思想是不是已经成熟了，那段时间他就产生了这样一种思想状况。我想尽量回到历史现场，去创造某种可能性。这套书的写作过程，并不是说我已经经过20年研究，深思熟虑了，对他有很多的理解，才开始动笔来书写它，不是的。我的理解会随着写作的进行不断加深，比如我写到第二卷，就比第一卷更理解他一些，写到第三卷可能比第二卷更理解他一些。但也有可能，写完最后一卷的时候，会意识到最初对他的思想理解得不太准确，因为这是更大的一个框架。”许知远对南方周末记者说。某种意义上，梁启超的世界已经是许知远的平行宇宙。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;像做拼图一样，构建梁启超的世界&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;之前有一些从思想史角度来讨论梁启超的著作，比如美国学者列文森的《梁启超与中国近代思想》、张灏的《梁启超与中国思想的过渡（1890—1907）》等，而你写梁启超传，主要的兴趣是要描述梁启超那一代人经历的社会转型，你觉得这两种写作的主要区别是什么？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;列文森和张灏先生的书是最初影响我对梁启超的兴趣的著作，对我有思想启蒙的意义。列文森把梁启超放在一个更大的范畴里，来看待他在中国传统中扮演的角色，用短短的篇幅涵盖他的一生。张灏先生的书主要是讨论1907年以前梁启超的思想历程。大约十年前，我还在美国华盛顿见过张灏先生，去他家做客，一起吃了个夫妻肺片。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;它们是思想式的传记，而我想写的，是一个更多以人为中心展开，兼具文学性、历史性，某种意义上具有百科全书色彩的书。我花了很多笔墨不仅写梁启超，也写他的同代人，写他背后整个时代的精神，写整个中国的变化，日本的变化，世界的变化，所以它更像“梁启超和他的时代”。我希望把梁启超看作全球现代性转变过程中的一个代表人物，他不仅属于中国的传统，也属于亚洲乃至世界的传统，因此我要去描绘他背后的生活空间和场景。我大量地写了他作为一个行动者的部分，他不仅是一个思想者，更重要的还是一个行动者。我想用现代意义上的传记写作的方式，给他更多的立体性的展示。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;如果要更多分析他的思想轨迹，就会增加论述的部分，你的写作方式是尽量用史料说话，很少论述，这是出于什么考虑？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我尽量不去破坏叙事节奏，叙事有一个乐感也好，一个逻辑也好，我尽量遵循叙事本身的结构，人物慢慢随着每一卷的进行，在每一页纸上变得丰满鲜活起来，他有自己的性格，我并不能完全操纵和规定，而他的性格又是由那些现实的材料，可能加上我的某种重组材料的想象力共同构成的。我的主观性是在序言里完成的，一旦进入正文写作，我希望把主观情绪藏在文字后面。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;在阅读刚刚出版的梁启超传第二部《亡命》以及前几年出版的《青年变革者》时，读者的很大一部分乐趣，在于通过你的书写，可以建立起对一百多年前的一部分中国人生活经验的感知。比如清末广东的读书人进京赶考，不是走陆路，而是走海路，一般要在上海停留中转，所以上海自然地成了他们的一个活动舞台；比如到了北京，会住在同乡会馆。搜集这些材料时，遇到了哪些困难？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;收集材料，一个是要去想象他的生活空间，比如说梁启超经常会被抽象成一个简单的思想人物，当然这也很重要，但是他不仅生活在一个思想的语境中，也生活在现实的语境中，他不仅是个思想者，还是那个时代重要的见证者和参与者，所以对我来说，创造那个时代背景变得非常重要。只有更理解那个时代的背景，才更容易理解他的行动的杰出和困难之处在哪里。所以我花很多精力去构建时代空间，去理解当年一个秀才或举人怎么进京赶考，一个读书人他们日常生活是什么样子的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;只有你更理解一个读书人的日常生活，比如说他在学海堂读什么样的作品，才会理解他突然要到日本，进入西方语境的思想脉络是多么非比寻常。所以我就要描绘读书人的日常，在广州、在北京是什么状况，在会馆里怎么跟人交往，要靠当年的日记、笔记，一些看起来跟梁启超毫不相关的记录，来创造一个世界。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这方面我很受史景迁的影响，你看他写《王氏之死》，王氏没有什么记载，但他通过蒲松龄的小说来想象当年山东是什么样的，当年清王朝的生活气氛。我也大量凭借这种笔记，甚至当时的小说，去构造这样的气氛，包括其他考生对日常的记载，第二卷更是要创造19世纪末到20世纪初一个东京的、横滨的、墨尔本的时空，还要在这个世界里穿梭。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我年轻时喜欢看各种杂书，杂书的作用就在这里。比如我看过很多澳大利亚历史的书，然后写作的时候，去描述1900年的悉尼，要大量搜集当时的报纸文献，可能用上的就寥寥几笔。当时澳大利亚的侨领梅光达是什么样子？温哥华的叶家又是什么状况？都需要通过各种奇怪的资料，像做拼图一样，可能并不完整，尽量多拼一点是一点。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;比如你写梁启超跟他妻子的关系，还有他在夏威夷一段没有结果的爱情，这方面材料就很少，一方面他是一个早熟的文化明星，有着与年龄不相称的社会声望，另一方面他好像是一个不需要儿女私情的人，妻子很少随他出行或陪在他身边。今天的读者就很难理解这一点。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;那是一个男性为中心的时代，对于这些以天下为己任的读书人，家庭尽管很重要，但往往被他们的叙述忽略，留下的记载很少。包括海外的唐人街，基本也是一个男性的世界，除了侨领有可能把太太带在身边，大部分人的家眷都留在广东、福建的家乡。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;梁启超一直在世界各地颠沛流离，有很大的情感空缺，他会把自己的焦灼、孤独和挫败，在诗里流露，他写了24首情诗，描绘对何小姐强烈的情感，放在这样一个时空里，他的情感才会容易理解。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;康有为的情感就更丰富了，他一路流亡，娶了不同的太太，有各种艳遇。而梁启超妻子的哥哥是他的考官，这是一个对他有恩的家庭，然后因为他的行动，使妻子和全家卷入到危险和慌乱之中，他有很多负疚在里面。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;可不可以说，梁启超是一个比较禁欲的人？张灏那本书谈到“克己”，克己也包含了禁欲的一面。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;梁启超的情感非常丰沛，同时又很自律，他的热情、欲望在行动和写作中已经得到了非常大幅度的展现。你想，他写了那么多作品，在短时间内做了那么多事，从政治组织到创办杂志，涉及的领域从政治经济学到如何写小说，什么都有。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;众多人的心理动机，构成了历史的动力&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你说梁启超可能是中国最早的环球旅行者，但中国文人没有关注旅途中的衣食住行、风土、景观这些细节的习惯。你是通过哪些手段来补充这些细节的？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;他自己写过一部分，横跨太平洋的晕船，在纽约、美国的见闻。我还需要去翻阅当年的报纸，要看美国史、澳洲史怎么描述当时的国家和社会的面貌，跟梁启超的个人见闻、感受混在一起，共同形成他眼中的世界的样子。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;梁启超之前，黄遵宪也随着他的外交活动，在日本、美国、新加坡长期生活。广东华侨的网络在他们的游历中发挥了什么作用？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;太平洋两岸的城市聚集了很多广东人，形成了资金和观念的网络，这个网络支撑了近代中国的变革者。如果没有广东人的海外网络，许多事情都不会发生，康梁也无法扮演这么重要的角色。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;那为什么这些变革者没有诞生在福建？福建人海外移民也很多。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;一方面跟杰出人物的诞生有关，另一方面香港发挥了重要的作用，香港是一个新思想的辐射地，同时广州也是一个文化中心，香港与广州之间形成了有趣的文化张力和文化动力。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;梁启超在澳洲和美国的旅行最吸引你的地方是什么？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;是他与当地社会的互动，如何去激发当地人对他的政治理念的兴趣和热情，所以我花了很多时间去寻找当地华人对梁启超的反应是什么。我非常开心找到了一个材料，梁启超在西雅图演讲时，正好一个日本留学生记录下了华人剧院里大家欣赏梁启超演讲的盛况，这种描述对我来说非常重要。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另一个我感兴趣的地方是不同的华人世界之间的区别。比如新金山墨尔本、旧金山圣弗朗西斯科、温哥华，每个城市的华人社区都有各自的特性，这些特性也会反映在他们对流亡者的态度里。包括华人社会内部的分歧和紧张，富有的商人想从保皇会当中获得什么，普通人想得到什么，每个人都有复杂的心理动机，这些心理动机就构成了历史的动力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你对今天的海外华人有什么新的观察？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;能看到叠加的移民浪潮，他们会留下不同的遗产，一方面还有广东人构成的老式的唐人街；另一方面，从饮食上可以看出变化，现在海外的中餐不仅有粤菜，还有越来越多的川菜。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;那个时代的旅行最主要的交通方式是轮船，海运的风险、漫长的时间、晕船的痛苦，是今天的旅行者很难体会的了。你有过长距离乘坐轮船的经历或计划吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;没有，也很难有了。那个时候的时间感跟我们现在不一样，他们可能认为一个月坐船穿越大洋是很正常的一件事情。因为他们没有飞机。时间感都是相对的，对他们来说坐船比如10天能够从横滨到夏威夷已经是非常快的。梁启超经历了地球突然缩小、速度加快的时代，他可以这么短的时间里，去很多不同的州，不同的国家，这是一个崭新的体验。时间感的变化、现代性的变化，对梁启超思想的形成是非常重要的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;今天的读者要理解梁启超那个时代，最大的隔膜和困难在什么地方？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我觉得对日常生活的理解可能还没有那么难，毕竟日常生活的节奏虽然有差异，但也没有那么难把握。他的思想变化是非常难理解的，他要突然从一个四书五经的，或者仅仅从《万国公报》上看到外部世界的只言片语的一个年轻人，进入明治晚期的日本，面对那么多不同的思想的冲击，从社会达尔文主义到自由主义、君主立宪，还有小说、科学、经济学，所有这些东西涌来，他怎么去理解这样一个世界的新，那种思想的爆炸。当然我们现在也处在一个技术巨变的时代，有很多陌生的名词不知道，但是我们毕竟受过一些现代教育的训练，至少这些新的变化是沿着现代教育的基础和脉络进行的，梁启超他们受的是传统教育，这种巨大冲击的思想感受，是很难去描述的一个过程。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就像你受的是牛顿力学的训练，突然把你扔进量子力学的世界，那是怎样一种感觉？我们在描绘这样的思想变化的时候，不能都是后见之明，认为那些名词已经是固定的常识了，那些名词本身是梁启超他们创造出来的，通过对日语的翻译，琢磨这个新词是不是可用的，甚至是来不及想太多就要赶紧开始使用了，要给别人讲述，我觉得那是非常慌乱的过程。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;写梁启超传，一个很大的悖论或挑战是，今天我们中国人运用的很多观念、词汇，本来是经由梁启超创造的，却要用他创造的词像“咬尾蛇”一样去复述他。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;所以怎么回到当时的陌生感是一个问题，我希望描绘思想变化的过程，不是已经固化的思想本身。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;换句话说，除了“同时代性”，我们与一百多年前，也存在文明范式的巨大差异，这个差异首先就体现在我们的教育、我们与传统的关系上。或许呈现这种细微又无处不在的差异，是一个巨大的挑战？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;必须要运用一些想象力和同理心。当然，想象力有它的局限，在写作过程中，误读是一定会发生的。可能误读本身也是历史给我们的很重要的一个动力。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;在2023年写梁启超传，它一定是2023年的人写的。到了2053年，可以有另外的人去写。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;一定是带着这一代人的问题意识，包括选择什么资料，一定是触发了你此刻的心情的材料，才会选择它。所以它带着强烈的当下性，有点像翻译。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;有一种翻译的观念就是说，文学经典应当每隔五十年重译一次，每次重译，一定是使用这个时代的文学语汇、日常语言。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;对梁启超这样的人物，他确实应该不断地被重新书写。不光是梁启超，严复、蔡元培这些现代中国之父，都值得每一代人重新书写。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;回到梁启超是我们的同时代人这种说法，我们今天援引梁启超也好，回到鲁迅也好，都是在回应当下我们对许多问题没有答案的一种困境？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;思想需要历史的维度，如果没有历史的维度，你的思想会非常轻飘或者说无根。所以写作它的时候，当然是对当下的某种回应，同时也是为当下的问题寻找某种历史的脉络和框架。在这个历史的框架之中，你就更容易理解当下的感受。对我来说，所有的时空都是交错的，其实梁启超的影响并没有消失，它仍然弥漫在我们的生活里。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;中国应该有一种综合思想性和文学性的历史写作&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;梁启超面对巨变和各种棘手的思想难题的抉择，给了你哪些启发？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;没有机会深思熟虑，每个人都要在一个信息不充分的情况下展开行动。我喜欢他身上那种行动的精神。行动也是一种思想方式，行动会不断确认思想的局限性和可能性。梁启超对我最强的触动，就是让行动来验证或者拓展思想。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;梁启超会比较推崇王阳明，而不是朱熹。梁启超觉得王阳明的知行合一的精神，对日本江户末期到明治维新的变革者产生了巨大的影响。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;因为王阳明是对个人主体性的一种释放。然后个人能够进行自我塑造，这种能力是非常大的，可以直接影响环境与时代，鼓舞很多胸怀大志的人。梁启超肯定深受此影响，因为他在一个流亡的状态，一切都充满不确定，个人的能动性就变得至关重要。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;梁启超是一个学者、媒体工作者，也是一个教育家、作者，他的哪一种身份最吸引你？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;对，还有个身份是政治家。我觉得他首先是一个书写者，他的其他行动都在不断地展开，那些角色对他也非常重要，但写作者是能最充分地展现他的一切、施展他的才能的一个角色。梁启超是百科全书派的写作者，一个转型时代的启蒙思想家，他的写作就像日本的福泽谕吉，或者法国启蒙运动时期的伏尔泰、卢梭、狄德罗，触及方方面面，可以用文字发挥很直接的政治和社会的影响力。他的时代也在经历中国各种现代学科形成的过程，梁启超卷入其中，然后他又有中国文人士大夫的那种风采，在这样一个过渡时代，他的写作是非常混杂的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你有很多媒体工作经历，会对梁启超编报刊杂志特别感兴趣吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;写一本传记，传主当然会潜移默化影响你。梁启超和我隔了一百年，他是1873出生，我是1976年，可能会有一种潜意识的呼应。但我更感兴趣的，是从19世纪到20世纪，中国剧烈转型、进入现代世界的过程中，梁启超是一个精神世界的代表，他广泛的社会参与也提供了样本的丰富性。接下来我还想写李鸿章的传记，他的性格和经历跟我就完全不一样了，我希望描述那个历史舞台，19世纪中国进入世界舞台过程中的困境，以及个人的失败。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;梁启超是19世纪到20世纪的桥梁，李鸿章是中国19世纪的挽歌。你主编过《东方历史评论》，《东方历史评论》很关注中国与周边的历史、中国海外移民，写近代历史人物的传记，也是这种兴趣的延伸吧？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;写完梁启超传、李鸿章传，我还想写林语堂传，他们三个人分别代表了中国人的power（权力）、idea（观念）、identity（身份），估计可以写到八十岁了。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我一直很喜欢这样一个杂志的样式，介于学院和大众媒体之间的载体，非常有可读性，但背后有很强的学术背景，题材也非常广泛。我对历史一直有强烈的热情，受史景迁的影响，我觉得应该有一种综合思想性和文学性的历史写作。历史和传记写作应该是我们的一种非常重要的知识成果。有的时代是诗歌的时代，有的时代是小说的时代，有的时代可能是散文或旅行写作的时代，我希望还有一些时代是属于历史和传记写作的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你说在日本开单向空间，也是写梁启超传的副产品，在外国开书店有哪些困难？尤其日本是一个书店和出版业很发达、自成体系的国家。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;说副产品其实是开玩笑，我是2020年因为疫情困在日本，就想做点事情，结果我在东京的房东成了书店的合伙人。日本书店虽然很多，但是没有很好的当代的中文书店，东京的单向空间百分之七十是中文书，然后也有日文、英文、韩文书，所以它也是一个亚洲书店的概念。就像中国的单向一样，它会提供沙龙活动，是个交流的场所。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;困难当然也不少，在银座找个地方是很不容易的，成本也相对高，它的商业逻辑我也还没想清楚。中国的单向空间，我们是品牌的输出和管理方，不是靠零售来盈利，更像一个综合意义上的文化公司。在东京不是这种商业逻辑，还要看能不能持续支撑下去，所以它是一个很鲁莽的产物。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;清末民国的书店往往兼有出版的功能，也是一个新信息的集散中心，你有通过单向空间呼应这一传统的考虑吗？在当下的移动互联网时代，书店扮演了什么特殊的角色？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;书店不仅是知识储存的物理空间，也是人员聚合、知识流动、观念生产的地方，它其实是一个精神的公共体，社区的支持很重要。我们东京店就在推一个会员计划，希望会员能找到共同体的感觉。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;某种意义上说，图书和纸媒已经被称为夕阳行业，你在流媒体上做的《十三邀》，更有对应于梁启超时代的新媒体的属性，你怎么看待这两者对你不同的意义？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;其实它们本质上并没有那么大的区别，都是思想的表达。当然不同的媒介有不同媒介的特性，比如书写是更古老的一个媒介，它跟我个人内心，跟我的思想有更密切的关系。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;拍视频是团队的产物，它能够表现我的某一部分，但经常是集体的表达。公司也是，在公司我就是其中的一个创始人或者是灵魂人物，但它的整个运转经常超出我的控制范围，甚至是个逐渐失控的过程。写书是能够自己控制的行为。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对中国的士大夫来说，可能就自己印一些诗文集，所以到了梁启超那代人，杂志、报纸就是他们的超级新媒体，每十天就能出一期新的，有上万人可以看到，这种冲击是非常直接的，很快形成一个共振效应。梁启超大部分文章是在报纸、杂志上发表，真的就像现在做直播和视频一样。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;而且梁启超也面临了失控的情况，比如跟汪康年产生矛盾等等。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;对，然后他又被会计骗了，集资也不顺利。他也要考虑经营的问题、营收的压力，给股东派息，要面对印刷厂起火了怎么办。大家往往忽略了一点，梁启超是个连续创业者，办完《清议报》办《新民丛报》，然后又办《新小说》、广智书局，而且他都找到了投资，以编辑和主笔的身份，占二到四成股份。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;梁启超主要是一个写作者和编辑，你除了内容产出，还有许多商业活动，你会对这些活动对精力的占用感到困扰吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;有时候当然会分散精力，但有时候也是相互促进，因为当你拍节目或者去参与公司的很多事情的时候，经常会挫败，涣散，当然也很兴奋，但是当你写作的时候，就回到更专注的自我，我觉得那是对其他生活的躲避和回避，而你在日常生活面对的一些混乱和失控，也可以把它带到书里，帮你更好地理解梁启超的世界。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;一些历史材料受到了怀疑，我尽量把这种怀疑也呈现出来&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;梁启超通过他大量的写作，创造了一种新的语体，我们现在的文法和语言风格则受到了大量外国译作的影响。有人说你的写作是“翻译体”，你怎么看待这个问题？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我们这代人都受翻译很大的影响，读的很多书是翻译过来的，而且会感到翻译的文体的新颖性。其实梁启超也是翻译体，受到很多日本的影响。更别说五四时期，鲁迅等人的语言。我们白话文的语感就是在翻译的影响下产生的，而且我觉得已经找不到一个纯粹的不受外来语影响的文体。其实最重要的是，你能不能从中找到阅读的快感。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你是一个经验丰富的媒体写作者，非常注重公共写作的可读性，但是写作梁启超传需要参考大量的学术著作和史料。你会不会担心，对于普通读者来说，你的梁启超传太艰涩，对于学界来说，信息密度又不够？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;对学者来说，信息密度也是非常大的。你看我们出版的各种论文，很多也没多大的信息密度。我写梁启超传，用了非常多的新材料，但是我希望它同时有很强的可读性。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;有一些史料，比如冯自由的《革命逸史》，它的可靠性受到了学界的很多质疑，但冯自由的演绎又是很有戏剧性的。对待这一类史料，你是怎么处理的？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;有一些历史材料受到了怀疑，我尽量把它受到的怀疑也呈现出来。尽管冯自由的很多东西有道听途说的成分，但当时很多史料都是道听途说的，甚至说不那么确切的材料，也是构成那个时代场域的重要部分。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;关于梁启超的传说，或者他的同代人的很多传说，也是当时的史料，并没有一个完全纯然的hard fact，就像今天我们俩在这谈话，这中间很多信息在产生，但它并不一定是准确的信息。所以我觉得，要理解历史的这种多样性，对材料本身的引用和怀疑，你给它一个展开的空间，读者自己会感受到的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;梁启超认为，20世纪是民族帝国主义的时代，他后来的思想有浓重的社会达尔文主义的色彩，如何看待他的这种思想倾向对后世产生的影响？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我觉得每一代人要解决每一代人的问题，我们不能要求一代人解决100年之后的问题，有的先知者会看到他的困境是什么，但是对于梁启超那代人来讲，他面临的现实是国家受到羞辱，进入历史的谷底，富强是他们最重要的目标，而他们认为现代民族国家是参与全球竞争的最重要的一种角色，所以他们要去塑造一个现代的民族国家。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;至于它的内在矛盾性，它可能产生的一种压迫性，是逐渐发展出来的，章太炎对这个问题更敏锐。梁启超可能也感受到这部分，但他有他的迫切性，每个思想家的特质是不一样的，所以我们无法去要求每一个思想者既做出迫切的选择，又有长远的观照。韦伯看到了更长远的东西，看到现代性作为铁笼子的一面，他就是更伟大的一个思想家。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然我觉得思想者只能负思想者的责任。历史上一个思想观念的形成，它对我们的影响，不仅来自思想家本身，还来自后来的社会和教育体制的塑造。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;梁启超徘徊于中国的传统文化与西方的知识之间，他的后代也多是考古、航天等领域的专家，而在今天，我们的困境却是学科太过专门化、辖域化，梁启超式的综合性的人文知识分子越来越缺乏。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;随着学科的细分，那种纵横式的思想者，不仅中国，全世界都稀缺。可能当时代发生新的巨大变化，大家就渴望综合性的思想者出现。比如说为什么全球这么多人要读赫拉利的作品，它谈不上多么伟大或深刻，但他具有某种综合性，他对眼前迫切性的问题提出了自己的某种回应，这种回应就会引起大量的注意。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;在大众认知中，梁启超是一个被高度窄化的人，今年是他150周年诞辰，梁启超传当然也是改变公众对他的认识的一个重要努力。你觉得在他卷帙浩繁的著述中，有哪些是最值得被今天的读者阅读的？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;梁启超写了1400万字，非常庞杂，他的经历和作品一样重要。他的思想史著作，关于清代学术三百年，还有《少年中国说》《新民说》这些散文，都值得被不断重读。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;与梁启超相比，大众对鲁迅作品的阅读就要全面得多。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;20世纪是一个革命的世纪，鲁迅是作为一个革命作家被铭记的。梁启超长期以来被认为是维新力量的代表，而维新是被革命叙事所压抑的。其实，在梁启超的时代，他是一位国民作家，从比他年长的人，到他的同代人，再到下一代的陈独秀、毛泽东、胡适，所有人都在读他。此外，梁启超的写作还处在文体转化的过程中，而鲁迅他们已经探索出一种新的白话文的写作方式了。其实，被窄化的不光是梁启超，我们对蔡元培、林语堂的认识也还远远不够，所以我觉得应该有更多写作者加入到重估和重新发现他们的工作中。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;
