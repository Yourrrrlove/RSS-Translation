Because according to general understanding, in nature where natural selection and survival of the fittest occur, same-sex sexual behavior consumes precious energy and time but fails to produce offspring. Such behavior should have been eliminated in evolution, but the reality is that same-sex sexual behavior is still in the process of evolution. There is no shortage of them in nature and human society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Scientists have discovered same-sex behavior in more than 1,500 species of animals. Such behavior is not affected by gender and can occur between two males or two females. It appears in artificial breeding environments and also in the wild. It is not an accidental behavior forced by extreme environments. This also poses a difficult problem for scientists to understand its evolutionary logic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2023, researchers from the University of Granada in Spain and other institutions tried to verify some relevant explanatory hypotheses through germline analysis of a large number of mammal same-sex sexual behavior information. Their latest research, published in Nature Communications, suggests that the evolution of same-sex sexual behavior is likely an adaptation to nature. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Maintaining same-sex social relationships&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“Same-sex sexual behavior occurs in many mammalian species, including our relatives the great apes. Rather than classifying it as maladaptive or abnormal behavior, our study shows that this sexual behavior in mammals is a convergent adaptation that helps maintain social relationships and reduce same-sex conflicts.&quot; Lead author of the latest study, while at the Spanish Arid Zone Experimental Station Function and Evolution José M. Gómez, a professor at the Department of Ecology and the University of Granada, told Southern Weekend reporters that although same-sex sexual behavior occurs in many species, it is especially common among primates. This may Precisely because primates are more social than many other groups of mammals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a data point of view, research has found same-sex sexual behavior in more than 260 species of mammals. In more than 80% of the cases, it takes the form of back crawling or genital contact, and less than 30% Some species even display same-sex behavior through courtship or pairing. Judging from the age, same-sex sexual behavior mainly occurs in adult mammals, and young same-sex sexual behavior is only found in 10 species of animals. From an environmental perspective, more than 80% of the samples had same-sex sexual behavior occurring in wild or semi-wild environments. In terms of gender, same-sex behavior is relatively evenly distributed among mammals. Female same-sex behavior has been recorded in more than 160 species, and male same-sex behavior has been found in more than 190 species. Combined, about half of all species have same-sex behavior. Homosexuality involving two genders at the same time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that the latest study is only based on existing records of same-sex sexual behavior in mammals and does not represent the entire situation of mammals. In fact, because the discovery of same-sex sexual behavior in nature relies on observation, and in some species females and males look very similar, and it is even difficult to distinguish between male and female. Some scientists estimate that the current records of same-sex sexual behavior in nature should be underestimated. Moreover, compared with mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, insects and other invertebrates are either small in size or live far away from the ground, making observation difficult, but they have all recorded same-sex sexual behavior. Therefore, patterns of same-sex sexual behavior in nature are far more complex than what has been observed in mammals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, many hypotheses interpreted same-sex sexual behavior as maladaptive or abnormal behavior, speculating that this behavior may be a manifestation of specific conditions such as incorrect gender identity, lack of opposite-sex peers, or frustration with opposite-sex sexual behavior. From the perspective of sexual behavior scenarios, the latest research has found that same-sex sexual behavior does not necessarily require extremely special occasions. Although same-sex sexual behavior is rare in some species and can only be observed in very special circumstances, for about 40% of the mammals studied, same-sex sexual behavior can be regarded as moderate to high frequency activity during a specific period of time, and during mating Seasons are easy to observe. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Same-sex and opposite-sex coexist&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;And some behavioral observations have long shown that same-sex sexual behavior may play a positive role in some populations. For example, some same-sex behavior among male bottlenose dolphins may help strengthen alliances among small groups, and same-sex behavior among female bonobo groups may promote reconciliation among members. However, the latest study&#39;s germline analysis does not focus on the mechanisms of same-sex sexual behavior in specific species, but uses large-scale statistics to link same-sex sexual behavior to social behavior. This research shows that same-sex sexual behavior is similar to many other behavioral traits that have evolved through natural selection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Professor Jose Gomez reminded that the meaning of same-sex sexual behavior here should be understood within the framework of evolutionary biology, which is still different from the current human society’s views on gender and other related issues. Because in the study of evolutionary biology, same-sex sexual behavior is a temporary behavior of individuals in a certain period of time, not a permanent behavior or life choice. They may also have heterosexual sexual behavior at the same time. Therefore, it cannot be directly related to human society. behavior analogy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In human society, issues related to same-sex sexual behavior are rooted in different cultural environments and historical traditions in different places, and are more complicated to understand. But in recent years, the discussion of distinguishing human same-sex sexual behavior has also attracted the attention of scientists. The core concern is to what extent people who have had same-sex sexual behavior can be defined as homosexual. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, researchers from Harvard University and other institutions published a large-scale genetic study in Science magazine, trying to reveal the genetic characteristics of same-sex sexual behavior, which is the so-called &quot;homosexuality&quot; Gene&quot;. Through collaboration with the British Biobank and genetic testing analysis company 23andMe, researchers finally identified multiple genetic loci related to same-sex sexual behavior from hundreds of thousands of genetic samples, indicating that the &quot;gay gene&quot; is similar to other behavioral traits. It is also polygenic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in 2021, scientists from sex and gender research institutions such as Indiana University’s Kinsey Institute publicly expressed opposition to this research, believing that it only distinguishes people by whether they have had same-sex sexual intercourse. It conflates heterosexuality, bisexuality, and homosexuality, and does not accurately measure people&#39;s sexual behavior, sexual attraction, and sexual identity. Therefore, the genetic characteristics ultimately discovered may not reveal the tendency to have same-sex sexual behavior, but only reveal the preferences. The personality trait of pursuing novelty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because in the view of sexology researchers, heterosexuality should be a continuous pattern of sexual attraction. Just because a person has had same-sex sexual behavior does not mean that he is not heterosexual. Alfred Kinsey, the pioneer of sexology research, developed a scale very early to distinguish people who have had same-sex sexual behavior. According to the frequency of same-sex sexual behavior, people can be divided into multiple types, rather than Either gay or straight. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;It may help reproduction&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The controversy in human society about how to distinguish same-sex sexual behavior from homosexuality also reflects a difficulty in understanding the logic of evolution to a certain extent. Compared with human society, which highly binds concepts such as &quot;same-sex sexual behavior&quot;, &quot;homosexuality&quot; and &quot;no offspring&quot;, same-sex sexual behavior may never mean &quot;no offspring&quot; in the long evolutionary history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Darwin&#39;s paradox of evolution should be put aside; it no longer exists because the existence of bisexual behavior in various animal species ensures that same-sex behavior does not hinder reproductive success.&quot; Empire Vincent Savolainen, a professor at the Department of Life Sciences of the Polytechnic Institute of Technology, told Southern Weekend reporters that there are many concepts surrounding same-sex sexual behavior, but from a biological perspective, same-sex sexual behavior may be the same as homosexuality, bisexuality, etc. There are some similar mechanisms and evolutionary logic, which biologists can continue to study in the future. At the same time, psychologists can also delve into other aspects of this complex behavior, such as sexual preferences, to better understand the evolution of same-sex behavior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a historical perspective on same-sex sexual behavior, the key reason why evolutionary logic is difficult to understand lies in the inference that its adaptation costs are too high and the cost of behavior is too high. However, including the latest research, many studies in recent years have shown that same-sex sexual behavior does not mean &quot;no offspring&quot; in the evolutionary process, but may have a positive impact on the reproduction of offspring in other indirect ways. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, Brendan Zietsch, a scientist at the Center for Psychology and Evolution at the University of Queensland in Australia, used genetic data from hundreds of thousands of samples to simulate human evolution, which also included a large number of heterosexual Partner data. The analysis shows that among people who only have heterosexual sex, genetic genes related to same-sex sexual behavior can allow people to have more opposite-sex sexual partners at the same time, which means that they have gained a sexual mating advantage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Further analysis shows that this is also related to the personality traits of openness and risk-taking. People who are more open-minded will be more willing to try new things and have greater curiosity and imagination. Researchers speculate that genes related to same-sex behavior not only endow people with same-sex sexual tendencies, but also give people relevant personality traits, which gives people with relevant genetic genes an advantage in finding opposite-sex partners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thus, although same-sex sexual behavior itself does not produce offspring, related genes can give people the advantage of having offspring, resulting in same-sex sexual behavior being preserved to this day in the long evolution. However, Brendan Zic emphasized to Southern Weekend reporters that although this study has data advantages, the relevant explanations are still exploratory, and more research is needed to gain an in-depth understanding of the manifestations related to same-sex sexual behavior in order to understand the basis of its evolution. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Heritability in primates&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Professor Vincent Savolainen has also conducted research on same-sex sexual behavior and reached similar conclusions supporting reproductive advantages. . In August 2023, through the analysis of three years of detailed observation data of rhesus monkeys, they found that same-sex sexual behavior is very common in the rhesus monkey community and is basically not affected by factors such as age or community structure, and it does not bring any consequences to them. What fitness costs, conversely, same-sex sexual behavior regulates peer relationships and increases reproductive success. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relevant research was published in Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution, observing the social and sexual behavior of more than two hundred male rhesus monkeys. Combining ancestry data from decades ago, the study shows that same-sex behavior in male rhesus monkeys is both repeatable and heritable, with a heritability rate of 6.4%. This provides the first evidence of same-sex behavior in primates outside of humans. The first evidence that behavior is heritable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Rhesus macaques share more than 70% of their DNA with humans and have a common ancestor with us dating back about 25 million years. They are the main non-human primates used in biomedical research Animals are also excellent models for studying behavioral ecological issues such as same-sex sexual behavior. However, it is worth noting that there are still differences between rhesus monkeys and humans. Through research, we hope to unravel these intricate mysteries and discover the underlying Common behavior in our evolutionary history.&quot; Professor Vincent Savolainen explained to Southern Weekend reporters that the latest research shows that same-sex sexual behavior may be a common feature of primate reproductive ecology, which is important for understanding the behavior of human groups. Same-sex sexual behavior has certain enlightenment, but due to the influence of some unique social factors in human society, same-sex sexual behavior in human society does have a high cost. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Humans appear to be the only species that exhibits strict homosexuality.&quot; Professor Vincent Savolainen said cultural factors can influence this phenomenon. For example, in Samoa, some gay men, although they have no offspring, actually assume the role of women in society and help raise the children of relatives. &quot;I hope our research can play a role in fostering a more inclusive culture that embraces gender diversity, both in nature and in human society.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 18 Nov 2023 22:25:23 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[网购二手“人脉”真的靠谱吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260873]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-18 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https:// feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 18 Nov 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[不在职业资格目录中的“律师经纪人”，3860元拿证]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260871]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-18 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Lawyers and brokers&quot; have appeared in many lawsuits related to contract disputes.

(Photo provided by People’s Vision)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 14, 2023, a recommendation letter issued by the Liaoning Provincial Brokers Association was circulated in the legal community. The letter showed that the association recommended a &quot;lawyer broker&quot; to the Haicheng City People&#39;s Court as a litigation agent in a loan dispute case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the letters of recommendation were made public, many lawyers posted on social media to express concerns that lawyer brokers might corrupt the industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Lawyer broker&quot; is not the first time that &quot;lawyer broker&quot; has appeared. With this keyword, 27 civil and enforcement cases can be retrieved on the Judgment Document Network. Among them, 24 cases in which lawyers and brokers acted as litigation agents were heard by courts at all levels in Liaoning Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is certain that lawyer brokerage should be a job type &quot;created&quot; by the Liaoning Provincial Brokers Association. The association recommends others as litigation attorneys in the name of social groups. However, relevant legal persons pointed out that the operations of the Liaoning Provincial Brokers Association violated relevant legal regulations, and there are no occupations related to &quot;lawyer brokerage&quot; in the national professional qualification catalog. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After this matter was fermented in the legal community, the local lawyers association issued a reminder: Lawyers discovered the problem of &quot;lawyer agents&quot; and &quot;legal agents&quot; when performing their duties. You should raise objections to the case-handling agency where you are located, and do not participate in the operations of relevant companies or institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;For each case represented, 500 yuan is required to be paid to the association&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; &quot;>;In past cases, &quot;lawyer brokers&quot; mainly appeared in insurance disputes, contract disputes, and private lending disputes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In a motor vehicle traffic accident liability dispute ruled by the Yuhong District People&#39;s Court of Shenyang City in March 2023, Xiao drove a passenger car and rode an electric bicycle and ran a red light. Yang Mou collided, causing Yang to be injured. Yang then sued Xiao and the two insurance companies that Xiao insured, demanding various compensations totaling about 250,000 yuan. Both of Yang&#39;s litigation attorneys are &quot;lawyers and agents.&quot; In the end, the Shenyang Yuhong District Court ordered the insurance company to pay compensation of about 120,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In a contract dispute with the case number (2022) Liao 14 Min Zhong No. 1093, Yang and Liu signed a tableware factory transfer agreement, stipulating that Yang A certain person paid the transfer fee of RMB 170,000 in installments, but after the first payment period expired, Yang did not pay as agreed. Liu then sued Yang to perform the contract and pay liquidated damages, totaling about 200,000 yuan. Yang lost the case and appealed to the Huludao Intermediate People&#39;s Court, entrusting a &quot;lawyer agent&quot; to serve as his litigation agent. The Huludao Intermediate People&#39;s Court did not support Yang&#39;s appeal, and the second instance upheld the original verdict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The similarity between these cases is that the &quot;lawyers and brokers&quot; who represent the cases come from the same social organization: the Lawyers and Brokers Special Committee of the Liaoning Brokers Association. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The National Social Organization Credit Information Disclosure Platform shows that the Liaoning Provincial Broker Association was registered and established in 2007. Its supervisory unit is the Liaoning Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federation, and its business scope In order to guide the work of the brokerage industry in the province, organize broker business training and provide legal, policy, information consulting services, etc. to brokers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Special Committee for Lawyers and Brokers is a subsidiary organization of the Liaoning Provincial Broker Association. The association stated in the &quot;Instructions for the Liaoning Provincial Broker Qualification Certificate&quot; that, Possessing the Liaoning Provincial Broker Qualification Certificate can solve the problem of agency litigation qualification: you only need to pay 3,860 yuan once, and you can obtain the certificate after training and examination. &quot;You can pass the test without a legal basis.&quot; After that, you can act as an agent in civil litigation in Liaoning Province. cases, and engage in related activities such as appearing in court to respond to lawsuits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, those who have obtained the broker qualification certificate need to pay 500 yuan to the association to issue a recommendation letter for each case they represent. In addition, the broker&#39;s qualification certificate needs to be inspected every year, and the fee is 50 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Obviously different from citizen agents&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Lawyer broker The events have once again put citizen agency in the spotlight. However, attorney-broker representation cases initiated by the Liaoning Provincial Brokers Association are significantly different from normal citizen representation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Before the amendment of the Civil Procedure Law in 2012, the law allowed three categories of citizens to represent civil litigation cases: close relatives of the parties, relevant social groups or employees of the unit where they work. persons; other citizens entrusted by the parties concerned and approved by the People&#39;s Court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wu Zhiwei, deputy director of the Supreme People&#39;s Court Applied Law Research Base of Southwest University of Political Science and Law, said that the quality of citizen agency services is poor, fees are irregular, and it is easy to breed judicial rent-seeking, Regarding issues such as bribing judges, when the Civil Procedure Law was revised in 2012, &quot;other citizens permitted by the court&quot; were deleted, and the scope of citizens as entrusted litigation agents was limited to two categories: close relatives or staff of the parties; communities where the parties are located, Citizens recommended by units and relevant social groups. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Further requirements for community recommendation can be found in the interpretation of the Supreme People&#39;s Court on the application of the Civil Procedure Law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It stipulates that if relevant social groups recommend citizens to serve as litigation agents, the groups should be non-profit legal persons registered and established in accordance with the law. The principal shall be a member of a social group, or the domicile of one of the parties shall be in the area of ​​activity of the social group. In addition, the recommended person should also be the person in charge of the society or a staff member who has a labor relationship with the society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Compared with relevant regulations, Wu Zhiwei believes that strictly speaking, the behavior of the Liaoning Provincial Brokers Association violates the provisions of Article 87 of the Judicial Interpretation, &quot;These people do not Qualified to act as an agent in legal matters.&quot; The agency affairs must fall within the business scope specified in the articles of association of the social group. The business scope of the broker association is generally related to brokers. However, judging from the currently public judgment documents, the client in the case is not Brokers, &quot;If brokers have relevant civil disputes, they act as litigation agents, which is in compliance with the regulations.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another question is whether social groups can provide paid services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As early as 1993, the Ministry of Justice issued the &quot;Reply on Individual Citizens Not to Engage in Paid Legal Services Without Approval&quot; which explicitly required that citizen agents No remuneration can be collected. According to relevant regulations, travel expenses in citizen representation can be reimbursed by the parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But lawyers and brokers obviously charge fees. On November 14, 2023, the verdict of a contract dispute in Liaoning Province was circulated in the lawyer community: a lawyer and agent was sued by the client for failing to perform his obligation to appear in court in a previous divorce lawsuit, and requested the return of 5,000 yuan in legal services. fee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The &quot;Tips for Social Organizations to Carry out Legal Service Activities&quot; issued by the Social Organization Administration Bureau of the Liaoning Provincial Department of Civil Affairs on March 22, 2023 has mentioned that individual Social organizations illegally recommend citizens to act as agents in lawsuits and seek unfair economic benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This reminder sheet mentions that in accordance with relevant regulations, law-related social organizations strictly implement a management system with dual responsibilities between the registration management agency and the business supervisory unit. Social organizations shall carry out activities in accordance with the purposes and business scope stipulated in their articles of association and shall not engage in for-profit business activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Not in the National Vocational Qualification Catalog&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although Liaoning Province The Brokers Association has issued lawyer broker qualification certificates to many people, but the profession of &quot;lawyer broker&quot; is not included in the &quot;National Vocational Qualification Catalog&quot; announced by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security in 2021.

I have observed that the basic material living standards of American families, regardless of urban or rural areas, are not much different, so I pay more attention to showing their spiritual attributes. I spend a long time preparing for each photo, learning the characters’ stories in advance, visiting their rooms, thinking about the purpose of the shoot, and carefully selecting items for display. The choice of family covers both native Americans and immigrants who miss their hometown, as well as concepts about love, career, identity and gender, and the passage of time. The objects in each picture have been carefully arranged, using materials to reflect spiritual life. I moved these spiritual items in space and placed them in the same picture to visually enhance the common scenes. , highlighting the current living conditions, beliefs and emotional memories of this family or individual, and using a photo to outline a combination of reality and the spiritual world.

In March this year, Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong visited China, and China-Singapore relations were upgraded to a comprehensive, high-quality, forward-looking partnership. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taking the opportunity to take China-Singapore cooperation to a new level, Southern Weekend researchers interviewed Professor Liu Hong, Associate Vice President of Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. As an alumnus of Xiamen University and Fudan University, Liu Hong has studied and worked in many countries in Asia, North America, and Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Hong said that in the past ten years or so, he has noticed from his teaching, research and management work that the relationship between China and Singapore is showing several characteristics: all-round, advancing with the times and high quality. . From the early days of China learning from Singapore, it has now become a two-way trend of learning from each other and learning from each other. As China-Singapore relations enter a new stage of development, Nanyang Technological University is also constantly improving the level of cooperation projects to further promote the friendship and cooperation between Singapore and China in terms of depth and breadth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Liu Hong&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/cac4375609.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width =&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1544&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/cac4375609.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258735&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Photo by Liu Hong&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Lou Xiaoxi&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;When you go to China, seeing it once is better than hearing it a hundred times&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt; strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You have studied and worked in universities in many countries around the world, and you feel that Chinese students are similar to students from other countries. What are its characteristics? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Hong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The general characteristic of students in mainland China is that they are very diligent and studious. With more than 10 million college students graduating every year, competition is fierce. Among the college students from various countries I have come into contact with, Chinese students can be said to be leading in terms of diligence and studiousness. On the one hand, this is because the Chinese nation has a tradition of loving learning, but on the other hand, it is also because social competition is becoming increasingly fierce, so everyone must stand out. Employment for college students is a big challenge. Chinese students are very concerned about the development of the world situation and have a strong desire to study abroad. I personally studied in the Netherlands and the United States, and then worked in Singapore and the United Kingdom. I stayed at Kyoto University and Osaka University in Japan for almost two years, and I have many personal experiences. I think Chinese students are very diligent and studious. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you think are the differences between the Eastern and Western higher education systems? Same? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Hong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I have studied in the Netherlands for more than a year and in the United States for more than five years. Western countries have a tradition of pursuing knowledge. It does not take test scores as the main goal, but a more divergent and diverse goal. Students choose some subjects based on their own interests, so they can look at some issues from multiple perspectives. However, I think Western education has a major flaw - a lack of understanding of developing countries, including China. Recently, some scholars have analyzed that in international political economics textbooks and related papers in the 2010s, China only accounted for less than 11%, which is a very small proportion; but China is now the second largest economy in the world. , its total GDP is close to about 20% of the world&#39;s, which shows that there is a lack of knowledge about China in university textbooks. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How to let the West better understand China through education ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Hong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;During my tenure in the UK, I organized several times for hundreds of college students from different universities across the UK to go to China for two to three weeks. After Zhou’s study tour and immersion, I named this project “Experience a Dynamic China”. Many British people&#39;s understanding of China is very lacking and outdated, and most of it is what they read in books. We organize them to travel to different cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Jinan, and to different places (including rural areas), allowing them to experience a constantly changing and developing China. I think that in international education and exchanges, we can have more Chinese stories and more Chinese voices. One of the sources is to let foreigners experience it for themselves. The feedback I received from the participants of these immersion activities is that after many people returned home, they said that their impressions of China had almost undergone earth-shaking changes, and that seeing a hundred times was worse than seeing it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Scientific research achievements are implemented in the Greater Bay Area&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;How does Nanyang Technological University promote cooperation in education between China and Singapore in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Hong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The Greater Bay Area is now a region with the greatest development potential in China. Singapore and China have cooperated to establish the Sino-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City. Our university has jointly established the Sino-Singapore International Joint Research Institute with the Knowledge City and South China University of Technology, and the progress is very good. In addition to integrating industry, academia and research, the Knowledge City also arranged for some government officials to come to us for training. I am currently leading a research project on business environment improvement and enhancement commissioned by Guangzhou Development Zone and China-Singapore Knowledge City. We hope that when talking about China&#39;s development, we do not just talk about it on paper, but we have an understanding of China&#39;s latest development, and then connect China&#39;s development with the development of the world. In this process, what useful experiences can Singapore provide? How can we make progress together? In fact, the purpose of our project is to promote friendly relations between Singapore and China, and ASEAN and China. This big goal is the direction that my colleagues and I work together. This is also the main goal of the new president of Nanyang Technological University, Professor Ho Tak Wa, who recently proposed to create a &quot;Nanyang Technological University Singapore-China Knowledge Hub&quot;. Both the Singaporean government and Nanyang Technological University are paying great attention to and attaching great importance to the development of the Greater Bay Area. For example, the Sino-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City I just mentioned has become a national-level project between China and Singapore, relying on and benefiting from it. Against the background of the rapid development of the Greater Bay Area. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;As the Associate Vice-President of Nanyang Technological University, I have a lot of thoughts on the future What are the plans for cooperation? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Hong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Whether it is in Guangzhou, Hong Kong, or Shenzhen, we have a lot of cooperation now and in the future. These cooperations not only focus on In cultivating talents, we also pay special attention to the integration of industry, academia and research. The relationship between New Zealand and China is more about learning from each other and advancing with the times. Our main purpose is to transform the latest scientific research results from around the world, especially Singapore, into the fertile soil of the Greater Bay Area, make them take root, sprout and promote them. This is why we set up an international joint research institute in Guangzhou, and why our cooperation with Shenzhen focuses on innovation. Singapore and Shenzhen focus on cooperating to build a series of new developments such as smart cities and digital economy. Shenzhen leads not only China but also the world in innovation. We have been cooperating a lot with universities in the Greater Bay Area. Student exchanges and scientific research cooperation with universities in Hong Kong will also be further deepened. In the future, our Nanyang Graduate School of Public Administration may further increase talent training in places such as Guangzhou and Shenzhen. Shenzhen is paying more and more attention to ASEAN. Of course, ASEAN can also use the platform of Shenzhen or Guangdong to further develop. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the field of public governance, Singapore and China have What experiences can be learned from each other? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Hong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Our research pays special attention to public governance in Asia. Now, some theories, experiences and models of global public governance are mainly based on Western experience. We hope to explore the experiences of these countries through in-depth analysis of the development of Singapore, China, and other ASEAN countries, and analyze how they contribute to global public governance theory and practice. We have many research projects, including focusing on the &quot;One Belt and One Road&quot; as a new model of cross-border governance, focusing on mutual learning and reference between Asian and African countries, and also including the &quot;Belt and Road&quot; context, Chinese enterprises &quot; Going global&quot; and different models of cooperation with other countries are several research focuses of myself and our school. We hope to continue to maintain close contact with the Chinese government, state-owned enterprises or universities in the future. As China-Singapore relations enter a new stage of development, we are constantly improving the level of projects and further promoting the friendly cooperation between Singapore and China in terms of depth and breadth. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Essence of Civilized Dialogue&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot; >;What do you think of the “One Belt, One Road” initiative? What are the key directions for future development? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Hong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This year marks the 10th anniversary of the “Belt and Road” initiative, which is a very important development milestone. In the past few months, I have been invited to give no fewer than 10 speeches on the Belt and Road Initiative. It can be seen that different countries in the world are very concerned about the &quot;One Belt, One Road&quot; initiative, although their starting points are different. The &quot;five links&quot; in the &quot;Belt and Road&quot; initiative include people-to-people connectivity and policy communication, which are two aspects that our college and I are very concerned about. I regard the people-to-people bonds and policy communication in the &quot;five links&quot; as a piece of software; infrastructure construction, trade, and investment are hardware. Only when hardware and software are organically combined can they play their best roles. For future development, on the one hand, we must think about how to further improve the quality and influence of the “One Belt, One Road” project based on the achievements made in the past 10 years, including focusing on a series of topics such as digital economy, green development, and public health. It will become the focus of the future development of “One Belt, One Road”. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Now the young generation is &quot;going out&quot; in Chinese culture What role can it play? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Hong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Chinese culture &quot;going out&quot; to engage in civilized dialogue requires us to further develop it. In this process, young people from China, as well as Chinese state-owned enterprises, Chinese scientific researchers, university teachers, etc., all played important roles. I think that in terms of future development, it is very important to grasp the essence of Chinese cultural development, including some characteristics of Chinese cultural traditions: being upright but not old-fashioned, respecting the past but not retrospecting. First of all, you must understand your own culture, have your own cultural roots, and then start a dialogue with other cultures. Secondly, we still need to treat other cultures with an attitude of equality, tolerance, openness and respect. In terms of culture, every country&#39;s culture has its own characteristics and advantages, which are the product of different countries&#39; own environments. We should adopt an attitude of understanding and respect and cannot say that China does this, why don&#39;t you this way? Only by understanding and communicating can we truly &quot;go global&quot; with our culture. Third, we must still pay attention to innovation. Whether it is Chinese culture or the culture of other countries, it must reflect the development characteristics of the new era, including the fourth industrial revolution we are now in, an era of parallel globalization and anti-globalization. , global geopolitics has also undergone many changes. Under such circumstances, we should look at creative transformations of Chinese culture and world culture to achieve more effective dialogue. The &quot;Global Development Initiative&quot; and &quot;Global Civilization Initiative&quot; proposed by the Chinese government have provided Chinese wisdom for the development of the world. Chinese wisdom has very profound connotations, but in terms of communication and exchange methods, we still have more room for efforts to let countries around the world understand the essence of Chinese culture. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 18 Nov 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一中学发生拥挤踩踏事件：改善硬件设施与提高管理水平当双管齐下丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260863]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-18 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A campus accident involving casualties touched people&#39;s hearts. On November 14, 2023, the People&#39;s Government of Wuzhi County, Henan Province reported a casualty incident in a local middle school: At about 10 a.m. on November 13, some boys in the first and second grades of Xinghua Middle School in Wuzhi County went to the toilet between midterm exams. At that time, he fell and was injured due to crowding going up and down the stairs. The students involved were immediately sent to the hospital for examination and treatment. Currently, one student died after all-out efforts to rescue him failed, one seriously injured student is being treated with all-out efforts, and four students with minor injuries are hospitalized for observation and treatment and will be discharged in the near future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Beijing News&quot; report, the details of the incident revealed by insiders are: &quot;The toilets in Xinghua Middle School are on two floors. The men&#39;s toilets have to be climbed up by stairs. The stair railings are all intact. I don&#39;t know. Why did a stampede happen?&quot; According to pictures of the school posted online, there were no toilets in the teaching building of the school where the incident occurred. Students had to go down to the teaching building first and then take the stairs upstairs to use the toilet. The tragedy also happened while going up and down the stairs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the accident, many schools across the country required teachers on duty to be arranged on each floor during class breaks. Some media have called for more &quot;break time&quot; or &quot;examination time&quot; to allow students more time to go to the toilet. Some netizens believe that schools should improve hardware facilities and install toilets on every floor of the teaching building. In addition to these obvious problems, this accident is still worthy of analysis in terms of responsibility distribution and preventive measures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first is the nature of the accident. Media reports all reported the accident as a &quot;stampede&quot;, but the wording in the report was &quot;crowding and falling.&quot; So, what was the nature of the accident? This deserves further investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If what &quot;informed people&quot; said about &quot;the stair railings are intact&quot; and what netizens revealed about &quot;the toilets are in another building&quot; are true, then the accident may have occurred during the ten minutes between exams. Students first went down to the teaching building and then to the &quot;toilet building&quot; next door. The high-density flow of people caused congestion and falls while going up and down the stairs, which ultimately led to the tragedy of one death and five injuries. The students who died unfortunately should have died from one of the following possibilities: first, suffocation caused by high-density crowds; second, falling from a high place due to gravity; third, being trampled after falling due to crowding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second issue is the cause of the accident and the attribution of responsibility. After the accident, insufficient number of toilets and insufficient time between exams were two major objective causes identified by netizens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A midterm exam usually takes about two hours, at least three times the length of a normal class, which will greatly increase the frequency of bathroom breaks. Candidates need to go to the toilet to relax between exams, which will undoubtedly further increase the frequency of going to the toilet. If you add in the factors of greater psychological pressure on candidates and more hurry and panic when going to and from the toilet, the superposition of multiple variables is enough to amplify the safety risk: the common two-hour exam time, the same nervousness, which increases the group resonance The probability of occurrence also increases the probability of accidents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The school’s hardware facilities could not be changed on the day of the incident, and the exam time and exam time had also been determined. Then, I am afraid that the only thing the invigilator could do that day was to prevent the students from going out to use the toilet, so as to 100% eliminate any possibility of this accident. What should be asked is, who made these rules? Who is responsible for such poor hardware facilities? This is the person who should be held responsible, not the invigilator who was just enforcing the rules on the day of the incident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Again, how to prevent similar accidents from happening again? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not the first time that similar accidents have occurred in China. In the stampede at the No. 3 Experimental Primary School in Puyang, Henan in March 2017, students &quot;rushed down like a flood&quot; after finishing morning reading; and in the stampede at a middle school in Xuchang, Henan in November 2000, students were studying in the evening Something happened after class. Similar accidents have occurred many times across the country. The causes of these accidents are similar: the recess time is short, or the class duration is too long. As soon as the bell rings, students rush to the toilet or go out, causing stampedes due to congestion. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, only by controlling variables and prescribing the right medicine can we find a solution to prevent such accidents. It is certainly necessary for schools to install toilets in strict accordance with the &quot;Design Code for Primary and Secondary Schools&quot;. Installing diversion barriers at densely populated entrances and exits of schools is also a way. During large-scale activities such as exams, sports games, and school celebrations, it is also indispensable for the school to arrange dedicated personnel to ensure the order of the flow of people and implement staggered peak management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to upgrading hardware facilities, schools should also focus on improving software, that is, management levels. Specific to this incident, we should also ask whether the school arranged for off-peak exams that day, and whether there was a dedicated person responsible for maintaining order in the flow of people? To be more specific, did the school allow candidates to use the toilet when the exam was in progress on the day of the incident? This will also ease the stress of going to the bathroom between exams. Also, does the school provide safety education on preventing crowding and stampeding, and does it conduct corresponding safety drills? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No matter how good the hardware facilities are, they have an approved capacity, and their redundancy has a limit. You cannot expect that everything will be fine by building more toilets, expanding the volume of the teaching building, and installing diversion barriers. Otherwise, those facilities There will be no stampede accidents in large-scale tourist attractions that are well-established. Long-term scientific management is the best guarantee to prevent problems before they occur, and its importance is by no means inferior to improving hardware facilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, schools cannot lock students in classrooms because of such incidents, and cannot make the temporary arrangement of &quot;arranging on-duty teachers on each floor between classes&quot; permanent, as this may increase the number of students. It has reduced the non-teaching burden of teachers and led to the misunderstanding that &quot;schools should have unlimited safety responsibilities for students&quot;. To improve school management, schools can also think about delegating more power and giving students more freedom out of classrooms, teaching buildings and playgrounds, so that students can practice their ability to deal with risks and learn to protect themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 18 Nov 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[为什么有的人睡觉打着呼噜就“嘎”了？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260615]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-18 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Recently, Olympic gymnastics champion Yang Wei revealed that he has respiratory problems , attracted everyone&#39;s attention.

This setting is mainly to make the entire story logic smoothly, &lt;span>; constitutes a closed loop of causality. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; But whether it is the emotion based on the character or the audience&#39;s emotions, this setting is unacceptable, and there is a sense of power that forcibly self -tell. To apply the netizens, this move is tantamount to &quot;Harry Potter manipulated the Voldemort to kill his parents in the past&quot;, &quot;Batman buying a thief back to kill his parents&quot;, &quot;Iron Man instructed the Winter soldiers back and killed &quot;My parents&quot;. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; In the animated version, this &quot;mother -in -law&quot; plot has been taken by a stroke, which is extremely vague. Because of this, it did not cause controversy like the comic version, but just made Allen a little tragedy. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/fb44a83ea8765F7FA.PNG&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; style = &quot; OPACITY: 1; &quot;Width =&quot; 692 &quot;Height =&quot; 389 &quot;Data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/fb44a8765AFCBE894DA7E5F7FA. png &quot;data-key =&quot; 258722 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>;&quot; Attack on the Giant &quot;is known as &lt;/span>; God&#39;s masterpiece is because it reflects reality and depicts a conflict of imaginary world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The story begins with a giant invasion on Paradi. Human beings were unable to resist the giants, so three high walls (Hina, Rosse, Mary) were established to resist the giants in exchange for a hundred years of peace. But the terrible giant came, &quot;On that day, humans finally remembered the fear of being dominated by the giant, and the humiliation trapped in the bird cage &lt;span>;.&quot; &lt;/Span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; Allen and his friends Samada and Almin, suffered a heavy blow in the invasion of the giant, and finally admitted to the investigation team to fight the giant together. At first, the growth line of Allen and others followed the traditional hot routine. However, with the continuous advancement of the plot, the audience quickly discovered its abnormalities -it was not subject to the dual confrontation of good and evil, but instead digging the complexity of human nature. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; The reversal of the plot drives the audience and the protagonist to continue thinking, breaking, rebuilding, and breaking their thinking. Ellen fought a line during the battle, but he did not expect to force his giant power. In the investigation of the Corps, many giants were also hidden, and three comrades -in -arms who were born with Allen not only had the power of giants, but also &quot;spy.&quot; I thought the giants were all non -human monsters. I did not expect giants to be humans. The giants were suffering from war and were victims of race opponents. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/f946227cb4cb52357034e66a9.png&quot; 0 &quot;style&quot; style = &quot; OPACITY: 1; &quot;Width =&quot; 693 &quot;Height =&quot; 383 &quot;Data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/f9462227cb52357034e66a9. png &quot;data-key =&quot; 258724 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; All &lt;/span>; humans who can become giants are Edians. They are regarded as&quot; descendants of devil &quot;by ordinary people. Two thousand years ago, the Eldians who won the power of the giant from the ancestor Yomil were called a king in the world. One hundred years ago, the Edians were defeated by the Malays. The royal family led some people to cross the sea to Parady Island and lived a isolated life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The Edians who stayed in other countries became slaves and lived a concentrated camp. For thousands of years, ordinary people have a deep hostility for the Edians, and have always wanted to remove it quickly. This hostile made Allen go to &quot;blackened&quot;. He decided to borrow the land to launch the &quot;destroyed plan&quot; -hundreds of thousands of 60 -meter -high &lt;span>; giant giants runaway on the ground, which is indiscriminately, without differences, without differences, without differences, without differences, without differences, without differences, without differences, without differences, without differences, without differences, there is no difference. Traveling on all life and massacre 80%of humans outside Paradi. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; The next part of the part is the &quot;Final War&quot; after the launch of the ground. At the end, under the cover of other members, Misaki found Allen&#39;s true body, then cut off Allen&#39;s skull, and gave him a affectionate kiss. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/d6f869a729a1ad946452176faf14.jpeg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; style = &quot; opacity: 1; &quot;width =&quot; 1080 &quot;height =&quot; 607 &quot;data-src =&quot; // images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/d6f869a729452176faf14. jpeg &quot;data-key =&quot; 258719 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; On the surface,&quot; Attack on the Giant &quot;&lt;/span>; tells the story of&quot; Dragon Dragon Slaying Boys into the Dragon &quot;. Simple, related to sacrifice, more related to saving. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Allen&#39;s death is destined. As early as the awarding ceremony, he had predicted the future. He repeatedly tried to change his destiny, but all ended in failure. In order to break the reincarnation, let the power of the giant completely disappear, and let the Eldian people be treated equally or even admired, he can only embark on an extremely lonely path. He mobilized the ground, opened the Holocaust, and then made his companions a hero, intending to use his own sacrifice in exchange for the peace of the Edians, as he said, &quot;This is to save Paradish Island The only way to go to everyone &quot;. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; Allen&#39;s actions are another sense of fighting. He was weighed between saving and sacrifice, and finally chose to sacrifice the world to save people around him. This decision made him transform from a hero to a demon. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/ADCD3B5F37CD9df0370529A58D.PNG&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; style &quot;style = &quot; opacity: 1; &quot;width =&quot; 692 &quot;&quot; height = &quot;390&quot; data-src = &quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/18/adcd3b5f3703705529a58d. png &quot;data-key =&quot; 258725 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; In addition to digging the complex human nature, &lt;/span>;&quot; Attack on the Giant &quot;also involves many profound propositions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For example, freedom. Allen has been pursuing freedom. Since childhood, he has been curious about the sea outside the wall and the other side of the sea, and feels that it is the ideal world of freedom. But in the end, he found that &quot;the other side of the sea is an enemy.&quot; The so -called freedom, especially absolute freedom, does not exist at all. As a result, Allen finally became a free slave until his death made him relieved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Another example is the discussion of the significance of survival. In the second part of the end, Almin and Gick started a philosophical dialogue. Gick is a typical pessimist. He believes that the fate of human beings is to carry out an endless and painful reincarnation. The purpose of life is to reproduce, meaningless. And Almin believes that the significance of life is in a hurry, lies in the feelings of living at the moment: pick up shells by the seaside, run with partners, read books at home, watch pine and eat tree fruit ... These seem to be casual and casual ... These seem to be free to eat and eat… These seemingly casual casual ... These seem to be casual and casual ... These seem to be free to eat and eat ... These seem to be free to eat and eat. These seem to be casual. These seem to be casual. The sporadic fragments constitute the Chinese chapter in human life. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; These propositions all give the &quot;Attack on the Giant&quot; that has the depth that ordinary blood is not. Therefore, in a sense, in the past ten years, the audience has watched the growth of Allen and others, and parted ways. At the same time, as the personal mind matures, it has more perception and understanding of this work. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; The splitting and war caused by problems such as the rich and the poor, race, ideology and other issues of the human world are always circulating and endless. Just like the current -Israeli conflict, they always seem to verify the metaphor included in &quot;Attack on the Attack&quot; again and again. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; At the end of the story, Misaki buried Allen under the tree he liked the most. In the future, even if the giant&#39;s power is lost, the war of human beings has never stopped. At this point, a man found the tree buried Allen. He walked in, just like the ancestor Yumil, ancestors of thousands of years ago, is about to gain the power of giants ... &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; This seems to be telling us that as long as human destiny The tragedy will not be completely ended. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/daf3712a921d7eb60a4ae6f372410.png&quot; 0 &quot;style =&quot; 0 &quot;style = &quot; opacity: 1; &quot;width =&quot; 692 &quot;&quot; height = &quot;390&quot; data-src = &quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/18/daf3712a921d7eb60ae6f372410. png &quot;data-key =&quot; 258726 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; In this case, is the world of constant conflicts still worthy of our efforts, struggle and life? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; This returns to the conversation between Gick and Almin. They are like the two sides of Yushanchuang, on the one hand to reveal the nature of the world, and point out the cruelty of the world; on the one hand, we give us warmth, hope and strength, let us cherish our precious moments, and live our own life. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Perhaps, in the final analysis, everything is just a choice. Will you choose to be Gick or Almin? Or, do you still have other choices? Anyway, how to survive the world, everything depends only on yourself. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 18 Nov 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[当WeWork不再work]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260848]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-18 14:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/23/23/ 11/18/jgrhwurucpqduncfyatydzirewuctBoqitgd.jpg &quot;border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 960 &quot;height =&quot; 640 &quot;data-src =&quot; // images.infzm.com/medias/ima/ima GE/23/11/18/JGRHWURUCPQDUNCFYATYDZIREWUCTBOQITGQN4GD. jpg &quot;data-key =&quot; 258717 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999; text-align: center; &quot;>; August 19, 2023, Beijing, WeWork jointly shared office space &lt;span style = &quot;COLOR: #AAA;&quot;>; (Visual China/Picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the early morning of October 12, Huang Wei on the way to work suddenly received a notice from the front desk group -office area will start now Stop water supply. Soon after he arrived in the company, he was told that the WeWork joint office area located in Shanghai World Trade Building was unable to continue its operation, and tenants needed to move to other properties under WeWork as soon as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Huang Wei&#39;s startup team just settled in September 2023. The rent is lower than his expected, and the monthly quotation of a single station is 1,200 yuan. When he returned to China at the end of 2019, he learned about the market. A WeWork near the Suzhou River, the same configuration station price was about 2,000 yuan. Sales tell him that if the high vacancy rate affects the operation, this price cannot be signed in this area. At that time, in this wework, the office area below 5 was still saturated, and more than 10 offices were vacant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The reminder of the front desk &quot;first come first&quot; cannot be hesitant. Huang Wei quickly selected a office space for Wework to be located one kilometers away. When he saw the news of &quot;WeWork&#39;s application for bankruptcy protection&quot;, he had moved into the WeWORK office area in Shanghai Square for half a month. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On November 6, local time, in order to get rid of huge liabilities, WeWork applied for bankruptcy protection in New Jersey, USA. However, the bankruptcy application is limited to the office of Wework in the United States and Canada. The next day, WeWork China issued a statement saying that WeWork China was separated from WeWork at the end of 2020. As an independent brand, it has independent management and management capabilities. . &quot;&amp; Nbsp; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; WeWork, founded in New York, USA, is known as&quot; shared the originator of the office. &quot; WeWork will lease commercial buildings at a preferential price for a long time. After redesigning and renovation, it will be divided into shared office space, providing elastic lease contracts for freelancers, startups and large enterprises, and earning rental differences and additional service fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2010, the negative impact of the US financial crisis was still continuing. Commercial buildings were widely idle due to the tide of corporate failure. At that time, WeWork, who was born in the sky, not only decorated with fashion, but also provided flexible lease options, but also provided free coffee drinks to host a wealth of community activities ... WeWork co -founder Adam Noonman advocated &quot;space is service&quot;, claiming To create a &quot;physical social network&quot;, a &quot;make people live without just a living world.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/udrbk6sd0u9lpcrqvn5yv3jgatyqoxh1r.jpg =&quot; 0 &quot;width = &quot;960&quot; height = &quot;633&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/udrbk6sd0u9lpcrqvn5yv3jgatyqoxhjpg&quot; data-key = &quot;258715&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>; On November 6, 2019, Tokyo, Japan, Sun Zhengyi, chairman and president of SoftBank Group, attended the press conference. SoftBank said that its investment value in WeWork has decreased by nearly $ 4.6 billion &lt;span style = &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (visual China/picture) Interest rates have been at a low level for a long time, and capital is eager to enter the private equity market for higher benefits. In the era when the concept of sharing economy was highly supported, WeWork became the darling of capital, and it ranked among the unicorn in just four years. In 2019, under the &quot;escort&quot; of large shareholders SoftBank, WeWork&#39;s valuation soared to an amazing $ 47 billion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At that time, Sun Zhengyi, CEO of SoftBank Group, called WeWork &quot;the next Alibaba.&quot; Alibaba is the most successful investment case of this &quot;unicorn hunter&quot;. In 2000, SoftBank injected $ 20 million in Alibaba, which was established in just one year. Fourteen years later, Alibaba was listed, and the value of shares held by SoftBank was about 2900 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; SoftBank was once an investment vane of the sharing economy track. Sun Zhengyi advocated injecting a large amount of capital into the start -up company to help him quickly crush competitors in scale and become the leading brand in the market. With a view to gaining the absolute advantages of users and the market, long -term profitability is achieved. Uber and Didi are investment cases of SoftBank&#39;s sharing economy in the same period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, after half a year of valuation, WeWork was planted into a long and steep falling stage. In August 2019, with the exposure of the first public offering (IPO) application, WeWork&#39;s continuous losses caused the market&#39;s concerns about the company&#39;s profitability. Nonotan&#39;s financial and leadership issues have been exposed one after another. In the same month, after half a year after the listing, Uber appeared in the biggest loss since the issuance of its financial report. For a while, the discussion of the unicorn bubble was very enthusiastic. WeWork&#39;s listing plan was put on hold indefinitely. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Since then, Noman has resigned from the CEO position, and the new management has been introduced to help the restructuring company&#39;s leasing business. It was not until October 2021 that WeWork finally went public with a valuation of $ 9 billion. But listing is not a elixir, but it has become a magnifying glass for continuous exposure. Although WeWork has always claimed to be a technology company, it has always been unable to rely on its own profit to achieve non -linear growth, and the business model has not separated from the scope of commercial real estate leasing that heavily assets. The main body of WeWork is small and entrepreneurial institutions, with weak anti -risk capabilities and greater liquidity. As the industry competition is becoming increasingly fierce, to retain this part of customers who are extremely sensitive to costs, WeWork has to face the problem of low prices and rising costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The new crown epidemic in 2020 was outbreak in the world, and home office has become a common trend. Economic recession has led to a large number of customers closed the door. The vacancy rate of the office has risen sharply. WeWork, as the &quot;second landlord&quot;, still needs to pay the landlord for rent. WeWork, who rose in the last round of crisis, became the victim of a new round of crisis. The time limit mismatch may bring generous profits in the economic prosperity period, and it is heavy negative in the economic downturn, and several rounds of interest rate hikes since the Federal Reserve&#39;s epidemic have exacerbated WeWork&#39;s debt burden. The long -standing systemic risk ushered in a concentrated explosion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/gjloin0n5fg6lpe2jsj5yWDTUDRFEU0WMNJF7H.jpg&quot; 0 &quot;width = &quot;960&quot; height = &quot;641&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/gjloin0n5fg6lpe2jsj5ywdtudrfdfeu0mnjf7h.jpg&quot; data-key = &quot;258716&quot;>; &lt;/p. >; &lt;p style = &quot;coloror : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>; On April 12, 2018, Wework co-founder Norotan visited Shanghai &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; (Visual China/Picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In August 2023, WeWork pointed out in the second quarter financial report that considering losses and expected cash demand, coupled with the increase in membership loss and the current level of liquidity, whether the company can continue to operate depends on management depends on management Whether the layer can improve liquidity and profitability in the next 12 months. As of June 30, the company still had $ 2.9 billion in long -term debt and long -term leased debt of $ 13.3 billion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; WeWork CEO David Tori believes that due to the lack of &quot;the necessary financial flexibility to adapt to the fast -changing commercial real estate market&quot;, it is necessary to reorganize the &quot;unsustainable lease&quot;. Applying for bankruptcy protection is the attempt to survive adversity. WeWork is seeking the court&#39;s approval of its termination of 69 leases that can not be operated, and negotiate with more than 400 landlords to revise the existing lease. Analysis generally believes that the exit of WeWork will cause the vacancy rate of office buildings that have already risen to rise further, which will have a negative impact on the cash flow and value of the office building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It seems like a cycle. When the market enthusiastically discusses the butterfly effect caused by the Wework storm, competitors are more willing to regard WeWork&#39;s &quot;big defeat&quot; as &quot;episode&quot;, or even opportunities for industry changes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The biggest irony of WeWork&#39;s bankruptcy is that it happened at a record of the industry&#39;s performance.&quot; &quot;In the interview, a metaphor,&quot; When the Marriott Hotel is not operating well, it will become Hyatt Hotel. &quot;Mark Dixon, CEO of IWG Group, who is also a shared office operator, introduced in an interview with the BBC. IWG has now acquired and re -launched office space that once belonged to WeWork. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The lessons of the front car of WeWork, from the &quot;direct lease&quot; heavy asset model to the &quot;division&quot; light asset model, is the direction of the industry&#39;s general efforts in recent years, and it is even more imminent. However, whether the owner is willing to accept this adjustment still depends on their comprehensive assessment of the economic environment and operating value. A recent report released by iWG shows that 200 of the 204 new office venues signed in the third quarter of 2023 belonged to light asset operations, but from the perspective of the body, 60 % of the operating in traditional leasing methods still accounted for 60 % . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the Chinese market, WeWork China also hopes to become a traffic entrance in the stock era. &quot;It is very bitter to rely on the business model of the difference in rent, but this is also our core competitiveness and advantage.&quot; &amp; Nbsp; WeWork Vice President Quan Bin said in an interview with &quot;New Media&quot; recently that enterprises must live It must be better and longer, and must be done faster and more resolute in terms of cost reduction and efficiency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/axaj158qlvgksfl7LPYGSCN5DIYBK8RSJPG&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; widt h = &quot;960&quot; height = &quot;720&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/axaj158qlvgksfl7LPYGSCN5Diybk8rsjrtmaet.jpg&quot; data- &quot;&lt;258718&quot;>; &lt;/>; &lt;/ p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color : #999; text-align: center; &quot;>; Shanghai, wework jointly shared office space &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; (visual China/picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is said that the decline in rental costs is a good thing, but it also reflects the downturn in the real estate industry. Huang Wei&#39;s entrepreneurial project is doing architectural design, and business is closely related to the rise and fall of the industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At the end of 2019, Huang Wei returned from the Netherlands and successively worked in a European and American architectural design company and a local design studio. &quot;Party A is not very good, and it is even more difficult to do design services downstream. The amount of projects that can be received seriously shrinks, and the industry is serious. If you survive, you must sink or shrink. The price -performance ratio is also very low. Many of my classmates and friends have switched to career. &quot;In early 2022, Huang Wei and two other partners co -founded Miaqi Design Studio. Faced with uncertainty and threshold of 30 years of age, Huang Wei still persisted in trying again in the industry he loved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For more than a year, he has been sharing his entrepreneurial realization in social media. The small office relocation storm was also edited into a short video by him. At the end of the video, he talked about his views on this &quot;uncertain age&quot;. Unexpectedly, this became one of his most popular videos in the near future. Private messages poured in like snowflakes. Many messages talk about their feelings for such sudden changes. Of course, &quot;advertising&quot; more and selling his office venue to him. According to Shibang Wei Lishi, the addition of new supply in Shanghai in the second half of 2023 is expected to exceed 950,000 square meters, which is the highest level in the past ten years. Weak demand and supply volume, the office market is still in a slow recovery period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Huang Wei quickly passed the message board. Compared with the pressure of continuous operation, the office&#39;s sudden shutdown seems worthless. His lease was signed in September 2024. In 2023, the competition in the industry is far away. Last year, at the bidding meeting, the masters -level office fought in the end. How about next year? He is still &quot;expected.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 18 Nov 2023 14:25:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[梁静茹演唱会“柱子票”案开庭：主办方是否应提前告知成焦点]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260853]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-18 13:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; In May this year, many audiences reported that they bought &quot;pillar tickets&quot; at Liang Jingru Shanghai Concert and vision.

If we still cannot accept the plan they propose, we will wait for the court to judge.&quot; Of the nine audiences who filed a lawsuit this time, six were the audience on May 20th, and the three of them were on May 21st audiences. The price of the tickets for the purchase of the ticket included 1299 yuan, 999 yuan, and so on. &quot;We submitted the case to the court in early August to apply for a case, and received the news of the court filed by the court at the end of August. Everyone met through social media, because the negotiation with the organizer failed in the early stage, and we were forced to choose to prosecute. It is necessary to figure out whether the host violates our legitimate rights and interests. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Ms. Li said that she purchased two two -layer entrance tickets worth 1299 yuan on May 20, and the upper seat rate on the day was quite high. The photo shows that Ms. Li&#39;s vision is a hollowed column in the middle, and singers can be seen vaguely. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Nandu reporters search for the seat distribution map found that the two diagonal formation formed by the four corners basically occurred in the column, but the page was not marked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is understood that the organizer Shanghai Rubik&#39;s Cube Pan Cultural Performing Arts Co., Ltd. has responded that it is only responsible for the landing of Liang Jingru&#39;s Shanghai concert. The stage cannot be built on the stage. During the ticket sales stage, the company did not know that there were four pillars on the stage design. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Ms. Li told Nandu reporters that the organizer had stated that within the scope of her recognition, a 200 yuan shopping card was sent as the gold. . &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; &lt;strong>; The focus of the dispute is in advance whether the organizer should inform &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; On November 15th, in the trial of the case, the two parties revolved around the &quot;whether the organizer should should whether the organizer should should should Inform the existence of the &quot;Pillar Ticket&quot; in advance and whether these positions affect the concert experience &quot;and other controversial focus, and conducted court investigations and debate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Ms. Li introduced to Nandu reporters that there are three main aspects of the requests of the 9 plaintiff -the request to order the defendant to return the plaintiff&#39;s concert ticket money; Take the cost of litigation in this case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The plaintiff&#39;s agent said that the focus of the case was whether the defendant informed all the plaintiffs in advance whether their sight would be blocked. The purpose of the plaintiff to watch the concert was to &quot;watch&quot;, and the vision was blocked is a very serious breach of contract. The plaintiff&#39;s right to informed infringement caused the loss of choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The defendant&#39;s agent stated that the load -bearing column was adopted because the ceiling of the venue was insufficient. Without the load -bearing column of the ground, the performance could not be held normally. The pillar is also a regular practice in the industry. &quot;Some positions of the audience will inevitably have a problem of observation of sight. This is common sense. The defendant never deliberately mentioned in the propaganda that there was no pillar and no obstruction.&quot; It should be completed earlier. Before the concert begins, the organizer should also fulfill the corresponding responsibilities to inform the consumers who will be blocked and ask if they want to refund or give other plans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The defendant&#39;s agent said that the defendant mainly set up a pillar based on security considerations. details. The response method of other subsequent performances was improved after being influenced by this performance. The processing plan of the renewal of the game in the future must be required to ask for the first stop; It is the intention of fraud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At about 3 pm on the 15th, the trial of the case was over, and the court was not sentenced. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; &lt;strong>; The China Consumers Association once named the phenomenon of &quot;pillars ticket&quot; &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; For &quot;pillar tickets&quot;, the concert organizer&#39;s handling method is different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Nandu previously reported that on August 14 this year, Jay Chou&#39;s 2023 Carnival World Tour Hohhot Station organizer, Shanxi Xingtai Guangying Culture and Entertainment Co., Ltd. Fans can experience the joyful atmosphere of the concert on the spot and reduce the congestion outside the concert venue. The organizers will coordinate and fight for the seats with poor vision due to the audio console with poor vision with the audio console. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At the same time, the organizer stated in the announcement that the seating view of this area was affected by the audio console, and there were different degrees of obstruction. Watch, the special tickets will not be refunded after purchasing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On August 2nd, the China Consumers Association named the phenomenon of various types of &quot;pillar tickets&quot; and &quot;wall roots&quot; phenomenon, pointing out that consumers encountered &quot;blind selection&quot; seats at online shopping performance tickets. When I bought the tickets, I chose the seat. I learned that I bought the &quot;pillar ticket&quot; and &quot;wall root ticket&quot; of the blind spot of vision, which caused the ticket problem &quot;only smells the sound&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; China Consumers said that the relevant performance ticketing platform and the organizer should stand on the perspective of promoting the release of consumption potential, thinking about how to better protect consumer rights and increase consumer experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 18 Nov 2023 13:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[首位博士说 | 陈云生：宪法监督的研究任务依然任重道远]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260736]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-18 12:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Dr. File: &lt;/strong>; &lt;/p >; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, simkai, stkaiti;&quot;>; Chen Yunsheng, the first constitutional PhD in Constitution in New China. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, simkai, stkaiti;&quot;>; 1942, born in Pinggu County, Beijing (now Pinggu District); &lt;/span >; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, Simkai, Stkaiti;&quot;>; 1966, graduated from the Department of Law of Beijing University of Political Science and Law (now China University of Political Science and Law); Taking judicial, education, and administrative work; in 1978, he was admitted to the Department of Law of the Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

The vegetables planted in the field two days ago. After lunch break, work in front of the desk. Then go to the ground to do some work and exercise at night.

Children in the east, south, and northern regions of Pinggu can read. It was found that there was only one open space. The first thing we went to school was to dig the foundation and build a house. After more than half a year, there was a classroom and cafeteria, and a basketball court was simply repaired. Students borrowed villagers&#39; houses as dormitories and kitchens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; At that time, the school&#39;s funds were not enough. There was just a shoe factory for cloth shoes. We contracted some projects in the factory. My shoe -making technology is better, so I made me a supervisor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; During the middle school entrance examination, the county received hundreds of high school students. I was the first to enter high school in the village. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; During the college entrance examination, only the three doors of mathematics, Chinese, and chemistry are taken. In the summer, I was lying on the wild, and the hillside looked at the clear sky. The meteor was one after another. The Milky Way was clearly visible. Therefore, when I reported the volunteer of the university, I volunteered to report the astronomical department, but I only recruited a few people.

The main schools of politics and laws, in the past two years, studied Marxism and criticized correctionism in the past two years. After graduating from college, I was assigned to Guangxi, but the Guangxi receiving unit issued a telegram: &quot;Please report it temporarily.&quot; This slowly slowed for two years. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>;>; &quot;>; What is the most impressive after going to Guangxi two years later? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Chen Yunsheng: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; I have just arrived in Guangxi, but the luggage has not been opened. Leaders organized employees to send me gongs and drums to send me to the countryside to receive education in the poor and middle peasants for labor. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; I was assigned to a village on the border between China and Vietnam, and lived with farmers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; I live in the lower floor of the building, and the soles of my feet are facing the cow shed. The space under my bed is not wasted. It is the chicken cage next door. At three or four in the morning, the head cow began to defecate, the feces were hot, and immediately spread to the entire building, and then the dog under my bed began to defecate. These are trivial matter. Dog dung I clean up every morning. The smell of cow dung is unpleasant, but it is not stained. The hardest thing is the Chicken Si Chen, so that I can&#39;t rest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; I was very uncomfortable at first. After more than half a year of hard work, I could finally walk gravel roads like the local farmers, and the waterfield. Like a well -known authentic farmer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The biggest harvest of my rural areas in Guangxi is: to be hungry, tempering the tough will, laying a deep foundation for my later life development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: Kai style, Kaiti_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; Graduate test? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Chen Yunsheng: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; After staying in the countryside for two years, I returned to the county, and then again Member of the Rural Humanities Education Team. Although I studied university, I didn&#39;t have any room for their own places. I felt my future. On the other hand, my native concept is strong, so the soil is difficult to leave, and I still want to return to the north to develop. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; One day in 1977, his wife suddenly trusted me to bring me from the county seat, saying that the country had to recruit students. I understand it, it is indeed an opportunity. But I didn&#39;t learn solidly in college. I stayed in the countryside for another 10 years. I did n’t read it and did n’t listen. At that time, I thought that the batch of undergraduates who graduated in 1962 were more than 400, and more than a thousand people who graduated two or three years ago. Many of these people have already become a family, many people have become leaders, and they have stable income and family. Therefore, there are not many people who apply for the exam in the end. It is estimated that there are a hundred people. I still decided to try it, and I asked the county leader to report. He was very supportive and asked me to return to the county seat to prepare for the exam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: Kai style, Kaiti_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; For a few years, how to prepare for the exam? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Chen Yunsheng: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; There were only two months of preparation time at that time, the first problem was, me, me, me Can&#39;t find a book, especially there is no professional book to read. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Another problem is English, and English in college is basically deserted. I borrowed junior high school textbooks and started to learn from ABCD. I didn&#39;t have the bottom in my heart. I studied for two or three months. I thought that I had a director and could take the exam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, Kaiti_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; What about the exam? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Chen Yunsheng: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; The day before the exam, I still memorized teaching materials on the train, the 1975 constitution and the Constitution and Some newspaper articles. The test topic is also the heavenly help me. I remember the composition title at that time &quot;follow the new Long March with Chairman Hua&quot;, and the legal test questions were five words- &quot;French Civil War&quot;. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Leading the new Long March, the composition is a more familiar political discourse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; During the preparation of the exam, I borrowed some books on Marxistitarianism.对书中讲述的无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的文章，例如《哥达纲领批判》《法兰西内战》等反复阅读，多有体会，所以对法理学考题应答起来，自然就顺畅了。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;我们5个人一般都不准离开单位，24小时坚守工作岗位，一来指示我们马上调研，不舍昼夜地写调研报告，当时都只能在办公室里简单休息一下，夜深了，我们自己买碗泡面吃。那时找资料很难，学术界一片荒芜。法学所里有过去清华北大转来的图书，二十多年没人看，灰尘都有一寸厚，我就把尘土扒开找资料。从1980年开始准备，到1982年宪法修改完成，我们这样一直坚持了两年多。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;制宪的流程很复杂。我们只是做最初步的工作，报告提交后，秘书处的专家们又汇总征求各方意见，再提到领导层面。草案通过后，一共由《人民日报》公布了三次征求意见。当时民众参与热情很高，可能希望通过宪法的制定和实施，永远结束“文革”那样的社会无序和国家混乱的状态。在全民参与讨论过程中，收集了三千多条意见，甚至连哪个字、哪个标点该用什么，都有人提出来。 &lt;/p>;

82宪法通过后，宪法一下变成全民瞩目的大事件。首先是大量的宣传，当时连我这种“小喽啰”发表在报纸上的豆腐块文章都有上百篇。出版社也纷纷向我们约稿，从领导到专家，到我们这些小人物。我广泛地参与出版新宪法宣传的小册子，不下几十本。在这个过程中我就“小有名气”了。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;说到张友渔先生，你对他有什么特别的印象？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;陈云生：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;因为修改宪法，我和张友渔先生有了往来，当时他已经八十多岁，觉得我写的文章比较耐看，所以喜欢找我帮他撰写文稿，然后由他修改，我也实际上承担了他的文字秘书工作。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;1982年左右，国务院有领导提倡由几位泰斗级的老专家以传统的“师徒”形式培养学术传承人，当时张友渔先生就选了我。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;从学一年多，国家改变了传承的师徒模式，正式改为现代博士教育制度。我就参加国家规定的博士生考试，考法理、宪法、英语和政治，我是唯一的考生，就这样成了他的博士研究生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;作为学者要保持“平常心”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你跟随张先生研究宪法学，后来怎么具体关注宪法监督了？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;陈云生：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;因为82宪法实施后，它只是一个文本上的法律规定。但政府机关执行过程中是否正义、是否符合理性、宪法的实施和监督机制是否科学，都需要继续研究。自然而然，我就进入宪法监督理论的研究中，宪法监督司法化是我十几年来的主攻方向，我先后出版了3本书，其中一本是我修改和扩容后的博士论文。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;宪法学的宿命注定要和国家最高权力打交道。当时我极力主张把全国人大常委会的法律委员会改成宪法和法律委员会。这是我提出来的，后来经宪法学界一代又一代反复论证，2018年，终于在全国人大常委会设立“宪法和法律委员会”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你怎么看学术与政治的关系？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;陈云生：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;学术不能脱离社会，也不可能与政治完全隔绝。有相当一部分学者，他们将自己主要的学术兴趣和注意力放在直接为现实的政治、法律服务上面。这本无可厚非，现实的问题当然需要有人去研究，这也是一门大学问，而且是更为艰难的学问。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;>;问题是，做这种学问的人应当调整好自己的心态，要有如下的思想准备，即并不是任何针对现实问题作出的研究报告、提出的改进意见，都应当或可能被有关的政治决策机构所接受和采纳。我们说过，理论上的结论与政治上的决策并不总是相吻合的。理论上需要细推物理、洞幽察微，而政治上则要权衡利弊、趋利避害，两者所站立场不同，追求的价值目标不同，结论和决定自然也会不同。 As a scholar, it is important to maintain a &quot;normal mind.&quot;自己的意见被采纳了，自然是一件令人高兴和鼓舞的事，即使没有被采纳，也不应当感到失望和灰心。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;就你而言，做学问的乐趣何在？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;陈云生：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我的书出版了，有人去看、去体会，你觉得好就接受，不好就拒斥。但我们做学问本身不考虑它的影响，那是时人和后人是否认同的问题。 It may be thirty or fifty years before anyone is interested in reading the book I wrote in depth. I know that at that time there was a scholar who had done such research and had such advanced ideological understanding. I don’t expect anyone of this generation to understand. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;>;做学术不只是为了博取实际利益，为学也是一种“稻粱之谋”、养家糊口的一种手段，之外我做学术还是为了增加我的学识。我按照自己的研究思路摸索前进，勇于探索，一生治学、自甘寂寞，绝不为潮流所动，不跟风。所以我在某学会上自嘲说，我是学术界的孤魂野鬼。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;>;我只想把这学问做深做透，做到我自认为成熟的程度，就能从中感受到乐趣。我的学生说，30年过去了，现在还在研究我当时研究“宪法监督”的主题。因为宪法监督的研究任务任重道远。在学术生涯中，我走过一段有意义又曲折的道路，我如果能把这方面学问做到极致，也是一种能聊以自慰的幸事。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;“我为故我在”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong >;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;现在年轻人，不管是找工作还是考研究生，都面临激烈的竞争，同时他们也较为迷茫.你对年轻人有什么建议？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;陈云生：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我在北师大教了七八年书，这个情况我深有体会。一个硕士或博士考进来，第一件事是考证，司法从业资格证、计算机证书、雅思等。 3年的时间你要考五六个证，哪有时间去学习看书？证考得差不多了，就该四处投简历找工作了。等到硕士论文答辩还有两周时，他才匆忙拼凑论文，其质量可想而知。我一向告诉学生做好学问，将来不愁找不到工作，是金子都要发光的。这个社会总是要由有学识、有远见的人才能支撑起来。但第二，社会竞争这么激烈，毕业即失业，现在很多人博士毕业送外卖，这是很现实的。如果你一开始把自己的起点放这么低，就找份工作养家糊口，我们的社会怎么能进步？过去我们讲“我思故我在”，现在我觉得是“我为故我在”，你之所以成为你，都是你自己做过的事造就的。个人自我实现、获得成功，总是要付出很大乃至毕生的努力。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;您怎么看待现在的硕士、博士培养制度? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;陈云生：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我认为我们现在的培养制度是一种灌输式教育，而且严进宽out.我读博时，老师们三五星期才上一堂课，主要是靠自己跑到外面听讲座、听学术会议，千万百计地扩大知识面。我在美国访学时，学校每天邀请一个外校或本校的教授在午饭时做主题演讲，其他人边吃边听，或放下刀叉举手提问，分分钟都不浪费。现在的学生对参与学术活动也没有那么活跃了。所以现在和以前的培养模式差别主要是，一个是灌输式的，一个是启发式的；一个是开放式，一个封闭式的。 &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 18 Nov 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
