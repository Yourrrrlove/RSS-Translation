Musk actually proposed to immigrate to Mars?&quot; Xiao Ai was reading an article introducing Musk The article on the Mars Immigration Plan said with emotion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Yes, Musk is indeed an entrepreneur with great imagination and creativity. It is hard to say whether Musk&#39;s plan will succeed, but it is really possible for humans to immigrate to Mars.&quot; Dad continued Over topic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Impossible? Do I know that Mars is dry, cold, and airless? It is a desert where living things cannot survive. Crops cannot be grown on Mars. What will the people on Earth eat when they immigrate there? Is it like the movie &quot; Does the protagonist Mark in &quot;The Martian&quot; grow potatoes like that?&quot; Xiao Ai usually reads popular science books and movies about Mars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Growing potatoes on Mars is still a bit far away, but it is not difficult to build a &#39;happy farm&#39; in space. It is also very possible to build a space farm on the moon or Mars in the future.&quot; Dad replied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Really? I suddenly became interested in how to build this space farm. Dad, tell me about it!&quot; Xiao Ai said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Okay.&quot; Dad Ai said with a little thought. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Happy Farm&quot; has many benefits&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Imagine if you are lucky enough to become an astronaut and have to live alone on the International Space Station for a year Half a year. At first, you look down at the blue earth for a while, and look up at the dazzling starry sky for a while. It feels very beautiful. But as time goes by, will you feel even more lonely in the small space station? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you can grow vegetables and flowers in the space station, and watch the seeds slowly grow green buds every day, grow up little by little, blossom and bear fruit, during this period, you can also give Fertilize, water, prune, and pollinate these plants. Record their growth process every day. At the same time, do some experimental records, occasionally take some beautiful photos or videos, and then share them with colleagues, family, and the public on earth. Will it add a lot of fun to your space life? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the nutritionists at the space center do their best to prepare delicious and nutritious food for you, the spacecraft&#39;s load is limited after all, so they have to compress and re-compress the food as much as possible to make packaged food. When you eat these packaged foods every day, you will definitely feel monotonous and boring, and the nutrients of these packaged foods, especially vitamin C, vitamin K, etc., will gradually be lost. If from time to time you could eat salads made from fresh vegetables and fruits grown by yourself, wouldn’t that be considered a delicacy in the world? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Imagine further that at some time in the future, more and more humans will work, travel or even settle on the moon, Mars and other planets. Will they need a lot of food, which must be transported entirely from the earth? Food costs are going to be very high. If some reusable space farms can be built on the moon, Mars or other planets to grow fresh vegetables, fruits, flowers and even food, providing enough fresh food for human space travelers, it may be an important basis for future interstellar immigration. one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/cMRt6xzzXGZRNcrSLdt1yiGqvwhtRvha8BQNsRuR.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1066&quot; height= &quot;1066&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/cMRt6xzzXGZRNcrSLdt1yiGqvwhtRvha8BQNsRuR.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252163&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zinnias planted by astronauts on the International Space Station. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(NASA/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Growing vegetables in space has become commonplace&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Human beings The unknown world is full of curiosity, and human exploration of the vast universe has never stopped. Since taking the first step into outer space, humans have begun to explore the impact of the space environment on various animals, plants and even microorganisms. Whether plants can grow in the space environment and whether they can provide fresh food for space travelers. Especially after the completion of the space station, astronauts have enough space and time to help scientists on earth answer these questions, and also add some fun and nutrition to the astronauts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1982, astronauts on the Soviet Salyut 7 space station used a miniature greenhouse device to conduct the first &quot;from seed to seed&quot; full life cycle cultivation experiment of Arabidopsis thaliana, proving that plants on earth can be Growth and seeding outside the earth have opened up human attempts to grow vegetables, flowers, and grains in space. In the following ten years, Soviet astronauts completed space cultivation experiments of various plants. However, these plants grown in space were not for human consumption, but were limited to scientific research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is American astronauts who actually grow vegetables to eat in space. In order to allow astronauts to eat fresh vegetables, fruits or other fresh foods, NASA has developed some plant cultivation devices, such as the vegetable production system Veggie and the advanced plant habitat APH. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The vegetable production system is a small plant growth device suitable for space stations that can automatically provide light, water, air and nutrients for vegetable growth. It is only the size of a suitcase and can generally grow 6 types of vegetables. . Since 2014, American astronauts have used vegetable production systems on the International Space Station to cultivate lettuce, Chinese cabbage, Chinese cabbage, kale, mustard, zinnias and other plants. Some of them are for scientific research, and some are used by astronauts. Eat it as a salad, I heard it tastes great. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The advanced plant habitat is a more complex, more automated, fully enclosed plant growth device equipped with cameras and more than 180 sensors that can monitor light, temperature, humidity, atmospheric content, etc. Sensing and controlling, and staying connected to the ground laboratory so that observations and research can be carried out simultaneously on the ground and the space station. Advanced plant habitat installations enable more complex, diverse, and long-term plant growth studies. So far, American astronauts have used this device to conduct full life cycle cultivation experiments of Arabidopsis thaliana, dwarf wheat, radish, pepper and other plants. The pepper planting test is the longest and most &quot;stimulating&quot; test among them. After more than three months of growth, the pepper seeds have gone through the entire process of germination, flowering, fruiting, and maturity. In November 2021, after the peppers matured, the astronauts stored part of them and left them for ground laboratories to conduct follow-up analysis and research, while the other parts were made into delicacies by them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/ZOmrdJMaHYfre5mMIu8NlOZMBXsOfVQDFKQj0KOM.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1032&quot; height= &quot;688&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/ZOmrdJMaHYfre5mMIu8NlOZMBXsOfVQDFKQj0KOM.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252165&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Astronauts pose with the peppers they grow on the International Space Station. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(NASA/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Rice bears seeds on the Chinese space station&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Shenzhou The first manned flight on the 5th, Yutu&#39;s visit to the moon, Zhurong&#39;s inspection of Mars, the &quot;reunion in space&quot; of the Chinese space station... The booming Chinese aerospace industry has also injected new vitality into the exploration of space farms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2019, a mysterious scientific device was transported to the far side of the moon by the Chinese lunar probe Chang&#39;e-4, where it was performing an important mission. This scientific device was developed by scientists from Chongqing University and contains four kinds of seeds, including cotton, rape, potato, and Arabidopsis, as well as two animal eggs, yeast and fruit fly. After landing on the far side of the moon, the seeds that were originally dormant began to wake up and enter growth and development mode. Within nine days, the seeds began to germinate, and the cotton seeds also sprouted buds. Although the germination of cotton seeds on the moon is just a flash in the pan, this is the first green leaf to grow on the moon. Perhaps in the near future, more plants will sprout, bloom and bear fruit on the moon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the newly built Chinese space station, Chinese astronauts started longer-term plant growth experiments. This time the test subjects were Arabidopsis thaliana and rice. As we all know, rice originated in China and is one of China&#39;s main food crops. No one has ever conducted a full life cycle cultivation experiment of rice in space before. During the four-month test, both Arabidopsis and rice successfully completed the entire life cycle of seed germination, seedling growth, flowering and seeding, proving that rice can grow on the space station. However, scientists have observed that many indicators of rice grown on the space station are significantly different from rice grown on the ground, such as earlier flowering period, longer grain filling time, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rice generally has the ability to regenerate. The rice stalks left behind after normal harvest can also grow rice ears, thus increasing rice yield. This experiment also observed the regeneration ability of rice on the space station. As a result, more than 20 days after the rice was harvested, a rice plant on the space station also regenerated and grew two rice ears, indicating that regenerating rice is feasible in a small closed environment. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our country has achieved world-leading scientific and technological achievements in the field of aerospace breeding. It is believed that with the in-depth development of aerospace projects such as the China Space Station, the Moon Landing Project and the Planetary Exploration Project, our country’s astronauts will be in a wider field. Grow vegetables, flowers, and crops in space to bring fresh, nutritious and delicious food to future space travelers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Km6QSDoE6uvnXPxyRos0LJ1iz8pZkqoCacoyIswX.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;806&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Km6QSDoE6uvnXPxyRos0LJ1iz8pZkqoCacoyIswX.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252164&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Rice seeds growing in the Chinese space station. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;How far is it from the real space farm&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;However, so far So far, these plant cultivation experiments conducted in the space station have been extremely small-scale. It is a huge challenge to actually build a space farm, and there are still many problems that need to be solved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether it is the moon or Mars, the harsh environment is not suitable for plant growth at all. Therefore, the first step in building a space farm is to build a large-scale intelligently controlled greenhouse facility, similar to the intelligent greenhouses built on the earth, so that Plants have &quot;houses&quot; to live in. First of all, this greenhouse facility is completely airtight, can maintain stable temperature, and can protect plants and humans from cosmic rays. Secondly, this greenhouse facility is suitable for remote control, which requires full monitoring of the growth process of plants and timely control of temperature and light. , atmosphere, moisture and nutrients are precisely controlled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second step is to allow the plants to &quot;eat and drink&quot; to maintain the operation of plant life and the operation of the entire greenhouse facility. The main power for greenhouse operation comes from solar power generation. This technology is not difficult, but it is a big problem to provide the necessary soil, nutrients, water, atmosphere, etc. for plant growth. Soil mainly provides support and nutrients for the growth of plant roots. Studies have shown that plants can grow in lunar soil or volcanic ash, but they will grow more slowly than in earth soil. In addition to soil, hydroponics can also be used. This smart greenhouse is relatively common on the earth. Of course, hydroponics requires a lot of water. The moon and Mars are both dry planets with little water and require artificial synthesis. This means that water must be accurately distributed to plants according to their needs. Plants also need carbon dioxide for photosynthesis, and nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are needed for plant growth. These need to be synthesized or extracted by making full use of raw materials on the planet where they are located. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the &quot;housing&quot; and &quot;food and drink&quot; problems are solved, the protagonist can be invited out. At this time, it is very important to choose what kind of plants to plant. Not all plants are suitable for space farms. First, these candidate plants must be able to adapt to the unfavorable conditions of space, such as microgravity, high radiation, large temperature differences, lack of water and fertilizer; secondly, candidate plants should be rich in vitamins, antioxidants and other nutrients to provide space for astronauts, space tourists or settlers. Supplement additional nutrients; in addition, candidate plants should have the characteristics of short growth cycle, small space occupation, and easy management. In addition to selecting existing plant varieties, in the future, scientists may tailor special plant varieties for space farms, such as potatoes that are more suitable for growing in Martian ash, tomatoes that grow better under microgravity conditions, etc. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, each plant to be grown on the space farm needs to be carefully selected and passed simulation tests in ground laboratories to accurately calculate the nutrients, moisture, atmosphere, light, etc. required for its growth. , in order to minimize the waste of resources in space. It is worth mentioning that NASA assigned this part of the work to middle school students. NASA has launched a &quot;Growing Beyond Earth&quot; public welfare program, inviting middle school students across the United States to participate in space plant growth research and select plants suitable for planting on the International Space Station. As of December 2022, more than 40,000 middle school students and their instructors have participated in this activity, and screening tests of more than 180 types of plants have been carried out, and pak choi grown on the vegetable production system is one of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China’s manned moon landing plan is being steadily implemented, and the U.S. government also plans to return to the moon. Musk even proposed to build a self-sufficient city on Mars around 2050, and it is possible for humans to settle outside the earth. The day seems to be getting closer, when the construction of space farms is an indispensable link, which requires future scientists around the world to continue to improve space farms, maybe you can also participate in it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[书籍背后，隐形的人：宁成春的六十年]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257645]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/25/xIbJ7A8GZuLEmVxoLbqkz1CUXdwzffSWAxpGpWcn.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1067&quot; height=&quot;1600&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/xIbJ7A8GZuLEmVxoLbqkz1CU XdwzffSWAxpGpWcn. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252129&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Ning Chengchun, a book designer who is over eighty years old, has spent nearly a decade in his design career , more than 1,500 books were born from his hands, which is almost equivalent to a history of contemporary Chinese publishing. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;81-year-old book binding designer Ning Chengchun is still living the life of an office worker . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he has work, Ning Chengchun takes the bus to and from his studio in Chaoyang, working from nine to five. In 2002, he retired from Sanlian Bookstore and established his own studio. Retirement just means changing places and continuing to design books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When drawing design drawings, Ning Chengchun&#39;s sitting posture was the same as when he was young: his back was straight, his shoulder blades were arched, and his head was slightly bent. He is still used to wearing shirts. The biggest change in his appearance is that he has grown a silvery white beard and trimmed it neatly after getting older. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are various books, a computer, and a pot of tea on his work table. Through the window on the left, sunlight pours in. The computer was for the assistant. Ning Chengchun used pens, rulers, and grid paper. The covers and layouts that were drawn by hand were handed to the assistant and turned into computer files. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are two book walls in the studio, and one of the bookshelves contains books he designed himself. In August 2023, he published the collection &quot;A Person&#39;s History of Book Design&quot;. In his nearly one year of design career, he has produced more than 1,500 books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These sixty years are equivalent to a history of contemporary Chinese publishing. In 1986, after Sanlian Bookstore resumed its independent establishment, Ning Chengchun became the first director of the art department. His works outline the historical changes of Sanlian Bookstore. The &quot;Reading and Writing Series&quot; closely related to the publisher Fan Yong established the ideological banner of the 1980s; &quot;Huai Ju Shi Cun&quot; and &quot;Bathing&quot; designed for Qian Zhongshu and Yang Jiang set a precedent for writing books for a large number of scholars. ; &quot;Collection of Jin Yong&#39;s Works&quot; has made countless fans of Jin Yong bow and remain unforgettable to this day; &quot;Chen Yinke&#39;s Last 20 Years&quot; inspired the &quot;Chen Yinke craze&quot; in the 1990s; the &quot;Local China&quot; series has led the creation of &quot;picture books&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of the editor of Sanlian Bookstore, Ning Chengchun is not old at all. When he has an important manuscript, he still asks him to contribute as he has done for decades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the balcony, a Monstera deliciosa grows as tall as a person. It was given to Ning Chengchun by his colleagues when he was hospitalized in 2008. Assistant Hu Changyue met Ning Chengchun in 2006. At that time, Ning Chengchun was working hard. At most, he hired 6 assistants to cooperate with the design. During his hospitalization, Ning Chengchun was still drawing layouts even in the hospital bed. The nurse reminded him to stop drawing and take a good rest. Within a week of his heart bypass surgery, he was back in the studio. &quot;If you can&#39;t do it in a day, you can do it for half a day.&quot; Hu Changyue recalled to a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the second year after the operation, Ning Chengchun decided to close his studio, but many people continued to approach him for design, but the number of orders was reduced, and the work did not really stop. In 2019, Ning Chengchun underwent another heart stent surgery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that the collection of works has been published and is selling well, he wants to &quot;retire&quot; as soon as possible, writing, painting, and reading books that he had no time to read before. But when someone asked him to design some books, he still couldn&#39;t bear to refuse. The National Library wanted to publish &quot;The Complete Collection of Dunhuang Documents&quot;, and he agreed, &quot;This is a very important book. You can&#39;t just watch it fail.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Changyue said that Ning Chengchun received the invitation, I was actually very happy in my heart, but my body really couldn’t bear it. The job of declining various design invitations was left to Hu Changyue. When faced with requests from others, Ning Chengchun would most likely nod, &quot;Okay,&quot; &quot;Okay, okay.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun likes natural, folk and humanistic things. The books in his studio are dotted with various traditional artifacts he collected: blue and white porcelain, Pixiu stone carvings, and paper-cuts. His collection is all based on hobbies and nothing expensive or rare. While out hunting, I saw the cute porcelain bowls in farmers’ homes, so I bought a few from the local second-hand market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He took out a set of picture albums that he bought from the Panjiayuan Secondhand Bookstore. They were all full of line-drawn bronzes. He had bought a 32-karat version before and the pictures were very small. This set has a large format and the decorations are clear at a glance. &quot;Actually, there were many good things in ancient times.&quot; Ning Chengchun murmured. In the past twenty years, he has experimented with various traditional patterns, either using them on the spine of books or using a continuous square pattern as the background of the cover. His designs have become increasingly quaint and solemn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Ning Chengchun’s eyes, utensils are used by ordinary people in their daily lives. They are made by unknown craftsmen and may look humble, but they have the beauty of everyday life. Books are utensils that serve people, and they should also have &quot;the beauty of utensils.&quot; Literary theorist Chao Wen once said, &quot;The art of binding is the soul of book aesthetics.&quot; Ning Chengchun deeply agrees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/w6CnLaxNeAhI3NTtNyendEzVb4nrAsxVucvuSfKU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1156&quot; height= &quot;1600&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/w6CnLaxNeAhI3NTtNyendEzVb4nrAsxVucvuSfKU.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252130&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1985, Ning Chengchun was at Kodansha Japan. In the 1980s, he went to Japan twice for further study, allowing Ning Chengchun to truly and systematically study design, and his design concepts were in line with the world. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;This is what this book should look like&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>;A variety of teas are placed on the dining table in the studio. Ning Chengchun always makes a cup of tea when guests visit. The book designer&#39;s studio is also a living room. Editors, printing staff, and suppliers often come to the door. Ning Chengchun has long been accustomed to switching between putting down and picking up design drafts at any time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At home, the time after getting up in the morning and before going to bed at night is the quietest time. Ning Chengchun likes to conceive designs at these moments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After visiting his studio, Zhang Lixian, the founder of Duku, said: &quot;The designers I have come into contact with are all very good-tempered. I think it&#39;s because they communicate too much with editors and are polished. I have a good temper.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of Ning Chengchun&#39;s early masterpieces, &quot;The Journey to the West&quot;, designed 12 drafts, three or four plans each time, and submitted it for review several times before it was approved. The highest record is a book on international trade, with 20 drafts designed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the plan was called back, what Ning Chengchun thought was, &quot;Maybe because I didn&#39;t understand the book or didn&#39;t meet his ideas, I will continue to do it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Mindset Only if you are better can you persist for sixty years.&quot; Ning Chengchun attributed this to his family influence. His brother was labeled as a rightist, and the family lost income. His mother taught him from an early age to work seriously, argue for words, and talk less. No matter at school or at work, Ning Chengchun was used to working hard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Ning Chengchun entered the industry in his early days, all he could think about was design. When he woke up every morning, his mind was already spinning even before he was fully awake. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There were many political movements at that time. When a book was published by a publishing house, all the art editors would design it, and then choose from many designs. In other words, it may be in vain. Ning Chengchun didn&#39;t care about this and just kept busy. He is the youngest but has been selected the most times. For many years, Ning Chengchun designed sixty or seventy books every year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1992, when he designed the book &quot;Yixing Zisha Appreciation&quot;, Ning Chengchun had no knowledge of Zisha teapots and tea. He and his photographer traveled to 24 places across the country to take photos of classic Zisha teapots. Due to the limitations of technology at that time, many of the negatives produced were color cast, but Ning Chengchun had seen and touched all the teapots, and listened to the explanations of Gu Jingzhou, an expert on purple clay teapots, so he repeatedly adjusted the color tone of the layout with the plate maker based on his feeling and memory. When printing at the printing factory, Ning Chengchun woke up once every hour and 15 minutes in order to supervise the color effect, and stared at it for four days and nights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Post-80s designers Xu Yijun and Ning Chengchun went to the printing factory together. During the book printing process, color shades or technical details may not be completely accurate, and some differences are difficult to discern with the naked eye. Designers need to be on-site to help solve the problem. Printing was done all night long, and Ning Chengchun sometimes had to get up in the middle of the night to go to the workshop to look at the samples. Now that he was old, Xu Yijun and other young designers persuaded him to take a rest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Hu Changyue&#39;s eyes, Ning Chengchun&#39;s rigor in publications was beyond imagination. Once when a picture book was being produced, the quality of one picture was not good enough. The editor said that there was only this picture and there was no way to replace it. Ning Chengchun said sternly that if a higher quality picture could not be found, this picture must be used for publication. , he stopped doing it. Finally, he and the editor rummaged through the box and found the negative of the picture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jiaming, former deputy editor-in-chief of Sanlian, compared book design to building a house, “After a book editor has worked hard to compile a good book, he will always consciously or unconsciously imagine what the designer will design it to look like. ”, and the designer arranges the graphics and text content appropriately to create a reading space that looks attractive from the outside, allowing readers to walk in without any obstacles and is pleasing to the eye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;A manuscript is just a stack of paper. To form a book, it must be designed. The quality of the design has a great influence on the book.&quot; Ning Chengchun said that after the book is finished, others will read it and feel that it is a good book. It should look like this, and he would be happy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/c0sy4P7398JfwDUR9toiBjcD4ECRxLJT3qVHMq4X.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1600&quot; height= &quot;1302&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/c0sy4P7398JfwDUR9toiBjcD4ECRxLJT3qVHMq4X.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252131&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;When he entered the industry in his early days, Ning Chengchun designed sixty or seventy books a year. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Design is not just a cover&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>; Ning Chengchun loved books. When he was in middle school, Yang Shuo&#39;s generation of writers came into public view. He read many Chinese literary works. At that time, Tianjin People&#39;s Publishing House and Baihua Literature and Art Publishing House were publishing with high quality, which he still remembers today. Many small books published by Baihua Literature and Art are &quot;very lively and have illustrations. The illustrations of Zhang Deyu and Wang Guofeng are very famous.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun’s eldest brother taught art in school. Under his influence, Ning Chengchun liked painting since he was a child. Mass cultural and artistic activities are also active in Tianjin. Ning Chengchun took the painting class of the district cultural center and went to the old house with several floors to paint in his spare time every week. When he was in junior high school, he published some sketches in newspapers and periodicals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;His first choice in the college entrance examination was the printmaking department. Printmaking played a propaganda role in various movements during the Anti-Japanese War and the early days of the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China. It was &quot;down-to-earth and not too lofty.&quot; At that time, many book illustrations were created by printmakers, and he also hoped to work in a publishing house. In the end, he was admitted to his second choice and entered the Decoration Department of the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts. Three years later, he was transferred to the book art major. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1960s, there was no systematic modern design teaching in China, and most of what Ning Chengchun came into contact with was painting education. For those who study painting, they prefer design literature books, political economic philosophy books, and can only do abstract designs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He clearly remembers the first academic book he designed, &quot;Wittgenstein&quot;. The philosophy book was difficult to understand, and I couldn’t use too concrete paintings to express it. I designed many drafts, but they didn’t pass. Ning Chengchun went to the publishing house&#39;s library to look through the collection of paintings, searching for modern paintings from Wittgenstein&#39;s period, trying to figure out the relationship between Mondrian and others&#39; paintings and philosophy, and finally applied large color blocks to the cover design. Later, when designing a series of triplex academic books, Ning Chengchun would start with abstract patterns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Yijun asked Ning Chengchun why his contemporaries who studied design changed careers one after another, but he persisted. Ning Chengchun thought for a moment and replied, maybe because he went to Japan to study. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun truly and systematically studied design when he went to Japan for further study twice in 1984 and 1986. In Japan, Ning Chengchun personally studied design masters Sugiura Shohei and Manabe Kazuo, and took up basic design courses to integrate with the world in design concepts. At that time, all domestic design relied on painting, and no one knew how to use grids. Ning Chengchun returned from his studies and helped Sanlian usher in the era of picture books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From Ning Chengchun’s graduation to 1995, nearly thirty years of the printing era, all design was done by hand. With the advent of computers, printing was gradually eliminated, and he was still used to designing on paper first. Ning Chengchun did not know how to operate a computer. At that time, the computer company next to the publishing house had five computers. He sat in the middle, drew the layout, and directed five assistants to use the computers to complete the work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Designers of Lu Mingjing’s generation basically complete the entire design process on the computer, while Ning Chengchun still maintains the habit of manual grid design. It was pictures and books that prompted Lu Mingjing to learn from Ning Chengchun. The first task she received was to design Jiang Xun&#39;s &quot;History of Chinese Art for Everyone&quot;. The pictures were many and the text was fragmented, and the layout was difficult to form a block, which was very unsightly. Facing such a book, Lu Mingjing, who had just entered the industry, was confused. Wang Jiaming suggested that she go to Ning Chengchun&#39;s studio to study. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun took out several pieces of octavo paper, a ruler, and a pen, and showed Lu Mingjing how to use a grid to draw a layout, and accurately calculate the number of words on each page and the size of the pictures. &quot;The pictures and text information are all controlled on the manuscript paper, instead of pushing it page by page, and falling into the dilemma of having to redo the entire book if a few pictures are changed.&quot; Lu Mingjing realized that the seemingly backward grid design , actually has its own advantages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While studying at Sugiura Kohei&#39;s studio, Ning Chengchun understood the meaning of what he said: &quot;A book is a universe.&quot; Later, Ning Chengchun introduced Sugiura Kohei&#39;s theory for the first time in China. Sugiura Kohei emphasized the overall design and the core position of the book binding designer in the book design process, &quot;from the layout of the text, text, font, font size, title, table of contents, title page, cover, letter sleeve, belt to the copyright page, and the design of All paper and material selections, and printing and binding process settings are within the scope of the book designer&#39;s responsibilities. Modern book design concepts were promoted in China, and everyone began to understand that design is not just about making a cover. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Yijun observed that in the early days of Ning Chengchun’s design career, design was often regarded as a vassal and branch of painting and lacked independence. As one of the first batch of book designers to study in Japan, Ning Chengchun mastered the professionalism of design. Coupled with his &quot;persistent pursuit of the design profession, including personal talents and opportunities&quot;, multiple factors superimposed to support his departure. Come down. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“I did what I should do for this book”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When Ning Chengchun came back from Japan, he was over forty and his hair began to turn gray. When he made &quot;Chen Yinke&#39;s Last 20 Years&quot; in 1995, his hair turned gray overnight. The 200,000-word manuscript that fascinated him was once stolen along with his backpack. Ning Chengchun couldn&#39;t describe the pain. In just a few days, regret and guilt turned his hair white. Fortunately, two weeks later, the thief who took away the wages left the manuscript at the door of the neighborhood committee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun chose a black cover for this book because both the content itself and the author&#39;s writing made him feel the intensity of emotion and the depression of the atmosphere. He compressed the catalog together, arranged it into an upside-down, fragmented, and disorderly combination, and placed it on the top of the cover to express the condensation of the last 20 years of the author&#39;s life. The photo of Chen Yinke on the lower right was one that Ning Chengchun spotted at a glance from many photos - his eyes were blind, but still bright, and he was holding the crutch tightly with both hands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It particularly represents Mr. Chen&#39;s spiritual atmosphere in his later years, lonely and determined, as if staring at us descendants in the heavy shadow of history.&quot; He believes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Hua, the person in charge of Shenzhen Shangshu Bar, has collected more books designed by Ning Chengchun than Ning Chengchun himself. He began to pay attention to book binding design in the 1990s and found that each book presented a different state. Sanlian&#39;s books were quite different from other publishing houses, being more elegant and heavy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Zhang Hua’s view, Ning Chengchun’s designs reveal a unique Chinese spirit. &quot;His creative language has absorbed the essence of traditional binding very well. He has taken deep roots. He also caught up with the reform and opening up. He went to Japan to study twice and learned modern techniques. He is not conservative at all, which is even more rare.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun often thinks about how to distinguish each book when designing. Every book is unique. To design well, a designer must first understand the author&#39;s thoughts and feelings, and then convey this understanding to readers through book binding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you encounter a book that attracts you, the design is often more inspiring. Ning Chengchun was very moved after reading &quot;Fu Shan&#39;s World&quot;. The author Bai Qianshen is an art history scholar. He originally studied international politics, but turned to calligraphy after studying in the United States. He tells the story of Fu Shan&#39;s ideological changes by examining the society in the late Ming Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When designing, Ning Chengchun used Fu Shan’s calligraphy works as the background. In a chaotic night sky, those characters slightly emitted seven-color light, as if flying from the depths of history, ancient and modern. The book has a wide influence and is constantly reprinted. Bai Qianshen highly approves of it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I did what I should do for this book.” When Ning Chengchun talks about these books that he has never forgotten, his words can go very far. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The understanding between designers and authors sometimes extends from books to reality. After retiring from Sanlian in 2002, Ning Chengchun received direct invitations from many authors. Wang Yuanhua and Zhong Shuhe both wrote letters asking him to design. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cultural relic expert Wang Shixiang asked a publishing house to design &quot;Jin Hui Hei&quot;. When printing, he found that the design format was wrong and could not be printed. He found Ning Chengchun for help. &quot;At that time, he had just lost the sight in his left eye, and he was so anxious that he was really trusting him with his life.&quot; The two became friends from then on. Wang Shixiang sometimes went to the Sanlian Art Studio to look at design drafts and invited Ning Chengchun to have dinner downstairs. Ning Chengchun once witnessed Wang Shixiang instructing the chef to improve the taste of eel paste. The next time he went back, the store made it according to his method. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This is no longer just reading a manuscript, the key points of the manuscript and the author&#39;s taste are all very clear.&quot; Wang Jiaming sighed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Hong Kong triptych edition of Wang Shixiang&#39;s &quot;Research on Ming Style Furniture&quot; is divided into volumes with pictures and texts. Ning Chengchun found it inconvenient to read, so when designing this book, he reintegrated the text narrative, picture explanation, and illustrations. Wang Shixiang&#39;s wife, Yuan Quanyou, did a lot of work for this book. Unfortunately, she passed away before the design of the book was completed. Ning Chengchun knew that Wang and Yuan had been together all their lives and had a deep love for each other, so he temporarily added and changed the design. He chose a black background for the cover, with a line drawing drawn by Yuan Quanyou printed in white gold stamping in the middle. There are two Ming-style chairs designed on the cover of the letter sleeve. One is a real photo, and the other is a line drawing of Yuan Quanyou, as if the two people met each other in heaven and earth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Hua was moved by a series of Wang Shixiang&#39;s works designed by Ning Chengchun: &quot;The younger generation does not know much about Wang Shixiang&#39;s pursuit and achievements. It can be presented perfectly, and the content and form are completely unified. That is very difficult and can only be designed after full understanding.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some books failed to be implemented according to his ideas, which will also become a regret that Ning Chengchun talks about. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When designing &quot;The Complete Works of Lu Xun&#39;s Manuscripts&quot;, he hoped to put the statue in front of the Lu Xun Memorial Hall - a more natural and life-like appearance - on the cover using 3D imaging technology. The effect was very good, but in the end the publisher chose a safer solution and used the black-and-white photos of Lu Xun in the textbook. Ning Chengchun felt that the design could have been more innovative. Now is no longer the era of &quot;cold eyebrows&quot;. &quot;Lu Xun&#39;s life was difficult and he had a fragile side.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“这也没办法，你是乙方嘛，人家是甲方。”宁成春笑笑，话锋又一转，“不过这个形式以后遇到合适的人还会用，一定要合适，一般的人也不合适。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;克服孤独就很难&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;宁成春给鲁明静展示过一个速写本，是他大学去参加四清运动时随身带着的，画下了沿途乡下的风景。从北京城里徒步穿越郊区，直到河北乡下，得走两三百里地。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;宁成春告诉她，现在也能走。鲁明静问，怎么走啊？宁成春说，安排一辆车，咱们就走，行李都放车上。你跟我走吗？鲁明静满口答应，心里想，嚯，还要重走一遍。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“凡是这种超出常人做的事儿，他都会鼓励你。”鲁明静发现。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;十几年前，他俩一同见过一位斫琴师。工坊在偏远的小山上，一个小茅草屋。他与弟子做的古琴价格不菲，足以让他们遗世独立，不为生计奔波。宁成春鼓励鲁明静：“你要成为这样的人！”鲁明静那时刚刚工作，有些迷茫，她理解他话中的意思——身怀绝技了，便不需再迷茫出世还是入世。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;许多宁成春的同代设计师都已成了画家、艺术家，徐弈君问过同样擅画的宁成春，他想不想成为艺术家，宁成春回答得很坚定：没有，就是一直要做设计师。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;徐弈君学设计时，同学们普遍认为设计不会是终身职业，“都用脚投票，都走了嘛”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;设计长期以来被视为实用美术，在重道轻器的传统思想中不受重视，艺术家与设计师在社会身份上有霄壤之别。徐弈君提起中国设计行业的断层，像宁成春这一代还在做书的40后，屈指可数。 “老辈的设计师虽然很少，但是还有，这个太宝贵了，要不然就很孤独。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;纸质书已然夕阳行业，学平面设计，可以转做互联网产品设计，收入更高。徐弈君说，纸质书利润不大，许多设计公司都是批量生产，“如果花那么多时间去做，可能难以生存”。宁成春这代设计师，在每一本书上花费大量心血，实属难得。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;鲁明静曾把书籍设计师分为哲学家、工程师、艺术家等不同类型和风格，宁成春选择的是与张扬自我的艺术家相背的路。他身上有激越的一面，但他甘于把自我缩小，将自己的名字隐没在一本本书的背后。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;宁成春在书里、采访中都强调了一件事。第八届全国书籍设计艺术展览上，一位日本设计理论家看了展品，说一个作者花许多时间写了书，如果设计者在这本书里夹杂个人的东西，是对文本作者极大的不尊重。 “这种现象在八展的展品上很普遍，就是脱离文本，或者强加文本出一些东西，为了吸引眼球，为了个人的炫技，不是为书，不是为文本，这种纯艺术的倾向，他说这是对书、作者的不尊重，但是没有人重视。”宁成春对南方周末记者说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于不符合自己理念的事情，宁成春总是不留情面地直陈。在一次赛事中，宁成春做评审，觉得其中程序很不合理，指出后也无改变，最后愤然退场走人。 “年轻人评奖……太讲名利了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于浮躁功利的风气，宁成春很警觉。 “功利放在最前面，所有东西都是为了功利，这就不行了。”在日本，他见过很多大学生出来做木工，也很好。社会不该如此单一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者到访时，宁成春手边在做雷殿生的书。对这位穿越罗布泊第一人，十年走遍中国的徒步者，宁成春很钦佩。他徒步的1990年代末，正值经济腾飞，各行各业都在赚钱。雷殿生却准备了十年，所有细节都提前预想，有计划、有能力，“他完全靠一个人，克服很多困难。首先克服孤独就很难的”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;宁成春总让徐弈君想起鲁迅的话：巨大的建筑，总是由一木一石叠起来的，我们何妨做做这一木一石呢？我时常做些零碎的事，就是为此。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“大家都想做惊天动地的事情，有英雄主义的想法，做这些平凡的事情是没有什么意义的。但是现在也不这么认为了。”徐弈君说，许多伟大的古代建筑，比如故宫，正是无名工匠设计的，“做普通的书也很重要，踏踏实实做事情。”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;徐弈君去年和宁成春一起工作了很长时间，他发现，不管去到哪个城市，宁成春身边总带着要设计的书，“一直看，一直看，吃了饭躺在床上，再把稿子拿出来读一下。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;宁成春总说，一生只做一件事。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（应受访者要求，徐弈君、章华为化名）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 09:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[傅首尔与老刘闹离婚说明了什么？“全职丈夫”难以得到尊重]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257545]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;傅首尔和老刘在节目中闹离婚这事，让综艺节目赚足了流量，但依然属于生活里的一部肥皂剧，虽然不能说是烂剧，但也是很多如我一样的人压根不喜欢看的剧情。即便如此，我们依然能从这一事件得到足够多的“教训”，其一便是：男人做“全职丈夫/全职爸爸”，因为社会对此接受度太低了，很难得到尊重。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;傅首尔和老刘经历过“贫贱夫妻百事哀”，算得上患难夫妻。傅首尔通过《奇葩说》崛起之后，老刘就开始了完全的“全职丈夫”以及傅首尔段子来源的生涯。就个体所能达到的高度而言，傅首尔绝对是一个女强人，是一个利用知识和口才走上独特赛道的成功人士，这一点毋庸置疑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在老刘回到家庭后方做起全职丈夫之后，两人关于婚姻的佳话，长期存在于互联网上。每次参加节目的时候，傅首尔几乎都会说起老刘对自己有多么好。傅首尔和老刘此前离过一次婚，后来，两人复婚了，原因是正处于事业上升期的傅首尔在离婚后工作生活一团糟。傅首尔也曾公开形容这段婚姻是“我所能遇到的最好的婚姻”。既然如此，那么此时又何以再次要走到那一步？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因为，两个人的地位和关系，已经不复从前。古人所言的“时位之移人”，在婚姻关系中也一定存在，今人所唏嘘的“经济能力决定家庭地位”，其实是真理。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当老刘在全职丈夫的生活中已经进阶到傅首尔踢一下自己“就知道该倒水了”、傅首尔明明身边就有垃圾桶却让老刘扔垃圾的时候，他们就再也“回不去了”。关于婚姻的幸福，也只剩下感觉了。 “我敢保证，我的老公当全职爸爸是十分开心的，我可以赚钱来养一家人”，傅首尔说这话时，老刘恰恰经历着最大的纠结时光。这说明，傅首尔已经不了解自己的丈夫了。而老刘也在被误读中失去了自我，成为一个符号。尽管他表示自己并不介意被傅首尔在节目中拿来当段子、被嘲笑，但我所体悟到的潜台词却是：前提是你得尊重我。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，傅首尔又是怎么说呢？她说：一个人为什么会一直做咸鱼，你们知道吗？因为他就适合做咸鱼，不求上进的信念一旦形成，他连呼吸都比别人慢，你不要鞭策，因为没有期待就没有伤害。如此表述当然有“节目需要”的成分，可是太多的细节早已影影绰绰显示傅首尔对老刘“不求上进”越发难以容忍，甚至可能她自己都没有意识到，自己已经把老刘当成一条周星驰言下的咸鱼了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位博主写道：老刘被傅首尔逼着奋斗，哪个全职太太经历过？老刘成为傅首尔段子素材，哪个全职太太经历过？老刘需要向傅首尔报账，有几个全职太太经历过？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这话确实不尽然，例如某些段子手也会拿自己的老婆“开刀”，但总体而言，老刘的经历的确是“全职丈夫”们的真实遭遇。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;多年前，一位老熟人，便因为要照顾孩子而辞去工作，成为全职“家庭妇男”。虽然他在与我们一起饮酒的时候，说起过那些可以拥有大把自由时间的快意，但骨子里，他越来越无法忍受连要零花钱、买衣服都要看老婆脸色的生活。这和老刘想买喜欢的衣服却因傅首尔不喜欢，因而生生被掐灭期待的案例，是同一回事。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所有令人愕然的细节，都不是凭空出现、无所指向的。不客气地说，老刘也好，一些“家庭主男”也罢，都失去了老婆的尊重，被嫌弃，成了一种生活里的常态。难以想象，这种不被理解和尊重的日子能持续多久。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;老刘的吐槽，被一些人不理解，认为这是矫情，闲出来的毛病。可若要将身份调换一下——丈夫对全职太太各种嫌弃和限制，那许多人还不炸了锅？此外，若是全职太太抱怨自己压力大，常被同情，可你看看，老刘的苦衷表现出来后，很多人却在指责他身在福中不知福，不懂得体谅辛辛苦苦在外打拼的傅首尔。这多么双标啊。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;全职太太和全职丈夫的差别客观存在。简单地说，全职太太更受包容，而全职丈夫很不受包容。这种性质，已经超越了一个家庭的范畴。那位老熟人面对的压力，不止于老婆一方，还源于周围人的奇异目光。一些网友在点评傅首尔和老刘闹离婚事件时也提起过种种辛酸，例如，任你如何解释做全职丈夫具有怎样的“不可抗力”，你依旧可能被人视为“吃软饭的”。试问女人有被鄙夷为“吃软饭的”吗？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当传统社会观念已经将男人塑造成为“养家者、家庭责任承担者”时，在某些人眼中，男人回归家庭，就是不可饶恕的。这就证明，男人其实是缺乏成为全职丈夫的舆论环境的。如果一不小心做了，那也得有所改变。我认识的一个男同胞，便在失业多日全靠老婆养家后，打起了零工，钱赚得不多，依然被老婆看不上，但至少他可以在邻居面前“腰杆子挺直了一些”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;都说婚姻以爱情为基础，婚姻何尝不是以尊重为基础？一来，如果男人确实需要做全职丈夫，那前提必须是能够得到家人与社会的尊重。既然女性做全职太太是一种工作，男性做全职丈夫当然也是一种工作。他不应被打上“吃软饭”“被施舍”的标签。二来，既然男人不能吃软饭的观念依然固化，那么一个男人就要想清楚，自己的选择妥不妥，今后能不能承受由此带来的压力，是否还有比自己做全职丈夫更优的选项？现实是残酷的，当因为自己的“全职”之选造成夫妻关系的微妙化甚至矛盾慢慢凸显，能否坦然承受不美好甚至一地鸡毛的后果呢？ &lt;/p>;

There are only fluctuations of heat waves.&quot; Director Wanma wrote in the novel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before arriving in Tibet, I had interviewed many members of the Everest scientific expedition team. One night, I was sitting and chatting with a geographer on the playground of Lanzhou University. He told a thrilling story about the scientific expedition on Mount Everest: a strong man with severe altitude sickness was lifted off a relay from an altitude of 6,300 meters. He got lost in the dark, snow fell on Mount Everest, and dangers arose one after another. He talked about the accident on the plateau, and I added: Wanma Tseden also died on the plateau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Geographers were surprised that director Wanma passed away in May. At that time, they were conducting scientific research on Mount Everest and there was no signal. He had seen Wanma&#39;s movies and said that director Wanma was a good person and he filmed ordinary people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wanma and the new wave of Tibet he led are the window for many people to understand Tibetan life and culture.

The road is mostly smooth, with occasional bumps. This 5,476-kilometer-long ordinary road has a large altitude difference. Sometimes it spirals between hard mountains, and sometimes it rises in &quot;trough-shaped geologically broken sections&quot;. National Highway 318 was originally the Sichuan-Tibet Highway built from 1950 to 1954. Thirty thousand People&#39;s Liberation Army troops entered Tibet to build the road and more than 3,000 people died. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the entrance of Mount Everest National Park, tourists lined up to take photos with the large-scale &quot;318 National Highway must be driven in this life&quot; ground painting. I was in a daze, and after searching on my mobile phone, I confirmed that the end point of National Highway 318 is indeed not at Mount Everest, but at the China-Nepal Friendship Bridge in Nyalam County, Shigatse. That night, at the tourist base camp at 5,200 meters in the Everest National Park, people sang loudly, sometimes &quot;March of the Volunteers&quot; and sometimes &quot;Broad Sea and Sky&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/W8spSjGms58H9uY0nGIVUg5Og01ZHiIg3bNMO8iV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1795&quot; height= &quot;686&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/W8spSjGms58H9uY0nGIVUg5Og01ZHiIg3bNMO8iV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251354&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A dead donkey on the side of National Highway 349&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Dashi/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After entering the national park, you will see the famous &quot;Everest 108 Turns&quot;. The asphalt road winds and climbs 800 meters, overlooking four snow-capped peaks above 8,000 meters. Due to the wide span and large drop of Turn 108, aerial photography has been mostly done here in recent years. But Dashi is an old-school photographer and has little interest in drone aerial photography. He likes his Fujifilm camera, which has a wide-angle fixed focus and can shoot 108-degree continuous undulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We settled at the Everest Station of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The webmaster wanted to take us to a good place, saying it was the best angle to photograph Mount Everest: from the high point of Rongbuk Monastery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rongbuk Monastery is the highest temple in the world. Its full name is &quot;Latucha Rongbuk Dong Aquling Monastery&quot;. It was founded in 1899 by the Red Sect Lama Ngawang Tenzin Norbu.

Monks and nuns from the Himalayas are accepted to study. At its peak, the Rongbuk Temple had more than a dozen affiliated temples, some of which were still in Nepal, but were later destroyed due to historical reasons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rongbuk Temple is named after Rongbukou. Under the north slope of Mount Everest, there is a north-south Rongbuk ditch, which was washed by the Rongbuk River. The Rongbuk River is formed by partial meltwater from the East Rongbuk Glacier, the Middle Rongbuk Glacier, and the West Rongbuk Glacier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/ysgmjcberZRv1P54zGkbT6jEbttPiggpyvG3n1Le.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2542&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/ysgmjcberZRv1P54zGkbT6jEbttPiggpyvG3n1Le.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251356&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Greening project along the national highway&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter&#39;s meal/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Whether it is scientific research or mountaineering, you need to walk through the East Rongbuk Glacier to enter Mount Everest. In 1921, when the legendary mountaineer Mallory tried to scout out a climbing route to Mount Everest, he missed the intersection of the East Rongbuk Glacier. But one of their team members discovered the East Rongbuk route. Since then, all climbing teams climbing Mount Everest from the north slope have taken this route. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/LuDSe8HweSQog5rP9TkaRw4lfOmc8e1SKPgzAzdm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2519&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/LuDSe8HweSQog5rP9TkaRw4lfOmc8e1SKPgzAzdm.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251359&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The &quot;108 Turns&quot; leading to Mount Everest&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Dashi/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;In the mouths of Western mountaineers, the road along the East Rongbuk Glacier to the advance camp is called the &quot;miracle highway.&quot; The scientific expedition team members of the Northwest Institute of Ecological Environment and Resources of the Chinese Academy of Sciences were quite surprised by this name. They had walked it several times and always called it the &quot;Yak Trail.&quot; This road is easy for yaks and people to walk on. It only takes 5 hours at a fast pace and 10 hours at a slower pace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Mallory missed the East Rongbuk Glacier, he took a precious photo of the Middle Rongbuk Glacier. During the 2023 Mount Everest scientific expedition, the Northwest Research Institute found Mallory&#39;s photo spot after three efforts. By comparing two photos spanning a century, they estimated that the Zhongrongbuk Glacier has retreated 4 kilometers from the past, or an average of 40 meters per year. The continued warming of the global climate will inevitably intensify the retreat of glaciers. In the event of an avalanche, excess melted snow will form a torrent and rush towards the mountain villa at the foot of Mount Everest. In the past 20 years, flash floods caused by avalanches on Mount Everest have washed away many Nepali villages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/Ppbwun05bkWz2O9tFNqnLd1Ov4tJoq8if0MEI2FY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2599&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/Ppbwun05bkWz2O9tFNqnLd1Ov4tJoq8if0MEI2FY.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251358&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The lady raised her fluttering silk scarf into the wind&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Dashi/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;This is the starting point of this trip, an observation of global climate change centered on the scientific expedition to Mount Everest.

Between the mountains, the Nu River, Lancang River and Jinsha River flow side by side in three canyons with a horizontal distance of only more than 60 kilometers. Under the sunlight, they look like yellow veins. When the plane landed slowly, I saw Shangri-La in the green valley like a spilled palette, flowing beside the Napa Sea wetland. The flowing cloud shadows are reflected on the water surface of the wetland, which is like a dream. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Lwz0dAOvw8iuPEN7OTb46QFWpvHn8s5f7SkFxZ2r.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;577&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Lwz0dAOvw8iuPEN7OTb46QFWpvHn8s5f7SkFxZ2r.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252052&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Napahai Wetland&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The center of Shangri-La City is An ancient city named &quot;Dukezong&quot; was originally built by the Tubo people and means &quot;Moonlight City&quot; in Tibetan. Since its construction, it has been abandoned and rebuilt several times, and its organizational structure, zoning and name have been changed several times, but its status as the political, economic and cultural center of Diqing, Yunnan has remained unchanged. For thousands of years, this place has witnessed not only the smoke of wars, but also the bustle of tea and horse trade. It has also been the link between Yunnan, Sichuan, and Tibet&#39;s &quot;Grand Triangle&quot; and a channel for frequent exchanges among various ethnic groups. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2014, an unexpected fire partially burned down the ancient city of Dukezong. Today, the ancient city has slowly recovered. Strolling along the stone road in the ancient city, you will see wooden houses on both sides, operating inns, restaurants, bars or handicraft shops. It reminds people of the &quot;quaint little town&quot; described by the British botanist Kingdon Ward. In 1913, in order to investigate the rivers and plants in the Hengduan Mountains, Kingdon Ward passed by this place and stayed in a house. He found that &quot;the house was extremely clean, and the copper cooking pots and tea utensils were polished to a discernible shine.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kindon Ward was not the only one to leave written records for Shangri-La. Liu Manqing, the first &quot;female imperial envoy&quot; to Tibet in modern times and known as the &quot;Fantastic Woman of the East&quot;, wrote about the ancient city of Dukezong in a delicate way in &quot;The Campaign of Kangzang&quot; published in 1933:&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;When the sky dawns or the sun sets, the streets are full of people carrying water. The ladles for collecting water are made of folded bark. They are light in weight and large in capacity. , beside the spring, water seekers swarmed like ants.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, at the foot of Dagui Mountain, the spring mentioned by Liu Manqing is still gurgling. Someone placed a water ladle next to the spring for passers-by to get water and taste it. The sun passes through the transparent water, and the waves dance under the water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since ancient times, Shangri-La has been a legend on the Tea Horse Road. At that time, there were more than 190 businesses traveling between Shangri-La and Lhasa alone, and more than 20,000 caravan horses passed through each year. In the alley of Dukezong Ancient City, I met the handsome Kham man Zhabagdan. Zhabagdan&#39;s father is from Shangri-La and was a member of a caravan when he was young. In 1970, Zhabagdan was born in a small mountain village in India. He worked as a monk for seven years. When he was seventeen, he returned to his hometown with his father. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhabagdan’s life legend begins in Shangri-La. After returning to China, he started studying in the first grade of primary school and later studied in Austria and the United States. He speaks Tibetan, English and Hindi, as well as a curry-flavored version of Mandarin. He has worked part-time as a civil servant, a tour guide, and opened a travel agency and restaurant. In 2012, Zhabagdan created the first &quot;Arokangba&quot; B&amp;B in the ancient city of Dukezong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Aruo Kamba&quot; is a sentence used by our fathers to greet each other while walking on the Ancient Tea Horse Road, which means &quot;Come on, friend&quot;. Creating &quot;Aro Kamba&quot; was not only Zhabagdan&#39;s father&#39;s dream during his lifetime, but also his own dream. Back then, the caravans walked on the Tea-Horse Ancient Road. Whenever they were exhausted, they would get a chance to rest in &quot;Naicang&quot; deep in the mountains. Every time my father mentioned the story of the caravan to Zhabagdan, he would always talk about the &quot;Naicang&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fire in 2014 severely damaged the ancient city. Although Arokamba Manor survived, the memory left by the fire in Zhabagdan has never faded. He still clearly remembered the shops and houses shrouded in fire, falling tragically like defenseless giants. The sound of explosions of liquefied gas tanks came one after another, and clouds of fireworks rolled up. The flying fragments hit the broken walls and made various sharp sounds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This was like a one-sided war. We were caught off guard in the face of the rapid fire.&quot; Zhabagdan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What makes Zhabagdan happy is that over the years, through the reconstruction of &quot;building the new as the old, replacing the old with the old, and imitating the old with the new&quot;, the ancient city of Dukezong has gradually restored its original appearance. What was once a devastated place has been replaced by a brand new look. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Stone streets, unique Tibetan inns, handicraft shops with ethnic colors, cafes and bars full of literary and artistic atmosphere, indicate that the ancient Dukezong city is back.&quot;&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;For Shangri-La, Zhabagdan has always had love and confidence. He still often thinks of the time when he and his father climbed over a pass and saw Shangri-La for the first time: &quot;That was a scroll painting that appeared countless times in my dreams.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/sbYkZP7IVmGI7grn25WnatoRXqkht9E7KSjwkhxB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;/ /images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/sbYkZP7IVmGI7grn25WnatoRXqkht9E7KSjwkhxB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252051&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center ;&quot;>;Songzanlin Temple&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Shangri-La is the imagination of the whole world&quot;&lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After leaving Shangri-La, we headed towards Deqin along the Yunnan-Tibet Line and stayed overnight in Benzilan Town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Benzilan is located on the right bank of the upper reaches of the Jinsha River. It means &quot;little sand dam&quot; in Tibetan. It is a valley area between the surging Jinsha River and steep mountains. However, as the altitude decreases, the scenery of the valley becomes desolate: gravel and barren soil on both sides, and exposed rocks. Just now, you could still see tall broad-leaved forests, a lush scene, but gradually they turned into low shrubs and cacti. The wind blew on my face, it was hot and dry, making me feel like I was in the desert of Mexico. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This &quot;hot and dry valley&quot; scene is a typical geological landscape in the &quot;Three Parallel Rivers&quot; area, and it can be called a wonderful stroke of nature: the warm and moist airflow becomes cold as it climbs over the mountains on both sides of the canyon in the wind. It triggers precipitation, so rainfall is frequent on the top of the mountain and vegetation is lush. The airflow descends through the leeward slope and becomes hot, and when it reaches the valley bottom, it becomes a dry and hot &quot;Foehn wind&quot;. The &quot;Foehn wind&quot; intensifies the degree of dry heat, causing the vegetation to become sparser, forming a &quot;hot dry valley&quot; landform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the &quot;Hot Dry Valley&quot; is by no means completely desolate. Through the car window, you can see ocher-colored mountains studded with agate-like terraces. By transforming these terraces, local people have created local environments suitable for farming. Walnuts, citrus, grapes, watermelons and olives are planted on the platform, complementing the tawny Jinsha River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After passing Benzilan Town, we left the road, followed the stream, passed through the valley, and arrived at the peaceful Bairen Village. Cacti grow among the exposed rocks, and pepper and plum trees grow along the roadside. The person I want to visit is Estelle Achard, a French female architect. Nine years ago, this French woman from the foot of the Alps sold her hut in northern France, came to this Tibetan village deep in the river valley alone, and opened an inn called &quot;Tulu Lodge&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Dirt Road&quot; was renovated from an old Tibetan-style house in the village, and the original appearance has been maintained as much as possible: plum trees and pomegranate trees are planted in the small yard surrounded by earth and stone walls. , rosemary and mint grow in stone flower beds. Estelle went out to greet us, followed by two dogs (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;One ​​of them is a blind dog&lt;/span>;), spinning around our feet excitedly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Estelle has ash-brown hair, glasses, and a Tibetan necklace hanging around her neck. Thirty years ago, when she was an architect, she came to Yunnan on a business trip for the first time and couldn&#39;t help but fall in love with the mountains and rivers here. Fifteen years later, she moved to Kunming. After working in hotel design for a few years, she moved to Shangri-La and finally settled in Benzilan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Estelle takes us through the rooms she designed and decorated one by one. Although each room has a different style, they all organically combine national characteristics with modern concepts, as if time has quietly settled here. When renovating the house, Estelle values ​​​​the most ecological and environmental protection concepts. She kept the wood as bare as possible and did not use chemical-based varnishes. She also deliberately preserved the &quot;dry toilet&quot; in rural areas: a hole was made in the ground of the toilet, a chair was placed above the hole, the seat was hollowed out, and there was a pile of sawdust under the hole, and the excrement fell directly into the sawdust and became Fertilizer for the vegetable patch outside the yard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having lived in Benzilan for nearly ten years, Estelle can communicate with the villagers in Chinese, and the villagers call her &quot;French Ajia&quot;. She likes local ghee, yak meat, and fresh vegetables and fruits, and she grows various herbs needed for French cuisine in the garden. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That night, we sat under the plum tree in the garden and shared a country dinner made by Estelle with a French family traveling to Diqing: tomato and watermelon cold soup, spice roasted chicken, mashed potatoes, served with Shangri-La products red wine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The corn leaves outside the courtyard swayed in the evening breeze, and the sound of the stream became louder. We talked about our respective experiences. Estelle said that she also thought about opening a B&amp;B in Provence, but Provence was already too saturated. She was very happy to settle down in Benzilan and open a small B&amp;B. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Provence is the imagination of the whole world, and it is the same here.&quot; Estelle said, &quot;Whenever I tell my French friends that I have settled in Shangri-La, they will exclaim!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Q1PcGm7rADXzIUj537SZW8Xgt8f84vX66AiWDkEi.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data -src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Q1PcGm7rADXzIUj537SZW8Xgt8f84vX66AiWDkEi.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252056&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Jinsha River Big Bend&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liu Zichao/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Xueshan Market Dunshiyang&quot; &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Early the next morning, we left Benzilan, left the dry and hot valley, and walked along the Jinsha River. The elevation of the road rises again, and the vegetation on the mountains becomes lush again. At the big bend of the Jinsha River, I saw the yellow river water turning around, like a man&#39;s bent arms, full of power - the mountains sandwiching the river water were like the guardian angel of the river. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is 86 kilometers from Benzilan to Deqin County. Although the mountain road is winding, it is in good condition. Before liberation, there were no roads in Deqin County, and it was not until 1959 that the Yunnan-Tibet Highway was built. At that time, it was necessary to climb the Baima Snow Mountain, which is more than 4,000 meters above sea level. From October to May of the following year, traffic was often blocked due to heavy snowfall. Now that the tunnel has been opened, it is no longer necessary to cross the pass of Baima Snow Mountain. Our car seemed to be gliding on the road, surrounded by dense forests on both sides. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The town of Deqin County used to be called Adunzi. It is said that during the Song and Yuan Dynasties, the eminent Tibetan Buddhist monk Karmapa discovered during meditation that Kawagbo, the main peak of Meili Snow Mountain, was the holy land of Chakrasamvara predicted by Padmasambhava. This started the pilgrimage of Tibetan Buddhists to Kawagebo. the first of its kind. Adunzi is not only the starting point and the end point of worshiping the sacred mountain, but also an important material distribution center and cultural exchange center on the Tea Horse Road. Therefore, it has the reputation of &quot;Snow Mountain Market&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a broader perspective, Adunzi is located in the contact zone between the Han and Tibetan peoples. As scholars say, just as Zhangjiakou&#39;s commercial development is due to its location in the contact zone between the Han and Mongolian peoples, Adunzi&#39;s commercial development is also due to the same reason. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the Anti-Japanese War, traditional international trade routes were blocked, and merchants gathered in Adunzi, which became a bridge to maintain Sino-Indian trade and transport war preparation materials. Due to the large number of major business houses, in order to facilitate transactions, merchants used a &quot;Dunshiyang&quot; currency as a medium of circulation. This kind of currency can only be used in Adunzi market, which shows the prosperity of Adunzi in those days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, Deqin has restored the appearance of a small mountain town, with buildings winding down the valley, with a drop of nearly 600 meters. Walking on the street, I can&#39;t see the prosperous scene of the Tea Horse Station back then. It looks more like an ordinary mountain city. Only the skin color of passers-by, their accents, and the attire of some residents made me realize that I was in a minority area inhabited by Tibetans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to its location in a narrow ravine, the biggest risk faced by Deqin County in recent years is mudslides. In 2003, the Diqing Prefecture government considered moving the county seat elsewhere. In 2010, a mudslide occurred in Zhouqu County, Gansu Province, which has similar terrain, which aroused people&#39;s concerns about Deqin. But local people told me that the mountains near Deqin are undulating, and it is very difficult to find a piece of flat land that is open enough. Therefore, the government’s latest consideration is to relocate the entire county seat to the adjacent Weixi County. If this is the case, the ancient city of Adunzi will also will become a piece of history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/DkyjOuuGVwfs4clUEE2QKRrwezqYeWvqNdy8pplL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/DkyjOuuGVwfs4clUEE2QKRrwezqYeWvqNdy8pplL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252053&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Kawagbo, the main peak of Meili Snow Mountain, and the Mingyong Glacier flows below the snow peak. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Mingyong Glacier is protected by Mingyong Village&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;In the early morning, we went to Feilai Temple to watch the sacred scene of &quot;Rizhao Jinshan&quot; - the golden sunshine hitting the Kawagebo Mountain Peak. Then we returned to Deqin County and met the poet Tashi Nyima in a Tibetan restaurant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tashi Nyima was born in Mingyong Village under the jurisdiction of Deqin County. This village is located under the Kawagebo Snow Peak, which means &quot;mirror&quot; in Tibetan. It is named after the huge glacier pouring down from the snow-capped mountains behind the village. In addition to Mingyong Glacier, Mingyong Village is also the place where the late poet Ma Hua taught. There, Ma Hua wrote the collection of poems &quot;Snow Mountain Short Songs&quot;, which was praised by critics as the clearest and clearest part of contemporary Chinese poetry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After lunch, I asked Tashi Nyima to take me to Mingyong Village. We got in the car and got on National Highway 214, and soon saw the roaring Lancang River. The landscape here is also a dry and hot valley, but I found that wherever there are terraces and slopes, there are pastoral houses, and you can see the waves of wheat rolling and the fragrance of melons and fruits. Driving on this road, you will see oases and residential houses embedded in the landscape drawn by snow-capped mountains, canyons and rivers, which is refreshing and refreshing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Along the way, in the passes and fields on both sides of the river valley, you can see towering earthen watchtowers from time to time. Most of them are dilapidated and dilapidated, full of the vicissitudes of history. I asked Tashi Nyima, when were these watchtowers built? What is it used for? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tashi Nyima told me that due to the passage of time, even the locals have lost their memory of the watchtowers. Whether they were for the purpose of war or just a symbol of wealth and status, historians and archaeologists disagree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/p9243QxUuIDpc0hJ7oun65LznBcxdNO3VKSmFwf8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/p9243QxUuIDpc0hJ7oun65LznBcxdNO3VKSmFwf8.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252055&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tibetan village under Meili Snow Mountain&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Leading to Mingyong The road in the village was opened in April 1998. In the past, the only way to enter and exit Mingyong Village was by taking the path on the cliff. In Tashi Nyima’s memory, the sound of the Mingyong River was louder than it is now. He goes to school, a half-day walk and a zip line. During the summer vacation, he went to the mountains to herd sheep. When he was hungry, he roasted the matsutake mushrooms collected from the forest, sprinkled them with salt and chili, and ate them. Now it seems that all this is a &quot;rare experience in life.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, the life of the people in Mingyong Village was very difficult. In most families, the whole family sleeps on the same bunk, and there are not even extra bowls at home. Zhaxinima remembers that when he was in junior high school, he once went home for a vacation and invited his classmates to have lunch at home. Since there were no guest bowls at home, he had to use a family member&#39;s bowl, which was only deformed - his father once went up the mountain to chop wood and fell, causing the wooden bowl to become deformed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After graduating from junior high school, Tashi Nyima went to a normal school to study, and then moved around villages and towns under the jurisdiction of Deqin County. In 1997, he was transferred to the Deqin County Tourism Bureau and participated in the preparation of the development plan for the Meili Snow Mountain Ecological Tourism Zone. It was that plan that made Mingyong Glacier a priority scenic spot for development, and the great changes in Mingyong Village began at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the government&#39;s vigorous promotion, Kawagebo Peak and Mingyong Glacier have begun to attract more and more tourists. Deqin County seized the opportunity and invested more than 70 million yuan to build infrastructure for Mingyong Village. Mingyong Glacier became the first national 4A-level scenic spot in Deqing Prefecture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the glacier tourism development, the villagers of Mingyong Village are mainly involved in providing horse-drawn services for tourists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Mules and horses have become the money bag of Mingyong Village.” Zhaxinima said, “In 1999, the average income from horse pulling was 8,700 yuan per household; by 2006, the average income per household exceeded We paid 50,000 yuan.&quot; The villagers have become rich in the tourism industry, and every household has purchased satellite TV, refrigerators, washing machines, and high-end stereos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, the county proposed the implementation of the glacier cableway project. Because the cost of raising mules and horses is not small, building a ropeway may bring more tourists. The villagers believe that by signing a contract with the ropeway company and negotiating a share of the profits, they can earn money comfortably without having to worry about feeding the mules and horses and safety issues. Since the Glacier Cableway was put into operation, each villager household has been able to receive at least 55,000 yuan in dividends every year. Mingyong Village has changed from a poor village in the past to a wealthy village in Deqin County and even Diqing Prefecture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/28wqjxJHLY65YACM1aD5eZvh0cGqRmvFrKmzkn7e.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/28wqjxJHLY65YACM1aD5eZvh0cGqRmvFrKmzkn7e.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252054&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Deqin Yubeng Village&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the afternoon, I and I Walking with Tashi Nyima in Mingyong Village. I saw that every household had built a two-story Tibetan-style house with a yard, and the white walls were dotted among the green forests and fields. Kawagebo Peak is right in front of you, and the glacier extends from the chest of the main peak to the forest at an altitude of 2,660 meters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tashi Nyima told me that according to the old people in Mingyong Village, you could see the glacier and feel the cool air of the glacier when you opened the window. At that time, the glaciers were very &quot;strong&quot; and filled the valley, and you could hear the loud noise of the glaciers cracking all day long. In 1913, the British botanist King Dun Ward also visited the Mingyong Glacier and saw &quot;a huge icicle shaking like a drunkard, roaring and rolling down the valley in an instant, startling a group of green parrots on the tree.&quot; rise&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tashi Nyima said that when he was a child, the outlet of the glacier would be blocked by falling ice, and the river would suddenly stop flowing. Village women would go to the edge of the glacier and raise their voices. Sing &quot;Mani Tune&quot;. As they sang, the ice cubes were broken open and the river water surged out. However, the glaciers have gradually receded over the years, which makes Tashi Nyima feel heavy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Every time I return to the village, I feel that the glacier has become smaller.” Zasinima said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To this end, he also filmed a documentary called &quot;Glacier&quot;, which expressed the Tibetan people&#39;s belief in the snow-capped mountains and their influence on foreign culture from three perspectives: pilgrims, tourists, and villagers. Different understandings, and the various confusions they face in the wave of tourism development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/S3QpLt5MKOUgTjgGiunNeUQ3OTyxymWfgcs0sdcy.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/S3QpLt5MKOUgTjgGiunNeUQ3OTyxymWfgcs0sdcy.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252057&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In the Shangri-La region, peach blossoms bloom under the snow-capped mountains.

He graduated from the International Politics Department of Fudan University in Shanghai. In March 2003, he went to Mingyong Village Primary School to teach on a voluntary basis. Unfortunately, he died on June 20, 2004, at the age of 32. &quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;Zhaxinima and Ma Hua were of the same age and both were poets, and they quickly became friends. When he returned to Mingyong Village to visit Ma Hua, the two often talked about books and music together. Ma Hua would pick up the guitar and sing folk songs, his long hair like a black waterfall. They went to a nearby mountain for a picnic and lay under an old peach tree that was unknown how old it was. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The breeze blows from time to time, and the petals fall down one after another along the warm sunshine. Behind the scenes are the Kawagbo Snow Mountain and the huge glaciers stretching down from the snow-capped mountains that appear and disappear in the clouds and mist. The glaciers glow blue and faint under the sunlight. Occasionally, the roar of ice avalanches can be heard, covering both sides of the valley. Looking at the dense forest, above the head is the intoxicating blue sky and the ever-changing clouds in the sky. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;——&quot;Under the Snow Line&quot; by Zasinima 》&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, standing in front of the Mingyong Primary School, the past is still vivid in my mind.

There are also many people who are eager to travel and use third-party platforms&#39; &quot;Light Speed ​​Ticket Grabbing&quot; and &quot;Ticket Grabbing Magic Tool&quot;. Tickets usually cost extra. In this regard, Railway 12306 issued a statement through its official Weibo, stating that it has never authorized any third-party platform to sell train tickets, and it is impossible to give third-party platforms the so-called &quot;priority to purchase tickets.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The statement said: &quot;Third-party platforms will retain user information during the ticket purchase process of passengers and friends. Not only are there traps such as surcharges, acceleration packages, bundled sales services, etc., but there may also be risks of personal information leakage. Please Passengers must purchase tickets through official railway channels, look for the railway 12306 website (including the client), and pay attention to protecting legitimate rights and interests and the security of personal information.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to understand the true meaning of this statement? Will &quot;ticket-grabbing tools&quot; lose their market? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, we must understand why for many years, it is difficult to get a ticket for high-speed rail on many lines during long holidays. But first, starting from this year, the shortage of tickets on some lines may change. And turn down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The use intensity of high-speed rail passengers on different lines is different. Some lines are more popular, with constant demand for commuting, business travel, tourism, etc., and there are many trains every day, such as between cities in the Pearl River Delta or Yangtze River Delta regions. There are lines between major urban agglomerations, as well as lines to popular attractions; some lines are not so popular and have relatively few flights. During the long holidays, in order to cope with the surge in travel demand, the high-speed rail will open some additional trains. However, it is obvious that the former will increase the absolute demand and relative demand much more, but the potential for additional operations is limited; the latter has great potential for additional operations, but the increase demand is limited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, for a long time, most high-speed rail lines have had the same price during normal times and long holidays, which often leads to the following consequences: when demand is low during normal times, the fare is higher than the market equilibrium price; during long holidays When demand increases sharply, ticket prices are significantly lower than the market equilibrium price, causing tickets to sell out as soon as they are released. The National Railway is well aware of this situation, so it is also making improvements to make fares more market-oriented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2020, the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway began to implement floating fares. The highest second-class fare for the entire journey was 598 yuan, an increase of 8%; the lowest fare was 498 yuan, a decrease of 10%, that is, the upper limit was increased. , the lower limit is lowered, which is the first time in the nine years since the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway was opened that a floating fare mechanism has been implemented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Starting from May 30, 2023, the railway department will conduct &quot;fare inspections&quot; on many high-speed rail lines such as the Shanghai-Nanjing Intercity, Nanjing-Hangzhou High-speed Railway, Nan-Guangzhou High-speed Railway, Jiaoji Passenger Line, and Liunan Passenger Line. &quot;Optimization adjustment&quot;, the upper limit is the published fare, the lower limit is 34% of the published fare, the upper limit is further increased, the lower limit is lowered, and the floating range is further relaxed. Taking the Shanghai-Nanjing Intercity as an example, the published fare for second-class seats from Nanjing Station to Shanghai Station is 166 yuan, which is the highest fare after adjustment, an increase of 19% from the pre-adjusted fare of 139.5 yuan; the lowest fare is 110 yuan. The fare dropped by 21% from the 139.5 yuan before adjustment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to raising and floating the fare caps on some popular lines, the railway department has also launched discount tickets. China Railway Guangzhou Bureau Group announced that &quot;in order to facilitate intercity passengers&#39; business travel and commuting travel&quot;, starting from June 20, 2023, the Changsha-Zhuzhou-Tanzhou Intercity Railway will officially launch regular tickets and time-counted tickets. Passengers can Take the S-shaped train running on the route at the designated departure station. Take the 60-time/30-day regular ticket from Chengdu East to Chongqing West priced at 5,852 yuan, which is equivalent to 97.5 yuan per time, which is close to the lowest operating fare for ordinary tickets, with a discount of up to 52%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The general trend is that the pricing strategy of high-speed rail is in line with that of airplanes. Unless there is an emergency, as long as you buy a ticket some time in advance, you can basically buy a ticket, and even the price is very favorable. This is because the air ticket will be set at a high &quot;original price&quot;, which is much higher than the market equilibrium most of the time. The price does not go up, but only goes down, with discounts of 30% or 40% off, giving passengers a sense of gain. This is a pricing strategy that is purely market-oriented and accurately grasps the psychology of passengers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The pricing strategy of high-speed trains is completely copied from that of air tickets. Starting from September 15th, high-speed trains will go on sale during the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holidays. When purchasing tickets, many people found that compared with normal times, some high-speed trains and trains and trains increased significantly during the National Day holiday. A passenger posted on social media that a dormitory ticket from Beijing to Shenzhen only costs 1,150 yuan on weekdays, but on September 28 the upper berth price increased to 1,860 yuan and the lower berth price increased to 2,090 yuan. On the same day, the lowest direct fare from Beijing to Shenzhen is 1,100 yuan (excluding tax). On the official website, the published fare for Beijing to Shenzhen is 2,264 yuan, with discounts of 1,860 yuan and 2,090 yuan, approximately 12% off and 92% off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, floating fares are not yet implemented on all lines. If you cannot get tickets during the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, it only means that the fares are still low relative to demand. For this line Either fixed fares are still being implemented, or floating fares are not in place. This is the explanation from economics. And this means that the &quot;ticket-grabbing artifact&quot; still has room for survival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The essence of &quot;ticket grabbing artifacts&quot; is digital scalpers. When the official price of a commodity is significantly lower than the market equilibrium price, the price difference is &quot;unowned income&quot;, and many people are motivated to compete for this. In terms of income, scalpers are one of them. Those who are diligent and queue up early to earn hard money, and those who have the skills to get insider tickets will share the income with insiders. Digital scalpers are also scalpers, but if a third-party platform claims to have &quot;priority to purchase tickets&quot;, it is a lie. If you buy an acceleration package, they will help you buy tickets at 12306. In this sense, clarification from the railways is necessary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, using algorithms and apps to grab tickets is definitely faster than hand speed. This is the market niche of the “ticket grabbing artifact”. The railway department&#39;s clarification cannot persuade passengers who are eager to return home and are eager to get tickets.

At the World Swimming Championships two months ago, Wang Shun failed to enter the finals in any of the three competitions he signed up for, leaving him far behind his peak form. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 24, in the preliminaries of the Asian Games, Wang Shunyou clocked 1:58.84, which was still far behind his 11th place finish at the World Championships (1:57.97).

He followed his father to the swimming pool for the first time. When he saw his father jumping into the pool, he jumped in immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The body sank and he was scrambling to grab something. Wang Shun quickly choked on the water, but he didn’t feel scared. “I didn’t feel like I was choking on the water and wanted to stay away from it. Instead, I wanted to To conquer it. Perhaps, I have a natural affinity for water. In the water, I feel unprecedented happiness and relaxation, and I feel like a fish in the water.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Shun&#39;s past achievements are indeed marked by the feeling of being like a fish in the water. : Born in Ningbo, Zhejiang in 1994. In 2007, he was selected by coach Zhu Zhigen and entered the first team of Zhejiang Province. In 2009, he followed coach Zhu Zhigen and entered the second team of the Chinese swimming team. In the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games, he became the runner-up in the men&#39;s 200-meter individual medley; in 2016 In 2021, he won the men&#39;s 200-meter individual medley at the FINA Short Course Swimming World Championships and won China&#39;s first world championship in men&#39;s medley; on July 30, 2021, he won the men&#39;s 200-meter individual medley championship at the Tokyo Olympics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in water, it’s not always possible to go downstream. After winning the Tokyo Olympics, Wang Shun lost his goal and felt that he could no longer get happiness from swimming. Raising the national flag and playing the national anthem at the Olympic Games has been Wang Shun&#39;s ultimate goal in his sports career of more than 20 years. He has long said, &quot;Athletes must have clear goals.&quot; From national champion to world champion, and then to Olympic champion, he has improved his competitive performance step by step. &quot;I always encourage myself to achieve good results.&quot; It&#39;s hard won, it&#39;s all step by step.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/94Qa5dmkdhAtqoULhnGmN0ILcfn9fI6ezA4wBl7K.jpg&quot; border =&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/94Qa5dmkdhAtqoULhnGmN0ILcfn9fI6ezA4wBl7K.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252116&quot; >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 24, 2023, Chinese player Wang Shun (right) shook hands with teammate Qin Haiyang after the game&lt;span style=&quot; color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the cheers, there was confusion without a goal. Looking back at the glorious moments in the past, Wang Shun said: &quot;Olympic championship has always been the ultimate goal pursued by all athletes. Before winning the Olympic championship, it took me more than 20 years to establish this goal and work unswervingly towards it. Let&#39;s go. After winning the championship, I found that the goal had dissipated and all the sources of motivation would disappear. I had to set new goals again, which was more difficult. I spent a year to re-establish the goals and then go Hit the peak.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;July 2023, World Swimming Championships in Fukuoka, Japan. Wang Shun feels that he has regained his motivation, hoping to forget the halo of the Olympic champion, continue to surpass himself, and fill the last gap in his gold medal Grand Slam (Olympic Games, Asian Games, Short Course World Championships and Long Pond World Championships) - Long Pond World Championships Tournament champion. However, Wang Shun ranked 16th in the men&#39;s 200-meter medley preliminaries of this competition and was almost eliminated; he ranked 11th in the semi-finals and missed the finals. In the 400-meter medley, he was disqualified due to a foul. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is Wang Shun okay? Such questions come from the outside world and from his heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The interval from the Fukuoka World Championships to the Hangzhou Asian Games was less than two months, and Wang Shun has been adjusting his condition. He is 29 years old this year and this is his fourth time participating in the Asian Games. At the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games, Wang Shun was still a newcomer. It was the first time he stood on the stage of the Asian Games and competed in the same swimming pool with his Asian opponents. Looking back today, he is &quot;still full of enthusiasm.&quot; But Wang Shun is no longer just a passionate novice. He has reached his peak, experienced ups and downs over a long period of time, and finally chose to jump into the swimming pool again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/YyS7jrnSTVUFm4UEWNKEYfmq7BgIQNYuhlpP1dXn.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;619&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/YyS7jrnSTVUFm4UEWNKEYfmq7BgIQNYuhlpP1dXn.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252115&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 24, 2023, in the men&#39;s 200-meter individual medley final of the Hangzhou Asian Games swimming competition held at the Hangzhou Olympic Sports Center Natatorium in Zhejiang Province, Chinese player Wang Shun won 1 point Winning the championship with a time of 54.62 seconds &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;He has to look at it carefully&lt;/span>; strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Wang Shun was still a child when he first faced the choice of swimming pool. At that time, he was studying painting and doing well, and at the same time he received an olive branch from the swimming team. Should he choose to become a professional swimmer? There was no such precedent in his family. It was instinctive and risky, so he chose the swimming pool. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Swimming has always given me a sense of progress.” As an adult, Wang Shun explained his choice this way. When time passed long enough, he experienced and felt more and more the other side of swimming: boring, repetitive, and self-confrontation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Swim in the 50-meter-long, 25-meter-wide swimming pool with 8 lanes, and take the trouble to go back and forth between the starting point and the end point again and again. He said: &quot;Swimming is a relatively boring sport. During competition and daily training, you rarely communicate with others. The only thing you can hear is the water sliding towards you, and the sound flowing through your ears is the most intimate thing for me. partners.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Shun once accidentally said in an interview that for 7 months in 2022, he would train at the base, just like building blocks. Every day he would start with basic training and train in one class. The class swims 13,000-16,000 meters, and sometimes there are two or three training classes in a row, including reaching the edge, turning around, rolling, and returning, and a complete set of water movements are repeated in a cycle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;His hands looked thin, with sharp knuckles, but rough calluses formed on the palms. During the first two years of training, the skin on his hands would wrinkle from being soaked in water for too long. Over time, the body gradually adapts, and &quot;the apparent reaction is basically gone.&quot; Long-term, fixed training also changed his daily routine. &quot;When I was on vacation, I was fine one day, but if I didn&#39;t go to the swimming pool the next day, I would feel uncomfortable all over. As long as I get to the swimming pool, I will feel very comfortable. Now I have such an emotion towards water.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;In addition to physical training, facing one&#39;s own heart is also a required course in this track. At the 2019 World Championships, Wang Shun was very eager to win a gold medal, but he did not even perform at his normal level. At the Military World Games three months later, Wang Shun&#39;s desire remained unabated, &quot;I must prove myself.&quot; He desperately increased the difficulty of training, but as a result, his lungs ruptured and he developed a pneumothorax due to excessive training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The treatment plan given by the doctor at that time was to inhale oxygen for one hour a day, but he hoped to recover as soon as possible and bring glory to the country, so he started to inhale oxygen for two hours a day. Even so, the doctor still recommended that he give up the game and rest for a week. He refused. After lying in bed for five days, he returned to the training ground and tried his best in the next day&#39;s game to win the championship. Now when he recalls the situation at that time, he still feels sad: &quot;There are many things that you may not be able to see. To me, it&#39;s like risking your life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images. infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/AsLCsDTbaqPmWKVQyOVCdRSQGVkZkCEk6QA32Xzx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;774&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/ medias/image/23/09/25/AsLCsDTbaqPmWKVQyOVCdRSQGVkZkCEk6QA32Xzx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252113&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;September 23, 2023 , the opening ceremony of the Hangzhou Asian Games, torchbearer Wang Shun and digital torchbearers jointly lit the main torch &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that The peak moment is the Tokyo Olympics.

Winning the championship is not the end. Walking off the podium, Everything starts from scratch, see you in Paris...&quot; From the bronze medal in Rio to the gold medal in Tokyo, Wang Shun described the feeling as &quot;indescribable.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I want to look at it carefully,” Wang Shun said. The gold medal is very heavy, which is a recognition of himself for so many years. It, what I am for - it is for it that I keep fighting. I feel that it is much heavier than I imagined. Although everyone only sees a gold medal, my life is included in it.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;After the peak, he experienced a trough, and at the Hangzhou Asian Games, Wang Shun once again proved himself with a fuller mentality. In an interview after the game, when asked if it exceeded expectations, Wang Shun said, &quot;It exceeded expectations. It was expected to be within 56 seconds, but I didn&#39;t expect that it would break the Asian record today.&quot; A reporter joked, &quot;Did the ignition yesterday give you strength?&quot; &quot; Wang Shun replied: It was the elders in my hometown who gave me strength. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just the night before winning the championship, on September 23, at the opening ceremony of the Hangzhou Asian Games, Wang Shun and the &quot;Digital Human Torchbearers&quot; lit the main torch of the Asian Games together.

(MCN Organization), used scripts, staged shots, etc. to incubate &quot;Liangshan Mengyang&quot; (Axi Moumou, female) with more than three million fans on the short video platform. Yi nationality, 21 years old), and &quot;Liangshan Aze&quot; (A&#39;s certain, male, Yi nationality, 21 years old).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a previous report by &quot;China News Weekly&quot;, some fans went there out of sympathy in 2019 Jiqu Village, Bier Town, Zhaojue County, where &quot;Liangshan Mengyang&quot; is located, discovered that the place where Mengyang often shoots videos is actually a place where local farmers raise cattle and sheep, and Mengyang&#39;s family background is not bad, and he is considered wealthy in the village . Meng Yang dropped out of school early and worked in Guangdong. Villagers believe that Meng Yang’s fortune is inseparable from “meeting a good boss.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liangshan Prefecture Police stated that the above-mentioned illegal and criminal acts are well-organized and confusing. The case is strong and involves a wide range of areas, forming a gray industrial chain of counterfeiting and selling in recent years, including front-end creation of characters, incubation of Internet celebrities, mid-end script shooting, e-commerce operations, end-end supply of agricultural products, and traffic realization.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Why are these MCN institutions so keen on &quot;mining gold&quot; in Daliang Mountain?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Huilin, a senior practitioner of agricultural products e-commerce, analyzed that Daliang Mountain is a natural reservoir of products and traffic. First of all, Daliang Mountain&#39;s The products have become popular among Internet celebrities; secondly, the topic of Daliang Mountain caters to traffic, “Daliang Mountain has ethnic minorities, beautiful scenery, and rich cultural heritage. People are rare for these few things, which solves the biggest traffic problem. &quot; Wang Huilin told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;The economic development of Daliang Mountain is relatively slower than that of coastal areas, and with the attribute of helping farmers, this matter will develop more logically. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only Daliang Mountain, but also Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, places with “products, scenery, people, and culture” are sought after.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nong Ge believes: &quot;It&#39;s more credible to shoot there. There must be a choice. Why doesn&#39;t anyone choose to go to Zhejiang to help farmers? &quot;According to his many years of experience in carrying goods in the countryside, many short video bloggers like Meng Yang are suspected of exaggerating the misery of the countryside.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A farmer practitioner from a mountainous area in the north told Southern Weekend reporter, people always have a prejudice against mountainous areas. In fact, including the business environment, some local things may be better than those in developed cities, but these have no attention and traffic. &quot;There is no electricity in mountainous areas in xx&quot;, this topic is With traffic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Supporting farmers has become the focus of short video platforms. On September 12, the first &quot;Kuaishou Light Chasing Conference&quot; announced the launch of Kuaishou Village Broadcasting &quot;Stars Project&quot;, which will be launched in the next three years. Invest 10 billion traffic and 50 million cash to cultivate 1 million village broadcasters and 1,000 rural entrepreneurs, and provide talents to 160 key national assistance counties. On September 21, Douyin E-commerce released the &quot;2023 Harvest Festival Douyin E-commerce&quot; &quot;Agricultural Assistance Data Report&quot;, the number of short videos of trailers selling agricultural products on Douyin e-commerce is 21.86 million, and the total time of explaining agricultural products in the live broadcast room is 37.78 million hours. Fujian, Henan, Yunnan, Anhui and Sichuan have become the agricultural products on the platform. Businesses originate from the top five provinces.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liangshan Prefecture Police released the script of the MCN agency’s agriculture and rural areas video, which includes “collecting mountain goods”. For example, Shiyi and her cousin went to local villagers with scales, bags, backpacks, etc. Collect mountain goods at home.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The script of rural areas and farmers caters to the traffic algorithm of short video platforms in disguise. Nie Wenchang, chairman of an e-commerce group in Shandong, established one of the first live broadcast bases in Linyi. He told Southern Weekend reporters Analysis, &quot;The popularity will be high after the script is written. It is done according to some rules of the platform to boost the popularity. &quot; He said that the theme of rural life has broad resonance.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Huilin believes that the reason why these videos are popular is that they trigger the platform&#39;s mechanism, &quot;data feedback, not human feedback.&quot; Data indicators determine this If it is a &quot;good&quot; video, more traffic will be injected. Judging from the logic of the platform, the speed of fans accumulation of Daliangshan Internet celebrities is normal.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Huilin told Southern Weekend reporters that these scripts There is a lack of normal life logic, and the routines are not new, but short videos are often driven by emotions and do not need to think about logic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the Daliangshan internet celebrity incident, Southern Weekend reporters called several farmers-helping culture The phone calls of media companies may not be connected, or they may remain silent.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;It looks like helping farmers, but it is actually selling goods&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Using false personas to attract people After becoming fans, the above-mentioned companies will open online stores and live broadcast to sell goods. Under the banners of &quot;helping farmers&quot; and &quot;high-quality original ecology&quot;, they purchase honey, walnuts and other agricultural and sideline products at low prices from foreign food companies, and pass them off as &quot;Daliangshan specialty agricultural products&quot; Trademarks were passed off as inferior and fake as genuine and sold across the country. According to the police, the company where &quot;Liangshan Mengyang&quot; works also hired Internet trolls to create the illusion of popular products and orders in the live broadcast room, inducing consumers to buy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meng Yang once shouted excitedly in the live broadcast room, &quot;You gave me the money for gifts, and you bought walnuts, which is equivalent to supporting many uncles, aunts and ordinary people here, you know? &quot;In fact, only a very small amount of the agricultural products brought by the above-mentioned companies come from the local area, and most of them are purchased from other places at low prices.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nong Ge does not agree with this way of helping farmers. He has been selling it for several years Agricultural products, he has always called himself a &quot;dealer&quot;. &quot;Most people easily believe it when they tell us how pitiful we are in front of the camera and use other people&#39;s kindness to make money.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Shengfan&#39;s analysis, false personas, fictitious origins, etc. The situation has constituted the category of false advertising, and once false advertising is involved, the anchor and the MCN organization where he works may be required to bear three different legal liabilities: criminal, civil, and administrative if there is any conscious intention.&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;Even if the products are indeed from the place of origin, selling them by fabricating stories and creating personas may be illegal. Feng Shengfan told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;Although the origin of the products is real, consumers are based on the stories and characters made up by the anchors. Assuming that only those who are willing to place an order have sympathy for helping farmers. Therefore, the anchor’s fabrication of stories and creation of characters also constitutes a misleading way of fabricating, fabricating, and distorting facts in false propaganda. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Odikebu, the village secretary of Gumo Village, said, “Our Gumo Village is such a small place and we don’t get so much honey. He is a liar and has not helped. Don&#39;t recognize him! ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relevant people from Xinxuan Group, a live broadcast e-commerce company, told Southern Weekend reporters that some places have problems with unsalable agricultural products and have fewer distribution channels. The public welfare agricultural assistance project aims to help local areas open up sales and drive employment, Help revitalize. Compared with other categories, agricultural products are more prone to problems, have low profit margins, and require a large investment of manpower and resources.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Compared with leading companies, the quality of local supply chains is uneven. Wang Huilin introduced that a common model in the industry is that the Internet celebrity company finds a suitable local supply chain, negotiates cooperation, and establishes links through short video platforms.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Southern Weekend reporters, Internet celebrities live broadcast to draw goods The commission for agricultural products is generally about 20%, and the commission for higher products can be as high as 30%.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some of the products carried by Daliangshan Internet celebrities come from the supply chain of Pujiang County, Chengdu. Wang Huilin reminded that this It does not mean that the goods of these supply chain companies do not come from Daliang Mountain. Perhaps to save logistics costs, &quot;Hami melons in Xinjiang may be shipped from Xi&#39;an.&quot; According to Liangshan Prefecture Police, the Liangshan Internet celebrity who was imprisoned chose The supply chain does not actually get goods from Daliangshan.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another common model is for supply chain companies to cultivate and discover Internet celebrities. &quot;China News Weekly&quot; revealed that many Liangshan Internet celebrities He once cooperated with supply chain supplier Ren Yanbing to sell his products. Southern Weekend reporters contacted Ren Yanbing as a collaborator. He said, &quot;This business is not easy to do, and I am ready to change my career.&quot; This supplier was not affected by the Liangshan Internet celebrity. The impact of the incident.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nie Wenchang said that compared with other categories, agricultural products are special. The quality of agricultural products in the hands of farmers varies, and even if consumers get agricultural products from other places, it is difficult to distinguish the authenticity from the fake.&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;Nowadays, the illegal behavior of some Internet celebrities has had a negative impact on Daliangshan specialties. Faced with doubts, some sellers have to make special explanations. A store that specializes in selling pure oatmeal flour from Daliangshan farmers has its business qualifications But it was shown in Panlong District, Kunming City, Yunnan Province. The anchor explained that the store was opened by fans, but the shipping address was his home. Another store claiming to sell ugly apples from Daliang Mountain in Sichuan has its business address in Haikou City, Hainan Province. The merchant explained in the live broadcast room that this was the address registered when selling pineapples in Hainan. He took out his mobile phone and asked &quot;Hi, Siri, what is the current altitude?&quot; Siri gave an answer of 2515 meters.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(At the request of the interviewee, Nong Ge remains anonymous)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div >;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt; a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 18:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国家医保局：半年追回“救命钱”63.4亿]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257625]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/25/oJQaF1ux6W8TBXvy8GF7pGHv9ricnuyACau5xl3g.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1270&quot; height=&quot;950&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/oJQaF1ux6W8TBXvy8GF7pGHv9ricnuyACau5xl3 g. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252110&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The 2023 National Medical Insurance Fund unannounced inspection has officially started in late August, focusing on medical imaging Examination, clinical examination, and rehabilitation are three areas where problems reported by the public are relatively concentrated. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Medical insurance funds are the &quot;life-saving money&quot; for citizens to seek medical treatment.

Those who wantonly publish abuses and insults against individuals on the Internet Cyber ​​violence that spreads rumors, defamation, invades privacy and other information must be subject to due legal sanctions. On September 25, the Supreme People&#39;s Court, the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, and the Ministry of Public Security jointly held a press conference to officially release the &quot;Guiding Opinions on Punishing Internet Violence and Crime According to the Law.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Opinions&quot; have a total of 20 articles, mainly covering ten aspects:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, clarify the applicable rules for the crime of online violence. The &quot;Opinions&quot; provide guidance on the nature of online violence in accordance with the criminal law and relevant judicial interpretations. Specifically, those who openly insult others or fabricate facts to slander others on the information network, if the circumstances are serious, will be convicted and punished for the crimes of insult and slander; organize &quot;human flesh searches&quot; to illegally collect and release citizens&#39; personal information to an unspecified majority of people, and the circumstances are In serious cases, they will be convicted and punished for the crime of infringing on citizens&#39; personal information. In addition, the crime of illegal use of information network can be applied to malicious marketing and hype behaviors carried out through cyber violence incidents; the crime of refusing to perform information network security management obligations can be applied to the behavior of failing to perform information network security management obligations in accordance with the law for discovered cyber violence information . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is to clarify the rules for handling illegal online violence. For online violence, we should adhere to multi-dimensional and joint governance and improve the connection mechanism between administrative law enforcement and criminal justice. The &quot;Opinions&quot; stipulate that the implementation of online insults, slander and other online violence does not constitute a crime. If it complies with the provisions of the Public Security Management Punishment Law and other provisions, administrative penalties will be imposed in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third is to clarify the policy principles for punishing cyber violence crimes. The &quot;Opinions&quot; require that the spirit of severe punishment for cyber violence crimes should be reflected so that the people can fully feel fairness and justice. Adhere to strict law enforcement and justice, strictly investigate cyber violence crimes in accordance with the law, and effectively correct the erroneous tendency of &quot;the law does not punish the public&quot;. We must focus on cracking down on malicious initiators, organizers, malicious promoters, and those who persist in reforming despite repeated abuses. The &quot;Opinions&quot; also stipulate that there are those who commit cyber violence against minors and disabled people, organize &quot;trolls&quot; and &quot;thugs&quot; to commit cyber violence, fabricate &quot;sexually related&quot; topics to infringe on the human dignity of others, and use &quot;deep synthesis&quot; and other generative methods If artificial intelligence technology releases illegal information, or if network service providers initiate or organize cyber violence, they will be severely punished in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fourth is to clarify the boundaries between illegal crimes and legal behaviors of online violence. The &quot;Opinions&quot; stipulate that reporting or exposing other people&#39;s crimes or violations of laws and disciplines through information networks should not be considered a defamation crime as long as they do not intentionally fabricate facts or knowingly spread the facts to be fabricated. Commenting and criticizing other people&#39;s words and deeds, even if the views are biased or the speech is extreme, as long as it is not wanton abuse or malicious slander, it should not be considered an insult or crime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fifth is to clarify the work requirements for public security organs to assist in evidence collection. According to the provisions of the Criminal Law, in cases where the victim files a private prosecution for online insult or defamation, if the people&#39;s court determines after review that it is indeed difficult for the victim to provide evidence, it may request the public security organs to provide assistance. The &quot;Opinions&quot; reiterate the provisions of the Criminal Law, and also clarify that the public security organs should promptly identify the perpetrators of online insults and slander according to the requirements of the People&#39;s Court and the specific circumstances of the case, and collect evidence and materials such as the spread and spread of relevant information and the impact caused. Network service providers shall provide necessary technical support and assistance for public security organs to obtain evidence in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sixth is to clarify the public prosecution standards for criminal cases of online insult and defamation. According to the provisions of the Criminal Law, those who commit crimes of insult or slander and seriously endanger social order and national interests shall be prosecuted in accordance with the law. The &quot;Opinions&quot; stipulate that in cases of online insult and defamation, public prosecution procedures will apply if one of the following circumstances occurs: (1) causing serious consequences such as mental disorder or suicide of the victim or his close relatives, and causing a bad impact on society; (2) arbitrarily using The general public is the target of infringement, and relevant information is widely disseminated on the Internet, triggering a large number of vulgar and malicious comments, seriously disrupting the order of the Internet, and having a bad impact on society; (3) Insulting and slandering multiple people or spreading insulting and slanderous information multiple times, causing social harm Those with a bad impact; (4) Organizing and instigating people to spread a large amount of insulting and slanderous information on multiple online platforms, with a bad impact on society; (5) Other situations that seriously endanger social order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The seventh is to clarify the transition process from private prosecution to public prosecution in criminal cases of online insult and defamation. The &quot;Opinions&quot; stipulate that for online insults and slander that seriously endanger social order, the public security organs have filed a case as a public prosecution case, and the victim simultaneously files a private prosecution in the People&#39;s Court, the People&#39;s Court may request the private prosecutor to withdraw the private prosecution or rule not to accept it; it has been accepted If the case is found, a ruling should be made to terminate the trial and the relevant materials should be transferred to the public security organs. The original private prosecutor can participate in the lawsuit as a victim. The victim files a private prosecution before the public security organ files a case. If, upon review, the people&#39;s court determines that the relevant online insults and defamation seriously endanger social order, the case shall be transferred to the public security organ. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eighth, support civil rights protection against online violence in accordance with the law. The &quot;Opinions&quot; stipulate that if cyber violence is committed against others and infringes on others&#39; reputation rights, privacy rights and other personality rights, and the victim requests the perpetrator to bear civil liability, the people&#39;s court will support it in accordance with the law. If the right holder has evidence to prove that the perpetrator is committing or is about to commit an illegal act that infringes upon his or her personality rights, and failure to stop it in time will cause irreparable damage to his or her legitimate rights and interests, the People&#39;s Court may, upon the right holder&#39;s application, issue an injunction against infringement of personality rights in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ninth is to clarify the rules for public interest litigation in cases of online violence. The &quot;Opinions&quot; stipulate that if online violence harms public interests, the People&#39;s Procuratorate may file a public interest litigation with the People&#39;s Court in accordance with the law. If a network service provider fails to perform its information network security management obligations in accordance with the law for discovered cyber violence information, resulting in the large-scale dissemination of illegal information or other serious circumstances that harm the public interest, the People&#39;s Procuratorate may file a public interest litigation with the People&#39;s Court in accordance with the law. When handling public interest litigation cases in the field of cyber violence control, the People&#39;s Procuratorate may require network service providers to provide necessary technical support and assistance in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The tenth is to proactively perform duties and promote comprehensive management of cyber violence. The &quot;Opinions&quot; require that when handling cases of cyber violence, information on the progress of the case should be released to the public in a timely manner in accordance with the law, clarify the truth, and eliminate the adverse effects of cyber violence, so as to reduce the harm to the victims and help the victims get out of their predicaments; carry out legal publicity and give full play to law enforcement The role of rule guidance, value orientation and behavioral norms in handling cases is to educate and guide netizens to consciously abide by the law and lead social civilization; to conduct in-depth analysis of the root causes that promote the occurrence of online violence, promote multi-dimensional co-governance of online violence, and fundamentally reduce online violence occurrence, creating a clear cyberspace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 15:55:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
