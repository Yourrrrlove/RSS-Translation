Currently, three people are trapped. The local government and fire department are doing their best to rescue them in the snow. Prior to this, this news had quickly become a hot topic across the Internet and attracted great public attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How many people were in the library at that time, how many students were among them, and what the casualties were are what the public is eager to know. According to the latest disclosure from the local government information office: at 0:35 on the 7th, the rescue at the accident site has been completed; when the accident occurred, there were 7 people on site, 3 of whom escaped on their own, 1 was slightly injured, and 3 were killed; the venue where the accident occurred It belongs to the New Sunshine Fitness Club in Huanan County, and the club leader has been controlled by the police. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what caused the stadium to collapse? According to CCTV reports, the gymnasium is a two-story frame structure with a construction area of ​​about 2,000 square meters. The collapsed location was the basketball area on the second floor on the west side, with the collapsed area of ​​about 500 square meters. Video posted online showed that the roof of a building collapsed. The four walls were intact. The building was about two stories high. The scene was covered with snow and wall fragments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The collapse of the gymnasium roof reminds people of the roof collapse of the No. 34 Middle School gymnasium in Qiqihar City in July this year. The accident killed 11 teachers and students of the school&#39;s women&#39;s volleyball team who were training in the gym. The cause of the collapse was that the construction unit illegally stacked perlite on the roof of the gymnasium. The perlite absorbed rainwater and gained weight, causing the roof load to increase and cause the collapse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The collapse of the Huanan County Gymnasium this time was also a roof collapse, which is similar to the collapse of the Qiqihar Gymnasium. Therefore, there are also voices pointing to the heavy snow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the blizzard red warning signal issued by the Jiamusi Meteorological Observatory at 17:30 on November 6, the cumulative snowfall in the city in 6 hours has reached 15 mm. The snowfall is expected to continue until the morning of the 7th, with accumulated snowfall in the process. The amount can reach 25-35 mm. The Huanan County Meteorological Observatory issued a red snow warning signal at 16:47 earlier: The snowfall in our county has reached more than 15 mm within 6 hours and the snowfall is still continuing. Please pay attention to precautions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The collapse of the No. 34 Middle School Gymnasium in Qiqihar City was related to rainfall. It rained frequently in the area for a period of time before the incident. Perlite can gain three times its weight after absorbing water, and the water is not easy to dissipate. After repeated rains, the weight of perlite will increase a lot. Moreover, these perlite building materials are not laid flat on the roof, but gathered in one place, which increases the pressure on part of the roof structure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The roof of the collapsed gymnasium in Huanan County was covered with snow. Judging from the video posted online, the snow on the ground is not too deep. Winter has just begun in the Northeast at this time, and there should be no snow before. The snow on the roof is mainly caused by this snowfall. Unlike rain, snow does not accumulate in one place, and the pressure is basically evenly distributed to the entire roof. Is 15 millimeters of snow enough to collapse the roof of a stadium? Converted into pressure, it is only 15 kilograms per square meter, or 147N/square meters. The standard live load value for roofs that are not accessible to people is 0.5kN/square meter (50 kilograms of force per square meter). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the No. 34 Middle School Gymnasium in Qiqihar City, which is an old building with a history of more than 30 years, according to media reports citing eyewitness reports, the collapsed gymnasium in Huanan County was a newly built urban complex in recent years. If the entire roof cannot withstand a pressure of 15 kgf/m², does its construction quality pass the standard? How did it pass the inspection in the first place? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that after the collapse of the No. 34 Middle School Gymnasium in Qiqihar City, Heilongjiang Province held an emergency video conference on production safety throughout the province that night and requested that the buildings of various schools and public welfare sports venues be quickly organized and inspected. Safety. According to the Hunan County Government website, on the afternoon of July 24, 2023, the day after the roof of the No. 34 Middle School Gymnasium in Qiqihar City collapsed, the Magistrate of Hunan County went to the Yuecheng Plaza National Fitness Gym to inspect the implementation of safety work. . Just over three months later, a very similar roof collapse accident occurred in this gymnasium, indicating that Huanan County was probably just a formality at that time and did not conduct serious safety inspections. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Four months before the collapse of the No. 34 Middle School gymnasium in Qiqihar City, the Qiqihar City Education Bureau also conducted a school building safety inspection. This safety inspection also failed to discover the serious safety hazard of a large amount of perlite piled on the roof of the stadium, which ultimately led to the tragedy. Although the cause of the accident was rainfall, it was also a man-made disaster. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The real cause of the roof collapse of the Huanan County Gymnasium has yet to be identified. But in any case, the roof collapse shows that the building safety inspection 3 months ago was definitely not in place. How many more of these superficial inspections, official business matters, and formalistic inspections are there? How many more lives must be paid in exchange for a true emphasis on safety? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This stadium easily passed the safety inspection 3 months ago. How to explain it? More importantly, this stadium is part of the Yuecheng Plaza urban comprehensive commercial complex built in 2018 as a local investment attraction project. The total construction area of ​​this complex is more than 110,000 square meters, including commercial, residential and supporting public buildings. If the construction quality of the stadium is so poor, are there any quality problems or safety hazards in other parts of the entire complex? This is a much bigger issue than the quality and safety of gymnasiums. It should be clarified what responsibilities the construction unit, supervision unit, developer and local regulatory authorities should bear respectively; it should also be clarified whether the person in charge of the club has any responsibility in this construction process, and the operator should not be allowed to take the blame for the entire incident. Xia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The public expects answers to these questions as soon as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 07 Nov 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[史国威：打破摄影与绘画的边界]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259929]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-07 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/01/xg0hnrzo0ZCiBuLzrU0BwZisyNWVwdgt8GSxiT6p.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;940&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/xg0hnrzo0ZCiBuLzrU0BwZisyNWVwd gt8GSxiT6p. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256520&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Jiang Xiaoming /Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Several cats are patrolling on the two-meter-long glass table. One is black, one is white, one is completely brown from behind, and one is hiding. I don&#39;t want to see anyone on the second floor, it&#39;s gray. They have accompanied the artist and traveled around with respect as guests for more than ten years. The studio has been demolished again and again, and now it has retreated to the edge of the city and rents a flight attendant dormitory near the Capital Airport. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The indoor space is getting smaller and smaller. When Shi Guowei is painting on the first floor, his cats stay on the second floor of the loft; sometimes even if he goes downstairs and jumps on the workbench, he still knows that he is always and at the same time. Keep a distance of one meter from the painting area. Looking at these aging pets is like witnessing an overly clear ending. After giving away several cats one after another, he no longer dared to raise new cats. Thinking of the scene of standing in front of the crematorium furnace again and again, he couldn&#39;t help showing a look of pain, &quot;My heart really couldn&#39;t bear it.&quot; He can only take things as they come. &quot;I don&#39;t dare to take them for a physical examination. They are all so old. If the problems are found, they must be treated. The energy, time, and expense are all beyond my reach.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;Had he known that he would have to face this kind of torture again and again, he might have chosen to bypass it in the beginning. It was 2006, and he had just returned from studying photography at the Dortmund University of Technology in Germany. Like many young people who were excited and trying to become artists at that time, he built a large studio in Heiqiao and posed for photos in the studio. After completion, photos of people, real outdoor scenes and objects with Chinese elements were collaged and combined following famous Western paintings, washed into a huge black and white photo nearly two meters wide, and finally hand-colored into a colorful painting. His father, who was in the bonsai business, sometimes came to see Shi Guowei and brought a litter of newborn stray cats from Laitai Flower Market, which was once the largest in Beijing. He couldn&#39;t bear to banish them, so he had to accept these brothers and sisters with different colors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A soft-hearted bachelor with nearly ten kittens (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;after giving birth to two litters, the female cat disappeared. was able to give up&lt;/span>;) and began his fashionable and ambiguous artistic career. He hired an intermediary to search for Russian models for him. They should not be curvy or beautiful, but should focus on ugliness and conflict. Venus is no longer a symbol of peace and tenderness. The fat naked girl has her eyes closed and is sleeping soundly. There are many weird plastic dolls beside her, and the Old Summer Palace is on fire in the background. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/f9uPJOCXa1XpSg5L8Ld0W0Sh05Qv0tIp47Rq4sKA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;692&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/f9uPJOCXa1XpSg5L8Ld0W0Sh05Qv0tIp47Rq4sKA.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256521&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Flowing Sunset&quot; 2023, laser silver salt on paper, liquid paint, 130cm×177cm, photo/courtesy of the artist and Magician Space&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hans· Holbein&#39;s &quot;Ambassadors&quot; has been transformed by Shi Guowei. The characters have changed from wool-clad nobles to blood-covered butchers. The astronomical observation equipment in the original work has been replaced with those from the 1960s and 1970s. Objects are thrown on a blood-red blanket, and a photographed Buddha head represents the skull at the bottom of the oil painting - neat irony and confrontation are ready to emerge in these works that combine photography and painting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By around 2010, this experienced boilermaker (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; had weak heating in his studio. In order to survive the long winter, The artists in Heiqiao wore black coats and shoveled coal constantly to prevent it from burning out. Their faces and hands were black every day. When the coal was weighed in their hands, they knew how much it cost per ton&lt;/span>;) They created nearly twenty visuals Powerful nude work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It takes a lot of time to color photos by hand. This method was first used in his master&#39;s degree graduation work. In order to graduate successfully in Germany, Shi Guowei thought for a long time and thought that he should make up for his lack of shooting hardware, The shortcomings in technology are highlighted while the strengths in art are highlighted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he was in college, he studied photography in the Graphic Visual Arts Communication Department of Tsinghua Academy of Fine Arts, but the courses for the first three years had no direct connection with photography. He trained in sketching, color, sculpture and other skills every day. I took basic sketching courses for two years and developed the same painting skills as an art student. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The creative method of photography and painting was determined. In terms of content conception, he still focused on the comparison between Eastern and Western cultures that he was busy with in the following years. He invited foreign models to wear Mulan costumes, and then asked Chinese models to wear Robin Hood costumes. He may be dressed like a pope, but his face is painted with Peking Opera facial makeup. &quot;This one is easier to operate, and you can use a large landline phone. At least the materials are better than others. After the black and white photo is developed, I will use hand coloring to paint it into color. In this way, it will stand out immediately. You and I All students are different.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/ie6zEu59X0Q9LUBcLXmXPMFJFaUZngiHbtNqhDUy.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;873&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/ie6zEu59X0Q9LUBcLXmXPMFJFaUZngiHbtNqhDUy.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256522&quot;>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Wool&quot; 2021, laser silver salt paper base, liquid paint, 180cm×198cm Image/Courtesy of the artist and Magician Space&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 >;&quot;Why is there always meat in my paintings? Is there blood?&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When he completed his graduation project, the one-meter-wide photo paper table could not fit on it, so he had to lie on the floor of the rental house and sketch with his hands. Holding two brushes, I used the fine brushwork and heavy color blending method I learned in technical secondary school, dipped a dab of dog tag paint sent from China, and immediately changed it to water to dye it evenly. I relied on these eight single photos to &quot;get ready for graduation.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Curator and critic Karen Smith once summed it up, &quot;He observed and recorded scenes, creating black-and-white photographs in the traditional photographic style, which he then painted by hand over a long period of time. This The process not only requires eye-hand coordination behind the camera lens, but also requires precise control of the way the brush is applied. After returning to China after studying at the Higher School of Photography in Dortmund, Germany, Shi Guowei gradually formed his own unchanging and compelling vision. The way of expression is a delicate and exquisite fusion between photography and painting. The combination of many materials and techniques also makes the work carry more connotations than the literal meaning of the label &#39;hand-colored photos&#39;.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;In the early days of his return to China, he recalled that the large amount of bloody violence and pornography in his works came from &quot;many years of repression in society. When he was studying in Germany, he spent most of his time working to make a living, and had no choice but to wash dishes in restaurants and go to restaurants. I worked the night shift in the factory carrying bags, doing the lowest level of work. Art and other things didn&#39;t matter to me. The first goal at that time was to have enough food to survive, and the second goal was to graduate as soon as possible so that I could have an explanation for my family. Yes. Only with this diploma can I make a living and do what I want to do.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The works from those years appeared in a number of exhibitions, large and small, but received little recognition. &quot;At that time, I wanted to do something related to the West, thinking that everyone could understand it, but in fact, through several exhibitions, I found that people didn&#39;t know what I was going to do, and they didn&#39;t know the source. Now it looks like I was there at that time I shouted as loud as I could and yelled very strongly, but it had no effect, so I might as well be quieter. If the treatment was superficial in the past, now it is internal injuries. Even if the treatment is calm, the Qigong has actually penetrated the body. It&#39;s through your body.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/Hxm6eYLC2cSPba4i9gtCjIUwz3t9kP9wVFjNhQ6A.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;795&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/Hxm6eYLC2cSPba4i9gtCjIUwz3t9kP9wVFjNhQ6A.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256524&quot;>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Roshan&quot; 2021, laser silver salt paper base, liquid pigment, 184cm×154cm&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（ (Photo courtesy of the artist and Magician Space)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since about 10 years ago, the content of his creations has undergone tremendous changes. &quot;I slowly changed because I started walking in the mountains and taking some photos related to nature. I felt more and wanted to return to myself. The previous works were all about society and other people, and exported some of my understanding of the outside world. I know, it has nothing to do with myself.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Shi Guowei first turned to nature, what he pursued was still the similarity of shapes. He painted very finely and obscurely meticulously. The grass itself is green. The painting is still green, but the degree of greenness may be slightly different compared to the color photo. What he hoped to hear at that time was the audience&#39;s perception when they took a quick look and said, &quot;Hey, isn&#39;t this a color photo?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, he has turned more and more inward. When he goes to Lingshan Mountain, he may only take one or two touching photos. In the solo exhibition at Magician Gallery in September 2023, some of the paintings are from his travels in Xinjiang, the Daxinganling and other places. He became more and more strict when selecting, &quot;You will wonder whether this scene is related to me, and whether it is worth it.&quot; .&quot; The traces of coverage are getting heavier and heavier, making it almost difficult to see the original appearance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rocks are painted with the texture of raw meat in his paintings. No matter how magnificent the scenery is, through his eyes, it is often transformed into a cruel product. The deaths of pets and relatives lingered in his mind. When he saw the wool piled up like a huge yurt, waiting for wool traders to come and buy it, dark brown, light brown and yellow were intertwined in the wind. The herdsmen were used to it, and he only felt cruel. ; Seeing an Ewenki hunter kill a deer in 20 minutes, he recalled how he handled hares alone after hunting with his father when he was a teenager (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hook The scene of putting on the doorframe, lifting the knife, and peeling the skin&lt;/span>;), &quot;It was familiar and uncomfortable at the time, so why is there always meat in my paintings? Is there blood? This kind of atmosphere is throughout, but now it is used It is more stable and not as bloody as the large area more than ten years ago.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of my wife, who is also doing art work, this dyed image is not a restoration, but more subjective than reality. , is doubt and dissatisfaction with the realistic picture. Coloring the fictitious landscape in reality means putting aside the training of restoring color cards and extreme precision in past photography classes, and completing denial and rebellion in &quot;turning a blind eye&quot;. He once said, &quot;Over the years, I have been trying relentlessly to break the boundaries between photography and painting, just like breaking a decaying wall. To be more precise, I am trying to keep myself free from the edge, like an acrobat walking on a tightrope. Maintain balance and never fall to any side, no matter photography or painting. Only in this way can I face the things around me more clearly and calmly, so that I don&#39;t get lost. Just like the edge of the river, there are always weeds that are fatter than elsewhere. , where the nutrients are the most abundant.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 07 Nov 2023 09:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[平均降价58%，​第九批国家药品集采41种药品采购成功]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260089]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-07 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On November 6, the ninth batch of state-organized centralized bulk procurement of drugs produced results in Shanghai. 41 types of drugs were successfully purchased in this centralized purchase. The average price of the selected drugs was reduced by 58%, and it is expected to save 18.2 billion yuan in drug costs every year. Pharmaceutical companies actively participated in this centralized procurement, with 382 products from 262 companies participating in the bidding. 266 products from 205 companies are eligible to be selected, including 260 products from 200 domestic pharmaceutical companies and 6 products from 5 international pharmaceutical companies (including 1 original research drug and 5 imported generic drugs). The winning rate is about 78%, with an average of 6.5 companies for each category planning to be selected. This centralized procurement has a high selection rate for enterprises, and has a good effect on reducing the burden on the masses, achieving a balance between the multiple goals of &quot;reducing burdens, promoting development, and ensuring supply.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This centralized purchase covers medications for common and chronic diseases such as infections, tumors, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, and mental illnesses, as well as key drugs such as emergency drugs and shortage drugs. Lenalidomide capsules for the treatment of multiple myeloma will be included in the centralized procurement in time after the patent expires in May 2023. The average price of each capsule (25 mg) has been reduced from about 200 yuan to 15 yuan, which can save about 3,880 yuan in monthly drug costs. Patients The burden is significantly reduced. The prices of three nationally focused drugs monitored for rational use, including rabeprazole oral sustained-release dosage form and esomeprazole magnesium enteric-coated dry suspension for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, have been significantly reduced. Five kinds of shortage drugs and emergency drugs, including amiodarone injection to treat arrhythmia, dopamine injection to rescue shock, and oxytocin injection to induce labor, have been used to stabilize corporate expectations through the &quot;volume-based&quot; procurement method to ensure supply and Balance of multiple objectives for reasonable price reduction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2018, the National Medical Insurance Administration has organized and carried out nine batches of nationally organized drug procurement, including a total of 374 kinds of drugs, with an average reduction of more than 50%. In the next step, the National Medical Insurance Administration will work with relevant departments to guide various localities and selected companies to implement the winning results to ensure that patients across the country can use the selected products after the price reduction of this centralized purchase in March 2024. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 07 Nov 2023 08:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“吃不完剩下点很正常”？节约习惯还得从小塑成丨养儿育女]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260019]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-06 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;As a working mother, I always believe that it is important to prepare a hearty, delicious and nutritious meal for my second-grade son every day. The rich and satisfying breakfast was indeed a &quot;big job&quot;. Recently, in the morning, I followed my child&#39;s request and packed breakfast for him at the bakery or community cafeteria downstairs. When I came home in the evening, I found that he always had more than half of a hamburger or rice ball left. I curiously asked him why he wasted some food every day, and he answered me nonchalantly: &quot;It&#39;s normal not to be able to finish the rest!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After listening to the child&#39;s words, I gave him a detailed calculation. An economic account: If he wastes 9 yuan a day, 63 yuan a week, and 252 yuan a month, he wastes more than 3,000 yuan a year. This money can buy a good mobile phone, a A branded washing machine can also cover the living expenses of a poor rural person for a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The child was extremely shocked by what he said. He sighed repeatedly, &quot;Mom, before you calculated this account for me, I never thought that if you waste a little bit every day, you would lose so much. I will ask you to buy less in the future, please remember it!&quot; Seeing the sincerity on his face, I couldn&#39;t help but sigh, modern children&#39;s awareness of thrift really needs to be cultivated from an early age! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is true that today’s favorable material living conditions can easily cause children to lack the concept of money. From childhood, when you open your mouth to eat or stretch out your hands when wearing clothes, if you open your mouth to ask for anything, parents will satisfy you without reservation. Some parents even feel that they suffered too much in childhood and have not experienced many fun in childhood, so they feel that they cannot be owed anything. child. Over time, mentally retarded children will no longer know where money comes from, let alone how difficult it is to make money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, wrong guidance from parents is also the main reason why children have no concept of money. With the development of modern technology, people tend to use mobile payment instead of cash payment. During e-commerce festivals such as &quot;6·18&quot; and &quot;Double 11&quot;, many parents &quot;buy, buy, buy&quot; regardless of whether it is useful or not. Behind the convenient and fast payment, children cannot feel what money is, and they will not ask &quot;how much money does my family have&quot; or &quot;how much money can my parents earn in a day&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, the limitations of school education methods are also an important reason for children&#39;s lack of money concepts and awareness of saving. I believe that all schools will warn children to develop the habit of thrifting from an early age, but it is obviously difficult to exert their due effect by admonishing and urging children. Of course, it is also difficult to arouse children&#39;s empathy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We all know that children are in a critical period of forming their outlook on life. Proper guidance from parents and schools is particularly important for them to develop correct values. Because of this, as parents, we must first guide our children to establish a correct concept of money. Use plain and easy language to calculate accounts for children, so that they can concretely understand the concept of money and truly feel that money is hard-won. You might as well prepare a piggy bank for your children, let them save money and use it by themselves, and warn them not to buy and spend randomly. Take your children to participate in some social labor, let them experience the hardship and fun of making money, and let them realize that making money is not easy during labor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teaching by words and deeds is worse than words and deeds. Parents are role models for children to follow. Good examples inspire people to make progress, but bad examples can cause endless harm. As parents, we ourselves must develop a good habit of saving, teach our children why we need to save and how to develop a good habit of saving in every aspect of our lives, tell them that money should be spent wisely, and then create a culture of spending money when it is appropriate and being thrifty and thrifty. family atmosphere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no doubt that school education and social guidance are also extremely important for children to develop thrifty habits. In school education, we carry out themed study activities such as &quot;Spend January with 100 Yuan&quot;, organize children to go to rural poverty-stricken areas to experience life and feel poverty, so that they can truly understand that making money is not easy and life is difficult, and encourage them to develop thrift. virtue. At the same time, mass media such as radio and television should also promote the &quot;new trend of frugality on the dining table&quot; and encourage everyone to promote traditional virtues. We can also encourage children from developed areas in the east to pair up and help each other with children from poor areas in the central and western regions, so that the &quot;little princesses&quot; and &quot;little princes&quot; living in honey pots can use their own actions to help children in poor areas realize their &quot;dream of going to school&quot; and &quot;seeking knowledge&quot; &quot;Dream&quot; to promote common growth and let the &quot;little princesses&quot; and &quot;little princes&quot; truly realize the great role of saving. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a civil servant in Quzhou, Zhejiang)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;span>; As a parent and teacher, share the scenery you have experienced and the principles you have learned on the way your children grow up.

Recently, some media published a report describing a female monster born in 1991. One day in July 2022, she severed ties with her relatives by deleting WeChat and blocking her phone number: List Including 3 cousins, 1 cousin, aunt, and parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The article stated that in 2022, she was fired from an Internet company in Suzhou. She suffered a cerebral infarction and a stroke the next day after drinking the break-up drink. She will need to take care of herself for at least a year. In addition to not drinking alcohol or eating high-fat foods, In addition to salty food, you also need to go to the hospital regularly to prescribe medicine, which requires a medical fee. Her parents divorced when she was 8 years old and each formed a new family. She grew up under the care of her grandmother and aunt, so she asked her closest aunt, but her aunt said it was &quot;inconvenient to bear&quot;; she also asked her father for help, hoping that every month Borrowing two to three thousand yuan from himself, her father said that he could only pay for her hospitalization expenses; she asked her mother for help, but her mother had no response. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many such reports in the media. For example, there is a report about the separation of relatives, which describes the 37-year-old Ye Wen. When he was a child, he was a left-behind child. His parents were working in Dongguan. He did not go to college. , works as a photography apprentice, opens a photography studio, likes literature, and writes worker poetry, but &quot;is not understood by his family or even his parents.&quot; He believes that his relationship with his father is broken by the word money. In 2019, he wanted to open a photography studio and borrowed 10,000 yuan from his father. His father did not speak. In his words, he was &quot;playing dead.&quot; He continued to ask: &quot;Do you want to borrow it or not? Let&#39;s talk.&quot; The father replied: &quot;I can&#39;t take care of your business.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above two cases of divorce are quite extreme. . There are two definitions or types of renunciation: one is (actively) severing contact with parents, family members and relatives, which is very clear; the other is the so-called &quot;lazy or negligent communication with relatives&quot;, which is also very clear. Vague, will be discussed further later. A common misunderstanding is to use extreme cases of the former to cover the latter, in order to exaggerate the breadth and severity of disconnection among young people. In fact, there are differences between the two situations and should be discussed separately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First discuss the above two cases and the first type of divorce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 32-year-old female Xiaoguai and the 37-year-old Ye Wen both had shortcomings in childhood: one was that her parents divorced and formed new families, and they did not raise her by their side; the other was a left-behind child when she was a child, and her parents It&#39;s pitiful that I can&#39;t be with you when I&#39;m busy working to make money. However, these two people have already grown up. As adults, how to view and deal with the relationship with their parents, family members and relatives should also be done in an adult way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are no more than two ways for adults: one is the modern way, where one is independent, has personal rights and dignity, and can take responsibility for oneself vs. other individuals who are equally independent and have boundaries; In the traditional way, everyone belongs to a big family or family, and blood is thicker than water, and family ties are important. Big families or families are natural blood communities, and have mutual financial and insurance functions. You can only choose one. Each method is equal. You will get what you pay for. No one can take anything and ask for it blindly. It cannot be said that I want all the advantages and disadvantages of both methods. That is extremely refined egoism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, Xiaoguai is 31 years old. Grandma and her aunt took care of and raised her after her parents divorced. This is not the aunt&#39;s duty, but a matter of affection. This is tradition and help from the extended family. After she became an adult, her aunt also had her own small family, and it was not unreasonable to &quot;not be able to bear&quot; her maintenance and medical expenses. Why did she have such high psychological expectations for her aunt? To have so much resentment and sever ties with my aunt after not meeting expectations? She must have been working for some years. Has she ever repaid her aunt for her kindness in raising her in the early years? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An adult who follows modern ways and does not expect to receive any help from his parents or extended family and does not maintain relationships with his parents, family members and relatives on a daily basis should be held responsible for his actions, e.g. After earning money, you should save money to prepare for emergencies; choose a healthy lifestyle and take care of your physical and mental health, because you have made up your mind to only rely on yourself. You cannot talk about personal freedom and independence when you are active and active. When you encounter trouble, you will think of your parents and extended family. In fact, after she opened her mouth to her father, he was willing to pay her hospitalization expenses as an adult and was kind to her. He just didn&#39;t meet her request to &quot;lend herself two to three thousand yuan a month.&quot; Why did she have to sever ties with her father? ? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similarly, in 2019, Ye Wen was 33 years old and borrowed 10,000 yuan from his father to open a photography studio. When his father refused to borrow the money, he severed the relationship with his father. This also caused a high psychological impact on his father. Expectations, and when expectations are not met, a lot of resentment arises. Speaking of modern methods, it is a matter of affection to be a father, but it is a duty not to be a father. In this sense, a father is the same as anyone else. If you borrow money from any friend, borrowing money from a friend is a matter of affection, but not borrowing money is a duty. Will you fall out because your friend refuses to borrow money? Doesn’t this confirm the correctness of not borrowing from friends? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, for the second type of severance, some people believe that the reason is that some young people no longer value &quot;blood relations&quot; and hate family gatherings with male elders as the core in a patriarchal society; the significance of progress It&#39;s very big, &quot;You can&#39;t choose relatives, but you can choose friends&quot;, which reflects the change from &quot;acquaintance society&quot; to &quot;stranger society&quot;. These arguments are all debatable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As mentioned above, the extended family or family is a natural blood community, which itself means that you are born with social capital (birthright). Why abandon it like worn out shoes? To a certain extent, trust based on blood and family ties is irreplaceable, and the maintenance cost of family ties is very low. If you are in the local area, you should visit regularly; if you are out of town, make a phone call or send a text message during the holidays to show yourself mind. In an era of peace and prosperity and when you are happy, these relationships may not be needed; but when facing difficulties and challenges, it is most reliable for family members to stay together and resist risks. Atomized individuals have poor ability to resist risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are two possibilities for &quot;being lazy and neglecting to interact with relatives&quot;. One is that you have essentially broken off the relationship. The problem is: you just don’t have to interact with relatives who are weird or have bad character, but you don’t have to essentially cut off contact with all relatives. Confucianism says &quot;cultivate one&#39;s moral character and bring order to one&#39;s family.&quot; People who have bad relationships with all their relatives may have problems themselves. If you are driving on the highway and find that all the cars are going the wrong way, there is only one truth: it is not others who are going the wrong way, but you. The other is just that you think so in your heart, and your parents still come forward to maintain the relationship for you while you are away from home for a long time. This is a false breakup. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can indeed choose friends, but close friends and life-and-death acquaintances are rare and require a high degree of spiritual and values ​​​​fit + deep trust established by long-term living and communication together. How many close friends, life and death friends, can a person have in a lifetime? What&#39;s more, there is no substitute for maintaining family relationships and making friends, and they can go hand in hand. Moreover, it may be difficult for those who have severed blood ties and family ties to establish deep connections and trust with people who are not even blood related, and it is also difficult for them to become trustworthy friends in the eyes of others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, the so-called &quot;stranger society&quot; does not mean to eliminate the &quot;acquaintance society&quot;, but the &quot;acquaintance society&quot; is embedded in the &quot;stranger society&quot;. The world you face is still a world with Different concentric circles, the center of the circle is yourself, and the small family and the big family wrap you up in turn. As for the term &quot;patriarchal society&quot;, it is a deconstruction of fathers, marriage and family (one of the cornerstones of civilization). Civilization domesticates men, makes them assume family responsibilities, provides resources and protection, and improves the survival ability of children. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 06 Nov 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[当“爱”已成往事]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260087]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-06 20:31:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;When a love affair turns into a marriage, a lawsuit will be filed.

This concept has been widely recognized in the scientific community, but in real life Whether people can maintain a healthy lifestyle affects people&#39;s actual physical and mental state. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, researchers from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and other institutions have studied the impact of a healthy lifestyle on people&#39;s lifespan by analyzing the genes and living habits of a large number of elderly people. It was found that people with healthy lifestyle habits tended to have a lower risk of death and longer life expectancy, even in later life. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Nature and nurture&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to data observed by the research institute, if elderly people with low genetic risk have relatively healthy lifestyle habits, they are expected to have The life expectancy may be 3.84 years longer than other people. If people with higher genetic risk have healthy living habits in their later years, the life expectancy can be 4.35 years longer. Relevant research will be published in &quot;The Lancet Healthy Longevity&quot; in October 2023. It can be seen that people with higher genetic risk benefit more by maintaining a healthy lifestyle, while those with high genetic risk but unhealthy lifestyle have the highest risk of death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Innate genetic factors and acquired social environmental factors are two basic variables that affect human health. Research on long-lived elderly people shows that the death risk of elderly people over 110 years old is relatively stable, and there is no significant correlation with genetics, living habits, age, gender and other factors. But for most people under the age of 110, genetics, age and a healthy lifestyle are all important factors that affect lifespan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on twin studies, it is estimated that about 25% of the difference in life span between people can be attributed to genetics. But in 2018, Columbia University scientist Yaniv Erlich and others analyzed the lifespan patterns of more than 10 million people through family trees and believed that the impact of genetics on lifespan may not be that great. Explains 16% of the difference, which is less than one-fifth. This shows that factors such as living environment and lifestyle may have a greater impact on people&#39;s life span. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, in order to comprehensively measure the impact of genetics, lifestyle and other factors on the life expectancy of the elderly, the latest research analyzed data from these two aspects at the same time. Relevant health data comes from the Chinese Health and Longevity Survey from 1998 to 2018, which recorded the conditions of more than 36,000 people over the age of 65. During the follow-up study period, a total of more than 27,000 people died. To compare the impact of life expectancy factors provide a reference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the definition of researchers, a healthy lifestyle generally includes four aspects, not smoking, not drinking excessively, regularly participating in physical activities, and maintaining a healthy diet. It is worth mentioning that the scope of sports activities is also very wide, not only regular exercise is recognized, but also housework, gardening, raising animals, playing cards and other activities are included in the statistics. Considering that the elderly are prone to protein deficiency, only a diet that contains high-protein foods such as meat, eggs, and fish will be defined as a healthy lifestyle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taken together with the health habits of these older adults and their longevity, the findings actually emphasize the importance of developing a healthy lifestyle. Even in old age, these habits may help increase life expectancy. However, due to limitations of the research design, the latest research cannot provide a scientific explanation of the mechanism behind this. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;It does not happen overnight&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;For the elderly, health and longevity are inseparable from a series of diseases. As aging intensifies, the incidence of many diseases, such as dementia, continues to increase. In 2022, a forecast study by the Global Burden of Disease Project estimates that the number of people suffering from dementia worldwide is likely to increase significantly from more than 57 million in 2019 to approximately 150 million in 2050, an increase of 166%. During this period, the number of sick people in China may increase from more than 15 million to more than 45 million, an increase of 197%, which is equivalent to a tripling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias are related to the cognitive ability and self-care ability of the elderly, they will not only affect the quality of life of the patients themselves and their families. Once they become lost or separated from care after the disease, It may also be life-threatening. In recent years, more and more studies have found that diseases such as dementia are also related to living habits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2023, researchers from the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Southern California used health data of nearly 50,000 elderly people to study the relationship between sedentary behavior and dementia, and found that the length of sitting is related to the onset of dementia. There is a clear link to risk, with longer periods of sitting associated with a higher risk of dementia. Compared with a median of 9.27 hours of sedentary behavior, those who sit for 12 hours a day have an increased risk of more than 60%, and if they sit for 15 hours a day, the risk more than triples. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;None of these elderly people were diagnosed with dementia at the beginning of the study. The average age was over 65 years old. They carried monitoring devices on their wrists and accurately recorded their sedentary time in subsequent years. Here, some people are diagnosed with dementia. But that doesn’t mean dementia is caused solely by sitting for long periods of time in old age. Existing scientific observations show that education, smoking, obesity, high blood sugar and other conditions may affect the risk of dementia. Lifestyle factors associated with geriatric disease can be traced back to younger ages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, psychology researchers at the University of Sussex used an observational study lasting nearly thirty years to explore the long-term health effects of symptoms such as depression and found that if people accumulate If there are too many symptoms of depression, anxiety, etc., cognitive functions will be more damaged in middle-aged and elderly people, such as poorer memory and lower accuracy of information processing. This evidence means that the relationship between some diseases may be interlocking and can induce other diseases decades apart. Not only should early detection, early intervention and early treatment be required, but also the development of healthy lifestyles should be early. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, for depression, scientists have discovered that there is a causal relationship between a healthy lifestyle and this type of disease. If you adhere to a healthy lifestyle, reduce sitting for long periods of time, increase social activities, exercise regularly, do not smoke, drink less alcohol, and maintain a healthy diet and sleep, it will help prevent depression. Research on older people has also found that developing even a hobby can help reduce people&#39;s symptoms of depression and improve their happiness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mental health diseases such as dementia and depression are just one case that affects people’s health and longevity. In reality, there are many diseases that affect people’s health. Although the pathogenic mechanisms of various diseases are mostly complex, existing Scientific evidence shows that lifestyle factors are at work behind a considerable number of diseases. In other words, by changing your lifestyle, it is possible to reduce the risk of disease and even death. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The Brutal Truth&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The latest research released by the Global Cardiovascular Risk Alliance shows that more than 50% of cardiovascular disease cases and about 20% of all-cause The deaths can be attributed to five modifiable risk factors. The five risk factors are: body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, non-HDL cholesterol, smoking and diabetes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Specifically, about 57% of cardiovascular disease cases and 22% of various death cases among women are affected by these five risk indicators, and about 53% of men are affected. % and 19%, relevant research was published in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; (NEJM) in October 2023. Modifiable risk factors serve as weather vanes. Abnormalities in a single indicator will not suddenly cause disease or death, but they can give people time to identify disease risks early and make changes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Body mass index (BMI), which can measure body fat and thinness, has been widely used in health management and disease risk prediction. Overweight and even obesity are obvious risk signals. Blood pressure and cholesterol are usually items that can be checked during a physical examination. Smoking is harmful to health, and quitting smoking as early as possible can greatly reduce the risk of disease. As for diabetes, as an important risk predictor of other cardiovascular diseases, it is a chronic disease in itself. Preventing and controlling blood sugar levels as early as possible requires developing many healthy lifestyles and persisting for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Concerning health and longevity, in recent years there have been some scientific opinions that do not seem serious enough, such as &quot;people with higher incomes live longer&quot;, &quot;people who love art live longer&quot;, etc.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, behind They all point to the issue of lifestyle affecting life span. Although these economic, social, and cultural factors, such as diet, hobbies, etc., are simple, common, and even interesting, scientific proof shows that they can all be used as environmental factors that affect life span and affect human health together with genes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, artistic hobbies affect lifespan, probably because these cultural and sports activities not only exercise the body, but also activate the brain. They also provide opportunities for social interaction, improve people&#39;s sense of happiness and belonging, and reduce It relieves loneliness, which is very rare for the elderly. An epidemiological study in Norway found that people who regularly participate in singing, dancing and other artistic activities will reduce the risk of death by more than 40%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for those with higher incomes and longer lives, the relevant evidence is more abundant, and it also confirms the widespread influence of factors such as economic and social status. Public health studies in the United States, Norway and other places have found that the life expectancy of people in the top 1% of income levels is nearly 10 years longer than those in the bottom 1%. In societies with different welfare systems and varying degrees of inequality, economic factors play surprisingly similar roles. It is a cruel truth that people with high incomes can live longer. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Developing good habits as early as possible&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is actually related to a series of healthy lifestyles. From the perspective of basic material conditions such as diet and housing, healthy diet and high-quality living environment are often more expensive and require higher income support. Medical care, services closely related to health and lifespan, and physical exercise facilities also rely on economic basis. In addition, education, income, health awareness, etc. are often related. People with higher incomes may be more aware of the importance of health, understand more health knowledge, increase exercise, and smoke less, drink less, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When these healthy lifestyles are concentrated in cities, comparative data show that people living in big cities tend to live longer overall, including low-income groups living in big cities. . Although the income is not high, they may benefit from the overall public health services, policies and health culture of large cities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the secret of longevity, the scientific community has never stopped exploring. In recent years, some preliminary findings in some animal experiments are actually related to lifestyle. Researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center observed hundreds of mice for nearly four years, the equivalent of a lifetime. In 2022, their nearly four-year study showed that dietary patterns can change the lifespan of mice, specifically reflected in the amount of food and the time of eating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Restricting 30% of the caloric intake can extend the lifespan of mice by 10%. If the caloric intake time is further restricted and eating during normal activity times according to the circadian rhythm, the lifespan can even be extended by 35%. This provides a reference for humans to understand the mechanism of longevity, and also proves the importance of a healthy lifestyle to a certain extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it should be noted that it is difficult to grasp all the information about a person’s daily life in various current studies on healthy life, especially when observing diseases and life span through the lifestyle of large-scale groups. There are many limitations, and more research is needed in the future to uncover the secrets of health and longevity. In view of the fact that some healthy behaviors also have a positive impact on people&#39;s current lives, such as regular exercise, healthy eating, and smoking and alcohol control, these recognized daily healthy behaviors are worth developing as early as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 06 Nov 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[猪心脏移植手术再次失败了]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260084]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-06 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On September 22, 2023, the University of Maryland Medical Center announced that the medical Doctors at the center transplanted a heart from a genetically modified pig into a 58-year-old heart disease patient two days ago.

However, the latest news shows that the patient died on October 30 and did not survive longer than the first patient to receive a pig heart xenograft. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/06/fOu2F2QHapWf3QcyXUdPXmBWyk4ZdOwhI4tqYzHC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1216&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/06/fOu2F2QHapWf3QcyXUdPXmBWyk4ZdOwhI4tqYzHC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257207&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The University of Maryland Medical Center recently performed the world&#39;s second pig heart xenotransplantation. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(University of Maryland Medical Center/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Immune rejection remains the biggest threat&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;The pig heart transplanted this time came from a genetically modified pig and was provided by Revivicor, an innovative biotechnology company specializing in the cultivation of donor pigs for xenogeneic organ transplantation. It is a subsidiary of United Therapeutics Corporation. of subsidiaries. This genetically modified pig involves a total of 10 gene modifications. The main purpose is to &quot;disguise&quot; pig organs as human organs so that the human immune system cannot distinguish them, thereby reducing the body&#39;s immune rejection of foreign organs. Three of the genes were &quot;knocked out,&quot; or inactivated, to eliminate alpha galactose from the pig cells, a sugar that triggers a severe reaction in the body&#39;s immune system, leading to organ rejection. In addition, six human genes were introduced into the pig genome to improve acceptance by the human immune system, and another pig gene that controls the growth of the pig heart was modified to prevent the pig heart from continuing to overgrow after transplantation into a human. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The recipient of this xenogeneic organ transplant is 58-year-old Lawrence Faucette. According to a University of Maryland Medical Center news release, the patient had advanced heart disease and complications from peripheral vascular disease and internal bleeding that precluded a traditional heart transplant. On September 14, Fawcett was admitted to the University of Maryland Medical Center due to heart failure. Without a pig heart transplant, the patient&#39;s life may be in danger at any time. With the informed consent of the patient and his family, doctors at the center performed a pig heart xenograft surgery on Fawcett on September 20 and injected him with anti-immune rejection antibody drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The experimental xenotransplantation procedure received emergency approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#39;s (FDA) &quot;Compassionate Use&quot; program, which is designed to treat patients when no other treatments are available. Investigational treatment assistance is provided to patients at risk of death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Preliminary observation results show that the patient recovered well two days after the operation, and the implanted pig heart functioned well without any auxiliary facilities. At that time, the patient was able to speak independently, sit up in a chair, and joke. One month after the patient&#39;s surgery, the University of Maryland Medical Center released a video showing that the patient was able to stand and walk with assistance. At that time, doctors claimed that no strong immune rejection reaction had been observed yet. However, the 1-3 months after organ transplantation is the most critical period, and it is also the period when immune rejection is strongest. According to the latest statement released by the University of Maryland Medical Center, Mr. Fawcett may have died of immune rejection, but the final results are pending further announcement. Bartley Griffiths, the surgeon in charge of the transplant, said in a statement, &quot;Mr. Fawcett&#39;s final wish was that we take full advantage of what we learned from the experience.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt; strong>;The first pig heart transplant provides valuable experience&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The first clinical trial of pig heart xenotransplantation in 2022 was also conducted by Mohammad Mohideen, professor of surgery at the University of Maryland Medical Center. Muhammad M. Mohiuddin and Bartley Griffith, a 57-year-old male patient with terminal heart disease, David Bennett, was implanted with a genetically modified pig heart, also derived from Revivicor Corporation. In the first few weeks after the transplant, Bennett showed no signs of acute rejection, but 2 months after the transplant, he died suddenly of heart failure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a research paper published in the internationally renowned medical journal &quot;New England Journal of Physicians&quot; by the team of Professors Mohideen and Professor Griffith, the patient&#39;s implanted pig heart developed severe edema and increased weight. Nearly doubled, myocardial cells showed scattered necrosis, showing typical characteristics of immune rejection that are inconsistent with xenogeneic organ transplantation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a more detailed analysis published by the team in another internationally renowned medical journal, The Lancet, there may be multiple causes that may have contributed to the patient&#39;s heart failure. On the one hand, the patient&#39;s endothelium was extensively damaged, indicating that the patient was subject to strong antibody-mediated immune rejection, and his immune system was severely compromised before surgery, making him more susceptible to attack by immune system antibodies. On the other hand, patients injected with anti-rejection antibody drugs after surgery may also cause damage to myocardial cells. In addition, doctors also detected porcine cytomegalovirus/porcine roseola virus in the implanted pig hearts, which may cause transplant dysfunction. However, no spillover of pig endogenous viruses into human tissues was detected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, based on the first case of pig heart xenotransplantation, this xenotransplantation clinical trial has made some improvements, such as using more sensitive detection methods to screen pig cells for the presence of pig endogenous Viruses are used to avoid the interference of pig endogenous viruses on the transplantation function, and also to avoid potential infection of the human body by pig viruses. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;More clinical trials are needed&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The shortage of organ transplant donors is a global medical problem. According to data from the official website of organ donors in the United States, about 104,000 patients are currently registered in need of organ transplants, and more than 3,000 of them need heart transplants. However, about 17 patients die every day because they cannot wait for an organ. In 2022, more than 42,000 people received organ transplants, including more than 25,000 kidney transplants, more than 9,500 liver transplants, and more than 4,100 heart transplants. Organ donors mainly rely on volunteer donations, but problems such as the low rate of voluntary organ donation and the difficulty in matching organs have led to a serious shortage of organ donors. Since the size, function and metabolic characteristics of pig organs are similar to those of human organs, and pigs have strong reproductive capabilities and are easy to carry out genetic manipulation, and unlike primates, there are no serious ethical controversies, so pig organs are considered human organs. important substitute. In fact, pigs have long been used in human medicine, including pig skin transplants and pig heart valve implants. In recent years, scientists from China and other countries have also conducted human clinical trials of porcine islet cell xenotransplantation, which has shown good efficacy in treating type 1 diabetes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, for xenogeneic organ transplantation to be successful, it needs to withstand multiple tests such as hyperacute rejection, acute vascular rejection and cellular rejection, because there are natural barriers between different species, and the tissues of other animals It is difficult for organs to survive in the human body for a long time. With the rise of genetic modification technology, scientists suddenly realized that if they use genetic modification technology to modify the cells of organ donor animals to be close to human cells, they can hope to avoid attacks by the human immune system. Therefore, genetically modified pigs that have been genetically modified to reduce immune rejection are also considered an important option to solve the organ shortage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before human clinical trials, research on xenotransplantation was mainly carried out on animals, such as transplanting pig organs into primates such as baboons. However, because these primates still have differences with humans, There is a large difference, and the maturity level of primate organ transplantation is much lower than that of human organ transplantation. Therefore, primate xenogeneic organ transplantation trials have limited reference value for human clinical trials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to conduct clinical trials, researchers are also trying to carry out xenogeneic organ transplantation in brain-dead patients. From October to December 2021, a research team from NYU Langone Health announced that they had successfully transplanted genetically modified pig kidneys produced by Revivicor into two people who were brain dead and relied on ventilators to maintain physical signs. in the patient&#39;s body. After more than two days of observation, the researchers found that the genetically modified pig&#39;s kidneys not only continued to filter waste and produce urine at a normal rate, but also restored the patient&#39;s abnormal creatinine levels caused by poor kidney function to normal levels, while during the observation period No severe rejection was observed either. Although this clinical trial was only conducted on brain-dead patients, the genetically modified pig kidneys could function normally in vitro and did not cause severe rejection. This is a great encouragement for the upcoming clinical trials of xenogeneic organ transplantation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the current two pig heart xenotransplantation patients have only survived for two months or less, the doctors, patients and their families in this clinical trial do not have high expectations for the clinical effects. In a sense, these brave early patients provided valuable experience for the clinical application of xenogeneic organ transplantation. For example, the results of the first xenotransplantation operation showed that the hearts of genetically modified pigs can function normally when the human immune system is fully suppressed, which established confidence for subsequent human clinical trials. In addition, the first xenogeneic organ transplant also discovered some factors that easily cause immune rejection and some potential safety risks, which can be avoided and eliminated in subsequent clinical trials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xenogeneic organ transplantation is undoubtedly a highly innovative and risky new therapy. Only by conducting more human clinical trials can problems be discovered in real human clinical trials and xenogeneic transplantation can be continuously improved. Organ transplant surgery-related procedures eliminate potential risks and continuously improve the patient&#39;s post-operative survival time and quality. It is expected that pig organs will eventually survive long-term and healthy in the human body, bringing good news to patients who cannot wait for human organs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 06 Nov 2023 19:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[最高法再审百亿金海矿山案，山西前首富张新明败诉]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260044]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-06 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;After the integration of coal resources in Shanxi began in 2009, the Jinhai Coal Mine was retained separately, and the market price soared. to 10 billion yuan.

Visual China/Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Shanxi “Ten Billion Mine Contest Case” that once shocked the legal community has taken a major turn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;17 years ago, Zhang Xinming, the former richest man in Shanxi and chairman of Jinye Group, and his related parties transferred their shares in Jinhai Coal Mine to the state-owned Shanxi Coal Transportation and Marketing Group Jincheng Yangcheng Co., Ltd. in order to alleviate their financial difficulties. (hereinafter referred to as Yangcheng Coal Transportation) and Qinhe Investment Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Qinhe Investment) headed by Lu Zhonglou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, as the Shanxi coal industry began to merge and reorganize in 2009, the value of Jinhai coal mine soared sharply. Zhang Xinming began to launch a series of lawsuits against Yangcheng Coal Transportation, Qinhe Investment and its chairman Lu Zhonglou. When the plaintiff transferred the equity to the defendant, the price was too low. Zhang Xinming won all these lawsuits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jinhai Coal Mine is located in Yangcheng County, Jincheng City, Shanxi Province. The coalfield area is about 53.7 square kilometers and the total resource reserves are 409 million tons. It is extremely rare in Shanxi, where coal mines are everywhere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The verdicts of this series of cases have caused huge controversy, and the fates of two coal tycoons, Zhang Xinming and Lu Zhonglou, have also taken different paths. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xinming is known as the &quot;Minister of Shanxi Underground Organization&quot;. In August 2014, Zhang Xinming was taken away by the public security organs in Taiyuan, and there has been no news since. Shanxi&#39;s officialdom also experienced constant earthquakes, and officials were dismissed one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, three of the above-mentioned series of lawsuits were heard by the Supreme People&#39;s Court of the People&#39;s Republic of China (hereinafter referred to as the Supreme Court) and the Shanxi Provincial Higher People&#39;s Court (hereinafter referred to as the Shanxi Provincial High Court), and the original judgments were revoked. Another case upheld the original verdict. Zhang Xinming, who had &quot;disappeared&quot; for more than nine years, also returned to the stage due to the reopening of these cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2023, Yangcheng Coal Transportation and Zhang Xinming’s son Zhang Wenyang were retried over the equity dispute in Jinhai Coal Mine. Zhang Xinming appeared at the court hearing as his son’s litigation agent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Informed sources revealed to Southern Weekend reporters that Zhang Xinming will be released from prison on medical parole in mid-2020, and the relevant judgment will be kept confidential. In a photo in May 2020, 57-year-old Zhang Xinming was sitting in a wheelchair, dressed casually and looking relaxed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the old and new judgments, a multi-party battle to grab the ore can be recreated. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Ten-billion mining case and the sacking of the Vice President of the Supreme People’s Court&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2004, Zhang Xinming obtained the mining rights of Jinhai Coal Mine and established Shanxi Jinhai Energy Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Jinhai) Energy), with a registered capital of 30 million yuan. Except for obtaining the mining license of Jinhai Coal Mine on March 15 of that year, the company has not conducted other investments and operations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, coal resources in Shanxi were still allocated administratively, and were either used free of charge by enterprises, or some symbolic resource fees were paid. This means that in a short period of time, those who obtain new mines can make huge profits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The mineral resource fee of Jinhai Coal Mine totals 224 million yuan (0.55 yuan/ton), which is paid in six years. In May 2004, Jinhai Energy paid the first installment of 37.3849 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2005, Jinhai Energy was short of funds and began to introduce external investors. At that time, Zhang Xinming and his related natural persons held 60% of the shares in Jinhai Energy, and Beijing Xinye Investment Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Beijing Xinye) held 40% of the shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of the above 60% shares&lt;span>;, Zhang Xinming holds 17%, his son Zhang Wenyang holds 40%, Feng Xiaolin holds 2%, and Wang Xiangdong holds 1%. &lt;/span>;Zhang Wenyang and Feng Xiaolin once stated during the trial that they were both acting on behalf of Zhang Xinming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Finance&quot; magazine once reported that Wang Xiangdong is the son of a former main leader of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee. People familiar with the case also confirmed this to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The original executive director and legal representative of Beijing Xinye is the mysterious Shanxi businessman Yan Qi. According to Caijing magazine, Yan Qi was originally a student of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Materials and Materials, and later founded Shanxi Yunchang Real Estate Company. He has never been involved in coal mining during his career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yan Qi later founded Sanya Luhuitou Tourist Area Development Co., Ltd. and developed the famous villa market &quot;Banshan Peninsula&quot;. Its subsidiaries also include Sanya Aidi Real Estate Company and Hong Kong Tianfu Company. &lt;span>;In 2015, Yan Qi ranked as the richest man in Hainan on the Hurun Rich List with assets of 9 billion yuan. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2005, Jinhai Energy and Yangcheng Coal Transportation signed an equity transfer agreement. Zhang Wenyang and Beijing Xinye transferred 13% and 15% of their equity respectively, and Yangcheng Coal Transportation paid for these equity A transfer price of 8.4 million yuan was obtained, which is equivalent to 300,000 yuan per share, which is the same as the registered capital price per share. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, Yangcheng Coal Transportation provided entrusted loans of 280 million yuan each to the Yuefeng Coal Washing Plant under Beijing Xinye and Jinye Group (Zhang Xinming is the chairman), with a term of 6 years, and the interest is based on bank deposit interest rates for the same period. calculate. After obtaining 28% of the equity of Jinhai Coal Mine, Yangcheng Coal Transportation paid another 74.76 million yuan in resource price, and Jinhai Energy’s mining rights were extended. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2007, Jinhai Energy also acquired Qinhe Investment from Lu Zhonglou as a shareholder. In September of that year, six shareholders of Jinhai Energy signed an equity transfer agreement with Qinhe Investment. Zhang Xinming, Zhang Wenyang, Feng Xiaolin, and Beijing Xinye transferred 17%, 27%, 2%, and 15% of their equity respectively to Qinhe Investment. The latter paid an equity transfer fee of 18.3 million yuan, which is also 300,000 yuan per share. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, Qinhe Investment also provided a 5-year interest-free loan of 375 million yuan to Beijing Xinye, and signed a loan agreement with Zhang Xinming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Beijing Xinye transferred its equity to Qinhe Investment, the two parties signed a supplementary agreement to change the transfer price of 15% of Beijing Xinye’s equity from 4.5 million yuan to 200 million yuan. It was previously agreed that The 375 million yuan loan lapsed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2009, 1% of Wang Xiangdong’s equity was transferred to Qinhe Investment for 300,000 yuan. At this point, the shareholders of Jinhai Energy have become Qinhe Investment, Yangcheng Coal Transportation and Beijing Xinye, with each of the three parties holding 62%, 28% and 10% of the shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this time, Shanxi coal resources began to merge and reorganize, but Jinhai Coal Mine was retained alone, and the market price soared to tens of billions of yuan. According to the above report, in the first half of 2009, Zhang Xinming repeatedly persuaded Lu Zhonglou to sell 62% of the Jinhai Coal Mine equity for 900 million yuan, but Lu disagreed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, Zhang Xinming began to sue Qinhe Investment and requested to terminate the equity transfer agreement on the grounds that the value of each equity share of Jinhai Coal Mine was much greater than 300,000 yuan. The lawsuit went all the way to the Supreme Court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The Supreme Court quoted the supplementary agreement between Beijing Xinye and Qinhe Investment, a non-party in the case, and considered that the transfer price of 15% of Jinhai Energy held by Beijing Xinye was changed to 200 million yuan, and held that Qinhe Investment changed from Zhang The market value of the 46%&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; equity transferred by Xinming Division should exceed&lt;/span>; 600 million yuan. The amount paid by Qinhe Investment was &quot;significantly lower than the market value of the equity involved in the case&quot;, and accordingly the original trial was upheld. The court supported Zhang Xinming’s request to terminate the contract, transfer Qin and return the equity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The case was judged in September 2012, and the case number was &quot;(2011) Minerzhongzi No. 76&quot;, also known as &quot;Judgment No. 76&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This verdict caused huge controversy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2013, two seminars on the &quot;Judgment No. 76&quot; were held in Beijing. More than 30 civil and commercial law scholars, including jurist Jiang Ping, professor of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Liang Huixing, and professor of China University of Political Science and Law Li Shuguang, attended discuss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liang Huixing said at the above-mentioned seminar that if coal prices did not rise, there would be no case. He believes that &quot;the Supreme Court made a judgment based on the principle of fairness, which is wrong.&quot; Since both parties are businessmen, the agreement between the two parties is fair. As long as it does not violate the law or harm the interests of the country and society, the court has no power to intervene. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The then Vice President of the Supreme People&#39;s Court&lt;span>;Xi Xiaoming also compiled the case into the book &quot;Supreme People&#39;s Court Commercial Trial Guidance Cases (2012) Company and Finance&quot;&lt;/span>;. In July 2015, Xi Xiaoming was investigated for suspected serious violations of discipline and law, and was eventually accused of accepting a huge financial bribe of 114 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to &quot;Caixin&quot; reports, Zhang Xinming paid 30 million yuan in bribes to Xi Xiaoming through a broker, of which 18 million yuan was given to Xi Xiaoming&#39;s son Xi Jiacheng, and the remaining 12 million yuan belonged to Xi Xiaoming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Judgment No. 76&quot; is the final judgment of the Supreme People&#39;s Court. If you are not satisfied with the judgment, Qinhe Investment can also apply for a protest to the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate. Lu Zhonglou told Southern Weekend reporters that Qinhe Investment is preparing to apply for a protest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the &quot;Judgment No. 76&quot;, from 2010 to 2012, related parties such as Yangcheng Coal Transportation, Qinhe Investment and Lu Zhonglou were also sued by Zhang Xinming and his associates, Beijing Xinye The lawsuit was filed, all demanding that the Jinhai Coal Mine Equity Transfer Agreement be terminated and that all parties return their equity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, there are 4 cases that were retried this time. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Restart&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Another person close to the Jinhai Coal Mine Equity Dispute case told Southern Weekend reporters that there has been no movement in this series of lawsuits for 10 years. He suddenly got the lawsuit at the end of 2022. It is known that the case will be restarted. After the spring of 2023, the pace of the trial will gradually slow down and return to a normal pace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2023, Yangcheng Coal Transportation received two final judgments one after another, from the Supreme People&#39;s Court and the Shanxi Provincial High Court, and the signing dates were September 7 and September 18, 2023 respectively. The original judgments were all revoked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2011 and 2012, Zhang Wenyang and Beijing Xinye sued Yangcheng Coal Transportation to court. They argued that the 28% equity transferred by Jinhai Energy to Yangcheng Coal Transportation included a loan principal of 560 million yuan. , please rule that the equity transfer agreement between the two parties is invalid and return the equity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The Shanxi Provincial High Court and Shanxi Jincheng Intermediate Court, the original courts of the two cases, both cited &quot;Judgment No. 76&quot; and held that Jinhai Energy&#39;s &quot;transfer price of 300,000 yuan per share was not between the parties to the agreement.&quot; True meaning &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&quot;, &lt;/span>; thereby supporting Zhang Wenyang and Beijing Xinye. Yangcheng Coal Transport was dissatisfied and appealed to the Supreme Court and Shanxi Provincial High Court respectively. Since then, there has been no progress in the two cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The Supreme People’s Court and the Shanxi Provincial High Court, which were responsible for the final review this time, believed that the entire transfer consideration of the 28% stake in Jinhai Energy involved included both the 8.4 million yuan clearly agreed in the transfer agreement and Zhang Xinming’s Fang used the business interests of 560 million yuan for 6 years through entrusted loans at low interest rates. Therefore, the original judgment was revoked and the validity of the equity transfer agreement was recognized. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The core requirement of the market economy legal system is the protection of property rights. These two judgments demonstrate the Supreme Court’s respect for the order of market transactions and the expression of the will of market entities.” Yangcheng Coal Transportation Lawyer Hu Xiaoyong told Southern Weekend reporters. He has taken over the equity dispute between Yangcheng Coal Transportation and Zhang Xinmingfang since 2012. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Commercial interests can be understood as opportunity value.” Hu Xiaoyong explained that Zhang Xinming obtained the opportunity value of using hundreds of millions of yuan of funds at low interest rates for 6 years, and then used it to invest in other real estate projects, thereby obtaining huge commercial interests. . These commercial interests together constitute the equity transfer price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On September 18, 2023&lt;/span>;, the Supreme People’s Court also made a final judgment on Beijing Xinye’s lawsuit against Qinhe Investment, revoking the original judgment and supporting some of Qinhe Investment’s requests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 2011&lt;/span>;, Beijing Xinye sued Qinhe Investment, saying that the two parties agreed that Qinhe Investment would transfer 15% of the equity transfer money to Beijing Xinye in the form of a loan, totaling 375 million yuan, 25 million yuan per share. &lt;span>;Beijing Xinye changed the equity information to the name of Qinhe Investment as promised&lt;/span>; Qinhe Investment only paid 200 million yuan, leaving 175 million yuan unpaid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beijing Xinye believed that Qinhe Investment constituted a fundamental breach of contract, and requested the first instance judgment to terminate the equity transfer agreement and the loan agreement between the two parties, and to allow the latter to return the equity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the trial of the case, Yan Qi, the legal representative of Beijing Xinye, denied that he had signed a supplementary agreement with Qinhe Investment, that is, the equity transfer amount was changed from 4.5 million yuan to 200 million yuan, and also reported to the police that he had signed a supplementary agreement with Qinhe Investment. The agreement was &quot;forged.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first-instance judgment of the Shanxi Provincial High Court also quoted &quot;Judgment No. 76&quot; and stated that &quot;Judgment No. 76&quot; and the 15% shares involved in the above-mentioned case &quot;were based on the same background, at the same shareholder meeting, at the same time.&quot; , changed at the same time with the same price per share&quot;, it is believed that &quot;the equity transfer price of 300,000 yuan per share is obviously low.&quot; In the end, it was ruled that the agreement was invalid and Qinhe Investment returned its equity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qinhe Investment was dissatisfied with the above-mentioned first-instance judgment and appealed to the Supreme Court. On May 29, 2013, the Supreme People&#39;s Court formed a collegial panel to hear the case, but nothing happened. In January 2023, the Supreme People’s Court heard the case again after the change of the collegial bench. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This time, the Supreme People’s Court accepted the supplementary agreement and determined that Qinhe Investment should pay Beijing Xinye the equity transfer price of 200 million yuan. It was finally recognized that Qinhe Investment had paid 147.265 million yuan for the equity transfer, corresponding to all 11.044875% of the equity, and the court ordered Qinhe Investment to return the remaining 3.955125% equity to Beijing Xinye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Basically fair.” Ji Jingwu, attorney for Qinhe Investment, told Southern Weekend reporters, but the judgment is still unsatisfactory. In his view, Beijing Xinye had admitted in the first instance that Qinhe Investment had paid 200 million yuan for the equity transfer, so Qinhe Investment no longer needed to prove this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On this basis, Ji Jingwu believed that &lt;span>; Beijing Xinye’s lawsuit on the grounds that Qinhe Investment failed to perform the loan agreement cannot be established, and the court should dismiss Beijing Xinye’s lawsuit in accordance with the law. The current judgment results in changing its litigation claims. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Empty the cage and change the bird&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;There is still one retrial to uphold the original verdict, which is also the earliest verdict among the four retrial cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On March 12, 2009, Wang Xiangdong, a shareholder of Jinhai Energy, signed a letter of authorization entrusting Yan Qi to handle the transfer of Jinhai Energy&#39;s equity interests. Yan Qi has served as the legal representative of Beijing Xinye and Jinhai Energy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 9 of that year, Yan Qi signed an equity transfer agreement with Qinhe Investment on behalf of Wang Xiangdong, stipulating that Wang Xiangdong would transfer 1% of the equity he held to Qinhe Investment for a price of 300,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In November 2011, Wang Xiangdong took Qinhe Investment to court. The reason was that the equity transfer price was too low. Please terminate the transfer agreement and return the equity. The case went through two trials, and the Shanxi Provincial High Court of the second instance upheld the original verdict on September 27, 2012, supporting Wang Xiangdong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Xiangdong acknowledged the authenticity of the power of attorney during the trial, but said he had no knowledge of the equity transfer and did not agree to transfer equity worth more than 20 million yuan with a registered capital value of 300,000 yuan. transfer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both courts of both instances held that the equity transfer price of 300,000 yuan was significantly lower than the transfer price that Yan Qi and Qinhe Investment knew of, and both parties transferred Wang Xiangdong’s equity at an obviously too low price without Wang Xiangdong’s consent. equity, harming its interests, and the behavior of Yan Qi and Qinhe Investment constituted malicious collusion. Qinhe Investment was dissatisfied and applied to the Supreme Court for retrial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main basis for the court of first instance to judge that Yan Qi knew that the equity transfer price was too low was the supplementary agreement signed between Beijing Xinye and Qinhe Investment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 28, 2023, the Supreme People’s Court made a final judgment on the case, still based on the supplementary agreement, and determined that 1% of Jinhai Energy’s equity would exceed 13 million yuan. Yan Qi and Qinhe Investment jointly Wang Xiangdong&#39;s rights and interests were damaged and the original verdict was upheld. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Ji Jingwu’s view, the case between Wang Xiangdong and Qinhe Investment is the simplest in the series of lawsuits over Jinhai Coal Mine equity disputes. “Does such a simple case need to be tried for 10 years?”&lt;/p>; &lt; p>; He believes that Wang Xiangdong entrusted Yan Qi with full authority to handle the equity transfer, so the equity transfer agreement signed by Yan Qi on behalf of Wang Xiangdong and Qinhe Investment did not exceed the agency authority. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, before the judgment of this case, the authenticity of the supplementary agreement had not been recognized by any court. Secondly, even if the agreement is genuine, the court determined that the equity transfer price in this case was low and unreasonable based on an agreement between a party outside the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I wonder if the disputes between shareholders can stop here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, after reexamination, the equity structure of Jinhai Energy has become: Zhang Xinmingfang 46%, Yangcheng Coal Transportation 28%, Beijing Xinye 13.955125%, Qinhe Investment 11.044875%, and Wang Xiangdong 1%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Jinhai Coal Mine, which was supposed to shine, has been in a state of stagnation over the years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 2021 coal mine classification list released by the Office of the Work Safety Committee of the Shanxi Provincial People&#39;s Government shows that Jinhai Coal Mine is a Class D coal mine, that is, a coal mine that has been suspended for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Jinhai Coal Mine may have new progress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2021, Jinhai Coal Mine appeared in the list of the first batch of projects released by Shanxi Provincial state-owned enterprises in 2021. The provincial state-owned enterprise is Jinneng Holding Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Jinneng Group). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>; &quot;Empty the cage and replace the bird&quot; is a key measure in the reform of Shanxi state-owned enterprises, which specifically includes disposing of inefficient and ineffective assets to effectively revitalize accumulated funds; selling part of the equity to recover cash while introducing various types of capital to achieve equity diversification; obtain funds by selling part of the shares of listed companies, optimize the equity structure of listed companies, etc. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why Jinhai Coal Mine is under the responsibility of Jinneng Group may be because Jinneng Group controls Yangcheng Coal Transportation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 20, 2022, the Yangcheng County People&#39;s Government Office issued the &quot;Notice on the Establishment of the Yangcheng Daning Jinhai Coal Mine Project Construction Leading Group&quot;. The notice stated that the Jinhai Coal Mine plans to officially start construction in the fourth quarter of 2022 , the construction period is two years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters repeatedly interviewed Zhang Wenyang (who holds Zhang Xinming’s behalf) and Beijing Xinye’s attorney through phone calls and text messages, but both declined to be interviewed. &lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; >;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 06 Nov 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[烂尾楼生活翻篇了，昆明“别样幸福城”业主圆了住房梦]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260052]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-06 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https:// feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 06 Nov 2023 17:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
