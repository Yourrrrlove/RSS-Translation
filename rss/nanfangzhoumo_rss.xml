Waking up early and staying late has become the norm. Getting up at 4 a.m. to go to the airport and returning home at 1:30 a.m. after finishing the day&#39;s activities is not an exception. Not staying out overnight is partly to take care of my young daughter’s emotions, but also to satisfy her pursuit of efficiency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She rarely used it to catch up on sleep when flying, but still raced against time to read and think. Since 2013, she has continued to travel to campuses of all ages, TV studios, events, lectures, forums, and dining tables used for live broadcasts and writing, sharing her deep dives in the Western Pacific with the &quot;Jiaolong&quot; Scientific expedition and the experience of participating in the 34th Antarctic Scientific Expedition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At first, she only gave lectures as a scientist as a researcher at the Second Institute of Oceanography of the Ministry of Natural Resources. Over the past ten years, she has gradually been dubbed a science popularization expert because of her tireless science popularization and vivid and humorous narration. title. In the past two years, she has won important honors such as Top Ten Science Communication Figures in China, Chief Science Communication Expert, and Female Science Popularization Expert. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the day of the interview, she spared a few hours, ate a sandwich at noon, and rushed home to prepare for the live broadcast at 4 p.m. Not long ago, she went to attend classes at universities and party schools. The topic she taught was the core of leadership from the perspective of biological evolution, from natural science to humanities and then to philosophy (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;This is her usual style&lt;/span>;), recalling her hearty smile and said, &quot;There was no urine in the whole process&quot;; then she was also invited to participate in a TED speech, the theme was &quot;If your major is a transfer, you What will happen next in life?” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Experienced the transition from engineering to science (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Undergraduate survey technology and engineering, postgraduate geological engineering, doctoral geology&lt;/p>; span>;), Tang Limei decided to switch his research field to marine geology after listening to a lecture by chance while studying for his PhD. He realized early on that life has no limits and is full of unexpected and unplanned nodes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With ten years of accumulation in science popularization, she will bring a new book &quot;Exploring the Deep Sea with the &quot;Dragon&quot;&quot; at the end of 2023 to show people a new face of a science popularization writer. The book will introduce the basic knowledge of the ocean (&lt;span style= &quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For example, what is the sea, what is the ocean, how to form&lt;/span>;), the five major oceans of the world (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Newly included in the Southern Ocean in 2021&lt;/span>;)&#39;s cutting-edge knowledge, personal experience in deep-sea exploration, and the development history of the country&#39;s manned deep submersibles, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It took less than half a year to write the book. She was busier than before. She didn&#39;t even have time to wash her face after getting up every morning. She said that her days now consist of only three things: work, exercise, and reading and thinking. She has been able to maintain her body shape for nearly 20 years after getting up early for a run. During the interview, she was wearing the team uniform she wore during the Antarctic scientific expedition in 2017, and it still fit her perfectly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other than that, there are very few pastimes, and I hardly watch movies. Everything I do must &quot;generate value and meaning.&quot; She would refuse without hesitation if asked to travel to the beach. Only when it became a matter of spending time with her children and family would she be willing to do so. &quot;I can&#39;t go out to play by myself, but I&#39;m willing to do it with others. It&#39;s valuable.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She recalled more than ten years ago when life was not so full. , I still have plenty of time to watch &quot;The Legend of Zhen Huan&quot;, and during the period when I went to the Pacific to &quot;isolate&quot;, I watched it intermittently nearly 20 times in total. &quot;It wouldn&#39;t be so busy then. I would definitely choose to read a book now.&quot; It wasn&#39;t until 2022 that she turned the content of the TV series into a class, and then she finally let go of the time wasted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/GDFKKq1U2uGe4wXxCkfhZo5gEfOBJvo01JL7UOFU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/GDFKKq1U2uGe4wXxCkfhZo5gEfOBJvo01JL7UOFU.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259210&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Ocean Open Class&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(video screenshot/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The lecture content revolves around &quot;Zhen Huan&quot; &quot;Scientific trivia in the Biography&quot;, &quot;For example, there is an episode where the emperor went to An Lingrong&#39;s place to celebrate her birthday. He was very tired of eating, so he happened to get him some light pastries. Why do we eat dessert after a meal? It&#39;s because we The perception of sweetness is at the tip of the tongue, and the perception of bitterness is at the back of the tongue, and then there are other areas in the middle, such as spicy food. Therefore, we can still eat something sweet after a meal because we can feel sweetness at the tip of the tongue at the earliest. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There is also braised pork, which is the Maillard reaction. Isn&#39;t the Maillard color popular this year? Maillard is actually caramel color, which is what it turns into after the sugar is burned. Color, what happens between it and braised pork is the Maillard reaction. Why do we need to add sugar? When you make braised pork, you can educate your children about science. These knowledge points are closely related to life; and why do we have oleander powder? Poisonous? I explained its formula, and then what is the most poisonous part of it? Tree trunks, leaves and flowers are all poisonous. Finally, why are these women fighting in the play? These are the backward ideas of feudal society. Let’s talk about it finally. The awakening of women in our new era includes humanistic methods.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She believes that subject segmentation is actually unscientific because &quot;all knowledge is interlinked&quot; and is often lacking in the dissemination of knowledge. Not even one. She likes the title of &quot;Science Communication Figure&quot;, &quot;It&#39;s quite appropriate. Just like preaching, science is also a cognitive system.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She looks at everything around her with a comprehensive view of the universe and cherishes it. Curious, &quot;Actually, everything is learning. You may have thought it was entertainment before, but with a learning mentality, if you really understand the background, culture or meaning of TV series, movies and other cultural works, it is actually learning.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;In her spare time during the Antarctic scientific expedition, Tang Limei also watched a few sporadic movies, including the literary film &quot;Sunset Trilogy&quot; series, which she also watched repeatedly. What attracts her is not the romantic encounter between the male and female protagonists, but the social topics that the two communicate and discuss from sunset to sunrise. &quot;In fact, the most attractive thing about it is its topic. It is not that two people are in love, they discuss They are all the destruction of society by developed countries, the infringement of weak countries, the garbage we produce now, the underlying logic of society, etc.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She has also watched some of &quot;Celebrating More Than Years&quot; and she likes it. With time-travel elements, I am also planning to write some science fiction novels next, &quot;For example, two fishes (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;because we humans evolved from fish (&lt;/span>;), a story of pure love that has gone through five mass extinctions, nine evolutions, and then traveled through several lives. In this long evolution, &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; is set in the universe. It may be based on the hundreds of millions of years of biological evolution.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that she is in the conceptual stage, she is already very excited. &quot;It should be particularly enjoyable if I write it later. In fact, this is a process of creation. The meaning of life lies in creation. Only when you create something you love, will you feel happy and in a flow.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2019, she participated in a training session at the Youth League School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and later became a member of the Youth Lecturers Group of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. Since then, she has frequently given lectures in colleges and universities. She noticed that the new generation of young people are increasingly concerned about spiritual values. &quot;Public welfare must be the trend in the future. There will definitely be more and more people engaged in charity and volunteer services among the post-2000 generation, because it may be difficult for them to make a rapid economic leap from their work, so they will look for other ways. To realize your own value, engage more in charity and manual work, that is, to help others and feel happiness from the process of serving others.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There will be more and more of these industries, like my daughter, What can you say to make her feel happy? It’s not that her mother went to her school and gave a speech. Everyone regarded me as an idol and worshiped me. This was a pressure for her; her happiness was similar to that once I took her to a friend&#39;s birthday party, and after she gave the butterfly she made with a twist stick to someone else, she felt sincerely happy because of the other person&#39;s gratitude.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first book has not yet been released, and it is non-stop. Tang Limei has already begun to imagine her future &quot;writing ambitions&quot;. &quot;If I publish one book every year, I can probably write 20 more in my life. I hope one or two of them will be popular science classics for teenagers.&quot; Through these words again and again. and written words. What she is committed to disseminating is not only scientific knowledge, but also &quot;the meaning of life.&quot; She hopes that her slightly tortuous but persevering experience can inspire young people and make those young faces in the audience understand, &quot;Everyone should have their own way out and live well.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https ://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot; color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 26 Nov 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[吴慷仁，给自己拍拍手吧]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261336]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-26 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/25/ZJCNUHvqqsswjIpk4Tq6AEUJT96BP6xETrXHQmgA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/ZJCNUHvqqsswjIpk4Tq6AEUJT96BP 6xETrXHQmgA. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259646&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wu Kangren (Visual China) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Newcomer Wu Kangren&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Wu Kangren is standing in the middle of the lobby of a hotel in Xiamen, dancing and talking with people. The companion said: &quot;Please be gentle and don&#39;t attract too much attention.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;No one will pay attention to us. Everyone is living their own lives.&quot; He waved his hand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most watched Taiwanese actor at the moment, the favorite to win the Golden Horse Award this year, has long been able to get along with his fame calmly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first few years when he became famous, he avoided the public and social media, wore a mask when going out, and hated being stared at. By 2015, he left his agent to work independently. Just before he was about to win his first Golden Bell Award, Wu Kangren suddenly took off his mask. &quot;Wearing a mask is uncomfortable,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When someone looked at him, he looked back with a smile; when someone patted him, he waved his hand from a distance; when someone stared at him, he slowly changed his position to avoid it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“When I didn’t care much about what other people thought of me, I felt a lot less burdened.” Wu Kangren said, “I began to realize that the identity I originally cared about was just my career and an external label. . I want to get back my identity and my life. What I have to do at the moment is the most important, such as going out to buy things.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past ten years, Wu Kangren has starred in many word-of-mouth movies. Taiwanese dramas, from the early years of &quot;A Handful of Youth&quot; (2015), &quot;Narcotic Storm&quot; (2015), and &quot;The Distance Between Us and Evil&quot; (2019), to this year&#39;s &quot;Copycat&quot; and &quot;In This Lifetime&quot; and so on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/lsUeNjPOXDad6Xuhj9oOrsYkYWA3xi4XUpRhHhER.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/lsUeNjPOXDad6Xuhj9oOrsYkYWA3xi4XUpRhHhER.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259638&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Anesthesia Storm (2015) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images .infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/JMp34TCWepLXusVDnaeFp4VgEQVA5mTkRV7GI3Xc.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1546&quot; height=&quot;1000&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/23/11/25/JMp34TCWepLXusVDnaeFp4VgEQVA5mTkRV7GI3Xc.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259644&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The distance between us and evil (2019) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11 /25/BPg5JnRngcNlpaDsl2IZ1i5Cg3Lvtzm9Rmamjvjq.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2160&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/BPg5JnRngcNlpaDsl2IZ1i5Cg3Lvtz m9Rmamjvjq.jpg &quot; data-key=&quot;259643&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Copycat (2023) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/ span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Wu Kangren always says that no one knows him every time he comes to the mainland, and he mostly observes from the sidelines; even though the mainland media always give him this title repeatedly - &quot;The most powerful Chinese TV star!&quot; He should have been popular! &quot;But every time he came to the mainland in the past five years, he had a busy schedule, and everywhere he went there were crowds and cheers. In Xiamen, young people shouted to him: &quot;Gao Jiayue, praise, praise, praise!&quot; &quot;Gao Jiayue is his character in the new drama &quot;Lifetime&quot;, and his catchphrase is &quot;Zan Zan Zan&quot;. At the post-screening event of the movie &quot;Fudu Youth&quot;, many viewers expressed happily: Wu Kangren, I have liked you for many years, I hope you can win this year&#39;s Golden Horse Best Actor!&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Fudu Youth&quot; is directed by Malaysian director Ong Lilian and stars Wu Kangren and Chen Chak Yao. It has won awards at many international film festivals. Wu Kangren won this year&#39;s First Youth Award Best Actor at the Film Festival.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He received the First trophy in Xiamen, took a group photo, and then held it halfway. He was also the Best Actor in this year&#39;s First Film Festival media selection. When he heard that there were also trophies for the venue selection, he shook with joy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He cherishes every recognition he gets, whether it is an award or the favor of his seniors. This is why he often plays guest roles. : To repay a favor. He made a cameo appearance as a pervert who sexually harassed a female subordinate in the TV series &quot;Her and Her Her&quot;, but he couldn&#39;t find an actor for this disgusting role. Out of gratitude for the producer of the show who had taken care of him in the past, Wu Kangren took over the role. The original male lead of &quot;Copycat&quot; missed the appointment due to schedule, and the crew was at a standstill. They were in urgent need of a replacement who could be accepted by Netflix. It was Wu Kangren again. In order not to affect the follow-up film appointments, he rushed to work for 16 days in a row. He only sleeps two or three hours a day.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He thanked Chen Huiling, the director of &quot;Next Stop, Happiness&quot; many times. &quot;(To the director) jokingly said that there was no opportunity to perform in &quot;Next Stop&quot; at that time, maybe now I was still serving plates in restaurants and stuff like that, but I actually meant it. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2009, Wu Kangren starred in the idol drama &quot;Next Stop, Happiness&quot; as Hua Takuya, the second male lead who silently protected the heroine for many years and finally let go. He created a chapter in the history of Taiwanese idol dramas Classic: With tears in his eyes, he suppressed the sadness rushing out of his chest, and said to the heroine with a smile: &quot;Why, I was the one who met you first, but you still chose to lead him six years ago and six years later. hand. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/UfGy4Qfh5w7K2VHjG4Qa5ctSc3ksZ3zcvRcMN3h6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height =&quot;1024&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/UfGy4Qfh5w7K2VHjG4Qa5ctSc3ksZ3zcvRcMN3h6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259648&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot; color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Next Stop, Happiness (2009) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I watched it for the first time He was surprised when he was acting, how could someone crying be so touching. I asked director Chen Huiling, and the director said it was because he was acting with his life. &quot;said screenwriter Lu Shiyuan. Wu Kangren later became the leading actor in her works &quot;The Exit Office&quot; and &quot;The Distance Between Us and Evil&quot;. Both of these dramas brought Wu Kangren nominations for Best Actor at the Golden Bell Awards.&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;In this way, Wu Kangren, who had just quit his job as a bartender, emerged with &quot;Hua Tuoye&quot;. At the age of 27, he encountered his favorite job: acting. &quot;After acting reaches a certain stage, it is no longer for me. A way to make money for a living. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, &quot;Next Stop, Happiness&quot; was the last peak of Taiwanese idol dramas. Since then, Taiwanese dramas, which have been popular in Asia for ten years, have been declining. What is mutually responsible for the decline of Taiwanese dramas is that mainland TV dramas and Korean dramas gradually occupied Taiwanese TV stations, and Taiwanese dramas that lost their audience also lost the funds of the TV stations. It was also at that time that the backbone of Taiwanese dramas and future stars, such as Ethan Ruan, Zhao Youting, Chen Bolin, Ariel Ariel, Chen Qiaoen, etc., all turned to the mainland Development.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Newcomer Wu Kangren stayed in Taiwan and worked hard to act in his own way.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Like a foreign worker&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Starring &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; was won by Wu Kangren.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What he saw was the synopsis of the venture capital period. He liked it very much after reading it, so he met with Wang Lilin. The atmosphere of the meeting was harmonious, but there was no further discussion after that. Contact us.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the next eight months, Wu Kangren finished filming two movies and was resting at home. One day he was staring at his cat and suddenly felt that filming in Taiwan was out of his comfort zone, and he wanted to change places. He thought of &quot;Fudu Youth&quot;, so he called the director and asked if you were still filming and if you didn&#39;t plan to find me.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The director also told me honestly: they do have other candidates. . But I feel that I am very sincere and can go to Malaysia a month earlier and the (remuneration) can be cheaper. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Wu Kangren, &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; is a rare opportunity. Nowadays, professional dramas are popular in Taiwan. He has portrayed etiquette masters, lawyers, prosecutors, etc. He has also tried many unconventional characters, For example, mamasang, habitual thieves who steal women&#39;s underwear, etc. This is how he trains himself.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/25/oFjvo5nnR54pP2w1ScDw66JDokygZzTeBkAo528W.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/oFjvo5nnR54pP2w1ScDw66JDokygZzTe BkAo528W. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259639&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Fudu Youth (2023) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Fudu Youth&quot; is different. The people in the film have no career difficulties. They seem unconventional and marginal, but they actually exist in Malaysia. It tells the story of a pair of undocumented foreign workers. The brothers are living an ignoble existence in an old community in Fudu where foreign workers gather. The elder brother Abang (played by Wu Kangren) was born mute, and he works hard and accepts his fate. The younger brother Adi (played by Chen Zeyao) is unwilling to bow to fate. He only wants to make money and takes his brother with him. Leave this disgusting place.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Lilin is the producer of the movies &quot;Decibel Life&quot; and &quot;Lost Andy&quot;. When he was filming for &quot;Decibel Life&quot;, he observed that there were many problems in the Pudu community of Kuala Lumpur. Foreign workers, lonely elderly people, transgender people, etc. Three years later, he decided to shoot his first film with some unidentified people as the protagonists in the market of Fudu.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot; Since &quot;Decibel Life&quot;, I have wanted to be close to these people, and I feel very strongly about them. &quot;Wang Lilin said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This movie, from the director to the leading actors, followed the principle of &quot;really listening, seeing, and feeling.&quot; After Wu Kangren and Chen Zeyao worked in the market and learned sign language for about a month, the movie was released in Filming in Fudu has officially started.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fudu has a smell. The market where you work has the smell of fish, chicken and sweet fruits, and the enclosed building where you live has the smell of food, soap, sweat and Urine.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the film, there is a close-up scene of washing hands. Wu Kangren carefully rubs each fingernail. &quot;This is indeed an action I do every day at the end of the day, because the smell on my hands is so rich. &quot;Wu Kangren said, &quot;When I smoked, I smelled the smell of offal on my fingertips, so I thought, hey, I should wash it again. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The script gives branches, but the flesh and blood of the film depends on the actors themselves.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Abang makes a living by killing chickens and moving goods, so Wu Kangren killed chickens that were 20 days old— —Although the director initially did not plan to shoot a scene of killing a chicken. Eggs can be found by poking the butt of a chicken, and foreign workers often eat the eggs raw. They wanted to give them to Wu Kangren several times, and Wu Kangren repeatedly said, &quot;Thank you, thank you, thank you.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;Although the raw eggs were not eaten, Wu Kangren brought this detail into the movie: Abang, who came home from work, carried a bag of eggs and shared them with his neighbor and his daughter.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He wanted to let I am truly like a foreign worker in a rich city. Not only can I work, but I have also become black, thin and slovenly. &quot;When I first went there, I was like this now. I weighed more than 70 kilograms in vain. Don&#39;t spill the soup on me. appearance. &quot; He recalled, &quot;But when you really step into that market, you will find that everyone looks at you very differently, and you are out of place. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He imitated the state of foreign workers, unkempt, with sweat and animal blood on his body, and the look in his eyes was tired after repeating the action of killing chickens two hundred times a day. They collected money and handed over He had no energy to have more interactions with people.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He was killing chickens while approaching Fudu. He smoked, ate, and chatted with the foreign workers, looking at the expired passports they carried with them, and listening to their He talked about having a girlfriend or quarreling with his wife. He observed rats and said that he had never seen rats that looked like they had been trained. They ran past in groups, clanking and clanking, and dispersed like Moses parting the sea when they saw people. Together again.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he felt that there were no more eyes sizing him up, he knew that he could play Abang.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From May to August 2022, Wu Kangren completed filming continuously In &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; and the Hong Kong movie &quot;May I Live Forever&quot;, after four months of starvation, a 1.78 meter man lost weight to 53 kilograms. He did not want to say how much weight he had lost, after all, &quot;if the film was not filmed well , everyone thinks you are just thin, what’s the big deal?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/HR6YC0Q5tY8zSLc1MzpQtmSFEmEJMYfHTCgmVBXT .jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/HR6YC0Q5tY8zSLc1MzpQtmSFEmEJMYfHTCgmVBXT.jpg&quot; data-key =&quot;259640&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;May you live forever (2023) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the film comes to an end, Abang does not eat or drink in prison and wants to die. Wu Kangren also fasted to keep himself in a state of malaise that continues to decline.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He made fasting easy, saying that once he fasted his skin would be healed, white and smooth.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years, Wu Kangren&#39;s weight change curve, which has waxed and waned due to his acting roles, is a series of &quot;W&quot;s, at 30 kg The gap fluctuated between them. When he first lost weight rapidly for the movie &quot;Termites&quot; (2016), he was a little optimistic, thinking that if his body changed first, he would be able to observe the psychological changes. He was also a little intentional, thinking that this might be able to be used in acting. There are unexpected effects.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before becoming an actor, he sweated and sweated on the construction site and got paid, so he firmly believed that hard work would be rewarded. He washed cups in the kitchen and had to work on the countertop and off stage. Just as clean, this later even became his belief: I, Wu Kangren, show you the same in person as I do in private. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same goes for getting fatter and thinner. No one knew what to gain by acting like this, but he wanted to know; he&#39;d tried it, so he knew the power of shape-shifting. &quot;I&#39;m quite fortunate to have done this. It helped me a lot.&quot; He said, &quot;This is irreplaceable and is self-cultivation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Mute&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; h4>; &lt;p>;When &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; was finalized, the crew gave Wu Kangren a cake, and he started crying when he saw the cake. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I can finally eat!&quot; He said that he was so excited that he cried. &quot;I went to eat chicken the day after the filming was completed!&quot; Once again, Wu Kangren solved the difficulty with a joke. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before Abang was executed, the prison arranged for him to meet with the Master for his final confession. In this play, the director gave full play to &quot;listening, watching, and feeling&quot;: Wu Kangren&#39;s script only has the word &quot;accusation&quot; and no lines; the master is a real eminent monk, Master Kaizhao who has been preaching Buddhism to death row prisoners for more than 30 years. , and there is no script. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Kangren and the director rehearsed the scene more than thirty times, trying to understand why Abang had such a strong reaction to release himself in such a situation. &quot;We can imagine that he will have a display of strength in the end, but we didn&#39;t understand where the base point of strength is.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/11/25/PnousbgA6PNRLpQfUXmEoJ692wqpfd4Yaarsu6IS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/ 25/PnousbgA6PNRLpQfUXmEoJ692wqpfd4Yaarsu6IS.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259641&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Fudu Youth (2023) &lt;span style=&quot;color: # aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the long preparation period and the shooting in chronological order, the actors have enough time to integrate into the characters, so when Wu Kangren heard Master Kaizhao say &quot;live well&quot; , suddenly mourning Abang endlessly. &quot;Living well is the most difficult thing for him. What seems simple to us is a luxury for them. So we must start from this sentence.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Abang and Adi cannot rent The house often wakes up from sleep in the middle of the night to avoid inspection; it is impossible to open a bank account, and all the working money is kept in a rusty cookie box; I cannot buy a motorcycle because I cannot get a driver&#39;s license, so I can only take the bus or walk everywhere. Without status, they will always be forced to work as laborers in Fudu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Abang once encountered love, but it was fleeting; he once thought he could live a stable life with his brother in Fudu, but his fate overturned it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But they also had their happy moments. Abang, Adi and Sister Money, a transgender person, depend on each other - in Malaysia, transgender people have no identity in another sense - they eat together and dance together. Three people hit their heads with eggs at the dinner table, screaming and laughing in pain. This is Wu Kangren&#39;s favorite scene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I think the most precious thing is the smiles in life. Throughout the play, they rarely smile, and the things that are taken for granted in life are too harsh for them.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, Facing Master Kaizhao, Abang complained: I always wonder why I was born, I have no home, I don’t even have parents, I can only watch from a distance. I&#39;m jealous of you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I want to be like you. But I can&#39;t! Why is this? I want to talk, I want to be loved and liked, but there is nothing. You told me not to give up, to keep living. But I can&#39;t do it at all. I always have to be careful, alert, hiding, running away. It&#39;s not fair, I did something wrong.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;My life is terrible and I want to change my life, but Impossible. I have no future.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These accusations were made in sign language and facial expressions. The expressions on those who carefully observed the surroundings, the echo of the wrist chain hitting the table, and the tears that had been rolling in the eye sockets for a long time but did not fall, all made this silent accusation deafening. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Don&#39;t preach to me, I have no identity.&quot; Abang pointed to the code on his prison uniform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Master Kaizhao suddenly held Abang’s hand. Abang calmed down, tears fell, and he sobbed out incomprehensible syllables: &quot;I want to die, I want to die, I want...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He looked around and found that no one could understand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Abang is mute, which is a fateful coupling. &quot;A group of people without identity are just like the mute. Even if they speak out, there will be no change.&quot; Wu Kangren said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Chen Zeyao, who played the younger brother, later saw this silent accusation on the screen, he was shocked and hurt, &quot;It turns out that this is what Abang thinks. It turns out that he has always felt that he is a shadow. I can&#39;t be with you.&quot; I talk too much about my inner feelings because it really hurts.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the scene where the brothers bid farewell, Chen Zeyao instinctively expressed his feelings for his brother in sign language. &quot;I burst into tears and forgot to say my lines. Later I found out that everyone can feel it even if I don&#39;t say my lines.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Abang, next time, I say next time, I will be your brother to protect you.&quot; Adi said. More than 20 years ago, street children Abang and Adi met on the street and became brothers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Wang Lilin, the &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; presented now has fulfilled his expectations. &quot;I want to talk about human emotions in the context of foreign workers in Fudu, and the precious warmth and goodwill between people in such a cruel and oppressive society.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;What about Wu Kangren, right? What can we expect from &quot;Fudu Youth&quot;?&quot; we asked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Just don&#39;t lose money, it&#39;s a movie they worked so hard to make.&quot; He replied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The day after filming wrapped, Wu Kangren posted on social media: &quot;We have done a great thing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/23/11/25/1Mj220voE9O4TyIqiVik3Kr0yE1Alckh7WTsQfLg.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;686&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/11/25/1Mj220voE9O4TyIqiVik3Kr0yE1Alckh7WTsQfLg.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259642&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa; &quot;>;(Wu Kangren’s personal social media account/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Clap your hands&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2016, Wu Kangren won the first prize with his role in &quot;A Handful of Youth&quot; The role of &quot;Guo Zhen&quot; won the Golden Bell Award for Best Actor. This is one of the most successful characters he has created, mixed with a cynical sense of youth and the vicissitudes of war and life and death, and with deep love for his lover, he was extinguished in the gunfire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;His acceptance speech was like a plea: a plea for more resources for actors, a plea for TV stations to develop more different types of dramas. &quot;They (actors) are waiting, just like me before, waiting for someone like Director Cho Sei-won to choose me. We need more resources to help us. Maybe we are not the most talented, but we can always be the most talented. The one who works hard.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/6cdQYotwZsx1KCe1gvLjXjL3iGl88Q4QZOBu9i37.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width= &quot;960&quot; height=&quot;673&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/6cdQYotwZsx1KCe1gvLjXjL3iGl88Q4QZOBu9i37.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259645&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt; p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A handful of green (2015) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relying on government subsidies and Later, with the investment of streaming media platforms, Taiwanese dramas have been innovative in the past few years. Around 2015, &quot;A Handful of Youth&quot; and the genre dramas &quot;Exit Office&quot; and &quot;Narcotic Storm&quot; were regarded as the first new trend. After 2019, dramas that focus on social issues, such as &quot;The Distance Between Us&quot; and &quot;The Distance Between Us&quot;, mark that Taiwanese dramas have basically passed the trough period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the above-mentioned Taiwanese dramas, Wu Kangren played the leading role. From idol dramas to realism, his acting career overlaps with the ups and downs, changes and breakthroughs of Taiwanese dramas in the past 15 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;To be honest, I became famous because there was a shortage of people (filming) in Taiwan at that time. There were not many Taiwanese actors my age.&quot; He said in an interview with &quot;Taiwan Film&quot; at the end of 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he entered the industry, he thought that he was not outstanding in appearance and qualifications, but &quot;hard work is more important than talent.&quot; When he was working as a bartender, he didn&#39;t speak English, so after finishing work in the early morning, he would go to the all-night Eslite Bookstore, read bartending books, and memorize words in Pinyin. Many years later, when the media interviewed the bar owner, the bar owner described Wu Kangren as &quot;a life on the line&quot;: a lifetime of hard work for one thing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He went through phases of conceitedness. He knows what he is doing, he gives 200%, is strict with himself, and requires everyone around him to work as hard as he does. &quot;I used to be quite radical at work, so there were rumors that Wu Kangren was difficult to deal with. Only in the past two years have I gradually realized that this is a team work.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But precisely because Wu Kangren always emphasized hard work, He often says that he is not talented enough, and few people talk about his talent as an actor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He has beautiful eyes and expressive features, which makes him good at performing explosive moments with complex emotions. He is good at observation and describes many details of the old district of Fudu vividly and vividly. Although he is taciturn and serious in daily life, when standing on the stage and in front of the camera, he is talkative and humorous, with rich expressions and body movements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He is confident that he can persist in acting and yearns to be a good actor like Li Xuejian for a lifetime, but he is also not optimistic about his career as an actor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I don&#39;t think I will always be able to act. I just want to be exposed to many possibilities earlier and faster. It may only take three to five years to act in a film. I strive for it because of fate.&quot; He thought for a while and said, &quot;You won&#39;t see &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; again in five years. I have been in the industry for 15 years and only saw &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; once.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is This is the reason why he tried a variety of unconventional roles after 2015. He wanted to know how many possibilities he had and how to improve his performance. He went to training classes to practice his vocal skills; he filmed 5 movies in 2022 and felt very at ease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps because he does not have an agent, Wu Kangren has limited access to film resources. He has expressed his love for mainland art films several times, and he also admitted that he respects acting in mainland China. &quot;You have to be prepared before going, not just to make money and leave.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But it is also because Without an agent, Wu Kangren makes all his work decisions by himself. After experiencing a period of panic, he is now very accustomed to this way of working: he knows what is important, and he just needs to perform well. He can take care of himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He yearns for Hong Kong actors in the golden age of Hong Kong films, such as Tony Leung Ka-fai, Tony Leung Chiu-wai, and Andy Lau. &quot;Each actor has accumulated hundreds of films and has his own place.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/3ps1FPdK7ZJ6bSD1hSXs9Jb3QbmFYuu7aYJgorhx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src =&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/3ps1FPdK7ZJ6bSD1hSXs9Jb3QbmFYuu7aYJgorhx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259647&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text- align: center;&quot;>;In My Lifetime (2023) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The title of &quot;In My Lifetime&quot; is Gao Jiayue&#39;s life summary. Gao Jiayue scrawled and corrected it and wrote on the back of the &quot;suicide note&quot;: It would be good to grow this big in my lifetime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Kangren started working at the age of 14. The first job was to do electrical box welding with bare eyes. After work, my vision was so white that I thought I was going blind. Since then, he has worked more than 50 jobs, shuttling between 20-story scaffolding without safety helmets and safety nets, washing dishes, cutting vegetables, and entertaining guests in various restaurants. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Twenty years later, Wu Kangren was asked what he wanted to say to himself at that time. He replied:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;15-year-old Wu Kangren, the things you were afraid of at that time, None of this happened, because you didn’t learn bad things, and you are taking good care of your mother now. Your decision at that time was right, and you got a wonderful life in exchange for it, so give yourself a pat on the back.”&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;He raised his hands above his head and clapped himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 26 Nov 2023 10:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[首位博士说丨林超民：研究历史才能看到未来]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261332]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-26 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 2, 2023, Lin Chaomin was at the Wu Mayao Anthropology Museum of Yunnan University.

It is close to Green Lake. Every winter, you can see the scenery from A red-billed gull flies from Siberia to spend the winter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1962, Lin Chaomin was admitted to Yunnan University as a history major. At that time, the Department of History gathered together scholars such as Fang Guoyu, Jiang Yingliang, Yang Kun, and Li Wei to establish the first Chinese ethnic history major. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The first time he came into contact with the ethnic history major in a relatively systematic way was due to the &quot;special task&quot; Lin Chaomin was assigned before graduation: Fang Guoyu, who would become his mentor in the future. Collect &quot;evidence of guilt&quot; from his writings. Yunda University students only have 6 library cards, but Lin Chaomin, who shoulders the &quot;task&quot;, after receiving 20 library cards, plunged into Fang Guoyu&#39;s works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As a result, &quot;After reading for a long time, I didn&#39;t find anything reactionary about Mr. Fang, but I myself became interested in the study of national history.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Later, due to various reasons, this class of history students who were full of expectations for the future were collectively sent to farms for re-education after six years of undergraduate studies. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In May 1970, Lin Chaomin was assigned to work as a worker in the Menghai Tea Factory in Xishuangbanna Province, and later taught in Menghai No. 1 Middle School. During this period, he was appreciated by Ren Jiyu, professor of the Department of Philosophy at Peking University, for an article discussing Confucius&#39; thoughts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1978, Lin Chaomin was 33 years old. He heard that he could take the postgraduate entrance examination, so he thought of the Chinese Ethnic History major at Yunnan University. But compared with the exam, getting people released from middle school was more difficult. “I went to the then county party secretary Yan Xiangkan, who was from the Blang ethnic group. When he heard that I was going to study ethnic history, I immediately Said, &#39;I hope you will study the history of our Brown people carefully.&#39;&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some people once commented that Lin Chaomin was &quot;a pioneer in the trend.&quot; In 1985, he passed the defense , became the first doctorate in Chinese national history. One of his mentors, Jiang Yingliang, has a plan for him: &quot;He is expected to make creative achievements in the study of ethnic history. We hope that he will not be held in administrative affairs, which will affect his research and teaching.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, after graduating from the Ph.D., he was immediately appointed as the deputy director of the History Department of Yunnan University, and later served as the vice president of Yunnan University. As an administrator, he once faced the question of where the history department should go in the face of the decline of liberal arts. At that time, in the context of difficulty in recruiting students, allocating resources, and generating income, many teachers called the history department a &quot;shit pit&quot; and shouted that they should jump out of the &quot;shit pit.&quot; pit&quot;. During his tenure, Lin Chaomin successively organized and applied for history base classes, established anthropology, social work and other majors, and established the first Institute of Film and Television Anthropology in Asia, allowing this university located in the southwest border to seize the opportunity in the discipline establishment. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After retirement, Lin Chaomin can spend time on research. In recent years, he has paid special attention to the integrity of Chinese history. On October 28, 2023, he organized a seminar on Fang Guoyu&#39;s historical thoughts to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the publication of the theory &quot;On the Integration of Chinese Historical Development&quot; and the 120th anniversary of Fang Guoyu&#39;s birth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 2, 2023, on the campus of Yunnan University, Lin Chaomin accepted an exclusive interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Lin Chaomin&#39;s doctoral thesis defense scene, taken in 1985.

When the Japanese occupied Tengchong in 1942, my parents fled to Dali, where I was born. After the Chinese Expeditionary Force recaptured Tengchong in September 1944, we came back from Dali. At that time, Tengchong was bombed by aircraft and artillery due to the Anti-Japanese War. The city was in rubble, with almost no standing house. The central primary school where we study is the Confucian Temple. The Japanese used it as a headquarters before. It has been preserved because of its strong construction. There are still many bullet holes in the walls and pillars inside. When I was in sixth grade, the school was building a sports ground and we dug up a lot of bullet casings and bayonets from Type 38 rifles. It wasn’t until I graduated from high school in 1962 and entered college that I left Tengchong. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When I was young, I didn’t know what to do, I just knew that I wanted to read good books. At that time, my mother subscribed to different magazines for each age group of us brothers and sisters. For example, when I was very young, I read &quot;Children&quot;, &quot;Red Scarf&quot;, &quot;Middle School Students&quot; and &quot;Youth Literature&quot;. Later, when I was older, I read &quot;Students&quot; published in the Republic of China. Youwenku&quot;. At that time, I read Lin Handa&#39;s &quot;New Collection of Stories from the Eastern Zhou Dynasty&quot;, &quot;New Collection of Stories from the Later and Later Han Dynasties&quot;, &quot;Stories of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, &quot;Tai Shi Not Afraid of Death&quot;, etc., and developed a strong interest in history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why did you apply in the end?

Roads, ditches, reservoirs, he often told me that after the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China, the motherland must be industrialized, and you should study engineering and work hard for modernization. My mother was a middle school teacher. During the anti-rightist movement in 1957, many liberal arts teachers in Tengchong No. 1 Middle School were misclassified. My mother said that we could not study liberal arts because it would be easy to make mistakes, so I always wanted to study science and engineering. Later, my mother also advocated that I study medicine because it would be useful at any time. In high school, I was good in all subjects, but I excelled in liberal arts. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I was a senior in high school in 1962. After the graduation exam last semester, the school divided us into three groups according to the subjects we applied for. One group was science and engineering. The other group is medicine and agriculture, and the other group is liberal arts. My family decided to choose science and engineering, but when it came to the specific subjects, I was assigned to the liberal arts group under the arrangement of the head teacher, Chinese teacher, and history teacher. At that time, I went to Baoshan, Yunnan to take the college entrance examination, and I sent out application letters before the exam. Each person can fill in five choices, so I filled out the history departments of Peking University, Renmin University of China, Nanjing University, Fudan and Yunda University, and was later admitted to Yunda University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why was Yunda University at that time Is the history department a &quot;five-year system&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Lin Chaomin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Our history department only had one major: history, and we recruited 32 people. Only one-half of the previous one, and one-third of the previous one. The curriculum arrangement is that the first, second and third grade students take basic courses, such as ancient literature, politics, foreign languages, Chinese and foreign general history, etc., and the fourth grade is divided into &quot;specialized (groups)&quot;. When I was studying, there were three special groups: Chinese national history, ancient Chinese economic history, and modern Chinese economic history. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I didn’t study well when I was in college. Since 1958, labor education has been relatively common in universities. The central government formulated the Sixty Articles for Higher Education, emphasizing the emphasis on teaching. At that time, the Ministry of Education stipulated that students should attend labor classes for five weeks in a school year, which implied that it could not exceed five weeks. But in reality it’s more than five weeks of labor each school year. At that time, Yunnan University had three farms, growing rice, corn, wheat, vegetables, as well as apple orchards and pig farms. In addition, there was a lot of public welfare work, such as planting trees in the mountains, and supporting spring plowing and autumn harvesting during busy farming periods. Later, when Kunming was building a railway station, we were asked to help. In 1961, after a survey, the Ministry of Higher Education found that students had to work and go to school at the same time, and could not learn much in four years, so they decided to turn key universities into five-year institutions, and Yunda University was also changed to a five-year institution. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You studied under Mr. Fang Guoyu when you were a graduate student because you went to Fang Sir&#39;s class? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lin Chaomin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When I was in college, Mr. Fang was responsible for the national task of compiling the southwest part of China’s historical map. He only teaches graduate students, and ethnic history is a senior professional course that is only taken in the fourth grade and is taught by his assistants Mr. You Zhong and Mr. Mu Qin. On April 20, 1963, Mr. Fang gave a speech on &quot;On the Integration of China&#39;s Historical Development&quot; at school. I met him for the first time, but because he was from Lijiang and of the Naxi ethnic group, he had a strong accent and I didn&#39;t understand much. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But I was deeply impressed after reading the article. In September 1966, when I was a senior in college, classes were suspended again due to the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, and the school began to engage in mass criticism to criticize reactionary academic authority. At that time, Yunnan University established a large criticism group, which included a Chinese group and a history group. The history group mainly criticized the &quot;three mountains&quot; of the history department. The first one was Fang Guoyu who &quot;represented&quot; feudalism, and the second one was &quot; Jiang Yingliang (who once served as county magistrate in Che, now Jinghong) represents &quot;bureaucratic capitalism&quot;, and the third one &quot;represents&quot; imperialism is Yang Kun (studied at the University of Sino-French in Lyon, France). There are five or six classmates in the history group I am in. The group members do not need to study in the department. Two young teachers organize us to go to these old gentlemen&#39;s books and find questions from the books. The average college student only has 6 library cards. , our criticism group has 20 library cards, and can go into the library to check books. It was also at this time that I dug out all of Mr. Fang&#39;s works and read them. His &quot;Inspection Notes on the Western Yunnan Border Area&quot; talked about his field trips to the Awa Mountains in the Lincang border area. I was very interested in reading it and felt that it was well written. Very good, no problems found. I didn’t write an article criticizing Mr. Fang. Instead, I learned about the social history of border areas and the customs and customs of ethnic minorities, and felt that his &quot;On the Integration of Chinese Historical Development&quot; and other articles were good articles for safeguarding national unity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Fang Guoyu (first from left) instructs Lin Chaomin (second from left), photographed in Professor Fang Guoyu&#39;s study in March 1973.

The more popular ones are in the modern history group. Every school has party history. Courses are in great demand for employment. Previously, all students majoring in modern history were assigned to the General Political Department of the People&#39;s Liberation Army. In addition, many people go to the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (now the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences). At that time, Yunda University&#39;s ethnic history major was ranked first in the country. Those who studied the history of Dai, Yi, Bai, and Naxi people in the Institute of Ethnology of the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences were all Yunda graduates. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Logically speaking, we should have graduated in July 1967, but until October 1968, except for a few in agriculture and medicine, our group of college students Except for majors, all were sent to farms to receive re-education and labor training. It was not until April 1970 that work began to be assigned. At that time, it was stipulated that college students should achieve &quot;four orientations&quot;, facing the grassroots, facing the countryside, facing the industry and mining, and facing the frontier. At the time of the distribution, no one wanted to go to Xishuangbanna. I read Mr. Fang&#39;s &quot;Inspection Notes on the Western Yunnan Border Region&quot;, Mr. Jiang Yingliang&#39;s &quot;Economic Life of the Paiyi&quot;, &quot;Life and Culture of the Paiyi&quot;, etc., and I was very interested in the border ethnic groups, so I Take the initiative to sign up to go to Xishuangbanna. In May 1970, when I arrived in Menghai County, Xishuangbanna, I was assigned to be a worker in the Menghai Tea Factory. I was transferred to the factory from time to time to write work summaries, publicity reports, etc. In 1972, Menghai No. 1 Middle School opened a high school and needed high school teachers, but the factory refused to let them go. It wasn’t until 1973 that I was transferred as a history and Chinese teacher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I heard you are When working at the Menghai Tea Factory, he was also appreciated by Professor Ren Jiyu of Peking University? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Lin Chaomin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I work 8 hours a day in the tea factory, and the rest of the time is my own. When I was in college, I was very interested in the history of Chinese thought. I read Hou Wailu&#39;s &quot;General History of Chinese Thought&quot;, Zhao Jibin&#39;s &quot;A New Exploration of the Analects&quot;, Guo Moruo&#39;s &quot;Ten Critiques&quot;, etc., and took notes. When I went to Menghai, I brought a copy of the &quot;Four Books&quot; with me. In his spare time, he wrote an article about Confucius&#39; thought and sent it to Professor Li Cuo in the department for his advice. He gave the article to Professor Zhang Deguang, an expert in the history of ancient Chinese thought, and Mr. Zhang recommended it to Ren Jiyu. Mr. Ren wrote me back a letter, saying that in a remote place like Xishuangbanna, it was not easy for me to persist in studying Confucius and write such an article. However, he also pointed out that my article did not criticize Confucius enough. Mr. Ren also sent me a copy of &quot;A Brief History of Chinese Philosophy&quot; edited by him. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1972, Mr. Ren wrote to me and told me that Peking University was preparing to recruit 10 graduate students in the history of Chinese philosophy. He hoped that I would be ready. Admitted to his graduate school. So I studied foreign languages ​​every day, systematically studied the history of Chinese philosophy, and often wrote to him for advice. But then the Zhang Tiesheng hand-in-the-blank incident happened, and Mr. Ren wrote to me to tell me that the recruitment of graduate students had been stopped, and that in the future, graduate students would also be recruited through the recommendation of workers, peasants and soldiers. I wouldn&#39;t have a chance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Until 1978, it was restored During the postgraduate enrollment period, you were finally able to take the postgraduate entrance examination, but why didn’t you contact Professor Ren Jiyu again? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lin Chaomin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I also thought about writing to Mr. Ren and doing research on the history of philosophy with him, but I was in Xishuangbanna at the time, and my thoughts changed.

Later, when I became a middle school teacher, some students asked me questions about ethnic minorities, and I couldn’t answer them. , at this time, I remembered the research on ethnic minorities by Mr. Fang Guoyu and Mr. Jiang Yingliang. I felt that there were more people doing the history of philosophy in the country, but too few people doing the history of ethnic groups, which was not popular, so I chose to study under Mr. Fang’s graduate school. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;In the 1960s, Lin Chaomin planted vegetables and watered vegetables at the PLA farm.

I read them one book at a time, but flipped through the bookshelves one by one. He asked me to start with bibliography and read books such as &quot;Summary of the General Catalog of All Siku&quot;, &quot;Diagnosis of Synopsis of Siku&quot; by Yu Jiaxi, and &quot;Answers to the Bibliography&quot; by Zhang Zhidong. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Mr. Fang has never criticized me directly. When I was studying for my master&#39;s degree, I wrote some small articles in &quot;Yunnan Daily&quot;. Mr. Fang just said, You haven&#39;t read enough books yet. What you posted in &quot;Yunnan Daily&quot; is just a trivial skill, building blocks. Your task is to build a tall building.

He does not advocate rushing to publish articles and believes that first Read good books. He said that no article should be refried, and if there is no new idea, don’t write an article. He said that some people nowadays do not study seriously, but are busy writing articles, rushing to publish articles, and eager for quick success. Many articles are about stir-fried twice-cooked pork. This won&#39;t work! Doctoral students do not use pigs raised by others to make steamed pork, Qianzhang pork, or braised pork. Instead, they have to cultivate new pig species themselves, create something, and invent something. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Later, I summarized doctoral studies as having all five &quot;unique&quot; aspects.

His study of border issues was not only In order to examine historical issues, but to maintain national unity and national unity. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1963, Mr. Fang published &quot;On the Integration of China&#39;s Historical Development&quot; and began to talk about the integrity of China&#39;s historical development. The article aims at the absurd remarks of some scholars at home and abroad who regard Chinese history as a single history of the Han people and exclude the history of non-Han Chinese ethnic minorities from Chinese history. It points out that the development of Chinese history has always been a whole, and that history and reality, the Central Plains and the Central Plains are The border areas, the Han and ethnic minorities, the Chinese nation, etc. are all one entity. Chinese history refers to the history of the people of all ethnic groups living on this land. It should include their entire history and cannot be &quot;changed or expanded.&quot; Chinese history has its own integrity. Within the whole, no matter how many regimes appear and no matter how inconsistent the politics, the whole has not been broken. China as a whole should be the scope of history, not the territory of past dynasties. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Later I assisted Mr. Fang in teaching the local history of Yunnan, and he reiterated this point of view in the introduction to &quot;Lecture Notes on the Local History of Yunnan&quot;. When Yunnan University celebrated its 70th anniversary in 1983, he guided me to write an article called &quot;Several Issues Related to the Thirty-seven Alliance Oath Monuments in Dali&quot;, which also used this monument to talk about the unification of Chinese history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From an international perspective , some historians may also hold other views on the unified view of history. How should we understand the border issue? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Lin Chaomin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Border issues are relatively complex. In the past, China had no border issues, only the relationship between China and the four barbarians, which meant the &quot;five-party republic&quot; between China and the four barbarians and &quot;the unification of the world, the seamless connection between China and barbarians&quot;. From the central to the local governments, they were one whole. Even during the period of division, both Han and ethnic minorities pursued &quot;unification of the world&quot; and regarded the dynasties they established as Chinese orthodoxy; the dynasty systems they established were based on inheriting the Qin and Han systems and did not change the overall Economic, political, and cultural structures. Because all ethnic groups have lived together for a long time, they have already formed a complementary and unified production and lifestyle, which has given birth to a very inclusive and absorbing Chinese civilization, allowing the Chinese nation to form a strong cohesion based on &quot;commonality&quot;. Even during the period of division, this way of production and life has not changed, the political system has not changed, the overall consciousness has not changed, and the culture has continued. This is reflected in the national outlook and national outlook as the &quot;grand unified&quot; national outlook and the overall consciousness of the Chinese nation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Modern frontier studies began to rise because of the arrival of Western colonialism from the East. The first is the political &quot;frontier&quot;. In history, the division and reunification of many places was a process of development. For example, Yunnan was Nanzhao in the Tang Dynasty. In the 10th year of Zhenyuan (794), the Yunnan Pacifying Department was established, and the Jiannan Jiedushi was appointed as the Yunnan Pacifying Envoy. It is an autonomous local government. Dali State was also an autonomous local government. Mongolia pacified Dali in 1253, and the Yuan Dynasty established a province in Yunnan in 1274. The Yuan Dynasty also established the province of Myanmar, which was later placed under the administration of Yunnan Province. It is a chieftain land under the jurisdiction of Yunnan Province. After the founding of New China, the China-Myanmar border was officially delimited in 1961. China erected the No. 1 boundary monument of the People&#39;s Republic of China on the border with Tengchong. Indicates that we formally respect the demarcation of borders under international law, that is, borders under international law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are also cultural borders. For example, the culture of the Wa people in China and the Wa state in northern Myanmar have many similarities. Although there are political boundaries at this time, But in fact, we all have the same culture and history, and we are a community with a shared future. Therefore, from a domestic perspective, it is the integrity of the Chinese nation, and from a foreign perspective, it should be regarded as a community. Domestically, we safeguard China&#39;s integrity and safeguard national unity. Internationally, we build a community with a shared future for mankind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Lin Chaomin&#39;s doctoral thesis is entitled &quot;Anbeiting Protectorate and the Western Frontier of the Tang Dynasty&quot;, taken in 1985.

Each department wants to generate income. Teachers in the Department of Economics and Foreign Languages, for example, can give lectures and tutors to earn extra money. Although the salary is the same, their extra money is several times that of ours. At that time, some teachers majoring in history said that they should think beyond the &quot;shit&quot; pit&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Students&#39; thoughts were not very stable, so I put forward a point of view. History may seem useless, but useless things are very useful. I told the students that the tables, chairs, benches, doors, windows, and lights in the classroom are all useful, but what is invisible and useless is the space. But without this space, there would be nowhere to put the tables, chairs, benches, and lights. History is human time and space. You can&#39;t see or touch it, but you can&#39;t live without it at all times. It&#39;s very useful anytime and anywhere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Later, the Ministry of Education proposed to build 10 &quot;bases&quot; in each of the three major categories of literature, history, and philosophy. When the document was issued to the school, it was less than the application deadline. For 5 days, I filled out the application form day and night, and stated at the review meeting that Yunnan University is a border university, inferior to Peking University, Fudan University, etc. in many aspects, but its research on border issues and ethnic issues is unique in the country and is related to national unity. , national unity, which is irreplaceable by other schools. The characteristics of the History Department of Yunda University are borderlands and ethnic groups, which cannot be replaced by any other school. In this way, in 1987, Yunda University became one of the 10 bases. The base class has brought new opportunities to Yunda University. The state invests 300,000 yuan in construction funds for the base class every year, and more than half of the students can be recommended to graduate school. Employment after graduation is no longer a problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Later, you also Did you encounter any difficulties in establishing the ethnology and social work majors? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Lin Chaomin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 1986, I proposed that Yunda University should establish an ethnology major, and the school leaders were very supportive. , reported to the Yunnan Provincial Education Commission, the Education Commission said that ethnology is run by the Nationalities College, and it is not appropriate to have two ethnology majors in one province. In the end, it was not completed. Later, I rewrote the report and applied to establish the anthropology major. In 1987, the State Education Commission approved Yunda to establish the anthropology major. We are the second anthropology major in a national university. The first one is Xiamen University, and the first one with an anthropology department is Sun Yat-sen University. In 1988, we enrolled the first batch of undergraduate students. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the Anthropology major was established in 1988, I began to plan to apply for the Sociology major. In July 1939, Wu Wenzao founded the Department of Sociology at Yunda University. By 1954, the Department of Sociology was abolished, and the head of the department at that time was Mr. Yang Kun. In 1984 and 1986, I visited Mr. Yang twice at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Mr. Yang repeatedly told me that it was wrong to abolish the Department of Sociology and that it should be restored and rebuilt as soon as possible. I brought his opinions back to school and reported them to the leaders. Although they were ignored, I always kept his words in mind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In October 1990, I visited the United States to study. I knew that social work is a major that is very needed by society. Social development will bring many problems and requires specialized professionals. Social workers come to the rescue. Both rich and poor have social problems. When I passed through Hong Kong when I returned to China, I went to some universities to learn about the social work major. One of their social work features is to help disadvantaged groups, the poor, the unemployed, the disabled, etc. After I came back, I told the school that if the sociology major could not be offered, we would not be able to offer it. Social work major. At that time, most people in the academic affairs office of the school did not know what social work was, so I explained it over and over again. After the school agreed, it was reported to the Provincial Education Commission and the National Education Commission, and it was quickly approved.

Just like air, we can&#39;t see or touch it, but we can&#39;t live without it for a moment. We study history in order to create the future. To move forward, we can only ask about history; only by learning from history can we create the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend intern Huang Xiaoying also contributed to this article)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; /p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https:// feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 26 Nov 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[徐卓媛：因为喜爱去攀登]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261243]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-26 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/22/jlh4uLkDEV5I0wjzaQur3Al4838vctWvTfIIMEXL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;719&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/jlh4uLkDEV5I0wjzaQur3Al4838vctWv TfIIMEXL. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259209&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Picture from Honor 100 series Shooting/picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In mid -May 2023, after nearly 10 hours of difficult climbing, Changsha girl Xu Zhuoyuan successfully reached Mount Everest. Four years ago, she shouted &quot;I want to board Mount Everest&quot; in a variety show. Four years later, at the age of 16, she fulfilled her promise with practical actions and became the youngest in China who reached the top of Mount Everest from the southern slope. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Affected by his father, Xu Zhuoyuan began to contact climbing when he was very young. When she was 4 years old, her parents took her to climb the Simuashan, and unexpectedly found that she had a good adaptation to Gao. At the age of 12, she traveled to Tibet with her father Xu Jianglei. At that time, she regretted that she did not see Everest&#39;s sunrise due to the weather. On the way back, she climbed the Dafeng of Simuashan with her father. &quot;It was the first time that I really climbed a snowy mountain.&quot; Since then, the desire to climb the peak. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Mountaineering is the extreme movement of Xiang Yang&#39;s luck. Since the contact with climbing, her emotions have become more stable. P>; This climbing six months ago was Xu Zhuoyuan&#39;s first challenge to Mount Everest. Before the start, she installed her father Xu Jianglei&#39;s gloves to the top of Mount Everest, hoping as &quot;a kind of inheritance.&quot; In 2007, Xu Jianglei reached the top of Mount Everest and became the first person in Hunan Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When Xu Zhuoyuan remembers that he was approaching the peak, the Charba guide beside him reminded her to reach the top. On the sunrise, my father&#39;s top photos have been impressed. In the photo, he was full of style, and he laughed very brightly in the sun. I can feel his love for the snowy mountains. That photo is still on my house so far Fortunately, the sun came out almost at the moment she reached the summit. Now, the photos of her father are discharged by the photos she reached, and behind her is the rising sun. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &quot;I want to climb Mount Everest&quot; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: Kai style, Kai style_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot; &quot;&quot; >; At the age of 12, you said &quot;I want to board Mount Everest&quot; in a program.

On the summer when I graduated from a 12 -year -old elementary school, my dad took me into Tibet, but at the time, I didn&#39;t see Rizhao Jinshan because of the weather. Later, my father and I went to climb the Dafeng of Simuashan together. This is the first time I really climbed a snowy mountain. At that time, the mountain was snowing. As a southerner, I felt very novel. Since then, I have very much hope to have the opportunity to climb Everest to watch the sunrise. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: Kai style, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; After the target of 12 years old, Dad dad was after the target of 12 years old, Dad&#39;s father, his father, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad.

My current high school school task is very heavy, and the training tasks of mountaineering are also very heavy, so I will fill all my free time and learn in advance in the original progress. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; The summit is not successful, home is &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: Kai style _Gb2312, stkaiti; &quot;>; What is your mood when you reach the top of Mount Everest? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Xu Zhuoyuan: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; I thought I would be very excited. Cold is still some emotions that can compress people in high altitude. I am actually quite calm. I remember I took the banner in the bag one by one, and then called my mother to report to peace. Because the weather was too bad and the blizzard was very heavy, the guide of Charba urged me to retreat quickly, and I thought about it to withdraw. At that time, my parents suggested that I stay at Camp No. 2 for another day, and the next day I took the helicopter to withdraw from the Everest Base Camp. But I stayed on the mountain for 8 days, and there were no baths and no Internet in 8 days. This has reached the limit for me. I threw the sleeping bag and moisture -proof pad to Camp No. 4. , So I took it for 22 hours that day. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;除了不能洗澡，作为女生，你在What difficulties do you encounter during the climbing process? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Xu Zhuoyuan: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; In fact, women are more inconvenient than men when climbing, such as washing and going to the toilet.

If the road repair team was not repaired at the time, we might have to withdraw from the Everest Base Camp and wait for the next cycle. For the rest, I will chat with the teammates of the mountaineering team and play playing cards, and I will resist high. I just spit out the night when I arrived at the Everest Camp. I don&#39;t know if it was because I was dissatisfied with the soil and water in Nepal. It took about two days to recover. Later, I was trained by my teammates alone in the base camp.

While he felt humiliated, he was very excited. He opened the first page of the computer document and increased the font size to say &quot;the error of the river&quot;. The following two lines of small characters, the original book: Yu Hua, director: Wei Shujun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He wants to adapt the novel published in 1988. The crimes of the three murderers pointed at the lunatic, but the unable to build a complete evidence chain to make him rope to make him, causing the town and the criminal police captain Ma Zhe to be uneasy. The writer Yu Hua imitated the detective novels during the Pioneer Literature period, using violence and absurdity as the skin, and subverting the tradition as the bone phase. After selling the copyright several times, it has not been changed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is difficult to find a word, pointing to the philosophy behind all suspenseful talks. In 2021, Wei Shujun and the screenwriter Kang Chunlei adapted to the second year. After overturning the direction twice, he decided to find the word. They looked for two days and two nights, turned around in the room, and had eyebrows. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;BUG.&quot; He was quite satisfied with this new progress. &quot;It is a word born of information technology progress. Isn&#39;t our &quot;Yong&#39;an Town Story Collection&quot; called &#39;Ripples of Life&#39;, this is called &#39;Bugs of Life&#39;. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; In August 2021, Wei Shujun was filming a new film in the northeast in the northeast &quot;White Crane Bright Wings&quot;. After work, the crew will play badminton together. However, the indoor venue was closed due to the new crown epidemic, and they were going to change the basketball outdoors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; One month ago, his second minister film &quot;Yong&#39;an Town Story Collection&quot; was selected into the Cannes Film Festival Director&#39;s Double Week unit; one year ago, it was nominated for the newly -headed film &quot;Mustang Divide&quot; in Cannes. Director of the long film, and then the graduate graduation work &quot;Yanbian Youth&quot; won the Cannes short film special mention of the award -it was well received by the first appearance. sex. Wei Shujun has attracted much attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, the adaptation of &quot;Error by the River&quot; quickly fell into another strange circle. BUG does not exist alone. It is necessary to describe rational loopholes and out of control. The premise is to explain what rationality is, and the rational argument is a widely covered, academic discussion, and consumes energy and unnecessary. &quot;We found another direction,&quot; we had to give up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Occasionally, during the survey of Hangzhou, Wei Shujun felt that there should be a dream at the end of the story. &quot;Not completely linked their cause of death at the rational level and cannot serve the case of disconnection. But in dreams, they seem to be established, and they all seem to be established. In a series of accidentality, it reveals some inevitability and gives people a creepy feeling.&quot; In the final version of the script, the dream became the core paragraph. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This seems to be his usual way of creating, pay attention to the true feelings of the creative subject, and perform effective expression in the movie. Cheng Ma, who has worked with him three times, provided evidence: &quot;We are basically created by feeling.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Cheng Ma and Wei Shujun met in Shanghai for the first time in three years. . Regarding the concept of film and creative, they have a lot of consensus. The two of them are simple but very important: at the beginning of the movie, to create &quot;realistic hallucinations&quot;, and so far, the movie may not be the best storytelling story. Media, but it is a passage for the feelings of the creators. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For example, about the errors on the river, Wei Shujun told Cheng Ma that it is restrained, quiet, elegant, and many things happen in humid rainy days. This is the feeling of his novels. Correspondingly, Cheng Ma feels that in the 1990s, the character&#39;s free and incompatible with the geographical characteristics of the character of the characters are far away, not near. Cheng Ma suggested to use 16mm films to shoot, and they immediately took a shot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In November 2022, there were 45 days after leaving shooting. The actors were busy with each other, and Lin Kai got to practice splitting and punching punch. Zhu Yilong wore a leather jacket and a local police to visit. pregnant woman. The crew cooks together, watch movies, and play badminton. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;I think the best state of creation is that all the main creators are relaxed. I don&#39;t like the night sustaining day (status) that is very nervous and like to repair the project. At work, but still have your own order of life, you still have your pursuit of beauty and enthusiasm for life. &quot;Wei Shujun said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He often carries a film machine with him -the crew adds up to 20 film cameras, and even a dark room with black and white photos was born -the daily life of the crew. There are more in his mobile phone album. Open it to see it. Friends meet, travel is the scenery, river, tree, and sea. &quot;It seems to have some kind of ability to leave time, remind you that it is a pleasant In the afternoon, a happy state. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Sasculation is rare, and it is also rare that in Cheng Ma&#39;s words, Wei Shujun puts the need for creation very high. &quot;As a director of this age, he can actually carry a lot of pressure. We have to take a shot. Many people say what to do with the scene and what to do with actors. For example, there are many plays in a certain character, but the actors can only come in total for 10 days for 10 days. Usually the crew&#39;s approach is to focus on his play in these 10 days. But Wei Shujun feels that the value of the publicity is very valuable to his creation, and he will give up the scenes that are not suitable for the actors and time that can&#39;t be matched. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Kang Chunlei also said: &quot;I think he has a close -intuitive control ability at the scene. I have always told him that you are shining at the scene.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Also Once, Wei Shujun changed his role name on the spot. In the novel, Ma Zhe&#39;s hand is Xiao Li, a young man who took the initiative to report the case from time to time. Then, of course, Ling Linkai is called Xiao Li. After taking a few days, Wei Shujun suddenly said that this is too thanks to &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; (&quot;thanks&quot; refers to shit) &lt;/span>; Just call Xiao Xie. Wei Shujun greeted other actors and modified the lines. The printed Xiao Li&#39;s police officer&#39;s certificate was re -posted. The role of Qi Linkai became Xiaoxie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, the feelings at the scene are not so wonderful. Wei Shujun&#39;s own version is: &quot;When you imagine that when you were going to school before, you had to sit in the classroom at 7 am every day in the classroom and learn from himself. After eating breakfast at home, I felt that I was still awake. No, I did n’t write it quickly, I felt very practical when I wrote, and I started to want to go to the small sales department to buy some to eat during the class, and then I really listened to the teacher. Okay, then start drinking water, walk around the scene, the actors are almost the same, then discuss the scene, determine our scheduling with the photography, everyone prepares, and then start preparing to shoot. Adjust, take a pat, have a good, feel, take another shot, this is the meal at noon. It really feels. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>;&quot; There is a slope every day, you have You can get to that (creation) that position. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>;&quot; Error by the River &quot;is completed accurately and efficiently, and the&quot; Follow &quot;unit of the Cannes Film Festival is shortlisted. Five months later, two honors were won at the Pingyao International Film Exhibition. After another four days, it was released throughout the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At the end of the film, the theater often sounds discussions. Wei Shujun used a long dream to let Ma Zhe disclose herself to solve his own anxiety and chaos. The dream is clear, coherent but not logical. After seeing everyone&#39;s death by the river, Ma Zhe sat on the old seat of the movie theater and saw the director on the big screen holding a table tennis printed with numbers 3, shouting to him madly to him —— Ma Zhe! Third class merit! In this lens that overlapped the consequences and prophecy, thousands of table tennis rolled down from below the screen and flushed to Ma Zhe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Everyone was very excited when shooting. After taking one, everyone was full of the thousands of table tennis while shouting, &quot;Let&#39;s come again and one after another.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The audience&#39;s doubts and endless interpretations and comments on movies have formed multiple dreams outside the screen. One is &quot;rational and irrational. &quot;Effect&quot;. From this perspective, Wei Shujun&#39;s uneasiness of the novels, the inquiry of the creator&#39;s intention, and the several times of adaptation of the creator&#39;s intention were passed on to the audience. We thought that the answer was obtained, and the illusion was actually obtained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;I am not very obsessed with what is pursuing the truth in life, because I don&#39;t think I can find it.&quot; Cheng Ma said that this is another consensus between him and Wei Shujun. The destiny is a random existence. You can only see existence, and you don&#39;t know what the truth behind it. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; The existential tendency of existentialism with&quot; errors by the river &quot;is trying to do Back to &quot;exist in the essence of the essence&quot;, or &quot;back to the thing itself&quot;. Just reiterate, &quot;I think I &lt;span style =&quot; font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti; &quot;>; (creator) &lt;/span>; determine the only right to interpret, and allow the audience to accept this explanation Power, this is the biggest paradox. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; After the movie was released, Wei Shujun sent a message to Yu Hua and said that we didn&#39;t seem to use a movie to write a note for the novel. After reading. For a while, they were keen on sharing the audience&#39;s interpretation of the audience&#39;s interpretation of the movie, including a test papers of &quot;Yu Hua and who I understand the errors by the river&quot; errors by the river &quot;.

As a tribute to the centenary, &quot;Star Wish&quot; certainly closely follows this theme. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The background of the movie is set in a kingdom of wishes called Rosas. People come from all directions to offer their dreams to the magical King Manifico, and the king will choose the right person from them. Help them achieve it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The heroine Yasha’s biggest wish is that her grandfather’s dream comes true. However, when she came into contact with King Manifico, she realized that &lt;span>; the king was not as kind and generous as he appeared on the surface. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/13d838d9212ca2dcc2eb87255e9f04b0.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/13d838d9212ca2dcc2eb87255e9f04b0.png&quot; data-key=&quot;259601 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Manifico is an extreme conservative. He will only select dreams that he considers harmless to realize, while shelving creative dreams. He regarded such dreams as a scourge that would shake Rosas&#39;s foundations. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Of course Asha disagrees with the king&#39;s point of view, so she joins forces with the wishing star and Valentino the goat to try to get her grandfather&#39;s dream back.

And &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;No matter what the situation, Asha was always loyal to her heart, &lt;/span>; and won more allies, and finally overthrew Manifico&#39;s rule. The dystopian nature of the movie is very un-Disney. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I don&#39;t agree with your point of view, but I will defend to the death your right to speak.&quot; Putting it here is an excellent comment. Everyone has the right to pursue their dreams, and the king cannot deny it easily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to being good at creating dreams, Disney is also good at creating princesses. Since the release of Snow White (Disney&#39;s first animated feature film &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;) in 1937, Disney has followed the development of the times for more than 80 years and successively launched more than a dozen characters.

Later princesses have improved their initiative and self-awareness. For example, Ariel in &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1989) sacrifices singing to walk on land in order to meet the man she loves; Ariel in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991) Belle and the ugly beast have been in love for a long time; Jasmine in &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992) &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; refuses the king&#39;s offer Referring to marriage, falling in love with Aladdin. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;The princesses of this period&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; will take the initiative to fight for what they want, but&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; Their goal in life is still to find true love. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/631f8f80da83892c3fea154bbfc85969.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;669&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/631f8f80da83892c3fea154bbfc85969.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259603 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Such &quot;progress&quot; was obviously not enough.

The family relationship between the two sisters became the main thread, and the handsome prince became the villain of the entire film. The princess no longer passively waits for the prince to save her, the princess herself is very powerful; true love no longer involves the prince kissing the princess, and the sisterhood is also very touching. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/c1da20b56f8dbd4531cb0b088ba7c214.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;418&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/c1da20b56f8dbd4531cb0b088ba7c214.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259606 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It can be said that Disney subverted Disney. Starting from this&lt;/span>;movie, Disney princesses completely got rid of the male gaze. They took off their costumes and became their own heroes. Like the &lt;span>; princesses in &quot;Moana&quot; (2016) and &quot;Legend of the Dragon&quot; (2021), they all gave up on romance. One lived her life how she wanted, and the other led her people to protect their home and country. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/0c8e54ba1a97dd0ceb9f0f15dd4a0e8d.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;224&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/0c8e54ba1a97dd0ceb9f0f15dd4a0e8d.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;259607 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;And this &quot;Star Wish&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; is also of the same origin&lt;/span>;. Asha dares to question and is not afraid of power. In order to protect all the residents of Rosas He did not hesitate to stand on the opposite side of King Manifico. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But compared with the previous princesses, Asha&#39;s combat effectiveness is obviously weakened. She no longer has the ability to go to heaven and earth. She is more like an ordinary person, a civilian hero who resists the aloof king. Just like the theme song of the movie sings, &quot;Maybe you are afraid but you still reach out your hand, and you will not run away because of a weak tremor.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This may also be the century-old road that Disney has walked for itself.

Each one has a story that is compelling and extraordinary. But Yi Mengling’s story clearly does not fall into this category. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to define Yi Mengling seems to be an issue that the public is more interested in now. She is a model, a blogger, an Internet celebrity, and a newcomer to the film and television industry. And Yi Mengling is still making a lot of attempts and challenges. Maybe there will be more labels and identities added to her name in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is widely known because of Yi Mengling’s unique style of photos and short videos. With good aesthetics, makeup and outfits, coupled with sunshine, smile and always bright attitude, Yi Mengling has gained tens of millions of fans on social platforms. She didn&#39;t take the initiative to define anything, but various labels followed, such as &quot;a sense of atmosphere&quot; and &quot;a sense of pure desire&quot;...these labels were either envy, love, or ill-intentioned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the day of the interview, this thin girl who attracted too much attention walked up to the filming site on the second floor and greeted everyone who came her way. During the shooting break, she skillfully communicated with the photographer about technical issues, &quot;You have to trust me.&quot; When discussing a certain lighting technique, she sincerely gave her suggestions, which made the photographer laugh out loud. laugh. Yi Mengling had not eaten anything from morning to noon. When the accompanying staff hurriedly delivered the takeaway during the break, she said, &quot;Just a few bites&quot; and &quot;call me when you are ready.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This may be a more realistic look of Yi Mengling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a long time, some people imitated her, some people disdained her, and there were more and more discussions about her. However, Yi Mengling rarely fought with netizens, and she still only exported life related to herself. Fragment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She also occasionally responds to some controversial discussions. For example, &quot;Big Mouth&quot; brings a signature smile, but also brings ridicule. Yi Mengling&#39;s response is more of self-acceptance and gratitude, which makes her unique in the field of modeling. For example, after recording her first experience in acting and variety shows, netizens compared her with female celebrities because of her acting skills and appearance. More comments about &quot;Internet celebrities should not enter the entertainment industry&quot; followed. But in Yi Mengling&#39;s view, she treats the world as a big playground and is an experiential player. It takes courage to try different things and challenge different things, but she thinks the process of taking the challenge is cool, and she is also cool if she chooses to challenge herself. &quot;No matter what the result is, it is all experience. I think it is worth it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone likes Yi Mengling. In addition to her beauty, they also like her calm personality. Many times, she is trying her best to relieve some anxiety and output some positive energy. For example, she appeared without makeup, shared her tips behind taking photos, and posted photos of her belly with meat after meals, making everyone feel that beauty is not a statue, but a living person. Similarly, such behavior will still cause dissatisfaction. Some people feel that this is deliberate or a &quot;concave and down-to-earth persona&quot;. No matter what she said, Yi Mengling accepted it all. In her opinion, she actually has nothing to be taboo about. As a public figure, it is essential to face criticism. Many of the things others said were exaggerated, so just laugh after reading them. Yi Mengling said: &quot;Try not to fall into the vicious circle of self-evidence. After all, explanations are never-ending.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She is an amateur and has a place on the Internet with her own advantages. It seems that all internet celebrities can be found in her, but she cannot be classified into the same category as anyone. Yi Mengling&#39;s story may not be complicated, but no matter what, she fought her way out of the siege in a place where the fighting was more intense. To a certain extent, whether the public recognizes it or not, she has courage, tenacity and strength beyond her age. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About an ordinary girl becoming the focus of the spotlight, how does she face all this? The following is Yi Mengling’s answer. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Rather than being self-consistent, it is better to say that I am trying to find growth here&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font- family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Do you still remember the turning points that you think are important?

As soon as they entered the outpatient hall of the hospital, the crowds and the hot air made the patients who were already sick inevitably feel even more depressed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thanks to the medical insurance code (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;i.e. &quot;medical insurance electronic voucher&quot; &lt;/span>;), even if you are affiliated with Zhejiang University The First Hospital has more than 7 million outpatient visits a year, and the outpatient hall &quot;will not seem so crowded.&quot; &quot;Patients will settle the registration fees through the mini program through medical insurance in advance and report online. After the treatment, they will directly settle the medical insurance fees through the mini program.&quot; Qiu Yunqing told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data provided by Qiu Yunqing shows that patients can complete the entire medical process by holding the medical insurance code, which significantly improves the efficiency of patient treatment and hospital operation efficiency. In 2023, the settlement rate of the medical insurance code of Zhejiang University First Hospital will reach 45.67 %. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Same as the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, 31 provinces across the country (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;Municipality and autonomous region&lt;/span>;) and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps have supported medical insurance codes for medical treatment and drug purchase, with access to more than 800,000 designated medical institutions and more than 1 billion users of medical insurance codes. At the press conference of the National Medical Insurance Administration on November 24, 2023, Fu Chaoqi, deputy director of the National Medical Insurance Administration Office, provided the above data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fu Chaoqi pointed out that judging from the activation status of medical insurance codes in various provinces, Zhejiang and Qinghai provinces have taken the lead in achieving coverage of insured persons in the province, and the activation rate of medical insurance codes in more than half of the provinces exceeds 75%. Data from Tencent Health Calculation shows that for an ordinary insured person, he can make an appointment through the WeChat public account before seeing a doctor, and use the medical insurance code to complete online medical insurance payment during settlement, saving an average of 43 minutes for each patient. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Break barriers and use the whole process of medical treatment and drug purchase&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When purchasing drugs in hospitals and pharmacies, the &quot;bright code&quot; on the mobile phone can be traced back to four years ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 24, 2019, the first medical insurance code (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;Medical Insurance Electronic Voucher&lt;/span>;) was launched in Shandong Jinan City, Province, is activated. At that time, the National Medical Insurance Administration hoped that the medical insurance code would not only be simply electronic, but also realize the vision of &quot;seeing a doctor without a card, only using the medical insurance code&quot;, with unified standards across the country, cross-regional mutual recognition, and one electronic voucher. All medical insurance business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Four years later, these visions have not only been gradually implemented, but also new attempts are being made. Take Zhejiang Province as an example. In the past, there were 54 medical insurance systems in Zhejiang, which were separated from each other and not shared with each other. Until March 2022, Zhejiang Province’s “Smart Medical Insurance” system will be fully connected to the national medical insurance platform, realizing the unified medical insurance settlement in Zhejiang Province. system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cao Cen, deputy director of the Zhejiang Medical Insurance Bureau, said that Zhejiang requires all designated medical institutions to transform their HIS (hospital information management system) to support the use of medical insurance codes throughout the process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, in Zhejiang Provincial Hospital, everything from registration, medical treatment, payment, inspection and testing, printing reports, to getting medicines, handling hospitalization and medical insurance settlement and other services can be completed by just scanning the QR code; in pharmacies, , the medical insurance code supports prescription circulation, drug purchase and dispensing, and medical insurance settlement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The medical insurance code also breaks down the barriers inside and outside the hospital. Jinhua Central Hospital of Zhejiang Province mentioned in a paper that by applying medical insurance codes to achieve electronic prescription circulation, patients can choose &quot;dual channels&quot; (through two channels, designated medical institutions and designated retail pharmacies, and be included in medical insurance payment simultaneously if conditions are met) ) Purchase prescription drugs at designated retail pharmacies and enjoy the same reimbursement treatment as those at hospitals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The service scenario has changed from ‘single point’ to ‘full process’.” Xie Zhangshu, deputy director of the Department of Regulation, Finance and Law of the National Medical Insurance Administration, said that the application of medical insurance codes for the entire process of medical treatment and drug purchase is a key task of the medical insurance department in 2023 One is to promote the medical insurance code from being only available in the settlement process to being used in the entire process of appointment registration, sign-in for medical treatment, diagnosis and treatment, report inquiry, and pharmacy retrieval. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Families work together to make it convenient for the elderly and children&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Most of the patients in the hospital are elderly, so it is particularly important for modern technology to take into account the needs of the elderly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A paper from the Zhejiang Provincial Cancer Hospital mentioned that the average age of medical insurance patients in Hangzhou in 2021 is 55 years old, of which about 40% are patients aged 60 and above. “On the one hand, elderly patients are smart The usage rate of mobile phones is low; on the other hand, compared with young people, elderly patients are less proficient and fluent in using smartphones.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of aging-friendly transformation, WeChat Medical Insurance Code has launched an accessible version to support visually impaired people to use the medical insurance code through voice. At the same time, family account services have been launched in many provinces, and facial recognition and other technologies have been applied to support relatives. Agency business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Yunqing told Southern Weekend reporters that most elderly people are accompanied by their family members when they seek medical treatment. Through the medical insurance family account function, accompanying family members can bind the elderly person’s medical insurance code to their own accounts to facilitate appointments and payments for the elderly. cost. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, according to the medical insurance policies of Zhejiang and other places, the balance of the personal account of the insured person over the years can be used to directly pay the spouse who participates in the basic medical insurance in the same coordinating area in the province through the &quot;Family Mutual Aid Filing&quot; , children and parents’ medical insurance expenses. For example, if a young person’s personal account is not used up, they can give it to their parents. “(&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;Parents&lt;/span>;) prepare a medicine today. The medical insurance will just send you a text message to tell you what medicine was prescribed and how much it cost. It is also very convenient after binding, and you can use the money from your personal account to pay your relatives.&quot; Qiu Yunqing said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We have also paid attention to the medical insurance service needs of some groups such as the elderly and minors who have difficulty using smart technology. We have effectively integrated traditional services with smart methods, launched family accounts, and registered on behalf of others for medical treatment in other places. function, and added the service of offline activation of medical insurance codes in medical insurance agencies to help special groups obtain and enjoy mobile medical insurance services and improve the accessibility of convenient medical insurance services.&quot; Xie Zhangshu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Be wary of fraudulent use of medical insurance codes to ensure the safety of medical insurance funds&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;However, while medical insurance codes are convenient, how to ensure the safety of medical insurance funds also brings challenges to all parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Guangzhou Medical Insurance Service Center pointed out in a paper that the medical insurance electronic voucher does not currently have the photo information of the insured person, and it is difficult to verify whether the person who holds the medical code is the insured person when seeking medical treatment, which is a problem for the medical insurance fund. Supervision brings difficulties and challenges. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2023, Putian police detected a case of fraudulent use of medical insurance codes. After a villager died, his relatives fraudulently used the medical insurance codes to seek medical reimbursement, defrauding the medical insurance fund of 1,232.73 yuan, and was eventually sentenced to three days of administrative detention. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Zhang Junjie, general manager of Alipay’s medical and health division, said that the system will conduct multi-factor security technical analysis on the insured’s usage habits, account changes and other information. Once an abnormality is discovered, it will be immediately reported to the Medical Insurance Bureau and the risk control system will be activated. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2023, the National Medical Insurance Administration issued the &quot;Work Plan for &quot;Two Combinations and Three Empowerments&quot; of Medical Insurance Data, which requires vertical and horizontal integration of medical insurance data to achieve comprehensive supervision of medical insurance funds. The National Medical Insurance Administration also requires that all coordinating regions will launch an intelligent supervision subsystem by the end of 2023. By the end of 2025, an intelligent audit and electronic monitoring system will be basically established, and the &quot;medical insurance code&quot; will be used to allow users, medical institutions, insurance handling units, and pharmaceutical and device companies to The data are closely connected to form a normalized supervision system that handles daily audits and on-site inspections, big data analysis, full-scenario intelligent monitoring and other methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After the medical insurance code users broke 1 billion, the National Medical Insurance Bureau was also promoting the service function of the medical insurance code from &quot;available&quot; to &quot;easy to use&quot;. &quot;Currently, the public&#39;s demand for medical insurance services is multi-layered, diversified, and personalized. Based on the actual needs of the people, the medical insurance department has launched a number of &#39;Internet + medical insurance services&#39; that are easy to use and popular with the public, such as online inquiries Medical consultation, one-click prescription refill, follow-up prescription dispensing, online settlement, home delivery of medicine, etc., to better meet the people’s needs for medical treatment and drug purchase.” said Xie Zhangshu, deputy director of the Department of Regulation, Finance and Law of the National Medical Insurance Administration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend intern Xi Lijie also contributed)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p >;</description><pubDate> Sat, 25 Nov 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[父亲带脑梗儿子跑网约车感动万千网友：灵活就业让赚钱与陪伴得以两全]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261194]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-25 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;This is news that will make all middle-aged fathers feel sad after reading it. In Chongqing, Yi Heping, a 53-year-old online ride-hailing driver, takes his son who has suffered a cerebral infarction every day. Every time he takes an order, he will apologize to the passenger first: &quot;I&#39;m sorry, the co-pilot is my son, he is sick...&quot; In September this year, the media mentioned that he had apologized more than 1,800 times. It is estimated that this data will continue to increase. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;His son is unfortunate. In 2021, Yi Heping&#39;s son was admitted to the hospital due to cerebral infarction; in early 2023, Xiao Yi was sent to the emergency room again due to cerebral hemorrhage. After treatment, Xiao Yi&#39;s physical condition gradually recovered, but he lost his ability to take care of himself. In order to better take care of his son, Yi Heping took Xiao Yi &quot;on the road&quot; with him. He has experienced order cancellations and has been understood and cared for by more passengers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As far as Yi Heping&#39;s destiny and personality are concerned, he has two &quot;facets&quot;. One is a loser in the ups and downs of the business world. Yi Heping used to be &quot;Boss Yi&quot;. In 1996, he went to Shenzhen to start a business and became one of the first people to operate communication equipment. He then entered the construction industry and logistics business... After getting tired of the life of attending various business banquets every day , he decided to return to his hometown and start a business in Chongqing. At that time, he still had more than 20 million yuan in his personal account, and he had everything from villas to luxury cars, as well as his own full-time driver. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2015, Yi Heping’s investment failed, leading to the company’s bankruptcy, and years of hard work came to nothing in the blink of an eye. This trajectory is desolate and sad, filled with the frustration of a middle-aged man; the other is a father who is struggling between earning money to support the family and taking care of his son. The wife is unable to take care of her son due to diabetes, coronary heart disease, etc. This burden can only be shouldered by the tired father. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such a story is of course an &quot;only copy&quot;, but Yi Heping is not the only one who takes his children or relatives &quot;on the road&quot; to make a living. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, Anhui takeaway boy Li Yuanyuan put Fei&#39;er, who was only six months old, in a takeout box to deliver takeout, which attracted attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2022, the media reported that Xiao Xin, a young man from Guizhou, took his 3-year-old son to deliver food. Life was not good to him, divorced, having a second child, raising a baby, and working hard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, a video with 100,000+ views and comments, &quot;Encountering the Inspiring Mother of the Post-000&quot;, attracted attention. The mother in the video, whose husband died in an accident, was still less than one year old and was pulling alone. child and took her to deliver food. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2023, Modern Express reported that Fu Zhenyang, a &quot;bald uncle&quot; from Lu&#39;an, Anhui, started driving a sports car in Suzhou with his sick wife in 2017, and he has been running for 6 years. Fu Zhenyang wants to pay more than 200,000 yuan in debt, and also take care of the half -paralyzed wife. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No need to give examples one by one. What these stories have in common is that most of the protagonists came to the city from rural areas to work hard. They all encountered huge twists and turns in life, and they all chose not to abandon or give up. They struggled to withstand the heavy pressure and endless tests of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The direct reason for their difficulty is that they are far away from their family areas and blood ties. The strong and optimistic post-00s mother was ruthlessly pushed out of the house by her mother-in-law. More often than not, some people had to come to big cities to make a living in order to change their circumstances. Obviously, in a rural and family context, when a person has difficulties, others can help him. When you go to work, someone can help you take care of your children. When you fall ill, someone brings hot meals to your home. This reflects your inability to a large extent. But after coming to the city to work alone, all the &quot;reinforcements&quot; disappeared. In a situation where the neighbors &quot;don&#39;t know each other&quot;, the only one you can rely on is yourself. The first thing you do when you wake up every day is to think about your loved ones who rely on you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What they encountered was essentially &quot;atomization.&quot; As experts say, social atomization mainly refers to the process of changes in the state of social connection during the change of unit systems. Mainly manifested by phenomena such as the weakening of connections between individuals and the alienation of individuals from the public world. These busy situations every day are exactly the realistic portrayal of the &quot;post-work unit&quot; and lonely individuals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They are actually on an isolated island, isolated and helpless, and are not even qualified to fall down. What Yi Heping is most worried about is what will happen to his son once he is no longer there. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Earning money and companionship are both important and cannot be given up, but how to have both is a problem. Obviously, it is difficult for them to enter a &quot;regular unit&quot; in the secular sense and clock in from nine to five. Even if they have the ability, the fact that they need to care for a loved one who cannot care for themselves will discourage them from working. What&#39;s more, almost no unit will allow employees to bring their children or wives to work. Regardless of the company&#39;s system or order, it will say &quot;no&quot; to this situation. After all, the employer has no such obligation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, they have found a place to stay in the flexible employment sector. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the realistic situation of the bone, the &quot;dilemma&quot; hanging on their heads forced them to find another law. The rise of platform employment and freelancing has given them great hope. This is a way of working where you don’t need to clock in and you can use your time freely. It can be said that the Internet economy, including the takeout economy, provides the final guarantee for this group of people. What is shown behind this is actually a new way of thinking developed by a society to help solve the practical difficulties of a certain group of people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this group, this is the only way for them to break the &quot;atomized&quot; state and get out of the predicament. Only those who desperately fight against misfortune and hardship can find this arduous but practical path. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, those wanderers who take their children &quot;on the road&quot; also set an example for their children to persevere and shine in the face of adversity. Children who have this life course are better able to appreciate the true meaning of life, and will become sensible earlier than their peers. A recent video posted online showed that a mother with paralysis of her lower limbs accidentally fell down while getting into a wheelchair in Yan&#39;an, Shaanxi Province. Her 4-year-old son tried his best to help her up again and again. On November 14, Li Yuanyuan posted a video on the video platform of her three-year-old daughter Fei&#39;er helping to wash the dishes, which once again sparked discussion among netizens. Netizens called the little girl&#39;s &quot;smile so healing.&quot; Enduring hardship is also the best tutor. I firmly believe that those who run around with their children in the streets have also done a good job in raising their children psychologically. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While we are exploring social assistance mechanisms to protect groups in need, we should also see the extraordinary significance of ordinary people gritting their teeth to shoulder the burden of a family and holding up an umbrella to protect their loved ones. This kind of narrative seems to be sporadic, scattered and atypical, but through the &quot;symphony of destiny&quot; of many individuals, it gathers a vivid sample of fighting uncertainty and dissatisfaction, becoming a society in the process of dissolving &quot;atomization&quot;. &quot;An indispensable force in the situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 25 Nov 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[成长的烦恼：中国电子竞技20年观察]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261254]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-25 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/22/t1G2je6q32XCmPWjVlGVou4ntF4YHClLlLAGiSce.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1598&quot; height=&quot;915&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/t1G2je6q32XCmPWjVlGVou4ntF4YHCl LlLAGiSce. png &quot;data-key =&quot; 259255 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999; text-align: center; &quot;>; &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; (Lu Junjie/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Hukou&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2002, 258,315 fires occurred in China, causing 2,393 deaths. However, the fire at the Lan Jisu Internet Cafe on Xueyuan Road in Beijing on June 16, which killed 25 people, was undoubtedly the most discussed accident that year and had the greatest subsequent impact. All Internet cafes in Beijing were closed for rectification after the accident, and then Internet cafes across the country joined the ranks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Juveniles, arson, Internet cafes, video games... a series of keywords surrounding this case, which the media called &quot;the most serious juvenile crime since the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot;, turned mainstream public opinion on electronics almost overnight. The game&#39;s rage was heightened to its maximum. In the next two years, relevant departments issued a number of regulations to strengthen the standardized management of Internet cafes. This directly caused Li Xiaofeng, an avid &quot;StarCraft&quot; player in Ruzhou, Henan at that time, to be unable to find an Internet cafe where he could play the game. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;E-sports&quot; has become a proper noun at this point in time, and has become an emerging entertainment industry that cannot be ignored globally. It is even regarded as a &quot;cultural nation&quot; by South Korea next door. &quot;An important component of strategy. But for Chinese society, which has just joined the WTO and is unfamiliar with the Internet, e-sports is not only more unfamiliar, but also appears to be quite negative because of its association with games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, those in China who had a positive attitude towards e-sports included a group of elites with broad vision in the cultural and sports system, and more were a group of ignorant teenagers with pure love on the fringes of society. The former is a highbrow one, while the latter is not taken seriously. Based on common interests, the two groups formed a wonderful resonance in the same time and space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to prove themselves, the teenagers began to attack the championship. Ma Tianyuan and Wei Qidi won the first WCG &quot;StarCraft&quot; doubles championship in South Korea in 2001, and wore the five-star red flag to receive the award in Seoul. The deeds slightly shocked their hometown and those who saw the relevant news at the time - including the later WCG world champion Li Xiaofeng who was still in middle school in Ruzhou at the time. They learned that playing games actually There are also competitions, and you can also win glory for the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;TV stations began to have e-sports programs, which introduced game culture, e-sports events and players, and also broadcast some events from time to time. From 2002 to 2003, programs such as &quot;Games&quot; on Travel TV, &quot;Gamers&quot; on Shanghai TV, and &quot;E-Sports World&quot; on CCTV Sports Channel were launched one after another, and quickly became the top-rated products on their respective channels. It has refreshed many people&#39;s understanding of e-sports - it is a mental activity based on electronic games but completely different from electronic games that emphasizes competition, honor, professionalism and teamwork. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In such an unfriendly environment and with sparks everywhere, e-sports was listed as the 99th sports competition event by the State Sports General Administration on November 18, 2003. The issue of registering for residence has been resolved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mainstream games or their prototypes that built the later e-sports landscape had also appeared one after another before this point in time. &quot;StarCraft&quot; and &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; were already mainstream e-sports projects at that time; &quot;Warcraft 3&quot;, released in July 2002, would become the new mainstream in the near future; a player named Eul took advantage of &quot;Warcraft 3&quot; The included map editor created a battle map called Defense of the Antients&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(《卫士》)&lt;/span>;. Later, players directly Call it DOTA. This map, which seemed very rudimentary at the time, would soon incubate a new game type, as well as two games that hold up half of the global e-sports world, &quot;DOTA2&quot; and &quot;League of Legends&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The previous work &quot;Flash Dot Action&quot; of &quot;Armed Assault&quot; was released in 2001. This military simulation game developed by a Czech Studio and officially released in mainland China for a period of time is to pursue a high degree of truth. The operation was extremely complicated, resulting in a mediocre market response. However, it won a group of military enthusiasts, one of whom was Brandon Greene &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Brandon Greene)&lt;/span>;. This game created a &quot;battle royale&quot; battle map, in which dozens of people would parachute into a map and fight each other until the last person wins - he later put this gameplay into the game he participated in the development of &quot; PlayerUnknown&#39;s Battlegrounds&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This start doesn&#39;t look perfect, but it&#39;s not bad either - if nothing else goes wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Broadcast ban&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At 14:00 on September 25, 2023, CCTV Sports Channel broadcast the Hangzhou Asian Games e-sports project &quot;Glory of Kings&quot; Asian Games version of the Chinese team and the Thai team. In the final, the Chinese team defeated the Thai team 2-0 to advance to the final. It has been nearly 20 years since the last e-sports event appeared on a satellite TV channel in mainland China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Successful registration did not bring any visible policy support or funding to China’s e-sports. Compared with the official management of other sports, it can be said that no one cared about e-sports—until 2004 On April 12, 2018, less than half a year after e-sports officially became a sports competition, the management department issued the &quot;Notice on Prohibiting the Broadcast of Computer Online Game Programs&quot;, stipulating that after May 1 of that year, including &quot;E-Sports World&quot;, All video game-related programs on all Kailu TV channels across the country have been suspended. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of these programs set brilliant ratings records before they were suspended. Take &quot;Games and Things&quot; as an example. Since its launch on July 28, 2002, it has long occupied the top spot in the ratings of Travel TV. The number of users who regularly watch this program every day has reached about 4 million. The program team receives hundreds of enthusiastic letters from viewers across the country every week, and some people put five and ten yuan notes in envelopes to encourage the program team to continue the show. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Yang, a senior e-sports practitioner and the author of &quot;The Behind-the-Scenes History of Chinese E-sports&quot;, believes that e-sports already had a very good mass base in China at that time, and the impact of the ban on broadcasting was quite serious. &quot;The entire The most critical media link in the monetization process of e-sports has been directly blocked.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ban policy actually leaves a certain amount of room. For example, it does not prohibit paid encrypted channels from playing video game content, which also made it possible later Paid channels such as &quot;Game Fengyun&quot; emerged. However, it is obvious that with this cut, the audience market that e-sports can drive will be greatly limited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/acaHXCcFzTJRMvP58XdBUKHOaMww9OuBcMoMUXP7.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;626&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/acaHXCcFzTJRMvP58XdBUKHOaMww9OuBcMoMUXP7.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259240&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On December 21, 2003, Zhengzhou, Henan Communications’ first CS (&quot;Counter-Strike&quot;) competition, players compete&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;( Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;E-sports had almost only one commercial route that was proven to work at the time - just like traditional sports, relying on competitions to sell television broadcast rights, attract sponsorship, and Sponsorship and advertising, it is this classic model of traditional sports commercialization that has made Korean e-sports, which has been developed for less than 10 years, become a blockbuster. Of course, no one can guarantee that China’s e-sports will succeed in applying this model, but at that time no one knew how to take other paths. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Yang believes that in addition to the monetization needs related to survival, whether e-sports programs can be broadcast on Kailu TV channels, especially national channels like CCTV, will depend on its symbolic meaning and the market effect it can drive. Very different. Even today, even though there are dazzling live broadcasts, videos and other communication platforms everywhere, as long as CCTV starts broadcasting e-sports programs, it will still have a different impact. &quot;Advertisers will always calculate its actual monetization ability and influence. For example, why does Netflix adopt a subscription system? Why can&#39;t it just sell ads? Because the scale and influence of the Internet are not so big that it is enough to sell ads on it. To the point where it can support the entire system.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Realization&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Today, 20 years after successfully registering, Chinese e-sports has basically solved the problem of survival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, this road is not easy to walk. Chinese e-sports practitioners have been forced to explore the road that no one has traveled since the beginning. Maybe God will open a window when he closes a door. In 2004, when Kailu Channel banned the broadcast of e-sports programs, P2P live streaming technology also began to appear in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;P2P live broadcast technology, which uses limited bandwidth to ensure smooth video playback to the greatest extent, has almost become the core channel for e-sports communication. Of course, this channel is far less influential than television, but it is worse than nothing. It can be said that an entire generation of e-sports audiences have almost all watched various events through P2P live video platforms and witnessed Sky Li Xiaofeng and wNv team becoming world champions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although this group of viewers is also large, the traffic has not found an effective way to monetize during this period, and few people in the entire e-sports industry can see money. In 2005, Li Xiaofeng earned a salary of 1,800 yuan a month in the club. The bonus for becoming the world&#39;s top game champion was only 20,000 US dollars, and 30% of the tax was deducted - this was after eliminating thousands of masters. reward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then the 2008 financial crisis hit us again. Sponsors who had not taken their investment in the e-sports field seriously in the first place have withdrawn their investment. Events have been suspended, budgets have been reduced, and sponsorships have been withdrawn. Next, clubs have laid off employees and disbanded, and practitioners have begun to look for other options. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What finally extended the life of e-sports was a new way at the time - bringing goods. After 2010, the basic conditions for bringing goods were already in place: the first generation of e-sports viewers gradually entered the society and had salary income; the habit of online shopping became popular; video websites rose and live broadcast platforms emerged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Yang has been deeply involved in monetizing the attention of e-sports content. At first, they tried to sell gaming-related accessories such as keyboards, mice, and headphones, but these items were consumed very slowly, and the repurchase rate in the online store was not ideal—until they started selling a snack, meat floss. &quot;It&#39;s very cheap, costing less than a dime each, and the profit margin can reach 20%-30%.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to bringing physical goods, you can also bring virtual goods. Many web games are also eyeing the traffic in the e-sports circle, and they are quite generous. For example, the web game &quot;Shenxian Dao&quot; even announced that 70% of its revenue will be allocated to promotion channels. From players like Li Xiaofeng to anchors like &quot;Starboy&quot; Huang Xudong who explain their origins, they have all become beneficiaries of this model. But it was not easy to take this step back then. When Li Xiaofeng announced a joint venture with &quot;The Way of the Immortal&quot;, it once caused a lot of criticism in the industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Amidst the controversy, web game joint operation and meat waffles successfully saved the e-sports industry, which is difficult to monetize. After some video commentators tried their hand at connecting web games or selling snacks such as meat waffles, and became very successful, well-known current and retired players began to follow suit. In 2014, some enthusiastic netizens specially compiled the online store data of &quot;Ruofeng&quot;, the former captain of the League of Legends team WE, and believed that his monthly profit was conservatively estimated at around 800,000 yuan. The income from online stores directly marked the net worth of Internet celebrity players or commentators. Later, during the period when live broadcast platforms were burning the most money, news of various live broadcast platforms signing e-sports anchors for tens of millions of dollars began to spread. out. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Manufacturer Era&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is obvious that e-sports, which had just figured out its monetization path around 2012, could become a huge industry with revenue of over 100 billion yuan in 10 years. Meat floss and live broadcast rewards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On December 4, 2010, Tencent launched the &quot;Tencent Game Competition Platform&quot;, namely TGA. Many leagues that have been hatched by this platform are more famous than it, such as the &quot;Cross Fire&quot; event CFPL, the &quot;League of Legends&quot; event LPL, and the &quot;King of Honor&quot; event KPL. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tencent’s start in e-sports also means the emergence of a new model in which game manufacturers conduct events in person. This new model also caters to the marketing of a new generation of games. In the era when games such as &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; and &quot;Warcraft 3&quot; were popular, game manufacturers could basically leave the game behind after selling copies of the games. It was difficult for e-sports events to bring any follow-up benefits worth mentioning to the manufacturers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But it is different for online games such as &quot;League of Legends&quot; and &quot;Honor of Kings&quot;. They are originally free to download and play, and they make money by in-game purchases of additional products, such as character skins. . As a result, game sales have become an infinitely stretched process in which demand is constantly being created. Since then, e-sports has had the function of bringing goods to game manufacturers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Zhuang Minghao, a senior e-sports practitioner, believes that it is almost inevitable for a game manufacturer to personally dominate its own game e-sports competition. “Even if a strong enough third party appears, it will slowly change. We have talked with the first party.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, the focus of manufacturers’ own events is inevitably ambiguous. Do you want to do event business or game marketing? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But this issue was not important 10 years ago. No matter what the purpose of the manufacturers, they may still be the most motivated to make the event well-esports has begun to usher in an era of manufacturer dominance. In the early days, Third parties emerged one after another, and scuffles continued. The era of a grassroots team in which any manufacturer spent some money to organize a tournament and then invited several clubs to compete was over. It was also during this period that leagues such as the LPL began to organize club alliances, cancel promotion and relegation and establish a seat bidding system, bring offline games to the Bird&#39;s Nest Stadium, and implement a regional home and away system... A decent e-sports league is What does it look like? There is a template for this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;LPL has become the largest e-sports league in the world in terms of scale and influence. The industrial scale and social influence of Chinese e-sports have also achieved the greatest growth during this period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of Pan Jie, CEO of LGD Club, the quality of e-sports content is one of the core values ​​​​of whether the vitality of the game can be sustained. Under such underlying logic, manufacturers will do their best to ensure the fairness of events, play a good role as managers of large-scale e-sports leagues, and attract more sponsors and fans for this e-sports league to ensure the integrity of the entire e-sports content. healthy growth. &quot;Manufacturer-led events are more durable, more standardized, and more professional than previous third parties, and can better guarantee the rights and interests of all participating parties. Players, clubs, fans, media, sponsors, and game brands can all get what they want. , this is a very good thing for the e-sports industry ecology itself.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Cake&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is indeed easy to enjoy the shade under the big tree, but if there are too many people enjoying the shade, there will always be people who are Sunburned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;2022 China E-Sports Industry Report&quot; released by the E-Sports Working Committee of the China Music and Digital Association shows that the revenue of China&#39;s e-Sports industry in 2022 will be 144.503 billion yuan. But of the 144.503 billion yuan in revenue, 81.52% was from the game itself. Among the remaining 18%, 15.28%are live revenue of e -sports content; the remaining points are basically divided by clubs and events. Excluding game revenue, the actual revenue of the e-sports industry is approximately 25.8 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It seems that game manufacturers have made most of the money, and the manufacturers may not be willing to divide it up. Then the problem began to become acute. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Pan Jie’s view, the income structure in which manufacturers earn the lion’s share is very reasonable. As for whether manufacturers are sincerely engaged in events or just want to rely on events for marketing, the two are not necessarily contradictory. &quot;Only a more standardized, healthier and more benign e-sports ecology can help game manufacturers and the upstream and downstream e-sports industries jointly make the pie bigger, thereby continuously producing higher-quality content and hot topics.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;The club’s earning power has indeed increased with the influence of e-sports events. Zhuang Minghao remembers that from 2013 to 2014, an Internet company wanted to buy a chest title for an LPL club uniform for only 200,000 yuan a year. &quot;Today, if there is no 20 million yuan, no one will talk to you.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, There are still not many clubs that really make money from e-sports, and the traditional sports business that revolves around events and club operations has obviously not really taken off yet. In 2021, Pan Yibin, general manager of EDG E-sports Club, revealed in an interview that there are currently no more than 5 domestic e-sports clubs that are self-financing. According to the &quot;China E-Sports Industry Report from January to June 2023&quot; released by the E-Sports Working Committee of the China Music and Digital Association, as of June 2023, there are 191 e-Sports clubs in China that can be queried. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huang Xudong believes that the commercial potential of domestic e-sports has not been fully tapped. &quot;I have always wanted to ask, can basketball, football or traditional sports such as table tennis have as much influence in the country as e-sports today?&quot; Can we compete? I think basketball and football can compete. Which of the remaining projects can compete with e-sports? But it is strange. Although some traditional sports projects cannot compete in terms of traffic, their income is much higher than that of e-sports. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the environment has improved significantly compared to 20 years ago, social recognition is still an issue. &quot;I still feel that you are not doing your job properly. Young people may recognize it, but for people who have some social resources, &quot;In fact, his recognition of this thing is still not as high as traditional sports.&quot; Huang Xudong said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/vbHCEfsdmr4LfNjeBubF97TZpEODJIiJlDSxMbI3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;497&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/vbHCEfsdmr4LfNjeBubF97TZpEODJIiJlDSxMbI3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259242&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Interstellar Old Boys&quot; Sun Yifeng and Huang Xudong&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt; h4>;Lifespan&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Even if all aspects of the manufacturer-led competition system make money and everyone is happy, there is still another problem: there is more than one game manufacturer, and the game life is bound to be limited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Which game will be popular and will become the next dominant e-sports project? Which game should each link in the industry - manufacturers, event operators, clubs, players, anchors or commentators - choose? There may be many ways to talk about betting, but in the final analysis, &quot;Looking at fate is really just looking at fate.&quot; Huang Xudong said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, Blizzard, which was so popular with &quot;StarCraft&quot; and &quot;Warcraft 3&quot;, would never have thought that a map editor included with &quot;Warcraft 3&quot; would actually hatch DOTA, which is far more popular than the original game. . And Guinsoo&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（Guinsoo）&lt;/span>; and Ice Frog&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot; >;(Icefrog)&lt;/span>;When I was still generating electricity for love for free and constantly updating the DOTA map in &quot;Warcraft 3&quot;, I would not have thought that one of them would later go to Riot Games to work on &quot;League of Legends&quot;, and the other would go to Vale Fu makes &quot;DOTA2&quot;. Blizzard would never have imagined that a great idea hatched by its own game would give birth to two great games, but in the end it had nothing to do with itself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next dominant e-sports game project is something that most current e-sports practitioners dare not relax for a moment, even if it has not yet appeared. The two most popular e-sports games in China today, &quot;League of Legends&quot; was released in 2009 and &quot;Honor of Kings&quot; was released in 2015. They have been on the center stage longer than almost all previous popular e-sports games. , &quot;DOTA2&quot; and &quot;CSGO&quot;, which are in the second echelon, are bundled together, and their income cannot keep up with either of the first two. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is of course inseparable from the careful layout of game manufacturers in event operations, the manufacturer-led event model, and the improvement of event operation levels, which has effectively extended the lifespan of many popular e-sports projects in this era, and may It also raises the threshold for new game projects to change dynasties. Pan Jie commented on this, “In fact, it is because the recent e-sports game projects are not that good and are not enough to have an impact on the current popular projects. This forces new e-sports projects to come up with new ideas. Come.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/O7IperkYCoU0x1xf9UxIr9uEz8XHtcnqtQYWqek3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1795 &quot; height=&quot;1198&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/O7IperkYCoU0x1xf9UxIr9uEz8XHtcnqtQYWqek3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259254&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 26, 2023, in the final of the Asian Games version of the e-sports &quot;Honor of Kings&quot; at the Hangzhou Asian Games, the Chinese team defeated the Malaysian team 2-0 and won the championship&lt; span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The revenue of these games that are the mainstay of China&#39;s e-sports today is almost all declining. Ordinary players feel that the qualifying time of &quot;League of Legends&quot; has become longer, and the number of robots in the &quot;Honor of Kings&quot; rankings has obviously increased, which is a sign that is not very optimistic. In terms of macro data, e-sports game revenue in 2022 will be 117.802 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 15.96%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;PlayerUnknown&#39;s Battlegrounds&quot;, which was born in 2017 and had high hopes in the e-sports circle, has been entangled with the domestic version number issue. The mobile version of &quot;Peace Elite&quot; was not released until 2019, and it was not released. It did not open up a new situation as expected, and the revenue of &quot;Peace Elite&quot; will show a downward trend starting from 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The decline of the old king is only a matter of time. Before the new succession game comes, &quot;I can only hope that the decline will be extended.&quot; Zhuang Minghao lamented. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Saudi Arabia&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Sometimes the decline is gentle and silent, and sometimes the decline is like lightning and thunder. For example, in &quot;StarCraft 2&quot;, with the closure of Chinese servers on January 24, 2023, the manufacturer terminated all operations in the mainland Chinese market, and all Chinese players who logged in through normal channels disappeared. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The irony is that almost half a month later, on February 13, 2023, Chinese player Li Peinan, who was not optimistic at all before the game ;&quot;>;(Time)&lt;/span>;In the &quot;StarCraft 2&quot; IEM Katowice finals, he defeated South Korean player Maru with a score of 4-1 and won the world championship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is uncertainty in expecting the manufacturer to do well in the event. As long as the manufacturer is reliable, what if the manufacturer goes crazy? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So Pan Jie hopes that professional manufacturer events and high-standard third-party events can be effectively combined in the future. “Next year’s Kazan Future Games in Russia and the E-sports World Cup in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia will also mark the launch of high-standard third-party events. Third-party events will return to center stage.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the largest third-party events ever has emerged. On October 23, 2023, surrounded by FIFA President Infantino and star Cristiano Ronaldo, who is playing in the Saudi league, Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman announced that Saudi Arabia will launch the annual Esports World Cup &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（Esports World Cup）&lt;/span>;, the first event will be held in Riyadh in the summer of 2024. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The young prime minister, who is said to be a veteran player of the FPS game &quot;Call of Duty&quot;, made a clear goal: &quot;The E-Sports World Cup is a natural next step in Saudi Arabia&#39;s journey to become the world&#39;s premier gaming and e-Sports center. One step.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, the annual e-sports event Gamers8 hosted by Saudi Arabia will kick off. By 2023, it has become the e-sports event with the largest prize pool in the world, and is nicknamed the &quot;Oil Cup&quot; by Chinese netizens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although this third party is unprecedentedly powerful, the pattern of game manufacturers dominating the competition may not change overnight, and a new round of gaming is bound to happen. Huang Xudong discovered that &quot;League of Legends&quot; has never appeared in the two Gamers8 sessions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although game manufacturers&#39; competitions have proven to be a relatively successful path, Huang Xudong believes that not every manufacturer has the effort. When faced with the choice of whether to conduct competitions, manufacturers&#39; mentality is also very complicated. . &quot;Some manufacturers want to do it themselves, and some manufacturers just want to make good games. As for e-sports events, they can cooperate. If there is a third party like Saudi Arabia, it does a good job and invests a lot, and the manufacturers don&#39;t have to spend any money. Money, you can even make money in it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huang Xudong thinks that perhaps the biggest advantage of the Saudis is that e-sports is part of the national influence strategy. They do not expect to make money from the event itself, but want to He wants the hundreds of thousands of tourists who flock to the Saudi E-sports World Cup every year, as well as the establishment of game companies in the country, and other bigger gears. &quot;They have money, they can afford it, and they don&#39;t want short-term gains. They want the long term, and they want 2030.&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(referring to Saudi Vision 2030)&lt;/span>;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Given time, no one is sure whether Saudi Arabia will always be just a third party. In 2022, the Saudi Mohammed bin Salman Foundation MiSK also acquired 96.18% of the shares of the Japanese game company SNK through its game development company EGDC, thereby mastering the copyright of the well-known fighting game &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;. In the past two years, capital from Saudi Arabia has continued to invest in game manufacturers and e-sports event operating companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Eggs&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, at least Chinese e-sports players no longer need to eat fried buns or eggs in order to save money to practice like the players of Li Xiaofeng and Su Hao. The bread is getting better. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the 29-year-old retired &quot;League of Legends&quot; player Alan, when he debuted, he did not need to go back and forth like in the past to find a club that opened in an Internet cafe and could collapse at any time. . Talented players like him will naturally be contacted by the club after gaining game points or ranking in the rankings. When joining the team, they will receive a basic salary of 4,000 yuan plus room and board, and they can basically start the life of a professional player without any distractions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Alan found that his age was not an advantage, and his talent and strength were not high enough for him to move to a higher level, he started as an analyst and assistant coach at the club&#39;s suggestion and began to move from player to coach. Transformation. Now he works as a coach at a youth academy, cultivating fresh blood for higher-level competitions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The youth training camp has also unintentionally produced another function: many children who think they have e-sports talents or who simply cannot distinguish between the concepts of gaming and e-sports enter the youth training camp and train like professional players. After training, living, and seeing the real world, I realized that I was not the material, so I honestly went home and went to school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Today at least there are many practitioners in the (e-sports) industry. You don&#39;t have to worry about not having food tomorrow, right?
