He revealed in his social updates that he could not breathe in while sleeping. This situation once lasted for 6 minutes. According to the advice given by the doctor, &quot;The once strong athlete now wears &lt; /span>;&lt;span>;On the ventilator&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;In fact, Yang Wei’s symptoms are not an isolated case. Celebrities from different industries and ages have also appeared on the hot topic due to the same situation. Search. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;When US President Biden gave a speech in June this year, the media discovered that there were traces of ventilator straps on his face; In a program, Fok Qigang disclosed the fact that he suffers from insomnia disorder and moderate sleep apnea; Chen Qiaoen once underwent surgery because his throat collapsed during sleep and he could not breathe air; artist Hu Haiquan took the initiative to wear a respirator because of snoring during the program machine to sleep. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;We all know that snoring after falling asleep generally only affects the sleep of the person next to you, but unexpectedly, in some cases, Snoring may be accompanied by apnea, causing people to &quot;repeatedly suffocate&quot; in their dreams, which may even endanger their lives. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/17/Mrxb5DiqLERFb732b6q8D5iS8yyU84GFLNAOqBZV.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/17/Mrxb5DiqLERFb732b6q8D5iS8yyU84GFLNAOqBZV.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258641&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align : left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Can snoring cause apnea? &lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Yang Wei’s condition is medically called “apnea syndrome&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Syndrome&lt; /span>;&lt;span>;&quot;, including three types: obstructive, central, and mixed. Among them, &quot;obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS)&quot; is the most common, commonly known as &quot;snoring&quot;, and is mainly characterized by sleep Snoring, accompanied by breathlessness and hypoxia, may lead to sudden death in severe cases. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Of course, not all snoring will be diagnosed as apnea syndrome&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Symptom&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;, there is currently no confirmed necessary relationship between the two. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;According to the &quot;Multiple Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Adults&quot; released by the Sleep Respiratory Disorders Group of the Respiratory Disease Branch of the Chinese Medical Association in 2018 &quot;Discipline Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines&quot; (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Guidelines&quot;), the diagnostic criteria for apnea syndrome&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; mainly include two: the number of apnea and hypopnea events, and How often both occur. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;The apnea mentioned here is almost literal. It means that the airflow disappears or is significantly weakened during breathing, while hypopnea means , refers to the reduction of respiratory volume and blood oxygen saturation below the basic level. During a 7-hour sleep period, if apnea and hypopnea recur more than 30 times, or the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is greater than 5 times per hour, you can be diagnosed with apnea syndrome&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; Sign&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Obstructive apnea syndrome&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Symptom&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; (OSA) and central The difference between apnea syndrome (CSA) and apnea syndrome (CSA) is that the former is apnea caused by upper airway obstruction, and the respiratory drive function of the central nervous system is normal, which can be simply understood as oral The nose stops but the brain is fine. The latter is caused by an abnormality of the central nervous system. When the brain stops, the mouth and nose also stop. Mixed apnea syndrome (MSA) is a combination of both. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Surprisingly, apnea syndrome&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;symptoms&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;surface It only interferes with sleep at night. In fact, this kind of sleep rhythm disorder caused by irregular breathing will cause more lasting adverse effects on daily life, such as daytime sleepiness, memory loss, and even possible psychological, Intellectual and behavioral abnormalities. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Medical experts who released the &quot;Guidelines&quot; believe that the rapid increase in weight of OSAHS patients in a short period of time may be related to hypertension, Coronary heart disease, arrhythmia, stroke, type 2 diabetes and other complications may occur. Family members of patients with the above symptoms can pay more attention. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/17/ilQWhKpfm6lliE77D97DPZ0enP7fLxHRjSSusvvU.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/17/ilQWhKpfm6lliE77D97DPZ0enP7fLxHRjSSusvvU.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258642&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align : left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Why is this disease easily missed&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;In 2019, the academic journal &quot;Lancet-Respiratory Medicine&quot; published a paper titled &quot;Obstructive The survey report &quot;Sleep Apnea and the Global Economic Burden&quot;, based on the diagnostic criteria published by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), compiled the prevalence data of obstructive sleep apnea from 16 countries and 17 studies. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;This report believes that the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea has increased from 2%-4% 10 years ago to 24% Above, more than 85% of sleep apnea patients are missed. Researchers further speculated based on data that approximately 936 million adults aged 30 to 69 worldwide suffer from varying degrees of obstructive sleep apnea, with China having the largest number of affected people, followed by the United States, Brazil and India. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;When it comes to why sleep apnea is particularly easy to miss diagnosis, the author of the report believes that this may stem from everyone&#39;s concern about sleep health. Two prejudices. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;First of all, everyone is more accustomed to blaming age and stress for fatigue in daily life. &quot;As people get older, they cannot sleep well.&quot; &quot;It&#39;s normal.&quot; &quot;The KPIs at work are too heavy and I can&#39;t sleep just thinking about them.&quot; They rarely think about sleep diseases. In fact, repeated apnea during sleep can also lead to a decline in body function, leading to migraines, chronic fatigue and other diseases. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Secondly, in some traditional concepts, snoring often becomes a sign of &quot;sleeping soundly&quot;. Even if the family members notice the abnormality, They rarely interrupt and pay attention to them. To take a step back, some people&#39;s snoring is inherently irregular, and the occurrence of apnea is somewhat random, making it difficult for relatives and family members to effectively identify it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;The &quot;Guidelines&quot; specifically mention that body obesity (referring to body weight exceeding 20% ​​or more of the standard body weight) may increase the risk of developing diseases. The risk of sleep apnea; the prevalence increases positively with age, more women suffer from the disease after menopause, and men have a higher prevalence than women during their reproductive years. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;In addition, sedentary people, long-term drinkers and smokers, and people with a family history of OSAHS are also at higher risk. disease risk. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;In the final analysis, this disease is common, but it is not easy to find. Fortunately, we can now use the power of some technology . Many domestic medical studies have confirmed that portable oximeters and mobile phone snoring analysis apps are helpful in early diagnosis and screening of OSAHS patients. Perhaps in the near future, monitoring of apnea syndrome&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; Signs&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;can be as convenient and fast as monitoring body temperature. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;More importantly, if you suspect that you or your family members have similar symptoms, you should go to the hospital as soon as possible and use professional equipment for diagnosis. Treatment is provided by surgery, braces, ventilators, etc. One-third of a person&#39;s life is spent in sleep. Healthy sleep is true health. I wish you all a good sleep and good health every day. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 18 Nov 2023 16:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[离经叛道的“禁片之王”，终于迎来大结局]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260850]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-18 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;This month, the biggest event in the animation industry&lt;/span>;, the non-animated version of &quot;Attack on The ending of &quot;Giant&quot; is none other than this. The long-awaited final work finally brings an end to this epic series. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/ea5a811e3e55d28ca36b543387fd4f66.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;537&quot; height=&quot;416&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/ea5a811e3e55d28ca36b543387fd4f66.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258721&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;Attack on Titan&quot; is the representative work of Japanese comic artist Isayama Hajime. It has a total of 139 chapters and was serialized in comic magazines for twelve years from 2009 to 2021. In 2013, the TV animation version of &quot;Attack on Titan&quot; came out. After ten years of production, a total of four seasons were released (except for the theatrical version and special episodes). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Douban entry, the complete viewing order of the entire drama is: &quot;Attack on Titan&quot; (2013) → &quot;Attack on Titan&quot; Season 2 (2017) → &quot;Attack on Titan&quot; &quot;Attack on Titan&quot; Season 3 (2018) → &quot;Attack on Titan&quot; Season 3 Part.2 (2019) → &quot;Attack on Titan&quot; Final Season Part.1 (2020) Part.2 (2022) → &quot;Attack on Titan&quot; The final season&amp;nbsp;the final part&amp;nbsp;the first part&amp;nbsp;the second part (2023). &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/260482835e33291d29483186b6089ea3.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;337&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/260482835e33291d29483186b6089ea3.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258720 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The unique world view structure, bizarre background setting, incredible imagination, bloody battle scenes, and sensitive issues made this work popular as soon as it came out. attracted the attention of all walks of life. But while attracting countless viewers, it was also banned by many countries in the world due to its large scale. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despite this, it still achieved a good rating on Douban, with Jiji scoring 9 points+, and even the least optimistic final chapter has a rating of 9.3. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/4c766315fbedf871e47850543e220dc2.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;483&quot; height=&quot;439&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/4c766315fbedf871e47850543e220dc2.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258723&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Since the comic version has been completed in 2021, the audience already knows the ending of this work. It is worth noting that when the comic was completed, it caused huge controversy due to the plot that violated human ethics and was criticized by fans as a &quot;bad ending&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fundamental reason is that Allen, the protagonist of &quot;Attack on Titan&quot;, is suspected of &quot;matricide&quot;. With his precognitive ability, he most likely manipulated the Immaculate Titan to eat his mother, leaving a huge psychological trauma on his young self. He then joined the Survey Corps, determined to get rid of the Titan. This setting is mainly to make the whole story logical and &lt;span>; form a closed loop of cause and effect. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;But whether it is based on the emotions of the characters or the emotions of the audience, this setting is difficult to accept, and there is a sense of powerlessness in trying to justify it. To paraphrase netizens, this move is tantamount to “Harry Potter manipulating Voldemort to go back in time and kill his parents”, “Batman buying a thief to go back in time and kill his parents”, “Iron Man instructing the Winter Soldier to go back and kill him” One’s own parents”. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the animated version, this &quot;matricide&quot; plot was brushed aside and explained in an extremely vague manner. Because of this, it wasn&#39;t as controversial as the comic version, but it just added a bit of tragedy to Allen. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/fb44a83ea8c8765afcbe894da7e5f7fa.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;692&quot; height=&quot;389&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/fb44a83ea8c8765afcbe894da7e5f7fa.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258722 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The reason why &quot;Attack on Titan&quot; is hailed as&lt;/span>; a masterpiece is that it reflects reality and depicts an imaginary world with great conflict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The story begins with an invasion of giants on Parady Island. Human beings were unable to resist the giants, so they built three high walls (Xina, Rose, and Maria) to resist the giants, in exchange for a hundred years of peace. But the terrifying giant still came. &quot;On that day, mankind finally recalled the fear of being dominated by giants, and the humiliation of being trapped in a birdcage&lt;span>;.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Eren and his friends Mikasa and Armin suffered heavy blows during the Titan invasion, and were eventually admitted to the Survey Corps to fight against the Titans together. At first, the growth path of Allen and others followed the routine of traditional hot-blooded comics. But as the plot continues to advance, the audience soon discovers its anomaly - it does not stick to the binary opposition of good and evil, but digs deeper into the complexity of human nature. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The reversal in the plot drives the audience and the protagonist to constantly think together and break, rebuild, and break their own thinking. Allen&#39;s life was hanging by a thread during the battle, but he unexpectedly forced out his giant power. There are also many giants hidden in the Survey Corps. The three comrades who have been with Allen through life and death not only have the power of giants, but they are also &quot;spies.&quot; I originally thought that giants were inhuman monsters, but I didn&#39;t expect that giants are also human beings. Giants have also suffered from wars and are victims of racial antagonism. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/f9462227c0cb4cb5237e2357034e66a9.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;693&quot; height=&quot;383&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/f9462227c0cb4cb5237e2357034e66a9.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258724 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;All humans who can become giants&lt;/span>; are Eldians. They are regarded by ordinary people as &quot;descendants of demons.&quot; Two thousand years ago, the Eldians, who received the power of giants from their ancestor Ymir, became kings of the world. A hundred years ago, the Eldians were defeated by the Marais. The royal family led some people across the ocean to Parady Island and lived an isolated life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And those Eldians who stayed in other countries were reduced to slaves and lived like a concentration camp. For thousands of years, ordinary people have been deeply hostile to the Eldians and have always wanted to get rid of them. This kind of hostility led Allen to &quot;blackening&quot;, and he decided to use the sound of the earth to launch the &quot;Destruction Plan&quot; - hundreds of thousands of 60-meter-tall super-large &lt;span>; Innocent Titans ran rampant on the earth, indiscriminately Trampling all life, massacred 80% of the human population outside Parady Island. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The final chapter tells about the &quot;final battle&quot; after the earthquake started. At the end, Mikasa found Eren&#39;s true body under the cover of other members, then cut off Eren&#39;s head and gave him a passionate kiss. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/d6f86c8569a729a1ad946452176faf14.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;607&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/d6f86c8569a729a1ad946452176faf14.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258719 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On the surface, &quot;Attack on Titan&quot;&lt;/span>; tells the story of &quot;a boy who slays dragons and eventually turns into a dragon.&quot; However, upon closer inspection, it is not that Simplicity is about sacrifice, but also about salvation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ellen&#39;s death has long been doomed. As early as the investiture ceremony, he had already predicted the future. He repeatedly tried to change his destiny, but all ended in failure. In order to break the reincarnation, let the giant&#39;s power disappear completely, and let the Eldians be treated as equals and even respected, he can only embark on an extremely lonely road. He started the roar of the earth, started the massacre, and then made his companions heroes, intending to use his own sacrifice to exchange for the peace of the Eldians. &lt;span>; As he himself said, &quot;This is to save Parady Island.&quot; The only way to win over everyone”. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;What Allen did was another way of ending sorrow with war. He weighed the difference between salvation and sacrifice, and finally chose to sacrifice the whole world to save those around him. This decision transformed him from a hero into a demon. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/adcd3b5f37cd9df03705d86e6529a58d.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;692&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/adcd3b5f37cd9df03705d86e6529a58d.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258725 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In addition to exploring the complexity of human nature, &lt;/span>; &quot;Attack on Titan&quot; also involves many profound propositions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, freedom. Allen has always pursued freedom. Since he was a child, he has been curious about the sea outside the wall and the other side of the sea, thinking that it is an ideal world of freedom. But in the end, he discovered that &quot;there are enemies on the other side of the sea.&quot; So-called freedom, especially absolute freedom, does not exist at all. As a result, Allen finally became a free slave until death freed him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another example is the discussion on the meaning of survival. In the final chapter, Armin and Zeke have a philosophical conversation. Jike is a typical pessimist. He believes that the fate of human beings is to undergo an endless and painful reincarnation. The purpose of life is to reproduce, which is meaningless. Armin believes that the meaning of life lies in the moment and the feeling of living in the present: picking up shells at the beach, running with friends, reading at home on a rainy day, watching squirrels eating tree fruits... these may seem random. The sporadic fragments constitute a colorful chapter in human life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;These propositions give &quot;Attack on Titan&quot; a depth that ordinary hot-blooded comics do not have. Therefore, in a sense, in the past ten years, the audience has watched Allen and others grow and part ways, and at the same time, as their personal minds have matured, they have gained more perception and understanding of this work. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The divisions and wars in the human world caused by issues such as wealth and poverty, race, ideology, etc., are always recurring and endless. Just like the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict, they always seem to verify the metaphors contained in Isayama Hajime&#39;s &quot;Attack on Titan&quot; again and again. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At the end of the story, Mikasa buried Eren under the tree where he liked to take a nap. In the future, even if the power of giants is lost, human wars will never stop. At this time, a man discovered the tree where Allen was buried. He walked in, and just like the ancestor Ymir thousands of years ago, he was about to gain the power of a giant...&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This seems to tell us that as long as the fate of mankind changes over and over again, , then the tragedy will not be completely ended. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/daf3712a921d7eb60a4ae64d6f372410.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;692&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/daf3712a921d7eb60a4ae64d6f372410.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258726 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In this case, is this world of constant conflicts still worth our efforts, struggle and life? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This goes back to the conversation between Zeke and Armin. They are like the two sides of Sou Isayama. On the one hand, they reveal the nature of the world and point out its cruelty to us; on the other hand, they give us warmth, hope and strength, allowing us to base ourselves on the present, cherish precious moments, and live our lives well. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Perhaps, in the final analysis, everything is just a matter of choice. Will you choose to be Zeke or Armin? Or do you have other options? No matter how you want to survive in the world, it all depends on you. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 18 Nov 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[当WeWork不再work]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260848]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-18 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/18/JGRhwuRuCpQduncfyATYDZirEwUctBOQITGqN4gD.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/JGRhwuRuCpQduncfyATYDZirEwUctBOQITGqN4gD . jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258717&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;August 19, 2023, Beijing, WeWork joint shared office space&lt;span style= &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of October 12th, Huang Wei, who was on his way to work, suddenly received a mass notice from the front desk - the office area will be closed from now on.

The price of a WeWork near the Suzhou River for the same configuration of workstations was around 2,000 yuan. The salesman told him that if the high vacancy rate hadn&#39;t affected his business, he wouldn&#39;t have been able to sign for this location at this price. At that time, in this WeWork, the office areas with less than 5 people were quite saturated, while the offices with more than 10 people were completely vacant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;first come, first served&quot; reminder at the front desk did not allow him to hesitate. Huang Wei quickly selected an office space located one kilometer away by WeWork. When he saw the news that &quot;WeWork filed for bankruptcy protection&quot;, he had already moved into the WeWork office area in Shanghai Plaza for half a month. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 6, local time, in order to get rid of huge debts, WeWork filed for bankruptcy protection in New Jersey, USA. However, the bankruptcy filing is limited to WeWork&#39;s offices in the United States and Canada. The next day, WeWork China issued a statement stating that WeWork China had separated from WeWork at the end of 2020 and had independent operating and management capabilities as an independent brand. &quot;The major strategic restructuring decisions made by WeWork in the United States and Canada have no connection with WeWork China.&quot; .&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;WeWork, founded in New York, USA, is known as the &quot;originator of shared office.&quot; WeWork will lease commercial buildings for a long time at preferential prices, then divide them into shared office spaces after redesigning and renovating them. WeWork will provide flexible leasing contracts for freelancers, start-ups and large enterprises, etc., and earn rent differences and additional service fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2010, when it was first founded, the negative impact of the U.S. financial crisis was still continuing. Commercial buildings were widely idle due to the wave of business closures, a large number of companies laid off employees, and the unemployed became freelancers. WeWork, which emerged at that time, not only provided stylish decoration and flexible leasing options, but also provided free coffee drinks and organized a variety of community activities... WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann advocated &quot;space as a service&quot; and declared To create a &quot;physical social network&quot;, a &quot;world that allows people to live rather than just make a living.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/uDRbK6SD0u9ElpCRqVlC0VN5YV3jgatYqoXhjH1r.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;633&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/uDRbK6SD0u9ElpCRqVlC0VN5YV3jgatYqoXhjH1r.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258715&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On November 6, 2019, in Tokyo, Japan, SoftBank Group Chairman and President Masayoshi Son attended a press conference. SoftBank said the value of its investment in WeWork fell by nearly $4.6 billion &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;U.S. benchmark after financial crisis Interest rates have been at a low level for a long time, and capital is eager to enter the private equity market to seek higher returns. In an era when the concept of the sharing economy was highly popular, WeWork became the darling of capital and became a unicorn only four years after its establishment. In 2019, with the support of major shareholder SoftBank, WeWork&#39;s valuation soared to an astonishing US$47 billion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son called WeWork &quot;the next Alibaba.&quot; Alibaba is the most successful investment case of this &quot;unicorn hunter&quot;. In 2000, SoftBank invested US$20 million in Alibaba, which was only one year old. 14 years later, Alibaba went public, and the value of SoftBank’s shares increased approximately 2,900 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;SoftBank was once the investment benchmark in the sharing economy track. Masayoshi Son advocates injecting massive amounts of capital into start-up companies to help them quickly crush competitors in scale and become a dominant brand in the market, hoping to achieve long-term profitability after gaining absolute advantages in users and the market. Uber and Didi are SoftBank’s investment cases in the sharing economy track during the same period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, half a year after WeWork reached the peak of its valuation, it fell into a long and steep decline stage. In August 2019, as the initial public offering (IPO) application was exposed, WeWork&#39;s consecutive losses triggered market concerns about the company&#39;s profitability. Neumann&#39;s financial and leadership issues have also been exposed one after another. In the same month, Uber, which had just been listed for half a year, suffered its largest loss since announcing its financial report after falling below the issue price. For a time, there was a lot of discussion about the bursting of the unicorn bubble. WeWork&#39;s plans to go public are on hold indefinitely. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, Neumann resigned as CEO and new management was brought in to help restructure the company&#39;s leasing business. It wasn&#39;t until October 2021 that WeWork finally went public with a valuation of US$9 billion. However, going public is not a panacea. Instead, it has become a magnifying glass that continues to expose problems. Although WeWork has always regarded itself as a technology company, it has never been able to achieve non-linear growth relying on its own profits, and its business model has not departed from the category of asset-heavy commercial real estate leasing. WeWork&#39;s customers are mainly small and entrepreneurial institutions with weak risk resistance and high liquidity. As competition in the industry becomes increasingly fierce, WeWork has to face the problem of price reductions and rising costs in order to retain these customers who are extremely cost-sensitive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The COVID-19 epidemic broke out around the world in 2020, and working from home became a common trend. The economic recession caused a large number of customers to close their businesses, and the office vacancy rate increased sharply. As a &quot;second landlord&quot;, WeWork still needs to pay rent to the landlord. WeWork, which emerged from the previous crisis, became a victim of the new crisis. Maturity mismatch may bring huge profits during economic booms, but it is a heavy burden during economic downturns, and the Federal Reserve&#39;s several rounds of interest rate hikes since the epidemic have exacerbated WeWork&#39;s debt burden. The long-standing systemic risks have ushered in a concentrated outbreak. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/gjloiN0n5FG6LPE2jsj5YWdTUDrfDfeu0wMnJf7h.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/gjloiN0n5FG6LPE2jsj5YWdTUDrfDfeu0wMnJf7h.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258716&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On April 12, 2018, WeWork co-founder Neumann visited Shanghai&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2023, WeWork pointed out in its second-quarter financial report that taking into account losses and expected cash needs, coupled with increased membership losses and current liquidity levels, the company&#39;s continued operations depend on management. Whether the company can improve its liquidity and profitability over the next 12 months. As of June 30, the company still had $2.9 billion in long-term debt and $13.3 billion in long-term lease debt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;WeWork CEO David Tolley believes that &quot;unsustainable leases must be repriced&quot; due to a lack of &quot;the necessary financial flexibility to adapt to the rapidly changing commercial real estate market.&quot; Filing for bankruptcy protection is WeWork&#39;s attempt to survive in adversity. WeWork is seeking court approval to terminate 69 leases that are &quot;substantially unable to operate&quot; and negotiate with more than 400 landlords to modify existing leases. Analysts generally believe that WeWork’s exit will lead to a further increase in the already high office vacancy rate, which will have a negative impact on the cash flow and value of office buildings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like a cycle. While the market is enthusiastically discussing the butterfly effect caused by the WeWork crisis, competitors are more willing to regard WeWork&#39;s &quot;big defeat&quot; as an &quot;episode&quot; in industry changes, or even as an opportunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The great irony of WeWork’s bankruptcy is that it happened at a time of record performance for the industry.” Jamie Hodari, CEO of Industrious, a New York-based shared office operator, told the Financial Times &quot;I made a metaphor during the interview, &quot;When a Marriott hotel is not doing well, it will become a Hyatt hotel.&quot; Mark Dixon, CEO of IWG Group, who is also a shared office operator, said in an interview with the BBC, IWG has now acquired and relaunched 40 office spaces that were once part of WeWork. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the lessons learned from WeWork, the shift from the asset-heavy model of &quot;direct leasing&quot; to the light-asset model of &quot;profit sharing&quot; has been a common effort in the industry in recent years, and now it is even more urgent. However, whether owners are willing to accept this adjustment still depends on their comprehensive assessment of the economic environment and operational value. A recent report released by IWG shows that 200 of the 204 new office spaces it signed in the third quarter of 2023 are asset-light operations, but overall, 60% are still operated by traditional leasing methods. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Chinese market, WeWork China also hopes to become the traffic entrance in the stock era. &quot;The business model that only relies on rent difference is very difficult, but this is also our core competitiveness and advantage,&quot; Quan Bin, vice president of WeWork Greater China, said in a recent interview with &quot;Guandian New Media&quot; that companies must survive To achieve better and longer results, we must work faster and more resolutely in reducing costs and increasing efficiency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/aXaJ158QLVgKsFL7LpYGSCNn5DIyBk8rsjRTmAeT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/aXaJ158QLVgKsFL7LpYGSCNn5DIyBk8rsjRTmAeT.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258718&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Shanghai, WeWork joint shared office space&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Huang Weilai He said that while the decrease in rent costs is a good thing, it also reflects the downturn in the real estate industry. Huang Wei&#39;s entrepreneurial project involves architectural design, and the quality of his business is closely related to the ups and downs of the industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2019, Huang Wei returned to China from the Netherlands and worked successively in a European and American architectural design company and a local design studio. &quot;Party A is not doing well, and it is even more difficult for those who provide design services downstream. The number of projects that can be received has shrunk severely, and the industry is seriously involved. If you want to survive, you must either sink or shrink. Even if you can get orders, The price/performance ratio is also very low. Many of my classmates and friends have changed careers.&quot; In early 2022, Huang Wei and two other partners co-founded Miaoqi Design Studio. Faced with uncertainty and the threshold of 30 years old, Huang Wei still persistently wants to try again in the industry he loves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After starting a business for more than a year, he has been sharing his entrepreneurial experience on social media. This small office relocation incident was also edited into a short video by him. At the end of the video, he talked about his views on this &quot;uncertain era.&quot; Unexpectedly, this became one of his most watched videos recently. Private messages poured in like snowflakes. Many comments expressed their empathy for such sudden changes. Of course, there are more &quot;advertisers&quot; selling his office space to him. According to CBRE&#39;s forecast, the new supply of Shanghai&#39;s office market in the second half of 2023 is expected to exceed 950,000 square meters, the highest level in the past decade. Demand is weak, supply is increasing, and the office market is still in a slow recovery period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huang Wei quickly crossed the message board. The sudden closure of offices pales in comparison to the pressure to continue operations. His lease is signed until September 2024. 2023 is about to pass, and the intensity of competition in the industry is far more intense than last year. At the bidding meeting, master-level firms competed for it, and it has become very common to choose one of two to three hundred proposals. How about next year? He still &quot;has hope.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 18 Nov 2023 14:25:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[梁静茹演唱会“柱子票”案开庭：主办方是否应提前告知成焦点]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260853]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-18 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In May this year, many viewers reported that they bought &quot;pillar tickets&quot; at Leung Jingru&#39;s Shanghai concert, and the view was It was obscured by the pillars surrounding the stage, causing heated discussions.

The plaintiff&#39;s right to know was violated, resulting in the loss of the right to choose. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The defendant’s attorney said that the reason why the performance used load-bearing columns was because the venue’s ceiling was not load-bearing enough. Without the load-bearing columns on the ground, the performance would not have been able to be held normally and would not have passed the safety approval. So the ground load-bearing columns were used. Columns are also common practice in the industry. &quot;It is common sense that certain positions in the auditorium will inevitably block the view. The defendant has never deliberately mentioned in the publicity that there are no pillars or obstructions.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The plaintiff believes that the design and layout of the scene It should have been completed earlier. Before the concert begins, the organizer should also fulfill its corresponding responsibilities, inform consumers whose vision will be blocked, and ask them whether they want a refund or other solutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The defendant’s attorney stated that the defendant set up the stage mainly for safety reasons and did not intentionally deceive the audience. Moreover, this performance is the first stop of a series of tours, and they cannot be harshly criticized for considering so many things in advance. details. The response methods for other subsequent performances were improved after being affected by this performance. The first stop cannot be required based on the handling plan for subsequent performances; nor can it be considered that the defendant did not inform the defendant in advance just because the line of sight was blocked at some individual performances. There is an intention to deceive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At about 3 pm on the 15th, the trial of this case ended, but the verdict was not announced in court. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The China Consumers Association has criticized the phenomenon of &quot;pillar tickets&quot; by name&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Concert organizers have dealt with &quot;pillar tickets&quot; differently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Nandu previously reported that on August 14 this year, Shanxi Xingtai Lighting Culture and Entertainment Co., Ltd., the organizer of Jay Chou&#39;s 2023 Carnival World Tour Concert in Hohhot, issued an announcement saying that it would meet the needs of fans and allow more Fans can experience the joyful atmosphere of the concert live and reduce congestion outside the concert. After coordinating and fighting with all parties, the organizer will sell the seats with poor visibility in the area blocked by the sound console at a special discount. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the organizer stated in the announcement that the viewing angle of the seats in this area is affected by the sound console and is blocked to varying degrees. It is impossible to fully see the entire stage. A large screen is set up behind the sound console for the convenience of the audience. Watch, special discounted tickets are non-refundable and non-exchangeable after purchase. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 2, the China Consumers Association criticized the phenomenon of various &quot;pillar tickets&quot; and &quot;wall tickets&quot;, pointing out that consumers encountered &quot;blind selection&quot; of seats when purchasing performance tickets online, and some performance venues did not support consumption. The visitor chose his seat when purchasing the ticket, but when he arrived at the venue, he learned that what he had purchased was a &quot;pillar ticket&quot; or a &quot;wall ticket&quot; with blind spots, which caused a ticketing problem of &quot;only sounds but no people&quot; throughout the concert. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The China Consumers Association said that relevant performance ticketing platforms and organizers should consider how to better protect the rights and interests of consumers and improve the consumer experience from the perspective of promoting the release of consumption potential. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 18 Nov 2023 13:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[首位博士说 | 陈云生：宪法监督的研究任务依然任重道远]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260736]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-18 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Doctoral profile:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;Chen Yunsheng, the first Ph.D. in constitutional law in New China. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;Born in 1942 in Pinggu County, Beijing (now Pinggu District);&lt;/span >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;In 1966, graduated from the Law Department of Beijing Institute of Political Science and Law (now China University of Political Science and Law); worked in Guangxi after graduation Served in judicial, education, and administrative work; in 1978, he was admitted to the Law Department of the Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences for further study.

When I was a child, Confucius said, &quot;I am a young man, so I can do many despicable things.&quot; In addition to going to school, I had to help the family with work, planting fields, harvesting wild vegetables, chopping firewood, feeding pigs and cows, and I did all the work that rural children do. Pass. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When I was about to enter middle school, a junior high school was established in a neighboring village. Children from the eastern, southern and northern areas of Pinggu could go to school. As a result, after we registered, Found that there was only an open space. The first thing we do when we go to school is dig the foundation and build the house. It took more than half a year to have a classroom and a canteen, and a simple basketball court was built. The students borrowed villagers&#39; houses as dormitories and kitchens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, the school funds were not enough, and there happened to be a shoe factory that made cloth shoes, so we contracted part of the factory&#39;s projects. My shoemaking skills were relatively good, so I was made a supervisor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the high school entrance examination, the whole county accepted more than a hundred high school students. I was the first in the village to pass the high school entrance examination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the college entrance examination, only three subjects: mathematics, Chinese and chemistry. In the summer, I lay on the field or on the hillside and looked at the clear sky. Meteors came one after another, and the Milky Way was clearly visible. So when I applied for my college application, my first choice was the astronomy department, but only a few people were recruited, so I failed. Beijing University of Political Science and Law was my last choice. My grades were up to standard and I was admitted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In your time What is college like? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yunsheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I entered school in 1962. The schooling system was first 5 years and then changed to 4 years. , mainly studied political and legal subjects. In the first two years, he studied Marxism and criticized revisionism. During this period, he also organized a trip to Emei County, Sichuan (now Emeishan City) to carry out the &quot;Four Clean-ups&quot; movement. After graduating from college, I was assigned to Guangxi, but the receiving unit in Guangxi sent a telegram: &quot;Please postpone your registration.&quot; This was postponed for two years. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; When you went to Guangxi two years later, what impressed you most? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yunsheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I just arrived at my workplace in Guangxi. I haven’t settled in yet and haven’t unpacked my luggage yet. The leader organized employees to beat gongs and drums and send me to the countryside to receive education from poor and lower-middle peasants and undergo labor training. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I was assigned to a village on the China-Vietnam border, eating and living with farmers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I live on the lower floor of the building, with the soles of my feet facing the cowshed. The space under my bed is not wasted, and I have a litter of puppies, which are close to my ears. It&#39;s the chicken coop next door. At three or four o&#39;clock in the morning, a cow started to defecate. The smell of feces was steaming, and it immediately spread to the entire building. Then the dog under my bed also started to defecate. These are small things. I clean up dog excrement every morning. Cow dung smells bad, but it doesn’t touch my body. The most difficult thing is the rooster, which makes me unable to rest. &lt;p>; Like a decent and authentic farmer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;My biggest achievement in rural Guangxi is that I endured hunger and hardship, tempered my perseverance, and laid a solid foundation for my subsequent development in life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When did you decide to participate?

Although I went to college, I had no room for improvement and felt that my personal future was bleak. On the other hand, I have a strong sense of ruralism and cannot leave my hometown, so I still want to return to the north for development. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;One ​​day in 1977, my wife suddenly asked someone to bring me a message from the county seat, saying that the country wanted to recruit graduate students. I learned about it and it was indeed an opportunity. But I didn’t study very well in college. I stayed in the countryside for another 10 years without reading newspapers or listening to the radio. I thought at that time that the number of undergraduates we graduated in 1962 was more than 400. If we add those who graduated two or three years ago, there would be more than 1,000. Many of these people have married and established businesses, and many have become leaders and have stable incomes and families. Therefore, there are definitely not many people who applied for the exam, probably only a hundred or so. I decided to give it a try and reported it to the county leader. He was very supportive and let me go back to the county to prepare for the exam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After all, put down the book for ten How many years have passed, how to prepare for the exam? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yunsheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There was only two months of preparation time. The first problem was, I I can&#39;t find any books, especially no professional books to read. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another problem is English. The English I learned in college is basically wasted. I borrowed junior high school textbooks and started learning from ABCD. I was completely unsure. After studying for two or three months, I thought I had made some progress and was ready to take the exam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Then how to deal with it in the end What about the exam? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yunsheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The day before the exam, I was still memorizing textbooks, the 1975 Constitution and the Some newspaper articles. God helped me with the exam questions. I remember that the title of the essay at that time was &quot;Follow Chairman Hua on the New Long March&quot;, and the legal theory examination question only had five words - &quot;The French Civil War&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Leading the new Long March, the compositions are all relatively familiar political discourse. Naturally, whether it will be difficult for the candidates depends on their personal performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the preparation for the exam, I borrowed some Marxist-Leninist books. I have repeatedly read the articles about proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship in the book, such as &quot;Critique of the Gotha Program&quot; and &quot;The French Civil War&quot;, and have gained a lot of experience, so it is natural to answer the jurisprudence exam questions smoothly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I was left with no knowledge of English, so I was happy as soon as I opened the test paper. It was an English report from the &quot;People&#39;s Daily&quot; about learning from Dazhai in agriculture. I don’t speak English well, but I am very familiar with the feats of Dazhai people in transforming the world and the professional terms involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For example, if you were asked to translate &quot;seven ditches and eight beams&quot;, I don&#39;t know the English words for &quot;gou&quot; and &quot;liang&quot;, but when I saw &quot;seven (seven)&quot; )&quot; and &quot;eight&quot;, I immediately knew that this must be Qigou Baliang, and I passed the English test at this time. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;After the adoption of the 1982 Constitution, &quot;little fame&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font -family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Is life as a graduate student different from what you imagined? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yunsheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Goed to school on September 1, 1978, and registered at the Law Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Later, I discovered that there was no school building for graduate students. The school leaders went to Beijing Normal University to borrow space. We built a simple classroom with linoleum in the open space between other people&#39;s buildings, and borrowed the building to use as a dormitory, with 8 people in one room. This is how study and life at the postgraduate level are settled. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;More than a year later, the Graduate School of the Academy of Social Sciences also found it inconvenient, so they asked us to move out and live in Beijing No. 11 School again. go. Usually, we go to the School of Law of the Academy of Social Sciences for classes and come back after class. I study for 12 hours a day, exercise for 2 hours in the morning and evening, and sleep for 6 hours. After studying hard for three years, my academic performance was quite good, and the school leaders were quite satisfied with it. After graduating with a master&#39;s degree in 1980, I stayed at the law school to work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;This is related to undergraduate graduation Later I was assigned to work in rural areas of Guangxi, and my experience was completely different. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yunsheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;That’s true, especially when I entered the work and formulated 82 Working on the Constitution. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; What specific jobs have you been involved in? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yunsheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The work of amending the Constitution was mainly led by the then Deputy Chairman of the Legislative Affairs Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress. The director, Mr. Zhang Youyu, is in charge, and a secretariat is set up to be responsible for research and drafting work. At that time, Wang Shuwen, director of the Institute of Law of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, was a member of the Secretariat, so Zhang Youyu naturally handed over some of the academic research and data preparation work of the Secretariat directly to Wang Shuwen. Every time Wang Shuwen received a task, he hurried back to the law school and summoned all the staff to divide the work. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The five of us are generally not allowed to leave the unit and stick to our jobs 24 hours a day. As soon as they come, we are instructed to conduct research immediately and write research day and night. Report, at that time we could only take a brief rest in the office. It was late at night, and we bought a bowl of instant noodles to eat by ourselves. At that time, it was difficult to find information, and the academic world was in a state of desolation. There were books transferred from Tsinghua University and Peking University in the law school. No one had read them for more than 20 years. The dust was an inch thick, so I dug through the dust to look for information. From the beginning of preparations in 1980 to the completion of the constitutional amendment in 1982, we persisted in this way for more than two years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The process of constitution-making is complicated. We are only doing the most preliminary work. After the report is submitted, experts from the Secretariat will collect opinions from all parties and then bring it up to the leadership level. After the draft was passed, the People&#39;s Daily published a total of three solicitations for opinions. At that time, people were very enthusiastic about participation, and they may have hoped that through the formulation and implementation of the Constitution, the social disorder and national chaos like the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; could be ended forever. During the public participation in the discussion, more than 3,000 opinions were collected, and some people even suggested which words and punctuation should be used. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Participated in the formulation of the 1982 Constitution Has the related work had any impact on you personally? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yunsheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>; After the adoption of the 82 Constitution, the Constitution suddenly became a major event that attracted national attention. First of all, there was a lot of publicity. At that time, even &quot;little minions&quot; like me published hundreds of articles on tofu cubes in newspapers. Publishing houses have also requested manuscripts from us, from leaders to experts to little people like us. I was extensively involved in publishing dozens of pamphlets promoting the new constitution. In the process, I became &quot;a little famous&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Speaking of Mr. Zhang Youyu, what special impression do you have of him? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yunsheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Because of the amendment of the Constitution, I had contact with Mr. Zhang Youyu, who was eight years old at the time. When he was more than ten years old, he thought the articles I wrote were more interesting, so he liked to ask me to help him write manuscripts, and then he would revise them. I actually took on the job of his writing secretary. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Around 1982, leaders of the State Council advocated the cultivation of academic successors by several senior experts in the traditional &quot;master-apprentice&quot; format. Mr. Zhang Youyu chose me at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After more than a year of studying, the country changed the inherited master-apprentice model and officially changed it to a modern doctoral education system. I took the state-mandated doctoral examination, which included jurisprudence, constitutional law, English and politics. I was the only candidate and thus became his doctoral candidate. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;As a scholar, we must maintain a &quot;normal mind&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt; strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You studied constitutional law with Mr. Zhang. How did you later pay specific attention to constitutional supervision? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yunsheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Because after the implementation of the 1982 Constitution, it is only a textual legal provision. However, whether the implementation process of government agencies is just and rational, and whether the implementation and supervision mechanism of the Constitution are scientific, all need to be continued to study. Naturally, I entered into the study of the theory of constitutional supervision. Judicialization of constitutional supervision has been my main focus for more than ten years. I have published three books, one of which is my revised and expanded doctoral thesis. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The fate of constitutional law is to deal with the highest power of the country. At that time, I strongly advocated changing the Legal Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress into the Constitution and Law Committee. This was proposed by me, and was repeatedly demonstrated by generations of constitutional scholars. In 2018, the &quot;Constitution and Law Committee&quot; was finally established in the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you think about academics? Relations with politics? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yunsheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Academics cannot be separated from society, nor can they be completely isolated from politics. There are quite a few scholars who place their main academic interests and attention on directly serving real-life politics and law. This is understandable. Of course, people need to study practical problems. This is also a university knowledge, and it is a more difficult knowledge. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;>;The problem is that people who do this kind of knowledge should adjust their mentality. You must be mentally prepared that not all research reports and suggestions for improvement that address practical issues should or may be accepted and adopted by the relevant political decision-making bodies. We have said that theoretical conclusions and political decisions do not always coincide. Theoretically, it is necessary to study physics carefully and observe the subtle details, while in politics, it is necessary to weigh the pros and cons, pursue advantages and avoid disadvantages. The two stand on different positions and pursue different value goals, so the conclusions and decisions will naturally be different. As a scholar, it is important to maintain a &quot;normal mind.&quot; It is naturally a happy and encouraging thing to have your opinions adopted. Even if your opinions are not adopted, you should not feel disappointed or discouraged. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; As far as you&#39;re concerned, what&#39;s the fun in learning? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yunsheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;My book has been published. If someone reads it and experiences it, do you think it’s good? Just accept it, if it’s not good then reject it. However, we do not consider its impact when doing scholarship. That is a matter of whether contemporaries and future generations agree with it. It may be thirty or fifty years before anyone is interested in reading the book I wrote in depth. I know that at that time there was a scholar who had done such research and had such advanced ideological understanding. I don’t expect anyone of this generation to understand. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;>;Doing academic work is not only for gaining practical benefits, but also for learning. &quot;Liangzhizhi&quot; and a means to support my family. In addition to doing academic work, I also want to increase my knowledge. I groped forward according to my own research ideas, had the courage to explore, studied all my life, and was willing to be lonely. I would never be moved by the trend or follow the trend. So I laughed at myself at a certain society and said that I was a lonely ghost in the academic world. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;>;I just want to learn this knowledge thoroughly and achieve what I think As mature as you are, you can enjoy it. My students said that 30 years later, they are still studying the topic of &quot;constitutional supervision&quot; that I studied at the time. Because the research task of constitutional supervision has a long way to go. In my academic career, I have gone through a meaningful and tortuous path. If I can achieve the ultimate in this aspect of knowledge, it will be a blessing to be able to masturbate. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;&quot;For this reason I am&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong >;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Nowadays, young people, whether they are looking for a job or taking postgraduate entrance examinations, are facing fierce competition, and they are also relatively confused. . What advice do you have for young people? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yunsheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I have taught at Beijing Normal University for seven or eight years, and I have a deep understanding of this situation. When a master&#39;s degree or doctorate is admitted, the first thing to do is to take exams, such as judicial qualification certificate, computer certificate, IELTS, etc. You have to take five or six certificates in three years, so how can you have time to study and read? Now that you&#39;ve almost passed the certification exam, it&#39;s time to send out your resume and look for a job. He waited until two weeks before the defense of his master&#39;s thesis before he hurriedly put together the paper, and its quality can be imagined. I always tell students that if they study well, they will not have to worry about finding a job in the future, and gold will shine. This society must always be supported by people with knowledge and vision. But secondly, the competition in society is so fierce that people will be unemployed immediately after graduation. Nowadays, many people deliver food after graduating from Ph.D., which is very realistic. If you set your starting point so low in the beginning and just find a job to support your family, how can our society progress? In the past, we talked about &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;, but now I think it is &quot;I am, therefore I am&quot;. The reason why you are who you are is because of the things you have done. Personal self-realization and success always require a lot of effort or even a lifetime of effort. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you think of the current master&#39;s and doctoral training system? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yunsheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think our current training system is a kind of indoctrination education, and it is strict and strict. out. When I was studying for my Ph.D., the teachers only had one class every three to five weeks. They mainly relied on themselves to go out to listen to lectures and academic conferences, and tried their best to expand their knowledge. When I was studying in the United States, the school invited a professor from another school or our own school to give a keynote speech during lunch every day. Others listened while eating, or put down their knives and forks and raised their hands to ask questions, and no minute was wasted. Today’s students are also less active in participating in academic activities. Therefore, the main difference between the current and previous training models is that one is indoctrination and the other is heuristic; one is open and the other is closed. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 18 Nov 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[江苏205国道将收费引质疑：公共福利易涨难降，能否推进有待观察丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260825]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-18 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a toll station was built on the Huai&#39;an section of 205 National Highway in Suqian, Jiangsu, and the news that vehicle tolls will be collected soon has aroused social concern. great concern and doubt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to China Jiangsu Net, on October 20, the Jiangsu Provincial Government approved that after the Suhuai Toll Station of National Highway 205 is completed and meets the traffic conditions, it will be managed as a government loan repayment road and jointly operated by Suqian and Huaian. Charges have been set and the charging standards for various types of vehicles have been determined, ranging from 10 yuan to 50 yuan. Media reports indicate that the toll station has been built. This means that tolls may be activated on this section of the national highway at any time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;New toll stations on national highways! Many people believe that this is contrary to the country&#39;s policy of gradually canceling ordinary highway toll stations in recent years. However, the Jiangsu Provincial Transportation Department stated that the toll collection of first-class highways for which the government repays loans complies with the policy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the current &quot;Toll Road Management Regulations&quot;, roads constructed by the government using loans or paid funds raised from enterprises and individuals can collect tolls upon approval. The Suqian and Huai&#39;an sections of National Highway 205 were built with government loans. According to the Jiangsu Transportation Department, this section still has nearly 1 billion yuan in debt to be repaid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After sorting out the historical context of the Suhuai Toll Station on National Highway 205, we can find that the toll collection on this section is not a recent decision. In the early 2010s, the Suqian and Huai&#39;an sections of National Highway 205 were successively renovated and expanded and upgraded to first-class highways. In 2014, the Jiangsu Provincial Government approved in a document the establishment of a toll station at the junction of National Highway 205 Huai&#39;an and Suqian, and the two cities will jointly charge fees. In 2018, the Jiangsu Provincial Development and Reform Commission approved the feasibility report for the construction of the toll station. Today, the toll station is built and the provincial government issues documents approving the toll. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the minds of many people, only expressways still charge tolls, and all other ordinary highway toll stations have been abolished. However, in fact, there are not only ordinary highway toll stations, but they have increased in the past two years. According to information released on the official website of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Transportation, as of December 2022, there are still more than 10 national and provincial highway toll stations in Jiangsu Province. Also on National Highway 205, more than 90 kilometers north of Suhuai Toll Station, there is Xinyi Toll Station. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the National Toll Road Statistical Bulletin of the Ministry of Transport, at the end of 2021, there were 308 first-level highway main line toll stations and 115 second-level highway main line toll stations across the country. Compared with the end of the previous year, there were 308 second-level highway main line toll stations. The number of toll stations decreased by 7, but there were 8 more toll stations on first-class highways. The total mileage of tolled first-class highways was 17,600 kilometers, an increase of more than 200 kilometers over the previous year. Media reports show that since 2022, at least 7 new national highway toll stations have been added in various provinces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in recent years, it has become a trend to cancel tolls on ordinary highways. The central government has repeatedly proposed reducing road transportation costs and reducing road and bridge tolls. As early as 2009, the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Finance jointly issued a document calling for the gradual and orderly elimination of tolls on secondary roads for government loan repayment. The revised draft of the &quot;Toll Road Management Regulations&quot; released in 2018 stipulates that the construction of new first- and second-level toll roads and independent bridges and tunnels will be stopped, and only expressways can collect tolls. However, this revision has not yet been completed. In 2020, the General Office of the State Council forwarded the &quot;Implementation Opinions on Further Reducing Logistics Costs&quot; from the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Transport, once again requesting to ensure that the overall burden of truck tolls is not increased. Under these policies, a large number of toll plazas have been eliminated across the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Therefore, although Jiangsu&#39;s newly built 205 National Highway Suhuai Toll Station is not inconceivable, although the section of the road is based on loan renovation and charging loans at the beginning of the expansion. Loans, and there is still a huge loan, but it is not paid off, but at this moment. In the early 2010s, the first -level highway of the newly rebuilt charging charging was still allowed, but after a few years, the policy has shifted. Except for the highway, the central government has not encouraged or even clearly proposed to stop the first and second -level highways of new charges. Many places have also been revoked. A large number of toll stations on the first and secondary roads. Especially in the past one or two years, affected by the epidemic, the economy is recovering difficulties. In this situation, a new toll station has been added to increase the public&#39;s traffic costs. Of course, it will be questioned by the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Although there are no explicit regulations, &quot;national highways such as national highway should be free&quot; have become &quot;common sense&quot; in the public minds of the public, just like highway holidays for free. Once this psychological expectation is formed, if you want to reverse, of course, it will be questioned. Welfare from scratch, from nothing to difficult. From charges to free, from free to difficulties. Previously, the public would think that the public would benefit. But in turn, free of charge before, now they have to charge, everyone will feel that their own interests have been infringed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Not only is this public policy, but the same is true of the business field. From the beginning of the Internet, various services are almost free to ordinary users. Netizens are accustomed to enjoying free services. Once they start charges, they must pay for videos to use large -capacity, high -speed download network disks, and of course they will feel very uncomfortable. Broadband and data traffic has been charged from the beginning, and no one thinks these should be free. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But the real free lunch is actually not existing. To watch free videos, you must endure a lot of advertisements; if you use free network disks, you can only endure the download speed of the small water pipe. Similarly, public welfare also needs to pay for it. The national highway does not charge, and the cost of building and maintenance is indispensable. It can only be produced from fiscal revenue such as taxation, that is, the taxpayer is required to pay together. If the local government has enough fiscal revenue, it is certainly not a problem. However, if financial tensions are tight, I am afraid that it can only reduce the expenditure of road repair and raising, or the idea of ​​charging. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 205 National Highway Suhuai charges to prepare for charging at this time may have something to do with local financial difficulties in recent years. However, after attracting great attention and opposition, it remains to be observed whether it can continue to advance. Although Suqian and Huai&#39;an in northern Jiangsu, the economy is not so developed than the economy in the southern Jiangsu region, but compared with many places in the west, after all, it is still much prosperous. Caves. What&#39;s more, Jiangsu, as the second economic province in the country, should have enough financial resources to transfer and pay the place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, if the national highway and the provincial highway cannot be charged in the future, will the enthusiasm of the local government&#39;s new road will be greatly reduced? This is also worth paying attention to. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>; &lt;br>; &lt;hr>; &lt;div>; Get more RSS: &lt;br>; &lt;a href = &quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style = &quot;color: orange&quot; target = &quot;_blank&quot;>; https://feedx.net &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;cone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>; https: // feedx.

The city has the best coffee in Italy, and the headquarters of &quot;Illy&quot; is here. Like many cities that have been silent after glory, half of the city is reality, half of the text. Riyaster used to be the most important port of the Austro -Hungarian Empire, where the blend of Slavic, Latin and Germanic culture. More than a hundred kilometers away, Venice maintained the world&#39;s attention in a glittering way. Although each stone that built her is from other places, all beauty is artificially beautiful, but at first glance in Venice, it will make it to let the first glance of Venice will make People are amazing and obsessed. In comparison, Riyaster is a dusk city. She is located in the northeast of Italy. It is Slovenia, facing the sea, leaning against the Karst mountain rocks. There are many deep house courtyards on the mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The British James Morris, who was once a soldier here -later, became Jane Morris. After World War II, she wrote a full -time writing, became a reporter from the Guardian, and a famous travel writer. In her &quot;Trieste and the Meaning of Nowhere&quot;, Riyaster is an unforgettable city. The face. The city has no unforgettable landscape, no unique cuisine, and even no Italian color. In a survey in 1999, even 70%of Italians did not know it belonged to Italy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Nevertheless, Riyaster also has her unique charm. This former free port, in the last century, in the dispute between Yugoslavia and Italy, chose to enter Italy. The chaotic past can stimulate people&#39;s imagination and reflection. She is more literary than any other cities. At the beginning of last century, Joyce lived in many places in this city. He was an English teacher and began to write &quot;Ulysses&quot; here. At the time, there were many artists and writers who gathered in the wine. For him, Riyaster was a place where he was particularly liver. Joyce and the gloomy ITALO &amp; Nbsp; Svevo encouraged the Jewish merchant to write, and highly respected his &quot;Zeno&#39;s Consciousness&quot;. Svevo&#39;s text has a relatively slow st for Italian. Most of the texts are a businessman who is torture his conscience, which complements the thought of conscious novels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The literature of this city also has a continuity. The contemporary Riyaster writer Claudio &amp; Nbsp; Magris also has the depression of Savid. It is not surprising that German translates into Italian, because Magris is a professor of German literature at the university. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Writers want to present a city, it is actually difficult to reach her spirit and soul. Magris has been talking about this land. As the most important seaport of the Austro -Hungarian Empire, Riyaster&#39;s once brilliant history made her currently dim, and the whole city was shrouded in a twilight. Magris&#39;s writing is a pursuit of the tradition of Lyaster literature in a sense, and it is also a kind of attempt close to real. His &quot;Micro World&quot;, which won the &quot;Straiga&quot; award but is incredible, has many texts related to the space of the city and past literature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A person&#39;s life experience is limited, and it is difficult to conclude a profound connection with the vast world. Sociologist Xiang Biao proposes the concept of &quot;nearby sex&quot;. Magris is a model of practicing &quot;nearby sex&quot;. He lives in this city, understands here with a tenacious scholar, and go deep into his life here. His &quot;miniature world&quot; is actually composed of cafes, parks, and Shengxintang. After reading his &quot;micro -world&quot;, and then seeing San Marco cafe, parks and the Holy Heart Hall nearby, you will recognize every thing, and think that the world is what he described. The St. Marco Cafe in 1914 opened in 1914. The ceiling is extremely high. There are leaves and coffee beans on the top. The ebony bar and the walls of the wall stand steadily standing there. You will recognize the mask behind the counter. The golden coffee machine identified by the Flying Eagle, the lion -shaped table legs under the table, reminiscent of Venice&#39;s sacred Marco. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The ancient coffee shop in the city resisted the times in its own way. At the San Marco cafe, the bar is still dignified dark wood, and the decoration on the tables and chairs and walls is still a hundred years ago. Its &quot;L&quot; structure, one of which has been transformed into a bookstore, full of nostalgic books. The most conspicuous place is Margiris&#39;s &quot;Mini World&quot;, which are dozens of pages in this book describing the past and present of the St. Marco Cafe. The cafe is the living room of the city. An open public space, some faces have disappeared, and new faces appear. In this city space, the history of literature is recorded. The San Marco Cafe is a place where the &quot;Xiangke&quot; of literature is often gone. Everyone hopes that the &quot;Ark&quot; of this culture will exist in their own way. In addition to drinking coffee, this cafe can also eat delicate pasta. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Out of the cafe, you can go to a nearby park to take a walk to breathe. The park is a towering French sycamore. The sun is sprinkled from the leaves, and the golden light is shining, falling in a pool in the garden, which is described by Magris. There are bench everywhere in the garden. People read newspapers, read books, or just sit away. In the innermost of the park, there are children&#39;s playgrounds and an open -air cinema. There are statues of city celebrities scattered around. There is a half -body statue of Joyce wearing a hat and glasses. It was stood at his century in 1982 and the half of the local poet Saba. Patients with neurological disorder, also the cultural soul of Riyaster, once wrote a poem entitled &quot;Riyaster&quot;: &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: Kai style , Kaiti_GB2312, Stkaiti; &quot;>; I through the whole city, &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style =&quot; font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti; &quot;>; climb a big one Slope, &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; It was congested first, and then the road was swinging. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; The end of the road is a low wall: span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; I sit alone in this small corner. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; The end of the dwarf wall, &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;span stylele = &quot;FonT-FAMILY: Kai, Kaiti_GB2312, Stkaiti;&quot;>; is also the place where the city is over. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; Riyaster has a kind of beauty that is difficult to approach. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; If you like it, this city is like a rough, &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt; p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; Greedy wild children, &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: Kaiti_Tai style GB2312, Stkaiti; &quot;>; Blue eyes, use a pair of too large hands &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style =&quot; font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti; &quot;>; Send it out A flower; &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; love. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; On this hillside, I see the city (Riyaster) &lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/ span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; Each church, every street, or even crowded beach, &lt;/span>; &lt;/ P>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; And the top of the mountain with all stones &lt;/span>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;fontt -Family: Kai style, Kaiti_GB2312, Stkaiti; &quot;>; The standing house, the last one seems to be firmly rooted there. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; Everything around you &lt;/span>; &lt;pan style = &quot;FONT-FAMILY: Kaita, Kaiti_GB2312, Stkaiti;&quot;>; There is a strange, tortured feeling, &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;FONT-FAMILY: Kai style, Kaita body, Kaiti style _Gb2312, stkaiti; &quot;>; This is the breath of my hometown (this is where I was born). &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; Each part of my city is vibrant &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; She retains me a corner, suitable for me &lt;/span>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body style , Kaiti_GB2312, Stkaiti; &quot;>; Think and lonely life. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Everyone lives in the corner of the city, including poets like Saba. There are beaches and hills in this city, so there is a hint of the countryside. Looking at life at heights, but not participating in life, and at the same time, I do n’t feel like an outsider. This is exactly what the city was given to Saba. Magris lives in this city in another way. He exists in a strict ritual, as cautious and solemn as the black and white floor of the Holy Heart Hall. For him, everything is nearby, and it is close at hand. It is like a weekly tour of the world. The clear sanctuary pool of the Holy Heart Hall is like Xiaoquan in the forest open space. The dark light of the church is as deep as the sea at night. Unfathomable. His life penetrates in San Marco Cafe, Street Heart Park, and the two -step Holy Heart Hall, Magris even designed a peaceful ending for himself: under the consolation of the two sons, in the Holy Heart In the golden sky described by the hall, two angels were skipped in the fire circle in his hand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The Riyaster in Magris is a dusk city. In 2019, he published &quot;Krems&#39; Bend time&quot; at the age of 80. This is a twilight -filled book. There are five short stories in the book, telling the story of five twilight men. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the &quot;Gongwen&quot; is an old man who retreats, a president of the company who once owned several companies. He entered an unknown field to get rid of the reality of facing the enemy. He is the Czech -developed Czech who came from inland. The youthful time is beautiful and big in the world. He successfully played his role, using checks and profits to build a strong armor for himself. However, one day, he left him with the desire for success and his inner panic. He became relaxed, sold his own company, and became a apartment&#39;s door with a calm mood. Once the sea returned to the water again. In the morning, he tried to bypass the road where he could see the sea, took the bus, and walked to work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The protagonist of &quot;Music Course&quot; is a Jewish Jewish who entered the twilight years. A survivor with shameful ashamed. He took a car to go up the mountain and go to his former student&#39;s house. The student became a master of music and showed him a piece of music he wrote, which was sorrowful to the tragedy of the Jews, and he also accepted the song frankly in embarrassment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The protagonist in &quot;Crees&#39;s Bending Time&quot; is the closest to Magris. He made a Kafka lecture to have dinner in a city named Krems. At the dinner, some people mentioned the goddess of his youth. Coincidentally, he later contacted her. &quot;Now&quot; has changed &quot;before&quot;, and time becomes bent, leaving only &quot;he &quot;&#39;s thoughts on the god of godlings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Awards&quot; is an old writer to participate in a literary awards ceremony. There is a kind of puppet and relief of the passage of years. &quot;Outside Day&quot; is also an old man who goes to the crew to see the actor of his young age. Everything is different from the previous story, and the old man gets a kiss that he missed when he was a teenager. The five life clips are all by the theme of &quot;old age&quot;, which makes people see the scene of the dusk of the city reflected in life: the sunset is full of relief. Magris accurately outlines some life fragments in a short text. In the past and present at the same time, death became infinitely soft. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In addition to Magris, there is a world -class best -selling female writer Susana Tamaro. 》. It was also a twilight woman to make a liquidation of the past era by letters. In addition, there is a recent writer who has been introduced to the country, Jenfrando Caligaric, who has a certain connection with Riyaster. He was born in Asmara in Elitia, Africa, and his family was the &quot;worldist&quot; of Riyaste&#39;s past, and he had a trace of mixed nation in the city. He lived and worked in Milan and Rome. In 1974, he wrote a praise of &quot;Summer Summer&quot;. In the style, there was a trace of youth that could not be erased, and it still exudes endless charm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>; &lt;br>; &lt;hr>; &lt;div>; Get more RSS: &lt;br>; &lt;a href = &quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style = &quot;color: orange&quot; target = &quot;_blank&quot;>; https://feedx.net &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;cone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>; https: // feedx.

If you do n’t find a book one day, you will feel fragrant when you sleep. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A few years ago, most of the books I read relied on my son to borrow from the college library. My son&#39;s university is studying locally. This is a great benefit to me, that is, I can use the university library as my own private library. This is all stained with the light of the son. Now that my son graduated from university, I have been working on a job, and I have lost that convenient reading condition. After my son left school, the source of the book was broken. I had to turn the box at home to pour the cabinet and start the idea of ​​collecting books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The collection of books at home is too limited to meet my needs. The days when there is no book can be read, I feel particularly long, and it seems to have a sense of inferiority. Xiao Xu called at this time, and I wanted to send a book. As I felt like, I felt like I couldn&#39;t always owe the feelings of others. Now that the book price is high, Xiao Xu is just a working class. How can he always make people spend? No matter how iron is the relationship, there must be a scalp. So I thought that if there is a place to borrow books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In fact, there is no borrowing book office. The library in the city can be borrowed, but it is a bit regrettable. The place is not close to home, there are more than ten miles back and forth. In this way, it is natural to think that if it can be borrowed near the home, isn&#39;t it good to borrow a book? Such as the library of the community. But I couldn&#39;t find such a place, asked people, and said I have never heard of it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The son joked that we would buy it near the library in the future. Even if this joke can come true, it is far from the water. It is said that it is difficult to create a book incense society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I admit that there are fewer and fewer people who read paper books now. But even so, there are still public services that should be there, and there must be no less. We often say that we need to carry out bottom -type assistance to difficult groups, and there must be bottom -type assistance in reading, because there are always people who can&#39;t afford too much books, and some people always face the high book price. Even if you ca n’t help but do it, you can only endure love. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Let reading enter our daily life and become an important part of life, thereby improving the quality of individual literacy and the population quality of the entire society. This is the fundamental point of creating a scent of society. Not to mention anything else, just to this, we also need to have a place to make people borrow nearby. Such a place does not need to be large, and it can provide convenience for people. At least one community neighborhood committee must have such a place. The large community must determine the number of places according to the population distribution, and in order to save costs, books can be regularly circulated between different places, so as to maximize the use of books and maximize satisfaction to the greatest extent. The needs of lovers. I don&#39;t know if such desires can be implemented in reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; (the author is Anqing City, Anqing City) &lt;/p>; &lt;pan style = &quot;color: #ba1010;&quot; &quot; >; • &lt;/span>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>; (Southern Weekend APP &quot;Hi, Southern Week&quot; section is looking forward to your manuscript.

It&#39;s like a big dream. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In early April and early September 2023, in early spring and early autumn, I went to Niigata Prefecture in northern Japan twice, the Echigo country that often appears in ancient Japanese literature. Echigo Kingdom, one of the ancient &lt;span>;Reiji Kingdom&lt;/span>; in Japan, faces the &lt;span>;Sea of ​​Japan&lt;/span>; and is long and narrow from north to south. &lt;span>;Meiji&lt;/span>; Four years later, the feudal domain was abolished and a prefecture was established, named Niigata. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Niigata in April, the car was driving among the continuous farmland. The brown rice fields in early spring have just been plowed and are waiting for a new round of sowing. The September trip is already in my plan, so I started imagining the scene of autumn. For large areas of solid color scenes, yellow is the most suitable, and the combination with the blue sky is pure and gorgeous. In the Chengdu Plain where I live, there is a spectacular scene every day in March. The spread of rapeseed flowers is spectacular, and the atmosphere of early spring is quite exciting. Chengdu people who stay at home will basically go out for spring outings at this time, not to let down nature or themselves. Fortunately, I visited Niigata again in early September and enjoyed the sight of golden rice fields and blue sky. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many swans in Niigata’s deserted fields in April. They are pecking at the grain that falls in the soil. After being fed and fattened, they will fly back to Siberia. It migrates like this every year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Look at these beautiful big white birds from a distance. Has Basho seen them? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Probably not. Matsuo Basho and his disciple Soryo Kawai arrived in Echigo in the summer of 1689. Echigo is a stop on the &quot;Oku no Hosomido&quot;. The entire &quot;Oku no Homichi&quot; journey is a total of 2,400 kilometers of hiking. Starting from Edo, go north, then turn west. It is said that the most magnificent journey is the monk Kukai’s tour of the eighty-eight temples in Shikoku. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the trip to Japan in the spring of 2023, the excitement and yearning were mixed with a different state of mind from the trips in previous years. During the three years of the epidemic, except for a few short trips within the country, I have not traveled abroad. Three years of isolation has had a psychological effect on me, leaving me with a faint uneasiness, but I don’t know where this uneasiness comes from. When applied to the body, the hands and feet feel sluggish and sluggish. Having been separated from the same rhythm for three years, the effect is really powerful. The body is heavy and the state of mind is also sinking. I asked myself, what would happen if I never went out again? It seems to be possible. For middle-aged people, three years makes them look older. This is probably an important reason. By September, after a trip to Japan in April, a self-driving trip to Yunnan in May, and several short trips, I felt that my mind and body were beginning to adapt to the journey again, which was very gratifying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My friend Ding Yuan settled in the village of &lt;span>;Niigata Prefecture&lt;/span>; and ran a B&amp;B called &quot;Four Seasons Inn&quot; with her husband, Mr. Nakamura Tatsuo. The couple also ran a local hotel. Various contents of travel. Regarding Basho, what Ding Yuan helped me find out is that Basho and Zeng Liang stayed in Murakami for two nights and three days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Basho accommodation in Murakami can be checked and determined based on local literature, but it has lost its former appearance and has become a salmon restaurant, so the curtain at the door is very interesting. This is a two-story Japanese-style house on Murakami Street. Three Japanese-style curtains are hung side by side at the door. They are written in black on a white background and &quot;Izutsuya&quot; is written in the middle. This is the name of the restaurant. The one on the right is written &quot;Murakami&quot;. &quot;Salmon Cuisine&quot; and a book on the left reads &quot;Basho&#39;s Staying Place&quot;. There is a wooden sign at the door stating, &quot;In June of the second year of Genroku (1689), Basho and Zeng Liang arrived at Murakami during their journey on the &#39;Ok no Homichi&#39;. They stayed here for two nights and three days. , it was called &#39;Sukuzaemon&#39; at the time.&quot; In order to show that the brand was not the store&#39;s own words, the signature was &quot;Mura City Education Committee.&quot; Murakami&#39;s salmon industry is very famous. Every year, many salmon migrate here, and the output and quality are of high quality. Therefore, Murakami has a considerable number of salmon restaurants and processing workshops for curing and drying salmon. I asked Nakamura, is &quot;Izutsuya&quot; the most famous salmon shop in Murakami? Nakamura smiled and said, that&#39;s not necessarily true. It&#39;s because of the influence of bananas, but most people don&#39;t care about this, and only you cultural people care about it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/17/MQzAIBoCpFBy1l4BFMplWcHVyGjQuJFUl4plJrQa.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/17/MQzAIBoCpFBy1l4BFMplWcHVyGjQuJFUl4plJrQa.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258620&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Matsuo Basho and his disciple Kawai Sora went to the accommodation in the village. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the author)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Basho wrote in &quot;The Thirty-Five Echigo Road&quot; in &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot; , &quot;As soon as we passed the Mouse Pass, we entered the territory of Echigo from Dewa, and then we rushed to Shizhen Pass in Etchu. We walked for nine days in total. During this period, sometimes the heat was unbearable, and sometimes the cold rain poured down on us, which made us physically and mentally exhausted. Even getting sick was really miserable. So I didn’t record much of my journey.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps because Basho was ill during Echigo, there are very few records about Echigo in &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot;. Based on the results that Ding Yuan helped me check, I followed the traces in Murakami in early spring and early autumn. However, it is no longer possible to determine the location of this trace. We can only search for it based on the location of the Basho Sentence Monument. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Jizo-do Hall in Kamikata Town has the Basho sentence monument &quot;けふはかり人も年よれ&amp;nbsp;First Time Rain&quot;. It can be translated as: Only today do you know that you are old, this is the first shower. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Inari Shrine has a Basho motto stone, &quot;Cloud folds 々人をやすむる月见かな&quot;. The general meaning I understand is that the shadow of the cloud covers the moon, and the shadow of the moon covers the person. The latter is a sentence from Basho&#39;s seven-part collection &quot;Spring Day&quot;, written in 1685. Basho visited Murakami in August 1689. He probably left no works due to poor health. Next to the Bajiao Monument Monument, there is a haiku poet Su Xian&#39;s Monument Stone. The handwriting is blurry. The general idea I read is: Under the moonlight, the shore of the water is covered with pine leaves like umbrellas (I don&#39;t know if it is correct or not). According to the introduction on the standing plaque next to it, these two stone sentences were erected in October 1843, during the 150th anniversary of Basho and the 17th anniversary of Susen. The introduction also specifically said that there are two important remains of Basho in Murakami, one is the Inari Shrine where this place is located, and the other is the Iwafune Shrine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Iwafune Shrine built on the seaside is much larger in scale and momentum than the Inari Shrine. It has a red torii gate and a white torii gate. In front of the red torii gate, there is a Basho sentence stone, which is engraved with the sentence &quot;On the seventh day of Hanasaki, Tsurumi will see Tsuruga&quot;, which can be understood as &quot;The cherry blossoms are in full bloom in seven days, and only Tsurumi can see such a beautiful scenery.&quot; The Basho stone in front of the white torii gate is engraved with &quot;Bunzuki や六日も常の夜には思ず&quot;, which means that the night of Bunzuki (July), when I am anxiously waiting for the letter, is also different from the ordinary night. The former Basho haiku has nothing to do with &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot;, and the latter line is taken from a line written in the Hokuriku section of &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April, the day before Basho’s tour in &lt;span>;Niigata Prefecture&lt;/span>;, we went to Kameoka Monju-in, the Daishoji Temple in Yamagata Prefecture. In the drizzle, there was still residual snow on the mountain col in the distance and on the roofs nearby. When I was going down the mountain, I suddenly found a Basho sentence monument standing on the roadside, which read &quot;春の夜は桜に明けてしまひけり&quot; (Spring night, cherry blossoms are in full bloom). Tateishiji Temple (Mountain Temple) in Yamagata Prefecture is an important place to visit on the &quot;Oku no Hosōdo&quot; tour of Master Basho and his apprentice. I visited in 2019. I don’t know if they have been to the Great Holy Temple, and it is not mentioned in the book. Someone may have studied the details of these travels, and the results of these studies must be carefully explored to know. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I used to read a lot of haiku in Chinese translation, but over the years I slowly started to read the original haiku. It is true that poetry cannot be translated. Because my Japanese foundation is still shallow, and it also involves issues of ancient and modern Japanese, I can only read these haiku at a loss. But maybe it was in this confusion, after leaking some clear information, that I finally understood the extremely concise and complex semantics of haiku. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The highlight of Basho&#39;s activities in this area of ​​​​Murakami is Otohoji Temple. During my two trips to Murakami in early spring and early autumn, I went to Otohoji Temple twice. The cherry blossom scenery in early spring is obviously much more beautiful than the scenery in early autumn before the red leaves appear. It is said to be Murakami, but Otohoji Temple is actually located in Tainai City next to Murakami. This temple was built in the 8th century AD under the order of Emperor Shomu who was in office at the time. The temple covers a vast area of ​​more than 80,000 square meters. There is a &quot;three-story pagoda&quot; built in 1620 in the temple, which is designated as a national important cultural property of Japan. This temple is the only ancient temple in Shinji that is included in &quot;The Story of Konsai&quot;, and it is also the temple where Matsuo Basho once visited when he wandered the &quot;Oku no Hosho Road&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/17/vg13uYiV1rkOS05OOYFWHKCIRA8y6dKAOdlxPhPL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/17/vg13uYiV1rkOS05OOYFWHKCIRA8y6dKAOdlxPhPL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258621&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Matsuo Basho Monument in Otohoji Temple. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the author)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the topic, let me say a few words. It was almost noon after visiting Otohoji Temple in early autumn. Mr. Nakamura said that there was a steamed bun shop next to it that was very delicious and he hadn’t eaten there in a long time. We decided to leave it at that for lunch. When I arrived at the door, I looked at the description and found that it was founded in the first year of culture, which was 1804, and has a history of more than 200 years. The shop is really small, with a few stools and two or three tables. When the steamed buns arrived, they turned out to be red bean paste buns. Later, I looked up information and learned that in Japan, the so-called steamed buns are bean paste buns, and the outer shell can vary. There are white steamed buns made of commonly used flour, brown tea steamed buns made of wheat flour, and sweet potato flour, yam flour, and japonica rice flour. There are sweet potato steamed buns and wine steamed buns made from fermented rice flour, etc., but they are filled with red bean paste. Yiboji Steamed Buns are delicious, and I am even more impressed that such a snack shop has a history of more than 200 years. In Japan, I often come across various small shops that are hundreds of years old. I once ate at a ramen shop in Kyoto. When I came to the door after eating, I was shocked to see the signboard. It has a history of more than 400 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I posted photos of my visit to Yibao Temple in WeChat Moments, and a friend asked: Is it the Yibao Temple in &quot;The Story of the Past&quot;? It seems that its name first came from &quot;The Story of the Past&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Story of the Past&quot; is a collection of folklore stories from the late Heian period in Japan, with a total of thirty-one volumes and more than a thousand stories. It is divided into Tianzhu (India) (volumes one to five), Cathay (China) (volumes six to ten), and Honchao (Japan) (volumes eleven to thirty-one). The current Chinese version of this Dynasty was edited by Zhou Zuoren. The stories in &quot;The Tale of the Past&quot; are all-encompassing, with Buddhist stories and secular stories mixed together. There are also many stories of gods and supernatural beings. Many creations of later generations come from this book, which is one of the source treasures of Japanese literature. It is similar to Chinese books such as San Yan Er Pai and Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio. Because each volume contains the word &quot;present and past&quot; at the beginning, it is called &quot;The Story of Present and Past&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among Japanese writers, Ryunosuke Akutagawa made full use of &quot;The Story of Konsai Monogatari&quot;. It is said that about one-fifth of the material in the historical novels he created came from &quot;The Story of Konsai Monogatari&quot;, including &quot;Rason&quot; Door&quot; and &quot;In the Jungle&quot;. Ryunosuke Akutagawa called &quot;The Story of Konsai Monogatari&quot; a &quot;human comedy&quot; in ancient Japan. He said that &quot;The Story of Konsai Monogatari&quot; is full of &quot;wild beauty&quot; and is &quot;a kind of beauty that has nothing to do with elegance and luxury.&quot; Many of the common Onmyodo and Onmyoji content in Japanese animations also come from &quot;Kanagi Monogatari&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the spacious garden of Uhoji Temple, there is a Basho Sentence Monument, a round stone monument, the handwriting has been blurred. There is a wooden sign next to the stele, which records the content of this stele: &quot;In the second year of Genroku (1689), Matsuo Basho paid homage to the Ukiyo no Kita no Mountain Sakura Basho&quot; (The cherry blossoms of Kitayama, this floating world scenery makes I envy). Surrounding the Basho Sentence Monument are many echoing sentences from &lt;span>;Niigata&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;local&lt;/span>; haiku celebrities at that time. Otohoji Temple has been a famous place for cherry blossom viewing since ancient times. Basho admired the beauty of the northern cherry blossoms here, even though it was not during the cherry blossom season when he visited. Looking at Sakura Leaves, he also expressed his envious mood in his imagination. Two of the echoing haiku of other haiku writers were singled out and written in the description of the stele. They were probably the most famous haiku poets in the area at that time. One of them is not jade, &quot;Mitsukoshi Road や一の Temple の花ざかり&quot;, Mitsukoshi The road and Yi&#39;s Temple are filled with flowers. One song is by Yasuda Izabo, &quot;Different gods and Buddhas&quot;. Different gods and Buddhas all have the beauty of cherry blossoms. They are all sentences praising cherry blossoms. In Japan, the word flower, if not specifically mentioned, is cherry blossom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Niigata in early April, the cherry blossoms are in full bloom in previous years, but the spring of 2023 is coming fiercely, and when we arrived, the cherry blossoms were already a little overdue. In the garden of Otohoji Temple, on the round stone monument of Basho, there are several branches of cherry blossoms hanging down, on the eve of their withering. Behind the stele is a small hill, and on the steps are several red curtains from the temple, with the words &quot;Namo Guanyin Bodhisattva&quot; enshrined. The curtains fluttered gently in the sunshine and breeze. This sentiment and scene complement each other perfectly with the haikus tablet with unclear handwriting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Othoji Temple, like other Niigata landscapes, has very few tourists. I stood on the terrace outside the main hall, watching the yin and yang scene cut by the sun with the Buddha statues in the garden below. I have done this twice. Although the weather seems to be the same, there are obvious differences in the dividing lines between sunlight and shadow in early spring and early autumn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I visited Otohoji Temple again in September and suddenly discovered Kobo Daishi (Kukai) here. I didn’t notice it at all on that trip in April. There is a stone statue of Kobo Daishi Gozun here, which is a common standard shape of Kukai wearing a hat and leaning on a staff during his journey. This stone statue of Kukai is a bit cute, shaped into a pudgy little boy. I turned to the back of the base of the stone statue to read the description. The handwriting was a bit blurry, but I could clearly see the words &quot;Pursuing the eighty-eight sacred sites of Shikoku...to commemorate...&quot; and other words. It is estimated that someone went there before and erected a statue in Otohoji Temple after returning to Niigata. Benji was the monk Kukai&#39;s practice route. It later gradually became the most famous hiking route in the world, with a total length of more than 1,400 kilometers and 88 temples in Shikoku. Currently, more than half a million people from all over the world walk this road every year. This is also a strange fate for us. After seeing Kukai at Otohoji Temple, my friend Dr. Tan Weidong and I left Niigata the next day, flew to Osaka for a short stay, and then headed to Shikoku to start our plan Three years of preparation for the trip. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 17 Nov 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
