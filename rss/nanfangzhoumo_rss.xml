If the new construction site hadn&#39;t happened to be near a subway station, Uncle Chen wouldn&#39;t have walked in, even though it was Tiyu West Road, the largest subway station in Asia that handles nearly a million passengers every day. Because he still hasn&#39;t understood the rules of taking the subway. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally arrived at the platform of Tiyu West Road Station. Uncle Chen was carrying a bag of quilts in one hand and a bucket in the other hand, which contained towels, shower gel and other daily necessities, and asked the strangers around him for directions. ——He was going to take the subway to work near Shipaiqiao subway station, which was just one stop away. Uncle Chen is from Hubei. He and his wife rent in Fushan Village, Huangpu District, more than 30 kilometers away from the center of Guangzhou. He usually works as a temporary worker at construction sites in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai and other places. The nearest subway station is 3 kilometers away from his residence. When he goes to work, he usually takes a bus or a taxi, even though the former is a long journey and the latter is expensive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“You can’t ride the subway for long, and it’s very troublesome to go around in circles.” Uncle Chen said. His two daughters worked outside the home, and no one taught him how to confirm the route, transfer trains, or find the station. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/ZOmMx5fvos11SE1narzVKAxCdNCwHi2GycsiJY95.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height= &quot;683&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/ZOmMx5fvos11SE1narzVKAxCdNCwHi2GycsiJY95.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254371&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In June 2023, at Xiuyi Station of Suzhou Rail Transit Line 11, citizens were checking the subway line map and buying tickets by themselves. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhou Heng, who is studying urban rail operation management at an engineering college in Hunan, is about to graduate. Just took the subway for the first time. In the first month of college, the teacher asked in class if any students had never taken the subway. There were 42 people in the class, and one-third of them raised their hands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Out of surprise, the teacher asked a girl who had ridden the subway to share her feelings. The girl said that the subway was fast, comfortable and convenient. &quot;I was very envious at the time. I had never seen this thing before,&quot; Zhou Heng said. In his hometown and the city where he goes to school, public transportation is not very developed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, teachers still asked the same questions in class from time to time, but almost no one raised their hands anymore. &quot;At that time, I was actually too embarrassed to admit it,&quot; Zhou Heng said, &quot;After all, I learned this by myself.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first time Zhou Heng walked into a subway station was when he traveled to Nanchang with his classmates in his sophomore year. He found that the subway was a little different from what he imagined. It was not as quiet and comfortable as the girl described. It was very crowded during rush hours, the carriages vibrated obviously, and it was very noisy while driving. But he was still very interested and curiously paid attention to the layout of the station and the location of the escape routes. After arriving at the station, they remembered the subway driving process they had just learned in class, and stayed on the platform for a while, waiting to see the driver come out of the cockpit after the door closed, get out of the car, check, and then return to the car. They also took photos. Send the video to the teacher. &quot;The teacher praised us for being studious,&quot; Zhou Heng said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;You are 20 years old and have never taken the subway. Are you a failure?&quot; This is one of the most popular comments on David&#39;s video. He made a short video of the process of taking the subway and taught others how to transfer and find the station on social media. There are many &quot;traffic bloggers&quot; similar to him. Search for &quot;subway riding tutorial&quot; and the city name on the short video platform to find subway teaching videos in various cities. If you still don&#39;t understand, you can ask questions in the comment area. , and received precise answers from bloggers and enthusiastic netizens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Type &quot;how many people in China have never taken the subway&quot; in the search engine, and the answer is &quot;900 million&quot; (Editor&#39;s note: As of September 2023, the 2022 permanent population of all cities in mainland China with subway access The total is 499 million). What does a subway mean to the silent majority? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Those who have never ridden the subway know nothing”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;For many people who have never ridden the subway, the first thing to break through is the psychological barrier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ronaldiner works in Chengdu, and his parents have been working in Aba Prefecture, Sichuan for a long time. During the Chinese New Year in 2023, Ronaldinho asked her mother to accompany her from Chengdu to Chongqing. When she proposed to take the subway to the high-speed rail station, her mother refused and asked for a taxi. Ronaldinho didn&#39;t understand that taking a taxi was expensive and crowded, so he argued with his mother. In the end, her mother was a little embarrassed and said that she had never taken the subway and didn&#39;t know how to take it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ronaldiner said simply: &quot;Then I will teach you.&quot; The mother was stunned for a moment, as if she was surprised that her daughter did not laugh at her. The dispute ended with Ronaldinho convincing his mother to accept the instruction. The two rehearsed the entire process at the entrance. The mother asked many questions: how to apply for the bus code and how to use it; water bottles, sunscreen spray, fruit knife, red wine Can I bring a bottle opener? The two of them squatted on the ground and took out the items in the suitcase one by one and counted them. &quot;I was shocked at the time. My mother really didn&#39;t understand this aspect at all. I felt like I didn&#39;t even understand her life.&quot; Ronaldinho said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After getting on the subway, my mother became taciturn. When Ronaldinho explained the details of the ride to her, he just responded with a &quot;hmm&quot;. &quot;She would have a lot of questions before getting on the bus, but when she got inside, although she wanted to ask, she was too embarrassed to ask, so she didn&#39;t speak.&quot; She silently sent a text to Ronaldinho on WeChat, asking when and when she got off the bus. How to go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After scanning the QR code and exiting the station, my mother opened Alipay and found that only a few yuan had been deducted. She was surprised and said that taking the subway was so much cheaper than taking a taxi. &quot;I won&#39;t take a taxi anymore. I&#39;ll take the subway from now on,&quot; my mother said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/PwLFZSK0QQPfaNPb6iyu10WhveY0jy4sUqGYM6xm.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height= &quot;683&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/PwLFZSK0QQPfaNPb6iyu10WhveY0jy4sUqGYM6xm.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254370&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The earliest subway in the world was the London Metropolitan Subway in 1863, which has a history of 160 years ago. The picture shows the first phase of Lanzhou Rail Transit Line 2 in trial operation in June 2023. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;They don&#39;t know how to look up the map.&quot; He Jingtao said. He works at a travel agency in Guangzhou. In the two months since he created city subway guides on social media, He Jingtao has become half a &quot;traffic help blogger.&quot; He estimated that in the past two months, he had replied to more than 700 people in the comment area alone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many of the people who come to him for help come from other places to study or travel in Guangzhou. They don’t know that they can check the subway lines on the map because they don’t need to use mobile phone navigation in the local area. Therefore, the question he is asked the most is how to take the subway from the train station to a certain place or business district, or from one district to another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiaojun is one of them. When asking He Jingtao for help, she only sent him the name of the school, but she was confused about how to take the subway from the train station to the school: She was from Huizhou, Guangdong, and was about to go to Guangzhou to study at university, but she had no idea where to go or how to get there. go. She told He Jingtao: &quot;The school admission brochure only said that you can take Line 6 to the Botanical Garden Station, and it didn&#39;t mention the distance before that at all. I took the train to Guangzhou Railway Station, and there will be no more.&quot; Next, Xiaojun asked How to get from the train station to the subway station, how to buy subway tickets, how to take the bus, etc. During the summer vacation, He Jingtao received a lot of similar requests for help. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many tourists traveling to Guangzhou face the problem that the place name of the destination is different from the name of the subway station. If they don’t know how to read navigation and don’t ask others for help online, they won’t know that to go to the famous scenic spot Shangxiajiu, they need to take Guangzhou Metro Line 6 and get off at the “Cultural Park” station; if they want to go to Beijing Road Pedestrian Street , you need to get off at &quot;Park Qian&quot; station. Aware of this, when He Jingtao was doing the &quot;subway tutorial&quot;, he mapped the common attractions he had compiled to each line, station and exit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ticket buying process is also a challenge. Xiao Wu, a self-media blogger, is from Baotou, Inner Mongolia. Only one city in Inner Mongolia, Hohhot, has access to subway. Once when he was on a business trip to Hohhot and taking the subway, he met a mother with her child who didn&#39;t know how to operate a ticket vending machine. There was a long queue behind her. She was also very anxious. &quot;The more anxious she was, the more mistakes she made.&quot; Xiao Wu bought the ticket for her. This little incident became the inspiration for choosing the topic. Xiao Wu made a similar short video &quot;Tutorial on taking the subway&quot;, using a first-person perspective with narration to show the whole process of taking the subway. The video wasn&#39;t complicated to create, but it gained unexpected attention, with many people saying it was &quot;very helpful.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiao Wu remembers that the first time he took the subway was when he was traveling to Beijing after graduating from high school and took the Beijing Subway Line 1. When he walked into the subway station, he was at a loss. He didn&#39;t know where to buy a ticket. There were many people in the station. He was embarrassed to stand by and learn how others operated, and he was embarrassed to ask passers-by who were in a hurry. Although I had made a guide online in advance, when I came to the subway station alone, I was still &quot;afraid of making mistakes and showing my cowardice&quot;, so I finally asked the staff for help. He realized that many people were going through similar situations and &quot;found there was a huge demand for this.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/yE7gJXewJ6pBDtDtFVhPCSJhntOn8EWVnmtyrhy3.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height= &quot;683&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/yE7gJXewJ6pBDtDtFVhPCSJhntOn8EWVnmtyrhy3.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254372&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;According to the official account of the Ministry of Transport, in September 2023, a total of 55 cities in mainland China had 299 urban rail transit lines in operation, completing a passenger volume of 2.49 billion. The picture shows passengers waiting for subway trains at Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport in July 2023. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;David also mentioned the issue of buying tickets. Among the requests for help he received, many people were wondering why the subway did not buy tickets first and then get on the bus like buses, high-speed rails, and airplanes. So when should the money be paid? Someone once asked him in a private message, &quot;If I need to transfer and buy a ticket at a self-service machine, can I buy the ticket directly to the terminal?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What are the biggest difficulties for help seekers? David thought about it for a long time, and his answer was &quot;They can&#39;t think of these problems.&quot; He also felt confused: he occasionally had trouble with troublesome questions such as directions, transfers, and finding the station, but he was rarely asked about it. Most people often just reported two place names and then asked how to get there. Many people also asked in the comment area: &quot;What software did you use for the route map?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Anyone who watches the video and asks questions really has friends from dozens of cities outside the subway. They. Those who have never sat in it just don’t know anything.&quot; David said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Improving social exclusion in transportation&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On social media, there are many bloggers like David and Xiao Wu who create life tutorial content and use short videos to teach people How to go to the cinema to watch a movie, stay in a hotel, send express delivery, etc. They are called &quot;social survival&quot; bloggers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the feedback they received, the most frequently mentioned word was &quot;social fear.&quot; Xiao Wu once received a private message from a girl, saying that she went to school alone in the city and her parents were working in other places. She felt a little anxious and depressed, and wanted to go to the hospital, but she had never been to a hospital alone, didn&#39;t know the process, and didn&#39;t dare to tell others, so she had to ask Xiao Wu for help. Later, Xiao Wu shot a video specifically for this purpose, &quot;How to See a Doctor in the Hospital for the First Time.&quot; Another girl said she suffered from severe depression and that her memory began to blur due to electroconvulsive therapy. Because she was afraid of being embarrassed in public, she began to be afraid to go out and stayed at home for two months. After watching Xiao Wu&#39;s video, she said: &quot;I think you not only warmed me, but also many friends who came out of the countryside for the first time and didn&#39;t know the various procedures.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let Xiao Wu The feedback that impressed me the most was &quot;Do you need to teach me about this?&quot; He was once troubled by this. After the video was posted, many people questioned him and said he was &quot;simplifying traffic&quot;: &quot;Why don&#39;t you teach me how to eat for the first time and how to eat for the first time?&quot; One drink of water?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Everyone thinks that young people should know a lot, but they don&#39;t know everything. Today&#39;s lifestyle is too complicated.&quot; Xiaojiang said. Her content is positioned as &quot;Guidelines for College Students&quot;, teaching newly independent college students various social survival skills. The most popular ones are tutorial videos on taking the subway, high-speed rail, and airplanes, which have hundreds of thousands of likes. Before going to college, Xiaojiang had never used taxi-hailing apps. Her parents would help her call a taxi. Her parents often asked her to go out to buy meat, but she couldn&#39;t tell the difference between various types of meat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Most college entrance examination candidates can only worry about studying.” David once received a private message from a mother saying that her child would fly from Tianjin to Chongqing to take the art exam and asked if he could help. Arranging transportation, because the situation was complicated, David added her WeChat for step-by-step guidance. The other party asked a lot of questions, ranging from whether I could catch up with the exam in the afternoon after landing in the morning, how much transportation time I had to reserve to rush to another city after the exam, and whether I could take paints and drawing boards with me on the plane or subway. She also asked a friend in Chongqing to take care of the entire transportation of her child. &quot;She arranged the whole process. Faced with such a complicated matter, I think this mother is quite methodical.&quot; David said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;She was very happy after she actually entered the pits, and I was also very happy.&quot; Ronaldinho said. Ronaldinho&#39;s mother likes to hear the &quot;beep&quot; sound when swiping the subway code when entering and exiting the station. She was very interested in everything in the subway. After leaving the station, her mother wanted to eat the grilled fish advertised on the subway. When she took the subway again in Chongqing, she was curious why the advertisement in the carriage changed to milk tea. As soon as she got out of the station, she wanted to eat. Ask Ronaldinho to take her to drink the milk tea in the subway advertisement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The whole trip turned into a subway trip. Once, because Ronaldinho had an appointment with a friend and needed to get off the subway in advance, he asked his mother, &quot;Can you take the subway back alone?&quot; Her mother calmly said no, &quot;no problem.&quot; During that journey, her mother took pictures of her every once in a while: &quot;Look, I still remember it.&quot; Later, Ronaldinho asked her if she got home smoothly. Her mother said that she had arrived home, and when she left the station, &quot;I really couldn&#39;t find it.&quot; She asked She asked the subway staff, who enthusiastically pointed her to the exit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Completing the task of leaving the station alone gave her mother a great confidence. She said: &quot;It turns out that taking the subway is so easy.&quot; After returning home, she showed off to her father that she took the subway today and wanted to go there in the future. When going shopping on Chunxi Road in Chengdu, her father does not need to drive her. She can take the subway by herself. Dad said, let Ronaldinho teach him too. After learning how to ride the subway, her mother recorded all the procedures that Ronaldinho taught her on her mobile phone, and even took her colleagues with her when she went shopping. Her colleagues praised her, &quot;We can&#39;t even play with these things, but you can play so smoothly.&quot; My mother was very impressed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When returning from the trip, her mother asked Ronaldinho to teach her how to use 12306 to buy high-speed rail tickets. Ronaldinho sent her a high-speed rail instruction video. Later, my mother bought a high-speed rail ticket and went to Xi&#39;an to visit her old classmates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a tourism practitioner, He Jingtao can understand the importance of transportation issues. &quot;Tourism consists of five aspects: food, accommodation, travel, shopping, and entertainment, and transportation is one of them.&quot; But he admitted that he was surprised after his first subway riding tutorial became popular. “I didn’t know so many people needed it before I made it.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Professor Wang Shijun of Tongji University pointed out that in the context of rapid urbanization, some groups in urban transportation should receive more attention, that is, those with poor mobility in space and the inability to travel freely and conveniently. Destination groups, such as low-income groups, urban migrants, disabled people, elderly people who cannot use smartphones, etc. The lack of mobility in urban transportation not only leads to social differentiation and the formation of marginalized circles, but also affects all levels of social participation such as employment, schooling, and health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the possible consequences of this unfair situation is the social exclusion of transport disadvantaged groups. Professor Wang Shijun believes that the main factor leading to social exclusion in my country&#39;s urban transportation is that the current urban transportation is still in the stage of pursuing efficiency and maximizing traffic capacity, and less consideration is given to social equity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1965, China&#39;s first underground railway, Beijing Subway Line 1, started construction. It took more than ten years from preparation to opening. In the 20th century, only four cities in mainland China, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Guangzhou, had urban rail transit lines. Entering the 21st century, opening up to the outside world and economic development have driven a boom in subway construction, because building subways can promote the flow of population resources and optimize land allocation. There is a popular slogan among the people: &quot;When the subway rings, there is a thousand taels of gold.&quot; From 2010 to 2020, China&#39;s urban rail transit construction has been booming for ten years. During these ten years, 29 cities across the country have opened subways. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, the subway has become an indispensable part of the daily life of many urban residents in China. Rail transit operation data for September 2023 released by the Ministry of Transport shows that 55 cities in mainland China have opened urban rail transit lines, and the subway mileage ranks first in the world. The total passenger volume in 2022 will be approximately 22.42 billion. In the new round of subway construction applications that will be launched in July 2023, more than 30 cities may apply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Shijun believes that various official and private tutorials equipped with new media media are social innovation measures and are conducive to improving social exclusion in transportation, because an important aspect of transportation exclusion is the inability to obtain high-quality Transportation and travel information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this stage, the guidance services provided by the subway mainly rely on platform services and volunteers. Professor Huang Xiaoyan from the Northwest Land and Resources Research Center of Shaanxi Normal University also pointed out that the form of content, the platform on which it is released, and the target group are all important. Many transportation disadvantaged groups are limited by their own human capital and do not have access to this information. &quot;Now it may be necessary to consider both the macro and meso levels, as well as from the perspective of inclusiveness, fairness, and refined governance, in order to do this matter better.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhou Heng recently I passed the campus recruitment interview and am preparing to do an internship in the subway system at the end of the year. He felt that it was a pity that the professional internship that was supposed to be completed in his freshman and sophomore years was delayed by the epidemic and did not start until close to graduation. Therefore, he did not know much about his future job. He only roughly knew that he needed to maintain platform order, pick up and depart trains, and serve passengers. . If he passes the internship assessment, he will become an official subway station attendant. He found that many people &quot;didn&#39;t seem to understand and didn&#39;t ask&quot; at the subway station. &quot;When you go in (you should) look for the staff first. This is their job.&quot; Zhou Heng said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Uncle Chen, Zhou Heng, David, Xiao Luo, Xiao Wu, Xiao Jiang and Xiao Jun are pseudonyms)&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[什么是中国足球该有的样子？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258730]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 12:25:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;In March 2015, the &quot;Overall Plan for the Reform and Development of Chinese Football&quot; was promulgated. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;For more than eight years, Chinese football has continued to move in the direction guided by the football reform plan and achieved certain results, but there are also problems such as poor implementation and deviations. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The former senior executives of the Chinese Football Association, many former middle-level officials and football practitioners were suspected of corruption, which caused setbacks in the reform and development of Chinese football. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the 16th, the 12th Member Congress of the Chinese Football Association was held.

It is common for local administrative departments to not list football as a special reform task. Inner Mongolia’s recognition of the value of football education and culture is not high enough. There is a general situation of insufficient attention to the development of football culture and ineffective measures. The industry development goals and the expectations of fans and society cannot resonate at the same frequency, and the continued deepening of football reform is restricted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such situations also exist in many places in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;——The construction of local football associations is weak&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An official of a provincial football association believes that he hopes that the Chinese Football Association will do more to reform the local football associations. Effective support. At present, football associations at all levels are top-heavy, with smaller living spaces as they go down, and they lack hematopoietic ability. Most of the city and county-level football associations have no entity and only have a brand name, making it difficult or even impossible to carry out their work. Football has a strong urban attribute. Some city football associations are strong but provincial football associations are weak. The latter&#39;s position is awkward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Junqing said that the reform of some local football management systems is struggling. Some grassroots football associations and football organizations generally face problems such as insufficient market development resources, insufficient comprehensive coordination, unstable income sources, and lack of professional talents; many grassroots football associations and football organizations generally face problems such as insufficient market development resources, insufficient comprehensive coordination, unstable income sources, and lack of professional talents. The Football Association has not formed a fixed model in terms of its own construction, work operations, and guarantee mechanisms, and is generally less enthusiastic and proactive; grassroots football development is mostly initiated by passionate football enthusiasts; administrative department support is weak; as a social organization, the Football Association is recognized The degree is generally low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;——The development of the professional league has encountered a bottleneck&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An investor in a professional club said that if the league does not develop well, the national team is Rootless water; at present, clubs generally lack blood-forming ability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, many clubs still have serious problems with wage arrears and historical debts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Pei, a professor at the School of Sports Science at South China Normal University, said that many football clubs have become platforms for the exchange of public resources (mainly land). When public resources cannot be obtained through clubs, some parent companies decisively get rid of this burden. This is also the main reason why dozens of football clubs have disbanded or withdrawn in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Affected by &quot;Jinyuan Football&quot; and the transfer market has been dominated by several brokerage companies and individuals for a long time, player prices have been artificially high for a long time. The various systems for football agents, including registration, are not perfect enough, which to a certain extent contributes to the &quot;false fire&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;——The utility of youth football still exists&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Junqing believes that young players are “prematurely specialized” and training goals Problems such as &quot;one-dimensionality&quot;, &quot;adultization&quot; of training and management models, and emphasis on competition and neglect of techniques and tactics still exist; &quot;championshipism&quot; still dominates youth competitions, leading to the contradiction between &quot;leaders want results and organizations want talents.&quot; There are occurrences; the integration of sports and education is insufficient, and the connection between campus football and professional youth training systems is not smooth; most clubs do not have a complete youth training echelon, and there are gaps in football talent training; there is a large gap in grassroots football talent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Allen Renard, director of youth training at Allen Football Academy, talked about three issues: First, the phenomenon of youth training clubs poaching from each other is rampant, and some even poach people across the country, which damages the players’ enlightenment. Club Benefits. Second, most of the competitions organized by football associations at all levels are tournament-based, and there is a lack of high-quality competitions. Third, there are few venues suitable for social youth training clubs, the procedures for building new venues are cumbersome, and the operating costs are high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An investor in a professional club said that the youth calendar is confusing and repetitive, disrupting children’s training, learning, and life rhythms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the youth training compensation mechanism and joint mechanism compensation are not implemented well, which damages the interests of youth training institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Pei said that going to college is the ultimate goal of many football teenagers. They achieve this goal by obtaining a grade certificate, but their football careers often end after obtaining the certificate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deng Shijun, a physical education teacher at Wansongyuan Road Primary School in Wuhan City, said that there is a youth league at the national level, but the grassroots competition system still needs to be improved; children who play football cannot keep up with their cultural studies, and children who study have no time. To play football, it is urgent to improve the talent training system; due to the lack of a coaching training system, although many students from normal sports departments participate in campus football promotion after graduation, they do not have the qualifications of football coaches, and their knowledge structure cannot meet the needs of campus football development; due to the lack of fixed In competitions, referees generally lack a training platform and have low standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/ec24a71b0a92685fcda5da59eaf1f969.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/ec24a71b0a92685fcda5da59eaf1f969.png&quot; data-key=&quot;254227&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;This is July 10, 2022, in the first China Youth Football League (Zhejiang Division) Boys’ Primary School U11 Group Competition , Yang Haoyuan (second from right), a young player from Hangzhou Pujia Primary School, and Zhao Yirui (first from right), a young player from Zhejiang Ostrich Football Club, fight for the ball.

They often only recognize the honor value brought by it in international competitions and lack sufficient understanding of its overall value. There is insufficient understanding of the long-term, systematic and arduous nature of football, resulting in some short-sighted behaviors. Competitive performance is actually the objective result of football developing to a certain stage. Through the educational function of football, people&#39;s all-round development can be improved. Young people&#39;s participation in football should not be for the purpose of assessing grades and gaining points for higher education, but to enjoy fun and achieve the purpose of cultivating people through happy education. Only with correct values ​​can we build correct rule systems and other systems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;——The Chinese Football Association has established a good system&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jia Leishi, executive member of the Guangxi Football Association, said that the Chinese Football Association should clarify its own Our positioning is to provide good football services and do basic work, such as improving the league, youth training, coaching, refereeing and other systems. For example, he said that although there are now Chinese Super League, Chinese League One, Chinese League Two, Chinese Champions League and other leagues, the provincial, city and county league system is not perfect. Football powers have as many as a dozen or even dozens of leagues, which form the basis for sustainable development. ; At the same time, the Chinese Football Association should be more down-to-earth, establish a working system with the Football Associations at all levels, and have good business connections; the Football Association&#39;s departmental settings should be scientific; decentralize power and better play the role of the executive committee and member associations; Football Association affairs at all levels It should be transparent and open. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/7580afae56cc4e3400db8366b860feec.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/7580afae56cc4e3400db8366b860feec.png&quot; data-key=&quot;254226&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;On July 7, Tianjin Jinmen Tigers fans cheered for the team.

On the one hand, the &quot;double pyramid&quot; system gives cities, clubs, investors, and players interested in the development of professional football an upward path; on the other hand, amateur leagues with independent &quot;pyramid&quot; systems pass competition rules, team review, etc. Prevent too many professional, semi-professional players and professional club-related teams from sinking into the amateur league, prevent too many teams from investing huge sums in order to be promoted to the Chinese Champions League, and avoid affecting the enthusiasm of ordinary football fans to participate in the amateur league. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;——Improving the construction of national teams at all levels&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Professionals said that the selection mechanism of team members should be improved to select players to serve the country Excellent players with strong aspirations, first-class will and quality, good ability and style, and reasonable age structure will enter the national team; build the national team talent pool and strengthen the scientific selection; unify the technical and tactical play styles of the national teams at all levels; establish a training monitoring and evaluation system to achieve National team members at all levels train in clubs and conduct daily monitoring and evaluation of competition data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;——Increase high-quality youth competitions&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deng Shijun said that the construction of grassroots competition systems such as city and district levels should be strengthened. For example, the &quot;Wan Chao League&quot; in Jianghan District, Wuhan City runs throughout the school year and has become a platform for the growth of young players. Through school district integration, Wansongyuan Road Primary School will share its space and teachers with other primary schools in the district. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He also suggested exploring a training model in which students from physical education departments in normal colleges and universities obtain coaching qualifications (grassroots, D, C and even B levels) during college, which will partially solve the problem of campus football teachers; vigorously train students referee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reynard suggested that football associations at all levels introduce a third-party event operation system, encourage regional youth events to be graded and held continuously throughout the year, and provide venue policies and financial support for social forces to participate in youth training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of youth training compensation, professionals suggest that when conditions are ripe, a third-party account can be set up and relevant rules can be established. Transfers can only be made after completing the corresponding training compensation and joint mechanism compensation, so as to improve youth training. Institutional enthusiasm. At this stage, supervision is being strengthened and clubs that default on youth training compensation payments will be punished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;——Improve the mechanism for the integration of sports and education&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the integration of sports and education, Li Pei suggested: First, clarify the sports and education department responsibilities and rights. The education department is responsible for popularizing youth football in the compulsory education stage, and the sports department is responsible for further improving competitive levels. The second is to establish a supervision and evaluation mechanism. The education department needs to improve the evaluation indicator system for various campus football projects, strengthen the construction of internal supervision and evaluation mechanisms, strengthen the audit and performance evaluation of special funds, allocate resources based on the evaluation results, and supervise and rectify or disqualify units that fail the evaluation. The Chinese Football Association has the power to assess the levels of referees, coaches and players. It must not only strengthen internal supervision and evaluation, but also introduce a third-party supervision and evaluation mechanism. The sports department should establish a database of youth coaches, referees and team members, conduct supervision and evaluation based on competition performance, and serve as the basis for talent selection and promotion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;——Anti-corruption should be institutionalized&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the corruption phenomenon in Chinese football, Zhou Ming, a partner at Beijing Weiheng Law Firm, said , the decision-making mechanism of the Chinese Football Association must be more transparent, and at the same time introduce an external supervision and restriction mechanism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Zhenghang, a lawyer at Jingsh Law Firm, suggested strengthening the prevention mechanism before the incident and the rapid rectification mechanism after the incident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said that it is recommended that each club establish an internal supervision system. From a legal perspective, it is an anti-fraud mechanism in corporate compliance construction. Fraud here mainly refers to counterfeit gambling matters. The system construction includes the club&#39;s internal reporting mechanism, internal review mechanism and post-verification handling and reporting mechanism. It is also recommended that the Chinese Football Association establish a match-fixing supervision and inspection mechanism to conduct independent investigations and accountability for incidents that may be suspected of match-fixing discovered during complaints and reports or through arbitration committees, disciplinary committee hearings, penalties, etc., and to cooperate with the internal supervision of the above-mentioned clubs. The system is connected, and suspected crimes are directly transferred to the relevant investigation departments for further processing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people in the legal profession said that the Chinese Football Association should establish a normalized cooperation mechanism with the Ministry of Public Security. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The chairman of the Football Association of a southern province said that football reform should be carried out unswervingly and in accordance with the overall direction, requirements and path proposed by the football reform plan. If it can be solidly advanced and all departments can coordinate well, how can we What if I can’t do it well? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 12:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[成都2岁女童遭恶犬咬伤]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258847]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 11:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;A 2-year-old girl in Chongzhou, Chengdu was attacked by a vicious dog.

Even on weekdays, there are nearly a thousand merchants in this four-story trade city, with &quot;tens of thousands of people coming in and out every day.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As for the fallen elevator, although it is strictly classified as a freight elevator, it usually contains &quot;a mix of people, goods, and tricycles.&quot; Wang Ning said that the elevators are usually very crowded. &quot;It is always crowded during the holidays, which poses a huge safety risk.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Passengers and cargo are mixed, and the elderly often ride on them&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At around 11:50 a.m. on the 18th, Liang Ping (who came to Maitreya for business) (pseudonym) was eating on the fourth floor of Fucheng Shangdu when he suddenly heard a loud noise and &quot;everyone gathered around him.&quot; He told Southern Weekend reporters that at the time he was mentally wondering if something had happened to the elevator. Later, &quot;when I went over and asked, I found that something had indeed happened and he had fallen to the first floor.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;About 20 minutes later, the ambulance arrived at Fucheng Shangdu. Liang Ping saw two elderly people being carried out. &quot;An aunt from a minority ethnic group, probably about seventy years old, was unconscious. Later, another one was carried out, also wearing minority clothes and a hat. The same headgear.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liang Ping said that he has been to the commercial capital of Fucheng three times. According to his observation, the freight elevator where the accident occurred was more than ten square meters. You can drive in.&quot; The elevator contains a mix of passengers and goods. &quot;Local people usually take it because the passenger elevator cannot be used.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He introduced that the first floor of the mall is a vegetable market, selling vegetables, meat, and fruits; the second floor sells seasonings, spices, and dry goods; the third floor sells clothes; and the fourth floor sells clothes. It&#39;s the highest level, and it&#39;s also a vegetable market. It sells a variety of things, &quot;just like a farmer&#39;s market.&quot; Many interviewees reported that it is mainly local people who come here to buy food, and most of them are elderly people who take the elevator to go upstairs. &quot;It&#39;s quite difficult for (elderly people) to go up to the fourth floor. They usually take the elevator, and very few people climb the stairs directly,&quot; Liang Ping said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another local, Li Cheng (pseudonym), described to Southern Weekend reporters that there are large cargo elevators that can carry tricycles in the south and north of the mall. The elevator that caused the accident was located in the mall. North Gate. In addition, there are two escalators in the mall. In addition to the vendors who sell vegetables, there are also residents buying vegetables who take the freight elevator. In addition, there are full-time personnel in the freight elevator to manage the floor buttons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The official website of Maitreya Jisheng Commercial Management Co., Ltd. shows that the predecessor of the Fucheng Shangdu Commercial Complex was the Maitreya Laohongfeng Farmers’ Market. The complex is located in the farmer’s market. It was upgraded and renovated on the original site; it has a total construction area of ​​64,000 square meters, a total of more than 800 shops, and more than 600 fixed and scattered stalls. The farmer&#39;s market where the incident occurred is located in the first phase of Fucheng Commercial City. The four floors are connected by stairs and escalators. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liang Ping recalled that before the elevator accident, he went to the toilet on the third floor and heard a Didi alarm sound near the stairs. According to his analysis, the stairs were only a few meters away from the freight elevator where the accident occurred. &quot;I don&#39;t know if the alarm sound is related to the elevator.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The brands involved were subject to administrative penalties in many places&lt;/h2>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Cheng remembered that he went to Fucheng before When shopping in shopping malls, you can see the mall maintaining elevators every few days. He said that for safety reasons, he would not take the freight elevator, but would only take the escalator. In Wang Ning&#39;s impression, the elevator that had the accident usually had some minor problems. Sometimes when he went to sell goods, he saw that the elevator was not open. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At about 21:00 on the 18th, a Southern Weekend reporter called the contact number of the staff of the Fucheng Shangdu Monitoring Room. The other party confirmed that the elevator manufacturer in the market was Shanghai Aiden. Attenborough Elevator Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Attenborough Elevator), but the model of the elevator that caused the accident is unknown. The staff member said, &quot;The elevator has been in use since the Fucheng Commercial Capital was built.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Public information shows that the first phase of the Fucheng Commercial Capital opened in 2015 , the property operator is Maitreya Jisheng Commercial Management Co., Ltd. After the accident, Southern Weekend reporters called the relevant persons in charge of the company and its parent company, Yunnan Jicheng Holdings Co., Ltd., but they all hung up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporters called Attenborough Elevator, Attenborough&#39;s Yunnan branch and Kunming branch, but no one answered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Attenborough Elevator has many records of poor maintenance. According to the data, in 2018, the Kunming Quality Supervision Bureau received a complaint that an elevator trapped a person in the No. 3 elevator of Building 5, Rongcheng Kunming Lake Community, Longjiang West Road, Kunming City. Attenborough Elevator was the elevator maintenance unit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Qichacha shows that in recent years, Attenborough Elevator has been banned from Chengdu, Putian, Anqing, Market regulatory authorities in Jinan and other places imposed penalties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Attenborough Elevator’s most recent administrative penalty was recorded in March 2023. A random inspection by the Chengdu Shuangliu District Market Supervision Bureau found that in the paper maintenance records of elevators in a certain community, the first and last maintenance times for Attenborough brand elevators were May 2022 and September 2022 respectively. Its staff said that later maintenance records were registered through the mobile APP, but the APP showed that the elevator only had one maintenance record in January 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In January 2023, Kunming Chenggong District Market Supervision Bureau also punished Attenborough for &quot;failure to perform elevator maintenance in accordance with safety technical specifications.&quot; The Yunnan branch of the elevator was fined 10,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The &quot;Special Equipment Safety Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; stipulates that as a special equipment that poses a greater risk to personal and property safety, the operating unit of the elevator must You should be responsible for the safe use of equipment and set up a safety management organization or assign full-time safety management personnel. When operators discover potential accidents or other unsafe factors, they should immediately report to the safety management personnel and the relevant person in charge of the unit; when special equipment is not operating normally, operators should follow operating procedures and take effective measures to ensure safety. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to the &quot;Elevator Maintenance Rules&quot;, the maintenance unit should formulate emergency measures and rescue plans, and conduct emergency response at least once every six months for different types of elevators in the unit drill. If any accident hazards are discovered during the maintenance process, the elevator user must be notified promptly. If serious accident hazards are discovered, they must be reported to the local special equipment safety supervision department in a timely manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[新来的领导要“立威”？当以能力与公道服人]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258690]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;How to establish prestige when you have just been promoted to a leader? One netizen said that this can be divided into three situations. First, the most ideal situation: your appointment is a typical internal promotion. Everyone thinks you are the best candidate to be the leader of the department, so it doesn’t matter whether you establish prestige or not. At this time, you only need to do what a leader should do and let everyone recognize your management methods and abilities. Second, a more difficult situation: because you have been transferred from another department, the employees in your department are still relatively unfamiliar with you. In this situation, you should not first think about how to establish prestige. Instead, you should act as a new member of the department and adopt the concept of learning to adapt to and learn from the situation of this department. Once you have figured it out, you can then think about the next step. matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most difficult situation is the third situation: your appointment has aroused opposition from many people in the department, and many people feel that you are not worthy of being the leader. At this time, if you don’t have strong abilities, it’s better not to think about the self-defeating tactics of Zhaoliwei. You should focus on maintaining the situation first, and then look for opportunities to find ways to break through the resistance that affects you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above classification is still very reasonable, and my experience can also confirm it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Years ago, when I took the position of director of an important department at my former employer and became the leader of many old colleagues, I also thought about this issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I first came to this unit, I was still a trainee. Most of my colleagues who later became &quot;subordinates&quot; of my department are already senior employees. After I was made a full-time employee early and was promoted early, I felt tremendous pressure. I was afraid that my colleagues in the department would not listen to me, which would cause great embarrassment. As a person who has worked in the military camp for twelve years and &quot;managed people&quot;, I understand that the environment I am in is different. I don&#39;t think I have the temperament of a &quot;tyrannical CEO&quot; at all, so I choose the most clumsy and dull kind. For example, I lead everyone to work together, occasionally share tasks for colleagues and then give them &quot;work points&quot;, and I also create things in my spare time. On the condition that they are invited to eat and play, and they try their best to help colleagues in need. Strive to win favor with a &quot;passionate leadership&quot; attitude. This approach is very different from that of &quot;smart people&quot; who are good at playing tricks and talking around. I used to think that what I did was a sign of lack of &quot;leadership&quot;, but now that I think about it, what I did was actually not bad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I doubt whether a leader like me belongs to the &quot;minority&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Needless to say, there is an unknown dream of &quot;tree power&quot; hidden deep in our souls. Wang Xifeng in the Grand View Garden also wanted to establish his authority and used various tricks for this purpose. For many people, the hardest thing to resist is the urge to show off their status in front of others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As I get older, I can better understand the frivolousness of being eager to declare authority when I &quot;reached the top&quot; of the department when I was young. Over the years, I have seen several young cadres who have just been promoted being &quot;verbally bribed&quot; by frequently calling them &quot;director so-and-so&quot; and &quot;general so-and-so&quot;, with visible pride on their faces. There are countless workplace dramas in which, in the eagerness to establish prestige and eliminate &quot;thornheads&quot;, they get into a big fight with their subordinates and find it difficult to deal with the situation. The shortcomings are still due to the lack of knowledge in the heart, and they actually act willfully regardless of their actual situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Considering the circumstances mentioned by the respondent, if everyone is convinced by you, is there any need to show your authority? If everyone is &quot;not cold&quot; towards you, is there any point in showing off your prestige? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What&#39;s more, what some people call &quot;establishing authority&quot; is to use power to suppress others and use &quot;authority&quot; to the extreme. Otherwise, they will feel that their rights do not expire and become invalid. In the workplace, this disease is not as common as Other areas are lighter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A good friend of mine said it well, letting someone be a leader means letting you take the lead in doing things, not letting you deal with others. However, some people who hold leadership positions with dishonorable reputations or unworthy morals care about their &quot;tails&quot; being discovered and stepped on by their subordinates. Therefore, they either play the trick of killing chickens to scare monkeys, or they show off their power. In the attitude of &quot;You have to be afraid of me&quot; and &quot;It&#39;s better to kneel down and lick me&quot;. This is not to establish authority, it is simply to establish enemies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, if some people insist on &quot;controlling others&quot; in the workplace, they will often hit a wall. Even if I can&#39;t survive your actions, isn&#39;t it okay to change departments and leave? How many people&#39;s resentment and disdain are hidden in the narrative here between the iron-clad &quot;workplace&quot; and the smooth &quot;beating workers&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, it is not a bad thing for a person to have prestige, or to want to establish prestige. However, it is open to speculation as to where a person&#39;s prestige should come from - whether it comes from power and the means designed to display power, or from character and ability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, no matter what circumstances you become a leader, whether you are inside or outside the system, you cannot do without this question: Is your judgment better than that of your subordinates? , whether what you do is more beautiful than what your subordinates do. In the final analysis, as a leader, whether you have authority or not is determined by your professional ability and character. When you are well-equipped with both political integrity and talent, and do things well, even if you are an &quot;airborne soldier&quot; or a rising star, you will still be respected by your subordinates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Specifically, when faced with hesitation, it is inevitable to make decisions with leadership authority and let subordinates follow the arrangements. However, in a normal context, leaders must not only be good at forming consensus with subordinates, but also be good at forming consensus with subordinates. Have the awareness and courage to advance and retreat together, and must defend the legitimate rights and interests of subordinates at all times. As an old friend said, a leader cannot protect his subordinates from wind and rain. What do you want the leader to do? Is it just a decoration? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than ten years ago, when my &quot;power&quot; was at its greatest, the department consisted of three or four departments, with dozens of employees, and the management situation was quite complicated. I don’t know if I have built up any prestige during my years as a department leader, but after I left my job, I overheard praise from my old colleagues: I dared to take on tasks for my subordinates. In addition, some colleagues also said to me, &quot;You have resigned, so why are we still here?&quot; and they finally left after me. I am often inexplicably moved by these sincere words and true nature, and feel that I am worth it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In reality, it is not uncommon for leaders to have great ambitions but little talent, and for laymen to lead experts, and such leaders are particularly indifferent to the rights and feelings of their subordinates. They either give credit to themselves and pass the blame to their subordinates, squeeze and intimidate them in various ways, and simply treat their subordinates like fools, or they are alienated from their subordinates, suspicious of each other, and have no integrity. For this kind of leader, even if no one dares to say &quot;no&quot; to his face, he will inevitably be scolded behind his back. It should be noted that no one in this world is a fool. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, a leader should look like a leader: have good judgment and strong ability to act, be able to make decisions, take responsibility, and have a simple and strong character. Even if such a leader&#39;s ability needs to be strengthened, he can still improve his overall performance and gain the understanding and support of his subordinates. Can a leader who is magnanimous and fair in his actions have a bad reputation? I have lived over fifty years and have never seen an example to the contrary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[五年间，千亿债务“削峰”：地方化债的镇江样本]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258822]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/NTydygQiWy1Aa7n58WpDWSaGYxFYkXRNWBLwCKW4.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1800&quot; height=&quot;1201&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/NTydygQiWy1Aa7n58WpDWSaGYxFY kXRNWBLwCKW4. png&quot; data-key=&quot;254417&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the past few decades, Zhenjiang’s economy has mainly relied on heavy industries such as chemicals. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This year, the feeling is very obvious. Mainstream financial institutions have begun to do business in Zhenjiang.” A financial leasing company An employee told Southern Weekend reporters that due to risk control reasons, the company had not done business in Zhenjiang for several years, but this year it allowed it to do so. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2013, the scale of Zhenjiang’s debt has continued to rise, and it was even once called the “four major Internet celebrities” in the market’s urban investment debt issues, together with Zunyi, Xiangtan, and Dalian. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Enterprise Early Warning Data, if the debt ratio is calculated as (government debt + urban investment platform interest-bearing debt)/GDP, Zhenjiang’s debt ratio has increased from 105% in 2018 to 121% in 2020 . In the past three years, its debt ratio has been higher than that of the other 12 prefecture-level cities in Jiangsu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The high debt ratio has increased financial pressure in Zhenjiang, and financial institutions have also been deterred, and most have chosen to reduce their business volume in Zhenjiang. However, in 2023, Zhenjiang’s local debt situation showed obvious signs of improvement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An obvious signal is that two urban investment companies in Zhenjiang have just received AAA entity ratings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 13, 2023, the official website of the Jiangsu Provincial State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission issued a document stating that Zhenjiang Industrial Investment Holding Group Co., Ltd. and Zhenjiang Urban Investment Holding Group Co., Ltd. have both obtained AAA subject credit ratings, realizing the credit construction of Zhenjiang City. A historic breakthrough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, the highest credit rating of Zhenjiang’s urban investment companies was AA+. Among the 13 prefecture-level cities in Jiangsu Province, Lianyungang, Suqian and Zhenjiang have no urban investment companies with AAA credit ratings. Obtaining an AAA rating means that the financing difficulty of the urban investment platform is reduced and the cost is reduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“After the debt situation eased this year, our bank reopened the credit line to a city investment platform in Zhenjiang.” A person who works at a city commercial bank in Jiangsu revealed to Southern Weekend reporters that the city investment company had previously Risk point: His bank had suspended credit to the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, among the 13 prefecture-level cities in Jiangsu Province, Zhenjiang’s GDP ranked fourth from the bottom. Although it is located in southern Jiangsu, its economy is far away from Wuxi, Changzhou and Suzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How did Zhenjiang, a relatively weak economy, resolve hundreds of billions of debts? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“There are more difficulties than expected, and the challenges are greater than expected”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Zhenjiang is located at the intersection of the Yangtze River and the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, guarding the north-south hub, and is connected with Nanjing, Changzhou, Taizhou and Yangzhou border on each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Jiangsu Statistical Yearbook and the seventh national census data, Zhenjiang covers the smallest area among the 13 prefecture-level cities. Among the population distribution across Jiangsu Province, only Zhenjiang has a permanent population of less than 4 million. In other words, Zhenjiang has the least land and the least people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1983, Zhenjiang became a provincial municipality. In the past few decades, Zhenjiang&#39;s economy has mainly relied on heavy industries such as chemicals. According to the Zhenjiang Municipal Economic and Social Development Bulletin, from 2013 to 2017, the total output value of Zhenjiang heavy industry accounted for more than 80% of the total output value of designated industries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2016, in order to protect the ecological environment, Jiangsu Province began to deploy special actions to reduce backward chemical production capacity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the official website of the Zhenjiang Municipal Government, in 2017, the city shut down a total of 53 chemical companies, exceeding the provincial target (6 companies). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“For backward and excess production capacity, we must resolutely eliminate those that should be eliminated.” In January 2019, Bu Xiaofang, then director of the Zhenjiang Municipal Economic and Information Technology Commission, introduced that in 2018, the city shut down 44 chemical companies, a total of 44 chemical companies were shut down in the past two years. Nearly half of chemical companies have been shut down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under environmental protection regulations, Zhenjiang’s economy has entered a period of pain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, its annual fixed asset investment fell by 26.5% compared with the previous year, and private investment fell by 30.4%. In terms of industries, investment in the secondary industry dropped by 28.9%, of which industrial investment dropped by 27.9%; investment in the tertiary industry dropped by 24.3%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also this year, Zhenjiang’s GDP growth rate was 3%, ranking last among the 13 prefecture-level cities. Its GDP growth rate was 9.3% in 2016 and 7.24% in 2017. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 2019 Government Work Report introduced that in the past year, the three indicators of Zhenjiang’s GDP, total retail sales of consumer goods, and fixed asset investment have failed to meet the goals set by the People’s Congress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The then mayor of Zhenjiang City, Zhang Yefei, said in his government work report, &quot;Looking back on 2018, there were more difficulties and greater challenges than expected.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people in northern Jiangsu In cities, chemical industry is also an important industry, so why does it have less impact on economic growth than Zhenjiang? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An economist in Zhenjiang told Southern Weekend reporters that unlike the northern Jiangsu region, the Yangtze River flows through Zhenjiang. In the past, many chemical companies were located in areas closer to the Yangtze River. In the past few years, the Yangtze River Under the Great Protection Strategy, environmental protection management has become more stringent, and many chemical companies have had to close down or move away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The upgrading of industrial structure requires a buffer period.” The scholar analyzed that compared with other cities in southern Jiangsu, Zhenjiang’s high-tech enterprises and advanced manufacturing enterprises are small in scale and lack core leading enterprises, which will lead to local The capacity for economic development is limited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, after the new leadership team of the Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government took office, Zhenjiang’s development philosophy also changed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Zhenjiang will never repeat extensive growth in pursuit of speed, never engage in ‘numbers games’ in pursuit of political achievements, will never borrow blindly for image projects, and will never sacrifice the ecological environment in pursuit of economic interests. .&quot; In January 2019, Zhang Yefei, then mayor of Zhenjiang City, said in an interview. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While the chemical industry was shut down and reorganized, a large amount of debt burdened by the vigorous development of urban construction in previous years was still accumulating, which put pressure on Zhenjiang&#39;s finances of low revenue and high debt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2017, the Zhenjiang Municipal Government’s work report stated, “In the past five years, the urban area has completed a total of 290 billion yuan in urban construction investment.” In comparison, Zhenjiang’s general public budget revenue in 2017 was 28.4 billion yuan. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During this period, urban investment debt also increased rapidly. According to the Enterprise Alert, from 2013 to 2017, the interest-bearing debt of Zhenjiang Urban Investment Platform increased from 122.1 billion yuan to 350.3 billion yuan, an increase of 187%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee inspection team inspected the Zhenjiang Municipal Party Committee and found that during a certain period, &quot;the municipal Party committee did not do enough research on debt control, economic layout, major projects, and urban construction.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Zhenjiang Municipal Party Committee wrote in the inspection and rectification report that in view of the inadequate management of government investment projects, it was made clear that all government investment projects must be managed by the municipal party committee and municipal government through unified decision-making, and a series of documents were issued to build a System system for completion acceptance. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Municipal finance has completely returned to &#39;food finance&#39;&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Economic growth has slowed down, a large amount of money has been invested in urban construction, and there is rigid payment pressure on the finance. Zhenjiang&#39;s local debt problem has gradually exposed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2018, Zhenjiang City’s budget implementation in the first half of the year revealed that the scale of municipal fiscal maintenance and operation expenditures has increased year by year. In 2018, municipal department budget arrangements for personnel, operations and business project expenditures were close to 3.4 billion yuan. &quot;Under the development trend of large total operating expenditure, high proportion, and rapid growth, municipal finance has completely returned to &#39;food finance&#39;.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Food finance&quot; refers to the fiscal revenue of the first-level government, which is only enough to maintain the salaries of personnel in government agencies and institutions, as well as basic daily operations. In 2018, Zhenjiang City’s general public budget revenue was 12.6 billion yuan. 3.4 billion yuan, equivalent to 27% of the general public budget revenue that year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhenjiang’s 2018 budget execution report stated that incremental financial resources are limited, and the balance of fiscal revenue and expenditure in recent years has mainly relied on revitalizing existing stocks, coordinating funds, and replacing financial resources. However, there is less and less room to absorb incremental expenditure through existing financial resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China Discipline Inspection and Supervision News reported that on January 18, 2019, Lou Qinjian, then Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, pointed out that “Zhenjiang City has weak links in supervision of key areas, and the government’s hidden debt risks are prominent. , and there are even corruption issues.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Slowly, Zhenjiang’s debt situation became known to the outside world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Zhenjiang, debts are mainly concentrated in various urban investment platforms, and government debt is still controlled under the limit. If you look at the debt scale of Zhenjiang Urban Investment alone, it is much lower than that of Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou and other places, and is not outstanding in Jiangsu Province. The key issue is the debt ratio. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhenjiang’s debt ratio is much higher than that of other cities in Jiangsu. According to the aforementioned calculation method, in 2013, its debt ratio was only 41.71%, and in 2020 it reached 121%. If the debt ratio is too high, it means that the local comprehensive financial resources are difficult to repay debts, and cannot even guarantee the existence of debts, which is prone to risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the urban investment debts in Guizhou, Yunnan and other places are concentrated at the county level. But in Zhenjiang, urban investment debts are mainly concentrated in municipal platforms. The enterprise warning notice shows that in 2022, the interest-bearing debt of Zhenjiang&#39;s top four municipal urban investment platforms will be 207.5 billion yuan, and the interest-bearing debt of all urban investment platforms in Zhenjiang will be 340.5 billion yuan, accounting for 61%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This situation is also related to Zhenjiang’s economic structure. Zhenjiang has jurisdiction over 3 districts and 3 county-level cities. The economic aggregate of county-level cities is higher than that of municipal districts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“In the past few years, Zhenjiang City has not been as prosperous as the counties (county-level cities) below. Mainstream financial institutions would rather do business in the counties (county-level cities) than invest in the cities. Platform operation.&quot; Wang Li, who works for a financial leasing company in Shanghai, and whose major customers are mainly urban investment companies across Jiangsu, explained to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to alleviate financing pressure, Zhenjiang Urban Investment Platform began to issue a large number of non-standard products. Compared with bank loans and bonds, non-standard financing issuance costs are higher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhenjiang Cultural Tourism Industry Group (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Zhenjiang Cultural Tourism&quot;) is 100% owned by the Zhenjiang Municipal State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission and is a municipal urban investment platform. Zhenjiang Cultural Tourism&#39;s bond prospectus shows that in 2017, its non-standard financing scale was only 2.8 billion yuan, and by 2020, it had climbed to 11.8 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past ten years, Zhang Huan has spent tens of millions of yuan purchasing non-standard products from urban investment companies in various places. He told Southern Weekend reporters that around 2016, he purchased non-standard products in Zhenjiang, and the interest rate was less than 7%. However, at that time, the income from urban investment bonds in Guizhou, Yunnan and other places was higher, and non-standard products in Zhenjiang were not easy to sell. &quot; In order to persuade me to buy, the agent would give me some rebates, such as buying 1 million and getting 10,000 back.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An employee of a financing intermediary company told Southern Weekend reporters that the highest coupon rate for non-standard products in Zhenjiang was around 9%. The employee said that at first Zhenjiang’s district and county urban investment platforms were issuing such products, probably because of the difficulty in financing, but later they were concentrated on municipal platforms with larger assets. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Support from provincial governments&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Zhenjiang Municipal Government began to solve the urban investment debt problem before the risk occurred. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of 2019, news leaked out of the market that the China Development Bank would replace Zhenjiang’s implicit debt at a cost of 20 billion yuan a year for 2 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of that year, Zheng Zhijie, the former president of the China Development Bank, said at a forum, &quot;Zhenjiang has problems with high repayment pressure and high costs. Zhenjiang also wants to extend the term and reduce the current financial burden. I also We participated in the talks, but the Zhenjiang News plan was not approved by the Ministry of Finance.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2019, when talking about how to resolve the existing debt, Finance Minister Liu Kun stated that he would insist that the central government would not bail out. Who is responsible for borrowing money, so that &quot;whose family&#39;s children will be cared for&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the CDB’s plan was not passed, Jiangsu Province began to increase its debt support for Zhenjiang. The specific methods were to increase the scale of special bonds, reduce the financing pressure of urban investment platforms, and avoid relying on high-interest non-standard product. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Special bonds of municipal and county governments are issued by provincial governments on their behalf. After counting the budget implementation status of various regions in Jiangsu, it can be found that the scale of special debt in Zhenjiang in 2019 increased by 34.6 billion yuan compared with the previous year. Among the 13 prefecture-level cities in Jiangsu, Zhenjiang is the place with the largest increase in the scale of special debt. In 2020, the scale of Zhenjiang&#39;s special bonds increased by 42.5 billion year-on-year, also exceeding other regions in the province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the large-scale issuance of special bonds, the scale of Zhenjiang government debt has changed accordingly. According to data such as Zhenjiang City&#39;s budget implementation, Zhenjiang City&#39;s government debt scale was 109.7 billion yuan in 2019, which is not outstanding in the province. In 2021, the debt will rise to 191.8 billion yuan, second only to Nanjing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, Zhenjiang also replaced high-cost hidden debts by issuing replacement bonds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 2019 financial accounts of Danyang City and Dantu District under the jurisdiction of Zhenjiang, the replacement of hidden debts was mentioned. According to the final accounts report of Danyang City, the government bonds issued by Jiangsu Province in 2019 totaled 5.3 billion yuan, of which 1.4 billion yuan were replacement bonds, accounting for 26%. The replacement bonds were used to repay the existing implicit government debt of platform companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dantu District also revealed in its final accounting report that it issued 679 million yuan of existing replacement bonds to repay existing hidden debts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“In response to financial and debt risks, we have taken measures such as curbing growth, adjusting structure, and reducing costs. The total amount of government debt and costs have ‘double decreased’.” Zhenjiang Municipal Government’s 2021 Work Report wrote. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Enterprise Early Warning Data, Zhenjiang’s urban investment interest-bearing debt increased by 200 million yuan year-on-year in 2021, with little change; in 2022, urban investment’s interest-bearing debt was 340.5 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 9.7 billion Yuan. In other words, the debt scale of Zhenjiang’s urban investment platforms has been controlled and is trending down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many urban investment practitioners in Jiangsu told Southern Weekend reporters that the most critical factor in Zhenjiang’s debt-oriented development is the financial and policy support from Jiangsu Province. For a long time, Jiangsu&#39;s GDP has ranked second in the country and has strong economic strength. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The official website of the Lianyungang government shows that on May 27, 2022, the north-south paired assistance meeting between Wuxi and Lianyungang was officially held. For more than 20 years, Lianyungang has been supported by Zhenjiang. For Zhenjiang, withdrawing from assistance can alleviate some of the financial pressure. In addition, changing Lianyungang&#39;s sponsor from Zhenjiang to Wuxi also requires coordination from provincial government departments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Zhenjiang also has professional cadres handling debt matters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2020, Zhou Kai, then vice president of Bank of Jiangsu, was transferred to deputy mayor of Zhenjiang City. Previously, he worked at China Construction Bank Jiangsu Branch, Bank of Nanjing and Bank of Jiangsu for more than 20 years. According to the official website of the Zhenjiang Municipal Government, Zhou Kai is in charge of the local financial regulatory bureau, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, municipal state-owned enterprises, etc., and assists in being in charge of the Finance Bureau. The deputy mayor must also be nominated by the Organization Department of the Provincial Party Committee. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Reduce financing costs&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2021, Jiangsu Province issued the &quot;Guiding Opinions on Regulating the Investment and Financing Behavior of Financing Platform Companies&quot;, requiring guidance for financing platform companies to gradually reduce trust and capital costs. management plans, financial leasing, private equity funds and various non-standard products issued on local trading venues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to replacing hidden debt with bonds, Zhenjiang also received assistance from banks to increase credit and reduce financing costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhenjiang Communications Industry Group (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 混体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as &quot;Zhenjiang Communications Investment&quot;&lt;/span>;) wrote in the bond prospectus , with the coordination and support of government resources, since 2020, the total amount of corporate bank credit has increased, high-interest non-standard financing has been cleared to a greater extent, the debt composition and financing costs have been better improved, and financing costs have decreased by 0.84% ​​compared with 2019. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After analyzing bond prospectuses, Southern Weekend reporters found that between 2020 and 2023, the top four urban investment platforms in Zhenjiang in terms of asset size have all seen sharp declines in non-standard financing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, the one with the largest scale reduction is Zhenjiang Communications Investment. In March 2020, the amount of non-standard financing in Zhenjiang was 15.3 billion yuan, accounting for 25.86% of the total financing scale; in March 2023, the amount of non-standard financing was 5.555 billion yuan, accounting for 10% of the total financing scale. Compared with three years ago, it dropped by 9.745 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Lin works at a municipal urban investment platform in Zhenjiang. He told Southern Weekend reporters that the company had cleared away other high-cost non-standard products, except for short-term emergency financing, which could only be done after filing. According to the person from the above-mentioned financing intermediary company, there are currently no non-standard products for the public in Zhenjiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2023, many places in Jiangsu have announced the upper limit of financing interest rates for urban investment. Several people from Zhenjiang&#39;s urban investment platform told Southern Weekend reporters that the upper limit of Zhenjiang&#39;s external financing costs is 6.7%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, this interest rate is at a medium level in Jiangsu Province. A staff member of an urban investment platform in Nanjing told Southern Weekend reporters that the local urban investment financing limit is 4.2% (five-year LPR), which is almost the strictest regulation in Jiangsu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to people from the above-mentioned financing intermediary companies, some urban investment platforms in Jiangsu can issue fixed financing products with interest rates of up to 7%-8%. &quot;Actually, the upper limit of issuance cost is 6.699%.&quot; Zhang Lin said that if the red line of 6.7% cannot be reached, &quot;lower cost financing must be achieved.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2022, the Zhenjiang Municipal State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission issued a document stating that for high-cost financing projects that meet or exceed the financing cost control price determined by the municipal government, the &quot;High-cost Debt Management Approval Form&quot; must be filled out one by one in advance 》, after the enterprise implements the internal decision-making procedures, it can be carried out after being reviewed by the Municipal State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, reported to the leaders of the municipal government for approval, and reported to the Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision for filing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned Nanjing Urban Investment person also revealed that if the cost of a financing reaches 5%, the district will advise you not to do it. If there is real financial pressure, the district will coordinate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Zhenjiang City State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission’s document also mentioned that it is necessary to clarify the mutual insurance quotas of enterprises based on the financing needs and affordability of relevant enterprises, implement total amount control, and prevent cross-conduction of debt risks and unlimited extension of debt chains. In principle No guarantee shall be provided in excess of the mutual insurance limit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years, the mutual guarantee situation among Zhenjiang municipal-level urban investment companies has not been optimistic, with Zhenjiang Cultural Tourism being the most serious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Its bond prospectus shows that as of the end of March 2020, the issuer’s external guarantee balance totaled 16.7 billion yuan, accounting for 97.93% of net assets. The company provides relatively large amounts of external guarantees, mainly to state-owned enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Recovering economic losses of nearly 1.6 billion yuan”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the basis of specifying the upper limit of financing costs, Zhenjiang and other places in Jiangsu are further reducing financing intermediary fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2019, the Zhenjiang Municipal Party Committee wrote in a report on the progress of inspections and rectifications that it is necessary to further standardize the decision-making and operating procedures of financing projects, strictly control intermediary agency service fees, formulate intermediary agency service management methods, and adopt intermediary Institutional access system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Incorporate the intermediate business expenses in the credit link into the total cost and determine them together, require all municipal industrial groups to register their accounts in detail, and eliminate the payment of financing and financial advisory fees to third-party non-financial institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Some urban investment platforms are controlled by intermediaries, and there is no way around them.” Li Yu has worked in many financial leasing companies. He told Southern Weekend reporters that intermediaries generally have a close relationship with the leaders of urban investment companies. Internet, &quot;Even if the cost is low, urban investment will not do business with you, you must go through an intermediary.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yu said that after the intermediary participates, it will push up the financing cost. For example, if 6% of the cost can be financed, the final cost will be 8%, and the middle 2% will be between the intermediary, urban investment, and investors. divided into. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An article published on the website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Supervisory Commission stated that since the launch of a special rectification of corruption issues in the financing field in January 2022, the Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision of Zhenjiang City, Jiangsu Province has filed a total of 22 cases and investigated party members and cadres, including those at the county level. With 3 cadres, nearly 1.6 billion yuan in economic losses were recovered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the special rectification, the Zhenjiang Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision comprehensively reviewed the financing business of platform companies at the municipal, county and township levels in the past ten years, focusing on and verifying financing projects whose comprehensive financing costs significantly exceeded the market interest rate. , sorting out financing projects with major doubts such as illegal payment of intermediary fees and abnormal comprehensive financing costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, it was discovered that a number of fund &quot;brokers&quot; were involved in cross-regional financing business and obtained high intermediary fees, as well as bribing platform company officials. A total of 10 fund &quot;brokers&quot; were investigated and punished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yu revealed that this year, government staff from a certain place in Jiangsu came to a financial leasing company where he previously worked and demanded the return of funds that were higher than the upper limit of financing costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, urban investment platforms across Jiangsu are very sensitive to financing costs. In October, at a financing negotiation meeting of a certain urban investment company in Jiangsu, Southern Weekend reporters saw an executive repeatedly negotiating with bank staff, hoping that the other party could reduce the channel fee of 3‰. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Now when the person in charge of an urban investment company goes to the government for a meeting, the first thing he reports is not the current status of the company’s operations, but the situation of debt repayment.” A Zhenjiang urban investment practitioner said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Wang Li’s view, Zhenjiang Urban Investment’s debt has not been significantly compressed, but the internal debt structure has been well adjusted, non-standard financing has accounted for a low proportion, and the debt can survive stably. “What financial institutions value most is Or debt stability.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Li’s company has conducted statistics and found that the number of new financial leases in Jiangsu in 2022 dropped by 40% year-on-year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years, governments at all levels in Zhenjiang have also revitalized state-owned assets to relieve financial pressure. In 2018, Zhenjiang City&#39;s state-owned capital operating income was only 568 million yuan, and it reached 4.854 billion yuan in 2020, mainly coming from property rights transfer income at the municipal level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the number of high-quality state-owned assets is limited and this income is difficult to sustain. In 2022, state-owned capital operating income will drop to 585 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years, with the help of the provincial government and financial institutions, Zhenjiang has improved its debt structure by curbing the increase in debt and replacing high-interest debt. Coupled with the recovery of financing intermediary fees and the establishment of financing cost ceilings and other control measures, the debt ratio has been steadily reduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2023, the Zhenjiang Municipal Government’s work report revealed that in 2022, in response to financial debt risks, the government will strengthen the concept of “debt reduction is also political achievement” and further promote “redundancy reduction” and “peak reduction”. Four plans, annual goals and tasks were fully achieved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beginning in 2019, the Ministry of Finance established a local government debt risk rating mechanism, dividing debt risks into red (debt rate ≥ 300%), orange (200% ≤ debt rate &lt; 300%), yellow There are four levels: (120% ≤ debt ratio &lt; 200%) and green (debt ratio &lt; 120%). &quot;Going off the red&quot; refers to the debt risk level that leaves the red. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 16, 2023, in response to issues related to Zhenjiang’s chemical debt, Southern Weekend reporters called the Zhenjiang Municipal Finance Bureau, but the other party declined the interview request. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(At the request of the interviewees, Wang Li, Zhang Lin and Li Yu are pseudonyms in the article.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; /p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[张之洞为何再三邀请他北上？陶福祥与张之洞的“岭学流传中原”计划]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258692]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/16/uAHKaAKt8pPKk3GxEarg8QaVt3xFpc5kh1mEol60.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;759&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/uAHKaAKt8pPKk3GxEarg8QaVt3xFpc5kh 1mEol60. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254130&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Portrait of Tao Fuxiang. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Taken from &quot;Portraits of Scholars in the Qing Dynasty&quot;/pictures)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early days of Zhang Zhidong&#39;s supervision of Hubei, he proposed that &quot;Lingxue spread to the Central Plains&quot; He said that in order to attract scholars from Guangdong Xuehaitang to go north, he particularly valued Tao Fuxiang (alias Chunhai), a disciple of Lingnan scholar Chen Li. Ruan Yuan, governor of Guangdong, founded Xuehaitang. After the mid-Qing Dynasty, the status of &quot;Lingxue&quot; rose rapidly. Xuehaitang does not have a mountain director, but elects many scholars as &quot;seniors&quot;. Zhang Weiping, Tan Ying, Zhu Ciqi, Chen Li, Zou Boqi, etc. have all served as seniors. In the seventh year of Guangxu&#39;s reign (1881), Zhang Shusheng, the governor of Guangdong and Guangxi, petitioned the court to &quot;compliment and commend&quot; two great Lingnan scholars, Zhu Ciqi and Chen Li, and both of them were awarded the title of &quot;Fifth Rank Minister&quot;. When Zhang Zhidong was in charge of Guangdong, he founded Guangya Academy. One of his purposes was to inherit the academics of Xuehaitang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xuehaitang attaches great importance to &quot;simple learning&quot;, and Chen Li, a native of Panyu, inherited and developed Ruan Yuan&#39;s academic tradition. Scholars during the Qianjia period focused on textual research, while the official ideology promoted Zhu Xi, forming an opposition between Sinology (textual research) and Song Dynasty (righteousness). Chen Li followed the current situation and put forward the slogan of &quot;reconciling the Han and Song Dynasties&quot;, and the &quot;reconciliation theory&quot; was gradually affirmed by the mainstream. Zhang Zhidong&#39;s &quot;Encouraging Learning&quot; written in 1898 emphasized that &quot;old learning is the body and new learning is the application&quot;, which is also a &quot;reconciliation theory&quot; and is in the same vein as Chen Li in terms of thinking and methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Li&#39;s &quot;Study Notes of Dongshu&quot; was once popular all over the world. Wen Tingshi quoted Weng Tonghe as saying that Emperor Guangxu &quot;placed this book on his desk and read it daily.&quot; Yuan Chang, a disciple of Zhang Zhidong, expressed his admiration for Chen Li many times in his diary. In the seventh year of Guangxu&#39;s reign, Yuan Chang &quot;read Mr. Chen&#39;s &quot;East School Reading Notes&quot; and found out that everything he said was profound, practical and feasible, and now Mr. Hu is stable.&quot; Mr. Anding Hu was Hu Yuan, a famous scholar in the Song Dynasty. In the fourteenth year of Guangxu (1888), Yuan Chang called Chen Li and Zeng Guofan together, &quot;the only recent sages can be called Zeng Wenzheng and Chen Panyu.&quot; He called Chen Li &quot;Chen Panyu&quot; without a name, and was compared with Zeng Guofan and highly praised. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before this, Zhang Zhidong had met Tan Zongjun, the son of Tan Ying, and Gui Wencan, a disciple of Chen Li. In 1871, Pan Zuyin and Zhang Zhidong launched an elegant gathering at Nagarshu Temple in the capital. Gui Wencan and Tan Zongjun were both guests. Zhang Zhidong wrote to Pan Zuyin, saying that Gui Wencan&#39;s attainments in Confucian classics were &quot;really unattainable.&quot; Chen Li was highly praised by important officials in the court, and Gui Wencan played an irreplaceable role. In the fourth year of Guangxu&#39;s reign, on Chen Li&#39;s 70th birthday, Zhang Zhidong wrote a couplet to congratulate him on his birthday. The couplet said: &quot;Living late and taking care of the elderly will make the world admire your virtue; sharp thinking and thinking are the teachings of scholars.&quot; Although he had never met Chen Li, he I highly admire Chen Li&#39;s academic practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the winter of the 15th year of Guangxu&#39;s reign, Zhang Zhidong moved from Guangdong and Guangxi to Huguang, and planned to build Lianghu Academy based on the model of Guangya Academy. The following year, Zheng Zhitong (also known as Bo Geng), who was appointed to teach economics at Lianghu Academy, died suddenly, which made him turn his attention to Lingnan scholars. Zheng Zhitong (1831-1890), a native of Zunyi, Guizhou, was the son of the famous scholar Zheng Zhen. In his early years, he served as an assistant to Zhang Zhidong in Sichuan academic affairs, and was later hired as the branch of Guangya Bookstore. In Zhang Zhidong&#39;s mind, the best candidate to succeed Zheng Zhitong was Tao Fuxiang, Chen Li&#39;s disciple and Liang Dingfen&#39;s teacher. From this, Zhang Zhidong launched his &quot;relentless pursuit&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Third Collection of Stele Biographies·Biography of Tao Fuxiang&quot; says: &quot;Wen Xiang moved to Lianghu to supervise Lianghu and set up Lianghu Academy. Yue Yue thanks the sick and returns home.&quot; The wording is simple. The process of Zhang Zhidong insisting on asking Tao Fuxiang and Tao to resign repeatedly, taking care of Zhang&#39;s face to go north for a short period of time, and then resolutely returning to Guangzhou can be seen in the telegrams exchanged between Wang Bingen and Tao Fuxiang this year, which are now in the Institute of Modern History of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. They can be attributed to Tao Fuxiang. Add footnotes to the biography. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Bingen, courtesy name Xuecen, was born in Huayang, Sichuan. Zhang Zhidong was a protégé of Zhang Zhidong when he was an academic and political scholar in Sichuan. He had been an official in Guangdong for a long time and was promoted by Guangya Bookstore at that time. On the third day of February in the 16th year of Guangxu, Zhang Zhidong sent a telegram to Wang Bingen: &quot;Since Bo Geng (Zheng Zhitong) is gone, there is no one to teach economics in Lianghu Academy, except Tao Chunhai, who is filial, honest, elegant, upright and pure. He is qualified to occupy this seat and look forward to future generations.&quot; Invite me to Hubei for a total of 800 gold to repair the fire. The situation of dividing the religion here is different from that of Guangya. There is no need to invite another mountain leader. He has more power and a more respectable appearance. The appointment will be sent as soon as it is accepted.&quot; (&quot;Modern History Collection of the Qing Dynasty&quot;) &quot;Copy of the Nominee&#39;s Manuscript&quot;, Volume 2, Volume 41, Page 26, the following quotations are only registration numbers and page numbers) Confucian classics were the core of the culture of the day. Lianghu Academy does not have a mountain director. After teaching by division, he has the status of subject leader and has greater power. Zhang Zhidong was afraid that Tao Fuxiang would care about his reputation, so he explained it this way. &quot;Yuan Ya Duan Chun&quot; is not only an evaluation of Tao Fuxiang, but also Zhang Zhidong&#39;s criterion for hiring Confucian classics teachers. At that time, there was a saying that &quot;a Confucian teacher is a teacher of people&quot;. Confucian teachers should not only have profound knowledge, but also have noble conduct and be able to teach all living beings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tao Fuxiang (1834-1896), courtesy name Chunhai, also known as Ailu, was born in Panyu, Guangdong. He studied under Chen Li when he was young. Thousands of volumes. Zhang Zhidong supervised Guangdong and was appointed as the headmaster of Guangya Bookstore. In the spring semester of the 17th year of Guangxu&#39;s reign (1891) at Lianghu Academy, apart from classics, there was also a shortage of history teachers. Zhang Zhidong asked another student of Chen Li, Lin Guogeng. Lin Guogeng, courtesy name Yang Bo, was born in Suishi Township, Panyu County. He could write poems at the age of nine and entered Haitang as a college graduate. He and his younger brother Lin Guozan both made outstanding achievements in history. Chen Li called the two brothers &quot;Erlin, the treasure of the country&quot; also&quot;. Lin Guogeng was elected as the senior student of Xuehaitang in the eleventh year of Guangxu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tao Fuxiang did not want to go north, so he said goodbye in the telegram: &quot;Fuxiang regards the museum as his home. It has now been opened. The scattered disciples have moved in and it is difficult to prepare it for the time being. There are funerals in summer and autumn, so it is not convenient to travel far.&quot; (Volume 66, page 711) The school he opened has opened and the students cannot be dismissed. Moreover, there are funerals at home in the summer and autumn, so it is difficult to accept the invitation from Hubei. Ten days later, Zhang Zhidong Power Generation Wang Bingen analyzed the reasons for Tao Fuxiang&#39;s resignation. In addition to opening a bookstore and teaching apprentices, he also served as the headmaster of Guangya Bookstore, the senior of Xuehaitang, and the head of Jupo Jingshe. He had a high status and a good income. . Zhang Zhidong replied to Wang Bingen and promised to find a way to do this. He said hello to Li Hanzhang, the current governor of Guangdong and Guangxi, and reserved three part-time jobs for him. &quot;Even if the two seniors, Jupo and Xuehai, come to Hubei Province, they can still hold concurrent positions. Tao is the leader of Guangdong middle school scholars. These two places must not belong to others. When I take a seat in the bookstore, I should entrust Li Xiaoshuai (Li Hanzhang, also known as Xiaoquan) ) As usual, I sincerely agree to come, and the appointment letter will be sent on the same day.&quot; (Volume 41, page 391) In Zhang Zhidong&#39;s mind, after Chen Li died, Tao Fuxiang became the &quot;leader of Guangdong middle school scholars&quot;. In order to please Tao Fuxiang, he did not hesitate to I begged Li Hanzhang, the successor governor of Guangdong and Guangxi, to reserve a part-time job for Tao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to impress Tao Fuxiang and Lin Guogeng, Zhang Zhidong sent a telegram to Wang Bingen: &quot;Tao and Lin are not lonely when they come to Hubei. They both hope to be invited to come. From then on, Ling Xue It is said that in the Central Plains, Tao and Lin will also be happy if they think about it.&quot; (Volume 41, page 398)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Zhidong hired Tao Fuxiang with such a low profile that he only had to visit the thatched cottage three times in person, which made Tao feel Sorry, I had no choice but to come up with a compromise, which was to teach in Hubei for three months and then return to Guangzhou on the grounds of &quot;burial&quot;. Tao Fuxiang spent three months in Wuchang to determine the scale and curriculum of the Confucian classics teaching at Lianghu Academy, and then returned to Guangzhou. Before leaving, Zhang Zhidong asked Tao Fuxiang for a &quot;substitute&quot;. Tao Fuxiang recommended Wang Guorui, a fellow sect member from Panyu, but Wang seemed to have failed to make the trip in the end. When Lin Guogeng first received the invitation, he declined on the grounds of his father&#39;s old illness (Volume 66, page 714). He was eventually persuaded to teach history at Lianghu Academy. In 1892, he passed the Jinshi examination and was awarded the title of editor of the Hanlin Academy. He left Hubei. . Liang Dingfen, a disciple of Chen Li, once served as the supervisor of the Lianghu Academy and was Zhang Zhidong&#39;s main assistant in handling academic affairs in Hubei. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xuehaitang attaches great importance to practical learning. One of the seniors, Zou Boqi (from Nanhai), has profound research on optics and surveying. He once presided over the surveying and mapping of Nanhai County maps, which was the beginning of the modern method of surveying and mapping local chronicles and maps in my country. Luo Zhaocang, a disciple of Zou Boqi and a native of Nanhai, specialized in surveying and mapping. He was recruited by Zhang Zhidong to survey and map rivers in Hubei, and stayed at Lianghu Academy to teach. After that, Zhang Zhidong hired many Guangdong scholars to go north, including Confucian classics teacher Yang Yufang (Nanhai), Confucian classics teacher Ma Zhenyu (Shunde), and arithmetic teacher Tang Jinzhu (Huaxian). Tang Jinzhu majored in actuarial science and was hired by Zuo Zongtang to teach at the Fujian Shipbuilding School. Xuehaitang inherited the orthodox classics and history of the Qing Dynasty, and had many disciples who were also good at practical studies (surveying, mapping, arithmetic, etc.). This was the main factor why they were favored by Zhang Zhidong. In 1905, Zhang Zhidong and Yuan Shikai suspended the imperial examination, and academics entered a new era.

Run towards the venue and light the main torch. The hyper-realistic virtual digital human Lili made his film and television debut in the TV series &quot;Under the Stranger&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the digital people on the screen, more digital people &quot;join&quot; companies and work with humans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The concepts of virtual people, digital people, and virtual digital people are often used interchangeably on the market, and the industry has not yet formed a unified understanding. Generally speaking, virtual people refer more to purely digital images without real-person entities in reality, while digital people include virtual images without real-person entities, as well as digital &quot;doppelgangers&quot; of real people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Digital humans have anthropomorphic or human-like appearance, behavior or thinking ability, but have no physical entities and only exist in virtual space. Because of its characteristics of freely customizing appearance, absolute obedience to orders, and tirelessness, it carries the perfect imagination of human beings to overcome the limitations of the mortal body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, in addition to Digital Human technology companies and film and television animation companies, those engaged in the production of digital humans, domestic and foreign Internet giants, when laying out the metaverse, have without exception chosen digital humans and launched their own digital products. Human creation platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As digital human suppliers flourish, who is paying the bill for digital humans? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;From ten thousand yuan to one million yuan&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Common digital people can be divided into cartoon images, two-dimensional characters, realistic or hyper-realistic figures in appearance. People; in terms of driving methods, they can be mainly divided into real-person driven and AI-driven; in terms of functional positioning, they can be divided into performing arts digital people and service-oriented digital people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different types of digital people will also have large differences in technical routes and production costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The accuracy of the digital human model is mainly determined by the number of faces.” Shen Jianyou told Southern Weekend reporters. He was born in 1995 and works as a marketing manager at Guangzhou Virtual Power, a company that provides inertial motion capture technology and virtual digital human production services. Most of the company&#39;s employees are born in the 1990s. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shen Jianyou explained that modeling a cube only requires six faces, but the model usually involves complex curved surfaces, and more faces are needed to ensure the smoothness of the model. Ordinary cartoon dolls have a small number of modeling faces and do not involve the production of complex clothing, hair, etc. The closer to real-life hyper-realistic models are, the more complicated the production is. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The complexity of the model is related to the real-time driving effect. Shen Jianyou gave an example. The facial expression of a cartoon model is mainly the opening and closing of the eyes and mouth, while the facial expressions of a humanoid model usually have 52 sets of model deformation parameters. In other words, the subsequent workload and production costs are determined from the moment the customized image is determined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A set of digital humans that can be driven in real time costs at least tens of thousands of yuan, including digital human image customization, motion capture equipment and virtual anchor systems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shen Jianyou said that due to the different usage scenarios of customized digital humans, the specific cost must be determined based on customer needs. The cost of producing a hyper-realistic digital human like Liu Yexi&#39;s is in the millions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liang Zikang, CEO of Chuangyi Technology, which produced Liu Yexi, once told the media that in the first half year of launching Liu Yexi, the cost investment in R&amp;D, manpower and technology was about one million levels, and the cost of the first Liu Yexi short video Up to hundreds of thousands of dollars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporter consulted Alibaba Cloud sales as a customer and learned that through Alibaba’s digital star-making service, it costs about 50 RMB to design a set of virtual digital human assets that are adapted to real-person intelligent driving and multiplexed in multiple scenarios and ports. Ten thousand yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the cost of customizing digital humans is not low, most of the customers Shen Jianyou comes into contact with in the market are still B-side, especially in the fields of cultural tourism, education, and government exhibition halls. Occasionally, there are those with higher budgets. C-side customers are coming. &quot;For example, some anchors who don&#39;t want to show up or want to maximize their own advantages.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, many personal virtual anchors at Station B use Live2D models (two-dimensional animation effects), also known as the anchor&#39;s &quot; leather case&quot;. To make a &quot;leather case&quot;, you need to complete the character drawing and then make it into a Live2D model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some painters will provide some exquisite public vertical paintings. For exclusive characters, you need to make an appointment with the painter, and the price ranges from a hundred yuan to a thousand yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A company that provides Live2D model production has launched a regular model production package priced at 666 yuan, and the most expensive package does not exceed a thousand yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After having the model, you can complete the motion capture of the face and hands with the help of the camera. The live anchor can operate the model in the live broadcast screen through facial expressions and hand movements in front of the computer to achieve preset expressions. and simple actions, but the model cannot move freely. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A virtual anchor at Station B said that if the anchor himself has the ability to take over the work of painters and modelers, the cost of live broadcast is only the hardware investment. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The birth of digital actors&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Among digital actors, digital artists with exquisite production and versatile talents are the most eye-catching and the most expensive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Their image and appearance fully cater to the market aesthetics, and they have a distinctive personality and identity label since their debut. For example, Luo Tianyi and A-SOUL who are good at singing and dancing, Liu Yexi, a blogger who is good at makeup and catching monsters, AYAYI and Ling_Ling, KOL bloggers who specialize in fashion, and Tianyu, a digital figure in the ancient style track. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Digital artists who gain attention by relying on their &quot;face&quot; and &quot;personality&quot; mean that they have to continue to invest in high production costs and stable operating capabilities. The lack of either will make digital artists become a lackluster actor on the Internet. An &quot;empty shell&quot; that no one cares about. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, the way digital artists monetize is no different from traditional artists, mainly through brand activities, business endorsements, performances, etc. Compared with the two, digital artists have fewer exposure opportunities, a weak fan base, and limited visibility and market appeal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in recent years, there have been numerous cases of real-person celebrities’ “collapse” affecting brand image, and many brands have begun to cooperate with digital artists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Angie, born in 2020, is a virtual idol under the Dongtu Universe. She is a girl next door with short neck-length hair and clean makeup. The works on the Douyin account tend to record daily life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three years after its debut, Axi has established cooperative relationships with brands such as Zhong Xuegao, Yadi Changhua, Chery, Xiaomi, OPPO, and Qiandu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhong Xuegao, the brand manager, replied to Southern Weekend reporters that cooperation with digital person Axi is a new exploration and attempt to achieve brand innovation, shorten the distance with young consumers, and enhance the interaction between consumers and enterprises. feel. The advantage of digital human endorsement is that it can adapt to the characteristics of the brand for secondary creation and customize the image and content in line with the brand&#39;s tone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lili, the first hyper-realistic digital human under Alibaba Entertainment Group, has successfully participated in film and television dramas and has become a veritable &quot;digital actor&quot;. In the play, Lili plays the role of Erzhuang, a girl who has no limbs and can only walk and control electromagnetic waves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The head of the Lili team gave a written reply to the Southern Weekend reporter. Initially, there were eight versions of Lili’s image. Finally, the current version was selected based on user research. It is sweet and cute but also a little cool. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scene that reflects Lili&#39;s &quot;acting skills&quot; is Erzhuang&#39;s fantasy of being greedy when he hears food from others. Alibaba said that this was due to the director&#39;s &quot;training&quot;, and the best effect was tested in Lili&#39;s extreme expressions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the shooting plan of director Xu Hongyu, the role of Er Zhuang was originally completed with traditional special effects, and was later replaced by a digital human plan. The head of Lili&#39;s technical team said that compared with traditional special effects, the digital human solution can reduce production costs by 80%, mainly saving the cost of original painting settings and IP asset creation; AI technology has shortened the post-production cycle by 40%, and the crew More choices and possibilities in less time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Yong, CTO of Alibaba Entertainment Group, revealed to the media that after the broadcast of &quot;Under the Stranger&quot;, Lili&#39;s performance in the drama attracted several directors to inquire about digital human technology solutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Science fiction film director Qiao Fei also paid attention to Lili&#39;s performance in the TV series, but he believed that from the perspective of the big screen presentation effect, the film narrative has extremely high requirements on the actors&#39; tiny expressions and movements, and subtle performances are hidden. It contains a wealth of information, but the level of delicacy of digital human performance is far from ideal. &quot;What real people can do easily, it costs a lot to hand it over to AIGC.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Qiao Fei&#39;s view, digital human actors only provide a technical alternative similar to traditional special effects production. Unless digital people can accumulate IP value, they will have the same brand spillover benefits as celebrity artists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/vLH9Sds1AvaEOKfHLMtuWaQ9l1SmOVUwru5A42vh.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height= &quot;848&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/vLH9Sds1AvaEOKfHLMtuWaQ9l1SmOVUwru5A42vh.png&quot; data-key=&quot;254376&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;After a real person wears facial capture and motion capture equipment, it can drive the digital human image to make the same movements in real time. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Maiquan/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Surge in demand for virtual live broadcasts&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Digital human production companies receive more demand from brand digital human image customization or digital human IP in a certain project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Seyou Technology, founded in 2014, is the technology provider of digital humans for the Hangzhou Asian Games. After obtaining the image of the digital human from the Asian Games, Shiyou Technology&#39;s goal is to make the digital human move, and use AR technology to complete the visual image output of the digital human running and igniting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Chong came to Shiyou Technology in 2016 as the head of marketing. In the early days, her customers mainly came from the field of radio and television, customizing real-time interactive virtual hosts. In 2018, the increased requirements for visual teaching materials in the education field brought a large demand. After 2019, the epidemic forced various industries to move online, and brand virtualization Demand for live streaming has surged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When a brand’s investment ratio tilts towards online, in order to better achieve brand exposure, companies often customize a set of digital human images. Shiyou Technology has provided customized services for brand image digital people and IP-based virtual digital employees for companies such as JD.com, Tmall, Haier Brothers, and Suning.com. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 19, 2023, Jinpai officially announced its first digital employee-Dongfang Jin, who also serves as the company&#39;s brand ambassador. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dongfang Jin, who made his debut, was wearing a red Tang suit, black suit pants and black leather shoes. He was holding a paper fan and had a tall and tall figure. This digital human model is technically supported by Guangzhou Fantuo Digital Innovation. Fantuo Shuchuang is a company specializing in digital exhibition hall design. Fantuo Digital&#39;s 2022 financial report shows that the digital human project is its new business, accounting for only 2% of total revenue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Liu Lilan, the person in charge of the Dongfangjin project, told Southern Weekend reporters that digital people are a way for brands to increase communication with users, such as participating in marketing activities and conducting Q&amp;A interactions with consumers in the holographic warehouse of corporate exhibition halls. . &quot;When visiting a company, there will still be dedicated experience specialists to receive consumers, involving a series of tasks such as accommodation, guidance, explanations, etc. This is something that digital people cannot replace.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Lilan will later be responsible for Dongfangjin&#39;s marketing For event or content operation work, Fantuoshu Creation provides technical support to partners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Within Jinpai, the Dongfangjin project is a typical project of digital transformation. &quot;The content and budget of the (Dongfangjin) project have been determined. Compared with some marketing activity projects, the budget of this project is not high.&quot; Liu Lilan said that if subsequent content operators have new needs, they will still increase the budget. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;The Sun Never Sets&quot; Live Broadcast Room&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Since 2023, you can often see this video on short video platforms: rows of workers in the office There were no real people in the seats, there was a screen on each table, and the anchor on it kept introducing the products. The person in the video reminded that the anchors on the screen are all digital people and can work for you 24 hours a day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tireless digital people hit the pain points of practitioners in the live broadcast industry. Below the video, there are multiple messages asking how to purchase such a digital anchor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;service-oriented digital humans&quot; launched by various digital human technology manufacturers are digital human images driven by AI that can be separated from real people and can serve content output fields such as news broadcasting, live broadcasting, and customer service. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You only need to provide pictures or videos, and AI will automatically simulate and reproduce a 2D digital image that is almost the same as a real person. Enter text or voice, and AI can allow the digital person to make mouth shapes and expressions that fit the content. and action. Some AI digital people can even freely convert the voices of multiple countries to achieve a perfect fit of mouth shape and smooth and natural movements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporter’s search found that leading domestic cloud vendors have also launched similar AI digital human products, such as Baidu Cloud, Tencent Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, Huawei Cloud, iFlytek, JD.com, Volcano Engine, etc. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of these platforms provide monthly subscription services. Ordinary users can use the built-in public models, voices, actions, etc. on the digital human generation platform. After entering the background, they can edit and generate short videos of the digital human just like editing text. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take the iFlytek Smart Production Platform as an example. The price of an ordinary member is 399 yuan per month. Users with high-frequency production needs can purchase an exclusive membership for 2,999 yuan per month. Tencent Intelligent Video provides non-members with a five-minute digital human broadcast experience per month. The most expensive professional membership is only 598 yuan a year, and enjoys 30 minutes of digital human video and 600 AI paintings per month. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Southern Weekend reporters consulted in the name of customers and found that due to different rules of live broadcast platforms, digital live broadcasts are still difficult to achieve across multiple platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alibaba Cloud Digital Human mainly provides digital human anchors within the Taobao ecosystem. Alibaba Cloud Sales introduced that Taobao supports digital human anchors, and the traffic allocation for real anchors and digital human anchors is treated equally. Hangzhou Qianxun and Nanjing Silicon Foundation also cooperated to launch digital human anchors to make up for the problems of limited energy and high cost of real anchors. Digital humans self-broadcast in stores late at night and during non-prime time periods, extending the live broadcast time and improving the effectiveness of the anchors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Businesses are eager to use AI anchors to create a live broadcast room where the sun never sets. In the view of some platforms, this is damaging to the live broadcast ecosystem. The pre-sales customer service of Volcano Engine stated that the digital human live broadcast service has not yet been launched, and &quot;Douyin does not allow digital human live broadcasts.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On Douyin, some bloggers also reported the risk of &quot;account ban&quot; caused by using digital live broadcasts. Some are because the platform determines that digital live broadcasts are recorded broadcasts, and some are due to the use of public models. Despite this, some digital live broadcast merchants are still instructing merchants on how to avoid triggering platform account suspension. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters anonymously consulted two Douyin users who had purchased Digital Man’s live broadcast. One user said that Digital Man’s live broadcast had zero sales in the first week, and the other pointed out that Digital Man’s live broadcast room could not attract people. Real users watch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiao Fei pointed out that the greatest value of live broadcast is that it can bring companionship to the audience. The audience can capture a lot of emotional information from the real anchor, but digital people cannot provide it, which is why digital people cannot retain the audience. reason. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But digital people still have certain advantages in batch output content. Shen Jianyou gave an example. For short video operators, they have to process a large amount of video content every day. Shooting and cutting videos takes up a lot of time and energy. Digital short videos only need to replace the text content to quickly generate video files, which improves Work efficiency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 18 Oct 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[多专家谈罗威纳犬咬伤女童：“关键在管理人，其次才是管理狗”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258846]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-18 23:06:33&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;After the vicious dog bit the girl, the dog owner was taken criminal coercive measures.

(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 16, 2023, a 2-year-old girl in Chongzhou, Chengdu, Sichuan was attacked by a black Rottweiler in the community The attack resulted in multiple bites all over the body, contusions and lacerations on the right kidney, and fractured ribs on the right side. After the incident attracted widespread attention, on the evening of October 17, the Chongzhou City Joint Investigation Team issued a situation report. At about 3 o&#39;clock on October 17, the owner of the black Rottweiler arrived at the case. The police have opened a case for investigation into the incident and taken criminal coercive measures against Tang, the owner of the black Rottweiler dog, in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporters learned that Rottweiler, as a large working dog, is often used by military and police departments for riot control and inspection. In many cities, including Mianyang, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Guangzhou, etc., it is listed as a restricted or banned breed; but in Chengdu, it does not appear in the list of 22 breeds of violent dogs that are banned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Each city has a different definition and understanding of fierce dogs. Some cities think that large dogs are fierce dogs, and some cities think that they are aggressive dogs. They are fierce dogs, so the banned breeds vary in each city.&quot; Zhang Yongbing, secretary-general of the Sichuan Pet Association, explained to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the opinion of &quot;Hai Shi&quot; (screen name), a member of the China Rottweiler Club (CKURK), in this incident, the black Rottweiler The owner should bear most or even all of the responsibility: large dogs like Rottweilers must not &lt;span>;wear&lt;/span>; a leash when walking the dog, &quot;just like a driver driving without a seat belt.&quot; In addition, Haishi also mentioned that this kind of anti-riot dog with strong strength and strong bite ability also needs scientific feeding from dog owners. &lt;/span>; “A working dog like the Rottweiler, which ranks high in obedience and intelligence, needs stability first. The first step it takes out of the house is to &lt;span>;wear&lt;/span>; it properly. Leash.&quot; Haishi emphasized that &quot;the key to raising large dog breeds in cities is to manage people, followed by dogs.&quot;&lt;span>; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Many interviewees said that incidents of fierce dogs injuring people in the city are not isolated cases. Although regulations regulating dog-raising behavior in various cities stipulate that dogs should use leashes when leaving the house and dogs must not be abandoned, the effect of law enforcement is still limited. How to regulate the uncivilized dog-keeping behavior in daily life has become a challenge for the current refined urban management. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The list of prohibited dogs varies greatly from place to place&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On July 1, 2010, the &quot;Chengdu Dog Breeding Management Regulations&quot; were officially implemented. The regulations stipulate that dog-raising households in restricted areas are limited to one dog per household; individuals are prohibited from raising aggressive dogs and large dogs; dog owners are not allowed to abuse or abandon dogs. In addition, the regulations also stipulate that when dog owners take their dogs out of the house, they should put the dogs in a dog cage, a dog bag, or be led by a person with full capacity for civil conduct using a dog leash. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As the first city in the country to enact dog-raising regulations, Chengdu has continued to use this management regulation for the next 13 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But Zhang Yongbing found that 13 years later, this document had a lot to add and improve. For example, among the banned breeds, Zhang Yongbing suggested updating the list of banned aggressive dogs based on the dog’s personality and aggression. In addition, community property management can also play a greater role in stopping uncivilized dog-raising behavior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporters checked the national laws and regulations database and found that after 2020, various places have intensively introduced dog breeding management regulations in the form of local regulations. However, not all cities have introduced similar management regulations, and different places have different approaches regarding the types of dogs that are prohibited and how to hold owners accountable for uncivilized pet-raising behavior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Judging from the number of dogs owned by residents, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Shenzhen and other cities have stipulated that each household in the management area is limited to one dog. However, Shenzhen stipulates that those who keep two or more dogs must &quot;comply with the relevant conventions of the community or residential area where they are located, and provide proof of consent from the neighborhood committee or property owners committee&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Cities such as Beijing, Hangzhou, Changsha, Wuhan, Xi&#39;an and other cities have included the Rottweiler dogs in Chongzhou that are prohibited from raising by individuals. , but in cities such as Shenzhen in Guangdong, Xiamen in Fujian and Guangyuan in Sichuan, they are not included in the list. In the list of prohibited dogs in some cities, dog breeds such as Bernese Mountain Dog, Akita Dog, Chinese Pastoral Dog, and Jugui also appear; but in other cities, the above dog breeds are not on the list of prohibited dogs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What kind of protection should be taken when taking aggressive dogs and large dogs out? Cities such as Beijing, Chongqing, Xi&#39;an, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai stipulate that dog owners need to add extra protection to their dogs. Wear a muzzle, but Chengdu has not made more detailed regulations on the need for large and violent dogs to wear muzzles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although most dog-raising regulations do not allow dog owners to abandon dogs, based on the analysis of the regulations, whether various places should pursue abandonment and how to punish them, The scales are also different:&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Guangyuan City does not stipulate the punishment for abandoned dogs; Hangzhou stipulates that abandoned, lost and confiscated dogs shall be punished by the city The dog authorities handle the matter uniformly; Chongqing, Qingdao and other cities stipulate that abandoning dogs will be punished with fines; Jinan stipulates that individuals who abuse or abandon dogs will be fined not less than 2,000 yuan but not more than 20,000 yuan, and those who indulge or drive dogs to intimidate Anyone who harms others or harms others will be punished in accordance with the relevant provisions of the &quot;Public Security Administration Punishment Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot;. Those suspected of committing crimes will also be held criminally responsible in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;May 2021, Beijing, a Rottweiler dog at the Pet Carnival event.

He believes that the current management model that distinguishes restricted areas from non-restricted areas has caused many problems. &quot;The management intensity of restricted and non-restricted areas in our country is very different. The problems of free-range breeding, disorderly breeding, and non-vaccination in rural areas are serious. Many (dog) vicious injuries occur in rural areas; breeding households have serious problems with dogs. It&#39;s just improper management&lt;span>;,&lt;/span>; or even malicious abandonment.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the other hand, domestic breeding is still stuck in the &quot;treating pets as economic &quot;animal&quot; stage and are bred and raised extensively. “For dogs, three to fourteen weeks is generally a critical period for their socialization, but most breeders do not have the ability and awareness to help puppies for sale establish good behavioral habits so that they can adapt to living with people in the future. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chen Jie, director of the Shanghai Gongyi Law Firm, analyzed to Southern Weekend reporters that the treatment of the dog owner Tang was not based on the relevant dog owner. Instead, Tang was held legally responsible based on the crime of negligence causing serious injury in the criminal law. &quot;As the manager of dogs in the city and also the handler of injury cases, the public security department has the right to decide whether to intervene in such cases.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Zhang Yongbing believes that due to the limited manpower of law enforcement agencies, the current urban dog management regulations are not like a preventive measure. Relevant departments often only intervene after problems occur. In actual operation, it is still difficult to have some mandatory measures to deal with the uncivilized dog-raising behavior of citizens, and it is easy for loopholes in supervision to occur. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The intensity, difficulty and cost of law enforcement are all too high.&quot; Chen Jie believes that the current dog-raising regulations in various places impose penalties for uncivilized dog-raising behavior. It is not too serious, which means that this is an act that requires citizens to be conscious and self-disciplined. &quot;A person who can raise a dog shows that he has certain financial ability and cultural accomplishment, and can also abide by the rules. But at present, there are still many aspects that deserve vigilance and attention.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text -align: left;&quot;>;Chen Jie, Du Fan and many other &lt;span>;interviewers&lt;/span>; believe that in addition to local dog-raising regulations, there is more to regulating the dog-raising behavior of urban residents. It requires the cooperation of multiple forces in the city to establish a refined management dog breeding system. In addition to the public security department, it also requires the participation of different forces such as market supervision, property management, and dog owners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Compared with catching and beating dogs that may occur after the incident, the source of the aggressive dogs is more suspicious.&quot; Du, President of Wuhan Small Animal Protection Association Fan Xiang, a reporter from Southern Weekend, analyzed that if dog owners can continue to purchase aggressive dogs that are prohibited by city dog-raising regulations from the market, it will be difficult to prevent such tragedies from the source. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Yongbing suggested that in addition to dog owners learning the corresponding management systems before raising dogs, property companies currently restrict some behaviors of dog owners in the community. More can be done. &quot;They (property companies) should also conduct some professional training and learning, such as how to identify the type of dog, how to stop an attacking dog, and stop the uncivilized dog-raising behavior of some owners who do not listen to persuasion, etc.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;After discovering an ownerless or aggressive dog, the property company can report it to the public security organ for disposal, but they do not have the power to kill it. According to the tort liability code of the Civil Code &quot;The property management company has the obligation to ensure safety in the community. If a resident is injured by a domestic dog or a stray dog ​​in the community, the property management company, as the relevant responsible party, must also bear the liability for supplementary compensation.&quot; Chen Jie proposed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 18 Oct 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[从自由市场谈“父权”与“资本”的矛盾性]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258662]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-18 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Some people like to talk about &quot;patriarchy and capitalism&quot; and connect &quot;patriarchy&quot; and &quot;capitalism&quot; At the same time, it is actually very inaccurate. This concept is similar to the term &quot;feudal autocracy&quot; because logically speaking, since it is feudal, it is obvious that it cannot be &quot;autocratic&quot;. And &quot;autocracy&quot; cannot be feudal. Similarly, if there really is &quot;paternal authority&quot;, that is, the kind of powerful patriarch that many people imagine, who can strictly control their children, then the children will naturally not be able to freely enter big cities to work. And under the conditions of capital and free markets, it is actually very easy for a woman or man to get rid of &quot;patriarchy&quot; and enter a big city as a free atomic individual to work in a company cubicle. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Patriarchy&quot; and &quot;capital&quot; are contradictory&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In other words, it is precisely the free market, &quot;capital&quot; and modern enterprises that allow a large number of women/men to become &quot;independent workers&quot; female/male” rather than continuing to obey traditional “patriarchal” dictates. In fact, if you think about it for a moment, if you are a traditional &quot;father&quot; who cares very much about your authority over your children, and you see your children running to work in the markets of big cities and breaking away from your authority, will you applaud or applaud? Will be very angry? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, capital and market economy are exactly what dismantle &quot;patriarchy&quot;, at least for most ordinary people. In traditional &quot;patriarchal&quot; societies, people&#39;s lives are dominated by mutual assistance and division of labor in small agricultural communities, and they need to respect family authority and various authoritative customs. However, in the market economy lifestyle, all other needs besides work can be obtained through commercial purchases. A modern independent woman/man can live alone without buying food to cook, order takeout when hungry, and shop at will online. Just live a happy life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The highly developed living conditions of modern market economy will of course bring about new problems, such as atomized lifestyle, the collapse of family values, the low fertility rate in big cities, etc. But in any case, it is absurd to bring &quot;patriarchy&quot; and &quot;capital&quot; together, because the two are precisely contradictory. &quot;Patriarchy&quot; feels that with the rise of &quot;capital&quot; and the market, their children have gone to big cities, and their authority has collapsed. In &quot;capital&quot;, everyone is a customer. I don&#39;t care whether your customer wants to be a &quot;patriarch&quot; or an &quot;independent woman/man&quot;. Anyway, as long as you pay, I will provide you with products and services. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The free market is an accelerator&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Hayek said that in the capital market, every purchase by customers and consumers is a vote, and the market produces the products that best satisfy their needs. A company, brand or business model that customers want. Ordinary people who were destined to have a humble status in pre-modern society have become owners with the ability to vote in the era of capital markets. This is an important progress. Hayek&#39;s judgment is very correct. Under capital and market conditions, if a woman/man wants to be a &quot;modern independent woman/man&quot;, it will be too late for &quot;capital&quot; to please him and will tend to cater to all the life he likes. way to provide a variety of business services that he prefers. In order to cater to traffic, self-media will also be happy to produce various articles that &quot;modern independent women/men&quot; like to read. To a certain extent, it is precisely in order to cater to customers that &quot;capital&quot; is happy to produce text products such as &quot;Patriarchy and Capitalism&quot; that customers like to read. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a paradox, but the logic of &quot;capital&quot; is indeed the same. Capital will provide whatever customers need. In other words, &quot;capital&quot; itself is neutral and does not matter good or evil. The products it embodies represent the interests of the customer group. As for the consequences after customers enjoy these products, &quot;capital&quot; does not care. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a severely obese junk food lover, &quot;capital&quot; can provide him with a large amount of cheap junk food and &quot;Fat House Happy Water&quot; because this is the demand of customers. For a person who is interested in weight loss and fitness and has strong willpower, &quot;capital&quot; can develop various commercial services for weight loss and fitness, and help this customer achieve a satisfactory body shape. If a person is keen on watching soap operas or playing games, &quot;capital&quot; can provide such nipple entertainment in large quantities at low prices and high quality, and its entertainment effect is unmatched by any pre-modern era. And if a person wants to read high-end classical works, gold inscriptions and silk scrolls, ancient Greek, and Latin, &quot;capital&quot; will also provide them with relevant commercial services, and the price is cheaper than at any time in pre-modern times, and it can be obtained more easily. universal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, &quot;capital&quot; does not care about the value dimension at all. It is neutral and provides whatever customers need. &quot;Patriarchy&quot; and &quot;modern independent women/men&quot; are all value dimensions. Whether a person wants to indulge in fat house happy water or lose weight and keep fit, &quot;capital&quot; can provide services. In other words, &quot;capital&quot; is just a huge, efficient accelerator that helps people get what they need more efficiently. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Everyone pays for their own preferences&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;But the results of these options are paid by the customers themselves, and &quot;capital&quot; is not responsible for the consequences of these choices. As a species of Homo sapiens, many of our &quot;personal hobbies&quot; are actually just natural instincts that have been engraved into our genes for 200,000 years of lifestyle, and are not as &quot;personal&quot; and individual as we imagined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people like pets. The images of pets with chubby round faces and big eyes are actually the closest thing to human infants and young children. In the evolutionary path of Homo sapiens for 200,000 years, this preference for chubby, round faces and big eyes has been engraved into the genes. In pre-modern societies, this was natural. It’s only in modern big cities and with the emergence of new cultures that people have the conditions to deceive this long-term instinct. At this time, &quot;capital&quot; can provide services, such as various pet markets, cute animal industry chains, and cute animal subcultures. As long as customers demand it, &quot;capital&quot; will continue to provide these services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fat House Happy Water, high-sugar and high-oil snacks, etc., the love for sweetness and fat is also an ancient instinct in the long process of evolution and is engraved in genes. It&#39;s just that the body of Homo sapiens never dreamed that the industrial revolution would produce a huge amount of high-carbohydrate food, and it was not adapted to the two, so it often resulted in &quot;fat homes&quot;. &quot;Capital&quot; effectively satisfies this primitive love for carbohydrates and fats, and &quot;fat house&quot; has therefore become a way of life in big cities. The killings and wars in video games are actually the elements that Homo sapiens have been most familiar with for 200,000 years and have been engraved in their genetic instincts, that is, wars or hunting between tribes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, due to the increased threshold after entering big cities and modern life, for example, in the past, a woman might see Zhang San, a young man who was strong and good-looking in the village, and he was an ideal candidate. . But in modern big cities and lifestyles, all kinds of movies, TV shows, advertisements, and short videos are full of handsome Obamas, and the threshold has been greatly increased. So &quot;capital&quot; provides idol dramas, that is to say, &quot;capital&quot; can very efficiently get people&#39;s needs. As for the results after customers get it, &quot;capital&quot; doesn&#39;t care. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The developed capital markets and commerce in modern big cities can completely separate people from small communities such as traditional families and rural areas, and lead a very atomized home-boy and home-girl life. In terms of comfort, this kind of atomized urban individual is relatively comfortable, although it will be accompanied by some problems. Then which lifestyle to choose can be freely chosen based on different people&#39;s time preferences, and &quot;capital&quot; will help them get the content they choose faster. Of course, the lifestyle in modern big cities will also have &quot;capital&quot; to produce related culture to argue that the atomized lifestyle is advanced and free. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people stand in a position of sympathy and understanding of &quot;patriarchy&quot;. From the perspective of conspiracy theory, they feel that this is a &quot;capital conspiracy&quot;, and even speculate that this is a &quot;transnational XX capital conspiracy&quot;, which is to be dismantled. Family and childbearing culture. Objectively speaking, this conspiracy theory is absurd, and no secret group could devise such a conspiracy. This big city phenomenon is actually determined by the neutral force of &quot;capital&quot; itself. This also shows that since it is &quot;capital&quot;, it is impossible to be &quot;patriarchal&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Conclusion&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Capital&quot; is a neutral accelerator, so in this era, groups who choose different values ​​and lifestyles will get the results of their choice more efficiently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some family businesses in the southeast region attach great importance to traditional family values ​​and maintain a relatively good fertility culture. Of course, when doing business with foreign countries, it doesn’t matter what the customers want. But earning money from customers can help the reproduction of your family. In other words, business and your own life are two different things. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Modern developed capital and free markets actually give people more diversified and free choices. If an otaku is willing to choose &quot;Happy Water&quot; and play a successful hero in an online game, that is It&#39;s your choice, just bear the consequences of your choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is precisely &quot;capital&quot; that allows more people to have a variety of choices and live an atomic and individual free life that the ancestors of Homo sapiens never dared to imagine for 200,000 years, with almost no restrictions. constraints of traditional community ties. Therefore, it is absurd to associate “capital” with “patriarchy”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is the author&#39;s personal opinion only and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 18 Oct 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
