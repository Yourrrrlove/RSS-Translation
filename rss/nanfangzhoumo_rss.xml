Of course, it is not only incompatible with the white-collar workers around me, but also particularly dazzling. At first I thought it was the landscaping engineer of the property, but later I found out that it was Tony&#39;s father, Lao Tan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tony drives a Rolls-Royce to work every day. But his father goes out with a hoe every day. I couldn&#39;t help but follow him on my bicycle and found that he had indeed entered the crop field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is said that the 50 acres of crop land is a well-known large wasteland nearby. Who knows what the project was, but it was rotten anyway. Soon after it became wasteland, it was planted with crops by all kinds of people, so it was called crop land. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The question is, Tony is so rich, what is Lao Tan doing? &quot;I can&#39;t help it.&quot; He said to me. If I can&#39;t smell the smell of the land for a day, I can&#39;t eat or sleep, and I can&#39;t stop yawning. As soon as I arrived at the crop field and smelled the familiar atmosphere, I felt energetic all over. Call me cheap, what can I do? When I first came to Shanghai, all the illnesses I had all over my body were cured. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this matter, Tony had quarreled with him countless times, saying that it would seriously damage his image. But Lao Tan ignored him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The principle of crop land is that whoever opens it can plant as much as possible. Everyone has a playful mentality. The land is still deserted anyway, and the developers may come to work at some time. Only Lao Tan admitted the truth. In order to improve the quality of the soil, he collected dog excrement from all over the street and fermented it in a large vat. Even though he sprinkled maggot killers, the smell was still unbearable to the neighbors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He also made his own &quot;vegetable fertilizer&quot;, which was another big vat. He filled the big vat with discarded fruits and vegetables from his own family and neighbors, bought compost strains, and pickled them like pickles. A big lump. Afraid that the soil would become hardened, we even brought in black &quot;soil loosening essence&quot; and spread it everywhere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Anyway, the nice villa was turned into a toilet by him, and Tony vowed to leave him all day long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But you have to admit that Lao Tan is a good at growing crops. You can tell whether the soil is alkaline or acidic by looking at it, by tasting the water, you can tell whether it is too hard or too soft, and by looking at the pests and diseases, you can tell by looking at them: inchworms, armyworms, cabbage caterpillars, cutworms, root maggots, and mustard scale insects. , corn borers, rice planthoppers, red spider mites... For a while, &quot;green ecology&quot; was advocated in the crop fields. A few radicals did not use any medicine, saying that they would rather look ugly than be ecologically organic. The problem is that the insects are ruthless and will eat all the vegetables in just a few days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone invited Lao Tan to dinner and asked Lao Baoshi why the garden was still green without him spraying medicine. Who said no medicine? Lao Tan&#39;s throat suddenly straightened. What&#39;s going on? ! What I took was Chinese medicine. You can’t imagine this! For example, when I was a kid, I used Baibu to wash my hair and kill insects. One kilogram was only 12 yuan online. I brewed Baibu tincture in a big pot, sprayed it and poured it in, and it swept away all the germs and pests! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As he spoke, he waved his big hand fiercely, looking very tall at that moment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thus, despite being looked down upon in the community, when I arrived at the crop fields, it was like Napoleon of Elba returning to France, and my ears were filled with greetings one after another - &quot;Old Tan!&quot; &quot;Master Tan!&quot; !&quot; Some even call him &quot;Dad Tan&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lao Tan felt very useful at this time. He sat on the small horse, took out the dry tobacco pipe he brought from his hometown, puffed for a while, and smiled, his face full of furrows. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, good times do not last long as usual. Gradually, news came out that the developer would be back at work soon. Lao Tan was so worried that he sat in his vegetable garden in a daze every day. He smoked dry tobacco for a while and then reached out to touch the soil. I advised him that it was just temporary, so don’t take it so seriously. He looked towards me. not talking. Just kept rubbing the soil. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Until the large machinery came in, he was still sitting there every day. Let me put it bluntly, since you love the land so much, first, why bother leaving your hometown; second, you can still go back now! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He didn&#39;t speak for a long time. Then he said softly, &quot;I only have a son. My wife has died long ago. If I don&#39;t live with him, who will I live with?&quot; Second, let me tell you, the land in my hometown has long been gone, why don’t I still care about the “crop land” here? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He suddenly cried. Tears flowed freely. Crying with a Hunan accent. I panicked and didn&#39;t know how to persuade him. He sat alone until it was completely dark before returning. Then for a long time, there was no trace of him. Tony&#39;s face looked very ugly. I know they were having a heated argument again. Lao Tan even beat his son, so I was embarrassed to ask about Lao Tan&#39;s whereabouts. I guess I should go back to my hometown. I think. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the day of the beginning of winter, I rode an exercise bike and passed by the town of Sijing, 10 miles away from home. The fields were green and white with dew, and the fields in early winter were empty. On a remote road, a tent struggling in the north wind could be seen. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No, it is just a shack made of large plastic sheets tied with ropes. People in southern Guangdong call it &quot;Liao&quot; and people in Shanghai call it &quot;Pi&quot;. An old man was wrapped in a quilt and huddled there. Next to his head was a pile of foam bowls with traces of a lunch box. At his feet was a bottle of leftover &quot;Wuliang Chun&quot;. The food was in a mess. In front of the floor was a pair of mud-stained shoes. , a pair of socks with fuzzy fabric hanging on the uppers of his shoes, the street light shining on his exhausted face, and he was snoring like thunder. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I coughed slightly, and he woke up and quickly raised his head. I was stunned for a moment, isn’t this Lao Tan! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How can I become a homeless person if I can’t live in a nice villa? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I cooperate with others to grow rice. He smiled reluctantly. Didn&#39;t I tell you that my life is cheap? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Do I have to stay here all night?&quot; I asked. Could anyone still steal? After all, it&#39;s the beginning of winter, and the chilling north wind is making the plastic shack rattle, huddled inside, and it&#39;s like being in the open air. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Old Tan sighed and said, you city people don’t understand many things. First, the most fearful thing about harvesting rice is rain. When it rains, even in the middle of the night or early in the morning, I must urgently &quot;gather the rice&quot;, pile it into a pile, and cover it with a tarpaulin. Second, the rice is drying here, and we are most afraid of being crushed by cars. We only dry half of the road, but there are too many heavy vehicles coming from the &quot;crop fields&quot;. Late at night, everyone came to stop temporarily. My ears were pricked all night long, and the sound of road pressure could be heard far away. I had to wave the signal light to ask them to &quot;raise your hand&quot;, so that at least less rice could be pressed...&quot; Chapter Third, keeping vigil does prevent theft.&quot; Lao Tan said, don&#39;t be surprised, some people steal rice - chickens, ducks and geese, they gain weight when they eat rice, and their egg production also increases, so rice thieves are all motor vehicles, and they shovel run. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rice he is guarding is called &quot;Nanjing No. 46&quot;. The seed fee is 1.6 yuan per catty; the charter fee is 500 yuan per mu; the fertilizer is 200 yuan per mu; and the manpower and machine farming fee is 105 yuan per mu; Pesticides are 115 yuan per mu; electric irrigation fees are 50 yuan per mu; harvesting fees are 100 yuan per mu. In order to ensure a fragrant and soft taste, organic fertilizers such as chicken manure must be applied per acre, as well as threshing and rice milling fees... In this way, the cost of rice per kilogram is more than 3 yuan, and our commercial grain price is 4 It costs 20 cents per catty. In fact, you can’t even earn 1 yuan per catty. With 26 acres of leased land, you only earn 10,000 to 20,000 yuan a year. The cost is so high, so you have to keep vigil. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Farewell, he said he would have to work hard for another four days before returning to the community. His son has made peace with him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the bad news came on the fourth day. That morning, he just got up to pack his things and prepare to go home, but he fell down. Cerebral hemorrhage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Heavy machinery in the crop fields is still roaring. But at the entrance, someone drew a circle and burned a lot of paper money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 14 Sep 2023 22:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[鄂尔多斯重大高压气体泄漏事故致10死3伤，国务院安委会挂牌督办]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256691]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-14 20:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Major production safety accident Notice of Investigation and Punishment of Listing Supervision&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Safety Committee Supervision [2023] No. 11&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; >;People&#39;s Government of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region:&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;On September 7, 2023, a major high-pressure gas leakage occurred at Yiding Ecological Agriculture Development Co., Ltd. in Ordos City, your district, causing 10 people died and 3 were injured. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;According to the &quot;Measures for the Supervision of the Investigation and Handling of Major Accidents,&quot; the State Council Safety Committee decided to implement the supervision of the investigation and handling of this major accident.

One day ago, the Ministry of Education issued a notice and dispatched multiple working groups to various provinces to conduct special employment verification, check the employment data self-check list, verify the self-check report, spot-check relevant employment supporting materials, and opened a supervision and reporting hotline and email address to detect any false employment information. Relevant universities and personnel will be held accountable for violations signed and certified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Flexible employment is the focus of this inspection. Yang Yu, who plans to become a food blogger, is one of them. In previous statistics on his graduation destination, he filled in an annual salary of 300,000-500,000 yuan. Yang Yu said that he really &quot;thought about making this amount. Being an Internet celebrity is very profitable.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He not only wants to do &quot;eating broadcast&quot;, but also hopes to present the character of a blogger who loves life through long videos. However, the data for long videos is not ideal. Currently, the four videos he posted on a certain social media have the highest likes of 49. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 2024 school recruitment season has begun. After delaying entering the job market for a long time, some people have decided to get out of their confusion and re-enter the social chain. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“Flexible Employment”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Today, the real life of food blogger Yang Yu is like this:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Monday to Friday , he and his girlfriend shared a two-bedroom apartment in a county near Zhengzhou. The apartment was located in a community with the best conditions in the county, but their lives depended on online loans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Early on Saturday morning, he first took the bus, then the subway, then the train, and returned to his hometown to teach children how to swim. This job was recommended by a friend at home who owns a swimming pool. Yang Yu likes this job because &quot;he works less and makes more money.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first week after confirming the shared tenancy, Yang Yu and his girlfriend purchased a large bag of oil, salt, sauce, vinegar and pots and pans from the supermarket, moved them from the supermarket to an electric car, and then took them home and moved them upstairs together. . &quot;At that time, I thought that when I finally have my own home, I must cook a lot of my favorite dishes.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But now his concept has changed, &quot;I will measure my time according to the standard of making quick money. If you can earn 200 yuan an hour, then spending an hour cooking is a waste. It is better to spend 20 yuan to eat out.&quot; He started visiting the neighborhood pizza parlor and gained weight compared to when he was a student. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the materials given to the counselor, Yang Yu wrote, &quot;As a perfectionist, I have been constantly testing and adjusting to make myself more confident.&quot; He has been three I haven’t updated the video in months, and my phone is full of test shots. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He himself is aware of the contradiction, &quot;I plan to shoot a new video early the next morning, but the reality is that I usually turn off the alarm clock and go to sleep.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the self-certified flexible employment methods, the &quot;income guarantee letter&quot; provided by Yang Yu is only an extremely niche one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Meng Lan, who graduated from a 211 college in Wuhan majoring in advertising, provided the transaction flow of selling idle items on Xianyu; Wu Xuan, a Chinese major from a normal college, provided screenshots of income and work chats Records to prove her identity as a freelance writer - she experienced failed postgraduate entrance examinations and failed autumn recruitment before graduation, and then decided to return to her hometown to become a freelancer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No matter food bloggers or online store owners, they are not their first choice. Postgraduate entrance examinations and editing examinations are. But Yang Yu has no specific review plan. His daily study time ranges from one hour to five hours. “Sometimes he doesn’t do much in a day, but the study time is just gone.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meng Lan often doubted herself and even developed neurasthenia and depression. &quot;After graduation, I felt sluggish every day and felt that I was incapable of doing many things well.&quot; Now she decided to fight for the next national examination and signed up for the national examination to get off work offline, &quot;from 8 am to 10 pm every day.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since you have to take public and postgraduate entrance exams, why do you call yourself flexible employment? Meng Lan said that before graduation, the counselor and class teacher knew that she would continue to take the civil service exam. They interviewed Meng Lan on the grounds of college employment and suggested that she fill in &quot;self-employment&quot; and the job content was to open a store on Xianyu. &quot;Some of my classmates from World War II were also interviewed by teachers and asked to fill in the form of flexible employment.&quot; According to Meng Lan&#39;s estimate, there are nearly ten people in the class who are in a similar situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Yu’s situation is more complicated. In May 2023, on the school’s employment statistics questionnaire, Yang Yu truthfully filled out “unknown employment direction”. Soon, the counselor contacted him and said that &quot;the college leaders want to help.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two other students in the same major received assistance, and they both got interview opportunities from a unit in Beijing. When he arrived at the interview site, Yang Yu hesitated. &quot;I don&#39;t want to go, the salary is low, and I hate working the night shift. The fundamental reason is that I don&#39;t want to work.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, the three students decided to tell the college that they wanted to do self-media. However, unlike Yang Yu, who thought he could earn three to five million, the other two were conservative in terms of annual salary. They filled in &quot;50,000-100,000.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/nPtS9sHGHvCtbsoSM2IBCSTIk58iOpmTPvNLQjfk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;933&quot; height= &quot;622&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/nPtS9sHGHvCtbsoSM2IBCSTIk58iOpmTPvNLQjfk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250776&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In November 2018, a &quot;eating broadcaster&quot; appeared in Hangzhou, Zhejiang. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Rising year by year&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; Than&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Bloggers, online store owners, and freelance writers are all flexible employment. According to relevant documents from the General Office of the State Council, flexible employment refers to flexible and diverse employment methods such as self-employment, part-time employment, and new employment forms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This formulation appeared in 2002. At that time, the Ministry of Education proposed in its employment work to &quot;actively open up various channels such as temporary employment and flexible employment.&quot; Two years later, it was included in graduate employment statistics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 2021, the &quot;employment rate&quot; of college graduates will be changed to the &quot;graduation destination implementation rate&quot;, which includes the flexible employment rate, which coexists with the agreement and contract employment rate, entrepreneurship rate, and enrollment rate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One concept that needs to be clarified is that the Ministry of Education’s employment rate statistics are different from those of the National Bureau of Statistics, and it is the latter that is more commonly discussed in the media. &quot;In the unemployment rate statistics of the Bureau of Statistics, only the unemployment rate of people who want to be employed is counted. In other words, people who have no intention of employment are not included in the denominator. However, the denominator of the employment rate statistics of colleges and universities is the total number of graduates, and there is no distinction between employment intention.&quot; Feng Xiliang, vice president of the China Labor Society and professor at the School of Labor Economics at Capital University of Economics and Business, pointed out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In employment statistics, there are more and more graduates with &quot;flexible employment&quot;. According to Zhaopin recruitment data, the proportion of flexible employment among college graduates in 2022 has increased by 10.9% compared with 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Flexible employment is indeed a development trend.” Feng Xiliang said, “In the past, flexible employment was mostly skilled work. Due to the development of information technology, new employment forms have emerged in recent years, relying on There are more and more flexible jobs in information networks.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another trend is the flexibility of standard employment. &quot;The boundaries of jobs are becoming increasingly blurred, such as labor dispatch personnel and contract employees. Mobile work blurs the boundaries of previous positions.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Xiliang believes that the statistical standards of colleges and universities should also be adjusted with the development of the times. Three years ago, he suggested that relevant departments appropriately relax the statistical standards of flexible employment. Students who are suitable for the position and those who start their own businesses. For example, Yang Yu and Meng Lan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Flexible employment is becoming a &quot;reservoir&quot; in graduate employment rate statistics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters noticed that taking universities in Hebei Province as an example, according to the employment quality reports released by each university, the flexible employment rate of undergraduates in Chengde Medical College, Baoding University, and Hebei Normal University for Nationalities in 2022 exceeded 50 %. Among them, the total number of graduates of Hebei Normal University for Nationalities in 2022 is 3,294, and the total number of flexible employment is 1,941, accounting for 58.93%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Xiliang is cautious about the flexible employment rate of nearly 60%. According to Feng Xiliang&#39;s 2021 survey, about 14% of graduates choose flexible employment, of which about 70% are active, and about 30% are &quot;passively&quot; employed flexibly because they cannot find a suitable job or during the transition period. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In that survey, after completing 8,604 valid questionnaires in 30 universities, Feng Xiliang found that the flexible employment rates of different schools and majors vary. “Graduates of art and foreign language majors have flexible employment options. The proportion of employment is higher, and the flexible employment rate is higher in junior colleges than in undergraduate schools.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Half Moon Talk&quot; report, some colleges and universities are cheating on their employment rates. Counselors told students in the WeChat group, &quot;If you can&#39;t find a job, just write flexible employment when filling out the form&quot; and &quot;If you encounter a survey, just write &quot;flexible employment&quot; He said he was doing self-media.&quot; A counselor at a Beijing science and engineering 211 college also told a reporter from Beijing Youth Daily that some &quot;edge balls&quot; will be played in the employment rate, such as registering part-time jobs as flexible employment. This category does not require a tripartite agreement and can be counted. into the employment rate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the routine verification of the employment rate of graduates of the Ministry of Education in 2023, flexible employment has become the focus of the verification. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/IMonWDCtySveZYKhvmALzex4Z80tSKVUHLiLcnmY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; height= &quot;647&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/IMonWDCtySveZYKhvmALzex4Z80tSKVUHLiLcnmY.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250777&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 20, 2023, an outdoor night market job fair was held in Guanyun County, Lianyungang City, Jiangsu Province. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Verification&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;How to check flexible employment? Southern Weekend reporters noted that the main methods for verifying employment data in each province are intra-provincial inspections, self-inspections within schools, mutual inspections between colleges, and supervision and reporting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take provincial inspections as an example. In early July 2023, the Hunan Provincial Department of Education issued a notice requiring schools with a flexible employment rate of more than 20% to submit a special inspection report. The report includes the reasons, inspection status, Correction results and other information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some universities in Hunan Province have made this ratio even stricter. Hunan Institute of Technology proposed that secondary colleges with a flexible employment rate of more than 15% &quot;need to strictly check the flexible employment categories and submit a written flexible employment verification report.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Xiliang analyzed that the Hunan Provincial Department of Education’s flexible employment rate red line may have been set with reference to the previous flexible employment situation of college students. According to statistics from the National College Student Information Consultation and Employment Guidance Center, flexible employment accounts for 16.9% of college graduates in the country in 2020, and 16.25% of college graduates in 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“But 20% is not an absolutely correct red line, and relevant departments can control it more flexibly.” Feng Xiliang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the school level, there are also &quot;self-examinations&quot; and &quot;mutual examinations&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 12, 2023, Jining Medical College issued an announcement stating that when secondary colleges conduct mutual inspections, flexible employment telephone interview verification must &quot;achieve 100% coverage.&quot; The announcement also stated that the Shandong Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security will organize on-site cross-checks between colleges and universities five days before graduates leave school. The team will be led by the leader in charge of employment, carrying laptops and all employment certification materials, and will conduct cross-checks between schools. A list of inspection opinions and issues will be formed, and “if no problems are found during the inspection, but problems are discovered later in the inspection by the superior organization, the relevant inspection units shall bear joint and several liability.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Surveillance calls are another method of verifying employment rates. Southern Weekend reporters contacted seven colleges and universities through the published supervision and reporting hotlines, and the responses they received were all &quot;no reports have been received from students so far.&quot; However, there is not much difference in the verification methods. A staff member of the Employment Office of Yunnan Special Education Vocational College told Southern Weekend reporters that if a student does not have a &quot;formal job&quot; but &quot;his department and major report that he has a job or flexible employment&quot;, then the Employment Office &quot;will step by step Downward, the responsible persons of departments, majors, classes, counselors and teachers are held accountable.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The verification process of student reports is somewhat difficult. The Employment Office of Inner Mongolia Agricultural University told Southern Weekend reporters that students choosing to report with their real names will be more conducive to the school&#39;s investigation and verification one by one. A staff member of the Employment Office of Inner Mongolia Normal University said that the Education Department had reported that there were anonymous reports from students at the school, but because the school was unable to obtain student information, it could only conduct a large-scale investigation to see whether teachers had said or done these things. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Back to the social chain&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Neither really employed nor After preparing for the exam with all their strength, several flexible employment graduates interviewed revealed complex group characteristics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They all have certain financial security provided by their families. The family hopes that Meng Lan will continue to take the civil service exam next year. &quot;We have not considered the option of working directly. Now I am preparing for the exam at home. I have no source of income, but I have sufficient support from my family.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Xuan’s father likes his daughter to cook for him at home. “He thinks it would be good for me to be a full-time daughter.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Xiliang’s research found that family economic foundation, digital development and professional matching will all affect students’ tendency to choose flexible employment. &quot;If parents have a certain financial foundation and can give their children space to develop freely, graduates will get more understanding and support. In addition, digital background is the biggest technical factor, and mastering digital technology provides a foundation for college students to find flexible employment.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;Compared with flexible employment, Yang Yu and Meng Lan&#39;s status is actually closer to &quot;slow employment&quot;, that is, they neither intend to find employment immediately nor continue their studies after graduation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;2023 College Student Employability Survey Report&quot; released by Zhaopin Recruitment in May 2023, among the 2023 graduates, the proportion of &quot;slow employment&quot; increased from 15.9% in 2022 to 18.9%, which is close to the overall rate. one-fifth of . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We are different from the older generation. We don’t have to worry about survival issues after graduation. I can go to graduate school, make money, start a business as a food blogger, or even take the civil service exam if I can’t. I have many options, so I won’t be anxious,” Yang Yu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The trouble is that he still doesn’t know what he really wants to do. &quot;Although there are many choices in front of me, I need to work hard for any future, and I have nothing now.&quot; Walking on the road, he is often swept away by a sense of emptiness, and has not yet adapted to the fact that he is no longer part of the social chain. &quot;College students here&quot;. &quot;I used to think it was not good to go to school for too long. After I graduated, I found that I didn&#39;t want to grow up and wanted to go to school more.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Yu’s latest food shop exploration material was shot on August 4. He made up his mind, “I will definitely post a new video within three days.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;My parents said before that if you don&#39;t pass the public examination, you can do whatever you want. But I still haven&#39;t done what I originally wanted to do. Sometimes, I don&#39;t know Is it the constraints of the family or the constraints of myself?&quot; Meng Lan had been working as a contract photographer when she was in college. She once hoped that this love would turn into a long-term career, but now she is fully preparing for the public examination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yue Changjun, deputy dean of the School of Education at Peking University, once wrote that in recent years, phenomena such as &quot;postgraduate entrance examination fever&quot;, &quot;graduate entrance examination fever&quot; and &quot;slow employment&quot; among college graduates can reflect that graduates have not yet prepared for future employment. Be fully prepared in terms of capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Xiliang believes that the mentality of this generation of college students is closely related to the impact of the three-year epidemic. &quot;Universities are spending their time during the epidemic. Classes and internships may be online. They are more inclined to use virtual networks to understand society and solve problems, and have little contact with the real society.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;True realization Wu Xuan, who wanted flexible employment, decided to go to work after two months of experience as a freelance writer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The income from freelance writing is neither stable nor considerable. Wu Xuan also noticed changes in her mental state. During the two months of free life, her willingness to work became less and less. &quot;Lack of contact with others&quot; People’s deep links are gradually closed.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After discovering that the flexible employment life was not in line with expectations, Wu Xuan finally chose to become a junior high school Chinese teacher in his hometown. Although the shift system restricted her freedom, she &quot;finally felt that she had entered the social chain and was no longer so anxious.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(At the request of the interviewees, Yang Yu, Meng Lan, and Wu Xuan are pseudonyms)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p >;</description><pubDate> Thu, 14 Sep 2023 20:25:14 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[癌症老人乘机被拒，哪些情况不能飞？川航称艾滋患者需报备]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256689]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-14 19:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On September 12, a passenger with cancer was denied boarding when checking in at Chengdu Tianfu International Airport. . The passenger who was denied boarding was suspected to have been suffering from cancer for four months, according to live video captured by a bystander. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The live video showed that at about 9:45 a.m. that day, at the boarding gate of flight EU2205, an elderly man was sitting in a wheelchair, and the man and the elderly woman, who were suspected to be family members, were sitting on the ground. The man shouted to the staff: &quot;The commitment book has been signed and the hospital certificate has been written. I also brought a nurse with me. You won&#39;t let me leave.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, the man was suspected of working with another employee of the airline company. The staff called, &quot;I have cancer, four months ago.

Otherwise, if the ground handling staff thinks that the elderly person is &quot;apathetic&quot; when boarding, he may be refused boarding. After being refused boarding, &quot;responsibility&quot; Passengers need to bear the responsibility themselves.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, when Nandu reporters further asked about the criteria for judging &quot;apathetic&quot;, customer service was unable to give a specific description. However, no relevant provisions were found in the &quot;General Conditions for Domestic Transportation of Passengers and Baggage of Chengdu Airlines Co., Ltd.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to inquiries from Nandu reporters, various airlines have different standards for not accepting flights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the relevant provisions of the &quot;Public Air Transport Passenger Service Management Regulations&quot; issued by the Ministry of Transport in 2021: The general conditions of transportation should at least include: &quot;Relevant regulations for passengers taking flights, including infants, pregnant women, and unaccompanied by adults&quot; Carriage standards for special passengers such as children and seriously ill patients.&quot; In other words, airlines can set operating standards in this regard, but there are no specific regulations on what the specific standards are. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, China Southern Airlines clearly stipulates that chickenpox patients cannot fly until the damaged area has recovered; cerebrovascular patients. For patients with cerebral embolism, cerebral hemorrhage, and brain tumors, the roar, vibration, and lack of oxygen during takeoff and landing can aggravate their condition and are prohibited from flying. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sichuan Airlines Co., Ltd. stipulates that passengers who require special care due to physical reasons or who must meet certain conditions can only be transported in compliance with Sichuan Airlines’ transportation regulations, with Sichuan Airlines’ prior consent, and when necessary. Transportation will be accepted only after arrangements have been made. This includes seriously ill passengers, stretcher passengers, those who need premature infant incubators, and passengers with AIDS without any external injuries.

According to the Beijing News, on September 2, this year&#39;s No. 9 Typhoon &quot;Sura&quot; landed in Guangdong at the level of a strong typhoon. Affected by the typhoon weather, many trees on the roadside on Beihuan Avenue, Futian District, Shenzhen were blown down by strong winds. , a car was hit by a tree, killing one person and injuring two others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a report by &quot;City Zero Distance&quot; in July this year, affected by Typhoon Taili, a banyan tree in the community where Mr. Lu lived in Zhongshan City was blown down and hit his car. The damage was very serious. In this regard, the property management said, &quot;We hope that the owner will drive the vehicle to a maintenance point or 4S shop for repair as soon as possible. We have a &#39;public liability insurance&#39; ourselves. After the owner completes the repair, he will report the quotation and catalog to us simultaneously, and we will report it to the insurance Company.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the above two incidents were related to natural disasters, vehicles were smashed and even caused casualties. The parties involved and their families will definitely seek corresponding relief afterwards. Take the community as an example. There have been many disputes before about whether the property management company is responsible for being hit by a tree when a car is parked in the community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is such a case in Beijing Haidian Court. The party involved, Mr. Zhang, said that it rained heavily that night and the tree fell down, causing damage to his vehicle parked in the community, and the roots of the tree had bulged out of the ground before it fell. Therefore, he filed a lawsuit with the court and requested the property company to compensate for various losses. . The property company argued that, first, the community involved in the case is a non-operating asset, it does not charge property fees and parking fees, and only provides minimum basic guarantees. The property company is not the owner or manager of the trees; second, the gardening department stipulates that private property rights are not allowed. Dealing with trees, so even if the tree roots bulged out of the ground before, it could not deal with it; thirdly, the heavy rain that night was force majeure. In addition, Mr. Zhang’s car has been repaired by insurance and cannot be compensated again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, the court held that the property management company was the property service company of the disputed community. Although it did not collect the property service fees or parking fees paid by the owners, it was still responsible for the equipment, facilities and equipment in the community. The manager of this matter is the manager of the broken tree in this case. Although the property company claimed that it was not at fault for the broken trees, the evidence submitted was not enough to prove that it had fulfilled its reasonable management and maintenance obligations for the trees involved, and both parties acknowledged that the roots of the trees involved had bulged out of the ground before the incident. But the property company did not deal with it. In addition, although there was heavy rain on the night of the incident, it was still a natural force. The property company’s defense that it was force majeure could not be established. Therefore, the property management company should bear corresponding responsibilities. However, because the vehicle maintenance fees claimed by Mr. Zhang have been compensated by insurance, the court cannot support Mr. Zhang’s request for the property company to pay him this part of the expenses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regarding the property management responsibility for the trees in the community, Article 1257 of the Civil Code stipulates that if the owner or manager of the forest causes damage to others due to breaking, toppling, or falling fruit, etc., and the owner or manager of the forest cannot prove that he is not at fault, Should bear infringement liability. This shows that as long as they are within the community, trees are within the jurisdiction of the property. If the property owner refuses compensation on the grounds that it is subject to force majeure factors such as typhoons or heavy rains rather than daily management, the reason is untenable. Due to advance forecasts such as typhoons, property management companies should inspect and reinforce trees planted in ground-level open-air parking lots in advance to avoid damage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, the best way for property companies to avoid similar situations is to learn from the community properties reported in &quot;Nanjing Zero Distance&quot; and purchase property insurance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Property insurance means that the property pays insurance premiums to the insurance company, and both parties sign an insurance contract. After the occurrence of causes, accidents, and disasters within the scope of the contract, the insurance company will bear the compensation within the scope of the contract. Property insurance covers a wide range of areas. Among them, public liability insurance refers to the financial compensation liability for the victim that the insured party shall bear in accordance with the law due to damage to other people&#39;s personal or property due to his or her fault in public places. By purchasing this type of insurance, the insurance company will pay compensation if there are problems such as damage to vehicles or even people caused by trees in the community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Who will pay the premium? The &quot;Regulations on the Administration of Property Service Charges&quot; stipulates that property service costs or property service expenditures include shared parts of the property, shared facilities and equipment, and public liability insurance costs. That is, the property fees charged by the property to the owners include public liability insurance costs. Therefore, in the event of a &quot;car being hit by a tree in a community&quot; incident, the property owner should pay compensation first and then seek compensation from the insurance company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the judgment of the Beijing Haidian Court provides another solution. If car owners purchase car damage insurance (vehicle loss insurance), they can make claims on their own to the insurance company. According to the car damage insurance of an insurance company, compensation will be provided for vehicle losses caused by fire, explosion, collapse of external objects, falling objects in the air, lightning strikes, windstorms, tornadoes, heavy rains, floods, etc. However, car damage insurance is a voluntary insurance policy for car owners, and currently this model is still niche. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Shenzhen case, because the accident occurred in a public area, according to the Civil Code, the owner and manager of the tree should also be held liable, unless they can fully prove that the cause of the accident was force majeure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, catastrophe insurance can also cover the cost sharing of compensation for accidents involving trees hitting cars and people in this municipal area. As one of the first catastrophe insurance pilot cities in my country, Ningbo City has launched a catastrophe insurance pilot project in 2014. The Ningbo Civil Affairs Bureau, on behalf of the Ningbo Municipal Government, signed a catastrophe insurance contract with the Ningbo Branch of PICC Property and Casualty Insurance Company as the policy holder. , the protection content not only covers household property losses caused by typhoons, heavy rains, etc., but also includes personal injury and death liability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that through the coverage of property insurance and the promotion of various types of insurance such as car damage insurance and catastrophe insurance, when disasters such as typhoons occur, resulting in losses of people and property such as trees hitting cars, etc., whether it occurs in the community Both indoors and in urban public areas, we can achieve the maximum goal of &quot;no longer having to admit that we are unlucky in the event of a disaster.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is the author&#39;s personal opinion only and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 14 Sep 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[农业农村部：“村播”是乡村振兴的新型人才]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256669]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-14 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/14/QlxZKn8nGYMOEvcJ2FGQKwMnaWciu5CKBUu5vtw3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height=&quot;714&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/QlxZKn8nGYMOEvcJ2FGQKwMnaWciu5 CKBUu5vtw3. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250775&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 8, 2023, fruit farmers in Zhuxi Town, Cengong County, Guizhou Province broadcast live Selling golden autumn pears. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(People&#39;s Vision/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rural areas, like cities, have huge consumption potential. On September 12, 2023, Zhang Guoqing, deputy director of the Information Center of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said that farmers’ income has grown faster than urban residents for 11 consecutive years, and the township and village consumer markets account for 38% of my country’s total consumer market, but to To build a connection between resources and markets and promote the further development of rural economy, &quot;village broadcasters&quot; who use short videos and live broadcast tools are also needed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the same day, Zhang Guoqing said in his speech at the Kuaishou Light Chasing Conference that as a new type of talent for rural revitalization, &quot;village broadcasters&quot; have brought the &quot;source of living water&quot; of talents to rural revitalization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The emphasis on &quot;village broadcasting&quot; is to a large extent inseparable from the development trend of Internet e-commerce. At a special press conference on August 15, 2023, Li Gang, Director of the Circulation Development Department of the Ministry of Commerce, introduced that in 2022, the national rural online retail sales will reach 2.17 trillion yuan, and the online retail sales of agricultural products will reach 531.38 billion yuan, which is similar to that in 2014. Compared with the same period last year, it increased by 11 times and 4 times year-on-year. By the end of 2022, the number of rural online merchants (stores) nationwide has reached 17.303 million, and the number of rural Internet users nationwide has exceeded 300 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Suning County, Hebei Province alone, a small county located at the western end of the central city of Cangzhou, more than 6,500 online fishing rod and fishing gear shops have already solved the employment problem for nearly a quarter of the local population. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Chaohui, director of the Digital Economy Development Service Center in Suning County, Hebei Province, said that among the local 340,000 permanent residents, 30,000 are directly engaged in e-commerce, and 85,000 are indirectly engaged in packaging, video production and other related work. The products are online The sales rate is over 90%. According to a previous report by China News Network, a 3-hour live broadcast in early July 2023 attracted 150,000 viewers from a &quot;village broadcaster&quot; in Suning County, and the transaction volume in a single session exceeded 100,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 12, 2023, the 26-year-old &quot;village broadcaster&quot; Gerong Zhuom, as a representative of new farmers, once again recalled the first attempt that took place in 2017. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On a mountain more than 5,000 meters high, she posted her first video under the account &quot;Hide Dolma&quot;. It was a snowy May. In the camera, she was walking among exposed rocks, bending down to look for wild cordyceps. Behind her was a gray valley, and a snow-white stream was vaguely visible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unexpectedly, this 14-second daily record received more than 500,000 views the next day. In private messages, hundreds of strangers from far away offered to buy Cordyceps. &quot;I sold it for more than 2,000 yuan at that time, and I was very happy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past six years, more and more new farmers like Gerong Zhuom have appeared on camera as &quot;village broadcasters&quot;. They sell agricultural products through short videos and live broadcasts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Zhang Guoqing introduced that as early as 2022, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League jointly launched the Kuaishou platform with the goal of increasing farmers’ income and strengthening the county economy in 160 national key counties for rural revitalization. Focus on supporting the cultivation of &quot;rural youth anchors&quot; in counties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The emphasis on rural talents has been written into the No. 1 Central Document of 2023. In the &quot;agriculture, rural areas and farmers&quot; work in 2023 and in the future period, it is necessary to &quot;strengthen the construction of rural talent teams&quot;, implement the rural revitalization talent support plan and the high-quality farmer cultivation plan, and carry out the cultivation of rural entrepreneurial leaders has been included in the plan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“By the end of 2022, the number of people across the country who have returned to their hometowns to start businesses has reached 12.2 million, driving more than 34 million rural employment, and the coverage rate of innovation and entrepreneurship among rural returnees has reached 83.6%.” And.

Some family members told Southern Weekend reporters that they participated in the matching donation activities of Ke Mouxiao, the &quot;Hebei project leader&quot; of the Chinese Children&#39;s Charity Association. According to the early publicity, taking &quot;48,500 to match 1,500&quot; as an example, parents raise 48,500 yuan to &quot;donate&quot; to the designated account. After 20 days to a month, they can receive the principal plus 1,500 yuan in matching donations, a total of 50,000 yuan. Yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many patients had participated in this project, and their families had no doubts. It was not until the end of August 2023 that the promised funds were not paid back, and they discovered that they had been cheated. Wang Jun, a family member of the patient, told Southern Weekend reporters that preliminary statistics from parents revealed that a total of 88 families had been defrauded, involving more than 9 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of September 13, the China Children’s Charity Association issued a statement denying that Ke Mouxiao was a staff member of the association and had never entrusted Ke Mouxiao to personally raise funds for the 9958 Children’s Emergency Relief Project (hereinafter referred to as 9958). funds. As for the 10 million yuan of funds circulated online, the statement stated that the association&#39;s account had never received these funds. &quot;The person involved transferred the funds to Ke Mouxiao&#39;s personal account and received rebates from Ke Mouxiao&#39;s personal account.&quot; Staff of the Chinese Children&#39;s Charity Association told the media that Ke Mouxiao was a volunteer and the police had opened a case for fraud by impersonating him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/i07q2brvtfYqkvkqU8kr4AGmBBrqgc9slafRzILq.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;1242&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/i07q2brvtfYqkvkqU8kr4AGmBBrqgc9slafRzILq.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250785&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 13, the Chinese Children’s Charity Association issued a statement. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(China Children&#39;s Charity Association official website/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The customary &quot;matching donation&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The afternoon of September 13 When Southern Weekend reporters came to the entrance of the Chinese Children&#39;s Charity Society in Beijing, some family representatives entered the Children&#39;s Charity Society office to communicate, while more family members of the children were waiting outside the hospital. Most of them take their children to seek medical treatment in other places, from Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan and other places to Hebei Yanda Ludaopei Hospital and Shandong Provincial Cancer Hospital for treatment, and rent houses near the hospitals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yan’s child was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a very rare childhood cancer, when she was two years old. For this reason, her family traveled from Sichuan to Shandong Cancer Hospital for treatment. In the past two years, the family has spent millions of yuan on treatment. &quot;Immunotherapy costs hundreds of thousands a month, all at my own expense.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After her child was diagnosed, Li Yan joined a patient group. In the patient group, she found that people often posted information on fundraising and matching donations for serious illness relief, and patients always participated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the pages displayed by some parents, the descriptions of these matching donation notices are simple, such as &quot;101,500, matched with 2,500, repayment in one month&quot; and &quot;There is only one quota this month, sign up if you want.&quot; Li Yan said that the amount of matching donations is different each time, and the number of participants is also different. Taking a 49,000 yuan matching donation of 1,000 yuan as an example, parents will raise 49,000 yuan themselves to invest in the project, and they must also provide a 50,000 yuan medical invoice in order to receive a 50,000 yuan return. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many parents said that the matching donation rebates were sometimes transferred back to the parents’ personal accounts, and sometimes were transferred directly to the hospital’s designated account. Parents used the reimbursement documents to write them off one by one. “They can’t take them out, they can only use them. Treated in hospital.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For parents, having a seriously ill child at home is a heavy burden. &quot;A cold for ordinary people is just a trivial matter. For them (leukemia patients), it may cost tens of thousands of dollars to treat.&quot; Chen Chen, another parent at the scene, said that his 12-year-old daughter suffers from myeloid leukemia and is only a child. A box of targeted drugs costs more than 30,000 yuan. &quot;We are very willing to match the donation of 1,000 or 2,000 yuan to pay the rent and improve the food.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the process of taking care of the children, the families of the children shared their treatment experience, comforted and understood each other, and formed a A different sense of trust. Li Yan calls the patients who were diagnosed earlier as &quot;seniors&quot;. She knows that some patients have been making matching donations for several years, and they all get their money back normally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other patients value the &quot;signature&quot; of Project 9958. It is organized by the Chinese Children&#39;s Charity Association and is known to almost all families of children with the disease. When soliciting parents to make matching donations, organizers will ask whether they have been registered. &quot;Filing&quot; refers to entering the files of the Children&#39;s Charity Society 9958 project. Parents scan the QR code to fill out the &quot;Chinese Children&#39;s Charity Society 9958 Children&#39;s Emergency Rescue Center Application Form (Langfang)&quot; and provide the child&#39;s name, age, condition and other information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“You know that many people have done this before, and everyone has a default attitude towards this matter.” Li Yan said that it was this normalized operation method and the mutual trust between patients that made her enthusiastic about the project. There is no doubt about the authenticity. In addition, seriously ill children require careful care, and parents are devoted both physically and mentally to their children, making it difficult to have the energy to verify the authenticity of the project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 25, Li Yan and several patients at Shandong Cancer Hospital transferred 48,500 yuan to Zhang’s account. Zhang transferred the money layer by layer and remitted it to Ke Xiao, and it was agreed on September 15 Refund of 50,000 yuan. But in early September, they learned that the previous batch of patients&#39; money had not been paid back in time, and Ke Mouxiao had also lost contact. Only then did they realize that the money could not be recovered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jun, whose family members were being treated at Ludaopei Hospital in Yanda, Hebei Province, told Southern Weekend reporters that after Ke Mouxiao failed to pay his patients back in time on August 30, more than a dozen family members came to Ke Mouxiao to ask for an explanation. After Ke Mouxiao refused many times, the parents jointly reported the case to the police in Yanjiao, Hebei Province. After the police filed the case, they took criminal detention measures against Ke Mouxiao. After the accident, the families of the children asked each other. Most parents participated in the projects of &quot;48,500 for 1,500,&quot; &quot;101,500 for 2,500,&quot; and &quot;126,000 for 4,000.&quot; &quot;The minimum investment was 48,000, and the most was more than 300,000.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/t6oBhADmLsHcKeDOgIshQ4Nf6U88M5Q3UTyi9HX9.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1079&quot; height= &quot;1079&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/t6oBhADmLsHcKeDOgIshQ4Nf6U88M5Q3UTyi9HX9.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250786&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Information records of the patient’s family members participating in the “matching donation” project. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Volunteers of &quot;Best Leadership&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In fact , similar charity matching scams have appeared many times.

It is a national public foundation under the supervision of the Ministry of Civil Affairs. It mainly provides assistance to children in need and those who have no one to support them in the aspects of medical care, growth, education, culture and sports, etc. Carry out assistance activities for children, left-behind children, street children, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 9958 Children’s Emergency Relief Project was established in 2012. It is a self-owned brand project of the China Children’s Charity Association. This project serves the group of children in need aged 0-18 years old, integrating information services, financing channel services, Three major functions of rescue execution services. According to the official website of the China Children&#39;s Charity Association, 9958 has currently established more than 50 cooperation projects, established an emergency rescue channel network and 25 rescue sub-centers across the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the statement of the Chinese Children’s Charity Association, Ke Mouxiao only served as a short-term volunteer in the association’s 9958 Children’s Emergency Relief Project Hebei Langfang Regional Cooperation Agency, and the parents’ transfer was made to Ke Mouxiao personal account. Southern Weekend reporters learned at the scene that the fundraising matching donations of the parents interviewed were indeed not transferred to the public account of the 9958 project, but were transferred to multiple different personal accounts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despite this, parents all believe that Ke’s filial behavior is related to the Children’s Charity Association. Many parents told Southern Weekend reporters that to participate in the matching donation project for the first time, they must scan the QR code and fill out the &quot;Chinese Children&#39;s Charity Association 9958 Children&#39;s Emergency Rescue Center Application Form (Langfang)&quot;. Pan Changrong, 60, said that his grandson was being treated at Lu Daopei Hospital for leukemia. Their information It has been entered into the system of the Children&#39;s Charity Association, &quot;indicating that the code is real.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the family members said that the statement of matching donation receipts showed that the appropriator was the Chinese Children&#39;s Charity Society, and based on this, they believed that these matching donation projects were regular projects operated and implemented by the China Children&#39;s Charity Society. However, no parents showed relevant payment receipts to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jun said that before September 7, parents could still see Ke Mouxiao’s personal introduction on the official website of the Chinese Children’s Charity Association, indicating that he was the director of the Langfang team of the 9958 project, but on 9 When formally communicating with the Chinese Children&#39;s Charity Association on March 8, parents discovered that the relevant information had been deleted from the official website. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the person in charge of the China Children&#39;s Charity Association also issued a contract termination document to the family members who came to communicate. The contract termination document stated that &quot;the contracting agency of Langfang Rescue Station of Children&#39;s Charity Society&#39;s 9958 Rescue Project is Tianjin Beichen District Tianjuan Public Welfare Service Center. Because the rescue volume did not meet the standards and did not meet the development needs of the 9958 Children&#39;s Emergency Rescue Project, after evaluation, The contract with the Langfang Rescue Station was terminated on March 31, 2023. After the termination of the contract, any nominal fundraising, publicity and other activities conducted by the 9958 Rescue Project Langfang Rescue Station have nothing to do with the 9958 Children&#39;s Emergency Relief Project of the China Children&#39;s Charity Society.&quot; Southern Weekend reporters saw from the photo that the document was stamped with the official seal of the Children&#39;s Charity Association and was signed on March 31, 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jun said that after the case was filed and accepted by the police, the police asked the person in charge of the project of the Chinese Children&#39;s Charity Association about this situation, and the other party admitted that the termination letter was issued in the past two days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jun pointed out that there is still an article on the national online platform training event released in February on the public account of 9958 Children&#39;s Emergency Rescue, with a picture showing that Ke Mouxiao was awarded the &quot;China Children&#39;s Charity Association&quot; Best Leadership Award 2022”. During the signing ceremony, it was Ke Mouxiao who signed the contract and took a group photo as the representative of the Langfang team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon of September 13, staff of the China Children’s Charity Association stated that they were temporarily unable to accept interviews from Southern Weekend reporters, and the above information could not be confirmed. In a subsequent statement, the Chinese Children&#39;s Charity Association did not explain the above information. It only mentioned that Ke Mouxiao was currently detained by the Yanjiao Public Security Bureau of the Sanhe City Public Security Bureau in Hebei Province and was under investigation. They also reported to the public security organs. Report and actively cooperate with the public security organs in their investigations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Family representatives who communicated with the Chinese Children&#39;s Charity Association told Southern Weekend reporters that the Chinese Children&#39;s Charity Association told parents that the case has been criminally filed and they need to wait until the police investigation is completed to determine how much money can be recovered. How much compensation to pay. &quot;But many families can&#39;t wait that long, and their children are in the hospital.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the same day, Tencent Charity and Sina Micro Public Welfare issued respective responses, saying that the suspected fraud of 9958 did not occur on the platform, but based on In accordance with the platform operating rules, industry self-discipline conventions and user-oriented principles, fundraising for all 9958 projects has been suspended pending the investigation results of government departments, and further processing will be carried out based on the results.

While OpenAI was still losing money, a British island in the Caribbean actually made money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This place is Anguilla. With an area of ​​only 96 square kilometers and a population of only 16,000, it earned Al dividends because the top-level domain name suffix in Anguilla is .ai. AI is booming and a large number of startups have registered product URLs with the .ai suffix. A .ai domain name costs about $70 per year. As a result, Anguilla got a pie that fell from the sky. This year&#39;s government revenue is expected to surge by US$30 million, equivalent to 10% of annual GDP. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The highest management organization for domain names in the world is called ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), the Chinese abbreviation for Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. It is an established A non-profit international organization in October 1998. Originally a non-profit organization under the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. government announced in 2016 that ICANN would no longer be affiliated with the Department of Commerce and become a self-managed independent organization. Of course, the United States certainly has a lot of influence on it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;ICANN is responsible for managing the operation of the world&#39;s domain name system. One of its main tasks is to formulate the top level domain name (top level domain) and stipulate which strings can be used as top level domain names. The so-called top-level domain name (TLD) is the highest-level domain name, which is the last part of the website address. For example, .com, .cn. Today&#39;s domain name types can be divided into three major categories. One is .com, .net, .org, .info, .biz, etc., which can be said to be global domain names. The second is country or regional domain names, such as .cn Chinese domain name, .us American domain name, .uk British domain name, .de German domain name, etc., which are only two letters in length. The third is new top-level domain names, such as .top domain name, .vip domain name, .xyz domain name, .app domain name, .site domain name, etc., with suffix length starting from 3 characters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;ICANN cannot manage more than a thousand domain name suffixes by itself, and it is not appropriate to charge this money for being both a referee and a player, so ICANN provides services for every top-level player. Find a reliable registry (host) for the domain name, which will be responsible for managing the server, registration, use, fees and other matters of this domain name. A registry can also manage multiple domain name suffixes at the same time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Verisign currently manages the .com domain name suffix. Verisign also manages the .cc domain name, .net domain name, and .tv domain name. . Generally speaking, for security reasons, country or regional domain names will be managed by ICANN to the government organizations of the country or region. The China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC) manages the .cn domain name suffix. CNNIC also manages the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC). domain name. The domain name registry only has management rights and cannot participate in market transactions. Therefore, there are many domain name registrars under the Domain Name Registry, including Alibaba Cloud, Yuming.com, Tencent Cloud, Baidu Cloud, etc. in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Country or regional domain name registration usually requires payment of a certain fee, which depends on the type of domain name, top-level domain name and registrar. Registration fees are usually annual and require periodic renewal to maintain ownership of the domain name. The price of a domain name is determined by the domain name registry. For example, the price of cn domain name is determined by China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC). This is the cost price of the domain name. After the domain name registry sets the bulk registration price (wholesale price) for domain name suffixes, the domain name registrar service platform will charge corresponding registration fees and a certain percentage of service fees based on this standard. Domain name registrars have to complete the real-name authentication of domain names and domain name resolution services on behalf of the government, and earn hard-earned money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;So, a large part of the money Anguilla earns should be due to the country or local hosting companies raising prices. In Deyue, local people registered some domain names and then sold them to the companies that wanted them first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, for hosting providers, the higher the domain name price, the better. First of all, the supply of domain names is actually unlimited. There can be countless domain names in front of a top-level domain name suffix. Therefore, if the hosting agreement is set too high, the sales volume will be reduced, and the total revenue may be reduced. Secondly, domain names still have certain alternatives. For example, you can use .com, .cn, and .net. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A good domain name plays an important role in gathering corporate visibility and popularity. More importantly, the domain name is the identity mark in the Internet era and has &quot;uniqueness&quot;. This becomes an asset. Generally speaking, domain name registration is based on a first-come, first-served principle. Whoever registers it early belongs to it. If a latecomer needs it, he or she will have to pay for it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For enterprises, especially large enterprises, domain names are a signal of strength. The reason is very simple. If a company does not have the most suitable domain name for itself, then the domain name must have been registered and the company does not have the strength to buy it back. Therefore, Internet companies are highly dependent on domain names. JD.com, Xiaomi, and Apple all spend a lot of money to buy domain names that are more suitable for them. It has been reported that Apple paid approximately US$1.5 million to acquire the domain http://icloud.net; earlier it spent a huge sum of nearly US$5.2 million for http://icloud.com. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Of course, this kind of domain name registration is not a first-come, first-served basis without a bottom line. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to Article 8 of the &quot;China Internet Network Information Center Domain Name Dispute Resolution Measures&quot;, you can complain about some domain name registrations. For example, the domain name complained of is the same as the name or logo in which the complainant has civil rights and interests, or is similar enough to cause confusion; the domain name holder complained of does not have legitimate rights and interests in the domain name or its main part; the domain name holder complained of has no legitimate rights and interests. Someone registers or uses the domain name with malicious intent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Article 9 also stipulates the malicious registration or use of domain names. For example, the purpose of registering or transferring a domain name is to sell, lease or otherwise transfer the domain name to the complainant or its competitor who is the owner of the civil rights and interests in order to obtain improper benefits; repeatedly use the name of another person who has legitimate rights and interests; or The logo is registered as its own domain name to prevent others from using the name or logo in which it has legitimate rights and interests in the form of a domain name on the Internet; the domain name is registered or transferred to damage the complainant&#39;s reputation, disrupt the complainant&#39;s normal business activities, or confuse the complainant. and the complainant, misleading the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, it should be pointed out that &quot;registering a domain name with the purpose of selling or leasing&quot; is no longer a criterion for judging malicious intent. For example, it is legal to register an Apple domain name first, and it is legal to sell it to Apple, but it cannot be sold to Apple&#39;s competitors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti ; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 14 Sep 2023 16:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[《过往人生》：所有分手，皆是前世]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256621]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-14 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/13/QGTof9q2QyCrgQnIXw8Jz9Wl3BVjA3xhFWCTzZEO.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;580&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/QGTof9q2QyCrgQnIXw8Jz9Wl3BVjA3 xhFWCTzZEO. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250685&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The English title of the movie &quot;Past Lives&quot; (&lt;em>;Past Lives&lt;/em>;) is a pun, which is both past life and plural. previous life. This shortlisted film for the main competition of the 2023 Berlin Film Festival has recently been praised by many audiences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Nora reunited with Haisheng, a boy who had first fallen in love at the age of 12, after 24 years of separation, she had already changed her English name. On Nora&#39;s left hand side, her husband, American Jewish writer Arthur, sat, speaking English to him; on Nora&#39;s right hand side, Hae Sung, who had miraculously transformed from a child into a mature man, spoke Korean to him. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nora and Haisheng discussed that the reason why they can sit here is because they were full of bonds in their previous lives. In those previous lives, they were either a princess secretly in love with her servant, or two people who did not love each other and betrayed each other due to family marriage, or they just happened to be seated next to each other on the train, or they were a bird and the person who carried it. Early morning tree branches. When they parted, they said that this moment might also be the past life. Because the past life is not only the talk of karma in Buddhism, but also a parallel time and space of imaginary, regretful, and missed possibilities. Since their relationship in this life is still full of shortcomings, then think of it as a vague past life, think of it as something that has happened and been written, not something that is being created, think of it as a dream, and not something that is being created. Not vividly.他们的来世将会怎样？没有人知道答案。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;三段前世或平行时空&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在日本作家三岛由纪夫的遗作、系列长篇小说《丰饶之海》四部曲里，前世、今生、来世的轮回，以既离奇又合理的方式徐徐展开，那是与西方迥然有别的时间观，一切悲剧，总能被绵绵无绝期的或然的世界抚慰。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;影片中，12岁，在首尔，诺拉还叫文娜英，父亲是导演，母亲是艺术家，是韩国的文化精英和中产阶级，决定举家移民加拿大。海盛是娜英的小学同班，因为娜英总是考第一，有次海盛考了第一，娜英就变成爱哭鬼。同学问她为什么要移民，她说因为韩国人拿不到诺贝尔文学奖。娜英在海盛的胳膊上，用彩笔画上一只鸟。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;24岁，诺拉偶然在父亲的脸书主页上发现一个寻找她的帖子，海盛一直在网上寻找娜英，但她早已改名Nora Moon。两人发信息联系，拨通视频电话，重新相互crush，怦然心动。有段时间，他们的关系像异国网恋，诺拉为了适应海盛的时区，改变作息早起跟他通话，海盛在南山坐缆车时，也要给诺拉打视频，从空中给她看首尔的风景。但空中的信号不稳定，断线之后，诺拉的表情仿佛在担心海盛出现意外，网络的阿拉丁神灯收回了对她的许诺，海盛被囚禁在屏幕的黑暗中。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;海盛对诺拉说，你的韩语真烂，她说，我只对妈妈和你两个人讲韩语。网恋总有奔现的一天，诺拉希望海盛来纽约，这里有她戏剧和写作的梦想，但她现在想拿的不是诺贝尔文学奖，而是普利策。海盛要去中国交换，他一直想学中文，因为以后用处多。两人的距离只是茫茫太平洋吗？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;36岁，海盛借口来纽约旅行，其实是专程看望诺拉。诺拉已经与亚瑟结婚七年。与海盛相比，亚瑟长相平平，习惯穿破旧的牛仔裤和棕色夹克，他是个作家，当然不会像游客一样，坐游艇去看自由女神像这样的明信片景观，但得知诺拉陪海盛去过这个旅行项目，又有些隐隐的失落。他跟诺拉在创意写作的驻地认识，为了诺拉的绿卡结婚。亚瑟问诺拉，我们的故事是不是太平淡了点？你在梦里只说韩语，那是一个我无法了解的世界。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;诺拉最终送海盛来到等车的街边，两人隔着一米，沉默了两分钟，好像这一米才是太平洋。两分钟里，他们没有接吻，没有依依不舍的缱绻，没有告白，他们从未成为真正的恋人，直到车来了，才有了一个犹豫再三的礼节性拥抱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这两分钟的沉默为什么是感人的，可能没人比美国作家塞林格说得更好：“有人认为爱是性，是婚姻，是清晨六点的吻，是一堆孩子，也许真是这样的，莱斯特小姐。但你知道我怎么想吗？我觉得爱是想触碰又收回手。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;没有乐土，没有人间天堂&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;《过往人生》的导演席琳·宋（Celine Song）对塞林格一定并不陌生。她是一个作家，加拿大籍韩裔，二十多岁来到纽约做戏剧，根据相似的经历写出了这个故事。几年前，在纽约东村的酒吧，一边坐着美国丈夫，一边坐着童年玩伴，她不停为两人进行翻译。宋感到周围的眼睛打量着这个奇怪的三人组合，于是有了影片开头画外音的议论。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;宋喜欢浪漫剧，她觉得，驱动罗曼蒂克戏剧的，往往是表现得像小孩一样的成年人，她希望角色在每个人袒露对彼此的感受时，展示出爱情是什么样子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;诺拉的饰演者、韩裔美国女演员格雷塔·李读到这个电影剧本时，忍不住抽泣，不得不边哭边艰难地继续读下去。虽然格雷塔·李是个在美国出生的移民二代，但她显然能体会到亚裔在北美的双重困境。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;诺拉对亚瑟说，在纽约，她认识很多韩裔美国人，但海盛跟他们不像，他是个地地道道的韩国人。然而跟海盛聊天时，她也变得更像韩国人了，诺拉问海盛为什么还不结婚，似乎完全丧失了纽约艺术家对多元文化和婚恋状态的包容，以保守的思维方式来询问同胞。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实上，海盛和诺拉人生选择的分歧，就是对韩国社会的一个隐喻：海盛学实用的工程学，来到与韩国有深厚历史渊源、经济前景广阔的中国交换；诺拉学文学和戏剧，想在全球性的文化中心纽约施展抱负。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当诺拉说移民的原因是“韩国人拿不到诺贝尔文学奖”时，这句颇有喜剧效果的台词，却道出了第三世界居民的一种普遍焦虑：一方面对诺贝尔文学奖代表的文学成就充满认同和钦羡，另一方面无意识地掉进了诺贝尔文学奖评选机制无可避免的西方中心主义陷阱。 “韩国人拿不到……”这一否定句式包含的自恨，背后是对落后地区的社会结构、文化制度、整体创造力的不信任。但当她脱离韩国、使用英语写作时，当她被识别为一个北美的亚裔，她便永远卡在了既非韩国作家也非美国作家的中间状态。因为合租省钱才跟亚瑟搬到一起住，因为移民政策才早早结婚，诺拉问，这真的是父母移民时，期待女儿过上的生活吗？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;豆瓣网友toska在短评中说：《过往人生》“让我感到最不适的是暗流的优越感”，纽约优于多伦多，多伦多优于首尔，她自己优于或等于美国韩裔，美国韩裔优于韩国人（电影里用的一个词是Korean Koreans，前一个词是文化意义上的韩国人，后一个词是族群意义上的韩国人），“可怕的是我觉得创作者本身是不自知的，却觉得自己委屈。在缺乏自我反思的前提下高歌自身贫瘠的体验和感受”。这或许提供了思考这部影片的另一个角度。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;今年釜山国际电影节的开幕影片《我讨厌韩国》根据小说《走出韩国》改编，主人公桂娜是一个学历、工作、容貌都平平的人，未来的一切都已注定，没有奇迹发生，她说：“韩国爱的人是它自己，而不是我。它只爱让它发光的那些人……而对于那些让它蒙羞的人，它都是避之不及的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同样的离散主题，《走出韩国》的主人公是为了逃离内卷和阶层固化，《过往人生》的诺拉是期待登上世界的舞台，留在韩国的海盛则想成为“更优秀”的人，即便身体辛苦，精神也不肯认输。真正的问题是，不论在哪片土地，都不能期待一个人间天堂，没有一劳永逸的乐土，只有永恒的困境。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;海盛问诺拉，假如你12岁时没有出国，假如我24岁时来到了纽约，会有什么不同？也许，正因为他们24年来只有两度惊鸿一瞥，没有陷入生活的琐屑、放大彼此的缺点，这缺憾才完美而迷人，值得诺拉失声痛哭，一边是不完美的祖国的完美的初恋，一边是完美的乌托邦的不完美的日常，她徘徊在曼哈顿的街区，也徘徊于无地。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 14 Sep 2023 15:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
