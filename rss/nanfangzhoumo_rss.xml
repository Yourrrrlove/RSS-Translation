A physical education teacher who works in a primary school in Guangzhou expressed his difficulties to me. He works diligently and conscientiously. More than 20 years have passed, but he still cannot be awarded a senior professional title because he has no skills in paper writing and has never published a scientific research paper. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The experience of fellow students is not unique. Many primary and secondary school teachers, especially older teachers, were turned away during the professional title review process because they did not complete the basic requirements for writing scientific research papers, regardless of their teaching years. How long it has been, how rich the teaching experience is, and how many outstanding students it has trained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A journal editor friend of mine told me that her professional title evaluation was based on the editing sequence, but the evaluation indicators were basically the same as those of scientific researchers. In other words, the relevant parties&#39; performance evaluation is based on the same as that of a full-time scientific researcher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar to the experiences of teachers, there are doctors and people in other fields. For example, doctors also have basic requirements for scientific research papers or scientific research projects during the professional title evaluation process. They are busy treating diseases and saving people, and have no time to write papers, or are unable to complete papers. When the time comes for professional title evaluation, they are often at a loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An agricultural expert may have rich practical experience in agriculture. After years of exploration and practice, he and his team have cultivated improved seeds, greatly increased grain output, and significantly increased grain productivity. He has trained many outstanding talents, but perhaps he still has an intermediate professional title simply because he is old and does not have or is not good at writing and publishing papers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, writing papers and applying for projects have become prerequisites for the evaluation of professional titles for most professional and technical personnel. Without a paper of a certain weight and a project of a certain level, you cannot be promoted to a professional title. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are several basic problems here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, papers and projects have become the most important factors in the assessment and evaluation mechanism of practitioners in many industries. Is this reasonable? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Common sense tells us that a teacher’s primary duty is to teach and educate people so that students can grow and thrive healthily; a doctor’s primary duty is to treat illnesses and save lives, and relieve patients from their illnesses. Compared with publishing papers or applying for projects, teaching or saving people are the most important things for teachers or doctors. It is really difficult and unnecessary to ask every teacher to be good at doing scientific research and writing papers, to ask every doctor to be good at doing scientific research and writing papers, and to ask every agricultural expert to write papers and submit projects. In other words, if you put the importance of writing papers and applying for projects above teaching, saving people, and taking root in the field, you are literally putting the cart before the horse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, since papers and topics should not be the most important indicators, why are they most frequently adopted in various personnel assessment and evaluation mechanisms? This is mainly due to the advantages of quantification. Generally speaking, for the assessment of a person, quantitative indicators are generally better than qualitative indicators. The former can eliminate subjective factors such as favors or relationships to a certain extent, that is, by counting the number of published papers, the level of journals, the level of applied topics and Funding is used to determine a person&#39;s professional level. As the main basis for professional title evaluation, it is relatively fair and fair, and it is relatively simple to operate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirdly, are published papers or successfully applied topics necessarily very good? Can it truly reflect the scientific research ability or professional level of the person concerned? Not really. Many teachers are busy with daily teaching, or are not familiar with the routine of writing papers due to their old age. Many doctors are busy with heavy work and have no time to write papers. What should I do? Some people can only temporarily hire gunmen to write their papers and buy space to publish them. There are even “paper processing factories” and “paper gunmen” emerging one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The result is that fake and shoddy papers are flying all over the place. Even if many papers are published, the authors themselves are too lazy to pay attention to them, and either shelve them or abandon them. Many papers are completed behind closed doors in the office, that is, mainly by purchasing data, constructing models, copying and pasting, and revising and revising. As for the relationship between the theoretical contribution of the paper and its practical value, and the relationship between the paper and one&#39;s own field of expertise, it is not important. What is important is that the article has been put into print. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the same way, the funds applied for for many projects are not small, ranging from several million to tens of millions, but they are of little help in solving major issues in China&#39;s comprehensive modernization process, and they are not very helpful in promoting this discipline. There are very few major theoretical innovation contributions in the field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fourth, what is a good paper or a good topic? Yu believes that a good topic or paper must originate from real production and life practices, must be combined with real production and life practices, and must undergo careful and rigorous exploration, investigation and research, or fill a certain research field. The blanks will either play a positive role in promoting human understanding and revealing the truth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course qualified teachers are encouraged to write papers, but the direct or main purpose of writing papers is to improve the quality of teaching, not to complete requirements, let alone write empty and irrelevant articles that have nothing to do with their own teaching. Boring garbage article. As a teacher, the topic or focus of the paper or topic should mainly focus on teaching, such as the discussion of teaching methods, the improvement of teaching forms, the summary of teaching experience, the design of teaching models, etc. As a doctor, the topic or focus of his paper or project should mainly originate from or be inspired by his own medical treatment process. The paper or project should be conducive to the fundamental alleviation or solution of a difficult and complicated disease and contribute to the practical improvement of medical treatment. It plays a practical role in improving patient treatment efficiency and fundamentally improving human health conditions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relevant parties need to re-examine and seriously reflect on the concrete meaning of the four words &quot;people-oriented&quot;: schools are places to cultivate talents, &quot;people-oriented&quot; should be student-oriented, and teachers&#39; primary responsibility is to make students healthy Growth and vigorous development; the hospital is a place where diseases are treated and patients are saved. &quot;Humanism&quot; is based on the patient, and the doctor&#39;s primary responsibility is to relieve the patient&#39;s pain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the assessment and evaluation of relevant practitioners, the overall principle is to allow most people to return to their main business or first business, give full play to their strengths, and fundamentally change or optimize the current KPI assessment system in all walks of life. inappropriate or unreasonable elements, moderately or significantly reduce the proportion of papers or topics; implement different assessment methods and details for different types of practitioners, including paper or topic assessments and practical ability assessments, rather than the current relative The prevailing one-way street of only essays or only topics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 19:25:08 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[《横琴方案》发布两周年，数读成绩单丨一图读懂]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256710]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-15 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;72646&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;69538&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/b21efb4423.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;Second Anniversary of the Hengqin Plan.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0 &quot; width=&quot;2000&quot; height=&quot;8301&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/b21efb4423.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250814&quot; style=&quot; &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[在“被强奸”漩涡中挣扎八天后，一位44岁农妇选择自杀]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256716]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-15 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The old house hidden under the trees, Yi Yonghong&#39;s self-report of being &quot;raped&quot; The place where the incident occurred.

I just hope that you can live a happy life and forget that I am a bad wife and mother. .&quot; She said in her suicide note. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To commit suicide, she chose a mile away. She had to pass through a large guava field. The unripe fruits wrapped in white plastic bags were hung all over the orchard. They were the fruits of her summer.番石榴树不高，穿行时得弯下腰，三五步就得跨过一道排水沟。最后一截路是一道约两米高的斜坡，攀上去，便是堤坝，水面宽阔的水塘就在眼前徐徐展开。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;堤坝上长满了含羞草，郁郁葱葱。那双粉红色拖鞋被义永红整齐地摆放在岸边台阶上，鞋尖朝着水塘方向。几个小时后，丈夫程善志发现了她，妻子身着红色上衣，以俯卧的姿势漂在水塘中央。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;自杀8天前，在44岁的年纪，她报案称被水果商贩黄某冠强奸，警方因现有证据不能证实有犯罪事实发生，决定不予立案。自杀后，9月7日警方以“发现新的证据”为由决定立案侦查，为了证明被强奸，保存在冰棺中的她被开颅剖胸验尸。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;芭蕉地里的厄运&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;台风“泰利”正在逼近。在狂风暴雨抵达前，义永红要砍完家里二十多亩芭蕉。 9年前，这对来自湖南永州的夫妻在海南文昌包地种水果，如今承包地有近50亩的规模，一半种芭蕉，另一半种番石榴。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;义永红微信聊天记录显示，7月14日晚，她与黄某冠敲定了第二天收芭蕉的时间。黄某冠在文昌最热闹的公园附近开了一家水果批发档口，会去果农家上门收购。在文昌一带，种水果的多是渡过琼州海峡前来讨生活的外地人，水果商贩则多是海南当地人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;义永红很少抛头露面卖芭蕉，多数时间只管在蕉田里埋头干活。 2023年初，义永红丈夫程善志经老乡介绍，才与黄某冠有生意往来，至事发总共卖给他五次芭蕉，交易额为1480元。前两次都是程善志砍下芭蕉与黄某冠交易，因丈夫左脚脚踝意外割伤严重，义永红接下了后三次砍芭蕉的活儿。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;正是这三次独自卖芭蕉的经历，将义永红的人生推向了万劫不复的境地。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;义永红夫妻俩承包的芭蕉地离她租住的村子有段不近的距离，骑电瓶车需半个小时。 2014年，他们用空心砖在芭蕉地旁建了一栋容身的房子，方圆两百米内没有别的人家。 2022年搬走时，那里只剩下一条看家的狗，和几只散养的鸡。闲置的旧屋开始落灰、荒凉，厨房不再生火，床铺也不再睡人，除了干活时歇脚，义永红很少到这里来，密不透风的大树几乎要吞掉这座小房子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;案发现场的旧屋。南方周末记者陈佳慧摄&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/c5d8bd5bd3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;4032&quot; height=&quot;3024&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/c5d8bd5bd3.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;义永红后来告诉丈夫，那次，黄某冠趁着帮她把芭蕉扛上肩头的机会，摸了她的胸部。还对她说：“你不要干这么辛苦的工，我给钱给你用。”义永红拒绝了他：“你不要说这个话，我们是干苦命工，赚辛苦钱的，我不是那种人。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;发生在芭蕉地里的事情已无法获得更多佐证。黄某冠水果店旁的其他商户称，事发后，已经一个月多没见到他。 9月2日下午，黄的妻子在店铺旁支摊卖水果，她情绪激动，拒绝受访：“你都不知道他们给我们的生活造成多大的影响，我的压力很大。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一周之后，芭蕉又得采摘，义永红和黄某冠再次在植被疯长、荒无人烟的芭蕉地碰面。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种见面似乎难以避免：义永红选择隐忍，同时与他们合作的“芭蕉老板”只有三个，一个是年龄很大的老伯，走路有点颤巍，另一个老板不上门收购，最后一个就是黄某冠。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在妻子向程善志的讲述中，黄某冠再次有不轨行为，未遂后，黄某冠除了470元的芭蕉钱，还多给了义永红100元，“我老婆就丢回给他，没有要”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第三次是在台风抵达前两天。程善志称，7月15日，义永红按照约定的时间到了芭蕉地，挑选、砍背、过秤、装车。付完钱后，午后的大暴雨突然从天而降。义永红对车上装着雨棚的黄某冠说，自己没有雨衣，要等雨停再走，让他先走。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随后，义永红进屋，坐在那张近一年没睡过的床上避雨。在后来的报案中，义永红自述当时被强暴。事后，黄某冠丢下150元后就跑了。两天后，她告诉丈夫，那天她喝了黄某冠递来的蜂蜜菊花茶后，就有点不舒服，不知道是天气太热中暑还是菊花茶的缘故，头很晕。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;丈夫和女儿的追问&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;若不是被丈夫发现，义永红原本打算让这些事烂在肚子里。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“瞒下来”这个决定并不难做。在后来双方接触的现场录音中，义永红自述其担心，若把遭遇告诉丈夫，他一定会去报复对方，最终会害了两个孩子，“我只想保护这个家庭”。程善志补充，妻子还有其他考量，比如对方有钱有势，自己是漂泊不定的外来户；再比如，44岁被“强奸”，“不光彩哩”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;义永红一直掩饰被“强奸”的痕迹。黄某冠第一次强抱她上床，义永红挣脱逃走时，大腿内侧红了一片，丈夫问起时，她谎称是背芭蕉刮到的。事发后，义永红骑车回家的路上摔了三次，回家后程善志看她闷闷不乐，但没怎么摔伤，也就没放在心上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;可在事发当天晚上，义永红让丈夫去女儿的空房间睡，让程善志感到不对劲。结婚23年，他们很少分床睡。后来，义永红跟丈夫解释，之所以分房是不知道黄某冠有没有病，怕传染给他。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不管妻子多想隐瞒，满心疑虑的程善志，还是在第二天发现了端倪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;像往常一样，程善志每天早上都要骑车去芭蕉地喂那条看家的狗。他打开房门后发现，床上的枕头被动过，很久没人用过的一大卷纸巾也只剩下一小卷。程善志“一下就怀疑可能发生这个事情了”。他菜都没买，赶紧往三排坡村的家里赶，质问妻子昨天到底发生了什么事，得到的答案却是“没有发生什么事”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;程善志觉得那卷纸巾少得蹊跷，他联想到自己和妻子性生活后会使用纸巾擦拭，于是他继续逼问。直到深夜，追问依旧无果后，他给在海口打暑假工的女儿打去电话，期望女儿能问出什么。起初，22岁的女儿程海燕并不相信父亲说的，但在电话里感觉他很生气，她还是给妈妈打去电话，问“有没有被人家欺负”“有没有跟人家那个啥”。义永红在电话里长久地沉默、哭泣，在两个问题轮着问了几遍之后，义永红最终松了口。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;义永红女儿回到自家的蕉田。南方周末记者陈佳慧摄&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/4e271c4134.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;4032&quot; height=&quot;3024&quot;

&lt;p>;听完妻子的讲述，程善志很生气，他气老婆为什么不告诉他，如果第一次、第二次就告诉他，根本就不会有后面的事发生。他也想不明白，为什么这种事情能发生在他身上。 “如果你告诉我了，你的身体就不会被人家得到，最伤痛我心的就在这个地方。我觉得我老婆一辈子都是我的人，不可能跟别人分享的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;妻子多次瞒着不说，也让程善志忍不住怀疑，她到底是被“强奸”还是出轨。那晚，从来没对妻子动过手的程善志打了一下义永红的小臂。 “我这辈子还对不起你吗？什么事都依着你，钱都是你管着，还要我怎么对你？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我知道发生这样的事谁都会不相信，不理解，我也百口莫辩。”义永红在遗书里说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;和解与报警&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;7月17日，台风“泰利”越来越近，越来越强，一场暴风雨已迫在眉睫。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这天上午，程善志打电话给黄某冠，让他到自己家来。他想跟对方当面对质，也想报复对方。快中午时，黄某冠拎着一箱王老吉上了门。程善志将一把长十几厘米的弹簧刀打开，藏在裤子口袋。义永红发现后一把将他抱住，让他不要做傻事。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是三人第一次同时在场，也是最后一次。南方周末记者从当时现场录音听到，与其说这是一场两方的对峙，不如说三个人各有心事。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;程善志没有原谅妻子，似在赌气地对妻子说：“你跟他好就好，不好是你们自己的事。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;义永红时而声嘶力竭，斥责黄某冠：“现在我自身难保。我还以为你是很正经的人。我就问你，你为什么要搞我，你干嘛不去搞人家。”时而毫无气力，自怨自艾：“反正都是我下贱，我死了也没事。我现在什么都没有了，不知道要去哪。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;原本应是矛头所向的犯罪嫌疑人，黄某冠却像是“和事佬”，一边劝两人好好过，一边同意和解方案，对程善志说：“我给你一万块钱，我们两清啦，就什么都没有发生过了，都是好兄弟。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;程善志称，黄某冠当场写下一张字条：“本人与义永红发生性关系，现赔偿义永红老公精神损失费一万块钱。”并署名黄某冠。他拿出6000元现金，另微信转账4000元。但程善志没有收下这笔钱，他听从女儿的建议，报了警，并把那张字条交给了警方。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;程海燕通过电话，旁听了这场和解。她并不赞成这个和解方案，除了有对方反告敲诈勒索的风险外，她还想让黄某冠给母亲道歉，更想让他坐牢。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;7月17日，黄某冠上门和解时拎的王老吉至今仍在义永红家里。南方周末记者陈佳慧摄&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/68115a27c2.jpg&quot;

text-align: center;&quot;>;7月17日，黄某冠上门和解时拎的王老吉至今仍在义永红家里。 （南方周末记者陈佳慧/摄）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，事后回想，程海燕总觉得让爸爸报警有点过激了，“（一家人）没有沟通好，一下就报警了”。实际上，在黄某冠上门和解的前一晚，程海燕就提出报警，但义永红一直哭着说没有证据，对方也不会承认。程海燕认为，哪怕最后告不赢，也想让黄某冠道歉来恢复母亲的名誉。 “对方一直想用钱来摆平。我觉得我们就算再穷，也不能让你这样欺负我们。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;程海燕尝试给黄某冠打电话“取证”，但每次一说到关键问题，对方就说“不要扯这个”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很难说清，与被“强奸”相比，公之于众的报警是不是更让义永红难以接受。 7月17日晚，台风“泰利”登陆文昌，暴雨如注，狂风肆虐芭蕉。此时，义永红、程善志、黄某冠正在派出所接受问询。程善志听到，义永红一直在哭。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;让夫妻俩意外的是，报警的第二天，即7月18日下午，黄某冠妻子、儿子、女儿、姐姐、姐夫一行五人找到家里，目的仍是和解。黄某冠口中的“律师”女儿对义永红说，不和解的话，以后传出去很难听，而且对正在上学的女儿影响也不好。程海燕不知道她还跟母亲说了什么，让义永红觉得女儿并不懂法，她拨通女儿电话：“你到底懂不懂法哩？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;程善志拍板拒绝和解后，对方的态度开始转变。程善志说，黄的妻子威胁他们，同时羞辱义永红，“要把老公让给她”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;嚎啕大哭的崩溃&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;从事发到两次和解不成，再到报警被问询，义永红正被一点点推向悬崖边缘。程海燕坦言，当时家人没有太多照顾到她的情绪，也忽略了她更需要的理解和陪伴。但对那时的程海燕来说，母亲的表现“一切都很平常”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;义永红的崩溃或是从一场歇斯底里的大哭开始。 7月19日早上5点多，程海燕被妈妈的哭声吓醒。妈妈此前也哭过，都是躺在床上盖着被子默默流泪，像这样坐在床边撕心裂肺地哭，程海燕第一次见。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;程善志站在门口，他不知道该怎么办。程海燕站在妈妈的床边，同样不知所措，她害怕，不知道该怎么去表达关心，也不知道怎么去抚慰她。甚至，她无法体会母亲此刻的痛苦。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她自认是一个情感粗糙的女儿，因为在这个家族，他们被灌输女儿只能靠自己，儿子就是靠父母的观念，“我外婆那一辈，会把女儿看得比较轻，不会把太多的情感给予女儿”。义永红被教育女孩读书没用，因此初二没读完她就辍学了。那时义永红成绩不错，考试成绩班级前三，还被舞蹈学校选中，但外公不愿花钱供她。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;义永红一家的合照。南方周末记者陈佳慧摄&quot;

data-key=&quot;250826&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;义永红一家的合照。 （南方周末记者陈佳慧/摄）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;到了程海燕这一辈，她仍被如此对待。小时候，义永红常对她说，姐姐一定要让着弟弟，弟弟的衣服必须由姐姐洗，夫妻俩偏爱儿子的情感在2015年儿子确诊急性白血病后达到峰值。为了不给父母添负担，程海燕自己赚取生活费，她做过服务员、洗碗工、前台收银等，“吃苦多了，觉得麻木了”。近几年，程海燕很少陪父母过年，都在外面打工赚钱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;义永红的嚎啕大哭没有减弱，她嘴里反复说着“这句话说得对不对”，程海燕不知道“这句话”是什么话。她拨通了大舅的电话，这是她能想到的安慰妈妈的最合适人选。外婆年龄大了，受不了刺激；患病的弟弟正在外地实习，是全家隐瞒的重点对象；而大姨、小舅与母亲关系不好，经常吵架。能支撑义永红的人几乎没有。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;实际上，义永红自尊心很强，并不愿意让家里人知道她的事。 “我们很少找亲戚帮忙，也很少给亲戚打电话诉苦。我妈妈觉得，人家会取笑你，不会想要帮助你。”程海燕说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;远在东莞的大舅接通了程海燕的电话，“他喊了两声我妈妈的名字，&#39;红红，红红&#39;，她一下子就收住情绪了”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;程海燕不知道为什么家里的顶梁柱突然间就垮了，弟弟生病化疗时她都挺了过来。程善志也想不明白妻子为何过不了这个坎：“我没有提离婚，也没赶你走，作为老公，我还是疼你的，为什么就想不开呢？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;程善志很满意自己的妻子，她漂亮，皮肤白，从不化妆，说话温柔，第一次带回老家时，村里人都夸他“你们家这祖坟好啊”。 “这种老婆还有什么讲的，根本没有嫌弃的地方。”程善志经常教育女儿，以后要向妈妈学习，对老公要好。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;义永红是个传统且保守的农村女人，连恋爱也是问清了程善志的属相生日后才在一起。婚后，除了干农活，义永红自然地揽下了洗衣做饭的家务，每天都给丈夫按脚，隔段时间还给他修剪指甲，吃完饭会坐在旁边陪着，丈夫喝完酒就去帮他盛饭。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;家人的记忆里，义永红很少与异性打交道或是开玩笑，买卫生巾时总会躲躲藏藏，一定要用黑色塑料袋装。洗好的内衣也总是夹在其他衣服中间晾。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;义永红没什么朋友，消遣的方式是喝茶、打麻将以及刷抖音。偶尔她也自己拍抖音，套上滤镜开到最大的花哨模板，她表情严肃盯着镜头。她有时感叹生活辛苦，有时配上歌曲“嫁出去的姑娘，泼出去的水，回到娘家你别多嘴”“人这一辈子，咋就这么难”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从2000年跟随丈夫到海南打拼，他们种过香茅，养过蛇，好不容易攒下钱想在老家盖房子，儿子却确诊急性淋巴细胞白血病。因长期劳作，义永红双手骨节变形，无法伸直。她常对女儿说，跟了你爸，老家没有房子，海南也没有房子，哪都没有家。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;母亲死后，程海燕总是梦到她，但总也看不到她的脸，程海燕猜想，可能是母亲“不愿意见我们，是我们让她失望了”。义永红留下的遗书，程海燕也不敢看第二遍。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;被质疑的反抗&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;让义永红承受巨大压力的另一重要原因，是她始终认为证据不够。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事发当天，义永红为瞒下这件事，她洗了澡，也洗了当天穿的衣服，用过的纸巾也被她扔在屋外的树下，已被大雨冲烂。 “我恨我自己，不懂得用法律来保护自己……把罪证也弄没有了，我害怕告不赢他。”她在遗书中这样陈述。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另一件让义永红倍感绝望的事，是事发过程中，她不清楚自己的行为算不算反抗。在遗书中，她称：“如果反抗要像你们说的抓伤，抓扯衣服烂，这些没有。因为我害怕他打我，弄我的家人。我的口供上只说推他，说不要搞，这算不算反抗。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;程善志像是在宽慰死去的妻子，他说黄某冠比自己高出一个头，胳膊有自己的两个粗，身材魁梧高大。 “如果他两只手抱着你，你有力气反抗吗？不管我老婆有没有反抗，是你这个男的主动侵害我老婆，不是我老婆去侵害你的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;程海燕也不知道什么叫反抗，在她看来，推开对方也属于反抗。她平常很少关注女性权益保护类的新闻，在母亲自杀后，朋友推荐程海燕看了电视剧《不完美受害人》：“女主在精神压迫下，也不知道该怎么去反抗。我觉得我妈妈在精神上是有反抗的，如果没有反抗，她不会有哭这种行为。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于反抗，66岁的村小组组长韩杭元有自己的看法。他认为，要在对方身体留下一个记号，哪怕有刀架在女方的脖子上，也要反抗。义永红自杀后，这个只有13户人家的小村庄，义永红以前常去的茶馆里流传着另一个故事版本：两人是偷情，被丈夫发现后自杀。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;让案件变得复杂的另一要素，是黄某冠走时扔下的150元。在义永红自杀后的一次双方对质中，黄的妻子认为，给了150元，这件事的性质就变了，成了“买卖”。在义永红自杀后，那两张脏脏的、黑黑的纸币被揉得皱巴巴，叠放在义永红的腰包里。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;程善志感觉妻子被他们用钱侮辱了，“他（黄某冠）丢了钱就跑，我老婆肯定要捡起来了”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;7月21日，事发后第六天，程善志和义永红再次被叫去录口供，这也是事发后他们第二次录口供。正是录完这个口供，义永红写下了那封遗书。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;程海燕记得，母亲录完口供回家后，她给妈妈打了一个电话，她问：“你愿不愿意告？要是愿意告，我只能尽力去帮你。要是不愿意告，就不告了。”程海燕后知后觉，“（之前是）我们想让她去告，而不是她想自己去告。主动和被推动不是一个事儿。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;义永红选择了告。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在义永红的遭遇被媒体报道后，8月26日，文昌市公安局称已抽调精干警力成立联合调查组，开展全面复查。据程海燕统计，义永红自杀之后，警方重新搜集的证据有：20瓶蜂蜜菊花茶（2瓶未拆封，18瓶空盒），义永红的手机，150元纸币，义永红妇科检查病历，事发后义永红第二天穿的内裤，床单，被罩，席子，枕头，胸罩，长裤，外衣，被雨冲烂的纸巾，以及义永红尸检取得的血液、肝和脾。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于黄某冠是否被刑拘，立案的新证据又是什么，文昌市公安局政工室一名工作人员告诉南方周末记者：“案件正在侦办中，不方便透露。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;义永红生前所住房子的卧室，遗书曾放在那张红色的凳子上。南方周末记者陈佳慧摄&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/3e56ff08d4.jpg&quot;

text-align: center;&quot;>;义永红生前所住房子的卧室，遗书曾放在那张红色的凳子上。 （南方周末记者陈佳慧/摄）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在程善志看来，即使在义永红偷偷写下遗书那天，他也没有觉察妻子有任何异常。 7月22日，干了一天活后，夫妻俩决定到饭店吃晚饭。程善志给妻子买了四罐红牛，义永红爱喝红牛，事发前几乎每天都要喝一罐。程善志躺在躺椅上等她，冲好澡的义永红抱着丈夫，吻了他。那顿晚餐他们点了一份白斩鸡，还有一盘地瓜叶。义永红依旧没有胃口，连最爱的红牛也没喝，只吃了一点地瓜叶。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;7月23日，是程海燕从海口回文昌录口供的日子。一早，程善志叫她：“红，我们一起去陪女儿录口供，两个人有个伴。”一连叫了三次，义永红都拒绝了，“她说，你去吧，我在家等你回来，我很累，想在家休息一下。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;搁在平常，程善志会去拉一下她，夫妻俩出行总是形影不离。但那天，“我就忘记拉她一把”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 17:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[汕尾如何“握手”高铁经济时代：拥抱文旅融合发展]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256658]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-15 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;The Guangzhou-Shantou High-speed Railway will be officially opened in late September.

Commercial banks&#39; reliance on card quantity has been replaced by quality and efficiency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Overall Operation of the Payment System in the Fourth Quarter of 2022&quot; released by the People&#39;s Bank of China shows that as of the end of 2022, the number of credit cards and debit and credit cards in use totaled 798 million, a year-on-year decrease of 0.28%. This is the first negative growth in credit card issuance in China since records began. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, as the core high-quality business segment of commercial banks, in the era of digital finance, the credit card business is facing a new competitive situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, which card issuing bank will still have outstanding scale and growth rate? Which card issuing bank has better risk management system and risk control effect? Which card issuer is better at retaining customers? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center adopted a combination of quantitative and qualitative research and analysis methods to construct a comprehensive evaluation index system including 16 indicators in three major dimensions, and differentiated the indicators based on their importance. Empowerment. This enables commercial banks of different sizes and types to achieve &quot;horizontally comparable and vertical ranking&quot; in terms of their overall strength in credit card business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under this indicator system, researchers from Southern Weekend New Financial Center objectively evaluated the performance of 19 major commercial banks in their credit card business based on their 2022 annual report data and third-party evaluation data, and The &quot;Credit Card Quality and Efficiency List&quot; is released based on the evaluation score results. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Indicator system&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;:&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Three dimensions&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Sixteen&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;sub-indicators&lt; /strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Since the birth of China&#39;s first standard credit card in 1995, the &quot;imported product&quot; of credit card has become one of the basic tools of personal credit business of various financial institutions after nearly 30 years of hard work. At the end of 2022, the credit card loan balance of 18 major commercial banks was 7.89 trillion (Ningbo Bank&#39;s credit card loan balance data has not been disclosed, so it is not included in the statistics), accounting for 14.4% of the personal loan balance, becoming the second largest personal loan after housing mortgage loans. credit markets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is the important value of credit card business to commercial banks? First of all, the credit card business is an important support for the bank’s retail business; secondly, the credit card business helps banks improve customer loyalty and stickiness; thirdly, the credit card business provides banks with consumer-related data, and banks can better complete portraits of their customers and consumers. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the development trend characteristics of the credit card business of various commercial banks and the credit card customer satisfaction survey, Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center constructed the &quot;Credit Card Quality and Efficiency Ranking&quot; evaluation index system &lt;em>;,&lt;/em>; which It includes three major dimensions: business scale and growth, risk management, customer service and product innovation, and is refined into fifteen quantitative indicators and one qualitative indicator. The evaluation index system is now described in detail as follows:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/rB3LjY143PkCBOLBGAvB6nIqPDnWobGzOmO0ep0Z.jpg&quot; border= &quot;0&quot; width=&quot;498&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/rB3LjY143PkCBOLBGAvB6nIqPDnWobGzOmO0ep0Z.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250761 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;(1) Business scale and growth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Credit cards are an important tool for banks to establish long-term relationships with customers, and are also the focus of banks’ retail business. The scale and growth of the credit card business reflect the bank&#39;s customer acquisition capabilities and market position, while the number of credit card issuances and changes in the issuance volume reflect the bank&#39;s expansion effect, and the loan balance and proportion reflect the actual contribution of the bank&#39;s credit cards, the number of active accounts and transactions The amount reflects the marketing accuracy and stickiness of bank credit cards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;(2) Risk management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is very necessary to examine the risk management capabilities of bank credit cards. Credit cards are &quot;unsecured revolving loans&quot; issued by banks based on their trust in cardholders. The risk management capabilities of credit card business affect the bank&#39;s operating efficiency and competitiveness. Credit cards are an important source of income for banks, and their revenue comes from interest, fees and annual fees. If indicators such as the bad debt rate, fraud rate, and theft rate of credit cards cannot be effectively controlled, the bank&#39;s costs will increase and its profits will decrease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Affected by the epidemic, the non-performing loan ratio of commercial banks (including the non-performing ratio of credit card loans) will increase in 2022. At the same time, the measures to improve non-performing loan ratios disclosed in the annual reports of most listed banks are relatively general, and the measures taken by various banks lack comparability. In order to highlight the efforts and effects of banks in controlling the non-performing loan ratio, this evaluation system uses the credit card loan non-performing ratio indicator in 2022 and also sets a change rate indicator for the credit card loan non-performing ratio to directly reflect the achievements of the measures taken by each bank. Effectiveness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;(3) Customer service and product innovation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Competition in the credit card market is becoming increasingly fierce, and banks are constantly launching new products, services, functions and activities to meet the diverse needs of customers and improve customer stickiness. This evaluation system evaluates from both the bank side and the consumer side. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We use the types of credit cards issued by banks and the number of complaints about credit card business as positive and negative indicators respectively. On the consumer side, evaluations from third-party organizations are used, because third-party organizations obtain consumers’ evaluations of credit card products through a large number of objective questionnaires, which are more objective than those disclosed in bank annual reports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We select China Customer Satisfaction Index (C-CSI) and China Net Promoter Score (C-NPS) as consumers’ evaluation of credit card products. index. C-CSI and C-NPS survey targets permanent residents between the ages of 15 and 60, and are randomly sampled according to gender, age, income and region, and completed through household interviews. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We consider the card issuer’s distinctive credit card services of the year as bonus points. Each unique credit card service that is publicly disclosed and can be collected will receive 10 points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;(4) Reward and punishment mechanism for information disclosure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In our research, we found that most banks have disclosed data on each of the above indicators, but a few banks have not disclosed one or more indicators. In order to reduce the impact of information asymmetry and punish banks that do not disclose sufficient information, this evaluation system will give the lowest score to any indicator item that does not disclose relevant data. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;China Merchants Bank takes the lead&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Hua Xia is only better than city commercial banks&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;We will 19 The credit card businesses of commercial banks are ranked according to their scores, and the &quot;Credit Card Quality and Efficiency List&quot; is selected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Credit Card Quality and Efficiency Ranking&quot; shows that national commercial banks that started their credit card business earlier and have a large customer base rank high. But it does not mean that the larger the card issuance volume, the higher the overall score. As a joint-stock bank, although China Merchants Bank is not as large as the state-owned banks, it ranks first in the overall score of credit card business. This is due to its strategic vision of taking the lead in developing retail business and its innovation power that has been sustained for many years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/nrq2m73w7NwpA0YngHO0HozRPlvgzwOnrwyzdfu2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;864&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/nrq2m73w7NwpA0YngHO0HozRPlvgzwOnrwyzdfu2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250762&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Building Bank of China and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China closely followed China Merchants Bank in second and third place respectively. Among them, the total score of China Construction Bank&#39;s credit cards is only 20 points less than that of China Merchants Bank, with a very small gap. Three banks form the leading phalanx in the credit card business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the six major state-owned banks, the total score of Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China is far outside the top five. Not only are they far behind China Merchants Bank, but they are also surpassed by joint-stock banks such as CITIC, Ping An and China Guangdong Development Bank. Postal Savings Bank ranked thirteenth. Among joint-stock banks, Hua Xia Bank is at the bottom, with a score difference of 248 points from China Merchants Bank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/XPGZaas4gffibT9dkNVoXQWhd7gVkP1r0UbYHUiZ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;864&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/XPGZaas4gffibT9dkNVoXQWhd7gVkP1r0UbYHUiZ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250763&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Industrial and commercial The main reason why banks lose points with credit cards is that they only publish the total complaints but not the complaints of the credit card business. Therefore, when we do not consider the indicator of credit card business complaints, China Merchants Bank still leads the list, and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China overtook China Construction Bank and rose to second place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similarly, if the number of complaints is not taken into account, China Guangdong Development Bank and Bank of Communications leap to fourth and fifth place. This shows that the number of complaints from these two banks is relatively large. Of course, this does not rule out malicious complaints from gray products. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;State-owned banks and joint-stock banks are seriously divided&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;City commercial banks are catching up&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p >; Regardless of state-owned banks or joint-stock banks, the credit card scores of the two echelons are seriously divided in their respective camps. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the six major state-owned banks, only two and three are among the top five in the two lists, namely China Construction Bank, ICBC, China Construction Bank, ICBC and Bank of Communications. Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of China ranked low in both lists. Especially in the list excluding the number of complaints, Bank of China’s score has reached fourteenth place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among joint-stock banks, China Merchants Bank has always been far ahead. The overall performance of CITIC, Ping An and GF is remarkable. Among them, China CITIC Bank’s total credit card score is second only to China Merchants Bank among joint-stock banks. This is mainly due to the fact that the bank has received more scores than its peers in terms of consumer services and credit card business complaints. Among them, the score for credit card complaints is higher than that of other companies on the list. Bank and credit card categories also scored over 80, indicating that they cover a wide range of consumer groups. Although Guangdong Development Bank is smaller among all joint-stock banks, the overall score of Guangfa Credit Card is high among all banks. This reflects the important position of China Guangdong Development Bank&#39;s credit card business in the bank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The credit card scores of the four city commercial banks are at the bottom of the list, which shows that they still have a clear gap with large and medium-sized banks in terms of comprehensive credit card strength. Affected by factors such as their short time in the credit card market, small business scale and weak customer base, city commercial banks as a whole lag behind in indicators such as credit card issuance volume and credit card loan balance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, among city commercial banks, Bank of Jiangsu and Bank of Ningbo both scored 100 points for the credit card change volume indicator, especially Bank of Ningbo, which scored as high as 90 points for the proportion of complaints in the credit card business. This reflects that leading city commercial banks are working hard to catch up in the credit card business and have made great progress in some indicators. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（助理研究员梁承昊邹欢杨超群亦有贡献）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[父亲殴打猥亵女儿者，检察机关不予起诉：义愤彰显人性，震慑奸宄之徒丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256739]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-15 14:09:23&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A few days ago, a case published by the &quot;Procuratorial Daily&quot; made many netizens shout &quot;Yangjian News&quot; and &quot;very mentioning&quot; gas&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 9, 2021, Li learned that his 15-year-old daughter had been molested by Xie Moumou, the deputy dean of a certain vocational and technical college, and came to the school to beat Xie Moumou. Xie&#39;s injury was assessed as minor injury level two. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The procuratorial organ believed that although Li&#39;s act of injuring Xie was suspected of intentional injury, it was an act of injury carried out out of anger in the process of claiming his daughter&#39;s legitimate rights and interests from the school. Because Li was a first-time offender and an occasional offender, his behavior was justified and the circumstances were minor, and he had lenient and lenient punishment circumstances such as surrendering, so the decision was made not to prosecute. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for Xie Moumou, after the procuratorate initiated a public prosecution, the court sentenced him to two years and two months in prison for the crime of forced indecency, prohibiting him from engaging in sexual relations with minors from the date of completion of the sentence or the date of parole. Occupations with special responsibilities such as education, training, and nursing that are in close contact with people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Among netizens’ reactions, no one complained about his father Li’s beating of Xie to a minor injury, let alone treating it as “intentional injury.” Instead, there were various “beatings” &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;It&#39;s not an exaggeration to beat him to death&quot;. Does such a sound sound &quot;tyrannical&quot;? not at all. This is the manifestation of the &quot;simple sense of justice&quot; or &quot;emotion of law&quot; inherent in every normal person&#39;s heart. Indignation makes us human, and integrity must mean knowing what to love and what to hate. Confucius said: Only benevolent people can love others and hate others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Netizens also had complimentary words for the local procuratorate, such as &quot;the light of justice&quot; and &quot;wanting to send a banner.&quot; If the law were applied mechanically, the father could be prosecuted and sentenced if he beat someone to a minor injury of the second degree. There are many cases like this in reality: one spouse cheats, the other catches the cheater in bed, and beats the lover wildly in anger. Then the lover goes to assess the injury. As long as the injury is minor, the other spouse will either pay for a settlement or be charged with intentional injury. Although it is legal to go to jail and let the attacker go to jail, it is against human ethics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, to some extent, the above cases reflect the conflict between natural law and statutory/statutory law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called natural law/natural rights simply means that laws are discovered, not invented or formulated, which is often referred to as &quot;natural law&quot;. From the perspective of evolutionary game theory, natural law is the embodiment of &quot;evolutionary stable strategy&quot; (ESS). Tit for retaliation, or what Confucius said, &quot;repay kindness with kindness, repay hatred with directness&quot; is ESS. Only in this way , can promote cooperation among members of society, suppress breach of trust and aggression, and enable society and civilization to survive. The final rule derived from &quot;reciprocity&quot; is that each other respects each other&#39;s life, freedom and property rights, as the Chinese say, &quot;Kill to pay for life, debt to pay for money.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Statutory law is made by people and will refer to natural law or customary law, but it is not always consistent with natural law or customary law, and sometimes even runs counter to it. In the fields of marriage, family and property inheritance, there are many cases Reflects the conflict between statutory law and natural law or customary law. The only daughter, Ms. Yang, wanted to inherit her parents&#39; inheritance, but found that 22 relatives of both parents also had the right to inherit (based on statutory law). Fortunately, these relatives did not think they had the right to inherit the inheritance of Ms. Yang&#39;s parents (based on natural law and common law). This is Heaven governs people&#39;s hearts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Back to the case where his father Li beat Xie. Xie obviously knew how to use legal weapons to protect himself. After being beaten, he immediately identified the injury as &quot;minor injury level two&quot;, which showed that he He also suffered injuries, using this as a bargaining chip, or wanting to offset the disadvantages he faced in the molestation case, because minor injuries can be administratively detained, and minor injuries can be sentenced to prison. The show is &quot;I go to jail, you also go to jail, let&#39;s go together.&quot; posture. Judging from the local procuratorate&#39;s handling of both cases, it is obvious that the police also completed the investigation into the beating case of his father Li and handed it over to the prosecutor. It can be inferred that Xie reported the case to the police after being beaten. Reporting the crime + injury assessment, the direction of counterattacking Li is very obvious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that the local procuratorate’s decision not to prosecute Li has resolved the conflict between natural law and statutory law in this incident. It is in accordance with the laws of nature and people’s hearts, and it is for the father Li to stand up for his daughter. The behavior and morality are very good, and it is also a good deterrent to those who try to extend their dirty hands to minors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How do individuals deal with conflicts between natural law and statutory law? My father, Li, is a good example. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different statutory provisions and different judgments based on them mean different behavioral incentives for people and will change people&#39;s behavior. For example, the case of Datong, Shanxi, where she was accused of rape after getting engaged, triggered strong concerns and debates. , one of the motives discussed by everyone is &quot;how to avoid legal risks&quot;, but generally speaking, when the rights of parents and children are violated, the emotions and temperament of blood thicker than water will prevail, at least they will be very angry, and often stand Come out, instead of blindly looking forward and backward, timid, and appearing particularly &quot;rational and calm&quot;. If a person does not show blood and courage at this time, then he probably does not have these things at all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every father and mother who stands up for their children is worthy of respect. When their children are hurt and most vulnerable and helpless, they stand up to confront the aggressor and expose the aggressor&#39;s evil deeds to the broad daylight. This is the best help and the best value for their children. educate. They let their children know that when they are hurt, their parents are their strongest backing and support; they must be as brave as their parents, dare to say no to infringements and infringers, and dare to advocate and defend their rights. If there are more parents like this, not only will those who are ready to make a move think twice about it, but they will also convey a strong and profound value system to the next generation and the whole society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国家卫健委：9月20日起将猴痘纳入乙类传染病进行管理]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256733]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-15 13:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;strong>;National Health Commission Announcement&lt;/ strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;According to the relevant provisions of the &quot;Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China on the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases&quot;, monkeypox will be included in the management of Class B infectious diseases from September 20, 2023.

In the past, it mainly occurred in Central and West Africa. Since May 2022, monkeypox epidemics have occurred in more than 100 countries and regions around the world. Epidemics in many countries have shown that monkeypox has been transmitted from person to person and has spread widely to countries and regions outside Africa, with a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%. In September 2022, my country reported its first imported case of monkeypox, and local monkeypox epidemics began to appear in June 2023. Currently, more than 20 provinces across the country have reported monkeypox cases, triggering new local secondary outbreaks and hidden transmission. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The National Health Commission and the State Administration for Disease Control and Prevention conscientiously implement the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, treat monkeypox as a new emerging infectious disease, and give full play to their multiple capabilities. The important role of departmental coordination in prevention and control, continuous improvement of prevention and control policies and measures, strengthening information release, publicity and education, intervention of key groups and standardized treatment have achieved positive results in monkeypox epidemic prevention and control. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Considering that the monkeypox epidemic will continue to exist in my country for a certain period of time, in order to further carry out scientific and standardized prevention and control of the monkeypox epidemic and effectively protect the life safety and health of the people, The National Health Commission decided to include monkeypox as a Class B infectious disease for management under the &quot;Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China on the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases&quot; from September 20, 2023, and adopt prevention and control measures for Class B infectious diseases. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/dcdb718c013bccbff37e45063b6e2e3d.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;477&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/dcdb718c013bccbff37e45063b6e2e3d.png&quot; data-key =&quot;250883&quot;>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/a7e16978f496a2d7dd21f9834e7c5ba3.png&quot; border=&quot; 0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;576&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/a7e16978f496a2d7dd21f9834e7c5ba3.png&quot; data -key=&quot;250884&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Website screenshot&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 13:55:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
