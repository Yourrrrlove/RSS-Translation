On October 8, a Nandu reporter visited the store and was informed by staff that the warning had been removed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/qpBMC7wPFEMRtg1ovzKZU80tubnLI3hkX1RlGlk8.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;789&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/qpBMC7wPFEMRtg1ovzKZU80tubnLI3hkX1RlGlk8.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253460&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The food stealing warning posted by Mixue Bingcheng. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The staff of the Mixue Bingcheng store said, &quot;There are many people stealing food and they can&#39;t be caught. We were stolen.&quot; There is nothing we can do. Some people steal food very horribly. (The warning) should be written more seriously to scare them.&quot; Regarding whether the punitive measures on the notice have been implemented, the other party said, &quot;I have not implemented them. If they have been implemented, it would be against the law. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the method of “tying a flyover to show the public” is too drastic, many supermarkets and retail stores have posted warnings in their stores that say “Steal one and you will get three penalties” and “Steal one and you will get ten penalties.” According to media reports, there have actually been cases where someone was caught stealing in a supermarket and ended up spending hundreds of dollars on it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What do you think of this warning from merchants?

They said in the letter that they would do their best to take responsibility, fully cooperate with the police and other departments to find out the truth, and do their best to mitigate the impact of the incident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the same day, the Thai government announced a compensation plan. Suthawan, Thailand’s Minister of Tourism and Sports, said that Thailand will provide 6.2 million baht (approximately RMB 1.23 million) in compensation for each victim. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three days ago, on October 3, just a week after Thailand implemented a visa-free policy for Chinese tourists, a series of piercing gunshots rang out in the Siam Paragon shopping mall, and panicked crowds ran in all directions. The tragic shooting resulted in 2 deaths and 5 injuries. The Chinese victim was only 34 years old. At the time of the incident, she was traveling in Thailand with her 5-year-old twin daughters, and they originally planned to take a flight back to China early in the morning on October 4. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is surprising is that the perpetrator of the shooting was a boy who had just turned 14 years old. He is accused of suffering from mental illness and has been sent to a mental hospital in Bangkok for evaluation of his mental condition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sudden shooting not only made tourists in Thailand uneasy, but also worried Thailand, which is eager to revive the tourism industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jidi, chairman of the Thailand Tourism Marketing Association, told Thailand&#39;s &quot;Public Opinion&quot; that due to the vicious shooting at Siam Paragon, the number of foreign tourists to Thailand may decrease by 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Revenue shrank by 50 billion baht (approximately RMB 10 billion). &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;40 gunshots&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;If it weren’t for this shooting tragedy, Li Qian’s family could have spent a happy holiday in Thailand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At noon on October 3, 2023, Li Qian and his wife arrived in Bangkok by plane with their three-year-old child. After checking in at Chatrium Hotel, they were picked up directly from the hotel at around 4 p.m. The shuttle bus arrives at Siam Paragon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Paragon is located in Siam Square in the heart of Bangkok. It is the most famous luxury shopping mall in Bangkok and was once rated as the most photographed place in the world by Instagram. Li Qian decided to make the first stop of her trip to Thailand here, but what she didn&#39;t expect was that she would be greeted by continuous gunshots. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“As soon as I got to the second floor, I heard a loud bang. I immediately had a bad premonition. Before I could react, there were two more bangs and bangs in succession, and then... I heard screams from downstairs, and people started to run away. My husband rushed to the third floor with the child in his arms, and then there were several gunshots. I was so scared that my legs were weak, and I felt that bullets were behind me. He was about to be hit at any time.&quot; Li Qian recalled to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At 3:35 pm on October 3, the assailant took the light rail and entered Siam Paragon. Surveillance video showed that five minutes later, he walked into the bathroom on the M floor carrying a schoolbag containing bullets. At 4:10, gunshots were first heard in the bathroom. Immediately afterwards, a long-haired man wearing a black shirt and a baseball cap with an American flag printed on his head came out and started shooting at the crowd. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the gunfire rang out, Huahua was in the aisle separated from the bathroom where the incident occurred, waiting for friends who were shopping at the Chanel store. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I didn’t know the murderer was next to us at the time. I just heard the gunshots very clearly.” Huahua told Southern Weekend reporters, “I thought it was a robbery of a luxury store at first. It was nothing special. It wasn’t until we later watched the news and discovered he was right next to us that we started to feel a little scared.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At 4:25, the assailant came to the second floor and continued shooting. Minutes later, he took the escalator to the third floor and continued shooting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, the gunman called the Thai police phone number to surrender, and clearly told the police his location and specific clothing. At 5:10, he was arrested in a home furnishing store on the third floor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Bangkok Post&quot; quoted a source familiar with the investigation as saying that before his arrest, the suspect fired about 40 shots in the mall, and a total of 11 shots were found on the dead and injured. bullet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despite the frightening moment, Li Qian and others were at least lucky enough to return home safely. However, a Chinese tourist and a Burmese migrant worker in Thailand left their lives in Thailand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to reports from the Thai police, the shooting at Siam Paragon resulted in 2 deaths and 5 injuries, and the initiator was a 14-year-old boy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Thailand&#39;s MGR Online news network, the suspect in the shooting incident was born in 2009 and just turned 14 years old on September 21. He is the eldest son in the family. His family is very wealthy, and his father works in a well-known university. The teenager studied in a private school with a tuition fee of hundreds of thousands of baht a year. While at school, he won the Outstanding Student Award for the 2017 academic year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As Bangkok’s top luxury shopping mall, Siam Paragon claims to have strict security measures. However, the murderer successfully entered with a gun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tosak, the director of the Thai National Police, explained in an interview that because the gun involved was modified into a plastic structure, it was not discovered in time, and the security of the mall was not as constant as at the airport. They are very strict, with people coming in and out all the time, and it is difficult for the testing equipment to conduct precise inspections on everyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, many people involved in the shooting recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that Siam Paragon had no security measures and only two or three security guards were on duty at the door. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the shooting, just a few hours after arriving in Thailand, Li Qian changed her ticket to return to China the next day. &quot;I didn&#39;t really feel safe until the moment the plane landed. From a person watching the news to a person in the news, everything was so unreal.&quot; Li Qian said that now she hears the gunshots in the video, she is still instantly taken away. Pull back to the scene of the shooting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hua Hua and her friends continued to spend a day shopping in Thailand with fear, but they did not dare to go shopping in Siam again. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Mental problems? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Paragon surveillance video showed that when he was arrested, the 14-year-old suspect looked dull, his eyes flashed, and he kept mumbling to himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tosak said the teenager had received treatment at Rajavithi Hospital for mental health problems in the past, but did not take his medication on the day of the incident. &quot;He felt like someone was telling him to shoot this or that person, as if there was another &#39;him&#39; inside his body.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another netizen who often plays games online with the assailant teenager said, &quot; He often behaves emotionally, and it is obvious that he has a heavy psychological burden.&quot; The netizen also revealed that the young man had mentioned that he had schizophrenia symptoms, but he did not take medication to control it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the boy&#39;s parents said that their son was addicted to shooting games, but he had never had any history of mental illness. In an interview with Thai TV station One News31, his mother said she suspected that her child liked to use shooting to vent his emotions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, the young man who committed the crime has been sent to Bangkok Mental Hospital for detention and treatment. Experts from the hospital will evaluate whether he suffers from mental illness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Washin, a lawyer at Thailand&#39;s Mandarin Law Firm, estimates that the results of the mental evaluation will be issued within two or three weeks, and the subsequent inspection report will be handed over to the relevant departments within a month. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on reports from Thai media, the shooting was not a whim of the teenager, but was well prepared in advance. The Thai news website The Thaiger bluntly called the shooting a &quot;premeditated murder.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Bangkok Post&quot; report, the teenager originally planned to buy a real gun online, but because the price was too high, he then borrowed money through an online lending platform and settled for 16,000 baht (approximately RMB 3164) purchased a modified blank gun. In the teenager&#39;s home, the police also found two guns and a large amount of ammunition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the incident, the teenager had invited friends with whom he was practicing shooting to go to Siam Paragon. When he arrived at the mall, he had a video call with his friends, saying that he was &quot;going to shoot.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the suspect was arrested, the police found videos from his mobile phone of him practicing with live ammunition at a shooting range, including clips of changing ammunition and shooting targets. Some netizens also posted that they had met the assailant by chance at the &quot;Bangkok Shooting Club&quot; before, and that he was dressed exactly the same as on the day of the attack. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is still unknown why the former outstanding student turned into a gun-wielding killer. However, Thailand&#39;s Public Opinion reported that after preliminary investigation, the police found that the 14-year-old boy who killed someone with a gun at Siam Paragon faced academic difficulties and his academic performance was poor, but his parents forced him to improve his academic performance. There is chat evidence showing that after the suspected teenager was urged by his parents to improve his academic performance, he instead sent a video of himself shooting at the shooting range and said, &quot;I want to go here.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 4, the head of the Kyoto Police Station in Bangkok, Thailand, stated that the police filed five preliminary charges against the 14-year-old suspect responsible for the shooting, including intentional homicide, murder, illegal possession of a gun, and unauthorized possession of a gun. Carrying firearms into public places with permission and shooting in public places without permission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In Thailand, shootings that cause death can be punished with the death penalty, life imprisonment, or 15 to 20 years in prison. However, because Thailand rarely carries out the death penalty, the maximum penalty is generally only life imprisonment.&quot; Waxin analysis , &quot;Now that the suspect is only 14 years old, he will most likely be sentenced to 15-20 years in prison. But at the same time, the court may take measures such as juvenile detention, mental hospital imprisonment, etc. to replace prison time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Mental illness cannot be a reason for acquittal, but if it is ultimately determined that there is a mental illness, the court may reduce the sentence based on his relevant medical history, and may ultimately be sentenced to 10-15 years in prison, or even a sentence of no more than Possibility in 10 years,&quot; Vaxin added. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Belated gun control&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This is not the first mass shooting in Thailand. In the past three years, Thailand has suffered three consecutive shooting massacres. The Siam Paragon shooting happened on the first anniversary of the nursery massacre. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 6, 2022, a former police officer broke into a nursery with a gun and a knife in Utai Sawang Town, Nongmo Lamphu Province, northeastern Thailand, killing 38 people, 24 of whom were children. . The murderer returned home afterwards, killed his wife and children and committed suicide. Thailand’s Public Broadcasting and Television reported that this was the first large-scale terrorist attack targeting children’s places in Thailand’s history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously in February 2020, a Thai soldier went on a killing spree with a gun in a shopping mall in the northeastern city of Nakhon Ratchasima, killing 29 people and injuring 57 others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Amnesty International human rights researcher and Thai Tatya Karonwang pointed out that given the occurrence of three similar incidents in recent years, Thai society is reminded that this may not be just an isolated unfortunate incident and the country needs to be re-evaluated. Is gun violence a systemic problem? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Until the shooting, Huahua did not know that it was legal to hold a gun in Thailand, and he never thought that such a thing would happen to him. But in fact, Thailand has one of the highest rates of gun ownership and gun-related deaths in Asia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A study conducted in 2017 by the &quot;Small Arms Survey&quot;, a research institute in Geneva, Switzerland, showed that Thailand&#39;s total population is about 70 million, but the number of guns it holds is as many as 10.34 million, of which only 10.34 million are legally registered. About 6.2 million. Investigators estimate that 15 out of every 100 people in Thailand own guns, ranking first in ASEAN and second in Asia after Pakistan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to data released by the US think tank &quot;World Population Review&quot; in 2022, Thailand has 3.91 gun deaths per 100,000 people, ranking second among ASEAN countries, second only to the Philippines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for gun control, Thailand’s relevant laws are not strict. &quot;Thai citizens who are over 20 years old need to undergo strict background checks before they can legally hold guns. They are not allowed to hold guns in public and can only be used for specific purposes such as self-defense and hunting. At the same time, citizens must put gun shells, springs Store them separately from bullets and other accessories and cannot be placed in the same place.&quot; Vaxin pointed out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in addition to legal gun ownership, there are still a large number of imported guns and imitation weapons that can be freely traded on the black market and the Internet. Wa Xin said that similar black guns are common in Thailand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Investigation data from the Thai Police General Administration in 2019 showed that there were more than 31,400 gun-related cases in Thailand that year, of which more than 24,300 cases involved unregistered illegal guns, accounting for 10% of the cases. 77.5% of the total. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Many illegal firearms are smuggled into Thailand, and Internet sales are exacerbating this trend.” Crisanaporn, a criminologist at Thailand’s Rangsit University, told AFP, “However, only a few police officers have the online Knowledge, ability and experience in tracking the gun market.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the shooting tragedy, the Thai police acted vigorously and arrested 6 suspects for selling guns and ammunition to the teenager who committed the crime. At the same time, Thai officials have made it clear that they will strengthen gun control measures and close legal loopholes in online gun sales. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 5, the Ministry of Interior of Thailand held a meeting and approved 13 gun control measures, including strengthening the registration and management of firearms, stopping the issuance of firearms business licenses and carry-on firearms permits, and requiring gun owners to apply for Short-term and long-term gun control measures include providing medical certification of mental health conditions, cracking down on illegal weapons trading websites, and redefining imitation guns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, similar measures are just bringing up old matters again. After the tragedy of the nursery massacre in 2022, the lower house of the Thai Parliament stated that it would explore short-term and long-term measures for gun control and response to gun violence. However, until the general election in May 2023, the gun amnesty bill drafted by the previous government failed to pass parliamentary review. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some experts are not optimistic about how effective the new gun control measures will be. A commentary article published on the American Diplomat website stated that short-term policy adjustments cannot fundamentally solve the problem of black market gun trading, and the Thai government must give up its laissez-faire mentality of tolerating the illegal economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Li Qian and Huahua are pseudonyms in the article)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>; &lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br >;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[掏大钱才得见“优质异性”：“相亲顾问”套路深]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258208]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Because of hitting a wall in reality or the dating circle is too narrow and lacks &quot;dating resources&quot;, go to the dating website to try your luck , it is indeed the choice of some people, but what is the outcome? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A netizen’s complaint gives us a glimpse into the words and routines of “dating consultants”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He once received a call from a blind date website, asking him to talk about their blind date services. The dating consultant asked him to find out that he was a manager of a private enterprise, with an annual income of 400,000+, and that he had a house, a car and no loans, so he recommended a dating service with a price of 70,000, and even said to him: For a high-income person like you, 70,000 is not enough. It&#39;s not a high price, but we can provide emotional services. Then he pulled up two resumes with specific information concealed from his mobile phone. Both of them had a photo of a beautiful woman. He told him that both beauties had paid membership fees of N million, and their requirements were very suitable for his situation. As long as Once he joins the association, he can immediately arrange to meet and get to know each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But his psychological price is less than 10,000. He said that 70,000 yuan was an unaffordable price for him. Seeing that he was about to get up and leave, the dating consultant said in a very disdainful tone, &quot;What we are talking about now is your life-long event. If you yourself feel that you are not worth tens of thousands of dollars, then there is nothing we can do.&quot; The dating consultant also emphasized that , &quot;Many of our members have paid membership fees of hundreds of thousands or hundreds of thousands a year, but I didn&#39;t mention it to you considering your income level.&quot; He replied, not thinking that his life event is not worth 70,000, but just I feel that this kind of service is not worth 70,000 yuan. As for hundreds of thousands or hundreds of thousands, only XX would spend such a big sum of money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two days later, the dating consultant called him and said in a familiar and friendly manner that if paying 70,000 at once was too much, the website could provide installment payments and discounts. He also recommended other packages, but he hung up the phone directly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar scenes have been exposed by the media for a long time: the target is locked in a room for two to three hours for brainwashing, and is required to pay tens of thousands of yuan in membership fees; after registration, harassment calls are received from various numbers Phone call; after registering, you were invited to go to the offline store, but after paying the money, your attitude was perfunctory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This netizen said that in his opinion, spending tens of thousands of yuan to buy a blind date service is a bit ridiculous. It was not until he saw someone actually posting a blind date service bill of 32,000 yuan that he felt that he was short-sighted. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, it is not that he is short-sighted, but that in the face of the powerful words and targeted bombing sales of some dating websites, some people will eventually be unable to defeat him. In March 2022, The Paper reported that through phone calls and WeChat, a marriage agency claiming to be from the &quot;MarryU Club high-end membership club&quot; continued to promote &quot;high-end marriage consulting services&quot; to Ms. Guo in Beijing, and promised to be able to provide services during the service period. Help her find the right match. Ms. Guo came to an offline physical franchise store on the platform and signed a 480-day membership service contract and supplementary agreement worth nearly 170,000 yuan. It was agreed that a company in Hangzhou would entrust a consulting and management company in Beijing to perform contract services and promised to provide Ms. Guo with a customized version of &quot;marriage hunting services.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;News reports tell us that the lady’s 170,000 yuan was wasted. During the follow-up service process, Ms. Guo discovered that the identity of the men provided for appointments on the platform was questionable, and some had discrepancies in age and workplace information. Some did not even leave their WeChat or contact information after meeting. “Even if they were added, (the other party) would not No reaction.&quot; While the contract was in effect, Ms. Guo met her current husband in an accidental private social interaction, and the two received their marriage certificate in December 2021. After the marriage, Ms. Guo thought she could return a certain percentage of the service fee, but was rejected by the matchmaking agency on the grounds that she violated the contract by &quot;marrying a candidate who was not recommended by the agency.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you think what happened to Ms. Guo is just an accident, you are totally wrong. Data show that in the first half of 2019, the Jucomplaint platform received a total of 1,686 valid complaints from consumers across the country regarding the dating and dating industry. In the current period, 993 complaints were confirmed to have been resolved, with a resolution rate of 58.9%. Judging from the types of complaints, they mainly include exaggerated service effects and difficulty in refunding. To put it bluntly, some dating platforms are playing tricks on you, and they don’t care about the wine but your wallet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the folk, &quot;matchmaker&#39;s words&quot; have long been the driving force for young people to come together. Theoretically, a dating website is a &quot;virtual matchmaker&quot;, but in reality, this &quot;virtual matchmaker&quot; often shows characteristics that are contrary to the function of a matchmaker. The most important characteristic of a matchmaker is to use his sharp tongue to facilitate the marriage between a man and a woman as quickly as possible. However, some dating websites are just the opposite. Their core appeal is to try their best to sign a long-term contract. To this end, they delay and consume all kinds of things until the contract is due. Period, make a lot of money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The purpose of paying a large membership fee is to find high-quality men and women, but a disturbing problem is that on some dating websites, there are really high-quality men and women waiting for you, and you only need to pay enough to find the right one. Object? In fact, you can know the answer just by looking at the logic lines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In reality, high-quality men and women have long been robbed of their heads. Do they still need to go to a blind date platform? It is said that some platforms have a large number of high-quality men and women, and after paying the money, it is yours. Is this a joke? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you pay a membership fee to a blind date website, you are essentially paying an agency fee. But many times, the agency fee is very strange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the field of real estate, intermediaries still have &quot;business rules&quot;. They can only charge fees after the house sale is completed, so real estate agents try their best to bring both parties together to reach a deal. However, some dating websites induce eager men and women to spend their money and are irresponsible for the results. They can actually continue to have a prosperous business and have no worries about customer sources. Do they really benefit from the &quot;people are stupid and have more money&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many members of the dating platform spend tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands or even hundreds of thousands, which is really no less than the agency fee for buying a house - the &quot;bulk transactions&quot; displayed in this kind of marriage and love market are full of of fantasy and absurdity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some dating platforms engage in the practice of fabricating portraits, deceiving you, and cutting as many leeks as you can. They are despicable and shameless, but they always gain the upper hand with a series of misleading and risk-mitigating techniques. This makes many consumers miserable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Those who frequently talk to you about money are not just scammers, but also people who engage in &quot;dating tricks&quot;. It is common sense to realize that it is unlikely that a dating website will have high-quality men and women, it is unlikely that you can get &quot;more&quot; by spending more money, and it is unlikely that you will be invincible with the &quot;guidance&quot; of a dating consultant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finding a partner “online” certainly has a certain effect – in fact, I have friends who found true love online, but do I have to find some “professional platform” to find a partner? not necessarily. The aforementioned Ms. Guo signed a contract but found the right person outside the platform. This &quot;accident&quot; that slapped the platform in the face fully demonstrates that hot life scenes are the &quot;incubation&quot; base for relationships. Sometimes, when you can&#39;t find a partner, it&#39;s not because you haven&#39;t entered the &quot;professional platform&quot;, but because your effective social circle is not large enough, or in other words, you are not deep enough in the ocean of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you really can&#39;t meet the right person on your own, then use your parents, relatives, friends, and colleagues to exert energy and accumulate opportunities, and at the same time try to expand your private social circle and personal media display circle to open up opportunities for yourself. The door to marriage and love is still a trustworthy path. At least, if you take this path, your wallet will not be hurt, your armor will be thrown away, and you will have nowhere to complain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is the author&#39;s personal opinion only and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[更能提供情绪价值？网购冲击下，实体店靠什么活下来]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258228]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The rise of e-commerce platforms has had a big impact on offline shopping. Coupled with the increase in consumption in recent years, After downgrading, many users, including me, have to shop around online before placing an order, and even start shopping on some platforms that are famous for their low prices, and they still find it really delicious. With such an unstoppable consumer trend, I thought that physical stores would definitely not be able to open. However, after observing my parents’ consumption behavior, I understood how physical stores can maintain a competitive advantage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My hometown has a newly built self-built house with many rooms and toilets, so there is no one-time renovation. I took advantage of the e-commerce shopping festival to buy a bathroom cabinet for the restroom. This is the product I ordered after reading countless posts on how to choose bathroom ware online. After it was delivered to my hometown, I made an appointment with the installer, and nothing went wrong in the process. The only question came from my dad. In addition to expressing his dissatisfaction with the price, he also asked me a soul-searching question: &quot;Why don&#39;t you go to a store near home to buy it? I know you, it will be easier to repair in the future.&quot; I can&#39;t answer this question, because The reason for online shopping is to pursue cost-effectiveness, but my prices are uncompetitive in front of him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I returned to my hometown, my dad couldn’t wait to take me to the bathroom they used and asked me to guess how much the bathroom cabinet in front of me cost. I said I couldn’t guess, “500 yuan!” With a proud look on his face, I could even see his inner monologue: &quot;See if I&#39;m very good. Online shopping is just a cloud!&quot; He explained to me: &quot;This is a sample from the boss&#39;s clearance, and I took it away. &quot;Of course I know that there is a difference between three-no products with nothing and brand-name products. The most direct reflection is the price, but the low price really shocked me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Misfortune never comes singly. After I went home and used the newly installed bathroom cabinet several times, I found that the sink and water pipe connections were not tightened, causing water to seep and drip onto the floor. There was no hexagonal wrench at home, and my dad was sarcastic to me again. If there was something wrong with his bathroom cabinet or water heater, he could just walk a few hundred meters and call someone to repair it, but I could only figure out a solution on my own. So, that bathroom cabinet is still seeping water, and the sound of water dripping on the tiles is my dad’s accusation against me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at it this way, it seems that physical stores rely on price wars to win online shopping. In fact, this is not the case. It’s just that my dad’s consumption concept makes him choose low-priced products. In essence, physical stores still rely on their touchability. The excellent after-sales service earns consumers&#39; dependence and trust on it. What’s even more amazing is that it also allows users to pay by providing emotional value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One summer night, my parents went shopping to enjoy the cool air. When they came back, they brought a water purifier and a staff member. They also carried a complimentary air purifier and juicer upstairs. I was worried that the two elderly people had been deceived, so I quickly dragged my dad aside and asked him what was going on. The thing is that they were &quot;bewitched&quot; and immediately bought a water purifier. The price was less than 5,000 yuan, and it also came with two gifts. The brand is a regular brand, the store is a regular store, and the staff accompanying me also wear polo shirts with the brand logo printed on them. I subconsciously used my mobile phone to open the brand&#39;s online store and looked for the model my dad bought. After searching to no avail, I consulted online customer service. It turned out that the online and offline models were different. I didn’t buy fakes, but looking at the two gifts, I knew they must be expensive. I still don’t understand the reason why wool comes from sheep. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My dad is a person who likes petty bargains, but buying a water purifier is not because it is cheap or because of the two gifts, but because the staff really win people&#39;s hearts. They are not robots in online shopping malls that use text to express intimacy. The guy who came to my house to install a water purifier, after being in contact with him for a while, I thought I might not be able to help but pay for him. During the installation process, he patiently explained the knowledge about use and maintenance to my parents. After completion, he was not in a hurry to leave, but opened the packaging of the juicer and demonstrated how to use it. I was standing aside at that time, knowing how to operate the juicer without reading the manual, so he could leave and get off work. But he asked my mother for bananas and milk, put them in the cup, pressed the button, and explained the operation at the same time. The juicer made a sound like an electric drill. My parents stood beside him quietly, watching with smiles. After the juice was finished, he poured two glasses and handed them to my parents. The three of them were talking and laughing. I was at the other end of the living room, watching this scene, and it felt like they were a family of three. Do you think it&#39;s worth the money? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the emotional value that online shopping is difficult to provide. In addition to a large number of middle-aged and elderly people who cannot use smartphones and shop online, there is also a group of people who firmly believe in physical stores and that only tangible products in the store and face-to-face sales staff can bring a sense of security. The e-commerce economy is booming, but many physical stores are not only surviving, but doing well. I think this is also a little bit of the needs of contemporary people who are prone to emotional emptiness. They need companionship, comfort, real touch and face-to-face communication. Only such care can make cold materials have extra value, and can Be willing to pay for it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is an employee of a state-owned enterprise in Hangzhou, Zhejiang)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>; •&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The &quot;hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of Southern Weekend App is looking forward to your contributions.

Fosse had been carefully preparing for this call for ten years—after all, he had been part of the hot debate about the Nobel Prize in Literature for ten years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I was surprised, but at the same time, in a sense, I wasn&#39;t,&quot; he told Swedish public broadcaster. Fosse promised to drive home carefully. He is the most famous living playwright in the contemporary era and his works have been performed the most. He also writes prose, novels, poetry, children&#39;s literature and translation works. His works have been translated into more than fifty languages. After receiving the Nobel Prize, he complained that there would be no more big prizes to win in the future, &quot;Everything will go downhill from now on!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jorn Fosse was born in 1959 in Haugesund, a small town on the west coast of Norway. De, who made his debut in 1983 with the novel &quot;Red, Black&quot;, began drama creation when he was around 35 years old and completed 40 plays including adaptations in 20 years. According to The New Yorker, after a very successful and busy period working almost exclusively as a playwright, in 2012 Fother converted to Catholicism, gave up drinking, remarried, and rarely wrote plays again, &quot;writing another The idea of ​​a script no longer entertains”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, John Fosse published his most important masterpiece of novels in recent years, &quot;September&quot;. This series of seven novels is written in the form of a monologue, nearly a thousand pages of stream-of-consciousness narration, with sentences never interrupted. According to the New Yorker, the narrator of &quot;Seven Parts&quot; is a painter named Asle, a convert to Catholicism who is mourning the death of his wife Ales. On Christmas Eve, Asler discovers his friend, a painter of the same name, unconscious in a Bergen alley, dying of alcohol poisoning. &quot;Their memories overlap, repeat, and gradually merge into A single voice, a vague consciousness capable of existing in many times and places simultaneously.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After winning the Nobel Prize, Fosse said in an interview that after completing &quot;Seven Parts&quot;, &quot;this announcement was expected to a certain extent.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fosse always insisted on writing in Nynorsk, a language spoken only in the western and central regions of southern Norway. Nynorsk, also known as New Norse, is a written language formed by a linguist who collected dialects from rural areas of Norway in the mid-19th century. Compared to Norway&#39;s other official language, written Norwegian, Nynorsk has a small footprint. In Norway, the first language in which students are taught is supposed to be decided by referendum in each school district, but as of 2016, only 12.2% of primary school students accepted Nynorsk as the main written language. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ninosk is a language that Fosse, who was born in the West Coast countryside, learned as a child. He attributed the award to the language itself, which he believed brought a sense of freshness. He is good at turning blank space and silence into speech, and even believes that &quot;Oriental audiences can best understand my works.&quot;诺贝尔文学奖委员会主席安德斯·奥尔森在瑞典学院关于福瑟的作家生平录中提到，在对语言和戏剧动作彻底简化后，福瑟用最简单的日常用语触及人类的焦虑和不确定性，并提供接近神性的深刻体验。这让他获得公众的非凡认可，也让他成为当代戏剧的主要创新者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;安德斯列举了福瑟的若干写作特质。他的其中一个重要主题是，通过极简主义和断句，展示犹豫不决的关键时刻中令人痛心的变化。比如，一位年轻母亲离开公寓扔垃圾，却把自己锁在外面，她的孩子还在房内。她需要去寻求帮助，但不能这样做，因为她不能抛弃她的孩子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“福瑟呈现了可以立即从我们自己日常生活中识别出来的情况。”而在1995年的戏剧《名字》中，一个怀孕的年轻女孩正在等待未出生孩子的父亲，他被耽搁了。 “由于这种不确定感和由此产生的支离破碎的句子，紧张感在这里立即建立起来。此外，这些中断在女孩对与孩子一起过新生活的渴望和对被父亲抛弃的焦虑之间制造了沟壑。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在关于一个自杀女孩的独幕剧《死亡变奏》中，福瑟从女孩去世开始向后讲述。它由六个来自不同时代的无名人物用简短、断断续续的语言写成，这些人既有活着的，也有死去的。剧作结束于女孩在坟墓另一边发表的感人演讲，她表达了一种根本的不确定性，即她结束自己生命的决定是否正确。约恩·福瑟认为自己的写作很难归类，“你不是为了情节而读我的书。但这不是因为我想成为一个难以理解的作家，我从来没有试图以复杂的方式写作。我总是尽量以简单而——我希望——深刻的方式写作。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;安德斯·奥尔森是诺贝尔文学奖委员会主席，2023年诺贝尔文学奖公布后，安德斯如期接到了南方周末记者的邮件。他表示很乐意受访，在一天之内便返回了答案。不过，有一些问题他守口如瓶，比如评委会决定颁奖给约恩·福瑟的过程是否顺利，以及有没有其他有力的竞争者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以下是南方周末记者对安德斯·奥尔森的独家专访。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“在沉默和停顿中蕴含最强烈、最深沉的情感”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;近十年来，约恩·福瑟一直被视作诺贝尔文学奖的有力竞争者。他的名字是何时进入诺贝尔委员会候选名单的？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;安德斯·奥尔森：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;出于保密原因，我无法回答这个问题，我只能说，福瑟长期以来一直是全球知名的作家，作品自1990年代以来被广泛翻译，一直在戏剧舞台上同我们在一起。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;瑞典学院基于哪些写作特质关注约恩·福瑟？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;安德斯·奥尔森：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;福瑟的写作领域非常广泛，他是剧作家、小说家和诗人，尤其是他的剧本和长篇或短篇叙事引起了我们的注意。但在这一切中，他是一位诗人，这是他自己更喜欢的称谓。你可以从他的语言处理中感受到这一点。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;评奖主要基于约恩·福瑟的哪些作品？评委会认为哪一部是他最重要的作品？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;安德斯·奥尔森：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我们认为（福斯在评论中也是这么说的），在福斯完成了他的长篇代表作《七部曲》（The Septology）三卷本——一个当之无愧的成就之后，这个奖项来得正是时候。这本小说和他的更多散文，当然还有他从1990年代开始创作的极具创新性的戏剧，对我们来说都是决定性的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;从个人感受来说，你喜欢他的哪些作品？他的写作最打动你的是什么？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;安德斯·奥尔森：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;他能让沉默和停顿在剧场中说话，并在沉默和停顿中蕴含最强烈、最深沉的情感，这一点令我印象深刻。 《有人将至》（Somebody is going to come）、《死亡变奏曲》（Death Variations）和《秋之梦》（Dream in Autumn），都是精彩的戏剧。而在他的散文中，我完全沉醉于《七部曲》（The Septology），但我尤其喜欢《晨昏》（Morning and Evening），这是一部用闪亮和极其敏感的散文写成的关于生命来临和逝去的短篇小说。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“赋予声音特殊的地位”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;诺贝尔文学奖给予约恩·福瑟的颁奖词为：“他创新的戏剧和散文赋予了不可言说之物以声音”。评委会认为他的创新体现在哪里？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;安德斯·奥尔森：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;福瑟善于用沉默、中断和推迟行动来唤起人们内心深处焦虑不安的情绪，这是他戏剧的一个惊人特点。在他的散文中，他对重复和唤起的运用更为典型。在这两种情况下，都必须表达一些无法轻易说出的东西。福瑟以非常感人的方式做到了这一点。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;颁奖词中的声音（voice）一词，似乎也意在强调福瑟对文学语言的贡献。你如何看待福瑟的文学成就与他使用的尼诺斯克语之间的联系？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;安德斯·奥尔森：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;这是第一位获得诺贝尔文学奖的尼诺斯克语作家。我认为，如果可能的话，应该用他的母语来阅读他的作品，它有一种朴实无华的美，翻译起来不难。与挪威的另一种官方语言——书面挪威语相比，尼诺斯克语更为传统，城市化程度较低，与古挪威语的联系更紧密。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你是读的尼诺斯克语版吗？有没有好的译本推荐？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;安德斯·奥尔森：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;是的，我是用尼诺斯克语阅读福瑟，很值得推荐。我对译本没有太多经验，乌尔班·安德森（Urban Andersson）和拉斯·安德森（Lars Andersson）的瑞典语译本都非常出色。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;如何理解“不可言说”在福瑟作品中的含义？他介绍自己的写作主张，引用过两句话，一句是维特根斯坦的“在无法言说之处，人必须沉默”，另一句是德里达的“无法言说的，就只能书写”。他认为后者更接近自己的想法。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;安德斯·奥尔森：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我认为这两个说法都可以与福瑟的写作联系起来。在维特根斯坦的《逻辑哲学论》中，“不可说”（unsaysable)指的是我们无法提出命题的领域，也是我们可以称之为“真”(true)的领域。但文学、伦理学和宗教并不使用命题，它们恰恰属于不可说的领域。德里达没有维特根斯坦那样严格的真理标准，相反，他的“说”（saying）赋予了写作一个特殊位置，这一点和福瑟不谋而合。充满悖论的是，福瑟的写作又赋予声音特殊的地位，尤其在他的戏剧作品中。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;约恩·福瑟认为对他影响最大的作家有塔尔耶·韦索斯、奥地利诗人格奥尔格·特拉克尔（Georg Trakl）和塞缪尔·贝克特（Samuel Beckett），他最钦佩的则是卡夫卡和克努特·汉姆生（Knut Hamsun）。如何看待这些作家对他的影响？福瑟自己的创新又是什么？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;安德斯·奥尔森：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;很难用简短的答案来回答。福瑟有一种诺斯底（Gnostic，古希腊哲学思想，认为物质世界是邪恶的，只有通过“灵性知识”才能得到拯救）意义上的消极世界观，这一点与贝克特很接近，随之而来的是对否定和疑问的运用。福瑟的戏剧与《等待戈多》有着惊人的相似之处，但这并没有使他走向虚无主义。福瑟身上有贝克特所没有的信仰和一种消极的神秘主义，就像迈斯特·埃克哈特（Meister Eckhart，中世纪德国神秘主义哲学家）身上的那种，这在《七部曲》中非常明显。我就不谈其他作家了。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“做出精彩的福瑟表演非常困难”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你认为福瑟写作的独特性在于，对语言和戏剧动作彻底简化后，用简单的日常生活场景表达人类最强烈的焦虑和无能无力。很多作家都可以做到这一点，福瑟的特别之处是什么？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;安德斯·奥尔森：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;某种奇特的自信，近乎孩童般的自信，以及消极中的柔和幽默。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;在颁奖之后的采访中，你说福瑟的作品触及了人类共有的“焦虑、不安全感，和有关生死的思考”。这很容易让人联想到弥漫全球的不安情绪。此时颁奖给福瑟，是否也有现实意义的考量？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;安德斯·奥尔森：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;你总是受到当代世界发生的事情影响，但我不认为这是决定性因素。福瑟一直与我们同在。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你看过他的剧作在舞台上的表演吗？和阅读剧本有何不同？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;安德斯·奥尔森：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;需要指出的是，福瑟的戏剧作品极具可读性。但情况并非总是如此。此外，由于福瑟特殊的语言，舞台布景较少，要在舞台上做出精彩的福瑟表演非常困难。请先阅读他的作品，然后进行自己的心理表演！ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;为什么会颁奖给一位剧作家？虽然约恩·福瑟是当代戏剧界久富盛名的剧作家之一，但和外界眼中的热门人选，比如萨尔曼·鲁西迪、玛格丽特·阿特伍德相比，这个选择会不会有些小众？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;安德斯·奥尔森：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;对我们来说，关注戏剧当然很重要。哈罗德·品特二十多年前曾获此殊荣，我想现在是时候了。有趣的是，福瑟还翻译了品特的作品。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;2014年，福瑟接受英国《卫报》采访时说，诺贝尔文学奖通常颁给很老的作家，“当它不会影响你的写作时，你会得到它”。巧合的是，福瑟现在很少为剧场写作，去年他对《纽约客》说，写完《七部曲》后很想休息，他现在对文学翻译兴趣很浓。此时获奖是不是在印证他之前的观点？这算是一个“终身成就奖”吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;安德斯·奥尔森：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我认为可以被视作“终身成就奖”，就像彼得·汉德克（2019年诺贝尔文学奖得主）得奖一样。当然，情况并非总是如此。在这两个案例中，他们在获奖之前都取得了辉煌的成就，这一点也很重要。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;今年中国作家残雪位列英国博彩公司Nicer Odds网站赔率榜第一，引起中国民众的热烈关注。评委会如何回应残雪获奖的可能性？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;安德斯·奥尔森：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;出于我们的保密原因，我无法回答这个问题。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;在我看来，诺贝尔文学奖颁给所谓冷门的杰出作家是对文学的推介。你认为这种影响力在下降吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;安德斯·奥尔森：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;不。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color: orange&quot;

&lt;p>;目前，相关犯罪嫌疑人已由内蒙古、黑龙江、浙江、安徽、福建、河南、重庆等涉案地公安机关押回。公安机关将彻查其全部犯罪事实，在依法严厉打击诈骗犯罪的同时，深挖境内黑灰产等关联犯罪，确保全链条打击，依法严厉惩处。经过持续有效打击，已有2317名缅北涉我电信网络诈骗犯罪嫌疑人被成功抓获并移交我方，其中幕后“金主”、组织头目和骨干23名，网上在逃人员94名，有力挤压了境外诈骗分子生存空间，近期全国电信网络诈骗案件发案呈现明显下降趋势。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;公安机关有关负责人表示，缅北涉我电信网络诈骗犯罪主要涉及刷单返利、虚假网络投资理财、冒充电商物流客服、虚假网络贷款等诈骗类型，请广大群众务必提高警惕，增强识骗防骗能力，谨防上当受骗。公安机关将继续对缅北电信网络诈骗犯罪集团紧盯不放，不断深化边境警务合作，持续组织专项打击行动，全力清剿诈骗窝点，依法缉捕涉诈人员，不断扩大行动战果，坚决维护人民群众财产安全和合法权益。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;这小编大概不曾真的采访，没有当面对话，这诗脏话属性太明显，一下子就听出来的。不过能想到去《诗经》里找材料，这个思路倒是对的。《诗经》里面“颂”的部分，传统上认为功能就是“美盛德之形容，以其成功告于神明者”。神明今天固然不信了，但如何昭告成功，把话说得庄严又不刻板，典雅而不矫情，《诗经》仍然是最高典范。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同时，《彼阳》虽然是假的，而且它仅止于玩谐音梗，也算不得高明，属于“谑而虐”。但把诗写得看起来是一个意思，其实是另外一个意思，倒也在《诗经》所代表的文化脉络里，《诗经》里有所谓“变风”“变雅”，就很讲究这个技巧。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《大雅·荡》里反复强调，“文王曰咨，咨女殷商”，周文王忍不住叹息，叹息的是你商朝的命运，然后诗里就把商纣王的种种暴行，详尽罗列，反复批判。全诗结尾一句则是著名的“殷鉴不远，在夏后之世”，商纣想知道自己的结局，镜子就在手边，就是夏桀啊。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一直有人强调，商纣被周人丑化了，理由是后面的朝代，对前朝亡国之君一定是要丑化的，不然不足以确立自己的合法性。这个理由不能说不存在，但《荡》这首诗，显然不是出于这个目的写的。此诗的创作年代，是西周末期，作者明着在骂商纣，其实意图却是批判周厉王的种种。一来，这样炮火不是直接对准周厉王的，而是借商纣反弹；二来，这样写开炮的就不是这位诗人，而是周文王了。本朝的基业，都是文王创下来的，你作为文王的子孙，还能反对他不成？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《诗经》开创了这个借古讽今的传统，孔子特别对弟子们强调，一定要好好学《诗》，后世儒生自然对这套玩得极溜。秦始皇为什么要焚诗书呢？就因为《诗》确实是以古非今的极好教材。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《荡》的作者，大约是西周末的一位重臣，传统说法认为是指出“防民之口，甚于防川”的召穆公，至少情理上很对。一般人聊不到这么高级的话题，不过另有一套借诗发泄怨气的技巧。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;没读过《诗经》的，大概也听说过“溥天之下，莫非王土，率土之滨，莫非王臣”，然后凭直觉判断，也会认为这句气魄雄伟的歌颂，是出自西周王朝的官方宣传。不排除这句本来确实是宣传，然而我们今天能读到这句，却是因为《小雅·北山》，作者是周朝的一个小公务员，这四句后面跟着两句是：“大夫不均，我从事独贤。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;六句串起来，意思是：天下都是王的土，地上都是王的臣，领导真是不公平，担子就给我压得沉。——贤是多的意思，大概是一句能者多劳，上司就把所有活都派给这位作者了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《北山》的下文则有详细展开，说自己这个部门工作有多么不均：有人“息偃在床”，这个就是躺平比较文雅的说法；有人“不知叫号”，甭管老百姓多惨，关我啥事，能不干就不干；有人“栖迟偃仰”，上班准迟到，下班肯定提前走；有人“湛乐饮酒”，沉溺于饮酒作乐；有人“出入风议”，上班就是来高谈阔论的。这样的人多了，干活的自然就特别惨了。“靡事不为”，还“惨惨畏咎”，干得越多，背的锅越多。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这首诗，追求的就是一个气壮山河的口号，和下面的蝇营狗苟无缝对接的效果。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《北山》往后翻两页，又会读到一首《小明》。——《诗经·大雅》里有一首诗，第一句是“明明在下”，《小雅》有一首诗，第一句是“明明上天”。所以《大雅》里那首叫《大明》，《小雅》里这首就叫《小明》。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;小明说：“昔我往矣，日月方除。曷云其还？岁聿云莫。”过完年我就来上班了，啥时候能回家啊，转眼都年底了。“念我独兮，我事孔庶。心之忧矣，惮我不暇。”想我一个人啊，事情越忙越多，我心里真忧愁啊，怕的就是实在忙不完。“念彼共人，睠睠怀顾！岂不怀归？畏此谴怒。”想我家里人啊，那是真想啊。“岂不怀归？畏此谴怒”，是我不想回家吗？怕领导骂啊。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《小明》最后一章，尤其展示了把怨气转化为官方语言的技巧：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“嗟尔君子，无恒安息。”其实说的是你们这些管事的啊，可别太舒服啊。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“靖共尔位”，好好留在你的位置上吧，言下之意是我汇报工作要你拍板的时候，可别找不到人啊。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“好是正直”，你要做个正直的人啊，其实是说做人厚道点，该批的你就批了吧。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“神之听之，介尔景福”，神也在观察着你啊，你别为难人，会有福报的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;好吧，两千多年了，小明还是小明。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;
