Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Gao Yichen&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was quickly launched, quickly reached the target of 2 million yuan, and was quickly questioned. On October 18, 2023, the family of Hanhan, a girl bitten by a Rottweiler in Chongzhou, Sichuan After initiating a personal request for help on the EasyCho platform, he got into a dispute over the donation amount and the use of the funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The mutual aid link shows that more than 87,000 people donated to Hanhan. The total amount of donations exceeded 2 million yuan in less than a day, reaching the goal of helping. On the afternoon of the 19th, some people began to withdraw their donations. As of 18:00 on October 20, the total amount dropped to 1.9996 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;249 people testified about Hanhan’s family’s situation in this help link with their real names. The witnesses claimed to be neighbors, relatives, parents&#39; friends, classmates or colleagues. Most of the messages proved that Hanhan was injured and needed rescue. However, some voices suggested that the Rottweiler owner and the property owner were willing to pay compensation. , is public fundraising of up to NT$2 million necessary? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to easily raising donations, Li Ping (pseudonym), the owner of the building involved, told Southern Weekend reporters that starting from the afternoon of the 17th, residents started to make spontaneous donations and statistics in the WeChat group for vegetable sellers in the community. And the donation was transferred to the girl&#39;s mother, Ms. Deng, &quot;one or two hundred yuan per person.&quot; Later, someone asked in the group about the whereabouts and use of the donation, but Ms. Deng did not respond directly to the inquiry except forwarding the easy fundraising help link, Douyin video, and thank-you reply in the group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon of October 20, staff from the Publicity Department of West China Hospital told Southern Weekend reporters that the child is still in the intensive care unit and is being treated by multidisciplinary experts. His condition is &quot;much better than when he was admitted to the hospital.&quot; Smoother.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When a single request for help exceeds 500,000 yuan, EasyCho stipulates that &quot;a written certificate from a medical institution with relevant qualifications should be submitted.&quot; However, the above-mentioned hospital personnel said that the hospital &quot;did not issue any relevant expense certificates.&quot; The girl was transferred to the hospital at around 23:00 on the 16th. As of 8:00 on the 20th, the child had paid a total of 110,000 yuan in advance through the manual window. What had happened The cost is about 30,000 yuan, and there are currently no outstanding fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters contacted the girl’s mother and case lawyer Zhou Zhaocheng many times, but as of press time, had not received any response from them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 19, after raising 2 million yuan, this help link was closed. Qingsongchou told Southern Weekend reporters that this was shut down after the platform communicated with Ms. Deng and obtained the other party&#39;s consent. Hanhan&#39;s current expenses in the hospital were advanced by the property management, and neighbors around her also made donations. The nearly 2 million yuan in aid &quot;repaid Not moving”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the controversy, it was reported on the Internet that in addition to raising money easily, the Hanhan family also raised millions of dollars on the Shuidichi platform. On October 19, Shuidichou’s public relations staff confirmed to Southern Weekend reporters that Hanhan’s family had not set up a help link on Shuidichou. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Neighbors donated money, property management fees were advanced&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon of October 20, Southern Weekend reporters came to the Evergrande Xichen Oasis Community involved. Many residents said that this property can only be considered &quot;medium&quot; in Chongzhou City (Chengdu City). The entire property is divided into three phases and there is no villa area. The second phase of the building where Hanhan&#39;s family lives is unfinished, and the houses will not be handed over until the end of 2022. There are still owners who have not taken over the property. Lianjia APP shows that the average transaction price of second-hand houses in this community in the past six months is 6,594 yuan/square meter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was dinner time, and there were not many pedestrians. Some residents were walking with their Labrador dogs, and there were also children running and playing. If it weren&#39;t for the slogans about civilized dog-raising hanging up everywhere in the community, it would be difficult for outsiders to think of the tragedy of a Rottweiler biting a girl five days ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The publicity board of the building where Hanhan&#39;s family lives.

Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Gao Yichen&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After being guided by residents, Southern Weekend reporters came to the building where Han Han’s family lives, but no one answered the door on the corresponding floor. The publicity board of the building has a leaflet of &quot;Be a Civilized Dog Keeper&quot;, as well as a recent notice from the property management to all owners: &quot;In view of civilized pet keeping management, the property management center now clearly implements the inspection requirements of all employees... Key reminders in the community are that if any unscrupulous dog owners are found, If a dog or stray animal is on a leash, the patrol post will catch it as soon as possible and send it away from the community.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A resident in the same unit recalled to a Southern Weekend reporter that on the morning of the incident, most parents On the way to take my children to school, &quot;there are very few people in the community.&quot; She is still afraid these days. If her son wants to go downstairs to play, she will subconsciously ask him to &quot;wait a moment.&quot; The resident said that he did not know Hanhan&#39;s family, and his community group did not organize donations, but these days everyone was intensely discussing the girl being bitten. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Luo Xia (pseudonym), another mother in the same unit, remembers that before her community group received the easy fundraising link sent by Ms. Deng, some neighbors spontaneously donated money in the group. Donations of varying amounts were forwarded by the group owner, and many people donated. Luo Xia saw someone donating 500 yuan, but she donated less than 100 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The chat records provided by Li Ping show that the aforementioned vegetable sellers made three donations to Hanhan, namely 3566 yuan, 266 yuan, and 1416 yuan. On October 17, after the first two transactions were accepted, Ms. Deng replied &quot;Thank you.&quot; Li Ping said that these days, some residents who are not in the group also want to ask them to transfer donations, and some privately ask Ms. Deng’s WeChat account to donate to her. &quot;We are all parents, and we cannot bear to see our children suffer.&quot; Li Ping explained why she donated money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshots of group donations provided by community residents.

Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Luo Xia was thinking that the compensation would not be paid soon, so the neighbors first raised some money for Hanhan&#39;s family to deal with the emergency, &quot;Like us ordinary people, it is not easy to buy a house. You still have a mortgage, how much money can you have?&quot; Afterwards, she asked the group owner how much money they had raised in total. The group owner did not tell her the specific amount. Luo Xia estimated that if she gave it to the other party, &quot;it might be 20,000 to 30,000.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the easy way to raise donations, attorney Zhou Zhaocheng said in an interview with the media on October 20 that the couple dressed simply, did not wear brand-name clothes or jewelry, and lived in an ordinary environment. The two of them are currently unemployed and devote themselves to taking care of their daughter in the hospital. They have no financial resources for the time being. Although follow-up rights protection will be launched one after another, as far as the child&#39;s treatment is concerned, the compensation payment is &quot;obviously too slow.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the same day, a reporter from Southern Weekend asked the housekeeper of the building as the owner. The other party said that the girl&#39;s treatment fee was currently paid by the property owner. &quot;After all, we will not be held responsible for what happened in the community.&quot; shirkable&quot;. The housekeeper said he did not know the specific amount of advance payment. Southern Weekend reporter learned from EasyCho that the current amount of advance payment from the property owner is around 100,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Family members estimate the amount themselves&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As of October 20, Hanhan&#39;s family uploaded the West China Hospital&#39;s advance payment receipt, illness certificate, etc. in the easy mutual aid link. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the certificate of illness, in addition to multiple traumas caused by dog ​​bites, Hanhan also suffered from contusion and laceration of the right kidney, sepsis, embolism of the lower branch of the right renal artery, contusion of the liver, and fracture of the ribs. In addition, according to public information, Hanhan&#39;s family&#39;s annual income is between 30,000 and 100,000 yuan. They have a house, a car worth less than 100,000 yuan (not sold) and liabilities of more than 200,000 yuan. Hanhan does not have medical insurance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; EasyCho explained to Southern Weekend reporters that Hanhan’s fundraising project was initiated by her family on the 18th and passed the AI ​​review. After the link was widely forwarded and the amount of donations increased rapidly, the platform conducted a manual review. The review process required the fundraising staff to confirm the family&#39;s financial situation with Hanhan&#39;s family members and attorneys, and also communicate with the hospital, subdistrict office, and public security department. Verify authenticity from the side. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;(The girl) has no medical insurance or new rural cooperative medical insurance, and has not had time to buy it. The mother of the child seems to have just been working for a month and has no income. The father only earns several thousand yuan a month. We can’t afford it (the cost of ICU) at all,” explained a person involved in EasyCho. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Fundraising content.

Network screenshot&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the self-discipline convention signed in August 2020 by Internet serious disease help platforms such as Qingshuanchou, Shuidichou, and Lovechou, if an individual’s single request for help exceeds 500,000 yuan, the sponsor should submit relevant documents. A written certificate from a qualified medical institution will be reviewed and published by the platform before the fundraising link is initiated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why did EasyChou open a help link for Hanhan with a target of 2 million yuan without obtaining relevant certificates? The public relations staff of EasyChou explained that considering that the child&#39;s condition was &quot;really very critical&quot; at the time, &quot;the family will communicate with the hospital.&quot; Afterwards, the family estimated such an amount, and we launched a (mutual aid fundraising link) for her.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The public relations officer also said that if the child uses this donation of nearly 2 million yuan for subsequent treatment, the platform will review the hospital&#39;s receipts and testing documents based on Hanhan&#39;s treatment. &quot;We will make a settlement at each stage, and then we will transfer the money to the hospital.&quot; He said that what can be guaranteed is that &quot;this money will definitely not reach the hands of the family.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If a user who donated money wants a refund, there is also a corresponding channel for Easy Raising. After the donor applies and provides relevant certificates, the previous funds can be returned via the original route. EasyCho stated that if the final expenditure is less than 2 million yuan, the money can be donated to other charity foundations. It will be decided by the family as to which charity foundation to donate to and which groups to help. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A former staff member who left EasyChou in 2021 analyzed to Southern Weekend reporters that the fundraising platform will also hope to gain higher visibility and better reputation through social public events, but Hanhan’s The fundraising link and fundraising speed are &quot;really too fast&quot;: &quot;We have helped many people before, spending more than one million yuan, but this is the first time we have encountered such serious cases of dog bites.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot; _blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best &lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 22:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[柳大华实名举报棋协领导：有无操纵比赛胜负与奖金分配应彻查丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259037]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On the evening of October 17, 2023, chess player Liu Dahua posted a video on his personal social media to &quot;report&quot; the country under his real name Guo Liping, deputy director of the Chess and Card Sports Management Center of the General Administration of Sport, has attracted public attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Dahua accused Guo Liping, &quot;For a long time, she has protected and connived at the evil forces in the chess world, and openly used computer software and modern technological means to manipulate and arrange the outcome and prize distribution of various large-scale domestic competitions.&quot; And It was said that Guo Liping &quot;did not investigate this shocking scandal, but instead suppressed and retaliated in every possible way against the athletes and coaches who came forward to expose the scandal&quot; and demanded &quot;a thorough investigation and serious handling to return a clear and just sky to the Chinese chess community.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 18, the staff of the Chess and Card Sports Management Center stated that they had been informed of the matter and reported it to their leaders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Dahua did not produce any evidence in the &quot;report&quot;. How long is &quot;a long time&quot;? Who are the &quot;evil forces in the chess world&quot;? Which one is the “shocking scandal” referring to? Who did Guo Liping protect, condone, and retaliate against? What kind of games are &quot;manipulating the outcome of the game and arranging the distribution of prize money&quot;? Therefore, Liu Dahua should submit more concrete evidence to support the accusation, otherwise the &quot;scum&quot; and other statements are purely personal attacks, and the accusation is suspected of slander and defamation, and he should also bear corresponding legal liability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for &quot;using computer software and modern technological means to manipulate the game&quot;, it is the focus of Liu Dahua&#39;s report video. The outside world also thinks based on this that this report may be related to this year&#39;s &quot;recording scandal&quot; in the chess world. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since Kasparov lost to &quot;Deep Blue&quot; in 1997, all chess sports have had to face the challenges of computer software and artificial intelligence. Compared with Go, which can only be played by deep learning AI, Chinese chess has been conquered by computer CPUs in the PC era at the beginning of this century. &quot;Being unable to play on a computer&quot; is not an issue in the Chinese chess community. &quot;Software cheating&quot; is a topic that has been discussed for many years. Once chess players use computer software, almost no one can beat the &quot;human-machine combination&quot; opponent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The use of technological means to manipulate the outcome of games and arrange the distribution of bonuses mentioned by Liu Dahua is technically possible. If in the past, manipulation of the game required smoothing and management, today, if you want to determine the outcome by default, you only need to use technological means, such as hiding smart communication devices into the arena, and &quot;human-machine integration&quot; with the background in real time, so you will naturally be invincible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For many years, it has become a common practice for Chinese chess players to accuse each other of &quot;software cheating&quot;. Even many new chess players will be suspected of using software to cheat just because their winning rate is too high, and this has even developed into mutual suspicion. , a point where everyone is in danger. Chess player Wang Tianyi has repeatedly encountered similar accusations, and even encountered a &quot;demonstration with a jammer&quot; by his opponent Zheng Weitong during a match. Therefore, as soon as Liu Dahua&#39;s report video came out, many chess enthusiasts believed that this incident was a follow-up to the &quot;recording scandal&quot; three months ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Recording Gate&quot; incident occurred in mid-July 2023. The recording content is mainly a conversation between chess players Wang Yuefei and Hao Jichao. The two of them mentioned &quot;buying and selling chess&quot; in slang, and also hinted that chess Hand Wang Tianyi &quot;instrument cheating&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident fermented, chess player Dang Fei expressed his position online, taking the attitude of &quot;demanding a thorough investigation&quot; and always &quot;connoting&quot; Wang Tianyi on social media. During this period, there were also episodes of &quot;Dang Fei issued a lawyer&#39;s letter&quot; and &quot;Wang Tianyi responded live on the air&quot;. The incident has not been resolved to this day. Dang Fei is Liu Dahua&#39;s disciple who broke into the house. On October 18, he also released a real-name report video, saying that he had 90 minutes of recordings and had forwarded the evidence to the relevant departments. It can be seen that the aftermath of the &quot;recording scandal&quot; is rippling, and this &quot;master-disciple report&quot; has escalated the controversy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Recording Gate&quot; has been fermenting for three months, from &quot;instrument cheating&quot; and &quot;buying and selling chess&quot; in the recording gate to Liu Dahua&#39;s accusation of &quot;computer software manipulating the game and arranging the outcome of the game.&quot; and bonus distribution.&quot; Whether these accusations are true or false accusations should be investigated by the Discipline Inspection and Supervision Department of the General Administration of Sports and even the public security organs, rather than remaining in a public opinion war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This reporting incident is enough to make people reflect on the current positioning of the ancient sport of Chinese chess. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as 2005, the &quot;Zhao Xinxin buying incident&quot; made &quot;buying and selling chess&quot; a shadow hanging over the Chinese chess world. The &quot;recording scandal&quot; is not the first one this year. Audio and video evidence of &quot;chess player Zhao Guorong collecting money from students and leading people to compete in team competitions to win the title of master&quot; also made it to the Internet in August, and there has been no investigation conclusion yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;computer software&quot; mentioned in Liu Dahua&#39;s report cannot help but make people reflect. In view of the fact that &quot;buying, selling, winning and losing, accepting bribes for profit&quot; has become easier in the information age, then the value of winning and losing has nothing to do with competition. What is the significance of? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the global optimal solution to Chinese chess has been conquered by computer computing power (just like the solution to the Rubik&#39;s Cube has long been conquered by human brain computing power), it might as well gradually evolve into a spontaneously developed intelligence among the people. For entertainment activities, competitions should be organized by private organizations, which should be responsible for their own profits and losses, and set their own rules, instead of being reduced to today&#39;s &quot;human-computer game&quot;, which wastes public funds and hurts the enthusiasm of chess fans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the development of Chinese chess to this day, if it is really going to be reduced from &quot;a cultural treasure of the Chinese nation&quot; to a tool for &quot;trading wins and losses, taking bribes and making profits&quot;, then who is the murderer? Relevant departments should investigate this matter in depth and consider ways to reform the management of chess and card sports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[排队在各地“想你”系路牌打卡合影，这凭啥火的？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258625]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;When I saw it, it felt very similar to what I wanted to say in my heart.

Nowadays, it has become an internet celebrity check-in place for many tourists coming to Nanjing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;We saw someone sharing this place on social platforms, so we came over to take a look during the weekend.&quot; Nanjing citizen Ms. Xia told reporters that she was attracted to What I came here to check in with my best friend was this street sign on the viewing platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, not only Nanjing, but also in trendy neighborhoods or scenic areas in many cities, there are such Internet celebrity street signs, and they continue to attract all kinds of people to stop and take photos. In addition to being used by scenic spots, cultural and creative parks, etc. to attract visitors, these street signs are also used by some merchants with keen business sense to regard them as traffic tools to attract the public to stop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In front of a bakery near the intersection of Zhaolin Street and Shitou Road Street in Daoli District, Harbin, there is a street sign saying &quot;I miss you very much in Harbin&quot;.

Others, such as some milk tea shops, coffee shops, snack shops, etc., have also erected various street signs to attract people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, some famous landmarks and road signs are also sought after. For example, the Drum Tower street sign in Beijing has become one of the most popular street signs at the moment. In order to hit the Gulou street sign, some young people will even take a hard seat on the train for more than ten hours and then wait in line for two hours to complete the photo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The popularity of street signs has also become a kind of social currency. So far, the topic &quot;The whole Internet calls for missing you street signs&quot; has been viewed nearly 5 million times on the social platform Xiaohongshu, and has been played more than 670 million times on the short video platform Douyin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Judging from some social platforms, young people are not only keen to show off their various &quot;Miss You&quot; series of street signs, but also some anti-bone street signs such as &quot;I endure in Chongqing.&quot; &quot;You&#39;ve been around for a long time&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m eating in Xi&#39;an and waiting to die&quot; are also popular. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Ms. Fan, who runs a metal materials factory in Shanghai, said that she started the road sign customization business in 2020.

In addition, City walks have emerged in various places, and young people have started walking in the city, taking photos while walking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;These trips naturally bring traffic to scenic spots, Internet celebrity spots, streets and alleys, and this traffic is reflected on social platforms, that is, many people take photos of street signs. In other ways, the check-in goal of &quot;I have been here before&quot; was completed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From a historical perspective, street signs are essentially one of the forms of plaques. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In terms of cultural origins, plaques are an indispensable decoration in Chinese classical architecture. Whether it is a building, a platform, a pavilion, a pavilion, a pavilion, a pavilion, a hall, or a pavilion, plaques are in harmony with the building. They are an essential part of the building and are equivalent to the eyes of the building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Taking a plaque and showing the inscription on the plaque is the fastest way to convey that you have visited this place or like this place. In front of many historic sites, towers or mountain peaks, whether it is a stone tablet, a foyer plaque or a poem written in calligraphy, the public likes to take photos. This in itself is a self-evident awareness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although today&#39;s street signs have changed in form and text compared to inscriptions, they actually have the same expression effect and can achieve a &quot; The functions of &quot;I checked in here&quot; and &quot;Say this sentence for me&quot; are a modern &quot;mouth substitute&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Moreover, compared with the rigidity of plaques on ancient buildings, today’s street signs can be humorous and can also be customized with various golden sentences, making them more personalized and youthful in expression. , can better interact with the mood of young people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/HhTRsdQmapKYKUNw4xVmj1bOhwm7cdeOQKEFiyqy.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/HhTRsdQmapKYKUNw4xVmj1bOhwm7cdeOQKEFiyqy.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254425&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;Are street signs so popular that they annoy people? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is worth noting that the large-scale imitation and transplantation of similar street signs in various places has also brought criticism to the popular street signs. Recently, the street signs installed by Zhejiang University, Central Academy of Fine Arts and other universities have been criticized by some freshmen. Some people said directly: &quot;I don&#39;t even want to take a look at the Internet celebrity aura that comes to my face.&quot; Others said euphemistically: &quot;It feels a bit out of class.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Moreover, with the continuous increase of Internet celebrity street signs, there are also problems with illegal construction of street signs in some areas. Since July this year, Shanghai, Ningbo, Shiyan, Leshan and other places have removed such illegal &quot;Internet celebrity street signs&quot; placed on the roadside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Relevant staff from the Zoning and Place Names Office of Ningbo Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau of Zhejiang Province explained, &quot;Road name plates are a type of place name signs, which are national legal landmarks. It is also a kind of public facility and should be set up by the civil affairs department.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Captain He of the Comprehensive Law Enforcement Squadron of the Pujiang County Comprehensive Administrative Law Enforcement Bureau in Jinhua, Zhejiang Province said, &quot;These The size and shape are actually relatively close to, or basically the same as, the standard place name signs set up by the government’s civil affairs department. The Internet celebrity street signs we manage are mainly for those set up along the street, and are actually a type of place name sign. &lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It can be seen that if you just follow the trend without thinking and set up some Internet celebrity street signs in places such as universities and libraries, some of the styles do not match, and it may be wrong. Causing disgust. Secondly, if the road signs are installed by merchants themselves and named randomly, it is easy to mislead people to go the wrong way or find the wrong place, causing people to lose time and money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In this regard, Professor Gu, associate professor at Southeast University School of Law and public member of the Nanjing Urban Governance Committee, analyzed, “Internet celebrity street signs that hinder public order require relevant departments to promptly Intervention and regulation. However, it is also the goal of urban management to explore more and better cultural and creative solutions and Internet celebrity designs that can attract traffic and bring economic benefits while taking into account social responsibilities.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In general, street signs that extend the traffic function can be viewed dialectically from multiple angles and optimize strategies. The presentation of street signs must, on the one hand, ensure the identification function of public facilities, and on the other hand, provide appropriate space for the presentation of &quot;Internet celebrity street signs&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;While diverting traffic without interfering with public travel, this may be the development direction of characteristic road signs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[硬核军训是怎么炼成的]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258988]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/A72oqQdD8BybPWTNg0BalhXWNoO5Mh57DFsDOpHt.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;612&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/A72oqQdD8BybPWTNg0BalhXWNoO5Mh 57DFsDOpHt. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254443&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guangxi Guilin University of Electronic Science and Technology 2023 freshmen military training demonstration&lt;span style=&quot;color: # aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Special Warfare Mode&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The alarm sounded, orange-red and white smoke staggered and dispersed, and the air was filled with sulfur smell. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than forty students wearing camouflage uniforms and holding model Type 95 rifles approached in batches from one side of the green field to the other. There are scattered fire rings made of cardboard boxes and obstacles covered with camouflage nets along the way. The advancers either suddenly fell down or rolled out of their guns to avoid the explosions flying from the opposite side. Every time he stopped neatly, he was still in the shooting posture, with the muzzle of the gun pointed at the &quot;enemy camp&quot; ahead. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this military training exercise, students acted as a special operations force of our country. Their mission at the moment is to board a strange border island to rescue the hostages held by terrorists. More than 20 people, including &quot;hostages&quot; and &quot;robbers,&quot; were stationed under a camouflage awning on the other side of the playground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While advancing, we encountered stubborn resistance from the enemy. Many special forces &quot;fell&quot; and 7 &quot;sacrificed&quot;. Medical soldiers wearing white armbands rushed into the smoke-filled battlefield in groups of four. The two in front held guns for cover, and the two behind carried the wounded onto stretchers for treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The robbers were equipped with more heavy firearms: a mortar and two rocket launchers. We only have one rocket launcher. When the battle was lost, the special forces issued a request for support. Subsequently, simulated armored vehicles and tanks manufactured at a 1:1 ratio were driven onto the playground one after another. With the support of solid barriers and mobile turrets, the special forces team successfully reached the enemy camp. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rescue soldiers and tanks have surrounded the enemy camp layer by layer, but the robbers are still guarding the &quot;door&quot;. Our demolitions use directional blasts to blow up the stronghold. There was a loud noise and white light shot out. The hostages were finally rescued after rescue soldiers rushed in and engaged in close combat with the robbers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the military training meeting of Guilin Institute of Aerospace Industry (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as &quot;Guihang&quot;&lt;/span>;) on September 27 The finale of the parade ceremony: the performance of the special warfare phalanx. Long after the performance ended, the applause and cheers of more than 5,000 freshmen in military training echoed throughout the playground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The flame of excitement burned in Instructor Zhang. As the instructor of the special operations phalanx and the planner of the special operations performance, he also participated in the &quot;rescue operation&quot; and played the role of a special forces commander. Instructor Zhang’s skin was dark, his face was covered with sweat, and the gray and green colors of his camouflage makeup blurred together. He spoke breathlessly and in an uplifting tone. When he asked questions to the team members who were resting on the floor, he always received resounding answers and hearty laughter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Instructor Zhang is a militia member of the Guilin Garrison Area. After retiring from the armed police, he worked as a special warfare training instructor at a military training summer camp in Guangdong for four years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different from conventional military training, special warfare training imitates the training of our country&#39;s special forces, selecting the most elite &quot;soldiers&quot; and adding subjects such as tactical movements, weapon operation, and wilderness survival. It is more intense and difficult. Instructor Zhang firmly believes that &quot;this kind of education method can truly temper students&#39; bodies and spirits.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The educational concept of &quot;barbaring one&#39;s body&quot; is sometimes accompanied by more voices of incomprehension. Once upon a time, there was a young man who came from Zhejiang for training, and he always practiced gun-holding movements perfunctorily. In order to urge him, Instructor Zhang couldn&#39;t help but said some harsh words: &quot;If you can&#39;t hold a gun well, then you don&#39;t need to eat.&quot; As a result, his parents scolded him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I&#39;m not denying him food, I just want him to experience setbacks and growth. Training is not the purpose. The important thing is to let students learn the valuable qualities of self-improvement, self-reliance, and self-confidence.&quot; Instructor Zhang remembered that when he first joined the army At that time, because I was not holding the gun properly, I was ordered to do the same thing by the squad leader for a whole morning. After that, he practiced diligently and became a model in the army&#39;s tactical training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in Guihang, Instructor Zhang rarely has the trouble of not being understood - the special team members are tougher than he imagined. Among Guihang&#39;s 5,000 freshmen participating in the training, more than 80 students from various military training camps passed the selection of height and physical fitness, and finally completed the study and performance of tactics, shooting and other projects. Even if you wear protective gear, rolling, climbing and other actions will inevitably cause arm and leg abrasions. But most people are enthusiastic. Instructor Zhang recalled that a classmate from the Sixth Battalion of the special operations team had a serious muscle strain. After a day of rest, his symptoms improved and he immediately returned to the team for training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The real battlefield will not leave opportunities to lax soldiers. All the training of the special operations team are highly simulated battlefields. The human ladder construction training is to restore the scene of three people fighting together. Gun training simulates a quick response to an enemy attack. &quot;The simulated gun is relatively heavy, and the students are naughty and occasionally deliberately distort the movement of the gun.&quot; Instructor Zhang will seriously teach him: &quot;When encountering a real attack, the gun must be drawn within 1 second or even 0.1 seconds. The movements must be crisp and clear, and the eyes must be clean.&quot; You have to be keen, otherwise you will be a lamb waiting to be slaughtered.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About 10% of the people who initially signed up to join the special forces team dropped out. &quot;Special warfare training requires very high physical fitness. Carrying a 1:1 scale simulated rifle that is almost as heavy as a real gun (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;95 (The weight of the rifle is 3.25kg&lt;/span>;) to complete tactical actions, some people are not physically fit enough to do the standard.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Only the special operations team has the opportunity to come into contact with the simulated gun, and students from other companies will start to purely Yu signed up to join the special training team out of curiosity about firearms. Instructor Zhang does not encourage such people to stay because &quot;they are not interested in the special training itself. They just want to take pictures with tanks and armored vehicles. They cannot accept the hard training and cannot keep up with the pace.&quot; In his opinion, only the students themselves are active With participation and cooperation, hard-core training and realistic performances will not be in name only. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/csZ7etnCAfokT74q9Qot5lJZJSRMp9TKLcAYgcqG.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/csZ7etnCAfokT74q9Qot5lJZJSRMp9TKLcAYgcqG.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254439&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Special warfare phalanx display during Guihang military training exhibition&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;h4>;National Defense Enthusiasts&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As night falls, the mountains surrounding the campus gradually disappear, the singing of the Mid-Autumn Festival Gala rehearsal is endless, and the lake is full of students running around it. It’s an ordinary Tuesday night at the Huajiang Campus of Guilin University of Electronic Science and Technology (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as &quot;Guidian&quot;&lt;/span>;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through the lively playground and stage, in the quiet square, more than 20 members of the Patriotic National Defense Education Association are conducting their daily training. This is a club composed of enthusiasts of national defense knowledge and military training in Guidian. They often participate in the school&#39;s national defense education activities and usually maintain at least two hours of tactical training a week. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to wearing camouflage uniforms, the team members also wore simulated guns, tactical helmets, marching bags, protective gear, and military boots, just like troops going out to perform missions. They are all students participating in this year&#39;s military training for freshmen. At this time, two weeks have passed since the end of the Guidian military training camp. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since its establishment in 2019, the Patriotic National Defense Education Association has selected students who are determined to participate in tactical training for a long time from each new military training class and regularly conducted daily training on infantry combat skills. The core personnel who have undergone long-term training will assist the instructors in completing the tactical training for new students in the second year of military training. In the 2023 Guidian freshmen military training, 150 students from the tactical company were assigned to provide guidance to 30 members of the 21st and 22nd level associations. The person in charge pointed out that this kind of small class teaching can improve the efficiency of training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many of the participants in the association have the idea of ​​joining the military or the police. Lin Yu, who served as the gunner of the anti-tank team in this military training, applied for the police academy as her first choice in the college entrance examination. Joining the tactical team satisfied her childhood desire to operate firearms. Shen Hong serves as an industrial infantryman responsible for demining. His father was a soldier. Shen Hong&#39;s favorite TV drama character is Li Yunlong. He believes that this tactical training has given him a lot of knowledge and strengthened his ambition to join the army. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Fend off the enemy from the front.&quot; As the squad leader issued the order, the members of the seven-person platoon quickly completed squatting, turning over, and crawling from the stance of marching with guns, with their guns pointing forward. After hearing &quot;defend the enemy from the rear&quot;, the members who were running forward suddenly turned around, slid sideways and lay down, with their guns pointed at the rear. This is an individual soldier action exercise, the association’s most basic training program. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huang Yilong, chairman and founder of the association and a preparatory class for the children of border guards in 2019, is supervising the training of members. He reminded the squad leader to take the members to a venue without glass ballast to prevent scratches caused by the huge friction with the ground. When Lin Yu fulfilled the command to &quot;lie down while running&quot;, his movements were not coherent enough. Huang Yilonglue jokingly urged the squad leader to correct Lin Yu&#39;s actions. He explained to a reporter from Southern People Weekly, &quot;She slowed down first and then lay down. It was too slow. Now she is dead in the actual combat state. You can see that other people slid down directly from the high speed. She almost slowed down.&quot; If I go on to 0, I will still be afraid.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When talking about the essentials and operational significance of various military actions, Huang Yilong always speaks very quickly. He can talk about the &quot;three-point running and shooting position change&quot; in team operations and the obstacle breaking training of the engineering chemical defense team like an encyclopedia. Huang Yilong grew up in a military compound and liked to study various military tactics on his own. He started participating in military clubs in high school. This hobby continued into college and became an ambition. &quot;After graduation, I will either join the army or plunge into research in the military field. I will not be so comfortable doing other jobs.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The plan for the 2023 Guidian military training and the tactical confrontation performance of the red and blue squares is Huang Yilong and the leaders of the training units jointly completed the planning. &quot;Our first tactical display in 2021 will be more conservative, with only infantry and pure attackers. This year, with armored vehicles, blasting tubes and other equipment, we can display more complex tactics, and we have designed offensive and defensive confrontation, engineer barbed wire breaking obstacles and other links.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Huang Yilong, the military training exercises in Guihang, a ten-minute drive from Guidian, also made reference to this tactical confrontation model. &quot;Guihang&#39;s Military Enthusiasts Association is a fraternal association with us and shares some promotional materials and equipment resources. At the beginning of their association&#39;s establishment, we helped them organize some training. This year, we also seconded guns to Guihang&#39;s freshmen military training. Give it to them.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the next step in the development of the association, Huang Yilong hopes to form a mutual aid community with more military hobby societies in local universities to exchange more experiences in tactical training. In addition, he plans to enrich tactical training projects. &quot;In the beginning we only had simple training on advancing, kneeling and sliding, and fending off enemies. Later we went up the mountain and carried out infiltration and counter-infiltration operations in the forest. There may be new development directions in the future.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/VpLyIkjRdB9o98kmFtnycQIKGic5OP5m1r3hIaR3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot; //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/VpLyIkjRdB9o98kmFtnycQIKGic5OP5m1r3hIaR3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254442&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guidian Patriotic National Defense Education Association conducts woodland infiltration and counter-infiltration training near the school&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 >;Resources and Culture&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It takes about 50 minutes to drive from Guilin North Railway Station in the direction of Yaoshan Scenic Area to reach Guihang and Guidian. They are only one stop apart on the route of bus number 13. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both schools are surrounded by mountains, covering vast areas, far away from the bustling city, and seem to be specially designed for Qing Dynasty. Unless it is a holiday, there are few vehicles passing by on the mountain roads surrounding the school. In the nearby Yaoshan Scenic Area, there are dense forests and gentle slopes. The surrounding environment provides the school with a suitable place for field training and simulated jungle combat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guihang chose Yaoshan for training. The person in charge of the school&#39;s armed forces department explained, &quot;With more than 5,000 people training, safety is the first priority. In addition, we must also meet everyone&#39;s needs for exercise, so we walked to the mountains where there are few cars.&quot; The members of the special operations team used trees and grass to For cover, they wore gas masks and simulated woodland infiltration, jungle manhunts and other activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The supply of military training equipment benefits from cooperation between universities and between universities and military institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guidian’s imitation armored vehicles and rocket launchers are all seconded from Guilin Military Expo Park. Staff of the Military Expo Park revealed that Guidian’s national flag guard team will also come to the Military Expo Park to perform. The simulated guns and gas masks were loaned from the Army Special Warfare College. You Jiangjiao, chief of the Comprehensive Section of the Guidian Armed Forces Department, said that over three days, nearly 10,000 military training students took turns to experience shooting simulated guns. Guidian, the current deputy minister of the Armed Forces, once worked at the Army Special Warfare Academy. In order for the performance to go smoothly, he took the initiative to help the students borrow 55 marching bags from a unit in Qifeng Town. Some of the simulated mortars, tanks, firearms and other equipment used in Guihang&#39;s military training are provided by the school&#39;s military associations, and some are seconded from the Guilin Garrison District. Guidian, Guilin and other universities will also lend some equipment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, real gun and live ammunition shooting in military training in colleges and universities has gradually been replaced by simulated gun shooting. You Jiangjiao pointed out, &quot;Shooting with real guns is too dangerous. The real guns borrowed by the school are mainly disassembled for students to learn.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teachers from the armed forces departments of the two schools believe that the school&#39;s emphasis on military training Investing more resources will help enhance students’ national defense awareness and promote military recruitment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As part of national defense education, military training is also a window for ordinary students to understand the life of the army. The person in charge of the Guihang Armed Forces Department once conducted a post-training survey on the students of the school. He found that the previous military training, which had a single form and lacked equipment support, made many students question the meaning of military training: &quot;If the military training showed students all about going forward and standing in military postures, they would also find military life boring like this. It is difficult to yearn for the army. Military training adds activities such as tactical training and enriches the form to more comprehensively reflect the real life in the military camp and allow students to understand the specific needs of national defense. This can inspire their enthusiasm and belief in joining the army.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;Li Ming, a retired soldier from the Guilin Garrison District, has a military dream that was cultivated by the military training experience he witnessed in his childhood. His parents are teachers at Guilin Forestry School. Since elementary school, Li Ming has often observed the military training of this technical secondary school after school. At that time, the use of firearms accounted for a large proportion of military training courses, and Li Ming, who was watching from the sidelines, was always clamoring to play with firearms. When Li Ming was in junior high school, instructor Chen often came to this school to train students. He often played with Li Ming, who was unwilling to do homework, and taught him a lot of military knowledge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One day, Instructor Chen accidentally broke his arm while demonstrating a certain movement. Other instructors quickly rushed forward to check the wound and sent Instructor Chen to the infirmary. This scene deeply inspired Li Ming: &quot;I am an only child born in the 1990s. I can only cry alone when I am injured. When the instructor is injured, his comrades are a solid backing. We study with peace of mind, and the soldiers are also our backing, protecting everyone and the children. The safety of my home.&quot; Li Ming determined to be a soldier who can become the backing of the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, he is also an instructor at Guihang Military Training. He hopes that the seeds that instructor Chen once planted in his heart will also be planted in the hearts of Guihang students. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Is hard-core military training suitable for more people?&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The resources of the special operations training model cannot benefit everyone who participates in military training. Among the more than 5,000 freshmen participating in the training at Guihang, except for more than 80 members of the special operations team, other students rarely have the opportunity to come into contact with simulated firearms. Courses on square formations such as split formation and prisoner boxing are still based on formation training. For safety reasons, those who drive armored vehicles and tanks are instructors who have obtained driver&#39;s licenses. Students can only take photos with these models or sit on them to experience them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A classmate of the split company felt a little regretful that he did not have the courage to sign up for the special operations company: &quot;Although it is more difficult, I can also learn a lot of military skills and experience more military life. It&#39;s a pity that I I wear glasses. During the selection, the instructor said that the movements may break the glasses, and those wearing glasses cannot participate. In addition, there are height requirements, and those with martial arts and dance foundations are given priority. I don’t seem to be good enough.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;Wang Zhipeng, a lecturer in the Military Teaching and Research Office of Xi&#39;an Jiaotong University, said that the emergence of special training models in military training is to meet the military training needs of different types of students: &quot;In recent years, colleges and universities have expanded their enrollment, and the number of participants has continued to increase. The physical fitness and adaptability of students have There are differences, and some high-intensity training may not be suitable for all students. Similar activities are also held in the national student military training camps organized by the Ministry of Education and the National Defense Mobilization Department of the Central Military Commission to provide students with good physical fitness and deep national defense sentiments. A platform for growth, experience and advancement.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the threshold of student quality, special warfare training itself also has higher requirements for resources such as venues and equipment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The biggest headache for instructor Zhang, who is in charge of Guihang’s special training, is the lack of softer training venues. During special training and movements such as rolling and lying down, the hard cement floor will aggravate the students&#39; scratches. However, the plastic badminton court on Guihang South Campus cannot be used because it is close to classrooms for other grades. The playground with a 400-meter track in the North Campus needs to be shared by 7 camps. Instructor Zhang sometimes felt a little crowded, so he had to take the team to a corner of the playground for training. They had only rehearsed the full tactical display with ample space once. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guidian’s way of solving the problem is to make full use of the roads on campus. You Jiangjiao pointed out, &quot;By clearing the electric vehicles parked on the road to one side, the area of ​​the training venue can be increased, and the separated teams can train here.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Universities such as Guihang and Guidian, It has a military-industrial nature, and it is more convenient to communicate with the local military region and borrow resources such as simulated firearms during military training. But in general colleges and universities, it is relatively difficult to borrow. Xi&#39;an Jiaotong University&#39;s approach is for the school to purchase its own military training teaching aids. The special training team always has more than 40 model guns, and other students can only get 2-3 guns per company on average. The average price of a model gun is a few hundred yuan. If it is to ensure that every student participating in the training has one like a special training team, it will also be a big expense for a school that provides military training for five to six thousand freshmen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Zhipeng believes that the implementation of the compulsory content required by the &quot;Military Course Syllabus for General Colleges and Universities&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;such as light weapons shooting, battlefield medical treatment First aid, etc.&lt;/span>;), so that more ordinary students can have the experience of hard-core military training, it is necessary to &quot;increase resource investment, strengthen policy supply, and create a professional team of national defense education teachers. At the same time, teaching must incorporate the latest technologies VR, The introduction of informatization and intelligent equipment such as drones into military training will enhance the four flavors of military training, namely fun, military flavor, war flavor and technological flavor, and improve student participation and educational effect.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(At the request of the interviewee, Lin Yu, Shen Hong, and Li Ming are all pseudonyms in the article.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; /p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国常会审议通过《人体器官捐献和移植条例（修订草案）》]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259053]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Li Qiang presided over the executive meeting of the State Council&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;State Council&#39;s Notice on Cancellation and Adjustment of a Group of Decision on Fine Matters&quot; and &quot;Regulations on Human Organ Donation and Transplantation (Revised Draft)&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Premier Li Qiang chaired an executive meeting of the State Council on October 20 to review and adopt the &quot;State Council&#39;s Notice on Cancellation and Adjustment of a Group of Fine Matters&quot; Decision&quot; and &quot;Human Organ Donation and Transplantation Regulations (Revised Draft)&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meeting pointed out that strictly regulating penalties and fine standards is an important measure to optimize the business environment and reduce operating costs. It is necessary to continue to reduce fines and reduce fines that violate legal authority, do not meet the needs of economic and social development, and can be managed in other ways. It is necessary to strictly regulate the discretionary power of administrative penalties, intensify efforts to rectify arbitrary fines, improve collaborative governance and joint punishment mechanisms, seriously investigate and punish behaviors such as the administration of fines and excessive fines, increase exposure to the society, and prevent all types of benefits. The effect of corporate policies is weakened or offset. Efforts should be made to strengthen interim and ex-post supervision, improve supervision methods, standardize supervision procedures, improve supervision efficiency, and effectively strengthen supervision in key areas such as production safety, life and health, and product quality, so as to provide strong support for promoting high-quality development. According to the meeting&#39;s deliberations, it is planned to cancel and adjust 33 fines in administrative regulations and departmental rules as a package. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meeting emphasized that human organ donation and transplantation are acts of great love and charity in the world, related to the lives and health of the people, bioethics and social justice, and are an important symbol of the development of national medicine and the progress of social civilization.

It is necessary to take this revision of the regulations as an opportunity to strengthen legal protection, establish a full-process traceability and supervision mechanism, strengthen the construction of the organ donation work system, strengthen the ethical review of organ procurement, crack down on and investigate organ-related crimes in accordance with the law, and better protect the organ donation and The transplantation industry is developing healthily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other matters were also considered at the meeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 19:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[以色列进攻加沙有多难？丨军事]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258963]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/xR91tMnZtrplBiQuvhY8Iwfs2YUaEY5bS0FgMwuo.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/xR91tMnZtrplBiQuvhY8Iwfs2YUa ​​EY5bS0FgMwuo. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254430&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 13, 2023, Israeli troops assembled on the Israeli side of the Gaza border &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, due to the escalation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict caused by attacks launched by Hamas, Israel was attacked after Quickly mobilize and assemble a large number of troops, preparing to enter the Gaza Strip from the ground to completely eliminate the armed forces of the Hamas organization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the Israeli army has an absolute strength advantage and there is no suspense about victory or defeat, the Israeli soldiers will undoubtedly face a very complex battlefield. Militants who have been lying in wait for a long time are waiting for the Israeli army to enter. They have a large number of Tunnel bunkers were available and large quantities of anti-tank weapons and explosives were prepared. What’s even more troublesome is that not only do a large number of local civilians in the Gaza Strip have nowhere to go, Hamas forces also control many hostages taken from Israel, which makes offensive operations more inconvenient. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 14, 2023 local time, Israel gave residents in northern Gaza 24 hours to leave their homes and go to the south to escape the fighting. Therefore, there are constant rumors from the outside that Israel will soon launch a ground attack on Gaza. However, in my personal judgment, Israel&#39;s full-scale offensive will not begin anytime soon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the sudden incident, even though Israel&#39;s mobilization efficiency was very high and 300,000 reservists were recalled within one day, the reorganization, equipment distribution and familiarization of these troops, as well as pre-war mobilization, still took time. In addition, fire sweep before ground troops enter is also necessary. According to local news, in addition to dispatching its air force to attack hundreds of targets every day, Israel&#39;s artillery is also constantly shelling targets in northern Gaza at half-minute intervals. The purpose of these attacks is not only to destroy Hamas targets that have been discovered, but also as a psychological warfare method to constantly tire and disturb the enemy, forcing local civilians to flee as soon as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This type of attack is a typical pre-war softening method for urban warfare, just like the use of shock bombs in anti-terrorism operations, leaving the opponent confused and unable to accurately judge the time to launch a real ground attack. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to tactical strikes, Israel has also implemented a siege policy on the Gaza Strip, cutting off water, electricity, and communications. This was not only intended to punish the local population but was also intended to affect Hamas&#39;s military communications. Since Hamas is an organization that is inseparable from civilians and military, its communications rely heavily on civilian networks and mobile phone base stations. If its power and network communications are cut off, it will not only be difficult for Hamas armed personnel to charge their electronic devices, but they will also need to add additional communications. Means to ensure smooth communication during wartime. The delay in entering after cutting off the water and power grid is actually to wait for Hamas to activate the backup communication means to conduct subsequent electronic reconnaissance, and to master the frequency band, communication habits and encryption methods of Hamas&#39;s backup communication, so that the Israeli military can launch attacks on the ground Then interfere or locate the communicator. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, the newly mobilized troops and active units still need to conduct some necessary pre-war drills to become familiar with the intended battlefield environment and continuously improve the combat plan. Intelligence and reconnaissance units also need to conduct necessary pre-war reconnaissance to further grasp the real-time battlefield situation and enemy conditions. Whether it is technical reconnaissance, human reconnaissance or fire reconnaissance, it requires a lot of time and resources to complete. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the above technical laws of war, Israel&#39;s full-scale attack on the Gaza Strip will require at least 2-6 weeks of pre-war preparation time. All current information about launching a ground attack is likely to be interference signals released by Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Israel launched its ground attack, it certainly faced many challenges, of which the outside world was most concerned about Hamas’s tunnel warfare methods. There may be an entire city&#39;s worth of tunnels and bunkers beneath the surface of Gaza, where Hamas can constantly evade Israeli ground fire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Gaza is actually not as strong as the city fortresses such as Bahmut and Mariupol in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Modern war machines are extremely destructive. Only modern industrialized reinforced concrete structures can withstand artillery attacks to a certain extent. Ukraine is an industrialized country, and most of its buildings are built with modern construction techniques and can easily be transformed into fortresses that can withstand artillery fire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the houses in the Gaza Strip are brick-concrete structures. Judging from the experience of blasting operations, brick-concrete structures are actually not very resistant to attacks by modern weapons. Large-caliber machine guns can even penetrate brick-concrete structures directly. For the exterior wall of a structural house, the fragments of the internal wall that explode while penetrating can even become anti-personnel shotguns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, using wall-breaking bombs for blasting operations can easily open new attack channels on the opponent&#39;s wall. The main reason why urban street fighting is terrifying is that the defender can concentrate its firepower in the killing traps set by itself. However, if the attacker can bypass the killing traps, the traps will be useless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the issue of tunnels, although tunnels can hide the traces of Hamas on weekdays, there are actually many means of detection and destruction of tunnels during wartime. To deal with tunnels in plain areas, you generally only need to control the ground first, then detect them through technical means, and destroy them with weapons such as cloud bombs. At the same time, you can also use cement trucks to grout all the detected entrances and exits. If Hamas cannot gain a foothold on the ground and simply takes shelter in the tunnels, the Israeli army can easily destroy the tunnels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Israel also has a capability that has not been seen in past wars, which is the world&#39;s first-class design and manufacturing capabilities of cruise missiles, drones and unmanned combat robots. Israel was the first country to use cruise missiles in war, and it is still the leader in the research and development of this technology. Even the U.S. military is purchasing Israeli-made cruise missiles to equip the army. Although Israel suffered heavy losses from Hamas drone attacks in previous attacks, in future operations, Israel&#39;s loitering bombs, drones and combat robots may attack in full. Even though Hamas has learned to use drones to deal with tanks, it does not have the corresponding anti-drone and loitering missile capabilities. The ground attack will inevitably be accompanied by the reconnaissance and surveillance of a large number of drones and the attack of loitering missiles. This is Russia and Ukraine. A capability that neither Russia nor Ukraine has on the battlefield. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In any case, Israel’s ground attack will be a joint attack of sea, air, ground and unmanned systems, which will undoubtedly give the outside world an opportunity to peek into new tactics for urban combat in future wars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[王培军：我所喜看的九部电影]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258957]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/20/Tl3bAwVIiWDjuln3lIIiPIfXFnKQo1vmQZXWH3OU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;675&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/Tl3bAwVIiWDjuln3lIIiPIfXFnKQo1v mQZXWH3OU. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254699&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stills from the movie &quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last verse of &quot;Vajra Prajnaparamita Sutra&quot; says: &quot;All conditioned dharma, such as A dream is like a bubble. It is like dew or lightning. It should be viewed as such.&quot; Thirty-three years ago, when I was in college, I went to Mingjiao Temple with my classmates and bought this Diamond Sutra. I didn&#39;t realize at all at that time that the names of the movies that modern people love to watch were already mentioned here, and the profound meaning contained in the word &quot;movie&quot; was also revealed in these few sentences. Life is like a movie, and movies are literally &quot;like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows, like dew and lightning.&quot; Movies are just the shadow of life, and life is just a shadow like a movie. Most people like to watch movies, just like children who like to watch the shadows of everything and are endlessly curious about them. I can&#39;t count how many movies I&#39;ve watched, but I know the movies I watch many times because I like them. Even if you watch a good movie, if you watch it too much and you are overly familiar with it, you will definitely get bored and will not want to watch it again. This is just like delicious food, if you do not exercise restraint and eat too much to its upper limit, you will definitely get bored. , sometimes even vomiting after eating, vowing never to eat again. This is the opposite of things. Everything in the world has this dialectic. But how many times do you watch it before you get bored? The number of times you get bored is obviously a measure that can be used to detect the quality of a movie and how much you like it. The following nine movies are ones that I have watched many times but have grown tired of and do not want to watch again in the near future - of course because they are good to watch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/90EHlvLkm3J5RX3wvb61RptQMwpAiWtefgYq1Zz1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/90EHlvLkm3J5RX3wvb61RptQMwpAiWtefgYq1Zz1.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254703&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot; 》Part 1 (1987). The first time I watched &quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot; was the third part, which was in the mid-1990s. There is only one scene that I remember now, that is, Shifang&#39;s master grew his own long ears to cover his eyes because he couldn&#39;t beat the grandma. I watched it again later, and all I remember is still this incident. I watched the first part six or seven times, maybe more. &quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot; is based on the &quot;Nie Xiaoqian&quot; chapter of &quot;Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio&quot;. This is a well-known story that many people are familiar with when they were young. After being rewritten in the movie, it can be said to be &quot;beyond all recognition.&quot; But it is undoubtedly more exciting than the novel, and much better than Pu Liuxian. Although &quot;Nie Xiaoqian&quot; is famous in &quot;Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio&quot;, it is not the best chapter. I think Wang Zuxian is indeed very beautiful in this movie, and it can also be said to be the most beautiful time in his life. Some places are very poetic, such as Nie Xiaoqian hiding Ning Caichen in a water tank, in order to give Ning Caichen The scene where they had to kiss each other to take a breath was actually the highlight of the film. The tension of the atmosphere and the romance of the situation are all combined into one, and the cleverness of its conception can only be achieved by the so-called &quot;intelligent literati&quot;. But if we talk about Nie Xiaoqian&#39;s beauty, the most beautiful part is not here, but the part where she says, &quot;Ghosts are as good and bad as people, and many people in the world are more harmful to people than ghosts.&quot; Her words are so smooth and beautiful. , also complement each other. Generally speaking, the beauty of a woman&#39;s expression is to smile first, and to think secondly. Laughing and laughing wildly will inevitably impair the beauty. Therefore, the ancients had the precept &quot;laughing will not cause stagnation&quot;, &quot;smile&quot; refers to the gums, and laughter It&#39;s not beautiful when you see your gums. The same goes for crying. If you can look beautiful even when you cry, then you are truly a beautiful person. The shot of Nie Xiaoqian talking and crying at the same time is absolutely beautiful. It can also be said to be the most beautiful shot in the film. The so-called &quot;pear blossom brings rain in spring&quot; is nothing more than that! In the TV series &quot;Dream of Red Mansions&quot;, the character who plays sister Lin who loves to cry cries so much that it&#39;s hard to watch, which often ruins the scene. I have to say that this is also a failure in the drama &quot;Red&quot;. One night not long ago, I accidentally heard someone singing &quot;Flower Sacrifice&quot;. I was curious, so I searched for Wang Zuxian again and found that she was already very old. Therefore, I remembered the famous saying of the ancients: &quot;Beauty has been like a famous general since ancient times. See you grow old!&quot; Yes, everything in the world cannot withstand the flow of time. On the contrary, movies are illusory and unreal, they can remain unchanged forever, and they can allow us to relive the time that has passed! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/3jyQAmXsfn8k8ngBMz8RKYLtcTMqOszICqJy04Yn.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;667&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/3jyQAmXsfn8k8ngBMz8RKYLtcTMqOszICqJy04Yn.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254701&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Green Snake&quot; 》(1993). This is one of Tsui Hark&#39;s best films, written by Li Bihua. I wrote a poem called &quot;Qijue&quot; about this film: &quot;Qing Lei washes the horse&#39;s sentimental bones, and shows the unparalleled beauty of Wen Jun. Such a charming person can be passed down together, and Xu Jun&#39;s talent is so wonderful.&quot; &quot;Jun&quot; is a couplet written by Feng Ban in the Qing Dynasty. I thought it was quite right, so I borrowed it. I have always believed that the best match between a talented man (including a scholar) and a beautiful woman is the most elusive. The reason is not easy to know, but it may also be caused by the fact that the same colors are placed together and cannot serve as a foil to each other. The talented man and the beautiful woman are of course the same color. The opposite is not true. For example, pairing Tu Xingsun with Deng Chanyu and Wang Dwarf with Yizhang Qing are wonderful and unforgettable. Wu Changshuo, a recent scholar, had a painting of Zhu Luanshi and orchid. He also wrote a poem about it: &quot;Like a slave from Kunlun, standing by the side of a beauty.&quot; Orchid is the national fragrance, and Zhu Luanshi&#39;s skin is very thick, so he wrote it together in One picture looks strange and interesting by contrast, which is the essence of knowing what it is. The essence of a love story is a matter of matching. If the heroine and the male character are matched well, the story will be outstanding. If they are not matched well, it will be easy to fall into the trap. The combination of a talented man and a beautiful woman is the easiest one to fall into, so writing stories about talented men and beautiful women is always thankless. This is something that even the old lady in Jia&#39;s family can criticize. &quot;Green Snake&quot; is also a story of a talented man and a beautiful woman, but it is very good. The reason why it can be like this may be because of Xiao Qing&#39;s background. This is probably why the movie is called &quot;Green Snake&quot;. But no matter what, the main body of the movie&#39;s story is actually a &quot;charming&quot; tone like Zhang Jiqing&#39;s version of &quot;The Peony Pavilion&quot;. Perhaps it can be said that &quot;Green Snake&quot; in the movie is just like &quot;The Peony Pavilion&quot; in the play, It can be used as a footnote to the words &quot;charming to the bone&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/03yYLvvBIobhX8CwXQhUSOs9VUAfBZok6PUU5WxS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/03yYLvvBIobhX8CwXQhUSOs9VUAfBZok6PUU5WxS.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254704&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《新龙门Inn&quot; (1992). Maggie Cheung and Joey Wong in &quot;Green Snake&quot; complement each other and perform well, but in person, it cannot be regarded as their best work. The ultimate role played by Maggie Cheung is undoubtedly the outrageous landlady Jin Xiangyu in &quot;New Dragon Gate Inn&quot;. His temperament is uninhibited, his language is sharp and fluent, and his expressions and body movements are varied. They are all unstoppable, yet natural and subtle, all of which are smooth. This should be something that ordinary viewers can appreciate. However, Jin Xiangyu is just a common man in the market. Although he is not annoying, he cannot be said to be very cute. She is not a good match for Zhou Huai&#39;an either. She finally burns down the inn and chases Zhou away on horseback. It seems that she can take Qiu Mochou&#39;s place and marry Zhou; but in fact this is just an easy way to end the movie. From an article point of view, this inn must be burned down, and Qiu Mochou had no choice but to die. Otherwise, the article would be useless. Jin Shengtan commented on &quot;Lu Zhishen&#39;s Fire Burning Waguan Temple&quot; in the fifth chapter of &quot;Water Margin&quot;. He said it well: &quot;A writer is like a painter, and like a fire gathering, he is created and destroyed at will.&quot; Movies are also articles. , the same is true. But what I admire most about this film is not that, but the fact that in the film, no less than dozens of people from all walks of life were crammed into that small inn, allowing them to express themselves in a small space. And each has its own face, ever-changing, and everyone is different. The characters are constantly fighting each other, murderous intentions are everywhere, and they are jealous. The scenery is beautiful and embellished with the beauty of &quot;sheng Xiao, drums, harps and bells&quot;. Their relationships are complicated, their crises are about to break out, and their literary sentiments It is in full swing, a grand spectacle of &quot;acting&quot;, and the center of all these characters is gold inlaid with jade, as if gold inlaid with jade is a mechanism, and all the people and affairs in it are controlled and mediated by her. In fact, she is just The clue that the film uses to string together the drama is like the &quot;hanging string&quot; of a puppet show, which moves the whole body when pulled. Not only that, although there are many characters and clues in the inn, they are not chaotic at all. At first glance, they look like leaves blown by the wind, but upon closer inspection, they are well-organized, &quot;gray lines of grass and snakes&quot;, just like what Su Shi said in his poem about painting: &quot;There are countless leaves moving in chaos, and the source can be found for each one.&quot; This is really admirable. As for the wonderful dialogue in the movie, it is still a matter of course. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/mJ7ZrWlcCdzDNl6PCQqTwkIziYEOGguGVBesjr8n.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1571&quot; height= &quot;2098&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/mJ7ZrWlcCdzDNl6PCQqTwkIziYEOGguGVBesjr8n.png&quot; data-key=&quot;254713&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Swordsman&quot; Jianghu: The Invincible East&quot; (1992). In terms of fighting action, this film is more exciting than &quot;New Dragon Inn&quot;. As far as the Invincible Dongfang played by Brigitte Lin is concerned, it is much more beautiful than the gold-encrusted jade played by Maggie Cheung. In the movie, Linghu Chong&#39;s heroic spirit, Ren Yingying&#39;s lingering affection, and the unanimous agreement of a group of Huashan disciples who want to withdraw from the world and return to Niubei Mountain, all of which make this movie more tonal than &quot;New Dragon Inn&quot;. It is warmer and more beautiful. What is inferior to &quot;New Dragon Inn&quot; is that the characters&#39; hearts are not so changeable and subtle, but slightly thicker. However, several scenes in this film can be said to be worthy of being double-circled according to the ancient method of criticizing articles. Some of them can also be marked as &quot;famous lines, there can be no two in the ages&quot;, such as the East is undefeated in the water. The scene where he is drinking from a jug of wine, and the scene where Linghu Chong is holding Dongfang Bubai and walking in the wind under the moonlight. The scene where Lan Fenghuang and Ren Yingying are sitting on the roof has a wonderful voice, which can be said to be the best in Tang Dynasty Legend and &quot;Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio&quot;. It’s just that Ren Yingying’s dresser’s face seems wrong, she looks a little older, and she speaks in a dialect, which is not only unattractive (Lan Fenghuang speaks in a dialect, but it’s not unattractive), but also doesn’t suit the status of a young lady. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/AUMphw2CHIOe3CFfP9re5ZJiHmz3mIHKFeu8ASdu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;662&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/AUMphw2CHIOe3CFfP9re5ZJiHmz3mIHKFeu8ASdu.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254702&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Kung Fu&quot; (2004). I enjoy watching most of Stephen Chow&#39;s movies, and the reason why I recommend this one the most is because the last fight scene can be said to be the pinnacle of Chinese fight scenes. Stephen Chow loves to parody, and his scene where he beats the men in black from the Ax Gang flying all over the place should be an imitation of &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;. Many years ago, I was watching &quot;Mechanic: Resurrection&quot; on TV. There was a scene where the killer jumped from a cable car to a paraglider. My son saw it and said excitedly: &quot;我玩的游戏中，也有这个动作的，原来是从这来的。这是编程的人对这个电影的致敬！”我之听说“模仿就是致敬”，这是第一次。但《功夫》之仿《黑客帝国》，是否即是致敬，我还不能肯定。但无可疑的，是《功夫》的这一场戏，比起《黑客帝国》要打得好看得多。中国的打戏，所尚的不是“拼命努力”，“拼命努力”，从不是中国艺术的高境，中国人要的是举重若轻，好整以暇，要谈言微中，手挥目送，要不挂相、不着相，优哉游哉，痕迹俱泯，而“力小而任重”，“举鼎绝脰”，从古就是绝大的笑枋。一切事情都是如此。所以《功夫》中的这场打戏，虽然打得别人满天乱飞，但周星驰本人的神情，却也并不吃力，其大体的氛围，是轻妙好看的，而反视《黑客帝国》中的尼奥（Neo）与一大堆的黑衣特工的那种打法，用尽吃奶气力的样子，也就高下显然了。这是一比即可知、无须多说的。假如人类确是从古猿进化而来，那么中国人是必进化得更久远的一种人类，中国文化亦然，它已脱尽生野气，这包括精神的和物质的诸方面，当然也包括武打。至于《功夫》的主旨，我觉得是同于龚自珍《尊隐》的：日之昏之世，豪杰生于下，“丑类寙呰，诈伪不材，是辇是任”，“如是则豪杰轻量京师，而山中之势重”。也就是说，末世时的高手，都是隐在民间的。所以电影开头的官方警察局，就是最窝囊无用的，后面接着出场的鳄鱼帮、斧头帮、贫民窟里的裁缝、苦力和油炸鬼、两个瞎子、包租婆、包租公、火云邪神，一个比一个不起眼，而一个比一个功夫高，而电影中最高的高手，却是那个最为无用的小时被乞丐用两分钱一本的《如来神掌》骗了的阿星，而那本只值两分钱的《如来神掌》，也才是真正的天下第一的“武功秘笈”！ &lt;/p>;

data-key=&quot;254705&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《冷山》（Cold Mountain，2003）。这是以美国南北战争为背景的一个爱情电影，男主角英曼（Inman）是一名士兵，为了他所爱的艾达（Ada），而当了逃兵，要回到他的家乡。当然最终历经艰险，回到了爱人身边，但最后也被打死了。这是有点类似于《十年归》的奥德修斯式的一个故事，其故事的本身，在西方是说不上新鲜的。电影是据美国的一本畅销小说改编的，据说，那是小说作者的祖辈的一个真实发生的事。我之喜欢这个电影，主要不是在于故事，而在于人物，而那个萦绕于电影中的哀伤的音乐，也起了相当的作用，因为它使得电影具有一种抒情长诗的调子。英曼是裘德·洛（Jude Law）所饰，艾达是妮可·基德曼（Nicole Kidman）所饰，二人也很般配，看起来使人愉悦。我也乐见年轻人在般配的爱情中成为眷属。毛姆（WS Maugham）说过，一个人谈恋爱的最大年龄，不应超过三十五岁，我觉得是有道理的。爱情的故事，必须是要有点华美的才好看，而要有华美，首要的条件是青春年少。同时，在爱情的故事中，也还要有一种一往有情痴，才能够动人。 《说文解字》心部“情”字云：“情，人之阴气有欲者。”与“性”的为“人之阳气”不同。性受之于天，谓之天性，所以是不变的；情起于人事，谓之人情，所以是易变的。情有七情，包括喜、怒、哀、惧、爱、恶、欲，无时不在变中。但人世间的事，有时候很怪，凡易变的就以不变为佳，不易变的又以变为佳。所以文章以新变为好，爱情则以不变为好，这也就是“难能可贵”，——因为“难能”，所以“可贵”。英曼与艾达的爱情故事，所以能打动人心，其故在此。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/LXqVl4OWvfbzFMXAMCfThxewWcdHMRuVXZTTC0sB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2025&quot; height=&quot;3000&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/LXqVl4OWvfbzFMXAMCfThxewWcdHMRuVXZTTC0sB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254706&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《人工智能》（AI Artificial Intelligence，2001）。斯皮尔伯格（Steven Spielberg）的电影中，这一部是相对不被注意的，但却是我特别喜欢的。这是一个机器人小孩执著地寻找被爱的伤心的故事，看这部电影，有一种儿时读安徒生《海的女儿》时的那般的怅惘，仿佛心的某处被琴弦轻轻触碰了一下，而生起的如缕的渺茫的哀伤。其实电影的故事，与《海的女儿》并非一类。斯皮尔伯格真是一个鬼才。按理说，机器人是机械制造的，精密、高端、有效，没有肉心，所以机械是无情的；而他却偏在情字上做文章，使得机器与人类情感中最柔弱的那一部分，生发故事。这可说是一种相当别致的巧思，整部电影亦以别致取胜。那个小孩也演得很好。另外，在《冷山》中饰演英曼的裘德·洛，在此片中饰一被制造作轻佻的青年男子的机器人，亦惟妙惟肖，与英曼的形象大反，简直辨认不出，这也是可以一提的事。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/3a5V5aE0HHpcnUndKkWzvFtLwyKFH9ZSvTYYwepR.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;615&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/3a5V5aE0HHpcnUndKkWzvFtLwyKFH9ZSvTYYwepR.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254707&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《星际穿越》（Interstellar，2014）。这是与时间有关的一个电影。时间是宇宙中的一个谜，也是宇宙中最迷人、最伤脑筋的一件事，它从古就引起哲人的沉思、诗人的咏叹，却又是不能定义，也捕捉不住的。 “人生不满百，常怀千岁忧”，人生不过百年，一百年也就是31.5576亿秒，但是我们所思想的，有时则在一百亿个31557600秒之外。宇宙中的每一秒，都如电光石火，稍纵即逝，一百年中的每一秒，亦是如此。所以以弗所的赫拉克利特（Heraclitus）说，“你不能两次踏进同一条河流”（Upon those that step into the same rivers different and different waters flow）。 “时间枯萎了青春的娇妍，时间摧残了美人的眉黛，它饱餐自然真理的珍馐，万物都在等待着它那镰刀来割刈”。诺兰（Nolan）执导的电影，2010年的《盗梦空间》（Inception），也是我很喜欢看的；但看了两遍之后，就不想再看了。这是所有以新奇取胜的电影（也包括其他作品）的通病，无可避免。但《星际穿越》就不同了，它的内容要丰富得多，而它的场景是那样宏大、浩瀚，有时是诗意的，透射着一种深邃宇宙中才有的庄严和神秘。在所有的科幻片中，这是我看的遍数最多，也是最喜欢的一部。有一年我读刘光第诗，里面有一联，是写下西陵峡的：“大波颓作阱，长舸立如锥。”立刻想起在Miller星球上，那一望无际的浅浅的水，几分钟后，就变成绝壁悬崖一样的巨浪打过来，那么大的飞船，霎时像一只长形的小盒子，被那个巨浪掀立起来。这个镜头堪称天才的手笔之一，惊心动魄，这当然也不是晚近人的诗所能摹写于万一的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/D0X5B75SkBgJM91PU5UhoRWzkST9YxnNd3rTVL3C.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;1733&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/D0X5B75SkBgJM91PU5UhoRWzkST9YxnNd3rTVL3C.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254700&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《深蓝》（Deep Blue，2003）。这部电影可以说是一篇史诗的巨制，一部沉思翰藻的杰作，亦是最足以见出西方伟大精神之所在的作品。西方在庄严伟大上，确是要远胜过中国的，犹之中国的风神隽逸，亦非西方所可及。对于这部电影，我认为除了去看，是不用再说别的什么了。孔子的“予欲无言”，我看了这个电影，亦大有同感。也就是说，批评有时是多余的，欣赏即可。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我本来很想凑足“十部电影”，但想来想去，也想不出另外的一部，只好姑且算了。后来一转念，记起汪容甫的《释三九》，说“积而至十，则复归于一，十不可以为数，故九者，数之终也”，九是最大之数，“九部电影”正是恰好的数，又何必要凑到“十”呢？况且六十四卦的爻，不是也以“九”为名，说初九、九二、九五等等吗？其实不仅是“九”，就是“十九”，也是一个大数，古历法即以十九年为一章，阴历的生日，过十九年始与阳历生日合，所以《庄子》中说“今臣之刀十九年矣”。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;10月15日开跑的青岛海上马拉松赛出现了现场混乱的情况。有网友在社交媒体上表示，赛事现场补给不充足、人员分流不到位、领取完赛奖牌排队太久……现场甚至出现群众高喊“退钱”的情况；同样于15日进行的临沂马拉松赛也出现了争议一幕：冠军选手在冲过终点线时，被两名拉线员用横幅阻挡。不过好在工作人员及时赶到，冠军最终顺利通过。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最大的争议，发生在同一天的大连马拉松赛场。中国选手尹顺金在最后冲刺阶段被一辆引导车挡住去路，导致冲冠失败。此事在社交媒体引发热议，赛事主办方专业性也遭受质疑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;针对近期马拉松赛事的频发乱象，10月19日中国田径协会发布《中国田径协会关于进一步加强全国路跑赛事竞赛组织工作的紧急通知》指出，近期，部分路跑赛事发生竞赛组织方面的问题，引起社会的广泛关注，造成一定的负面影响，要求强化赛事组织各方责任，严格执行比赛规则，排查安全隐患，做好服务配套，提高办赛质量，及时上报突发事件与情况。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;马拉松赛事组织方面的各项问题由来已久，并非最近才爆出来的新闻。马拉松赛事组织问题，至少牵涉到两个层面的问题，一是赛事本身的硬件设施、办赛条件，牵涉到主办方的专业性；二是赛事能否保证比赛的公平性，尊重多个民事主体在赛场内外的合法权益。这两个层面的问题，都时刻考验着各地马拉松的赛事组织水平。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从专业性来说，此次青岛与临沂两地马拉松出现的状况，就是主办方在硬件设施不达标、软件配套不完备的情况下“带病办赛”，以至于让观众吐槽、让选手受累。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;专业性不足，自然会影响比赛的公平性。如果说临沂马拉松的“拉线员用横幅”还可解释为专业能力不足、最终并未影响冠军队员比赛成绩的话，那么大连马拉松出现的情况就难免让人朝着另一方向解读了。大连这辆引导车的“诡异转向”实在是不专业得不像话，不少网友合理怀疑这是主办方的盘外招，目的是为了保证特定运动员可以拿到比赛成绩，赛事的公平性因此遭遇质疑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;细审这些马拉松赛事里的争议，一旦赛事的专业性与公平性出现问题，运动员就是首当其冲的受害者，现场观众也会大喊“退钱”，本地市民也难免受害。试问，主办方与运营公司能否承担责任，赔偿他们的各项损失？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以此次大连马拉松而言，运动员尹顺金遭遇引导车这么一挡，损失的不仅是他一个人的比赛成绩。赛事办到这个份上，花钱买票的现场观众也会感觉看了场假马拉松。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在目前这种“各地政府牵头主办、运营公司商业开发”的模式下，各地马拉松赛事已经逐渐形成了一套利益分配链。当地政府有了知名度，主办方拿到了广告赞助费，甚至比赛成绩也传出“内定”疑云。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;舆论场上有声音就质疑说，近些年来“非洲选手包揽国内马拉松赛事前三名”的情况屡见不鲜，背后可能涉及一套灰黑产业链：有“聪明人”瞄准了马拉松赛事的巨额奖金，于是前往非洲寻找优秀选手，以“中介代理”的名义派这些非洲选手参赛。非洲选手只能拿到一部分奖金，“聪明人”却可以凭借剪刀差从中获取巨额收益，甚至不无与主办方勾结、以“盘外招”保证非洲选手拿冠军的手段。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“引导车挡人”，就有不要人认为有盘外招的嫌疑，目的就是阻挡中国优秀马拉松运动员，保证非洲选手拿到冠军。如果这种嫌疑成立的话，那么涉事主办方岂止是专业性与公平性不足的问题，往深了说甚至涉嫌违劳务欺诈，这对马拉松赛事的伤害将是空前的。如不深入调查，何以杜悠悠之口？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;马拉松毕竟还是一项体育运动，不是什么纯粹为了圈钱挣钱的文旅项目。马拉松为谁而办？当然首先还是要为运动员而办，保障赛事的公平性，提升组织的专业性；其次则是为现场观众而办，至少要对得起他们进场观赛的票钱，不至于让人看了一场“假跑”；最后，马拉松赛事需要服务本地市民，尊重市民的需求。如果做到这些，各地举办的马拉松赛事才算得上是没有背弃体育运动的初心。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据中国马拉松信息平台统计，自2023年1月1日至6月30日，全国共有133场路跑赛事在中国田协备案，其中全程马拉松61场、半程马拉松及其他项目72场。中国田径协会发布的《2019中国马拉松大数据分析报告》也显示，全国337个城市（4个直辖市+333个地级行政区），2019年已有300个城市举办了马拉松规模赛事，占比高达89%。马拉松赛事已经到了“全国开花，无地不办”的程度。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;各地政府热衷办赛，希望借此提升城市形象。不过，屡屡爆出的赛事组织问题显示，各地政府与主办方是时候思考“马拉松为何而办，为谁而办”的问题了，不能再让这项古老的运动变成草台班子唱戏，也不能如此屡屡不把运动员与观众放在心上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 16:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[体验分娩的痛，准爸爸我只坚持了3秒]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259045]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 15:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[狗伤人引发热议，人宠还能和谐共处吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259033]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/20/ckPdktfabP9rKiAV9t3O7w0hZJr34cRkHUaAXyyS.jpg&quot;

She is still in the intensive care unit. The owner of the ferocious dog Criminal enforcement measures have been taken. This incident brought the existential conflict between humans and dogs to the focus of social attention, and triggered widespread discussions: how to defend yourself when vicious dogs attack, what legal basis are there for pets to hurt people, and how to raise dogs in a civilized manner... &quot;Southern People Weekly&quot; Several attorneys and canine behavior experts were interviewed about these hot topics. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Private or sue? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;One late night in February 2021, He Qing (pseudonym), who lives in Chaoyang District, Beijing, was walking his dog in the community when he was suddenly attacked by an unleashed German Shepherd (commonly known as the &quot;black dog&quot;). &quot;back&quot;) fell to the ground. Hei Bei bit He Qing&#39;s left cheek, tearing a hole and causing blood to flow out. At this time, the owner of Heibei arrived in a hurry and immediately sent her to the hospital with He Qing&#39;s husband. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the break between treatments, He Qing’s husband asked the owner of the black back to write a handwritten statement of the situation, explaining the time, place and process of the incident, and attaching a signature. This written record became the key to subsequent legal proceedings. evidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the black-backed owner admitted the fact at the first time, she later regretted it, denying the fact that her dog bit He Qing, and claimed that He Qing was bitten by her dog (Bichon Frize). ) bitten and refused to pay any expenses including medical expenses. Helpless and angry, He Qing decided to use the law to protect her legitimate rights and interests, filed a lawsuit with Beijing Chaoyang Court, and hired lawyer Wang Yandong from Beijing Lianggao Law Firm as her attorney. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawyer Wang obtained key video records such as community and hospital surveillance as evidence, and submitted them to the court together with the defendant&#39;s handwritten description of the situation and other evidence. In the end, the court ruled that the plaintiff He Qing won the case, and the defendant had to pay the plaintiff a total of more than 15,000 yuan, including medical expenses, transportation expenses, nutrition expenses, and mental damage solatium. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawyer Wang specifically mentioned the 5,000 yuan moral comfort payment, &quot;The amount of compensation in this type of infringement cases is usually not very high, but if the infringing party does not recognize the liability or has a very bad attitude, it will cause The victim suffered psychological trauma. I specifically added a claim for emotional consolation to the lawsuit, because my client is a woman, and the injury was to such an important part of the face, which required stitches and long-term surgery. The process of repair and plastic surgery, and the psychological impact of this trauma on a woman cannot be ignored. In the end, the court supported our petition, and this mental comfort payment brought great psychological comfort to my client.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/FxiNfrPjgMQuTgQP3r9vteVtryDT34HY4Zwxxa2q.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/FxiNfrPjgMQuTgQP3r9vteVtryDT34HY4Zwxxa2q.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254740&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Nantong, Jiangsu Province, the police distributed promotional materials to encourage the public to raise dogs in a scientific and civilized manner&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;One and a half years after the incident, He Qing obtained the court judgment in August 2022 and received corresponding compensation. There are still scars on her face. She and the defendant ignored each other when they met in the community. Since the black back raised by the defendant is a prohibited dog in the &quot;Beijing Dog Breeding Management Regulations&quot;, it was sent away after the incident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Lawyer Wang, in reality, there are not many people like He Qing who end up in the litigation process because raising animals causes damage to the parties. “If the other party does not regret it midway, but actively apologizes, Negotiating compensation will most likely not lead to litigation. This is because the economic and time costs of going through judicial procedures are relatively high. Many parties drop out or stop litigation because they are tired of litigation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When encountering such incidents , should the two parties resolve it through negotiation or resort to public power for judgment? Lawyer Du Jiahong, a partner at Beijing Xinglai Law Firm, believes that when criminal liability is not involved, it mainly depends on whether the two parties have reached an agreement on the understanding of the infringement (including the cause of the infringement and the damage results) and the handling results. &quot;It causes a tenth-level disability, but if the offending party has a good attitude and actively compensates, the two parties may reach an agreement. However, if they cannot reach an agreement for several thousand yuan, they may also file a lawsuit.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawyer Wang suggested When such infringement occurs, evidence must be obtained as soon as possible and the evidence must be fixed first. &quot;When the infringement first occurs, the resistance and alertness of the relevant party may not be very strong. Regarding some facts, he may admit that this The infringed party must fix the evidence for later use in defending rights. The focus of filing a lawsuit in court to defend rights is the evidence. If the evidence is not fully fixed in the early stage, once the infringer retorts or does not admit the facts later, it will be This causes greater difficulties in safeguarding rights. There are many ways to obtain evidence, such as video, recording, signing a written agreement recognized by both parties, etc. When necessary, relevant surveillance can be obtained through the public security organs.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/hYIaK5IAlfTdL03KKUiscAchU02wgNux3iprwdDw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot; //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/hYIaK5IAlfTdL03KKUiscAchU02wgNux3iprwdDw.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254736&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A golden retriever is undergoing a scare test - screening out dogs prone to excessive fear, aggression or over-excitability of running, screaming, over-enthusiastic people.

Articles 1,245 to 1,247 of this article clarify the liability for harm caused by raising animals. General regulations, liability for damage caused by failure to take safety measures for animals in violation of regulations, and liability for damage caused by dangerous animals that are prohibited from being raised. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“A dog bites a person essentially because of the inappropriate behavior of the animal’s breeder or manager (not tying the leash, not closing the door, etc.), causing damage to other people’s rights to life, health, and body rights. Such illegal behavior should bear corresponding liability for compensation. However, if it can be proved that the damage was caused intentionally by the infringed party, its liability can be reduced,&quot; said Lawyer Wang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to lawyer Du, according to data provided by the China Judgments Network, three years since the official implementation of the Civil Code on January 1, 2021, only 100,000 judgments have been made nationwide on animal damage liability disputes. &quot;This data may not be completely accurate, but the number of such cases nationwide in three years is in the order of thousands, which shows that the number of cases is relatively small. What is this concept? Taking the Beijing area as an example, according to China According to the Judgment Documents Network, there have been more than 30,000 marriage and family dispute cases in the past three years,&quot; said lawyer Du. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But this does not mean that the probability of such incidents happening in reality is small. &quot;(It&#39;s just that) most of them will be resolved through negotiation or mediation.&quot; Attorney Du shared a mediation case she has handled. In a community in Beijing, a mother and daughter were playing on the lawn. The mother turned her back to answer the phone. When the daughter saw a puppy not far away, she broke away from her mother&#39;s hand and wanted to see the dog. As soon as the mother let go and before the girl took a step, the puppy rushed towards the girl and scratched her right arm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The examination fees, medical fees, vaccination fees, nutrition fees, transportation fees, etc. incurred by medical treatment total about 4,000 yuan. The dog owner did not want to pay compensation. He believed that the main cause of the injury was the failure of parents to take good care of their children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the dispute occurred, Lawyer Du intervened in the relevant mediation. &quot;I would like to tell the dog owner, first of all, you did not put a leash on the dog and lead it, which is a violation of the Beijing Dog Breeding Management Regulations. Unless the offended person was intentional, he should bear full responsibility. Secondly, the little girl was not separated from her mother at the time. The scope of care was that the little girl was suddenly jumped three or four meters away from the dog. The little girl was not exposed to a dangerous environment due to her own reasons, but was harmed due to the dog&#39;s pounce behavior in a relatively safe state. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/GqQFhDEKTz7b1rnqn5pxiC9tixWO2rqxvUrqSIaa.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/GqQFhDEKTz7b1rnqn5pxiC9tixWO2rqxvUrqSIaa.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254735&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Beijing, citizens holding dogs walking in the rain&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Liang Chen/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;In the end, the dog owner fully compensated the medical expenses and also paid the mother’s lost work wages. After the incident, the girl was frightened and did not go to school for a week, and her mother accompanied her all day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to lawyer Du’s recollection, the incident took place in a high-end community, and the two parties finally negotiated the amount of compensation in a friendly atmosphere. “These few thousand yuan may not be very large in the eyes of the parties involved. The number, but this mother hopes to establish a correct value for her children - what is right and what is wrong, one day you bully others, you have to compensate. When you are bullied, you must take up the weapon of justice, the law. At the same time, she also Teach children not to actively provoke animals.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawyer Du also mediated an animal injury dispute that had entered into litigation. A medium-sized dog without a leash bit a small dog that was on a leash while walking. Because the owner of the small dog kicked the medium-sized dog while protecting his own dog, he was also scratched. The infringed party filed a claim of nearly 10,000 yuan. Finally, through the mediation of lawyer Du, the two parties reconciled, and the infringing party compensated several thousand yuan, most of which was used for the medical care of small dogs. &quot;For this type of tort liability incident, the losses caused to people and property fall within the scope of rights protection. Therefore, it is not just dog bites that require compensation, but also dog bites.&quot; Lawyer Du analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/RlFJGgpVB32COdu2c1JWfWyZvxXIbVVF871eKyvY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/RlFJGgpVB32COdu2c1JWfWyZvxXIbVVF871eKyvY.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254738&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guangzhou, Guangdong, citizens walking their dogs encountered a robot dog&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Zheng Jie/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Humans and pets coexist harmoniously&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;How to avoid being attacked by dogs? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Qi, a canine behavior expert and senior pet trainer, divides people&#39;s defense against dogs into two situations: one is when walking normally and seeing loose dogs, pedestrians should try to avoid interacting with dogs. Look at each other, keep walking normally (don’t tiptoe, don’t shout loudly, etc.), don’t approach or drive it away, and avoid irritating it; if we encounter the situation where a girl in Chongzhou is actively attacked by a dog, we should use the effective tools around us in time - Use bricks, wooden sticks, umbrellas, etc. to drive away dogs. Wu Qi watched the live video circulated on the Internet, and he pointed out that the mop in the cleaning lady&#39;s hand played a key role in driving away the attacking black Rottweiler. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Wu Qi, there are some emergency treatment methods when encountering a dog attack, such as quickly taking off your clothes, wrapping them in one of your hands, and using this hand to block the attraction. Dog attacks, this can maximize the protection of important parts such as the neck and head. If a man with certain strength is attacked, you can try to use a leash to strangle the dog&#39;s neck to make it feel suffocated and loosen its mouth, or use your fingers to dig its eyes to temporarily lose its ability to attack. &quot;In an emergency like this, the focus must be on human life safety. We drive the dogs away within a reasonable range, but we should not be overly defensive.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to prevent such an incident from happening again? Obviously not everyone can solve this problem by just carrying a stick around. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/T9RgDrhnPcaH1n0vRvboqP9lTulrw4JYrt5rP4IO.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/T9RgDrhnPcaH1n0vRvboqP9lTulrw4JYrt5rP4IO.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254739&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hangzhou, Zhejiang, citizens queue up to apply for certificates with their pets at the dog approval window&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;Wu Qi himself has more than 30 years of experience in raising dogs and has been engaged in pet training for 17 years. He said that the vicious dog injury incident in Chongzhou was &quot;a murder caused by a dog, which caused anxiety among parents with children. Dog parents are also anxious, and it has even turned into a confrontation between dog owners and non-dog owners.” Wu Qi believes that understanding between groups should be enhanced and barriers eliminated. “First of all, we must know that this is not a dog problem, but a problem of individual uncivilized dog owners. As pet owners, while we enjoy the right to keep pets, we must try not to infringe on them. Others - In addition to keeping the dog leash in accordance with regulations and cleaning up pet excrement in a timely manner, if you take your dog in an elevator and encounter a lot of people or people who are obviously afraid of dogs, you should take the initiative to avoid it and wait for the next one; when walking your dog Keep a distance from the elderly and children, and keep the dog calm... In addition, we need to know more about our dog and take it to do some necessary obedience and socialization training. We must invest time and energy and take it to the suburbs to be pet-friendly. Run in the park green space to release their energy. Daily walks and socialization should also allow them to gradually transition from an environment with relatively low pressure to an environment with many people and high pressure.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;In Wu Qi’s view, keeping pets is a way of life for modern people. It can liberate people from stressful work conditions, add a living atmosphere to the family, and is also a manifestation of love for life. People who don’t own pets should be understanding. Pet owners must learn correct and scientific pet-raising concepts and management methods. People who do not keep pets but like small animals must also learn the correct way to interact with small animals. They must obtain the owner&#39;s consent before touching pets and understand the preferences of pets. , Are there any places that are sensitive and inappropriate to touch? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/qyKoggwme4hCUczK1wXYBRIq6jYbtCfgebgLo62R.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/qyKoggwme4hCUczK1wXYBRIq6jYbtCfgebgLo62R.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254737&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Dogs and owners waiting to be evaluated as therapy dogs.

For example, the elderly with dementia, autistic children, physically disabled people, patients with depression, and youth groups on campus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Therapy Dog has been established for more than ten years and has served more than 100,000 people in more than ten cities across the country. So far, there has not been a single incident of a dog hurting anyone. In addition to therapy dogs, there are also guide dogs, etc. &quot;Other working dogs are silently helping humans.&quot; Wu Qi regards creating a harmonious social environment with pets as the key to resolving conflicts. &quot;Including these dogs in the family, their companionship brings indescribable happiness and joy to people.&quot; Comfort.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[人类的智商正在逐年下降？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258947]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In 1978, in order to write a book to refute the so-called &quot;white people are superior to other races&quot;, American scholar James Flynn The study of human IQ began. His original plan was to just flip through the information and quote a few pages from the book. However, after reviewing a large amount of literature, Flynn was surprised to notice that Americans&#39; performance on IQ tests continued to improve over time: According to records from 1932 to 1978, the average American IQ increased in 46 years scored 13.8 points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The apparent increase in IQ scores over several generations seems unlikely to be caused by genetic evolution. Flynn therefore suspected that this must be caused by changes in environmental factors, meaning that IQ is influenced more by the environment than by genetics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To test his conjecture, Flynn expanded his research to 14 countries, including all races. The results found that IQ scores in 14 countries have improved over time over the past half century. Among them, East Asia has the fastest growth, and the average IQ in East Asia is higher than that in Europe and the United States. The IQ of humans around the world is increasing over time. This discovery was called the &quot;Flynn effect&quot; by later scholars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Flynn himself believes that there are no genetic differences in intelligence between races, and that intelligence is affected by environmental factors such as education, economy, and social culture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, various countries have followed up and conducted studies, all of which have confirmed that the Flynn Effect does exist. However, by the end of the twentieth century, the Flynn Effect suddenly failed in developed countries. Statistics from the University of Vienna in Austria found that between 1962 and 1975, the growth rate of average IQ slowed down significantly; and between 1975 and 1991, it directly stagnated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At first, scholars thought this was a normal phenomenon: the average IQ in developed countries may have reached the upper limit and will no longer increase with the improvement of education and medical care; but the IQ in developing countries is still rising, and finally Countries will reach a level close to each other. However, as I continued to record, I found that the average IQ in developed countries has not stagnated, but has begun to regress! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2016, a joint survey by Finland and Denmark found that since the mid-1990s, the IQ test scores of recruits in the two countries have been declining at an average annual rate of 0.25%. In fact, as early as 2008, a British scholar discovered that the average score of 14-year-old British teenagers on thinking tests at that time was only equivalent to that of 12-year-old children in 1976. They believed that &quot;the intelligence of British young people has regressed greatly. It is almost certainly due to the popularity of televisions and computer games, as well as too frequent exams in schools.&quot; But this reason is far-fetched. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The famous scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot; published a paper in 2016: A research team discovered a gene that is highly related to academic qualifications. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They first studied high-educated people and low-educated people, and found that there was a significant frequency difference in this genotype between the two groups. This genotype was then used to predict the future education level of the child, and the results were verified more accurately. Exactly how this genotype affects brain development remains unclear. However, another large study of more than 100,000 people in Iceland showed that this gene may affect the age of childbearing, thereby indirectly affecting the level of education. However, how it affects the age of childbearing is still unknown. It is very likely that Still an indirect effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, regardless of the mechanism of action, the research team discovered a serious problem:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This genotype has been eliminated from generation to generation among Icelanders. In other words, the educational level of the new generation may continue to decline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because people with a high level of education will delay the age of marriage and childbirth, the number of children will decrease, and they will even end up not getting married and having children, and they will eventually eliminate themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although analyzed on a ten-year basis, the influence of genes is still very small and almost negligible: the continuous decrease of this &quot;reading gene&quot; among Icelanders is speculated to cause the average IQ of Icelanders to drop every ten years. The annual decrease was 0.04. If all genes related to education conform to this rule, then this number is only 0.3 - which seems to be nothing compared to the improvement in IQ brought about by acquired environmental improvements such as education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, environmental improvements such as universal education have limits. The elimination of genes from generation to generation is eternal, so that the research team also warned: &quot;If this situation continues for centuries, the consequences will be very serious.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This research in Iceland has not yet been carried out. It has been verified in other groups, but the problem suggested by the study is very general:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Humans around the world, especially those in areas with higher education levels, are likely to face this problem - it seems that smart people are constantly Self-elimination. Of course, the concept of &quot;higher education level&quot; seems to require further analysis: is it longer years of education, higher academic qualifications, or both? Is it the values ​​instilled in them during their education that affect their desire to have children and their fertility rate? This requires further research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 13:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
