They have to read the first few words and know how to start writing the question.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;The child is tired, and so is Liangmei, who accompanies the child in class and helps with homework. &quot;I think this (question solving) is meaningless and the children are not happy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2023, Liangmei flew directly from Shanghai to Toronto, Canada with her two children, becoming one of the hundreds of thousands of overseas families accompanying her students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, the age of international students has gradually become younger, and more overseas mothers have appeared. As women born in the 1980s and 1990s become a new generation of study mothers, they pay more attention to their self-worth and are no longer limited to the traditional &quot;full-time nanny&quot; status. Instead, they explore new paths in life and grow with their children. They are also more tolerant of their children&#39;s futures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liangmei said, &quot;When I take my child out now, it is actually equivalent to giving him an extra chance. Their future life will ultimately be decided by themselves.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot; http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/uJjQW3RHFwjjB7Hl1xIpt2x8koF923OUTRFdY8DU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1266&quot; height=&quot;1648&quot; data-src=&quot;//images. infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/uJjQW3RHFwjjB7Hl1xIpt2x8koF923OUTRFdY8DU.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252245&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>; In July 2023, Shanghai mother Liangmei and her two daughters started studying abroad in Canada. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Yes&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong >;Accompanying&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;,&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Not accompanying students&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the past, accompanying mothers gave people a slightly “sad” impression &quot;: She quit her job for the sake of her children, sacrificed herself, went to a foreign country to take care of her children&#39;s food, clothing, housing and transportation, and became a &quot;full-time nanny&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, young mothers accompanying students do not agree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I didn’t accompany him to study, I just accompanied him.” Nanjing mother Qiao Ya is a post-80s student who has been studying with him in California, USA for many years. Currently, her son has successfully completed junior high school and high school and entered university. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiao Ya said that some young international students will complain to their parents. For example, &quot;You don&#39;t understand&quot; and &quot;You haven&#39;t studied in the United States.&quot; However, this problem does not exist in her communication with her son, because she herself also &quot;study&quot; in the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2021, Qiao Ya’s previous company dismissed a group of employees due to structural adjustments, and she was also on the disbanded list. Frustrated, Qiao Ya decided to go back to school to study for an MBA. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After graduating from college, studying for an MBA was Qiao Ya’s “unfulfilled dream.” The high-value MBA is also a &quot;shortcut&quot; to quickly integrate into the local area and enhance competitiveness in the workplace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the application process, Qiao Ya retrieved her scores from China, commissioned an agency to translate them into English, found someone to write letters of recommendation, and took the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), etc. This is no small challenge for her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2021, Qiao Ya was successfully admitted to the University of California, Irvine. &quot;Although (the process) was extremely difficult,&quot; the result pleased her. &quot;I proved myself and realized my dream.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiao Ya will graduate from MBA in June 2024, while her son will graduate from college in June 2026. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;We are both in sync. He chooses courses and I choose courses; he pays tuition and I pay tuition; he takes holidays and I take holidays. At the same time, he also feels that his mother is very pursuing, which also plays a role for him. It serves as a role model,&quot; Qiao Ya said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiao Ya shared her dream-realization experience on social platforms, which attracted many likes in the circle of accompanying mothers. She believes that every woman has her own strengths. Whether you are good at cooking or gardening, you must realize your potential and see your own value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;40-year-old women are also an integral part of society. Since we have such talents, why should we waste ourselves? Everyone is worthy of appreciation, and I want to arouse such a consensus.&quot; Qiao Ya said . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar &quot;self-awareness&quot; also appears in other mothers who accompany them to study. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/GyM95tw4e84gvYrIxbx8UyWB6sTHOSazBpnx7EEM.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/GyM95tw4e84gvYrIxbx8UyWB6sTHOSazBpnx7EEM.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252247&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In Yerevan, Armenia, Haili&#39;s 6-year-old daughter Mu En (second from left) takes various courses such as figure skating, violin, and rhythmic gymnastics. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hai Li is a post-85s generation, born in Yueyang, Hunan. She loves traveling and has traveled to more than 20 countries around the world. Just a hundred days after her daughter was born, Haili took ID photos and went through the procedures for leaving the country for her daughter who was still unable to sit still. The next day after receiving the documents, the two flew directly to Thailand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hai Li doesn’t like the arranged life, and traveling overseas is her “9 to 5”. Haili and her daughter came to Armenia two years ago and chose to settle in the capital, Yerevan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Haili calls this period of time an accumulation period for her and her daughter. On the one hand, her daughter can learn figure skating, music and dance here at very low cost, and she herself is also learning foreign languages, accumulating industry experience and preparing for a new job. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This does not mean stability. I have my own living situation.&quot; Haili said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;More cost-effective than domestic&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Speaking of When studying abroad, the key word that flashes in many people&#39;s minds is &quot;expensive&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the interviewed mothers of accompanying students said that compared with the high cost of education in domestic cities, overseas accompanying students are more cost-effective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shanghai mother Liangmei applied for a public school in Toronto, Canada for her children. Currently, both children are international students, and the tuition fee is about 80,000 yuan per year. In Liangmei’s hometown of Shanghai, tuition fees for international schools have been priced at RMB 200,000-300,000 per year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liangmei said that she plans to apply for graduate school in Canada. &quot;If I can apply to school and get a study permit or work permit, my children can study in public schools here for free.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you choose to study in a developing country, the cost of accompanying you will further increase. compression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Ying was once a chicken mother in Dongcheng District, Beijing. Her eldest son&#39;s &quot;chicken baby&quot; experience left her physically and mentally exhausted, and she decided not to suffer the &quot;second crop crime&quot; again. In 2017, Liu Ying took her daughter to Johor Bahru, Malaysia, and enrolled in a local international school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Ying said that when she first arrived in Johor Bahru, her daughter’s annual tuition fee was about 6,000 yuan, which was lower than the monthly fee for her daughter’s public kindergarten in Beijing. Currently, my daughter is in seventh grade, and the tuition fee is about 30,000 yuan per year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in international schools, the higher the grade, the more expensive the tuition is. If the daughter goes to grade 10-12 (equivalent to domestic high school), the cost may rise to RMB 130,000-150,000 per year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Ying reminded that the cost of studying abroad varies from person to person, and developing countries are not synonymous with &quot;cheap&quot;. The order of tuition fees for studying in Malaysia is: private schools >; Chinese schools >; public schools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, locals in Malaysia can study for free in government schools, while only those with good family conditions send their children to international schools. &quot;A friend just transferred his child to an American school. Even the school bus costs 1,800 yuan per month.&quot; Liu Ying said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different from the &quot;private elite&quot; and &quot;direct access to Europe and the United States&quot; routes for middle-class families, there are also families who choose the &quot;niche&quot; education route. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/MJ4s2ihpFSYpKDPHowbLkLezeKSBQznqPk1TwPxn.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/MJ4s2ihpFSYpKDPHowbLkLezeKSBQznqPk1TwPxn.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252248&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;July 16, 2023 is the Armenian Water Splashing Festival. Haili’s daughter Mu En (first from right) plays with local children. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Haili said that the reason for choosing Armenia is that Armenia has low entry threshold. Foreigners do not need to purchase real estate, deposit funds, etc. to apply for a residence permit. On the other hand, compared with the same training programs in China, the education fees here are simply &quot;cabbage prices&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, Haili has enrolled her 6-year-old daughter in a number of courses - including figure skating, violin, rhythmic gymnastics, etc. According to her, the monthly group class fees for these courses range from 200 to 400 yuan, and the courses include 8 to 12 classes. If you ask for one-on-one private tutoring, the cost is 100-200 yuan/session. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thanks to the educational &quot;legacy&quot; left by the former Soviet Union, Armenia has rich educational resources and many cultural and sports projects are very strong. Take figure skating as an example. The ice rink where Haili&#39;s daughter learns figure skating attracts figure skaters for training every summer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Trusova, who won the runner-up in single figure skating at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, has been here many times, and Haili’s daughter once took a photo with her. The group classes here only cost about 220 yuan per month. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If we were in China, we might not even have enough ice rink tickets.&quot; Haili said with a smile. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;The most feared thing is&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;sickness and accidents&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p >;When the decision to study abroad is made, the division of labor among the families accompanying the students is mostly similar - the mother goes abroad to accompany the student while the father stays to earn money. In daily life, most fathers contact their wives and children through Internet phone calls. Only during holidays can the two places get together &quot;flyingly&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the mothers accompanying them, this division of labor is partly because women participate in more family childcare work and have more advantages in taking care of children. On the other hand, it is related to local immigration policies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Ying said that in Malaysia, accompanying visas are only issued to female immediate family members. “So most of the people I see accompanying young international students here are mothers or grandmothers.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a foreign country, the lives of young international students depend entirely on the care of limited elders. Once they get sick or have an accident, the family operation basically stops. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For many years in Malaysia, Liu Ying has met many Chinese mothers who have gone through the same experience, and has also heard many embarrassing stories. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On one occasion, a mother who was accompanying her to school suffered a burglary at home. &quot;The mother and son were sleeping, and suddenly a knife was placed on their necks.&quot; Although no one was harmed in the aftermath, it caused a considerable psychological shadow on the children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another time, a Chinese mother who was studying with her died suddenly in her apartment at night. The next day when the child was preparing to go to school with others, he was discovered by other Chinese mothers. Liu Ying said that because the father of the child could not enter the country for a while, the funeral arrangements for the deceased mother relied on the help of other Chinese accompanying mothers. After the father&#39;s emergency visa was issued, the child was safely brought back to the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The biggest fear for mothers who study abroad is illness and accidents, and a string in their minds is extremely tight. Occasionally, when you return to China, you are more likely to get sick. That’s because the string finally has a chance to loosen. &quot;Liu Ying said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before leaving for Canada, Shanghai mother Liangmei brought enough medicine. She said, &quot;I brought all kinds of medicines that I could foresee, such as cold medicines, antibiotics, etc.&quot; Even so, not long after arriving in Canada, Liangmei went to see a doctor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“My waist flashed and I always felt uncomfortable. Later, accompanied by my friends, I decided to see a doctor.” Liangmei said that she went to a clinic at that time. &quot;The whole process can be communicated with the doctor in normal language, and it is not as complicated as I imagined.&quot; However, Liangmei is worried that if she encounters a &quot;big trouble&quot; like a child with a fever in the future, she will still feel uneasy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Families who have the conditions will also choose to have their parents study with them at the same time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Zhang Xinhe, a mother from Guangzhou, is engaged in the cosmetics industry in China. Because her child went to study abroad, they also went to Vancouver and Kuala Lumpur to accompany her. Zhang Xin believes that the company of parents is conducive to the growth of children. If only the mother accompanies the child to study, it will not only be detrimental to the growth of the child, but will also cause many family conflicts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, no matter how thorough the accompanying plan is, the many differences between Chinese and Western education will still bring challenges. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xin’s children previously studied in a public school in Vancouver, Canada, with annual tuition fees of about 90,000 yuan. But &quot;there is almost no hardware&quot;: in Zhang Xin&#39;s words, &quot;the school has no protective fences or security guards, and the door is open, making people feel insecure.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The local concept of happy education also makes Zhang Xin anxious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“In the first few months when my child went to school, the teacher had been teaching the ABC letters. After the child came home, I asked her what she did all day, and she said that the teacher kept asking us to play. It rains often in winter in Canada. When it snows, children often have snowball fights on the playground,&quot; Zhang Xin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the influence of many factors, Zhang Xin decided to transfer her child to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to study in a private international school. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“The future is open”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In Johor Bahru, Malaysia, Liu Ying’s daughter speaks three languages ​​on a daily basis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I speak Chinese at home, English at school, and I need to speak a few words of Malay when I go shopping.” There are also many young international students from South Korea and Japan in local international schools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to experience a better English-speaking environment in Toronto, Canada, Liangmei moved her children from the multi-ethnic city center to the suburbs where whites are relatively concentrated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the families interviewed, the young international students generally left China when they were in primary school or junior high school, and their ages ranged from 6 to 13 years old. Before their values ​​and worldview have yet to be formed, it is easier for them to master a new language and experience the collision of different cultures. However, in a &quot;multilingual growing up&quot; environment, you sometimes face unexpected &quot;conflicts.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xin said that many young international students in Canada receive English education locally, but when they grow up, they cannot speak Chinese well, &quot;let alone write.&quot; Among the many reasons why Zhang Xin decided to transfer her children to another school, &quot;preventing them from forgetting their mother tongue&quot; was one of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the young international students grow up, their future development paths are also put on the agenda. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, some families accompanying students would pass the Overseas Chinese Student Joint Entrance Examination to allow their children to return to the mainstream domestic education system and obtain admission to key universities at a lower threshold. However, Liu Ying felt that this path was not easy to follow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We will basically not consider the joint entrance examination for overseas Chinese students, because the possibility of policy changes is quite high.” Liu Ying believes that the era of using studying abroad as a springboard and trying to overtake in corners has passed, and small students Parents of international students also do not let their children study. &quot;I have to pay such a high price to accompany them to study. I don&#39;t want to just get a diploma.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Ying’s daughter is currently in seventh grade in Malaysia, and she has an open mind about her daughter’s future. &quot;Currently, many Chinese in Malaysia and Singapore have immigrated to various parts of the world. They have a more open mind, a broader vision, and are willing to go further. In fact, this is worth learning from us.&quot; Liu Ying said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiao Ya hopes that after her son graduates from an American university, he will continue to apply for graduate studies at an American “Ivy League school”. As for the development after graduate school, it is up to my son to decide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Children’s roots are still in China, whether it is cultural roots, emotions, or social ties.” Qiao Ya believes that foreign humanistic environments play a great role in children’s growth (this points also apply to adults). But no matter where they are, children and adults need to gradually mature their minds and stabilize their foundations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Essentially, the world is the same, and there are beautiful places. It depends on how you shape your own life.&quot; Qiao Ya said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/1UXoq3AssTQKjlb96CDRWXJ2xzpTQBjYkZfPom8Y.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1257&quot; height= &quot;942&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/1UXoq3AssTQKjlb96CDRWXJ2xzpTQBjYkZfPom8Y.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252246&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Shanghai mother Liangmei said that children&#39;s independence and hands-on ability have been improved by studying and living overseas. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liangmei has just arrived in Toronto and has not yet made precise plans for the future of her children. However, she made it clear that she would not force her children to go to prestigious schools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She also hopes that children can &quot;experience multiculturalism, have a broader vision and strong social practice ability.&quot; Liangmei also pointed out that Canada has a lot of demand for technical and service blue-collar jobs, such as electricians, veterinarians, dental assistants, etc. Blue-collar jobs are equally respectable and pay well. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This is different from China. People don’t think that studying is the only way.” Liangmei said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Liangmei, Qiao Ya, Liu Ying, and Zhang Xin are pseudonyms)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 15:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[山西大同涉性霸凌事件触目惊心：强制专门矫治应尽快落地丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257752]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The recent campus bullying incident at Dacheng Bilingual School in Datong, Shanxi has aroused extreme concern on the Internet, especially among parents. Big attention. On September 26, the Datong City Joint Investigation Team reported that it was confirmed that two 9-year-old male students &quot;repeatedly committed serious bad behaviors such as insults, beatings, and bullying&quot; against another male student in the same dormitory. The offender &quot;will be reprimanded in accordance with the law and ordered to receive psychological counseling and behavioral modification&quot;, and his or her guardian &quot;will be reprimanded and ordered to receive family education guidance&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This official notification did not calm public opinion, but instead caused greater controversy, because the punishment for the two bullies was too light, and it was not even a punishment at all. The vague statement in the official report that &quot;repeatedly committed insults, beatings, bullying and other serious bad behaviors&quot; is actually so shocking that even adults can&#39;t imagine it. It is difficult to recount, but I can only say that in addition to long-term insults and beatings, it also included serious personal insults and sexual assaults. If these acts were committed by adults, they would undoubtedly constitute the crime of child molestation. Given the severity of the circumstances and the severity of the impact, they would likely be sentenced to the fullest possible sentence. If the victim is a girl, it is a crime of rape of a young girl, and the death penalty may not be an exaggeration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The difference in punishment caused by the age difference between the perpetrators has been a matter of widespread public concern for a long time. Two little boys committed such serious crimes, but because they were only 9 years old, their punishment could only be &quot;admonishment, forced psychological counseling and behavioral modification.&quot; How can such a painless treatment comfort the victims? This is unacceptable to the public. However, according to a well-known police influencer, &quot;At this age, it really can only be like this.&quot; Is the law really powerless against young devils? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the purpose of &quot;protecting minors&quot;, China&#39;s criminal law does stipulate that minors under a certain age who commit crimes will not be held criminally responsible. Before the 11th Amendment to the Criminal Law comes into effect, minors who are over 14 years old and under 16 years old are only required to bear criminal responsibility when they commit eight serious crimes. Those under 14 years old are not criminally responsible for any crime they commit. . Even though the Criminal Law Amendment (11) stipulates that those who are over 12 years old but under 14 years old can be held criminally responsible for intentional homicide or intentional injury if the circumstances are serious and the impact is serious, but those under 12 years old are still absolutely exempt from criminal liability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the previous criminal law also stipulated that those who are not subject to criminal punishment due to age can, in addition to ordering their guardians to discipline them, also be &quot;cused and educated by the government&quot; when necessary. In 2019, after the C&amp;E system was abolished, the new criminal law changed this to &quot;specialized correctional education in accordance with the law.&quot; The new law on the prevention of juvenile delinquency makes specific provisions on this type of specialized correctional education: If a minor commits an act stipulated in the criminal law and is not subject to criminal punishment because he is under the legal age of criminal responsibility, the education administration shall, upon evaluation and approval by the Specialized Education Steering Committee, The department, together with the public security organ, may decide to provide special correctional education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;specialized correctional education&quot; here is compulsory. It only requires the evaluation and approval of the Specialized Education Steering Committee and is decided by the education administration department in conjunction with the public security agency. It does not require the consent of the guardian. The objects of this type of specialized correctional education, even in specialized schools, must receive education in &quot;specialized places.&quot; This specialized place must &quot;implement closed-loop management. The public security organs and judicial administrative departments are responsible for the correction of minors. The education administrative department shall be responsible for the education of minors.” There is no age limit for the subjects of this kind of specialized correctional education, and there is no &quot;no less than 12 years old&quot; rule mentioned by the aforementioned big V. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, there are no legal provisions for the treatment of young serious offenders. Although being sent to a specialized school for correctional education is not a criminal punishment, it is at least much stronger than indifferent treatments such as &quot;reprimands and orders to undergo behavior modification.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in reality, these legal provisions are rarely applied. The first reason is that there are few specialized schools, and the second reason is that most places have not yet established corresponding departments and procedures. According to research data from the Ninth Procuratorate of the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, which is responsible for the prosecution of minors, as early as 2019, the central government proposed that &quot;local governments at or above the county level should reasonably set up specialized schools according to needs.&quot; However, as of May 2022, there are only There are more than 110 schools, and 9 provinces have no specialized schools, and many provinces and even the most populous provinces only have one specialized school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, there are many minors who need to receive such &quot;specialized correctional education&quot;. According to data from the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, in 2021, procuratorial organs in various regions, in collaboration with relevant departments, sent 2,159 minors who had committed crimes to vocational schools for correctional education. Hainan Daily also reported a few days ago that 4 specialized schools have been built in Hainan province, and have admitted 276 students in the first eight months of 2023 (the report did not specify how many of these students were forced to receive specialized correctional education in accordance with the law). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Insufficient places and institutions leave many delinquent minors who should be forced to receive &quot;specialized correctional education&quot; with nowhere to send them. They can only be &quot;reprimanded&quot; and let go. This may allow some minors to regard the Minors Protection Law as a talisman and engage in illegal and criminal activities without restraint: they will not be severely punished anyway. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to providing powerful &quot;special corrective education&quot; for minors who have committed crimes, their guardians should also pay a greater price for poor education. For example, the amount of “mental damage compensation” in current Chinese legal practice is too low and has been criticized. Judicial practice should greatly increase the upper limit of the amount of mental damage compensation. On the one hand, this can better compensate the victims, and on the other hand, it can also improve the deterrence of illegal crimes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, the protection of minors is not the protection of minors from crime. Only by severely punishing and dealing with minors who break the law and commit crimes can we better reduce minors&#39; violations and crimes and protect more minors. The compulsory specialized correctional education system should be implemented as soon as possible and implemented effectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[为了避世、高考、不流浪……：在鹤岗买房的人]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257724]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[走向抽象化的数学]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257669]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/25/jQiplTYJng0JKlmMwDq1HulW9MYmPLvLsk4KRtjJ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/jQiplTYJng0JKlmMwDq1HulW9MYmPLvLsk4KR tjJ. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252166&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: left;&quot;>;The real counterpart to &quot;abstract algebra&quot; should be &quot;abstract art&quot;, which specifically refers to Those paintings without any identifiable subject, the Russian painter Kandinsky is considered the first &quot;abstract painter&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Set Theory and Axiomatization&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;The changes in geometry and algebra in the 19th century brought rapid development and unprecedented prosperity to mathematics in the 20th century. Modern mathematics is no longer just a few traditional subjects such as geometry, algebra, and analysis. It has become a knowledge system with many branches and a complex structure, and it is still developing and changing. The characteristics of mathematics are not only strict logic, but also add two other characteristics, namely high degree of abstraction and wide application, and thus form two major scopes of modern mathematics research, namely pure mathematics and applied mathematics. Some of the latter developed the computer, which, apart from its importance, has provided more employment to mankind than all other branches of mathematics put together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pure mathematics was initially driven by two factors, namely the penetration of set theory and the application of axiomatic methods. Set theory was originally founded by Cantor in the late 19th century. It was opposed by many great mathematicians, including Kronecker. It was later recognized because of its increasingly obvious role in mathematics. Sets were initially built on number sets or point sets, and soon the scope of the definition was expanded to include any set of elements, such as a set of functions, a set of geometric figures, etc. This allows set theory to enter different fields of mathematics as a universal language, causing profound changes in basic concepts such as integrals, functions, and spaces in mathematics. It also stimulates the changes between intuitionism and formalism in mathematical logic that will be discussed in this article. Further development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cantor was a Dane born in St. Petersburg. His Jewish parents did business in Russia when they were young, and their business expanded to Hamburg, London and even New York. Like Kelly, he can be said to be a role model for the children of businessmen outside the country, but Cantor&#39;s grandparents came to St. Petersburg. At the age of 11, Cantor moved to Germany with his parents, where he spent most of his life. He went to high school in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and later went to Zurich, Switzerland, and several universities in Germany. He gradually fell in love with mathematics and decided to make it his career, although his talent in painting once made his family proud. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Cantor&#39;s eyes, a set is a totality of objects, whether they are finite or infinite. When using one-to-one correspondence to study sets, he came to a surprising result: rational numbers are countable, that is, they can correspond to natural numbers one-to-one. At the same time, he proved that all real numbers are uncountable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only that, Cantor also gave a non-constructive proof of the existence of transcendental numbers. In fact, Cantor proved that algebraic numbers are countable just like rational numbers, and that real numbers are uncountable. In this way, since all algebraic numbers and transcendental numbers constitute the real numbers, transcendental numbers not only exist but are much more numerous than algebraic numbers. The study of transcendental numbers later became a landscape of number theory research in the 20th century. However, when Cantor determined that infinity was a real existence, he was opposed and attacked by his colleagues for a long time, especially Kronecker (1823-1891), a Jewish professor at the University of Berlin. The latter was not only an outstanding mathematician but also a successful mathematician. businessman and the most powerful fighter in scientific debates, while Cantor was so weak and incompetent that he spent his entire life as a professor at a third-rate university, although the truth was on his side. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cantor introduced the theory of cardinal numbers to set theory, calling the cardinal number of all integers Alev zero, and calling the subsequent larger cardinal numbers Alev one, Alev two, and so on ( Aleph is a Hebrew letter and Cantor is also Jewish). That is, he classified the infinite. He also proved that the cardinality of the entire set of real numbers is greater than Alev zero. This leads to the so-called Cantor continuum hypothesis: there is no other cardinality between Aleph zero and the cardinality of all real numbers. At the beginning of the 20th century, when the German mathematician Hilbert delivered his famous &quot;Mathematical Problems&quot; speech at the World Congress of Mathematicians in Paris, he listed this hypothesis or conjecture at the forefront of the 23 mathematical problems left for the 20th century (Transcendental Number Problem is listed at No. 7). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Cantor discovered that the &quot;mathematical body&quot; was seriously ill and that the disease transmitted to it by Zeno in ancient Greece had not been relieved, he couldn&#39;t help but want to cure it. However, his Promethean attack on the infinite problem caused his own nervous breakdown when he was only 40 years old. He died much later in a mental hospital in central Germany. The year after Hilbert gave his speech, Russell also expressed his views:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Zeno cared about Three problems: infinitesimal, infinite and continuous. The best minds of every generation have tried to solve these problems, but literally, they have gotten nowhere. ...Weierstrass, Dedekind and Cantor solved them thoroughly. Their answers were so clear that they no longer left any doubt. This achievement may be the greatest that this era can boast. ...The problem of infinitesimals was solved by Weierstrass, the solution of the other two problems was started by Dedekind and finally completed by Cantor. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The axiomatic method was summarized by Euclid as early as the ancient Greek era and adopted in his famous work &quot;Elements of Geometry&quot;. As we all know, this book uses 5 postulates and 5 axioms. However, the axiom system proposed by Euclid is not perfect. The German mathematician Hilbert redefined the modern axiomatic method. He pointed out, &quot;Whether these objects are points, lines, surfaces, tables, chairs, or beer glasses, they can all become such geometric objects. For them, , the relationships expressed by the axioms are all true.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take points, lines, and surfaces as examples. Euclid gave these objects descriptive definitions, but in Hilbert&#39;s eyes they are all These are purely abstract objects with no specific concrete content. In addition, Hilbert also examined the interrelationships between the axioms and clearly put forward the basic logical requirements for the axiom system, namely compatibility, independence and completeness. Of course, axiomatization is just a method and is not as rich in content as set theory. Nevertheless, Hilbert&#39;s axiomatic method not only gave geometry a strict logical foundation, but also gradually penetrated into other fields of mathematics, becoming a powerful tool for synthesizing and refining mathematical knowledge and promoting specific mathematical research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hilbert was born in 1861 on the outskirts of Königsberg in East Prussia, which now belongs to the divided Russian territory, surrounded by Poland, Lithuania and the Baltic Sea, and has long been renamed Kaliningrad. Although the greatest citizen born in that city was the philosopher Immanuel Kant (who spent his entire life in this remote city), he had an indissoluble bond with mathematics. It turns out that the Pregel River flowing through the city is divided into two branches. There are seven bridges on the river, five of which connect the river bank to a small island in the river. So a mathematical problem arises. Suppose that a person can only cross each bridge. Can you cross all seven bridges once? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This seemingly simple problem later became the starting point of topology and was solved by the Swiss mathematician Euler. However, it was a boy from the same city who was two years younger than him, Hermann Minkowski (1864-1909), who directly guided Hilbert firmly on the path of mathematics. Hermann was born in Kaunas, Russia (now Lithuania), and moved to Königsberg with his family when he was 8 years old, just across the river from Hilbert&#39;s family. This talented Jewish boy won the Mathematics Prize of the Paris Academy of Sciences just after he turned 18. His 6-year-old brother Oscar is the &quot;father of insulin&quot; and discovered the connection between insulin and diabetes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Associating with such a peerless talent, Hilbert&#39;s talent was not only not buried, but was honed and hoarded, prompting him to work quietly and lay a more solid foundation. The friendship between the two men (who later became brothers) lasted for a quarter of a century, stretching from Königsberg to Göttingen. Minkowski later died young of acute appendicitis, while Hilbert lived to Over eighty years old, he has accomplished the great achievements of a generation of masters. In 1900, Hilbert raised 23 mathematical problems at the World Congress of Mathematicians in Paris, which pointed the direction for the development of mathematics in the 20th century. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Abstraction of mathematics&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The viewpoint of set theory and the axiomatic method gradually became the paradigm of mathematical abstraction in the 20th century. After they are combined with each other, they become more It has the power to lead the development of mathematics to a more abstract path, leading to the rise of the four major branches of abstract mathematics: real variable function theory, functional analysis, topology and abstract algebra in the first half of the 20th century. They can be called the four abstract branches. The flower of mathematics. Interestingly, the five mathematicians mentioned in the previous section (including Kronecker) are all Germans. They may be one of the nations best at abstract thinking. Mathematics is of course the most abstract branch of science, and Germany is also home to a large number of talents whether in the most abstract art - music, or in the most abstract humanities and social sciences - philosophy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The viewpoint of set theory first caused the reform of integral calculus, which led to the establishment of the theory of real variable functions. At the end of the 19th century, the rigor of analysis forced many mathematicians to seriously consider so-called &quot;ill-conditioned functions&quot;, such as the everywhere continuous but everywhere non-differentiable function defined by Weierstrass, and the everywhere defined by Gauss&#39;s student Dirichlet. Discontinuous function.在此基础上，数学家们研究了如何把积分的概念推广到更广泛的函数类。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这方面首先获得成功的是法国数学家勒贝格（1875-1941），他用集合论的方法定义了测度（勒贝格测度）概念，作为原先“长度”概念的推广，建立起了所谓的勒贝格积分，从而把定积分的概念作了推广。在此基础上，利用微分运算与积分运算的互逆性，重建了牛顿和莱布尼茨的微积分基本定理，从而形成了一门新的数学分支——实变函数论。同样，这一新生事物也受到某些数学权威的斥责，勒贝格本人公布结果以后差不多有10年时间找不到工作。今天，人们把勒贝格以前的分析学称为经典分析，而把他以后的分析称为现代分析。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了实变函数论以外，现代分析的另一个重要组成部分是泛函分析。所谓“泛函”可以看作是“函数的函数”，这个词由法国数学家阿达玛（1865-1963，以率先证明数论中的素数定理闻名）引进。不少数学家在泛函分析理论上都有重要建树，其中希尔伯特引进了无穷实数组组成的集合，在定义“内积”等概念和运算之后，他建立了第一个无限维空间，即所谓的希尔伯特空间。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在集合论的观点帮助建立实变函数论和泛函分析的同时，公理化方法也在向数学领域渗透，其中最有代表性的结果是抽象代数的形成。自从伽罗华提出群的概念以后，从有限群、离散群发展到了无限群、连续群。代数对象也在扩大，进一步产生了其他代数系统，如环（ring）、域（field）、格（lattice）、理想（ideal）等。此后，代数学研究的中心就转移到代数结构上，这种结构由集合的元素之间的若干二元合成运算组成，具有以下特点：一是集合的元素必须是抽象的，二是运算是通过公理来规定的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一般认为，德国数学家诺特（1882-1935）在1921年发表的《环中的理想论》是抽象代数的开端，她是这个领域最有创建的数学家之一，她的弟子也遍布世界。诺特被认为是迄今为止最伟大的女数学家，也就是说，超过了在她之前四位著名的女数学家，即古希腊的希帕蒂娅、近代意大利的阿涅西（1718-1799）、法国的热尔曼（1776-1831）和俄国的柯瓦列夫斯卡娅。尽管如此，由于性别歧视，诺特在哥廷根大学很长时间做不上讲师，直到纳粹政府上台，年过半百的她还不是教授，到达美国以后也只是在女子学院任教授。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后，我们要谈的是拓扑学，德裔美国数学家外尔（1885-1955）说过，拓扑天使和代数魔鬼为占有每一块数学地盘展开了壮丽的搏斗。由此可见这两门学科的重要性，相比而言，拓扑学有着比抽象代数更早的渊源和更有趣的例子，比如哥尼斯堡七桥问题（1736）、地图四色问题（1852），以及莫比乌斯带（1858）。拓扑学研究几何图形的连续性质，即在连续变形（拉伸、扭曲但不能割断和粘合）下保持不变的性质，拓扑学这个词是由高斯的一个学生引进的（1847），其希腊文原意是“位置的学问”。虽然最初属于几何学，但其两大分支却分别是代数拓扑学和点集拓扑学。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;点集拓扑又称一般拓扑学，它把几何图形看成是点的集合，同时把整个集合看成是一个空间。数学家们从“邻域”这个概念出发，引进连续、连通、维数等一系列概念，再加上紧致性、可分性和连通性等性质，建立了这门学科。它也有一些有趣的实例，比如，在地球的北极每一个方向是朝南的，这本是经纬度的一种缺陷；地球上任何时刻总是至少有一个地方没有风（台风中心）。这两个完全不同的事实对应于拓扑学中的不动点定理：n维单形到它自身的连续变换至少有一个不动点。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;代数拓扑的奠基人是法国数学家庞加莱，正如墙壁用砖砌成，他将几何图形剖分成有限个相互连接的小图形。他定义了所谓的高维流形、同胚和同调，后来的数学家又发展了同调论和同伦论，并把拓扑问题转化为抽象代数问题。这个领域最早的一个著名定理是由笛卡尔（1635）提出后又被欧拉（1752）发现的，即任何没有洞的多面体的顶点数加上面数再减去棱数等于2。还有一个所谓的庞加莱猜想（1904），即任意一个三维的单连通闭流形必与三维球面同胚。这个猜想曾被悬赏一百万美元以求得证明。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;四维空间是非欧几何学的一种特殊形式，当人们仍在辩论非欧几何学以及违反欧几里得第五公设的哲学后果时，庞加莱是这样教我们想象四维世界的，“外在物体的形象被描绘在视网膜上，这个视网膜是一个二维画；这些形象是一幅透视图……”按照他的解释，既然二维面的一个景象是从三维面而来的投影，那么三维面上的一个形象也可以看成是从四维而来的投影。庞加莱建议，可以将第四维描述成画布上接连出现的不同透视图。依照西班牙画家毕加索的视觉天赋，他认为这不同的透视图应该在时间同时性里展示出来，于是就有了《阿维尼翁少女》（1907）——立体主义的开山之作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;值得一提的是，在《科学与假设》（1902）的众多读者里，有一位叫普兰斯的巴黎保险精算师，在立体主义诞生前夕，他是西班牙画家毕加索的“洗衣舫”艺术家圈子成员。正是在他的引荐下，新几何学成为了“充满热情地探索着的”新艺术语言。毕加索的好友、立体主义的阐释者阿波利奈尔总结道，“第四维不是一个数学概念，而是一个隐喻，它包含着新美术的种子。”在诗人看来，“立体主义用一个无限的宇宙取代了一个以人为中心的有限宇宙。”他还指出，“几何图形是绘画必不可少的，几何学对于造型艺术就如同语法对写作一样重要。”或许我们可以这样认为，立体主义是文艺复兴以来，绘画和几何又一次美妙的邂逅。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;绘画中的抽象&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“抽象”(abstract)这个词作为名词在西文里的意思就是摘要，它常常置于一篇数学论文的开头，在标题、作者姓名和单位下面。在艺术领域，它可以理解成为从自然里提取出来的什么东西。正如集合论这类抽象数学的出现曾经引起一番争议一样，长期以来这个词用在艺术上多少有着贬义的含义，它同时也是一件争论不休的事情。自从亚里士多德以来，绘画和雕塑一直被当成摹仿的艺术看待。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;直到19世纪中叶，艺术家才开始倾向于一种新的艺术观念，即绘画是自身存在的一个实体，并非对别的什么东西的摹仿。后来渐渐产生了这样一种艺术，即主题变成了附属的或弯曲变形了的东西，以便强调造型或表现手段，那是一种不以表现自然为目的的艺术。塞尚可谓是这种艺术的先驱，他发现眼睛是连续而同时地观看一个景色，他对于自然、人以及绘画的观念，全都展现在对故乡普罗旺斯地区的山川、静物和肖像中。对塞尚来说，抽象主要是一种方法，目的在于重建独立绘画的自然景致。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;塞尚（1839-1906）被誉为“抽象艺术之父”或“现代艺术之父”。在他的引导下，19世纪末和20世纪初的艺术家们掀起了一波波现代主义的浪潮，典型的有法国画家马蒂斯（1869-1954）为代表的野兽派和以西班牙画家毕加索为代表的立体主义。可是，这些画家的作品里仍有一点点可以辨认的主题，因此它们只能称为“抽象的”或“半抽象的”艺术。这里，抽象只是个泛泛的形容词，还不是专有的名词。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;真正与“抽象代数”这个数学专用词汇相对应的应该是“抽象艺术”，它专指那些没有任何可以辨认的主题的绘画。俄国画家康定斯基被认为是第一个“抽象画家”。 18世纪以来，彼得大帝和叶卡捷琳娜女皇的俄罗斯，在长期聘请贝努利兄弟和欧拉这样的大科学家的同时，也开始了一种赞助艺术的传统，并与西方不断进行着密切的接触，俄国人经常到法国、意大利和德国等地旅行。进入19世纪以来，俄国的文学和音乐达到了很高的水平，戏剧和芭蕾也取得了长足的进步。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1866年，正好是黎曼去世的那一年，康定斯基出生在莫斯科，几个月以后，波德莱尔也在巴黎去世。康定斯基的父系是来自西伯利亚的茶叶商人，有蒙古贵族的血统，据说他祖母是一位中国的蒙古族公主，而他的母亲则是地地道道的莫斯科人。康定斯基幼时随父母和姨母去意大利旅行，不久迁居黑海之滨的敖德萨（今属乌克兰）。父母离异后他随姨母生活，在敖德萨上完中学，并成为钢琴与大提琴的演奏者和业余画家。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;20岁那年，康定斯基进入莫斯科大学攻读法律和经济学，直至取得博士学位，其间他仍对绘画保持极大兴趣，并在一次去北部的沃洛格达州从事与法律有关的种族史调查时，对当地民间绘画中色彩艳丽的非写实风格发生强烈兴趣。 1896年，30岁的康定斯基立志成为画家，他毅然放弃了莫斯科大学的助理教授职位，前往德国南方，入慕尼黑的一所美术学院学习，四年后才结业，同学中有比他年轻13岁的瑞士人克利（1879-1940），后来他俩携手成为20世纪的绘画大师。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;正是在慕尼黑期间，康定斯基关于非客观物体的或没有实际主题的绘画风格开始形成了。经过一番探索，他找到并确立了自己的艺术目标：通过线条和色彩、空间和运动，不需参照可见的自然物体，来表现一种精神上的反应或决断。早年的法学熏陶也帮助他成为画家中最有理论水平的，在《论艺术的精神》一书里，他谈到从法国印象派画家马奈（1832-1883）的作品里，第一次察觉到物体的非物质化问题，并不断地吸引着他。自然科学中的革命性进展，也粉碎了他对可触摸感知的物理世界所维持的信念。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从康定斯基身上，我们可以感觉到一种神秘主义的内在力量，这是一种精神产品而不是外部景象或手工技巧的产品。他自己这样写道，“色彩和形式的和谐，从严格意义上讲必须是以触及人类灵魂的原则为惟一基础。”在他中年出版的《回忆录》里，也有这样的一段描述：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;留给我最初深刻印象的色彩是明亮的翠绿、白、洋红、黑，以及褐黄。这些回忆可以追溯到三岁的时光。我曾在各种不同的物体上观察它们，如今在我眼中那些物体的形状已经远不如色彩来得清晰了。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随着年龄的增长，康定斯基开始向几何的抽象演变，以圆和三角形为主要形式，这从其作品名字中也可以看出，如《在黑圆圈中》《一个中心》《黄红蓝》《三个声音》。在他晚年出版的理论著作《从点和线到面》中，他甚至分析了图画的抽象因素的想象效果，认为横线表冷、竖线表热。康定斯基是这样一位画家，可能没有一幅特别让人铭记的代表作，但是任何一幅作品都具有鲜明的形象和艳丽的色彩，会让你立刻辨认出，并带给你愉悦或深思。这一点似乎可以说明，抽象艺术（就像非欧几何学）有着更为广阔的表现空间。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了康定斯基以外，抽象艺术的代表画家至少还有他的同胞马列维奇（1878-1935）、荷兰的蒙德里安（1872-1944）和美国的波洛克（1912-1956）。马列维奇把抽象带进一种最后的几何简化中，例如，在一张白方块中画上一个斜的黑边方块。但马列维奇与康定斯基代表了抽象艺术的两个方向，他和同时代的蒙德里安都直接从立体主义那里得到启示；而波洛克则采用了超现实主义的无意识行动技术，创造了在画布甚至汽车引擎盖上滴落与倾倒颜料的技术，他和从荷兰偷渡到美国的德·库宁（1904-1997）是最早扬名世界的新大陆艺术家。 &lt;/p>;

Recently, the Guang&#39;an District Court of Guang&#39;an City, Sichuan Province ordered the daughter and son-in-law to pay 82,500 yuan to the grandmother. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the court, because the child Xiaobao’s mother Hu and father Zhu had been working in Chengdu and were busy with work and had no time to take care of the child, they left Xiaobao in the care of his grandmother Duan. Hu said: She and her husband give her mother 1,000 yuan a month for living expenses and 2,000 yuan for child care. Hu said that he and Duan had signed an agreement on Xiaobao&#39;s custody, but the child&#39;s father did not know about it. When my grandmother tried repeatedly to get her, but to no avail, she filed a lawsuit in court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The court held that Hu and his wife had the rights and obligations to raise, educate, and protect Xiaobao, and were able to earn income through labor and had the ability to support the child. Duan had no legal obligation to support the child, so Hu The couple should pay the grandmother the necessary expenses incurred for daily care and nursing of the baby. However, the child&#39;s father, Zhu, said: The fundamental reason why the old man asked for &quot;child care fees&quot; was that he and the child&#39;s mother had a divorce dispute. &quot;The person she really wants to sue is me.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When a couple divorces, it is not difficult to understand why the elderly come up with unique strategies to obtain more benefits for their children. Of course, there is no problem with the court&#39;s decision. The current Marriage and Family Section of the Civil Code stipulates that both husband and wife jointly bear the obligation to raise, educate and protect minor children (Article 1058); Children and grandchildren have the obligation to support them (Article 1074), which is essentially consistent with the previously applicable marriage law provisions (Articles 21 and 28). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, statutory law and judicial practice now recognize small families, and large families only exist in the sense of customary law. Under normal circumstances, in the sense of statutory law, the elderly have neither any rights nor any responsibilities and obligations towards their small family members. Therefore, for the elderly of either party to help take care of the children is a matter of affection, not a duty. The elderly can choose to take them or not; they can take them voluntarily for free, or they can ask for compensation before or after the event. These are the rights of the elderly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not the first time a similar verdict has been issued. There is a famous case in Nanjing. In 2010, Su married her husband Li. In August 2014, her son was born and was taken care of by her grandmother Fang. In August 2019, the two divorced. In December 2020, the court ruled that the divorce was granted, and the child was raised by Su. On October 10, 2020, Fang sued his daughter and son-in-law, who had not yet divorced at the time, demanding more than 200,000 yuan in childcare fees. The court held that Fang had no obligation to take care of the child and ordered Li to pay a total of more than 160,000 yuan in childcare fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judges have discretion and may make contrary decisions. There is a case in Tai&#39;an, Shandong. Yao married her husband Su in 2013 and had a daughter. The two divorced in 2021. During the marriage, both husband and wife worked, and Grandma Li took care of the children. In 2021, Li sued and demanded that Yao pay 100,000 yuan. The Ningyang County Court held that although the two parties are now divorced, the children still have a close relationship with their parents and ancestors, and the children should not be blamed for their elders&#39; entanglements. &quot;The children should be cared for and will not be supported,&quot; the court said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the elderly&#39;s request for childcare fees is also a natural extension of &quot;housework compensation&quot; and deserves attention and analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In judicial practice, the concept of “housework compensation” often appears in divorce cases. One party works to earn money, creates wealth for the family, and provides transfer payments to those who stay at home full-time and their children; the other party stays at home full-time. According to the community property system, one person will receive half of the property upon divorce. For example, if the property is 2 million, each person will share 1 million. However, according to the idea of ​​&quot;family labor compensation&quot;, full-time earners need to provide some additional money to those who work full-time at home. The logic behind this division is that full-time stay-at-home workers contribute more to the family than full-time earners. Theoretically, because common property itself already means compensation for those who stay at home full-time, the so-called &quot;housework compensation&quot; is actually secondary compensation. Reasonable or not? There was endless debate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In actual divorce cases, one spouse who used to be a good couple can ask for additional &quot;housework compensation&quot; from the other spouse on the grounds that they stay at home full time. Then it would be more reasonable for one or both elderly people to ask for &quot;child care fees&quot; from the small family, because taking care of children is not the responsibility of the elderly in the first place. This is why when there are more and more divorce cases involving &quot;housework compensation&quot;, there are also more and more cases of the elderly asking for &quot;childcare fees&quot;. The two have both a positive correlation and a causal relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, even if it was just a matter of affection, not a duty, to take care of grandchildren in the legal sense, there were very few cases where one or both elderly people asked for &quot;child care fees&quot; from a small family. There were many reasons: or because they were The constraints of traditional extended family concepts and customary laws may be due to fear of hurting the relationship with grandchildren, or &quot;fear of being laughed at by others.&quot; But when a couple is divorcing, one party can ask for &quot;compensation for housework&quot; from the other party, and the constraints on these concepts of the elderly are invisibly relaxed and even disappear; one of the husband and wife may even secretly ask their parents for help, so that they can When an old man sues himself and his spouse, he will argue as much as possible, and &quot;the flesh rots in his own pot.&quot; This is why we are seeing more and more cases and reports like this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[贷中贷，“瑕疵案”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257726]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/26/VZjva2GziqcXupA02j2W8YDlQPOVfdpTWWeaVi6i.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;982&quot; height=&quot;735&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/VZjva2GziqcXupA02j2W8YDlQPOVfdp TWWeaVi6i. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252272&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 19, 2023, today’s Mujiangwang Village, Baqiao District, Xi’an City . &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Zhai Xingli/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past nine years, Shaanxi businessman Hu Xufeng has been involved in 273 lawsuits. The origin of the 273 lawsuits is the urban village reconstruction project of Mujiangwang Village in Baqiao District, Xi&#39;an City that he began to develop in the 2000s. He was only 27 years old when he won this project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Huashang Daily&quot; report, on July 5, 2009, the Xi&#39;an Urban Reform Office released for the first time a list of 83 projects that had obtained the &quot;Approval of the Urban Village Renovation Plan&quot;. In terms of area, the Mujiangwang Village reconstruction project covers an area of ​​785 acres, making it the largest one on the list. Based on the average sales price of commercial real estate surrounding the project, Hu Xufeng estimated that the market value of the project around 2016 was about 4 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the project development process, Hu Xufeng pledged the company&#39;s shares due to two private loans, and therefore lost control of the company. One of them was a cumulative loan of 6 million yuan from Wang Jian, a Zhejiang businessman who has lived in Xi&#39;an. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to regain his equity, Hu Xufeng launched a lengthy lawsuit against creditors and administrative agencies, and the lawsuit went all the way to the Supreme People&#39;s Court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, the Supreme People’s Court made a judgment on the civil case involving Hu Xufeng’s party suing Wang Jian, upholding the judgment of the Shaanxi Provincial High Court, but found that the “Shareholders Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement” on January 10, 2012 was illegal. The true expression of intention of the parties does not have the effect of equity transfer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng sued the Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau based on this, petitioning to revoke Wang Jian&#39;s share change registration, but lost both cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng lodged a protest with the procuratorial organ. In July 2020, a prosecutor from the Seventh Procuratorate Department of the Shaanxi Provincial People&#39;s Procuratorate appeared in court to protest. After the protest, Hu Xufeng still lost the case in the retrial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, Hu Xufeng’s opponent, the current shareholder of Hongrun Real Estate, applied to the Xi’an Market Supervision Bureau to change the legal representative, but was also rejected. On August 18, 2023, the Xi&#39;an Railway Transport Intermediate Court made a second-instance judgment. The Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau lost the case. The court ordered it to administratively handle Hongrun Real Estate&#39;s change application within 60 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This means that in this equity war that has lasted for nine years, the administrative agencies involved must make the final decision. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of press time, the Xi’an Market Supervision Bureau had not responded to an interview with a Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Two private loans&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;International Happy City is located in the southeast of Xi&#39;an&#39;s central city, about 20 minutes&#39; drive from the city center, and close to the East Third Ring Road . Property staff said that at the end of 2022, with the opening of the subway Mujiangwang Station next to the community, the rent in the community will also increase slightly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This real estate project with good market conditions is the origin of a series of lawsuits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng was born in Taibai Village, Shuigou Township, Shangnan County, Shangluo City, Shaanxi Province in 1980. After dropping out of junior high school, he went out to work. He claimed that he received advice from businessmen while working in other provinces, and returned to Xi&#39;an to do computer wholesale business and made his first pot of gold. Later, he was introduced to Xi&#39;an and started contracting projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2005, Hu Xufeng established Shaanxi Hongrun Industrial Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Hongrun Group&quot;) in Xi&#39;an. In May 2006, Shaanxi Hongrun Real Estate Development Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Hongrun Real Estate&quot;) was registered and established. Hu Xufeng, who is only 26 years old, has the ability to buy a first-floor office building as the company&#39;s office space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2005, the Xi&#39;an Municipal People&#39;s Government issued the &quot;Opinions on Accelerating the Transformation of Urban Villages&quot; (Municipal Administration [2005] No. 92), proposing to &quot;encourage social capital investment to participate in urban village transformation projects to make up for the government&#39;s Fund shortage situation.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this wave of urban village (shanty town) renovation, Hu Xufeng was introduced by someone and signed a joint development contract with the Mujiangwang Village Committee of Baqiao District in March 2007. After that, Hu Xufeng injected capital to start the project. While demolishing and demolishing, he built relocation housing and built commercial housing for sale to the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Hu Xufeng’s statistics, from the start of the project to the borrowing from Wang Jian in 2012, it invested a total of 820 million yuan in the Mujiangwang Village reconstruction project, with the funds coming from self-raised and private loans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to media reports of the year, the renovation of Mujiangwang Village was the largest project among the first batch of urban village renovations in Xi&#39;an. As for why it borrowed money from the private sector, &quot;the main reason was that the city&#39;s urban reform at that time was characterized by incomplete materials and insufficient procedures.&quot; Hu Xufeng&#39;s explanation was that the project land was developed first without the government purchasing and storing it, and the developer did not obtain the land use rights. Unable to get a bank mortgage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng named the commercial housing he built International Happy City, and the first batch of about 100 units were sold out within three days. During the development process, in 2010, Hu Xufeng’s friend Zhu Yaojiang proposed to take a stake. Judgment No. 1377 of Zhejiang 0603 Xingchu shows that Zhu Yaojiang was born in Shengzhou City, Zhejiang Province in 1966. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng said that in his early business activities, Zhu Yaojiang provided help. When buying shares, Zhu Yaojiang introduced him to the actual investor Li Bin and introduced Li Bin’s identity as a social worker in Shaanxi Province. President of the Charity Foundation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 14, 2010, Zhu Yaojiang lent 80 million yuan to Hongrun Real Estate in the name of Xi&#39;an Zhongsha Investment Co., Ltd., and Hu Xufeng transferred 18% of Hongrun Real Estate&#39;s shares to Zhongsha Company for free, agreeing that The shares will be returned free of charge after Zhongxia Company obtains 18% of the project income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng said that when he borrowed money from outside the country before, no creditors asked him to mortgage his equity. &quot;Most of them were mortgages for houses that we have not yet opened.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On January 11, 2012, Zhu Yaojiang introduced Wang Jian to lend 6 million yuan to Hongrun Real Estate. The loan materials obtained by Southern Weekend reporters show that Wang Jian was born in 1968 in Taizhou, Zhejiang. The term of this loan is 3 months. Hu Xufeng will transfer 75% of the shares of Hongrun Real Estate to Wang Jian for free. After Hu Xufeng repays the loan, Wang Jian will transfer it back to Hu Xufeng for free. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the market value of the Mujiangwang Village renovation project at that time, the proportion of pledged equity corresponding to the two loans of Zhu Yaojiang and Wang Jian did not conform to normal business logic. In the subsequent lengthy litigation, Hu Xufeng compared it to a &quot;snake swallowing an elephant&quot;, but did not provide a precise explanation for the abnormal equity pledge ratio. According to Hu Xufeng, he repeatedly asked for repayment of debts, but both creditors proposed to change the cooperation method, and the debt repayment was abandoned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/lm6tN82Qv6ijldU6z94DFvOHB4Ewn60YEuvNgeSH.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1038&quot; height= &quot;778&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/lm6tN82Qv6ijldU6z94DFvOHB4Ewn60YEuvNgeSH.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252273&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 19, 2023, 16 years after the project was launched, many unfinished buildings can be seen at the site of Mujiangwang Village. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Zhai Xingli/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Forged signature&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In this regard, Hongrun Real Estate, which was originally 100% controlled by Hu Xufeng and his wife, is left with only Hu Xufeng&#39;s wife Chen and Hongrun Group holding a total of 7% of the shares. In March 2013, the legal representative of Hongrun Real Estate was changed from Hu Xufeng to Zhuyaojiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Hu Xufeng claimed that he only learned about the fact that only 7% of the equity was left in July 2014, more than two years after the loan agreement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his account, in the previous two years, he had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer, operated, and recovered. During the treatment, the capital chain of Hongrun Real Estate was broken. Although Zhu Yaojiang and Wang Jian jointly obtained Hongrun Real Estate 93% of the equity, but no further capital injection into the project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng tried to restart the project. He went to the industrial and commercial department to inquire and found that on January 10, 2012, the industrial and commercial department received the application materials for registration of changes in equity interests of Hongrun Real Estate shareholders and approved the application on the 31st of that month. Registered the change of 75% of the equity of Hongrun Real Estate to Wang Jian&#39;s name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the application materials, there is a &quot;Shareholders Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; signed on January 10, 2012, which is the document recognized by the Supreme Court. The content is that the Hongrun Real Estate Shareholders Meeting has studied and approved the transfer of 75% of the equity. Transferred to Wang Jian. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The date of the loan agreement between Wang Jian and Hongrun Real Estate is January 11, 2012. Hu Xufeng applied for an appraisal from the Judicial Appraisal Center of Northwest University of Political Science and Law. The appraisal opinion shows that the signatures of Hu Xufeng and Wang Jian on this shareholder transfer capital contribution agreement are not their own signatures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters contacted Wang Jian after many attempts. Wang Jian responded via text message to a reporter from Southern Weekend: &quot;The whole lies and stories fabricated by Hu Xufeng have troubled me for more than ten years and caused a lot of pressure and shadow to me and my family. At present, there are irresistible problems in all aspects.&quot; Overturning the conclusion, I don’t want to be entangled with such social liars, ruffians, and scoundrels anymore, and I don’t want to explain anything in this matter. The government department will definitely come up with a conclusion about who committed the crime in violation of the law, but before the time comes, the company will go bankrupt. Everything will be revealed during liquidation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, Wang Jian refused to explain the facts about his loan situation with Hu Xufeng, equity disputes and handwriting identification. He asked: &quot;He was really rich and capable back then. Do you want to engage in such a big project?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2014, Hu Xufeng and his wife took Hongrun Real Estate to court, claiming that the signatures on the &quot;Shareholders Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; were forged and completed without the knowledge of Hu&#39;s wife Chen. On the grounds that the transfer of 75% of the shares violated Chen’s right of first refusal, the court requested the court to invalidate the “Shareholder Transfer and Capital Contribution Agreement” and restore the industrial and commercial registration information of Hongrun Real Estate to the state before the change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 29, 2015, the Xi&#39;an Intermediate People&#39;s Court made a verdict. The court found that the signatures of Hu Xufeng and Wang Jian on the &quot;Shareholder Transfer and Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; signed on January 10, 2012 were not signed by the two of them, and Wang Jian himself had no objection to this. The court ruled that the agreement was invalid, but rejected the Hu Xufeng couple&#39;s other claims. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jian refused to accept the decision and appealed to the Shaanxi Provincial High Court. Wang Jian argued to the court that although the signatures of Hu Xufeng and Wang Jian on the &quot;Shareholders Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; signed on January 10, 2012 were not signed by the two of them, there was another agreement signed by Hongrun Real Estate on January 10. The &quot;Shareholders Meeting Resolution&quot; transferring 75% of the shares to Wang Jian has the signature of Hu Xufeng&#39;s wife Chen. Chen cannot prove that her signature is forged, so Chen knows and agrees to the agreement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters repeatedly asked Hu Xufeng and his wife for verification. They insisted that the signature was not signed by Chen, but &quot;because the appraisal fee was very expensive and they were short of money at the time, they only authenticated the &quot;Shareholder Transfer and Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; &quot;The signature on the &quot;Shareholders&#39; Meeting Resolution&quot; was not authenticated.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 25, 2015, the Shaanxi Provincial High Court made a judgment. The court found that after signing the &quot;Shareholders Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; on January 10, 2012, Hu Xufeng and his wife confirmed the authenticity of the agreement several times at the Hongrun Real Estate shareholders&#39; meeting and external agreements on March 15, 2013. The validity of the agreement was not raised and no objection was raised. Therefore, its appeal to determine that the agreement was invalid &quot;has no factual and legal basis and this court will not support it in accordance with the law.&quot; The second-instance judgment of the Shaanxi Provincial High Court revoked the first-instance judgment of the Xi&#39;an Intermediate People&#39;s Court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng refused to accept the lawsuit, and the lawsuit eventually went to the Supreme People&#39;s Court. On May 29, 2019, the Supreme People&#39;s Court issued (2017) Supreme Court Judgment No. 171, upholding the judgment of the Shaanxi Provincial High Court. However, the Supreme People&#39;s Court found that the &quot;Shareholder Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; signed on January 10, 2012 was a pledge guarantee by changing the equity holder, and it did not have the effect of equity transfer because it was not the true expression of intention of the parties. As for both parties, &quot;whether the equity pledge in the loan relationship complies with legal regulations can be resolved through separate legal channels.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Administrative Protest&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The reason why the Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau became the defendant is also because of the above two signatures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng requested the court to order the bureau to cancel the change registration and re-register the shares under the name of Hongrun Group on the grounds that the bureau relied on the &quot;Shareholder Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; with forged signatures in the change registration. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The case was assigned to the Xi&#39;an Xincheng District People&#39;s Court for trial. On July 8, 2016, Xincheng Court issued an administrative judgment. The court found that when the bureau reviewed the change registration application materials submitted by a third party, it did not find that the signatures on the shareholder capital contribution agreement were not made by the company&#39;s legal representative and shareholders. &quot;It was a flaw in the industrial and commercial change registration and did not affect the administration.&quot; the legality of the conduct”. Hu Xufeng lost the lawsuit. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Xi&#39;an Intermediate Court, which upheld the original verdict. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 18, 2019, Hu Xufeng filed a protest with the Xi’an Municipal People’s Procuratorate, and the Shaanxi Provincial People’s Procuratorate supported the protest. The Shaanxi Provincial High Court ordered the Xi&#39;an Intermediate People&#39;s Court to conduct a retrial. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2020, the prosecutor of the Seventh Procuratorate Department of the Shaanxi Provincial People’s Procuratorate appeared in court to protest. According to the official website of the court, this is the first time that the Shaanxi Provincial People’s Procuratorate has sent personnel to attend the retrial court for administrative protest cases after the internal institutional reform of the Shaanxi Provincial Procuratorate and the establishment of a separate administrative prosecution department. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau argued that the law requires administrative agencies to conduct a formal review for the registration of changes in shareholder equity. The change application materials at that time were complete and met the formal requirements stipulated by the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Administrative Licensing Law, formal review is a concept corresponding to substantive review. Formal review refers to the review that the application materials submitted by the applicant are complete and in compliance with the legal form, while substantive review refers to the administrative agency’s review of the applicant. The authenticity and legality of the content of the materials provided. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bureau argued that &quot;Although the &quot;Shareholder Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; was not signed by me, the content of the agreement represents the true intention of the parties, and there is evidence to prove that the facts of the agreement are recognized by both parties.&quot; In addition, although The Supreme People&#39;s Court determined that the &quot;Shareholders Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; is in the nature of an equity guarantee and does not have the effect of equity transfer, &quot;but it does not affect the outcome of the administrative case. Our bureau has fulfilled its reasonable review obligations and has no responsibility to revoke this administrative action.&quot; and obligations”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bureau emphasized to the court that administrative actions have conclusive power, and the registration of equity changes reflects the true meaning of Hongrun Real Estate’s equity transfer guarantee in appearance, and cannot antagonize bona fide counterparts. Likewise, it does not affect administrative matters. Effectiveness of behavior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng&#39;s litigation attorney objected, &quot;Equity transfer guarantee and equity pledge are two completely different legal relationships.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Civil Code, equity transfer guarantee means that the debtor transfers the equity to the name of the creditor. After the debtor pays off the debt when due, the creditor should return the equity to the debtor. Equity pledge can only obtain equity ownership after the debt matures through auction, (liquidation) or negotiation procedures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the finding in the Supreme Court&#39;s judgment that a pledge guarantee is made by changing the equity holder, it does not have the effect of equity transfer because it is not the true intention of the parties. The parties in the dispute case have argued that Each has its own understanding and expression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 18, 2020, the Xi&#39;an Intermediate People&#39;s Court issued a retrial verdict, and Hu Xufeng lost the case again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the application of law to the aforementioned two focus issues in this dispute, the Small and Medium Enterprises Business Environment Research Group of the Law School of Xi&#39;an University of Finance and Economics commissioned the Civil Law Research Society of the China Law Society on August 31, 2023. Four legal experts, namely Yang Lixin, vice president, Cui Jianyuan, vice president of the Civil Law Research Society of the China Law Society, Wang Xizhen, executive director of the Administrative Law Research Society of the China Law Society, and Wang Bo, dean of the Law School of Xi&#39;an University of Finance and Economics, organized the seminar and issued a legal Opinions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The legal opinions put forward by the experts at the meeting include: Hu Xufeng’s signature in the “Equity (East) Transfer and Capital Contribution Agreement” dated January 10, 2012 is forged. This document is a false material, and any agreement based on this false material should be revoked. Administrative decision on the registration of change of equity transfer of Hongrun Real Estate; the agreement reached between Wang Jian and Hongrun Group is an equity transfer guarantee, not an equity pledge. If the aforementioned change registration is regarded as a valid equity transfer guarantee registration, Wang Jian will act as a creditor , has no right to exercise shareholder rights and can only receive priority repayment for the equity involved in the case; Hongrun Group, as the debtor and guarantor, has the right to request Wang Jian to return the equity and change the equity registration after repaying the loan. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The final chapter is coming&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the dispute that lasted for more than ten years, the Mujiangwang Village reconstruction project experienced unfinished work, changed hands, and the villagers many times During the petition, Southern Weekend reporters saw at the scene that there are still 10 buildings in unfinished condition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned from the villagers of Mujiangwang Village that around 2015, the government-funded relocation houses were delivered, and the last batch of villagers moved back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2015, the Xi&#39;an Bahe New District Management Committee changed the project subject from Hongrun Real Estate to Shaanxi Jiaxinyuan Industrial Co., Ltd. The government department advanced 140 million yuan to build some relocation houses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The control of Hongrun Real Estate is still being contested by all parties. Zhu Yaojiang was sentenced by the Keqiao Court in 2017. According to the law, he can no longer serve as the legal representative of Hongrun Real Estate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 13, 2017, the People&#39;s Court of Keqiao District, Shaoxing City, Zhejiang Province issued the (2016) Zhejiang 0603 Xingchu No. 1377 Judgment. Zhu Yaojiang was sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment for the crime of embezzlement and illegal absorption of public deposits. 13 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are Hu Xufeng’s witness statements on pages 22 and 33 of this judgment. However, Hu Xufeng insisted that he was traveling between Xi&#39;an, Beijing and other places at the time and had not received any inquiries or evidence collection from Shaanxi or Zhejiang public prosecutors and law enforcement departments regarding the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At noon on September 20, 2023, the Keqiao District People&#39;s Court responded to Southern Weekend reporters that after verification, during the handling of the case, the Economic Investigation Brigade of the High-tech Branch of the Xi&#39;an Public Security Bureau transferred 46 files along with it. A set of case materials, including Hu Xufeng&#39;s witness testimony. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng’s sister said that on September 23, 2023, she contacted the police officer handling the case at the time, and the other party said that a report record had been made when Hu Xufeng reported the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report refers to the fact that in August 2014, Zhu Yaojiang’s sister was arrested by the Xi’an police on suspicion of illegally absorbing public deposits. Hu Xufeng reported to the Xi’an Public Security Bureau at that time that Zhu Yaojiang was the mastermind behind the case. Hu Xufeng produced the original reporting materials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Are crime report transcripts equivalent to witness statements submitted to the court? The policemen handling the case and Hu Xufeng each held their own opinions. However, (2016) Zhejiang 0603 Xingchu No. 1377 Judgment shows that Zhu Yaojiang was only criminally detained in November 2015. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2017, Hui Xiping, then director of the Hongqi Subdistrict Office in Baqiao District, Xi&#39;an City, said in an interview with CCTV&#39;s &quot;News Investigation&quot; program that Zhu Yaojiang and Wang Jian collectively acquired 93% of the shares of Hongrun Real Estate. Later, it was discovered that the actual controller of Hongrun Real Estate was not these two people, but the aforementioned actual investor Li Bin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are different opinions about Li Bin’s life. Some media once quoted the article &quot;&quot;Luxury Monk&quot; Li Bin&quot; published in the 14th issue of &quot;China Entrepreneur&quot; magazine in 2007 to introduce his life. Southern Weekend reporters were unable to find the original text of the report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned in Li Bin’s parents’ neighborhood that his father was a team worker at Xi’an Film Studio. He returned to his hometown in Mei County, Baoji City a few years ago. Li Bin also worked in Xi’an Film Production The factory worked briefly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As far as the relationship between Hu Xufeng and Li Bin is concerned, since losing control of Hongrun Real Estate, Hu Xufeng said that he can no longer contact Li Bin. After Hu Xufeng started litigation to defend his rights, Li Bin reported Hu Xufeng to the public security agency on the grounds of gang involvement. Hu Xufeng also publicly reported Li Bin with his real name for the same reason. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 25, 2019, the Shaanxi Provincial Public Security Department handed over to Xi&#39;an the clues that Hu Xufeng reported about Li Bin and others&#39; suspected crimes in the form of a Director&#39;s Supervision Order (Supervision of Crime Leads No. 044) Verification by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Xi’an Municipal Public Security Bureau confirmed to Southern Weekend reporters that regarding the two people’s reports of each other, the public security organs did not find any illegal or criminal facts on both sides after a lot of work. Whistleblower”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a series of processes such as notarized delivery, convening of extraordinary shareholders&#39; meetings, and announcements, Hongrun Real Estate submitted materials for changing the legal representative to the Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau in April 2022. The bureau issued a &quot;Notice of Refusal to Registration&quot; on August 22 of that year, rejecting the application for change of registration on the grounds that the identity of the convener of the shareholders&#39; meeting did not comply with the provisions of the Company Law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the processing results alone, Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau did not support Hu Xufeng&#39;s application for change of registration, nor did it support the applications of Li Bin and Wang Jian. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hongrun Real Estate then sued the bureau to the Xi&#39;an Railway Transport Court. On December 30, 2022, the court issued a first-instance judgment in which Hongrun Real Estate won the case. The court ordered the Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau to re-administer Hongrun Real Estate&#39;s change application within 60 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau was dissatisfied and appealed to the Xi&#39;an Railway Transport Intermediate Court.

The week before, the United States and Iran publicly reached a &quot;prisoner exchange agreement.&quot; The content of the agreement includes the United States unfreezing $6 billion of Iranian oil funds in South Korea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This move caused waves in the political arena. The Biden administration has been strongly criticized by US Republicans, saying that unfreezing US$6 billion is equivalent to paying a &quot;ransom&quot; and is an &quot;appeasement policy.&quot; What puzzles the outside world is why the two countries, as &quot;old enemies&quot;, &quot;swap prisoners&quot; during this time period? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many interviewed experts told Southern Weekend reporters that the United States and Iran have their own calculations behind this move, but it remains to be seen whether it can be realized. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Prisoner Exchange&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Who are the arrested Americans? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before his arrest, 51-year-old businessman Siamak Namazi worked as the director of strategic planning at Dubai-based Crescent Petroleum Company. He was arrested by Iran&#39;s Revolutionary Guards in October 2015, while his 86-year-old father Bakr was arrested in February 2016 after Iranian officials allowed him to visit his son in prison. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The British Broadcasting Corporation reported that they were eventually sentenced to ten years in prison by Iran for &quot;cooperating with foreign hostile countries&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In recent years, the United States has repeatedly proposed to rescue or extradite Namazi. Because these people obviously serve the United States or have made great contributions to the United States, the United States is unwilling Give them up,&quot; said Li Shaoxian, director of the China Arab Studies Institute at Ningxia University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another 59-year-old Iranian-American businessman Emad Shaji moved to Iran from the United States with his wife in 2017. In November 2020, Iran&#39;s Revolutionary Court summoned him and informed him that he would be convicted of &quot;espionage&quot; and sentenced to 10 years in prison. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April of the following year, his daughters told the Washington Post that their father, Shaji, was in &quot;a deplorable situation&quot; in prison and that prison guards only allowed him to make a few brief, monitored phone calls. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tabaz, a 67-year-old businessman, was arrested together with eight other Iranian environmentalists in 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The BBC reported that Tabaz’s organization, a member of the Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation, has been using cameras to track critically endangered wild Asian cheetahs and was accused of using its environmental projects as a “gathering of confidential information” cover&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tabaz and his colleagues deny Iran&#39;s accusations against them. But in the end Tabaz was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2019. He is being held in Evin prison in Iran. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2023, these arrested American businessmen were released due to the &quot;prisoner exchange agreement&quot; between the United States and Iran. The names and circumstances of the other two Americans released have not yet been released. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a statement after his release, Namazi expressed his gratitude and was very interested in knowing the progress of updating mobile phone equipment. &quot;When I was arrested, the iPhone 6S had just come out.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other side of the prisoner exchange, Iranian media confirmed on the afternoon of September 18, 2023 that five Iranian citizens imprisoned in the United States had also been released. . Of the five Iranians released, only two chose to return to Iran. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, Cavlani and Kashani were accused of violating &quot;sanctions.&quot; Afrasiabi, a political scientist living in Boston, was arrested at his home in 2021 on charges of being an &quot;agent of the Iranian government.&quot; Ansari and Hassanzadeh were accused of &quot;links to Iranian security forces.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Shaoxian said that the prisoner exchange matter contemplated by the United States and Iran is not a temporary decision. In fact, in the US-Iran relationship, the two sides have been fighting for each other to release their own people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The United States and Iran have always been &quot;old enemies&quot; and have no diplomatic relations. Qatar served as the mediator for this &quot;prisoner exchange&quot;. According to public reports, negotiations between the two parties were also conducted in Doha, the capital of Qatar. After at least eight rounds of back-and-forth between Qatar and Qatar, the United States and Iran&#39;s &quot;air-space negotiations&quot; finally reached a prisoner exchange agreement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2022, after Iran proposed its latest nuclear agreement plan, the United States believed that Iran had regressed and decided to withdraw from the negotiations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Iran&#39;s reason is that since the United States has withdrawn from the nuclear agreement, Iran is the official representative, so it does not need to face the United States. Face-to-face talks will not occur until the United States resumes the nuclear agreement.&quot; Li Shao said that at that time The EU agrees and agrees with the United States and condemns Iran, so it cannot continue to be the middleman now. &quot;Qatar therefore plays a very important role in this negotiation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Thaw&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The agreement, brokered by the Qatari government, represents It marked an unusual moment of cooperation between the United States and Iran and a rare agreement between two long-time enemies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This deal is an important stepping stone.” Sanan Wakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House in the UK, said that the months-long negotiations have restarted the US-Iran relationship. Indirect bilateral dialogue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bloomberg reported on September 19, 2023 that according to the prisoner exchange agreement, while the United States and Iran exchanged detainees, Iran’s previously frozen oil export payments of US$6 billion in South Korea were remitted to Qatar through Switzerland. Domestic Iranian bank account. The prisoners were released hours after the funds were unfrozen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;South Korea is a &quot;large consumer&quot; of Iranian oil, and the $6 billion that was unfrozen was previously South Korea&#39;s payment for Iranian oil. In 2010, the Central Bank of Iran opened Korean Won accounts in two South Korean banks specifically to collect payments from South Korea. At that time, Iran could withdraw the funds in the accounts at will. In September 2019, the Central Bank of Iran was included in the sanctions list by the United States, and US$6 billion in payments were frozen in the account. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Iran is rich in oil and natural gas resources. For Iran, US$6 billion is a small amount of money under normal circumstances.&quot; Li Shaoxian analyzed, but for Iran in the past few years, &quot;it is definitely a timely help.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reuters reported that after Qatar and Switzerland confirmed that the funds were in the account, Qatar sent a plane to take five U.S. citizens and two of their relatives out of Iran. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yin Gang, an expert on Middle East issues at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that Iran is not only economically difficult, but also diplomatically. At present, Iran can accept such conditions, which shows that Iran urgently needs to ease its international status and change its international balance of payments situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, both the United States and Iran have &quot;different ideas&quot; regarding the implementation of the negotiation results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that when the two sides reached a prisoner exchange agreement, Iran also specifically added the validity period of the agreement. That is, if the frozen payment is not received within two months, the prisoner exchange agreement will automatically be invalidated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The two sides have no trust at all, so they just set a deadline.&quot; Li Shaoxian said that this matter is relatively sensitive for both parties, and the United States and Iran have many different voices in the country. &quot;I think the two-month limit is considered from a realistic perspective, and it also reflects that both parties want to accomplish this.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that US Republicans are criticizing the Biden administration&#39;s prisoner exchange. At the time of the move, it was stated that the unfreezing of 6 billion US dollars was equivalent to paying a ransom and may lead to more &quot;hostages&quot; being held. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Although this group of U.S. citizens have been released, there is no guarantee that other Americans who decide to go to Iran despite long-term warnings from the U.S. government will get similar results.&quot; On September 18, the U.S. Secretary of State announced Lincoln warned the people at home. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Win or Lose&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The outside world has received mixed reviews about this prisoner exchange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Al Jazeera reported that Sina Tusi, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, a Washington think tank, said that the prisoner exchange was an &quot;important first step.&quot; She said, &quot;This creates a basis for the United States and Iran to get rid of hostile and confrontational policies, and is expected to reach a broader diplomatic agreement.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The United States will hold a presidential election in November 2024, and at this stage, the two sides have restarted negotiations Friendly relations are unrealistic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tusi said Biden was unlikely to make concessions to Iran before the vote, which would draw attacks from Republican hawks. Iran, on the other hand, hopes to maintain its influence &quot;in case Trump returns to power.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported on September 19 that the prisoner exchange agreement was a signal of partial easing of US-Iran relations. It marked a breakthrough in relations between the United States and Iran, long-time enemies, although the two countries remain at odds on a range of issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Objective analysis shows that the United States has made a compromise.&quot; Li Shaoxian pointed out that in addition to US$6 billion, the Biden administration actually &quot;turned a blind eye&quot; to Iran&#39;s oil exports. Therefore, Iran&#39;s oil exports have increased significantly in recent months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;On the one hand, this move can be seen as a sign of the easing of bilateral relations between the United States and Iran. On the other hand, the United States also wants to reduce the diplomatic pressure on South Korea.&quot; Yin Gang analyzed the current relationship between the United States and South Korea Also very important. If South Korea does not pay oil to Iran, it will have great dissatisfaction with South Korea and will bring great difficulties to South Korea&#39;s diplomacy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But American Republicans have different opinions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 18, former US President Trump publicly stated, &quot;The United States, which was highly respected three years ago, has now become the laughing stock of the world.&quot; Former Vice President Pence criticized Biden, Allowing Iran to “foment terrorism across the Middle East.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Shaoxian analyzed that the struggle between the two parties in the United States is now booming, and the two parties are even more sharply opposed on the Iran issue and the Iranian nuclear issue. Although Biden did not lift sanctions on Iran after taking office, his goal is to restore the nuclear agreement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Surprisingly, on the day of the prisoner exchange, Biden issued a statement saying that the United States would impose sanctions on former Iranian President Ahmadinejad and the Iranian Intelligence Ministry on the grounds that relevant individuals and Institutions are complicit in “wrongfully imprisoning” American citizens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Wall Street Journal commented on September 19 that the Biden administration has been trying to ease tensions with Iran, but it is clear that exchanging prisoners while imposing new sanctions on Iran will complicate the problem again. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the continued sanctions imposed by the United States, it seems to have become the norm for countries around the world to face restrictive measures in certain areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Iranian President Raisi said that the United States has no right to decide how Iran will use the $6 billion in funds that are about to be unfrozen. He emphasized that the frozen funds originally belonged to the Iranian people and the Iranian government, and the use was not determined by the U.S. government. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Shaoxian analyzed that Iran’s nuclear technology capabilities have improved very quickly. &quot;The United States is very anxious, and Europe is also anxious.&quot; He said that under such circumstances, although the United States publicly did not lift sanctions, it gradually released its policies to whet Iran&#39;s appetite. Iran also deliberately slowed down the production of highly enriched uranium. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There have been rumors in the international community that behind the deal, Iran promised to have active dialogue with the United States in the next step on the nuclear issue.&quot; Yin Gang said that at present, the entire Middle East The situation is on the trend of easing, between Iran and Arab countries, and between Iran and the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When will there be a breakthrough in the long-stalled Iranian nuclear negotiations? Will the tension between the United States and Iran gradually ease? These issues will also affect the trend of the global political landscape. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend intern Xu Ziyi also contributed to this article)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt; hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[失落的1945——张爱玲“笔误”解谜丨云端]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257677]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/26/MOoJJcgGQN3BIjhiUWiurpcBJO2W25OAjeX0Mvgd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;726&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/MOoJJcgGQN3BIjhiUWiurpcBJO2W25OAjeX0 Mvgd. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252201&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Manuscript of Zhang Ailing&#39;s novel &quot;Little Reunion&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;I forgot again&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Zhang Ailing There are many examples of poor memory. Reading the 700,000-word &quot;Collected Letters of Zhang Ailing&quot; edited by Song Yilang and recently published by Crown has deepened this feeling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, Zhang Ailing’s bad memory focused on dates and numbers. The more famous &quot;public case&quot; is about the &quot;Genius Dream&quot; which gave birth to Zhang&#39;s famous saying &quot;Life is a gorgeous robe, covered with lice&quot;. Until her later years, Zhang Ailing was still bitter about the &quot;unfair treatment&quot; she suffered in the &quot;West Wind&quot; essay competition when she was 19 years old. However, scholars and Zhang fans have verified that she remembered everything wrong, whether it was the limit on the number of words in the essay, the format of the essay, or even the awards. , and maybe I didn’t read the specific terms of the essay advertisement clearly back then. The number of words in the competition was limited to 5,000, but she mistakenly thought it was 500; when she finally won the third honorary award, she wrote it as a &quot;special award&quot;; she even recorded the more than 1,500 words of her award-winning article as more than 490 words. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was looking through old magazines at home not long ago and accidentally found the July 2004 issue of &quot;Yin Ke&quot;. In this issue of Zhang Ailing&#39;s album, there was published a letter she wrote to the Chinese Embassy in Washington on June 4, 1966. Letter from the British Embassy. At the time, Eileen Chang was interested in applying for a position as a writer-in-residence at a university and required proof of academic qualifications. Due to the loss of her documents, she wrote to the University of Hong Kong to request a replacement. However, the Registrar of the University of Hong Kong only certified that she had &quot;two ins and two outs&quot; and did not mention that she had received a certificate for her excellent academic performance. Scholarships and other honors, several negotiations failed. At that time, Hong Kong was still under British rule, so she wrote to the British Embassy in Washington for help. To explain his situation, there is this paragraph in the letter of more than a thousand words: &quot;...I immigrated to the United States in 1955, married an American in the 1960s, and obtained American citizenship. My mother has been naturalized as a British citizen, and she was a British citizen in 1958. Passed away in London...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I had never read this letter before, and I was very interested. But I was really surprised when I read this: She and Laiya registered their marriage in August 1956, the second year after arriving in the United States. On August 14th and August 18th, she also wrote to Kuang Wenmei, why did it suddenly become the &quot;60s&quot;? Her mother Huang Yifan died of illness in London on October 11, 1957. On October 24, she accurately reported in a letter to Song Qi and his wife that her mother had &quot;died two weeks ago&quot;, but the letter to the embassy read &quot;1958&quot; in black and white. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/J7ek9M46hhsAvN7cc670HxW3bYAzesTK5Rxozede.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1267&quot; height= &quot;1593&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/J7ek9M46hhsAvN7cc670HxW3bYAzesTK5Rxozede.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252200&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The photo that her mother took with her when she left China returned to Zhang Ailing after her death. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This letter was translated into Chinese by Chen Ziyu, and Su Weizhen wrote the introduction. Neither of them discovered it, so it was also There is no &quot;clerical error&quot; noted in the letter. Indeed, no one would have thought that in 1966, Zhang Ailing was 46 years old and was only middle-aged. No matter how bad her memory was, she would not have mistaken the year of her mother&#39;s death and the year of her remarriage. Moreover, she wrote a formal letter to an official agency. inside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, when I saw so many &quot;I remembered wrongly&quot; and &quot;I forgot again&quot; in the collection of letters between Zhang Ailing and Song Qi, I was no longer surprised. Zhang Ailing lives largely on royalties in the United States, but she can&#39;t even figure out whether Crown Publishing&#39;s fixed royalties for a certain period of time are US$2,000 for half a year or a year. What&#39;s even more outrageous is that before leaving Hong Kong for the United States in 1955, with the help of Song Qi, she advanced all the royalties for two scripts from the Telecom Company, but she forgot all about it five years later. Only after being reminded by Kwong Wenmei did she remember that she had done so. This is the case. It is simply unbelievable that a person who is most afraid of owing money or favors would forget such a sum of money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few days, I have been browsing a collection of essays by book reviewer Liu Zheng, and I came across an article titled &quot;Zhang Ailing Remembers Wrongly&quot;, which records the errors in words, sources, plots, and mistakes in Zhang Ailing&#39;s works. , a total of 22 cases, which is eye-opening. Regarding citation errors, I also read in Chen Zishan&#39;s &quot;Cong Kao of Zhang Ailing&quot; that Zhang Ailing quoted Lu Xun&#39;s translation of the Soviet writer Shuxue Jianke (also translated as Zuoqenko) in 1926 in &quot;Talk about Eating and Painting Cake to Appease Hungry&quot;. The short story &quot;Women of a Noble Family&quot; in 2000 was mistakenly written as &quot;Baozi&quot;; while &quot;Baozi&quot; written by Zhang Ailing was actually translated by Lu Xun as &quot;Meat Buns&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both Chen Zishan and Liu Zheng are sharp-eyed and knowledgeable, but they still respect Zhang Ailing. Liu Zheng said: &quot;In terms of human relations and physics, as well as in choosing words and sentences, Zhang Ailing can be said to be a very thoughtful person. However, she did not seem to care much about whether the quotations were accurate. In addition, it was very difficult to check the information at that time, so Zhang Ailing She doesn’t have the habit of collecting books, so it’s normal to have some misremembering when quoting. To put it into perspective, Zhang Ailing obviously doesn’t have a ‘photographic memory’, maybe she just has a poor memory; what she left behind There are really not too many clerical errors.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Zheng explained that he had no other intention in writing down these when he was studying, but just for fun - Zhang Ailing would also remember it wrong! At the end of the article, a sentence from Sontag&#39;s novel &quot;The Volcano Lover&quot; was quoted: &quot;Genius, like beauty, everything, well almost everything, will be forgiven.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Interestingly, He attributed the clerical errors to memory and unverified information. On the contrary, Zhang Ailing said in &quot;Contrast Notes&quot;: Freud, the master of psychological analysis, believed that there is no clerical error or an occasional wrong word, it is all what he thought in his heart and revealed it inadvertently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But it was also in &quot;Contrast Notes&quot; that Zhang Ailing left another famous &quot;clerical error&quot;: the well-documented &quot;cool party&quot; in Shanghai on July 21, 1945 The photo taken with Li Xianglan was annotated as &quot;Meet the movie star Li Xianglan at a garden party in 1943.&quot; As if following the Freudian line of thinking mentioned by Eileen Chang, two scholars have tried to analyze whether Chang Eileen&#39;s &quot;clerical error&quot; of &quot;one or two years&quot; was just due to poor memory, or there is another meaningful reason behind it. . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;1945&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Cooling Party/1943 Garden Party&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Comparative Notes - Looking at Old Photo Albums&quot; is Zhang Ailing&#39;s last work This work is also her only autobiographical collection of pictures and texts. &quot;Picture 41&quot; in the book is a photo of her and Li Xianglan that has been treasured for nearly 50 years. She wrote: In 1943, she met Li Xianglan at a garden party and wanted to take a photo together. She was too tall and the two of them would complement each other if they stood side by side. , someone asked her to sit down, and Li Xianglan stood aside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/iEioqzjAsX9CGyu33WRvaDrFnNz5X5Lb1h9JvdFX.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;693&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/iEioqzjAsX9CGyu33WRvaDrFnNz5X5Lb1h9JvdFX.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252202&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1943, Zhang Ailing and Li Xianglan (right) took a photo in Shanghai. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The book &quot;After Yun&quot; mentions clothes made from the quilt cover of my grandmother&#39;s bed.

I have never seen a similar pattern elsewhere.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;1943&quot;, this year is ridiculously wrong, the correct time and place is: July 1945 On the 21st, a &quot;cool party&quot; hosted by &quot;Magazine&quot; was held at No. 2 Xianyang Road, Shanghai. The basis is &quot;Magazine&quot; in August 1945, which published the article &quot;Records of Enjoying the Cool Coolness&quot;. In addition to this picture of Zhang Ailing and Li Xianglan, there is another group photo: Li Xianglan and Zhang Ailing maintain the same posture, and Zhang Ailing&#39;s aunt is also seen. Zhang Maoyuan, his best friend Yan Ying, an unidentified Ms. Chen, and two men in long gowns - Chen Binhe, the president of the Shenbao Press during the Wang puppet period, and Jin Xiongbai, the president of the Pingbao Press. According to Shao Yingjian, a Chinese scholar who studied in Japan and is now a researcher in Japan, in the book &quot;The Legendary Literature and Rumor Life of Zhang Ailing&quot;, Xianyang Road was the name of the current Shaanxi South Road from 1943 to 1945. It was older. The name familiar to Shanghainese is &quot;Yalpe Road&quot;. No. 2 Xianyang Road was the garden of Jin Xiongbai’s private residence at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1994, when &quot;Contrast&quot; was published, it was the year before Zhang Ailing&#39;s death. In her declining years, she had to study the skirt that she had changed from her grandmother&#39;s old quilt cover, from the texture, color, pattern, Patterns, origins, styles, designs, and tailors are all fresh and clear in my memory. Why do I remember the wrong time and place when I took the photo? What kind of information does this 1943, this &quot;clerical error&quot; reveal? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shao Yingjian believes that if you understand Zhang Ailing’s life, this mystery will not be difficult to solve. For Zhang Ailing, 1943 to 1945 were the most glorious days in this life. She wrote &quot;Legend&quot; and &quot;Rumors&quot; in just two years, and she rose to the top of the literary world when she was just starting out. &quot;In the database of the brain, this is a A perfect file, with no details, displayed in its entirety on the screen of memory.&quot; - This statement is very tempting: in the stage of life when the fire is burning, the oil is blooming, and the flowers are blooming, the memory is mixed and unclear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for what Shao Yingjian pointed out, Zhang Ailing wrote &quot;cooling party&quot; as &quot;garden party&quot;, in my opinion, it does not seem to be a clerical error, just like some people say that going to a &quot;theater&quot; or &quot;cinema&quot; to watch a movie is not a mistake. substantial difference. But researcher Shao focused on the difference between the two words and found his answer - interestingly, he also made a &quot;clerical error&quot;. After checking several versions of &quot;Contrast Notes&quot;, Zhang Ailing wrote &quot;Garden Party&quot; Rather than a &quot;garden party&quot; - he found out from the old &quot;Declaration&quot; that on July 8, 1944, the Wang Puppet &quot;Shanghai Press Association&quot; held a party in the central square of Hartung Garden, attended by thousands of people from all walks of life. &quot;Citizen Garden Lecture&quot;, the program includes red star singing and movie card screening. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although he did not specifically mention the red star singing that night or the celebrities attending the meeting, Shao Wen determined that the red star was &quot;most likely&quot; the popular Li Xianglan, and Zhang Ailing, who is already a celebrity in the maritime literary world, &quot;naturally&quot; should also Be present. He deduced from this that it was on this occasion that Zhang Ailing and Li Xianglan met for the first time: &quot;...the first tangible and tangible meeting was at this garden party. The impression on them was profound and indelible. As the years passed, As time went by, the subsequent impressions became shallow and flat, leaving only this scratch. How many years later, in Zhang Ailing’s brain inventory, all the fate with Li Xianglan was merged into this time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;He further said that when Zhang Ailing stood on the balcony of her apartment (Eddington Apartment, today&#39;s Changde Apartment), she could see a corner of Hartung Garden. Hartung Garden can also be regarded as Zhang Ailing’s neighborhood. Zhang Ailing also mentioned this legendary garden twice in her 1944 serial &quot;Serial Set&quot; in Vientiane. &quot;Although the scale of Jin Xiongbai&#39;s private garden and Hartung Garden are not the same, there are some similarities: they are both Western-style houses with flower beds and lawns. Just based on the background of the photo and the Western-style cushion chairs, in Zhang Ailing&#39;s memory, , unknowingly, the garden of Jin Xiongbai&#39;s private residence was replaced by Hartung Garden, and the &#39;cooling party&#39; also turned into a &#39;garden party.&#39;&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s right. One thing is certain: Zhang Ailing has never mentioned and has not seen any information showing that she has been to the &quot;garden party&quot; in Hartung Gardens. Therefore, Mr. Shao&#39;s discussion based on assumptions has a strong reasoning component and is more like a It is a imaginative fiction. The mystery of forgetting is complicated and confusing, and a convincing analysis comes from Professor Wong Sham-cun, Chairman of the Department of Comparative Literature at the University of Hong Kong. In a wonderful essay, she spent six and a half pages discussing the photo of Zhang Ailing and Li Xianglan taken three weeks before Japan surrendered, and put forward a meaningful &quot;maybe&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“I don’t remember a thing in this year”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“Picture 50” in “Contrast Notes” is a picture of Zhang Ailing leaving Hong Kong in 1955 In the photo before America, the makeup is exquisite, the side face is lowered and the eyes are downcast. Eileen Chang described taking a boat from Hong Kong and passing through Honolulu. The customs officer was a skinny Japanese young man who clearly filled out her entry form: height 6 feet 6 and a half inches and weight 102 pounds. She laughed at the young man&#39;s carelessness and made a Freudian slip by writing 5 feet 6 and a half inches as 6 feet 6 and a half inches. &quot;I am thin and look very tall. That is the shocking record of this customs officer.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09 /26/g8ajGWryb6p5fYU92Aa3zTiqI33SZTgtDdLC5XE5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1267&quot; height=&quot;1738&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/g8ajGWryb6p5fYU92Aa3zTiqI33SZT gtDdLC5XE5.jpg &quot; data-key=&quot;252199&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Contrast Notes&quot; contains photos of Zhang Ailing before she left Hong Kong for the United States in 1955. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Picture 41&quot; in &quot;Contrast Notes&quot;, Zhang Ailing was &quot;careless&quot; and mistakenly recorded as &quot;1943&quot; &quot;Year&quot; frame with Li Xianglan is considered by scholars to be the most important photo of her in Shanghai. Professor Huang Xincun has a paper &quot;Mottled Light and Shadow: Zhang Ailing&#39;s Japan and East Asia&quot;, and his analysis starts from this photo. Taken on July 21, 1945, just three weeks before the end of World War II and Japan’s surrender, “Its strange composition and uncoordinated visual style are also impressive. Viewers who are familiar with the background of the photo even regard it as a depiction.” On the eve of the collapse of the Japanese Empire, a visual allegory of the crumbling Japanese-Chinese combination.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Professor Huang’s analysis of the photo focuses on the different expressions of Zhang Ailing and Li Xianglan, the strange composition of the photo, and their different dressing styles, especially It’s Zhang Ailing’s perverse sitting posture, her downward gaze away from the camera, and all the details. She said, &quot;Zhang Ailing&#39;s facial expressions and body may imply resistance or contempt, but more importantly, she obviously knows how to turn the gaze of the camera lens on her into a help to deepen her own image.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;What I am more interested in is how did Zhang Ailing, her aunt, and Yan Ying go to this &quot;garden party&quot; three weeks before Japan was defeated? Japan unconditionally surrendered on August 15, and the current situation suddenly changed. Hu Lancheng, who had been an important member of the Wang Puppet Government, was wanted by the Nationalist Government and fled hastily. How did it bring shock and panic to Zhang Ailing? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Suddenly it occurred to me that I should review &quot;Little Reunion&quot;. What happened in the long summer of 1945 is described in the book. Moreover, at the beginning of Chapter 8, what Zhang Ailing wrote about Jiuli was simply an annotation in advance for her subsequent &quot;clerical error&quot;:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;From this time until the end of World War II , for more than half a year, there was a kind of chaos in her heart, which was sealed with a layer of white wax, which was a sense of calm and security on the surface. What happened during this period was always regarded as the previous year or the next year. &quot;...I don&#39;t remember a single thing in this year. It can be called a lost year.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;When she first met him, she knew that he was going to flee after the war, but she became confused when things happened. , also because this was her &#39;lost year&#39; and she was devastated.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despondent, she banished 1945 in her heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Maybe Zhang Ailing herself doesn&#39;t want to believe that this photo was taken on the eve of Japan&#39;s defeat.&quot; Huang Xincun wrote a sentence in the &quot;Notes&quot; of the paper that is heart-stopping. Yes, there is no 1945, only 1943, only the previous year or the next year. Although &quot;Contrast&quot; was published in 1994, half a century after those unbearable and chaotic days, she still remembered that there was a kind of Freudian error. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Psychology has a lot to say about memory and forgetting. Whether Zhang Ailing left defective memories a year before her death was due to retrograde amnesia caused by damage to the hippocampus of the brain, or active forgetting of emotional memories, it is no longer a question. Of course, exploring the secrets involved is not to &quot;disenchant&quot;. As Huang Xinchun said, it is only to &quot;restore a historical Eileen Chang&quot; and &quot;a more complex Eileen Chang&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subconsciously shielding the unbearable past and deleting the dark aspects on the memory chip. Isn’t it true for us, many ordinary &quot;people&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I strongly agree with this statement: What ultimately constitutes a person&#39;s life is not experience, spirituality, or any events, but the memory, description, and interpretation of all these experiences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Matsuo Basho has a haiku: The temple bell/stopped, but the lingering sound in the flowers/continues to echo&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 23:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[二十届中央第一轮巡视完成反馈]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257717]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 22:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;According to the deployment of the Party Central Committee, the first round of inspection and feedback work of the 20th Central Committee has been completed recently. Feedback from this round of inspections is carried out through a combination of centralized feedback and &quot;one-on-one&quot; feedback from the inspection team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 19, the Central Inspection Leading Group held a centralized feedback meeting on the first round of inspections of the 20th Central Committee. The meeting conveyed and studied the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important speech when he listened to the Central Committee’s first round of inspection reports, informed the common problems discovered during the inspection, and made arrangements for rectification during the inspection. Liu Jinguo, secretary of the Central Secretariat and deputy leader of the Central Inspection Leading Group, attended the meeting and delivered a speech. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From September 20th to 22nd, 15 central inspection teams conducted &quot;one-on-one&quot; meetings with the party groups of 30 medium-sized enterprises, 5 party committees of medium-sized financial enterprises, and the party group of the State Sports General Administration during this round of inspections. feedback. According to the Central Inspection Work Arrangement, each Central Inspection Team notified the principals of the inspected party organizations of the outstanding problems discovered during the inspection, and reported the inspection situation to the leadership team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feedback pointed out that in recent years, centrally managed enterprises and financial enterprises have faced the complex and severe external environment and the impact of the epidemic. They have withstood the test and bravely shouldered heavy responsibilities. They have been successful in winning the battle against poverty and promoting high-level scientific and technological self-reliance. It has made important contributions in building a new development pattern, promoting high-quality development, coordinating epidemic prevention and control, and economic and social development, and has made new progress in building a sports power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The feedback seriously pointed out the outstanding problems existing in the fields of state-owned enterprises, finance and sports. Some fail to implement the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee, do not have a deep understanding of the responsibilities and missions they shoulder, and have gaps in their performance of duties; some do not coordinate development and safety, have weak risk awareness, and have insufficient prevention and control mechanisms; some implement party management The responsibility for party governance is not in place, the pressure transmission is decreasing layer by layer, the implementation of the strict tone is weak, the integrity risks of key positions such as &quot;top leaders&quot; are relatively prominent, the problem of &quot;depending on the enterprise to take advantage of the enterprise&quot; is common, the &quot;four styles&quot; problem is prominent, and it violates the eight central regulations Mental problems still occur; there are weak links in the construction of some leadership groups and cadre talent teams, and the political functions of grassroots party organizations need to be strengthened. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The feedback requires that the inspected units should thoroughly study Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, conscientiously study and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important speech when he listened to the inspection report, and fully implement the deployment of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Uphold and strengthen the party&#39;s leadership, firmly establish and practice a correct view of political performance, completely, accurately and comprehensively implement the new development concept, adhere to functional positioning, focus on main responsibilities and main businesses, and promote high-quality development. It is necessary to resolutely implement the political responsibility to prevent and resolve major risks, establish bottom-line thinking and extreme thinking, comprehensively sort out and investigate hidden risks, plug leaks and fill gaps, resolve risks and recover losses, and effectively safeguard national interests. It is necessary to conscientiously implement the &quot;two responsibilities&quot; of comprehensively and strictly governing the party, strengthen the effectiveness of supervision of &quot;top leaders&quot;, intensify the investigation and handling of corruption cases, seriously correct the &quot;four styles&quot; problem, deepen the use of cases to promote reform, use cases to promote treatment, and integrate We dare not, cannot, or do not want to be corrupted. It is necessary to thoroughly implement the party&#39;s organizational line in the new era and effectively strengthen the construction of leadership teams, cadres and talent teams, and grassroots party organizations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feedback emphasized that inspections and rectifications should be more serious and tough, and the strict tone, strict measures, and strict atmosphere should be passed on and carried out consistently. The inspected party organization must resolutely shoulder the political responsibility for rectification. The &quot;top leader&quot; is the first person responsible for rectification. Other members of the team must conscientiously perform &quot;one post, two responsibilities&quot;, strictly compare feedback opinions, and establish a problem list, task list, and responsibility list. Combining the problems found during the inspection with the theme education inspection issues and the problems that were not rectified in the last inspection, rectify the system and rectify the whole body, practice the &quot;two maintenances&quot; with practical actions, and reflect the loyalty and responsibility with the rectification results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The feedback requires that the responsibilities of all parties for rectification should be consolidated and efforts should be made in the same direction to solve the problem. Discipline inspection and supervision agencies must strengthen daily supervision of rectification, focus on key issues, focus on specific people and specific matters, strengthen on-the-spot inspections, grasp the real situation, and seize examples of those who deal with perfunctory or false rectifications and seriously hold accountable them. The organizational department should strengthen research and guidance based on the inspection situation, and promote the solution of outstanding problems in the construction of leadership teams, cadres and talent teams, and grassroots party organizations. Relevant functional departments must comprehensively make full use of the inspection results, strengthen daily supervision of common and deep-seated problems reflected in the inspection, deepen reforms in key areas, optimize policy supply, and improve systems and mechanisms. Inspection agencies must strengthen overall coordination and supervision, establish and improve rectification work mechanisms, and report important situations to the Party Central Committee in a timely manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is understood that the Central Inspection Team has also received clues about problems reported by some leading cadres, and has transferred them to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Supervisory Commission, the Organization Department of the Central Committee and other relevant parties for handling in accordance with relevant regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 22:55:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
