In the reception room on the basement floor, KK was discussing the process with two guest hosts, and the camera was pointed at them. An hour ago, KK had just finished an exclusive interview with Southern People Weekly. This was the third media he received that day. The chicken sandwich prepared by the organizer had been lying on the table for more than half an hour, with no intention of being opened. In 12 minutes, the signing event for his new book &quot;Precious Life Advice&quot; will begin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;KK wears a decent shirt, trousers and sneakers. He is 71 years old, with a sparse top of his head, leaving only the white hair on his temples and a white beard that stretches from his chin to the side of his face. After nearly 14 hours of flight, he arrived in Shanghai from San Francisco the night before. At this moment, even with a 15-hour time difference and being crammed into a tight schedule, the fatigue in those blue eyes only flashed past. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;KK is the abbreviation of Kevin Kelly, the founding editor-in-chief of the well-known technology magazine &quot;Wired&quot; and the author of &quot;Out of Control&quot;. Chinese readers often call him this. Kelly&#39;s most influential work in China is &quot;Out of Control&quot; written in the early 1990s. This book was once one of the must-read books for the protagonists of &quot;The Matrix&quot; (1999) before reading the script. It was called &quot;the book of the 1990s&quot; by Chris Anderson, the former editor-in-chief of &quot;Wired&quot; magazine and the author of &quot;The Long Tail Theory&quot;. One of the most valuable books of the era.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reading often and always new is one of its value expressions. If you open this book on Douban Reading, you will find that comments from readers from all over the world are densely dotted between the paragraphs. Until the ChatGPT craze in early 2023, there were still articles citing Kelly&#39;s view that &quot;machines are becoming biological, and organisms are being engineered.&quot; &quot;In releasing the power of life into the machines we create, we also lose control of them. They gain wildness, and with that wildness come some surprises and surprises. And then, that is what all creators must face The dilemma: They would no longer fully own their proudest creation,&quot; Kelly wrote in &quot;Out of Control.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The book was first published in the United States in 1995. To the public, in an era when computers were still mainly used for office work and production, the concepts such as cloud computing, blockchain, big data, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and digital currency discussed in &quot;Out of Control&quot; seemed too advanced. . This 528-page &quot;big book&quot; was not popular in the United States at that time, and it would be 15 years before it was truly &quot;born at the right time&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the second half of 2008, Kelly received a special email in his mailbox. The sender is a Chinese named Zhao Jiamin. At that time, the latter had just taken over as the general manager of the community translation platform &quot;Yiyan&quot; and was eager to explore the platform&#39;s business model. He had high hopes for translation and publishing. Which book should I start with? Zhao Jiamin thought of &quot;Out of Control&quot; recommended by a friend not long ago. It was a book that he fell in love with just by flipping through the catalog. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The year &quot;Out of Control&quot; was published in the United States, Zhao Jiamin was still an undergraduate student in the Automation Department of Tsinghua University. A few years later, he went to the University of Southern California to further his studies and received a doctorate in industrial systems engineering, and then joined Oracle to engage in technology development. For Zhao Jiamin, who has a technical background, he chose this old book not because of his optimism about its potential market value, but because the &quot;complex systems&quot; discussed in the book are a topic that he has been interested in since college. The &quot;complex systems&quot; theory emerged in the 1990s, advocating the use of interdisciplinary methods to study the unified laws behind various complex systems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In less than a morning, Zhao Jiamin made the decision to buy the rights to publish this book in China. However, Kelly did not have high expectations for how much new royalties the Chinese market could bring. Instead, it was Zhao Jiamin&#39;s idea of ​​using &quot;crowdsourcing&quot; translation that aroused his interest. Kelly once described the operation of &quot;hive mind&quot; in nature in &quot;Out of Control&quot;. Now this collaborative thinking will promote the implementation of its Chinese version, which makes him &quot;amazed&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, &quot;Out of Control&quot; was released in China much later than Zhao Jiamin expected. During this period, it went through various twists and turns, such as the integration of the collaborative translation team, the separation of Yiyan.com, Zhao Jiamin&#39;s departure and starting a new business, etc. It was already the second half of 2010 when the review was completed. Under the background of &quot;nothing to delay&quot;, this book was launched at the end of 2010. Coincidentally, it was precisely the various &quot;out of control&quot; in the early stage that made the publication of &quot;Out of Control&quot; the perfect time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2010, with the popularization of smartphones and 4G networks, China made great strides from the PC Internet era to the mobile Internet era. When &quot;Out of Control&quot; was published in China, WeChat had been launched less than two months ago, Xiaomi and Meituan had only been established for nine months, and Alibaba had just achieved sustained profitability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;That year was a typical dividing point, and China&#39;s economy was about to enter a new upward cycle. If at this time, a highly regarded book tells you that there are traces to follow in the future, then no matter what Whether it is for psychological or financial reasons, of course there will be demand.&quot; Zhao Jiamin recalled to &quot;Southern People Weekly&quot;. In the Chinese translation, the subtitle of the book was changed from &quot;The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World&quot; to &quot;The Ultimate Fate and Outcome of All Humanity.&quot; Today, Zhao Jiamin still laments that the timing of publication is rare but cannot be sought, &quot;If it had been published a year earlier, it would probably have been unknown. A year late, the moment before dawn has been missed again.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Out of Control&quot; &quot;After the publication, Kelly came to China for a week to participate in publicity. Zhao Jiamin described Kelly as one of the few foreign authors he had ever seen who was &quot;especially cooperative&quot;. The publishing team arranged more than a dozen interviews and five or six speeches for Kelly, which he readily accepted and gave his all. Relying on this round of intensive publicity, Kelly gained his first batch of readers in China and was able to establish his reputation among relevant practitioners, scholars who are sensitive to new technologies, and the media. It was precisely with this foreshadowing that &quot;Out of Control&quot; was able to catch another &quot;express train&quot; soon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2012, Kelly went to China again. At the Tencent Beijing Clubhouse, talking side by side with Kelly was Tencent CEO Ma Huateng. The latter ranked fourth on the Forbes China Rich List that year. Since 2010, Tencent has been locked in the &quot;3Q war&quot; with Qihoo 360. Just ten days before this conversation took place, both parties announced that they would file lawsuits against the other party for their unethical behavior and abuse of market dominance during the 3Q war. According to Zhao Jiamin&#39;s recollection, Tencent was in urgent need of finding a suitable guest speaker to raise its voice in this public opinion war. Zhao Jiamin recommended Kelly, &quot;He was one of the few choices at the time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of the conversation, Ma Huateng said that practitioners, including himself, were &quot;like frogs at the bottom of a well&quot; and &quot;trapped in a certain limited range.&quot; Inside, there is no way to globally observe the changes in the entire industry and the entire environmental ecology.&quot; We hope to get &quot;more forward-looking guidance&quot; from Kelly. The dialogue between the two parties covered topics such as corporate management, monopoly, personal privacy and Internet mobility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After this &quot;peak dialogue between the &#39;Future Emperor&#39; and the &#39;Product Emperor&#39;&quot; promoted by the media, Kelly and his &quot;Out of Control&quot; became famous in China. Zhao Jiamin recalled to &quot;Southern People Weekly&quot; that the sales of &quot;Out of Control&quot; jumped from a few thousand copies at the end of the previous year to tens of thousands. &quot;As a &#39;big book&#39;, this number is far beyond expectations.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Prophet&quot;, &quot;Prophet&quot;, &quot;Godfather&quot;...the titles superimposed in front of Kelly&#39;s Chinese name are becoming more and more abundant. The popularity across the ocean surprised Kelly at the time. &quot;Although the sales of this book in the United States are getting better and better, it is far behind that in China. There is little competition among books of the same type. At that time, China&#39;s Internet had just begun. At first, I was surprised that so many people could find resonance in my book.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Invitations to speak came one after another. In 2014, Kelly was invited to attend the Zhejiang Entrepreneurs Conference. In the previous two conferences, the invited foreign guests were Jim Rogers, a well-known investor who has long been optimistic about China, and John Nesbitt, the author of &quot;Megatrends&quot;. &quot;You have to believe in the impossible. The greatest product in 20 years has not yet been invented!&quot; Kelly sounded encouraging at the end of his hour-and-a-half speech. Then, four words appeared on the huge screen - &quot;You are not late (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;It&#39;s not too late to act now)&lt;/span>;! &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, Kelly had published many works such as &quot;What Technology Wants&quot; in China. He is still diligent in promoting. After leaving the large-scale business event with security personnel in Hangzhou, he rushed to Shanghai the next day to attend a book signing in a bookstore and talk to dozens of readers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of Kelly&#39;s invited public speeches are about trends, which has always been his biggest selling point in China. In 2016, &quot;Inevitability&quot; was published in China. In the book, he listed &quot;12 inevitable technological forces&quot; that &quot;will shape the next 30 years&quot;. &quot;When our use of technology is close to the trajectory preferred by technology, we will be able to manage complexity, optimize interests and We are better at reducing the harm caused by technology.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like many well-known futurists, Kelly emphasized in the preface that “these forces are not destiny, but trajectories.” However, this does not affect the ability to take &quot;Logical Thinking&quot;, who won the rights to the world premiere of the book, said in the promotional copy that it &quot;predicts which areas will have major wealth opportunities in the next 30 years.&quot; Public information shows that the paper version of the book sold more than 100,000 copies in the first month after its release. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;&quot;Out of Control&quot; is the most famous in China, &quot;What Technology Wants&quot; is regarded by Kevin as the culmination of his thoughts, and &quot;Inevitable&quot; is the output of applying this methodology.&quot; In Zhao Jiamin It seems that the greatest value of Kelly&#39;s work is not prediction, but providing a technical philosophical framework that integrates complex fields such as machines, systems, biology and society. &quot;In this sense, these books are not outdated today.&quot; , human beings&#39; understanding of technology and human nature is still full of confusion and contradictions. But compared to obscure philosophy, most people&#39;s expectations will be more utilitarian - to see the future first. This is understandable.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/B1k8KBSpzTnQT9Ec4mCteOlBadSv8RZaQUdpKRda.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data -src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/B1k8KBSpzTnQT9Ec4mCteOlBadSv8RZaQUdpKRda.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254472&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zhao Jiamin&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;New topic&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Recipient Affected by the new crown epidemic, Kelly last visited China four years ago. As of early September 2023, there are only two direct flights per week from San Francisco, where he lives, to Shanghai. &quot;There used to be several shifts every day,&quot; Kelly said with emotion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The U.S. Department of Transportation announced in August 2023 that starting from September 1, Chinese airlines will be allowed to operate 18 pairs of direct round-trip passenger flights between China and the United States every week, and from October 29 Increased to 24 pairs per week (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Note: the number in August was only 12&lt;/span>;). However, according to data from aviation data analysis company Cirium (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Ruisiyu)&lt;/span>;, the international flight capacity of the Chinese aviation industry in October 2023 The overall level was 54.7% of the pre-epidemic level; during the National Day holiday, routes to Japan, South Korea and Central Europe recovered quickly, while flights between China and the United States remained at a very low level compared with 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Normally, there are more foreigners on flights to China. I didn&#39;t pay special attention this time, but it seemed that most of the people on the plane were Chinese faces.&quot; Kelly recalled to &quot;Southern People Weekly&quot; the day before What you see on board. On the night he arrived in Shanghai on September 11, he went to the Bund specifically. The landscape lighting themed light and shadow show that he often remembered in the past was not staged, but the familiar popularity still came to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kelly came to Shanghai just a few days before the 34th Shanghai Tourism Festival. Promotional slogans - &quot;Into Beauty and Joy&quot; are hung on both sides of some main roads. In the first half of 2023, Shanghai&#39;s cultural tourism consumer market took the lead in the country in accelerating recovery. The city received 139 million domestic tourists and achieved domestic tourism revenue of 155.019 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of more than 100%. In contrast, the number of inbound tourists in the first half of the year was only 1.24 million, less than 13% of 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As Bill Gates, who also visited China again after four years in June, said, &quot;In four years, the world has undergone tremendous changes.&quot; Leaving the bustling crowd on the Bund, Kelly found himself in Another context. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to being invited to attend the 2023ESG Global Leaders Conference, another important task of Kelly&#39;s trip is to promote his new book &quot;Precious Life Advice&quot;. On his 68th birthday, Kelly began penning down some life advice for his children. In the following years, he continued to write new ones, &quot;getting pleasure from compression and decompression&quot;, and finally selected 500 pieces to be collected into a book. Different from tomes that require careful consideration of words and sentences, this booklet of about 200 pages is more in line with the &quot;short, flat and quick&quot; public reading purpose in the fragmented era. It seems that everyone can get some resonance, inspiration, or relief from it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of September 12, when I walked through the crowds queuing up to buy books and arrived at the venue, it was still 5 minutes before the official start of the event at 6:30. The theater, which can accommodate more than 700 people, is already 70% full. I was sitting in the middle of the venue. On the left was a girl holding a pink Stella Dew plush backpack. She was taking a selfie with Kelly&#39;s new book. On the right was a middle-aged man wearing a dark blue polo shirt and a primary school student of about third or fourth grade. ; In the front are an old woman with a white bun, a young woman eager to stuff tomatoes into her mouth, and a young man wearing a Hawaiian-style short-sleeved shirt with white flowers and red bottom; in the aisle, there is another man holding a The young father of a several-month-old baby paces back and forth. Even though it was a working day and a rainy day, the venue was almost full after an hour. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this conversation that lasted for an hour and a half, Xu was following the theme of his new book, and &quot;lying flat&quot; became the most common topic mentioned by the guests and questioners on the spot. In fact, Kelly is no stranger to this term. In a media interview earlier that day, he had already learned the accurate pronunciation of this Chinese word from the reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I lie down every night.&quot; Kelly joked when answering the host Dong Chenyu, a lecturer at the School of Journalism at Renmin University of China, about whether young people in the United States will &#39;lie down&#39;. He went on to mention his own experience, &quot;In the 1960s, I experienced the hippie movement. At that time, young people&#39;s &#39;lying flat&#39; was a rebellion against the existing system. In a sense, &#39;lying flat&#39; is not without value. .I often encourage people to do things when they are young that have nothing to do with society&#39;s definition of success, to do things that are a &#39;waste of time&#39; and have no immediate reward. These experiences will become your muse later in life. Of course, you will eventually You need to stand up one day, because only creating new is a rebellion against the old.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The topic did not end easily. In the question-and-answer session later, a female audience member who looked to be in her early twenties asked again, &quot;How should young people deal with the current situation of &#39;can&#39;t roll up and can&#39;t lie flat&#39;?&quot; The audience burst into laughter. After several minutes of relay translation between the two hosts, I’m not sure whether Kelly could understand the twists and turns behind this repeatedly stated question. Kelly attempts to express the inevitability of living with contradiction. &quot;So I should accept the status quo?&quot; the girl concluded, disappearing into another round of laughter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the conversation ended, I dispersed with the crowd. Several men in their 40s gathered together to discuss how they &quot;didn&#39;t enjoy themselves&quot; during the dialogue and question-and-answer sessions. They are obviously more interested in Kelly&#39;s &quot;technological prophecies&quot; than &quot;life mottos.&quot; I told Zhao Jiamin the feedback from these &quot;technical fans&quot;. &quot;Most people born in the 70s and 80s became fans of Kevin through &quot;Out of Control&quot;. The establishment of many people&#39;s technical ideological systems, including myself, was somewhat influenced by him.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ten years have passed by. &quot;Financial Eleven&quot; wrote in &quot;The Sharp Decline of China&#39;s Unicorns: Helplessness and Vitality&quot; that most of China&#39;s existing leading unicorn companies were established around 2012, and the mobile Internet, which has a low threshold for entrepreneurship, was once the best However, with the end of the mobile Internet dividend period and changes in the general environment, the necessary factors that contributed to the birth of unicorns are weakening or even disappearing. Today, investment is still strong in robotics, semiconductors and ESG (&lt; span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Environment, social and corporate governance&lt;/span>;) and other fields. People have to adapt to the new cycle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhao Jiamin can understand the differences in concerns of different groups and different stages of life. This is not a different response to anxiety. Some people hope to find opportunities on the &quot;map of the future&quot;; some people suffer from internal friction in &quot;rolling&quot; and &quot;lying down&quot; and hope to find concentration in the wise man&#39;s mottos. As Kelly said in &quot;Precious Life Advice,&quot; &quot;My suggestions are not rules. They are like hats. If one doesn&#39;t fit, try another.&quot; People are constantly &quot;trying on hats.&quot; ”, because the days are always moving forward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A well-known futurist once defined his role this way - &quot;facilitate complex conversations about the future, inspire others to think incredible things, and challenge their biases and assumptions about the past, present and future.&quot; In this sense, four years later, Kevin Kelly, a 71-year-old American futurist, will find that the high-spirited Chinese readers he was once familiar with are giving him more difficult problems. After all, there may be traces of the &quot;inevitable&quot; inner trend, but no one can give an accurate answer on how to heal the &quot;out of control&quot; present. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/djjsGL5twqf7s0xD4VNzPkUj7j89ZDG6eKEKuy89.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;639&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/djjsGL5twqf7s0xD4VNzPkUj7j89ZDG6eKEKuy89.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254475&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 15, 2017, Kevin Kelly (left) watched robot operation at the Singularity Robot Experience Hall of Zhejiang Robot Industry Group&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot; >;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Talk about direction, not destination&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font- family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What is the most interesting part of your job, and what is the most challenging? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kevin Kelly: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I don’t have a “career” in the traditional sense. I&#39;ve been very lucky to have always climbed the ladder of my interests. I am my own boss, I control my own time, and if I can do that I am one of the richest people in the world. The most challenging thing is how to take full advantage of this and create something that only I can create. As I wrote in &quot;Valuable Life Advice,&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t be the best, be the only one.&quot; I don&#39;t want to spend my limited time doing things that everyone else can do. It can be difficult, especially for young people, to figure out your relative strengths. When you are young, it doesn&#39;t matter if you can&#39;t find the exact answer, you can work towards it. This is why I like to talk about directions rather than destinations. You may never reach your destination, but you can keep moving toward it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From 20 to 27 years old, you are an independent The photographer has traveled to more than a dozen Asian countries and regions.

Gosh, I probably wouldn&#39;t believe this messenger. If I had known, I would probably have been tempted to travel less frequently, which is exactly what I wish I had done in my youth.

Your shaping? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kevin Kelly: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;If I hadn’t experienced what I experienced in Asia, I would probably be a completely different person. I have witnessed first-hand the dramatic changes that the use of new technologies has brought to people&#39;s lives there, and how third world countries that cannot feed themselves have become among the richest countries in the world. That experience cultivated my optimism and allowed me to talk about technology in a more confident way, not from a purely technical perspective, but from a technical and cultural perspective. This has also become my uniqueness. Your uniqueness is based not only on your talents, interests, and habits, but also on your experiences. So, your twenties are the perfect time to do something unusual, strange, daring, risky, unexplainable, and unprofitable. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/Rsys9OtcHHcniWm2MPlduoBfiybFRq8zST6H3dD0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;652&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/Rsys9OtcHHcniWm2MPlduoBfiybFRq8zST6H3dD0.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254480&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Kevin Kelly at the book signing event&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(CITIC Publishing Group/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt; /p>; &lt;h4>;Optimism is becoming a scarce commodity&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Originally What inspired you to write &quot;Out of Control&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kevin Kelly: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I was very early (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;1985 Before and after&lt;/span>;) came into contact with the Internet. In 1987, I heard that the first artificial life symposium would be held in Los Alamos. That seminar was a strange hybrid, involving the intersection of computers, artificial life, biology, and cybernetics. I had never seen a conference like this anywhere else and I knew I couldn&#39;t miss it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was strapped for cash at the time. After buying the air tickets, I could no longer afford the hotel. The seminar lasted three or four days. I spent the day at the venue and spent the night at a nearby campsite. The seminar held a total of about 60 speeches, and I attended all of them. The content of the speeches was very novel and interesting. Later, I compiled the key information of each speech and published it on the Internet. Although the audience was small, the response was very enthusiastic, so I came up with the idea of ​​writing a book on technology integration. This is my first book. I started writing in 1990 and it took about three years to complete. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In a period of rapid economic growth, people are full of longing for the future. Be open to hearing insights and predictions from future scholars. However, just after emerging from the epidemic, the global economy is facing downward risks. Many young people will pay more attention to the present than the future, or they can only take care of the present. How does this change affect your industry? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kevin Kelly: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;People already have too many repressed imaginations about the future, and optimism has become a scarce commodity, which makes me more optimistic. Motivated to offer an optimistic perspective, perhaps my optimistic narrative can provide a different path forward. In the 1980s, when I was young, the United States experienced a severe economic recession and many people lost their jobs and homes. When a recession occurs, we need to discern: Is the setback temporary? Is it political or technical? Is it a substantial recession or a technical recession? …Every generation goes through ups and downs, but these shall pass. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/C0YJuYxf4sn2Mhn2XYLHSbltd8mMaqFqRbWaAtRj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;646&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/C0YJuYxf4sn2Mhn2XYLHSbltd8mMaqFqRbWaAtRj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254478&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Kevin Kelly signs autographs for readers at the book signing event&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(CITIC Publishing Group/Photo)&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Future scholars need to find a certain balance between accuracy and credibility&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font -family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What are the most common misunderstandings people have about future scholars? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kevin Kelly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Just imagine going back ten years ago, if someone told you what it would be like in 2023, you would probably I don’t believe it, because the future often seems unreasonable. But if no one believes it, what’s the point of making an accurate prediction? Future scholars need to find some balance between accuracy and credibility. The picture of the future you strive to paint needs to be accurate, helpful to others, and plausible. Meeting these requirements simultaneously is not easy, so would-be scholars often find themselves in an unwinnable dilemma. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What is your strategy? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kevin Kelly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I am not trying to accurately predict the future, but to imagine the range of possibilities in the future based on scenarios and identify what is not possible. Possibility is also an important part. What I value is understanding technology trends, not predicting an accurate end point. Of course, I also accept the fact that misjudgment is a high probability event. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Human beings are both the creators and the created of technology&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, Italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Is optimism a necessity in this career? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kevin Kelly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I would like to be an optimistic futurist, but optimism is not a necessary condition for success. Many science fiction movies also fall into the futuristic category, but most of them are pessimistic and dystopian. They not only sell well at the box office, but also gain widespread cultural influence. Just like after watching the &quot;Terminator&quot; series, you will naturally worry about the fatal consequences of the future development of artificial intelligence. Too many people put too much energy into rehearsing all kinds of scary things in advance, which can make positive rehearsing seem unattainable. This is why I will work hard to paint a picture of the human world a hundred years from now. I hope to present a future world that I am willing to be in. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Optimism does not mean ignoring those technological developments &quot;side effects&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kevin Kelly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It is difficult for us to completely shield the disadvantages of technology, so I tend to look at the problem as a whole. As long as the positive effects brought by technology are 1% or 2% more than the negative effects every year, even this small progress is easily ignored at the moment, but with compound interest over decades or even centuries, this progressive Improvements converge into the evolution of human civilization. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Human beings are both the creators and the created of technology, and the tension caused by this will always exist. My optimism is not because the problem is smaller than we think, but because humans’ ability to solve problems is greater than we think. The problems caused by technology cannot be solved by reducing technology, but by better technology. If you only have a modest idea right now, the solution is never to stop thinking about it, but to keep thinking until a better idea comes along. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;However, human beings do not enjoy the technological dividends equally.

The challenge lies in determining which ethical principles AI should follow. There is no consensus yet. Large models are trained based on large amounts of data, and the original producers of these data are the general public. Large models, as a result of human &quot;averages&quot;, inevitably exhibit biases and stereotypes. People hope that AI can be better than ordinary people, but we don’t know what the moral and value standards of “better than us” are, and we don’t even have a clear definition of who “we” are. Making AI better than &quot;us&quot; is a huge undertaking, but we must have answers. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Ordinary people can learn from the thinking of futurists What did you learn from the method? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kevin Kelly: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The world is constantly changing and developing.

The leader of the coup and the former captain of the presidential guard deposed President Ba Zum stopped exporting uranium ore to France. After negotiations between the two sides failed, French President Macron announced that he would withdraw all troops stationed in Nigeria by the end of this year. How much impact will this have on the “return to Africa” strategy proposed by the French government a few years ago? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To predict this, we must first understand the concepts of &quot;French Africa&quot; ​​and &quot;CFA Franc&quot; in African geopolitics. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;French-speaking Africa&quot; ​​and &quot;African Franc&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As an old colonial power, France had nearly 13 million square kilometers of colonies at its peak, ranking second after the United Kingdom. Its colonies are mainly in Africa, and once occupied 37% of the total area of ​​Africa. Such a vast African area, with French as the official language, is called &quot;French-speaking Africa&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After World War II, the &quot;anti-colonialism&quot; movement rose around the world. France sent troops to suppress the independence movements in Indochina and Algeria. After the defeat of the war, France realized that &quot;colonialism&quot; was over and followed this historical trend. Former French colonies became independent one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the 1960s, the colonial systems of Britain and France have completely collapsed. In the &quot;post-colonial era&quot;, the relationship between the old colonial empires and the former colonies of the Third World has gradually entered the realm of equality at the international political level. era. Of course, due to uneven development in other aspects such as economy, technology, culture, society, and life, Western countries have market advantages in international commerce and trade. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 1945, the French government issued the &quot;French African Colonial Franc&quot;. Each French colony in Africa established a &quot;business account&quot; in the French Ministry of Finance and deposited all foreign exchange into this account. The fixed exchange ratio between the &quot;French franc&quot; and the &quot;Chinese franc&quot; is 1:1.7. As of 1949, France controlled 80% of the exports and 75% of the imports of African colonies through financial means. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 1958, France formulated the &quot;Constitution of the Fifth Republic&quot; and changed the &quot;French Federation&quot; to the &quot;French Community&quot;. Each member state of the &quot;Community&quot; enjoys autonomy in domestic affairs, economy, etc., but foreign affairs, defense, etc. are still controlled by France. After 1960, 12 countries in the &quot;community&quot; became independent. In 1961, the &quot;Community&quot; Senate announced its dissolution. Since then, France has maintained relatively close bilateral relations with the original Community member states in the form of bilateral treaties, trade agreements, and &quot;associated countries&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the collapse of the French colonial system, French African countries became independent one after another. The new African states banded together to negotiate with the French government.这些刚独立的法属非洲国家，于1962年组成了“西非国家货币联盟”，1972年成立了“中非国家银行”，由这两个央行系统来统一发行这些新生国家的法定货币。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;西非法郎（FCFA）：贝宁、布基纳法索、科特迪瓦、几内亚比绍、马里、尼日尔、塞内加尔、多哥等8个国家组成“西非经济货币联盟”，发行的货币称为“非洲金融共同体法郎”（俗称“西非法郎”）。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中非法郎（CFAF）：喀麦隆、中非、刚果（布）、加蓬、赤道几内亚、乍得等6个国家组成“中部非洲经济与货币共同体”，称为“非洲金融合作法郎”（俗称“中非法郎”）。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“非洲法郎区”覆盖撒哈拉以南15个非洲国家（印度洋上的岛国科摩罗，单独发行科摩罗法郎），约1.55亿人口。 “西非法郎”与“中非法郎”汇率相等，但不能相互流通。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1960年，法国发行新法郎（Nouveau Franc），确定其币值为旧法郎的100倍，相当于0.1802克含金量。法国法郎与非洲法郎之间的固定兑换比为1∶50。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1980-1990年代，非洲经济发展长期缓慢、停滞，甚至严重倒退，各国财政赤字猛增、通货膨胀严重、债务问题加剧。全球金融界普遍认为“非洲法郎”估值过高，在“世界银行”和“国际货币基金组织（IMF）”干预下，1994年，“法国法郎”与“非洲法郎”之间的固定兑换比，调整为1∶100。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1999年1月，“欧盟”承认法国与非洲法郎区的货币合作协议，批准“非洲法郎”正式与即将发行的欧元挂钩，固定汇率为（非洲法郎:欧元）655.957∶1。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;政治独立Vs经济或货币“依附”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;这些前法属非洲国家既然已实现政治独立，为何非要在经济，尤其是货币方面与法国紧密联系？原因是：这些非洲国家的社会结构和经济发展落后，其国民经济完全依赖法国。现代货币，不再是金本位、银本位或双本位贵金属定义的实体货币，而演变成国家信用符号。缺乏信用的纸币，不会得到国际社会认可，该地区的经济就会崩溃。而货币崩溃后，往往在很短时间内就会发生社会大动荡，甚至恐怖大饥荒、血腥内战。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此非洲国家发行的“西非法郎、中非法郎”不得不继续与法郎挂钩，靠法郎的国际货币地位提供信用背书，才保持了这些国家独立后几十年的大致稳定，对那里的百姓而言，更朴实的作用是较稳定的“非洲法郎”能买到粮食，有饭吃。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，法国利用法郎与“非洲法郎”之间的关系，从中获利颇丰，对二战后法国的战后重建与经济复兴，起到了重要作用。同时，“法语非洲”的黑人，也能利用自己手中的“非洲法郎”与法国法郎兑换的优势，前往法国学习、经商，产生了大批接受法国思想与文化、说法语的“非洲精英”。这使法国在“法语非洲”占有很大的思想、文化、政治、经济优势。与此同时，法国近6800万人口中，有近800万黑人（含非法移民），占比近12%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在长期合作过程中，法、非双方相互妥协：“西非国家中央银行”“中非国家中央银行”的总部，由巴黎分别迁至非洲的达喀尔、雅温得。联盟成员国将外汇存在法国央行的比例从100%调整到65%。 “西非央行”董事会7人，法国董事减为2人；“中非央行”董事会12人，法国董事减到3人，大大降低了法国权重，增加了非洲权利。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1973年，法国与“西非货币联盟”签署《货币合作协议》，确定货币合作四原则：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一、刚性兑换原则，法国确保“西非法郎”的兑换刚性。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;二、固定平价原则。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;三、自由流动原则，在“西非货币联盟”内部资金流动不受限制。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;四、外汇储备集中管理原则，西非国家外汇储备存入法国央行的比例，下调到50%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在“非洲法郎”背后，法郎的国际货币地位、信用背书、法国政府的支持（尤其是法国承诺“西非法郎”兑换刚性），对中非、西非经济的保驾护航，对维持前法属非洲地区的社会稳定存续，起到了重要作用。 1970年代，这些非洲国家的日子过得还算凑合。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1999年以后，当欧元诞生、法国法郎退出历史舞台后，“非洲法郎”转而与欧元以固定汇率挂钩。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;依托法郎与欧元的长期稳定，即使在非洲其他地区战乱四起、政变频繁、社会危机此起彼伏的动荡时代，“非洲法郎”仍保持坚挺币值。这对“法语非洲”国家维持政府存续，在非洲各地持续不断的战乱政变、经济危机、社会动荡中生存下来，起到了至关重要的作用。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与非洲其他地区相比，“非洲法郎区”避免了因货币滥发引起的通货膨胀，维持了货币信用和稳定。 2014-2017年间，全球通胀率在2.8%-3.2%之间，撒哈拉以南（“非洲法郎区”以外）通胀率从6.3%飙升到11.3%。而“非洲法郎区”的通胀率则始终保持在0.7%-1.7%之间。凭借良好的货币信誉，“非洲法郎”保持了世界上存续时间最长的固定汇率机制之纪录。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1994年，中非国家成立“中非经济与货币联盟共同体”，除货币联盟、经济联盟以外，还设立了共同体议会、共同体法院。 2000年，西非各国以西非法郎为纽带，组成了经济共同体，逐步消除联盟内部的贸易壁垒、统一关税，实现经济上的共进退。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;法国在非洲的驻军&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“冷战”结束后，意识形态冲突让位于亨廷顿所谓“文明冲突”，“法语非洲”亦不例外。大国争霸背景下的文明冲突，甚至威胁到很多非洲国家政权的存亡。 2012年，马里政府军被反政府武装打得节节败退，马里政府万般无奈，只好请前宗主国法国出兵援救，2013年，法军展开“薮猫行动”，将反政府武装赶入马里北部沙漠，帮助马里政府夺回了大部分领土。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;目前法国在“法语非洲”展开的军事行动，并非两个世纪之前“强权即真理”的殖民主义军事侵略，而是在现代国际法框架内的维稳性联盟军事行动。这类行动的特点是：需要合法政府发出正式邀请。如果所在地政权不同意外国军队继续驻扎，法军就得撤出。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;法军从尼日尔撤出，就是这类军事行动的范例：法军之前是应尼日尔合法政府邀请，前来“反恐”（维稳）。但尼日尔发生了军事政变，现政权合法性虽不足，但其发出逐客令，法军只好撤出。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;从西非法郎到埃科？ &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;法国考虑到古代的“殖民主义”一去不复返了，所谓“重返非洲”战略是指法国以现代化社会形态，重新构建与“法语非洲”在平等基础上的新国家间关系。其中首重货币，而法国做出的重大决策，是支持“法语非洲”的货币改革。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2019年12月21日，法国总统马克龙与“西非经济与货币联盟”主席达成一致，宣布准备废除“西非法郎”，2020年使用新货币“Eco（埃科）”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此次货币改革主要有三大变化：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一、废除西非法郎，使用新货币Eco。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;二、西非央行不再将50%外汇上交法国管理，可自由配置外汇组合。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;三、法国撤回并不再向“西非经济货币联盟”银行机构派驻代表。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同时，“西非法郎”改革为Eco后维持两个“不变”：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其一：Eco依然与欧元挂钩，维持655.957∶1固定汇率不变。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其二：法国对西非国家的承诺不变，如未来出现危机，可提供外汇支援。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此次“西非法郎”改革，是法国“重返非洲”战略的重要举措之一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;法国目的在于推动“西非法郎区”实行经济一体化，以便吸收法郎区之外的尼日利亚、加纳等国家加入。作为这一新的经济合作区之原创发起者与担保者，法国将在该货币联盟中具有最大话语权，成为非洲廉价劳动力和丰富自然资源的最大受益者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对“西非法郎区”国家来说：掌握货币发行权，顺应了其国内的“金融民族主义”思潮，有利于增加政府声誉、维护政权存续。而西非国家多数面积不大、经济体量较小，区域内没有经济强国为实行统一货币作担保支撑，所以必须依靠法国支持。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;未来，联盟外国家（尼日利亚、加纳）若能够满足一定的经济及其它条件，Eco不排除吸引其加入的可能性，进而建立一个更大范围的货币联盟。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很显然：法国的目标，重点在尼日利亚。尼日利亚不但有丰富的石油资源，且人口已超过2亿，保持着全世界最高生育率。有学者预测：到21世纪晚期，尼日利亚人口可能达到7亿左右，在某些学派看来“人口红利”巨大。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据协议，新货币Eco发行，需要各国达到一定的经济指标为门槛，譬如：财政赤字不超过GDP的3%、通胀在10%以内、公共负债不超GDP的70%等，对这些国家仍是考验。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;截至2022年，“西非法郎区”国家和法国官方均未宣布Eco具体推进时间表。受“新冠”疫情影响，西非国家财政收入锐减、公共开支大幅攀升、财政赤字高企，无法达到之前预设的门槛，新货币的发行将被推迟。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;法国政府在“法语非洲”和“非洲法郎区”下的这盘大棋，当然是考虑到法国利益。但这是“后殖民主义”时代的一种新安排，法国一方面维持了在这些地方的影响力，但另一方面也要出钱出力出信用，一些国家不愿意这样跟法国玩了，法国也得乖乖退出，所以法国总体上是“大哥”或“共主”的角色，有小弟不鸟这个“大哥”或不认这个“共主”，法国也没法像过去那样用强。故而我们要以新思维、新观念、新方法去审视与研究这一现象。 &lt;/p>;

British football star and Manchester United legendary star Sir Bobby Charlton passed away at the age of 86. He was the last player to survive the Munich air disaster. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bobby Charlton, who was born in 1937 and officially retired in 1976, has a career full of honors. He played 758 games for Manchester United, scored 249 goals, and won several English top league championship trophies. He was also the core player of the England team that won the 1966 World Cup. He is both offensive and defensive, his playing style is tough but not rough, and he is known as a &quot;football gentleman&quot;. He is also one of the very few players in the history of football to have won the World Cup trophy, the Champions League trophy and the Ballon d&#39;Or at the same time, collecting the highest honors at the national team, club and individual levels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 145-year history of Manchester United, many stars have emerged, but when it comes to the number one legend in history, the vast majority of fans will vote for Bobby Charlton. He is also regarded as the &quot;Chosen One&quot;. As a survivor of the &quot;Munich Air Crash&quot; of Manchester United, he not only defeated fate and himself, but also became the most critical figure in Manchester United&#39;s emergence from the haze. This is not just luck, but also a testament to hard work. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The talented young man from a football family faces the obstacle of a plane crash in his life&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Bobby Charlton was born on October 11, 1937 in Northumber, England. Lan County, his family can be called a football family: his father and uncle are both well-known local players, and his brother Jack Charlton later became a star of Leeds United and the main central defender of the England team in the 1966 World Cup. Bobby Charlton entered the Manchester United youth team when he was 12 years old. He officially turned professional in 1954 and won three consecutive English FA Youth Cup championships with the Manchester United youth team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1956, Bobby Charlton made his first-team debut for Manchester United. In this game against Charlton, he scored two goals, establishing himself in the first team at the speed of light, and won the league championship with the team in the 1956-1957 season. But what followed was the Munich air disaster. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;February 6, 1958 was the darkest moment in the history of Manchester United. At that time, Manchester United played away against the Yugoslavian powerhouse Red Star Belgrade in the second leg of the European Champions Cup quarter-finals. The two sides drew 3-3. Manchester United advanced with a total score of 5-4 over the two rounds. After the game, Manchester United players, some fans and reporters with the team planned to take a flight back to the UK. However, the plane at the time could not support the direct flight from Belgrade to England, and they had to stop in Munich for refueling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/22/UMm4zpLGNVn3UBqxNVyDhZrjABZeOx6dlzbTk39u.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;632&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/22/UMm4zpLGNVn3UBqxNVyDhZrjABZeOx6dlzbTk39u.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254832&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 30, 1966, London, England, England defeated the Federal Republic of Germany 4-2 in the World Cup final. Bobby Charlton celebrated by holding the Jules Rimet Cup high&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a result, the rested aircraft failed to take off twice due to engine problems at Munich Airport. On the third During the first takeoff, the plane lost control due to snow accumulation, crashed through a fence and crashed into a building, then broke into two pieces. One side of the fuselage collided with a truck filled with fuel and exploded. 23 of the 44 people on board died, including 21-year-old talented star Duncan Edwards, team captain Roger Byrne and many other players. In addition, there are two players who have completely bid farewell to the court due to injuries. Bobby Charlton was injured but luckily escaped death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The plane crash changed Manchester United&#39;s development trajectory. Since being coached by Matt Busby in 1945, Manchester United has prospered and many young players have stood out, including the talented youngster Duncan Edwards who later unfortunately passed away in a plane crash. The team quickly grew into a strong team in English football, first winning the league runner-up four times in five years, and then winning the league championship three times between 1952 and 1957. In the 1957-1958 season, Manchester United was regarded as the favorite for the Champions League, but the Munich air disaster brought everything to an abrupt end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the remaining days of that season, Manchester United, which was once involved in rumors of disintegration, did not miss a single game and relied on a group of young players who were temporarily promoted to play the entire season and win people&#39;s respect. Bobby Charlton also returned to the court as quickly as possible. He has experienced as much pain and hardship as anyone else. In addition to the physical pain, there is also tremendous mental pain. Fortunately, the then Manchester United star finally got over this hurdle and became a key figure in Manchester United&#39;s revival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/22/pPmFBwTZyrAvHQY9yqBG1ZT16Humc1ZLjlixOV2C.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;954&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/22/pPmFBwTZyrAvHQY9yqBG1ZT16Humc1ZLjlixOV2C.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254833&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 25, 1963, Manchester United won the FA Cup. Bobby Charlton (second from right) celebrated with his teammates&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot; >;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The core of Manchester United’s revival after the Munich air disaster&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Nearly a year after the Munich air disaster, Matt Busby came back and began to rebuild the team. The core of his team building was Bobby Charlton. In the next few years, George Best and Dennis Law, who were promoted from the youth team, also became the team&#39;s return. The backbone of the peak. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the following season, Manchester United finished second in the league. But it was not until 1963 that it won its first championship after the plane crash - the FA Cup. Among the players on the final field, only Fulks and Bobby Charlton had experienced a plane crash. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, Manchester United has officially ushered in a renaissance. In the mid-1960s, it won two league championships in three years, and defeated Portugal&#39;s Benfica in the 1967-1968 European Champions Cup final, winning the UEFA Champions League for the first time in history. To win the Champions League trophy, Bobby Charlton scored two goals in the game. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a reincarnation game. Bobby Charlton and his new teammates used the championship trophy to comfort those who passed away. Ten years ago, Manchester United was not far away from this championship trophy, but the air crash shattered their dreams and even lives. At this moment, Bobby Charlton completed his own redemption and the last wishes of his deceased teammates. Both he and Busby cut their middle fingers, soaked the trophy with blood, and lifted it again and again, chanting the name of a deceased teammate each time. This was the most touching scene in the history of the Champions League. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/22/Ar0dX4OJgRwncPkSgiMFTEP1Xyw9cgXyhkMiIdqC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;730&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/22/Ar0dX4OJgRwncPkSgiMFTEP1Xyw9cgXyhkMiIdqC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254834&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On February 11, 1958, Munich air crash survivors Bobby Charlton (left) and Ramon Wood received treatment in hospital&lt;span style=&quot;color: # aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, Bobby Charlton has gradually embarked on a downward slope of his career because he was over 30 years old, and Manchester United has gradually lost its competitiveness. But he is still the absolute main force on Manchester United&#39;s field, with eye-catching performances from time to time. After the 1972-1973 season, Bobby Charlton chose to leave. From 1956 to 1973, Bobby Charlton devoted all his youth and passion to Manchester United. He played 758 games for the team and scored 249 goals, maintaining these two team historical records for a long time. It was not until 2008 that his number of appearances was broken by another loyal legend, Ryan Giggs, and his scoring record was not broken until 2017 by Rooney. He brought three league titles, an FA Cup and a Champions League trophy to Manchester United. More importantly, he was loyal and tenacious, leading Manchester United to rise from the ashes after the plane crash. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After leaving Manchester United, Bobby Charlton also briefly played for low-level Preston and Ireland&#39;s Watford United before officially retiring in 1976. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;1&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;The backbone of the 1966 World Cup winning team&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After the Munich air disaster, Bobby Charlton used his best Quickly returned to the club&#39;s battlefield. On April 19 of that year, he was selected for the national team. This was the first time he was selected and made his debut. However, in the 1958 World Cup, Bobby Charlton always sat on the bench and did not have a chance to play for a minute. Although public opinion expressed dissatisfaction with the head coach&#39;s continued abandonment of Bobby Charlton, head coach Walter Winterbottom admitted to the newspaper that he regretted choosing Bobby Charlton to enter the final World Cup squad because he believed that the other side was still Painfully tortured by the Munich air disaster. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1962 World Cup, Bobby Charlton was once again selected for the England team and played as the main player, but the team was eliminated by the eventual champion Brazil in the rematch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/22/rDrwEdcI8gJuqZkXCE2G70ILXFdzRVqtjybVszFg.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;629&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/22/rDrwEdcI8gJuqZkXCE2G70ILXFdzRVqtjybVszFg.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254835&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On February 19, 1958, Bobby Charlton was recovering from training near home&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/ span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 1966 World Cup held in England became the best stage of Bobby Charlton&#39;s national team career. At this time, he was at the peak of his career and was the core of that England team. The team defeated the favorites Portugal in the semi-finals, with Bobby Charlton scoring twice in the game. In the subsequent final, the England team performed the most classic performance in history. Bobby Charlton, as the midfield organizer, helped the team defeat the powerful West Germany 4-2 and win the championship. At this time, Bobby Charlton was already a well-deserved core player. Although his light was overshadowed by Hurst who scored a hat-trick, anyone who knows football knows how critical he is to the team&#39;s offensive and defensive transition. He was named the best player of the World Cup for his outstanding performance. In addition, he also defeated Portuguese superstar &quot;Black Panther&quot; Eusebio in the Golden Globe Award that year, becoming the second English player to win the Golden Globe Award after Matthews. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 1970 World Cup was Bobby Charlton&#39;s fourth World Cup appearance. Although the team failed to enter the semi-finals, Charlton was still selected for the best team of the World Cup. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, in the 1968 European Championship (ie European Cup), Bobby Charlton led his team to third place, which was also the best record in the history of the European Championship for England. In May of the same year, he scored the 45th goal of his national team career in a warm-up match against Sweden, surpassing Griffiths to become the top scorer in the history of the England national team. On April 21, 1970, Charlton made his 100th appearance on behalf of the England team. From 1958 to 1970, Bobby Charlton played a total of 106 times in his national team career and scored 49 goals. The number of goals scored was second only to Rooney later. With the blessing of the World Cup championship, he is the best player in the history of the England national team. There is no doubt about the best player. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/22/oCjl7vzyXzMkusmysQy7yhFMeHloRWJ78O2ghLa9.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;642&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/22/oCjl7vzyXzMkusmysQy7yhFMeHloRWJ78O2ghLa9.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254836&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 8, 1994, Manchester United won the Premier League championship.

He is also the team&#39;s best business card. In 1994, he was knighted by the Queen of England. In 2012, he won the Laureus Sports Lifetime Achievement Award, becoming the fifth football player to win this honor. So far, a total of 6 football practitioners have won the award, and the other 5 are Pele, Cruyff, and Bayern. Ken Ball, Zidane and Wenger. In 2016, the South Stand of Old Trafford, Manchester United&#39;s home stadium, was named the Charlton Stand. He ranked 12th among the greatest players of the 20th century selected by World Football magazine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bobby Charlton has been committed to the global exchange of football. In 1988, the Chinese national junior team visited the UK and played against youth teams from many clubs. Bobby Charlton fell in love with Su Maozhen and Wu Chongwen of the Chinese national junior team at a glance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Chongwen has extremely fast speed and ghostly running position, while Su Maozhen has a model center body and confrontation ability, so Bobby Charlton invited the two to go to Manchester United for a trial training. . It is a pity that both of them suffered injuries during the trial training, and due to the institutional reasons of Chinese football at the time, they were unable to stay at Manchester United. After returning to China, Wu Chongwen soon disappeared from everyone, while Su Maozhen grew into a backbone of Chinese football and the &quot;number one golden head&quot; of men&#39;s football in the eyes of old fans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an interview with the media, Su Maozhen revealed that after retiring, he wrote letters and phone calls to Bobby Charlton, saying that he wanted to study in the UK. Sir Charlton and Manchester United were very welcoming and helped him pay the fees. Arrangements were made to enroll in the England C-level coaching course, which provided him with a lot of help. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/22/13ZZrWwWS5cAI7qK01CDhInQV4bKUEYqNJQ2lyP4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;835&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/22/13ZZrWwWS5cAI7qK01CDhInQV4bKUEYqNJQ2lyP4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254837&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 21, 2023, in the 9th round of the Premier League, Sheffield United lost 1 to 2 to Manchester United.

He is a bit thin, but in fact he has great energy and is never afraid of confrontation. His tough confrontation ability allows his delicate skills to be better utilized. He is not only diligent, agile, but also selfless, making him the perfect template for a midfielder. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/22/13ZZrWwWS5cAI7qK01CDhInQV4bKUEYqNJQ2lyP4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;835&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/22/13ZZrWwWS5cAI7qK01CDhInQV4bKUEYqNJQ2lyP4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254837&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 21, 2023, in the 9th round of the Premier League, Sheffield United lost 1 to 2 to Manchester United.

If you are a local, at least you will have a relative or friend who is in the milk tea business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This place is Pingnan County, Guigang City, Guangxi. On average, 1 in 5 people here sells milk tea. In Pingnan Normal Street, you can even make milk tea. There is a milk tea shop ten meters away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since Pingnan people opened the first milk tea shop in Guangzhou in 1999, the &quot;Guangxi Gang&quot; in the milk tea industry has continued to rise. The &quot;Guangxi Gang&quot; first learned experience and opened up the market in Guangzhou and Foshan, then continued to strengthen its own strength in Pingnan, and finally spread to all parts of the country. In 2006, Pingnan people opened more than 50,000 new milk tea shops across the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Pingnan milk tea has also become the carrier of youth for countless netizens. Some netizens who have moved overseas still remember drinking a cup of &quot;Subway&quot; mint milk tea every day in high school. Some netizens are obsessed with the taste of &quot;Dakoujiu&quot; pearl milk tea because it contains memories with their grandmother. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, in today&#39;s Pingnan streets, &quot;Subway&quot; and &quot;Dakoujiu&quot; have given way to chain brands such as Heytea and Mixue Bingcheng. The latest rising local brands in Pingnan have also embarked on a long road of imitation. On the brand list of the Pingnan Milk Tea Association, some brands have Heytea logos with afros, while others simply flip the Heytea logo from left to right. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the tide of milk tea involution, Pingnan Milk Tea seems to be lost. In 2021, the Pingnan milk tea brand accounted for 22% of the market share, which is a quarter of its peak. Most of the best-selling milk tea brands in Pingnan County on takeout platforms are well-known chain brands across the country. However, the milk tea brands launched by Pingnan County such as &quot;Relixue&quot; and &quot;Qinkou Lemon&quot; only have monthly sales of more than 1,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In order to return to the top, Pingnan County has launched the &quot;No. 1 Milk Tea County&quot; sign, but not many people buy it. Pingnan County lacks the establishment of milk tea Standard right to speak. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although the local milk tea brand in Pingnan has lost its glory, the power of the &quot;Guangxi Gang&quot; is still strong.

The deadline for feedback is November 19, 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Generally speaking, the &quot;Cash Dividend Guidelines&quot; have mainly revised three aspects: first, to further clarify the direction of cash dividends, second to simplify the mid-term dividend procedures, and thirdly to strengthen the constraints on companies that exceed their ability to pay dividends. The &quot;Articles of Association Guidelines&quot; have revised the contents of Articles 153, 155 and 156 related to cash dividends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later on the same day, in accordance with the unified deployment of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges revised the Shanghai Stock Exchange Main Board and Science and Technology Innovation Board, and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange Main Board and GEM Standardized Operation Guidelines for Cash Dividends. Public opinion solicitation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This revision is a further implementation of the China Securities Regulatory Commission’s active capital market policy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The China Securities Regulatory Commission explained that the main idea of ​​this revision of cash dividend rules is to encourage companies to formulate clear dividend policies in their articles of association on the basis of adhering to corporate autonomy, stabilize investors’ dividend expectations, and ensure that non-dividends and financial Companies with large investment scales but low dividend distribution ratios should be urged to pay dividends by strengthening disclosure requirements; facilitate the company&#39;s mid-term dividend implementation procedures and encourage companies to increase the frequency of cash dividends; strengthen constraints on companies with abnormally high dividend distribution ratios and guide reasonable dividend distribution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 27, the China Securities Regulatory Commission also regulated the behavior of shareholding reductions and introduced a &quot;linking&quot; policy between dividends and shareholding reductions, stipulating that listed companies have broken shares or net losses, or have not distributed cash dividends in the past three years. . If the accumulated cash dividend amount is less than 30% of the average annual net profit in the past three years, the controlling shareholder or actual controller shall not reduce its shareholdings through the secondary market. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The annual dividend amount exceeds the amount of equity financing&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In recent years, driven by policy guidance and supervision, the dividend situation of A-share listed companies has continued to improve. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The China Securities Regulatory Commission stated that in the past five years, A-share listed companies have paid a cumulative dividend of 8.2 trillion yuan, and the annual dividend amount has begun to exceed the amount of equity financing that year. Among them, a total of 3,291 Shanghai and Shenzhen listed companies paid cash dividends in 2022, with a dividend amount of 2.1 trillion yuan, of which 1.6 trillion yuan was distributed to domestic investors, a year-on-year increase of 22.7%, and the number of dividend companies accounted for 67.1%. The dividend payout rate (32.5%) and dividend rate (1.97%) are in the middle and upper reaches compared with major global capital markets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Yang Delong, chief economist of Qianhai Kaiyuan, also told Southern Weekend reporters that the cash dividend performance of A-share listed companies has improved significantly compared with ten years ago, and listed companies also hope to enhance investor confidence through cash dividends. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this revision, the &quot;Cash Dividend Guidelines&quot; have detailed regulations and explanations for companies that &quot;evade&quot; dividends and &quot;excessive&quot; dividends. The dividend distribution procedures have also been optimized. The revisions mainly include three aspects: &lt; /p>; &lt;p>;First of all, it is necessary to further clarify the direction of cash dividends and promote an increase in the level of dividends. The first is to strengthen institutional constraints on companies that do not pay dividends and urge them to pay dividends. For companies that have not distributed cash dividends, disclosure requirements will be strengthened. In addition to disclosing specific reasons, they must also disclose the next steps to be taken to enhance investor returns; second, focus on companies with large financial investments but low dividend levels. Pay attention and urge to increase the level of dividends and focus on the main business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, we should simplify the mid-term dividend distribution process and promote further optimization of the dividend method and rhythm. Encourage companies to increase the frequency of dividends when conditions permit, so that investors can share company growth dividends earlier. Combined with regulatory practice, listed companies are allowed to review and approve the conditions and upper limit for the next year&#39;s interim cash dividend within a certain amount when convening the annual shareholders&#39; meeting to review the annual profit distribution plan. Subsequently, the board of directors will formulate a specific interim dividend plan to facilitate the company&#39;s further improvement. The frequency of dividend payments allows investors to better plan capital arrangements and share corporate growth dividends earlier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We must once again strengthen the constraints on companies that pay dividends beyond their capabilities and guide reasonable dividend distribution. First, it is emphasized that when listed companies formulate cash dividend policies, they should comprehensively consider their own profitability, capital expenditure arrangements and debt repayment capabilities, as well as investor returns and company development needs; second, it is emphasized that supervision should be carried out on companies with high asset-liability ratios and cash from operating activities. Companies with poor flow and large proportions of cash dividends should pay close attention to prevent adverse effects on the company&#39;s production, operations and debt solvency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This revision also combines the reform of the independent director system and deletes the relevant requirements for independent directors to express opinions in the &quot;Cash Dividend Guidelines&quot;. At the same time, the adaptability regulations have been modified in conjunction with the registration system reform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Although cash dividends do not directly increase shareholders’ equity, they are of particular significance to the entire A-share market.” Yang Delong explained that cash dividends on the one hand show that the company has profitability and that there is real money in the account; This aspect shows that the company has sincerity and social responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Delong previously wrote that in the A-share market, some listed companies are profitable but do not pay dividends for a long time, which harms the interests of small and medium investors. The China Securities Regulatory Commission has adopted specific regulations to encourage listed companies to pay cash dividends and strengthen inquiries on companies that have not paid cash dividends for a long time. This will help boost investors’ confidence in listed companies. It also urges the management of listed companies to make the company bigger and stronger, and encourages Major shareholders bind the interests of small and medium-sized investors through cash dividends to promote the establishment of a good ecosystem in the A-share market and the overall improvement of the quality of listed companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;There is still room for improvement&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When issuing the revised instructions, the China Securities Regulatory Commission also emphasized that “compared with mature overseas markets, the balance, timeliness, and Stability needs to be further improved, investors&#39; sense of gain needs to be enhanced, and some companies pay abnormally high proportions of dividends, which may damage debt solvency and continued operating capabilities, requiring timely guidance and regulation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Changjiang Securities is also in the process. A 2023 research report stated that A-share dividend strategies have performed better in recent years, but from a global perspective, there are still differences with overseas mature markets in terms of dividend levels, high dividend yield sectors, and the stability of dividend strategies. The difference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of willingness to pay dividends, the total amount of dividends paid in the A-share market has maintained a high growth rate, and the proportion of dividend-paying listed companies has increased year by year. It has a strong dividend investment foundation, but the sustainability and growth of dividends are still inconsistent with There is a certain gap in developed markets such as the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of dividend payout ratio and dividend rate, the Hong Kong market in China is the highest as a whole, and the willingness to pay dividends and dividend rate levels of A-share listed companies are generally in the middle, while the U.S. market is relatively the lowest, with the dividend payout ratio of A-shares in 2022 being about 32.5 %, and the dividend yield is about 1.9%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of dividends, A-share dividends are mainly concentrated on the Shanghai Stock Exchange main board, and central and state-owned enterprises pay greater dividends. Dividends in Hong Kong stocks mainly come from state-owned enterprise stocks, and the total dividends paid by local companies in Hong Kong do not account for a high proportion. Among U.S. stocks, the New York Stock Exchange’s total dividends dominate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of dividend time and frequency, the frequency of dividends in the A-share market is mostly once a year, and the actual time of dividend distribution is mostly concentrated between May and July. The average number of annual dividends for Hong Kong stocks is about 1.5 times, and it is mostly used for U.S. stocks. Quarterly dividend payment method. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Compared with U.S. stocks, the cash dividend ratio of A-shares is still low.” Yang Delong said that many companies in the United States repurchase and then cancel their shares to reward investors. Although the number of repurchases and cancellations in the A-share market has increased, in terms of proportion and amount, it is far lower than that of U.S. stocks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Yang Delong&#39;s view, cash dividends plus share repurchases and cancellations are the best way to reward investors and are also a direction for future market reform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Yang Delong believes that the dividend mechanism of A-shares can be further increased in guidance and mandatory in the future, especially for listed companies with financing needs, requiring them to pay dividends in excess of the IPO financing amount before they can again Financing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This can put certain restrictions on the company&#39;s financing behavior and allow it to truly give back to investors instead of constantly asking the market for money.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 22 Oct 2023 17:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[内塔尼亚胡的司法改革：以色列的安全保障还是“拆家怪兽”？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259029]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-22 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/RVVt5EKyjeJxmmWobYb73JO8APo0UNnqS9BmFTCf.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/RVVt5EKyjeJxmmWobYb73JO8APo0UNn qS9BmFTCf. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254449&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On January 1, 2023, in Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu cried during a visit Wall to commemorate the swearing-in of Israel&#39;s 37th government.

It has always occupied the absolute initiative in the Palestinian-Israeli and even Jewish-Arab conflicts and has a sense of security. Israel was caught off guard. The attack in just a few hours resulted in the death of more than 1,400 Israeli soldiers and civilians, and the abduction of at least 155 people. Although Israel&#39;s subsequent air strikes, shelling, blockade and other retaliations cost Gaza nearly 3,000 lives, Hamas&#39;s armed forces have ceased their activities. Israel&#39;s retaliation has increasingly attracted strong international reactions, which has greatly weakened Israel&#39;s &quot;terrorist attack victims&quot;. &quot;the image of the person&quot;. Not only that, the casualties, losses and frustrations caused by the &quot;Aqsa Flood&quot; are unprecedented in Israel since its founding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some analysts believe that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (Benjamin Netanyahu) has always advertised the &quot;judicial reform&quot; that &quot;will bring the greatest safety factor to Israelis&quot;, which has a negative impact on Israel&#39;s attack by Hamas this time. He bears an unshirkable responsibility for invading the mainland and &quot;beating the country&quot;, but Netanyahu himself and his die-hard supporters still insist that &quot;judicial reform&quot; is Israel&#39;s &quot;security guarantee.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what is &quot;Netanyahu&#39;s judicial reform&quot;? Is it Israel&#39;s security guarantee or a &quot;house-destroying monster&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/JI66Q1RpbnwQl5tYA1Z3AdWCdhxR6jCv9c4B6k2S.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/JI66Q1RpbnwQl5tYA1Z3AdWCdhxR6jCv9c4B6k2S.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254448&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 10, 2023, rockets fired towards Israel were photographed in Gaza City&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/ span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;What is &quot;Netanyahu&#39;s judicial reform&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Netanyahu has always been a polar figure in Israeli politics and the international community because of his extremely conservative and hard-line stance. Controversial role. Having stepped down after several elections, he relied on the particularities of Israel&#39;s electoral system and parliamentary composition, and by co-opting several small Jewish parties and fundamentalist parties that were more &quot;right&quot; than the Likud Party to which he belonged, and repeatedly succeeded in making comebacks and winning the election. The government has been reorganized, but the relatively independent Israeli judicial system has posed a more persistent threat to it than the opposition parties: After returning to the prime minister&#39;s seat in November 2022, he will still have to face at least three criminal charges in the judicial system, including corruption. , abuse of power, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to once and for all weaken the judicial system&#39;s ability to constrain administrative power and ensure the authority and continuity of his governance, Netanyahu proposed &quot;judicial reform&quot; as early as during his last administration. After taking office, he systematized, theorized and put it into action. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2023, Netanyahu proposed &quot;five measures to reform the Israeli judicial system and the balance of power&quot;, including changing the selection method of judges; reforming the nature of legal advisors to government ministries; and reviewing the Basic Law Change of powers; empower the Parliament to reject the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the Basic Law; abolish the legal basis for Israeli courts to interfere with administrative decisions of administrative agencies on the grounds of “unreasonableness”; remove the Supreme Court’s power to review and veto government administrative orders, stipulating that as long as the Parliament simply A majority can override this veto. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These measures can be said to be extremely damaging to the judicial system. Take changing the method of selecting judges as an example: the existing nine members of the Judicial Selection Committee include three Supreme Court judges, two representatives of the Bar Association, two MPs and two ministers, the appointment of all judges requires a simple majority of the Judicial Selection Committee, and the selection of Supreme Court judges requires the approval of at least 7 people, which means that for the selection of ordinary judges, the 5 people in the judicial system have a lot of confidence in the selection of the Supreme Court. In the selection of judges, the three Supreme Court judges have the power of blocking with one vote. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Reform&quot; proposes to expand the Judicial Selection Committee to 11 people, including the Minister of Justice (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Chairman&lt;/span>;) , two other ministers designated by the government, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Constitution, Law and Justice, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on State Control, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee, the President of the Supreme Court, two other Supreme Court Justices elected from among the judges and the Minister of Justice. With two public representatives, one of whom is a lawyer, the parliament and the government will control 7 of the 11 votes on the Judicial Selection Committee and have almost complete control over judicial personnel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, &quot;Netanyahu&#39;s judicial reform&quot; also attempts to weaken the prosecutor general&#39;s judicial decision-making power and transfer power to the cabinet and ministers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/ZqE71W0Je4E4iVyWNFyPb3BYoTz26LPojsvISGKW.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/ZqE71W0Je4E4iVyWNFyPb3BYoTz26LPojsvISGKW.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254451&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On March 27, 2023, people participated in protests on the streets of Tel Aviv, Israel, against Netanyahu&#39;s judicial reforms&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;( Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since Israel has always adopted a very special proportional representation system + cabinet system since the founding of the country, there are many small parties in the parliament. Since the founding of the country, no party has ever been able to rely on a simple majority in the parliament. Obtaining the right to form an independent government, even if the coalition government has little advantage in the parliament (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For example, during the &quot;Aqsa Flood&quot;, the current Netanyahu government &quot;Previously, it only held 65 of the 120 seats in the parliament. The &quot;emergency and war government&quot; that was hastily established after the incident only had 76 seats, of which the Likud group only had 32 seats.&lt;/span >;), often just a few seats are enough to change the &quot;color&quot; of the Israeli cabinet. Therefore, some small far-right, fundamentalist parties with only one or two seats have become &quot;kingmakers&quot; by conditionally supporting Netanyahu. Niyahu and Likud formed a government, pushing the latter, already far right, even further to the right. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The judicial reform came about because Netanyahu and the &quot;kingmakers&quot; hit it off, because through this &quot;reform&quot;, Netanyahu can only rely on single-digit parliamentary seats. Advantages and get rid of the &quot;hunting&quot; of the judicial system, while the far-right and fundamentalist small parties can use the identity and principles of &quot;kingmakers&quot; to achieve &quot;small snacks&quot;, relying on very few seats and votes to make the entire Israeli policy and rule of law Moving in the direction of conservatism, fundamentalism, and Jewish dominance as they envision it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because this &quot;reform&quot; will completely break the balance of the power structure under Israel&#39;s unique system, it will not only give the cabinet and prime minister more unfettered power, but also give small far-right parties with only a few seats It can more easily &quot;hijack&quot; the national economy and people&#39;s livelihood strategies, and even the way society operates, so even within the Likud group, many people disagree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to Netanyahu himself, those who actively promote &quot;reforms&quot; include Justice Minister Yariv Levin, a right-wing cadre of the Likud Group, and Chairman of the Zionist Party (Religious Zionist Party) Simcha Rotman, and the very active group behind it is the &quot;Kohelet Forum&quot; composed of far-right figures from the United States and Israel. The forum&#39;s platform is billed as &quot;ensuring Israel&#39;s future as a Jewish nation-state, strengthening representative democracy, and expanding Israel&#39;s personal freedoms and free market principles.&quot; However, it is actually a group full of fundamental religious overtones. There are only about 130 core members of this group, but they operate dozens of large projects and hundreds of small projects. These plans are uniformly code-named &quot;Barkat Plan&quot; (Barkat Plan), named after the core member of the forum and former Netanyahu Named after Nir Barkat, economic minister in Hu’s cabinet, the aim is to “increase the Jewish population in the biblical heartland of Judea and Samaria” – which means implementing more extreme policies than Netanyahu’s, not just in Settlements are being expanded on Palestinian lands, and Palestinians from these lands must be driven away to make room for Jewish expansion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because of this, these organizations and individuals are even more determined, tough and extreme than Netanyahu in promoting &quot;Netanyahu&#39;s judicial reform&quot;. Netanyahu has repeatedly criticized various They were pressured to make compromises, but were met with angry resistance from these &quot;teammates&quot; every time. In March 2023, the &quot;reformists&quot; passed legislation that significantly raised the threshold for Netanyahu&#39;s impeachment; in July, when the opposition collectively withdrew, they passed a law that abolished the &quot;unreasonable principle&quot; and The first step of &quot;judicial reform&quot; was completed, and in such an important and critical judicial vote, which Netanyahu hailed as &quot;a manifestation of the people&#39;s will&quot;, Netanyahu only received 64 votes, which was less than a simple majority (&lt; span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;61 votes&lt;/span>;) only 3 more votes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/0IlQCOc8MmmoloUfCq7g6A0MCwyplOl6ZrhyQaMp.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/0IlQCOc8MmmoloUfCq7g6A0MCwyplOl6ZrhyQaMp.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254452&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 7, 2023, in Gaza City, Palestinians boarded an Israeli military vehicle&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Roaring wave of protests&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Since November 2022, large-scale protests against &quot;Netanyahu&#39;s judicial reform&quot; have been held regularly every weekend in Israel. The scale of the rallies has escalated again and again. Ironically, it was the Hamas attack that broke this continuity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Netanyahu’s opponents say the reforms will seriously undermine the country’s democracy by weakening the judicial system, which is the only instrument limiting the government’s exercise of power. They pointed out that &quot;judicial reform&quot; will ultimately protect Netanyahu, who is currently on trial for alleged corruption, and give the Israeli far right more &quot;lawless&quot;, unfettered and unchecked power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth mentioning that the protestors’ camp includes many members of the military, intelligence, constitutional, special and other key departments that are crucial to the security of Israeli society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Lesley Stahl, a reporter for the CBS political commentary TV magazine &quot;60 Minutes&quot; visited Israel in mid-September 2023, he discovered that tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people had been organizing weekend weekend demonstrations for 37 consecutive weeks. One of the most influential organizations in the judicial reform protest rally is the &quot;Brothers and Sisters in Arms&quot; (Brothers and Sisters in Arms), which is composed entirely of reservists. Ron Scherf, one of the founders of this organization, pointed out that &quot;judicial reform&quot; will Allowing the far right to provoke the Palestinians more unscrupulously will worsen the security situation in Israel, which will put Israeli reservists who are often called to serve in dangerous situations all year round. The organization said an increasing number of Israeli reservists are expressing their dissatisfaction with &quot;judicial reforms&quot; by refusing to fulfill their reserve obligations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 28, 2023, Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi said that “judicial reform” has a profound impact on the military. He told the Times of Israel that “a battle within Israeli society” Arguments that leave polarizing rifts are dangerous,&quot; warning that &quot;given the security challenges, allowing such polarizing debates is arrogant, and assuming that the IDF is immune to damaging polarization is a dangerous concept.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The large-scale boycott of reservists from fulfilling their obligations began after the Knesset passed the first part of the &quot;judicial reform&quot; in July. Due to Israel&#39;s small country and high military pressure, including elite commandos, fighter pilots and other front-line combat forces, Both rely heavily on serving reservists for maintenance. On October 2, Motasem A Dalloul Abujomaa, a writer for the Canadian &quot;Middle East Observer&quot; magazine, quoted a September report from the Israel branch of the Associated Press and pointed out that the Israel Defense Forces are &quot;the most well-equipped and powerful force in the Middle East.&quot; The military is facing one of the most serious attacks it has ever faced - an internal battle, &quot;as rifts caused by &#39;justice reform&#39; seep into the ranks,&quot; the report noted, adding that hundreds of New conscripts also refused to serve in protest against &quot;judicial reform,&quot; leading the article to assert that &quot;it is clear that the army is likely to be caught unawares if any tensions arise&quot;—a prediction that only passed It will be fully redeemed within 5 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Netanyahu’s opponents pointed out that in order to ensure that “judicial reform” received unreserved support from the far-right and small fundamentalist parties, Netanyahu intensified his efforts to impose restrictions on the Palestinian areas after returning to power. High-pressure and even provocative practices, including repeatedly threatening military action against Gaza, assassinating leaders of Hamas and other radical organizations, &quot;targeted killings&quot; of buildings suspected of being resistance strongholds, and demanding that Qatar and other Middle Eastern countries stop providing humanitarian assistance to the poor people in Gaza. , stop paying for fuel for Gaza’s only power plant, require Egypt to tighten restrictions on the Rafah crossing, and stop trade between Gaza and the Israeli mainland, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to Gaza, Netanyahu has also continued to carry out &quot;forced demolitions&quot; in the Palestinian Authority areas of the West Bank, &quot;carried out actions&quot; in sensitive hot spots, expanded and built new settlements, and the West Bank is not Hamas-controlled areas. Opponents further pointed out that these actions have aggravated the conflict between Palestine and Israel and increased Hamas&#39;s support among Palestinians to an unprecedented high. And if it were not for the need to canvass votes for &quot;judicial reform,&quot; Netanyahu would have rarely been so &quot;high-minded&quot; in his previous long political career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/cyCoEHF6ZAWZH5KcAWIAE6MNAl0F5vKOU3YJ5hdb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/cyCoEHF6ZAWZH5KcAWIAE6MNAl0F5vKOU3YJ5hdb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254450&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 16, 2023, at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the Security Council voted on a draft resolution drafted by Russia on humanitarian issues in Gaza.

It also caused Israel to suffer the worst attack since the founding of the country. Heavy casualties in a single day and the homeland was attacked. At such a price, it is not just Netanyahu and the administration that have been damaged. The defense forces, intelligence and police systems are also deeply humiliated. Subjectively, the theory of &quot;letting go&quot; may not be credible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen from the performance of the conflict in southern Lebanon and the last two Gaza battles that the combat strength of the Israel Defense Forces is declining, and Israel’s intelligence capabilities rely more on information from the “Jewish world” spread across various industries. terminal, but due to Israel&#39;s long-term policy of &quot;isolating&quot; from Gaza and Hamas, it has lost the &quot;grey zone&quot; cover necessary for intelligence collection and analysis in the Gaza Strip. In addition, Hamas often adopts more primitive communication methods and With a more &quot;flat&quot; organizational system, it is reasonable for the Israeli intelligence agencies to turn a blind eye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The damage caused by the &quot;Aqsa Flood&quot; to Netanyahu and his judicial reforms is also heavy and far-reaching. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As Israeli political analyst Akiva Eldar and others have pointed out, Netanyahu has long been promoting judicial reform by creating a &quot;choose me is to choose security&quot; to win votes for himself The biggest reason is to &quot;consolidate the election results and maintain the security of Israelis&quot;, but now all of this has been completely impacted by the &quot;Aqsa Flood&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An Israeli public television commentator pointed out in the program that Netanyahu advertised &quot;security&quot;, but after the Hamas attack, he delayed for five days before forming an &quot;emergency unity battle&quot; that included the opposition. &quot;If it were other countries, this process would only take 48 hours,&quot; and the Israeli cabinet did not even hold an emergency meeting on the day of the incident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now even many Israelis who have always supported Netanyahu and favored &quot;judicial reform&quot; are beginning to feel hesitant. Rabbi Eliezer Moshea, a Jewish cleric in the Old City of Jerusalem, said that he had been frustrated because of Netanyahu. Niyahu has repeatedly allocated funds to rabbinical schools and enthusiastically supported him and &quot;judicial reform&quot;, but &quot;when our children are being slaughtered and our women are raped, he is helpless, what use can he use the money he gives to the yeshiva?&quot; He has proven unfit to lead this country.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even Michel Ben-Ami, the director of the office responsible for social issues within the Likud Party, told AFP that the &quot;accountability group&quot; established after the war was aimed at the government and Netanyahu. &quot;Investigation committee&quot; is inevitable. &quot;If he makes a mistake, he will have to pay the price for it.&quot; He believes that &quot;accountability investigation is inevitable and is the consensus of the Likud Group today.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;September 27 On March 1, less than two weeks before the &quot;Aqsa Flood&quot; occurred, the Jewish People&#39;s Policy Institute (JPPI) released the &quot;2023 Annual Assessment&quot; stating that &quot;about 37% of Israelis currently hold or plan to obtain foreign passports and intending to immigrate,&quot; arguing that &quot;this alarming figure highlights the deepening crisis in Israel and raises questions about the country&#39;s ability to recover,&quot; and directly placed the blame on &quot;Israel&#39;s judicial reforms and Turbulence in Religious and National Sphere”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report states that the comfort level of Israelis living in Israel has dropped sharply in the past year, with the proportion of people who feel uncomfortable soaring from 20% to 32%, while those who feel comfortable have dropped from 76% to 65% %. Even among supporters of the traditionally more cohesive right, their comfort level dropped from 55% in February 2023 to 43% in July. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nearly 40% of Israelis have considered obtaining a foreign passport and leaving the country, a significant portion of the population, and this number is even higher among conservative Israelis and individuals who themselves hold foreign passports Higher - It must be pointed out that the above data were obtained before the &quot;Aqsa Flood&quot; occurred, otherwise it might be even worse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, many analysts believe that Netanyahu is unlikely to weaken or cancel the intensity of &quot;judicial reform&quot; due to these pressures and setbacks. On the contrary, he is more likely to &quot;brade the wind&quot; to &quot; The reason for &quot;Israel needs a higher security factor&quot; has become even stronger - because if he does not do that, his political life is destined to enter a countdown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 22 Oct 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[不要让县中继续败给“超级中学”丨议教]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259065]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-22 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/22/6kr682xhlhaoattdgoedkgvaown8u2ldwqlomfm.jpg &quot;border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 1192 &quot;&quot; height = &quot;795&quot; data-src = &quot;// images.infzm.com/medias/ima/ima GE/23/10/22/6KR682xhlhaoattdgoedkgvaon8u2ldwqlomfm. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254820&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;February 12, 2017, No. 4 Middle School in Jianhe County, Guizhou. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Leave a message in the comment area for a chance to win a signed book from the author&lt;/span>;&lt; /strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, county education as a whole has gradually entered the vision of academic researchers, policymakers and the public, and has become an important issue of social concern. The latest hot topic is whether small rural schools should continue to exist and invest resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;County education is exactly what our Central China Village Governance Research Team partners and I surveyed in counties and townships in many provinces across the country from May 2017 to June 2023. Previously, apart from a few interviews with primary and secondary school teachers, the Huazhong Rural Governance Research Team rarely touched on rural education issues. Until our research expanded to rural governance and rural sociology, rural education became an important part of investigating and writing village governance reports. Around 2017, rural education became an independent research topic, and our research scope expanded from rural areas to the entire county. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years, our research targets include county and township schools, families, education management departments and grassroots society, trying to analyze a series of emerging phenomena: why the phenomenon of accompanying mothers in county towns is prevalent, and what will happen to them ? What impact do mobile games and online novels have on children in counties and villages? What role does the super high school play in the county? Why have non-teaching tasks in schools increased significantly? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After analyzing these phenomena, we must think about, where is the way out for county and township education? I would like to begin by stating our conclusions. After conducting research in so many places, we have always believed that in the end, it is the county that carries the hope of most children in the county and township. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;A &quot;lose-lose&quot; battle&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Compared with cities, counties are a weak and complex space, which is characterized by weak resources and poor environment in education. complex. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of county education, the development status of county high schools is the most important concern for the development of county education. If the county collapses, local people will lose confidence in the area&#39;s education, thus accelerating population migration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The current county is indeed facing a development crisis, and one of the biggest threats comes from &quot;super high schools&quot;. Super middle schools rely on their own advantages in running schools to attract high-quality students and teachers from the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some super middle schools will organize preliminary examinations for outstanding students in counties and cities across the province before the high school entrance examination, go to village communities to persuade parents of outstanding students, or entrust some primary and secondary school teachers to serve as students in advance jobs, attracting experienced teachers in the county to leave their jobs through high salaries, etc. The cross-regional enrollment of super middle schools has gradually eroded the basic structure of county middle school student training - the running of schools in county schools has been forced to adopt some short-term strategic behaviors through constant self-exploitation, such as running out of time. Investment, excessive tilting of high-quality resources to a small number of seed players, and even sending students to some well-known high schools for &quot;training&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The choice among these counties is inappropriate and helpless. The helplessness is that the super middle school relies on its multiple advantages to carry out dimensionality reduction attacks on the county. However, this blow has produced a &quot;lose-lose&quot; result: the county is under increasing pressure due to the loss of high-quality resources; the super middle school has become excessively involved due to the gathering of excellent students, and the relationship between students has become tense and psychological problems have arisen. There are more and more students, and the competition pattern has shifted from reasonable scope to competitive polarization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other side of county high school education, the development of county secondary vocational education is also facing many difficulties. On the one hand, the &quot;diversion from general vocational education&quot; policy has increasingly caused anxiety among parents. Most parents generally still cannot accept their children going to secondary vocational schools. In order to avoid falling into the bottom 50% in the high school entrance examination, they try every means to improve their grades. However, for students who go to vocational schools, parents Then there is not much hope for the development of students. On the other hand, secondary vocational schools have poor student training quality due to factors such as weak student foundations, lack of professional teachers, and inadequate facilities and equipment, making it difficult to respond to market demand and social doubts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the state has gradually increased its investment in secondary vocational schools, due to structural difficulties, the development of secondary vocational schools, especially county secondary vocational schools, is struggling. Some secondary vocational schools are struggling to explore amidst the difficulties. The road to survival and development. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“Cities are crowded and villages are empty”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the context of population migration, what kind of education do rural families need? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking down from the high school, the development of county junior high schools and primary schools shows two extremes: &quot;cities are crowded and villages are empty&quot;. Under the pressure of the government&#39;s &quot;education new city&quot; construction and social education competition, the urbanization of education The pace of education is accelerating, and rural students continue to transfer to urban schools. The county has accepted a large number of students from rural areas. However, because the livelihood model of rural families of &quot;part-time work and part-farming&quot; has not changed, and the county cannot handle the daily care tasks of rural students after they go to the city, this task has to be borne by the families themselves. This increases the cost for rural families to study in cities. On the other end of the spectrum, a large number of small rural schools have too few students. It is already difficult to maintain normal student training, and normal interactions among peers cannot be guaranteed. How can we teach and educate people and make adults successful? Moreover, the scattered resource layout has restricted county-level education. The government’s effective integration of county educational resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rural primary and secondary schools not only face the problem of whether and how to integrate resources, but also face the problems caused by the fragmentation of rural families. Problems such as left-behind children, divorce, and &quot;running mothers&quot; have caused a lack of family education for rural teenagers and brought a series of challenges to school education. When schools face children from broken families, they need to spend more time and effort than children from normal families. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Family education is lacking. Schools must first change students’ living habits and then guide students to learn. Due to insufficient family education, the foundation of students in rural primary and secondary schools is weaker than that of urban students, and the number of outstanding students is also smaller. For township junior high schools, a very specific issue worthy of discussion is whether key classes should be allocated. Should education be fair, should there be no discrimination or should students be taught in accordance with their aptitude? If there is no distinction in teaching, and all students are divided into classes in a balanced manner, the few outstanding students in each class may be biased by the underachievers with poor habits; if students are taught in accordance with their aptitude, and students are classified into different types of classes, they may suffer To raise social questions and policy accountability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Workers in rural primary and secondary schools often have to face such dilemmas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The school is still a quagmire, and the quaint nature of primary and secondary schools in the county can be seen from the phenomenon of campus bullying. The occurrence of school bullying has the influence of family education, but it is more the result of the interaction of peer groups in the school structure. If the school forms a just order on campus, it can better suppress the occurrence of campus bullying; if the just order of the school breaks down, students can only rely on the self-built jungle order for interpersonal interactions, and the phenomenon of strong bullying of the weak will occur. Unfortunately, a large number of schools are subject to strict restrictions and cannot easily impose some of the deterrent penalties of the past on students who violate regulations and disciplines, making it more difficult to rebuild campus order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The spread of network technology and the popularization of smartphones have caused serious Internet addiction among rural teenagers, which has further increased the difficulty of education management for front-line education managers in counties. For example, a girl told us that an online novel describing various crimes went viral among her classmates. We checked and found in the relevant comment area that the concepts of &quot;society is a dark forest of conspiracy&quot;, &quot;others are hell&quot; and &quot;evil is justified&quot; are quite common among readers of this novel. This book has been banned by the school, but students are still circulating it privately. Even if you don&#39;t read it at school, you can&#39;t help but take a look when you go home during the holidays. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Adolescent children have unique spiritual needs at this stage. We found that when children read novels during this period, they are not absorbing knowledge, but looking for themselves and the power to grow. They easily bring themselves and their experiences of real life into the novels they read. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Upward Hope&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Under the extremely complex educational situation, administrators and front-line teachers of schools at all stages in the county are still working hard to explore and make positive changes . They try to guide, educate and change children from broken families, children who violate the rules, and children who are psychologically fragile. They want to provide a quiet learning environment for rural children, but they are often restrained by rigid rules. In particular, they also need to resist being &quot;sieged&quot; themselves. Various non-teaching jobs squeeze their educational time, forcing them to cry out for &quot;please give teachers a quiet teaching environment.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So far, we have seen more of the embarrassing side of county education, but in front-line surveys we have also seen that county education also has positivity and hope. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to race against time and gain study time, some children only give themselves 20 minutes to eat, some carry notebooks with them on the way to eat, and some stay up late to read and work hard day and night. When we look at them with sympathy, they look back with determination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also some teachers who, in order to reduce the negative impact of students’ family factors, often accompany, listen and give them care. Huang Huaju, an outstanding class teacher at Yushan Middle School in Longhui County, Hunan Province, implemented the &quot;accompanying education method&quot; based on the characteristics of rural students. She observed an introverted girl with poor grades and later learned that the student had run away from home due to domestic violence from her mother. Teacher Huang often talks to the girl and invites her to have dinner with her. He expresses his &quot;preference&quot; and helps the girl build her self-confidence in various ways. There are many teachers Huang in rural schools, and they will explore various educational methods that are beneficial to the growth of students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some school administrators dare to reform, try to activate teachers and students, and reverse the decline of school development. A township school in Chengdu, Sichuan, once ranked last in the city. The young principal who took office in 2019 reinvigorated the school through reforms, allowing the struggling school to achieve a &quot;turnaround&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also rural parents who are working hard to create better educational conditions for their children. When policies fail to respond to demands, they seek change through &quot;self-help&quot;. Some people give up their jobs and their original lives and rent a house in the city to accompany them to school. Some people spend huge sums of money to send their children to private schools. They have one thing in common: they try their best to create a better educational environment for their children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although there are many development problems in county and township education, although educational resources in counties and townships are more scarce and the situations they face are more complex than in cities, the hope for improvement cannot be dashed. The future development of county education will not only require policy inclinations to make up for the shortcomings of county education development, but also need to activate the existing resources and comparative advantages of county and township schools through system construction to cultivate children&#39;s ability to make future choices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on these surveys, we wrote the book &quot;Children of Counties and Townships&quot;, which presents the operation of schools, teachers&#39; ideas, parents&#39; demands, students&#39; mentality, policy implementation and other education issues in the form of cases. The frontline situation explores the current situation, problems and future of county education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/22/8657Um1M0wHguVSf7A2iwK6P86HDjbF2avLOQiML.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height= &quot;1269&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/22/8657Um1M0wHguVSf7A2iwK6P86HDjbF2avLOQiML.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254819&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Children of Counties and Townships&quot; Yang Hualei and Wanghong are waiting for China Renmin University Press, September 2023&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;In response to the problem, we proposed an education development model for county middle schools, township schools, and village primary schools, believing that the county education system composed of the three is both fair and efficient. Oppose over-investment in small schools and cross-regional enrollment in super middle schools - believing that it is these that create educational competition pressure and national education anxiety. Therefore, we still believe that the hopes of most children in counties and townships will ultimately be carried by the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;作者系中南大学公共管理学院讲师&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 22 Oct 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
