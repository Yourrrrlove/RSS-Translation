Waiting to be transferred from Chechnya to &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(possibly the United Arab Emirates)&lt;/span>; for treatment.&quot; Yusof also told the media, &quot;He &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Kadyrov)&lt;/span>; has been ill for a long time and has systemic health problems. His condition has been very poor in recent days. Serious.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Kadyrov is smiling broadly in the video, it can be clearly seen that his facial contour and figure have changed significantly, and he seems to be far fatter than before. Some outsiders have speculated This is the swelling caused by his long-term kidney disease. In short, despite his own personal experience, there is still a lot of speculation and controversy about his health issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kadyrov&#39;s health condition aroused doubts from the outside world in early 2023 - Kadyrov, who claims to be infinitely loyal to Putin and will hardly miss any major events of the Moscow authorities, suddenly disappeared without any notice. Putin was absent from Putin&#39;s annual State of the Union address. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Father&#39;s legacy&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Ramzan Kadyrov, the current president of the Chechen Republic, likes to call himself &quot;Putin&#39;s little soldier&quot; and is Putin&#39;s most loyal ally. People call him Putin&#39;s fighting dog. In addition to the administrative regions, the Russian Federation also has 24 autonomous republics &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (including the internationally unrecognized territory of Ukraine)&lt;/span>;, Kaiti It is the most special one among the 24 heads of autonomous republics at the same level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What makes him special is not just his relationship with President Putin, but also that he is a social media influencer. Kadyrov said that while he admired Putin, he also tried to create the same tough guy image as Putin. Therefore, he posted videos and photos of himself firing machine guns and taming tigers on social media, as well as his high-end and luxurious daily life. Kadyrov is not only eye-catching, he is also a person who cannot be criticized casually in the Russian Federation - the leaders of the other 23 autonomous republics obviously do not have this treatment. Any Russian media or individual criticizes him in public, even if he is not there In Chechnya, people will also be asked to be cautious in their words and deeds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This unique status comes from his father Akhmad Kadyrov &lt;/span>;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ahmed Kadyrov, the former President of the Republic of Chechnya, his presidential term ended in seven months - he was killed by a bomb in an assassination attempt in May 2004 at the age of 52 years old. Ahmed was the central figure in the Kadyrov family&#39;s rise to become the rulers of the Chechen Republic, and his life was full of ups and downs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ahmed was born into a poor family in Karaganda, Kazakhstan in 1951. At that time, all the Chechens were transferred from Chechnya to Central Asia by the Soviet government to break up their resistance. They are the descendants of this group of immigrants. Later, with the change of the Soviet policy towards Chechnya, the Chechens were able to return to their hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ahmed worked in agriculture and construction during the Soviet era. In the 1980s, he entered the Islamic University of Uzbekistan to study religious studies, and then established the first modern Islamic religious schools in Chechnya, and later more He went to Oman and Jordan for further studies and became a famous religious scholar in Chechnya. In 1993, Dudayev, the leader of the Chechen separatists, declared the independence of Chechnya. Ahmed was a religious leader whom Dudayev relied heavily on. At that time, he also issued a famous declaration of jihad against Russia:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;There are 1 million Chechens and 150 million Russians. If each Chechen kills 150 Russians, we will win.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then the Chechen war broke out, and Ahmed not only called for war against Russia He launched a jihad and personally led a guerrilla force during the war. His youngest son, the current Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov, also joined the guerrillas. He later claimed that he had successfully killed someone at the age of 19. One Russian soldier died. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Russian army in the First Chechen War ended in failure and suffered heavy casualties, and was forced to make a humiliating retreat. After the war, Ahmed Kadyrov, who had become the chief mufti of Chechnya One of the main representatives of the negotiations with Russia, his guerrillas were also known as the Kadyrov faction due to their outstanding military exploits during the war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is strange, however, is that Ahmed broke with the Chechen independence faction in 1999. In the same year, Putin became the president of Russia, and the second Chechen War broke out. Ahmed this time withdrew his last declaration of jihad and led his troops in an alliance with the Russian government to fight the Chechen separatists he had fought alongside. With his help, the Russian army won the second Chechen War, which became Putin&#39;s first military victory after coming to power. This success avenged its shame, and the popularity of the Putin government was unprecedentedly high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for why Ahmed defected to help Russia in the second Chechen War, the outside world generally believes that in addition to personal ambitions and desires, he also had to do with the rise of Wahhabi fundamentalists in Chechnya. Worry. As the supreme religious leader of Chechnya, he is quite resistant to the international jihad claimed by the Wahhabis. From an ideological perspective, he is still a Chechen nationalist. After experiencing the first Chechen war, Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, was not only reduced to ruins, but also suffered a large number of casualties among the local population, causing serious social problems and economic crisis. At this time, the fundamentalists among the Chechen independence faction chose to ally with bin Laden and his like during the rise of global terrorism in an attempt to expand their territory in Russia. This is obviously not something that the Chechen nation with a population of 1.5 million can accomplish. matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on national sentiments and personal safety considerations, Ahmed publicly accused extremists of using Chechnya as a base for terrorist attacks in early 1999, which was dangerous and full of conspiracies. This led him and previous The relationship between comrades quickly deteriorated to the point of tension. At this time, the Russian government extended an olive branch to him, and forming an alliance became a matter of course. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reciprocating the favor, after the second Chechen War, Putin gave Ahmed the throne of Chechen president until his death in an assassination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is difficult to determine whether it was Ahmed&#39;s defection to Moscow that prompted Putin to make up his mind to launch a second Chechen war, or whether Putin wanted to establish his prestige through a war after coming to power, or whether the two complemented each other. result. But looking at Ahmed&#39;s choice now, whether it is based on his personal interests or the interests of the Chechen nation, it is not a mistake. Even if he did not defect and the second Chechen War did not break out at the end of 1999, after the &quot;9·11&quot; incident in 2001, it would be difficult for Chechnya to survive independently under the banner of joint anti-terrorism between the United States and Russia. It may even cause a more serious humanitarian disaster. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Prince&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As Putin’s biggest contributor in the Second Chechen War, Ahmed Kadyrov’s political legacy was successfully passed on to his younger son Ramzan Kadyrov. Derov succeeded, and the latter soon became the real &quot;king&quot; of Chechnya. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there is a process for getting to the top. In November 2005, a year and a half after Ahmed was assassinated, the then Prime Minister of Chechnya Sergey Abramov was seriously injured in a car accident and resigned due to health reasons. The cause of his car accident has not yet been determined, and the possibility of assassination cannot be completely ruled out, because at that time, assassinations of Chechen military and political leaders were common, and Sergei was assassinated in 2004, so the truth may never be confirmed. In any case, the biggest beneficiary of this car accident was the then First Deputy Prime Minister Ramzan Kadyrov. He became acting Prime Minister of Chechnya on November 18, 2005. A year later, he was officially promoted from &quot;Prince&quot; as &quot;King&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/ZvIZ8puCKbgy4aB6jOT5UdVh8YhdujEScHCwozQc.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;746&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/ZvIZ8puCKbgy4aB6jOT5UdVh8YhdujEScHCwozQc.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252398&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On January 30, 2004, President of the Chechen Republic Akhmed Kadyrov (right) and his son Ramzan Kadyrov&lt;span style=&quot;color : #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ramzan Kadyrov’s first task after taking power was to rebuild Grozny, the capital of Chechnya. He built the Akhmed Kadyrov Mosque in the center of Chechnya in the name of his father, also known as the Heart of Chechnya. It is the largest mosque in Russia and one of the largest in Europe; it has the most It can accommodate 10,000 people, has a magnificent dome, a towering minaret and hand-painted by Turkish craftsmen. These are the standards for large mosques built during the heyday of the Ottoman Empire. On October 16, 2008, the mosque was officially opened. Ramzan Kadyrov and Putin both attended the opening ceremony and appeared side by side in the news. In addition to the magnificent mosque, the palace-like presidential palace, highways, five-star hotels and casinos have risen from the ground. Now Grozny has become a modern city with many high-rise buildings. Its core business district is even compared with Moscow and St. Petersburg. No less impressive. Funding for these large-scale infrastructure projects comes from the support of the Russian Federation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to reward the loyalty of the Kadyrov family, under the personal care of President Putin, the Russian Federation invested US$18 billion in the Chechen Republic in 2010 alone, with an average per capita income of more than US$1,300. In contrast, the autonomous republic of Dagestan next door to Chechnya spent less than $1.6 billion in federal investment in 2010, but the country has a population of 2.2 million. Relying on financial support from Moscow, Ramzan was able to complete the reconstruction of Grozny as one of the core achievements of his internal rule. However, the heavy economic dependence on Russia has also led to a rather deformed economic structure in Chechnya. The local area lacks core industrial chains and the unemployment rate remains high. In 2010, it even reached an astonishing over 60%. It is obviously impossible to solve the problem by relying entirely on federal funds and large-scale construction projects. The core local issue is the economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/alxQC5TrmUCcwFQIdOagoa4PBKvPULr8v5AI7jxx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/alxQC5TrmUCcwFQIdOagoa4PBKvPULr8v5AI7jxx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252397&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On February 25, 2022, the Chechen armed forces held a swearing-in meeting to prepare for their mission in Ukraine. Chechen leader Kadyrov (middle) takes a group photo with soldiers &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What we must note is that La Mzan&#39;s greatest economic achievement in Chechnya is not that he built Grozny into another St. Petersburg through extensive construction, but that he successfully obtained economic autonomy from Moscow. In 2018, Ramzan Kadyrov announced that his government would take over 100% of the shares of Chechen State Petroleum Technology Company, allowing Chechens to develop, extract and sell crude oil on their own. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, 1,100 oil wells and 2,000 land parcels owned by the Chechen State Petroleum Technology Company with a total area of ​​7,740 hectares were all controlled by the Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft. Ramzan has been fighting for control of oil assets in Chechnya since at least 2015, the year he first proposed to Putin that the Chechen Oil Company be handed over to Chechnya. On the surface, Putin agreed to transfer the equity, but in fact he has been putting it on hold. The reason why Moscow adopts the procrastination strategy is not entirely due to economic considerations, but one of the main means of control over Chechnya for a long time is economic control. During the Soviet era, Moscow firmly controlled the extraction, transportation and sales of local oil. Local people could only engage in agriculture and handicrafts, and were almost unable to enter the oil industry. The result of this was that the local area had to rely on financial subsidies from the Soviet Union&#39;s central government, otherwise infrastructure and public spending would be almost impossible to carry out. During the first Chechen war, Chechen guerrillas obtained military expenses by stealing crude oil from Russian oil pipelines passing through Chechnya. The elites in Moscow certainly know the importance of controlling the oil industry in controlling Chechnya. Therefore, they are not only unwilling to hand over control, but also deliberately do not expand local oil production capacity. However, Ramzan successfully overcame the calculations of the oil oligarchs and economic elites by relying on his personal relationship with Putin. With Putin&#39;s personal intervention, Ramzan got what he wanted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As seen in the fight for control of oil, Ramzan Kadyrov clearly knows what he needs and how to get it from Moscow. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Kadyrov&#39;s Chechnya&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Chechen high school students are now required to read Akhmed Kadyrov&#39;s biography &quot;The Road Bathed in Light&quot;, according to Chechen state television &quot;, as &quot;supplementary material for the study of Russian history&quot;, the book introduces &quot;the political and spiritual legacy of Akhmad Kadyrov&quot;. Schools are required to organize regular essay and poster competitions featuring Kadyrov and his family. Teachers and school administrators are required to comment on social media posts by Kadyrov and his inner circle as part of their job evaluation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the magnificent Kadyrov Mosque, there are more than 300 streets in the Chechen Republic named after Akhmed Kadyrov. In 2020, Ramzan Kadyrov ordered that images of American comic book superheroes be removed from Chechen children&#39;s centers and playgrounds and replaced with likenesses of his father and other &quot;real heroes&quot; in the region. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ramzan hopes that his father will become the only superhero in Chechnya, and he will become the first Internet celebrity in Chechnya. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Kadyrov family on the Internet shines brightly, and at the same time they are down-to-earth and full of true nature. Instagram has been Ramzan’s favorite platform for years, where he actively shares his outfits and lifestyle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ramzan also opened a Telegram channel to share his carefully recorded videos and his views on the current situation. He even gained millions of followers by feuding with Elon Musk on Twitter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Run by his PR team, his father, Ahmed Kadyrov, became a loving father and hero who saved Chechnya and became a great martyr, revolutionary and Martyr Saint. Ramzan himself is a kind-hearted Chechen brother. Not only does he have an enviable luxurious and cool life, he is also a fan of President Putin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an interview with Vesti-24 TV station in 2018, Ramzan Kadyrov stated that he was rebuilding Putin&#39;s Caucasus native cavalry division, or &quot;Barbarian Division&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a very famous allusion to Tsarist Russia. The Caucasus Cavalry Division was affiliated to the Russian Imperial Army. It was established on August 23, 1914. It participated in World War I and was led by Russian Grand Duke Michael Alexander. Rovich conducts. The division earned the nickname &quot;The Barbarians&quot; for its lax discipline, but the unit was a fighting force, distinguished itself during World War I and was loyal to the Tsar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ramzan&#39;s concept of &quot;barbarian divisions&quot; actually has a deeper meaning. Since Putin intends to incorporate Tsarist Russia into the orthodox national historical narrative, Ramzan&#39;s repeated mention of &quot;barbarian divisions&quot; is precisely to borrow from ancient times. Yu Jin showed his loyalty to Putin. In fact, Ramzan has been working hard to maintain an image of himself and the Chechen nation as brave and loyal. The security forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs controlled by Ramzan not only collaborated with the Russian army in South Ossetia&#39;s war against Georgia in 2008, but also actively participated in the Syrian war. Chechen special forces have frequently participated in various international special forces competitions, and have won the Jordan King&#39;s Cup special competitions many times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/lzvpOxPRgyNW9F2JGK2lIcNC5q2C7Zx2VReO5K60.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/lzvpOxPRgyNW9F2JGK2lIcNC5q2C7Zx2VReO5K60.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252395&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On March 13, 2023, in Moscow, Russian President Putin (left) met with Chechen leader Kadyrov&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China /Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to participating in Russia-related military operations, the international community also accused Ramzan of participating in the assassination or intimidation of Russian anti-government figures, but there is not enough evidence to prove this. Prove this. Since the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Chechnya has sent tens of thousands of troops to directly participate. Although there is no evidence to prove that they played a key role in the war, and they are not even as good as the Wagner mercenary group that successfully captured a city, their posture is undoubtedly very important. in place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What further illustrates Ramzan’s attitude is that when Prigozhin led Wagner to march into Moscow in June 2023, local troops along the way were unable to intercept him. Only Ramzan Kadyrov’s men were the last to stop him. The elite &quot;Akhmat&quot; special forces positioned themselves on a bridge near the town of Kolomna, about 110 kilometers from Moscow, preparing to intercept the Wagner rebels, saying they were ready to fight to defend Vladimir Putin. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Loyal enough, and Ramzan clearly does not look like a threat to Putin&#39;s regime. Not only because of the small number of ethnic Chechens, but more importantly, within Moscow’s power circle, Kadyrov’s only political backer is Putin. If Putin loses his support, there is no guarantee that the next Chechen president’s surname will still be Kadyrov. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it seems that the probability that the future leader of Chechnya will be named Kadyrov is still very high, not to mention that members of the Kadyrov family almost control all important positions in the Chechen government. Like his son Akhmat Kadyrov who is less than 18 years old &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 混体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Akhmat Kadyrov)&lt;/span>; was also attacked in March 2023 received an interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to relevant reports, this was an informal meeting. Akhmat, who has served as the chairman of the board of directors of Chechnya’s Children and Youth Organization, introduced to Putin the youth policies and activities of Chechnya. status quo. Putin congratulated Akhmat on his upcoming marriage and shared with Akhmat his memories of his relationship with his grandfather, Akhmat Kadyrov. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No one knows what they said, but they may have talked about Putin meeting a weeping Ramzan in the Kremlin after Ahmed was assassinated in 2004. News reports at the time said it was also an informal meeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 01 Oct 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[外星人遗体被发现？全世界有几百万人每天都寻找外星人]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258006]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-01 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;audio id=&quot;contents-audio-0&quot; data-fileid=&quot;5576678021854137506&quot; data-media=&quot; audio&quot; data-resource=&quot;tencent&quot; data-filename=&quot;Podcast · Some Culture Alien remains have been found?

However, netizens in Shandong have posted When the tall man next to him came out, Heilongjiang netizens were not idle either. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data show that in the national height competition between boys and girls, the height of boys in Heilongjiang ranks first, while the height of girls ranks first in Shandong Province. With the development of economy and life As the level increases, the average heights of men and women are 174 cm and 161.4 cm respectively. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Height has always been a topic of public concern. What kind of height is best in the eyes of the opposite sex? According to Polish scientist Pokryka, the standard for a perfect woman is an average height of 1.74 meters, and the standard for a perfect man is an average height of no less than 1.82 meters, with leg length equal to the length of the upper body, and a ratio of 1:1 that makes a man Looks stronger. However, the so-called perfect body standard cannot be generalized. In the era of aesthetic diversity, health has a standard definition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what factors determine height? First of all, 70% of a person&#39;s final height depends on genetic factors, but in addition to genes, nutrition, exercise, environment, living habits, etc. all have a great impact on height. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, this is only an ideal standard. In reality, there are still relatively few situations that can achieve this state. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the current aesthetic trend of society pursuing height, many people will have height anxiety and try unconventional remedies to increase their height through injections, medicines, and surgeries. However, these methods have certain risks. . &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, &quot;Know&quot; kindly reminds you how we should treat the height issue rationally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/16cf2dcb0158e649e618c3473a1cca4b.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;853&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/16cf2dcb0158e649e618c3473a1cca4b.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252072&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/cac7600c61568750cf1f386f29749055.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width =&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1439&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/cac7600c61568750cf1f386f29749055.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252073&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/6845665a65be5d8656acc2e82b9870f3.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1439&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/6845665a65be5d8656acc2e82b9870f3.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252074&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/7499d3bd6e19e9fe5d1ed72624f40192.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1439&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/7499d3bd6e19e9fe5d1ed72624f40192.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252075&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/49969dc59efdd5d5c0defbdff8c53615.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1439&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/49969dc59efdd5d5c0defbdff8c53615.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252076&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src =&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/2522bcfd6ff43f2145542646209f877b.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1439 &quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/2522bcfd6ff43f2145542646209f877b.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252077&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot; https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/c6f26de596a834b79b4e9c493189113a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1439&quot; data -src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/c6f26de596a834b79b4e9c493189113a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252078&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>; &lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a >; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 01 Oct 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“身心灵导师”学霸猫从者如云：哪类人最容易被收割？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258010]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-01 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, &quot;New Weekly&quot; reported on the &quot;body, mind and soul mentor&quot; Xueba Mao, triggering an investigation into the so-called &quot; Controversies and discussions about &quot;Zero Limit Cleansing Method&quot; and spiritual practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xuebamao taught his followers, such as &quot;People don&#39;t have to work hard, everything will go naturally and smoothly&quot;, &quot;Whatever you do should be easy, don&#39;t endure hardship, don&#39;t get entangled, follow your own preferences&quot;, smell Is it a little bit Lao-Zhuang and Buddhist? According to reports, the theory of &quot;Zero Limit Cleansing Method&quot; comes from &quot;At Zero&quot; written by American Xiu Lan in 2007. It is translated as &quot;Zero Limit: Hawaiian Therapy for Creating Health, Calm and Wealth&quot;, and the mantra is &quot;Sorry, Please forgive me, thank you, I love you.” Doesn’t it sound very positive? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then, a group of young people who were inexperienced in the world joined Xueba Mao&#39;s &quot;body, mind and soul community&quot;. &quot;There are thousands of people, and more than 70% of them are women.&quot; Ordinary spiritual practices often teach people to control or let go of desires. Xuebamao does the opposite, allowing students or believers to buy without asking the price or looking at the labels. Debt does not matter. Xuebamao believes that in order to “clear away the fear of money, one must choose a method of flowing large amounts of money to open up one’s own energy.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people believe in it and use their savings to buy or borrow money to buy what they like, and buy various courses and consultations from Xuebamao. &quot;With the expansion of the community one after another, there has been a trend of debt consumption among students. Living in a large flat, driving a luxury car, going to Xinrongji for afternoon tea, and constantly opening credit cards...Xueba Mao Dai With one bracelet, everyone will go to the same store to buy the bracelet. Not only that, everyone&#39;s speaking style is becoming more and more similar.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Who is Xueba Mao? In 2015, Mao Mao, a top student who graduated from the sociology department of a certain university, tried to start a business; around 2017, she found &quot;body, mind and soul practice&quot;. In 2021, the price of courses began to increase, and Xuebamao changed its original simple style, and the community was renamed &quot;Xuebamao·Hogwarts Lady Branch&quot;. A student discovered that her course had experienced several rounds of price increases, from 199 yuan to 999 yuan in the first quarter, and the price increased to 9999 yuan in the third and fourth quarters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This true story makes people feel a lot of emotions when reading it: First, the students believe in Xueba Mao’s spiritual practice theory and spend their own money to buy and buy in order to gain spiritual freedom. Xueba Mao Whose money does it cost me to buy flowers? In this real-person game, who is the real financial freedom and spiritual freedom? Secondly, spiritual cultivation is really a good business. As long as the seller makes people believe in his theory and himself, he can make the buyer &quot;use his body and his arms, and his arms and his fingers.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, there is supply only when there is demand. The various spiritual schools on the market actually reflect the spiritual crisis, spiritual crisis and value crisis faced by some people in the modern social environment. To put it simply, it is because it is too short to enter modern society, and many people have suffered from many mental discomforts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not to say that traditional societies do not have such crises, but that comparatively speaking, such crises are much less common in traditional societies. This is because traditional societies are basically in a state of scarcity, and people are busy working all day long to provide &quot;three meals a day&quot; for the whole family. In fact, &quot;three meals a day&quot; is just rhetoric here. Only in an era of abundant food can everyone live a healthy life. &quot;Three meals a day&quot; day. In this case, most people are mainly concerned about survival and have no leisure to pay attention to the so-called spiritual life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In modern society, everyone leaves the countryside where they are familiar and in their comfort zone and enters the city full of strangers. On the one hand, the income is much higher than that of their ancestors, and it is not a problem to have enough or even good food. Son, in addition to higher income, there is also more leisure. In fact, people cannot really let themselves be leisurely, so they will inevitably have spiritual thinking and pursuit. But on the other hand, natural blood communities such as families tend to disintegrate. Everyone in the city is atomized and scattered. We come into contact with many people every day at work, but how many people can we have close relationships with? Humans are social animals, which brings a lot of loneliness and insecurity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to get rid of it, some people will look for like-minded people online and offline. People with similar knowledge background or values ​​will come together, as well as common interests and hobbies such as fishing or playing games together. In short, we must &quot;talk with the same voice&quot; &quot;Response, seek each other with the same spirit&quot; to settle their own souls; some people throw themselves into the embrace of spiritual practice and the like. There are all kinds of methods, all of which are used by people to relieve or solve their spiritual atomism, loneliness and insecurity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From Chaoyang District Rinpoche to &quot;Master Wang Lin&quot; to various &quot;body, mind and spiritual teachers&quot;, the routines and profit models of these people are similar: I know that you are facing a spiritual crisis, a spiritual crisis and a crisis of values. , come on, lost lambs, children of lost souls, come to my arms and hand over your body and mind to me. I have the final and definite answer here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even the so-called &quot;body-body-spiritual guru&quot; also went through a process of spiritual struggle and internal consumption to enlightenment. &quot;Human, too human&quot;. His personal experience increases the credibility of the narrative and the &quot;truth&quot; he preaches. Credibility.在某个阶段，会皆大欢喜，学员得到了虚幻的心灵自由，导师则得到了真实的财务自由。但最终，你可能无法生活在自欺与谎言中。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们每一个人都得明白：只能在做有意义的工作中、过有意义的生活中，发现意义本身，建立自己强大的价值观内核，质朴刚健，有勇气去开拓、去面对、去战斗，为自己、为家人。这一切都得靠自己与真心爱自己的家人，买不来，买来的必是赝品与麻醉品。须知，精神上的软弱是最大的软弱。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;这部影片也是编剧陈宇与张艺谋合作的开始。剧本是陈宇写的，原本想自己拍，但写出来之后，他发现自己驾驭不了这么复杂的题材，于是他找到张艺谋，希望由他来拍。看完剧本，张艺谋非常喜欢，立刻把其他项目往后推，集中精力拍了《坚如磐石》。拍完《坚如磐石》，张艺谋又与陈宇合作了《满江红》和《狙击手》，最先面世的，是《狙击手》。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因为接连与张艺谋合作三部大片，陈宇得以被大众看见。编剧之外，陈宇是北京大学艺术学院教授。 &lt;/p>;

data-key=&quot;252347&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;陈宇2023年9月下旬在北京接受南方周末采访。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（卢佳/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陈宇大学本科是学历史的，报考了北京电影学院导演系研究生，每天8点钟起来就去拉片室拉片子、上课，“扎扎实实的三年”。硕士毕业，陈宇又报考了中央戏剧学院，师从知名戏剧导演曹其敬，攻读戏剧原理、戏剧美学方向博士，是典型的学院派。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;研究生期间，陈宇与几个同学一起，和中央电视台电影频道有过一些对电影先锋性的探索。当时电影频道在探讨一种可能性，就是做一些能在电视上放的电影，这种样态在西方早已有之，“film&amp;nbsp;made for TV”，就是所谓的“电视电影”，但在中国，电视电影还没有出现过。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在这样的背景下，陈宇担任编剧，创作了一部奇幻片《8点35分》，这部影片成为当时中央电视台电影频道最受欢迎的数字电影之一，还因此获得了百合奖优秀影片。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陈宇也是互联网影视最早的一批从业者。 2009年，他拍了中国第一部商业微电影，《Always Online：爱·在线》。在这部为日本电通广告、中国联想集团创作的微电影中，陈宇既是导演，也是编剧，他用讲故事的方式把产品理念融入其中。这部微电影被认为是2008年互联网点击收视率最高的中国网络电影，还获得过国际一线广告大奖——英国晶英奖年度最佳网络电影奖。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有很长一段时间，陈宇游离于电影工业之外，他一头扎进各种电影、戏剧理论学说中，用他自己的话说，“为了创造自己的方法论，要把电影和戏剧这两个东西结合到一起”，他花了十年左右“面壁式思考”，终于建立起一套系统的方法论，之后，他觉得可以去创作了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《坚如磐石》是一部结合了警匪片+犯罪片的类型片。有一段时间，陈宇对反腐的案例比较感兴趣，看到新闻里某官员履职，附有其履历；之后又看到其落马的消息。陈宇脑子里会想象这个人的生命历程：他应该是在哪一段出了问题？可能是些什么样的问题，最后才导致他命运的这样一种结局？ “我觉得他们背后折射出的人性的某些特质，很有思考和嚼头。”从这个角度再去想，陈宇写成了《坚如磐石》。 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/TB5fUcxCl2n1HoSurtzMVrzmIU08T6zkWWt9UaAz.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;723&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/TB5fUcxCl2n1HoSurtzMVrzmIU08T6zkWWt9UaAz.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252346&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;陈宇创作《坚如磐石》剧本源自对反腐案例的关注。图为该片剧照。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（资料图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“归纳来讲，《坚如磐石》讲的就是人的异化。人在特定的环境中、特定的时期、特定的位置，在漫长的时间里他是会异化的。这是一种古希腊意义的悲剧，就是人眼看着不可避免地走向崩溃，事态不可避免地走向毁灭。”陈宇说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“认知观众在观看电影时的心理活动”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;《满江红》《狙击手》有明显的类型片的特点，那么《坚如磐石》呢？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;陈宇：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;《坚如磐石》也是类型片，它不是单一类型，我自己一直在从事类型片的研究以及创作。如果要做类型片，它不一定非得是一种类型，比如像《坚如磐石》，我是把两种类型进行融合，一种是警匪类型，就是一个正义的使者比如警察、侦探去探寻一个事情的真相，它背后的主题价值是正义战胜邪恶；还有一种类型是犯罪类型，它实际上讲的是一个罪案或者一场犯罪是如何产生的。 《坚如磐石》我试图把这两种类型进行一个融合。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于类型片的理解和研究，对我来讲价值就是，能很精准地去认知观众在观看一个电影时的心理活动过程，包括看完以后是否能获得足够的情感和心理满足。所以一旦我们采用类型片理论来作为创作的基石和方法的时候，实际上就默认了几件事：第一，最重要的价值和意义是从故事角度获得的；第二，你认同和观众“共谋”。比如说我们拍一个恐怖片，我们事先约定一些前提——我这个片子是一个恐怖片，它中间可能从生活原理来讲不一定那么合理，但是你同不同意我给你的这个假定性？如果你接受这个假定性，我一定会给你恐怖片所获得的这种心理满足。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;在一个没有秩序的地方或者在一个半秩序的地方发生，它就是另外一种类型片，比如在半秩序的地方就是西部片。西部片就是在一个有一点点秩序，比如美国人修铁路修到西部，然后有一个小镇，镇上有一个警长，这个警长的力量不够强，经常会被邪恶势力、犯罪势力所碾压，在这种半法治的地方所产生的冲突和故事。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;对于创作者来说，还会面对的一个问题是，处理情节的跌宕和兼顾人物，对你来说哪个是第一位的？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;陈宇：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我会把这个问题换成结构和人物对我很重要。我觉得情节实际上是结构的一种展开方式。当然作为观众，我们在第一层看见的是情节，但实际上情节的背后是结构决定的，所以说结构和人物就是我们创作中非常重要的出发点。亚里士多德做过一个辨析，就是结构和人物哪个更重要？亚里士多德自己认为他会从结构出发。我是亚里士多德的信徒，我感觉他说的是我比较认同的，就是我会更多从结构出发，但是最终会和人物殊途同归。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你经常提及“硬核叙事”，比如你说韩国的电影是三大元素的组合——成熟的类型、导演强烈的风格和社会议题。 《坚如磐石》里有这三大元素吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;陈宇：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我努力在做。 《坚如磐石》是标准的类型样态，在讲故事的方式上，在影像上、在叙事上它是有自己的特征，甚至具有某种作者性。作者性实际上和类型并不矛盾，比如像克里斯托弗·诺兰就是一个非常优秀的好莱坞导演，他也做大片，也做类型片，但他仍然有很强烈的作者风格。不仅是在《奥本海默》《敦刻尔克》这样形式感很强的电影，乃至在《星际穿越》这样一个标准的好莱坞大片里也是这样。你会感觉它跟漫威的大片是完全不一样的，它有明确的讲故事的方法以及人物的处理。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你谈过中国的学院派导演，实际上这不是制造出来的一个概念，是一个真实存在的现象。在你看来，现在有哪些值得被关注的学院派导演？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;陈宇：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;学院派导演我在论文里会讲到一些界定，但其实我们可以把这个概念稍微放宽一点，不一定非得是他在大学里面工作，因为这部分人其实并没有那么多，比如像曹保平导演、谢飞导演这样优秀的导演。如果更宽泛一点说，学院派导演是那种在电影理论上具有较强自觉性的，最突出的标志，就是他做一部片子会把这部片子放在电影史、电影的流派、电影的风格上有一个清晰的位置，他脑海里有一个巨大的树状图，从历史、国别、风格、样态的角度，他有整个图谱，脑海里有这种自觉性，我觉得就可以被称为学院派导演，某种程度上也可以和学者型导演画等号。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他和另外一个概念，也就是片场型导演是对应的。片场型导演就是我不用管那些，生长于片场里，甚至好多人都没有上过专业的电影院校，就是跟着师父一步步走出来的，在以前的电影工业里面都是这样，包括像希区柯克这样的导演，也是原来在制片厂里画背景板、做美术工作的，包括小津安二郎。我觉得这两拨人的创作方式、工作方式乃至观念是有所不同的，都可能产生优秀的作者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你比较喜欢和欣赏的导演是哪些呢？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;陈宇：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我在上电影学院的时候最迷的是马丁·斯科塞斯。那时候我比较痴迷于视听语言和电影的形式，马丁·斯科塞斯早期作品的形式是极其天马行空的，而且极其具有自己的风格特点，所以我当时的毕业论文就是马丁·斯科塞斯电影研究；之后很长一段时间我比较迷的是希区柯克，他是一个讲故事的超级高手；最近这些年，我崇拜的是奥逊·威尔斯，他的《公民凯恩》，在1940年代就能把叙事、思想的深刻性、对人类社会生活的理解，包括政治、私人生活等等这么多东西完美地放在一个电影之中。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“我的职责是说出你舒适区以外的东西”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;《坚如磐石》是你与张艺谋导演合作的开始。从《坚如磐石》结束到《满江红》，中间有多大的跨度呢？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;陈宇：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;很快。顺序是先做的《坚如磐石》，那时候也是我和艺谋导演认识，然后一起合作。之后导演说陈宇不错，咱们接着弄，就提出了《满江红》这样一个动议。 《满江红》写到故事大纲出来，临时插进来了《狙击手》，我们就先把《狙击手》整个弄完、拍完上映，又回头把《满江红》的故事大纲去扩张。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总体来说，可能在合作中大家互相比较熟悉，对对方的能力和特质都比较认同，所以他天天说，“我们有好剧本，你也得赶紧，得努力。”实际上我一直在试图跟上他的脚步，但现在不是我一个人跟不上，他的节奏太快。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/oBeBMIn0wqFzyvd86WW2NgF8d4FE249Z4GtHmKpG.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;电影《坚如磐石》是张艺谋执导的首部警匪犯罪片。图为该片剧照。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（资料图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;张艺谋导演这样的节奏，在中国电影界还没有人能够超过他？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;陈宇：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;对，他是我见过的在工作上最勤奋的人，不只是电影界。关键是，不是说他拿强大的意志来逼自己去勤奋工作，而是他就喜欢这件事，干这个事对他来讲是快乐的，也是舒服的，也是休息，也是工作。有时候我说我们去哪儿度个假去，咱们国内国外看看，他说“在那我就不高兴，对我来讲就不是度假”。你基本上让他不干事待几天是不太可能的，因此他的（整体）节奏就会很快。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你和张艺谋导演的叙事美学或者对电影的理解肯定是有所差异的，会因此发生争执吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;陈宇：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;首先对于我和他的合作来讲，我是一个学习者的心态。我们是看着他的电影来学习电影的，他以前的那些成就我们从心底里是真的认，所以在这种状态下，我是从他那儿偷师。 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，有些戏的处理我们会有不同的看法，这时候他也提我也提，大家来回拉风箱，但是一般到最后时间差不多了，我会把关于这个问题我为什么这样，整个写一篇东西罗列几种可能，好处、问题都在哪，一起给导演，最后由导演来决定。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我跟他说，我的职责是给你提出更多内容的可能性，要说出在你舒适区以外的东西。他有非常庞大的一个舒适区，比一般人的要大得多，他搞各种事都搞得很顺手。但我的职责是什么？我说我必须要给你提不一样的，也许我提的这东西并不一定是我认为最好的选择，也可能你自己的决定是最好的选择，但是我必须把这个可能性罗列出来，最后你来做选择，这是导演的职责。我也相信他一定会做出最恰当的选择。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;一部电影当演员选定后，你们会围绕演员再对剧本做一些修改吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;陈宇：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;会，对这种主流电影或者大的工业级的电影，我们这项工作基本上都是会做的，包括《满江红》也是。张艺谋导演说，“没演之前人随戏，演的时候戏随人”，我觉得他说得特别好。我自己原来做导演，做一些小片子，我是尽量把演员的状态在我脑海里想得特别精准，甚至数三秒你再让他说这句话，那演员就特别不知所措。现在想起来自己是有问题的，表演是一个有机体，不能把人变成一个机器人，他应该有自己的思想，有自己的连贯性，有自己的节奏和节拍，这一点上我在艺谋导演身上学到特别多，如何把一个戏给呈现出来，他有很多招。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;那你们会在现场更改台词吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;陈宇：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;如果这个剧本到开拍了还在大改，那也是不会开拍的，所以基本上开拍就是定稿了。更多的调整是一些表演的状态，或者节奏，或者是说这个话的语气的变化。有时候会有一些小的台词上的调整，大体上不会怎么变，这也是艺谋导演工作的一种科学性，这一点我们两个相似，不相信现场的或者临时的灵感，他甚至会有意拒绝这样的灵感。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比如说还有一个礼拜开拍了，我突然对这场戏有特别好的想法，我说这场戏要这样会产生很大的改观，作为一个创作者都会很激动的，但是艺谋导演非常冷静，就说你这个想法是好想法，三个月前要是提出来就立刻开始调，但是现在还有一个礼拜开拍了，它的消化时间不够，为此我宁可保持现在这个东西。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是我学到的一课，对我影响很大。我觉得这来自一个长期的经验。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;《满江红》《狙击手》《坚如磐石》之后，“陈张系列”还会有下一部吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;陈宇：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;正在做，正在策划和写作中。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;这种组合会成为你创作的唯一选项吗？有陈宇自己的电影吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;陈宇：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我认为会有。当然和艺谋的合作我也特别希望、特别愿意继续往下进行，我会努力跟着他的脚步。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“写剧本是不要文笔的”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;以前的电影很多是踩在文学的肩膀上改编的，但是现在，你自己做的电影，包括你和张艺谋导演合作的电影，都是原创剧本，这种习惯是自然而然形成的吗，还是一种选择？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;陈宇：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;其实我觉得电影的创作，具体到文本的创作，和文学之间有关也无关，我倾向于电影和文学是两个东西。我们可以从文学中间汲取营养，但是这个营养其实也许并不是只有文学才有，比如说对社会的理解、对人的理解、对人类情感的理解、对人物关系多种模型的认知，这些东西其实从生活中也可以来。只不过文学是有效地在做这件事，而且长期以来在做这件事，我们从中获取这些东西是最方便的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是文学这种形式本身和电影文本我认为是完全不同的两个东西，甚至在今天我招研究生，经常有学生说，我从小是文学爱好者，我的文笔很好。在我这儿，我说你的文笔好不是写剧本的优势，甚至是写剧本的劣势。因为你的文笔好，你就会拿它去遮蔽人物、情节和动作上的不足，你看起来写得花里胡哨的，那些东西对我们电影是没有用的，我还得给它摘了，看看干货是什么。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以我说写剧本是不要文笔的，不要修辞，我自己的剧本没有形容词，全部都是人、动作、台词，一个人30岁，穿了什么衣服，走过来坐下说……就是这些了，没有任何文学描写。如果有学生给我交来，比如说一个男人坐在那里吃面，体现出忧郁的情绪。那我说忧郁的情绪要删掉。忧郁的情绪是什么样？你得让我看一眼，他做什么了。忧郁这些词都是文学思维，我要的是可见的、具象化的表达。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;我们知道，电影工业里有很多模式非常成熟，这些东西会不会有一天被ChatGPT、被人工智能取代？这中间有什么东西是人工智能无法取代的？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;陈宇：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;这个问题也是最近大家都在思考的问题，人工智能出来以后是不是会取代电影的一些行当？我的感觉是会的，但是它取代的方式是从终端往回取代。也就是说越技术化程序化的东西，比如说电脑特效、换脸这种。现在都已经用AI去换脸了，电脑特效的计算这些也是逐渐会的。甚至我觉得在未来5—10年里可能会出现部分（智能）拍摄，就是我说几句话、几个关键词，这个影像它就基本上先给你生成了，然后你在这个基础上再去做调整。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是我觉得再往回倒到最早，故事的策划生产这个环节，要取代它还是挺难的。从哲学意义上，最基础的东西很难由ChatGPT来产生，它不可能创造，只是对现有信息的拼凑、组合，而我们作为一个创作者，你要干的事情最大的价值是把这个宇宙里没有过的东西拿出来，而且具有特定的意义。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你曾经批判过好莱坞的高概念电影，就是创造视听奇观的那些电影。中国市场这几年的确在经历一个极大的变化，以前中国观众很吃这一套，但现在变了，经典叙事的电影或者与本土元素结合更紧密的题材打败了那套好莱坞模式。这个“打败”是观众的口味换了呢，还是中国的创作者真正拿出了更好的东西？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;陈宇：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;本质上我认为高概念电影是现代广告业思维催生的，它以电影的某个特定要素来作为生产一部电影的理由。比如，最早做一部电影的理由是你这个故事好，看这个故事我有享受，或者这个人物有意思，这就是比较古典的心理需求。但是在高概念电影以后，大概是在1980年代左右，有大片的概念出现，那就不一样了，是广告思维。比如我拍这部电影，不是为了讲一个故事，而是为了一件衣服，我从一个时尚的角度去展示服装，这个要素高于故事、高于人物，你看了我这部电影以后，可能在故事上没有得到满足，但是在里面看到了时装、时尚。逐渐地，高概念电影变成了，我有许许多多的理由让我拍一部电影，比如特效、视听震撼，哪怕故事人物一塌糊涂，不管，特效好就行。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;广告思维，就是我自己总结这些高概念电影的本质。这个有错没错？可以，但是我比较反感的是只有这个，或者说不思进取，原创性越来越低，不断地重复。比如漫威的电影我就不是特别欣赏，包括大量的续集电影，它本质上是追求极度安全，一点险不能冒，扼杀原创性。现在主流的好莱坞电影让我非常担忧和失望，不是说今天在我们中国市场上，我们的国产片已经远远超过他们，其实一方面是国产片在进步，另一方面，是它们自身造成的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;高概念电影曾经从1980年代到21世纪很长一段时间流行，现在慢慢又变了，中国电影市场包括国际电影市场逐渐回归到对于叙事本体价值的一种认同，这是我非常高兴看到的一种变化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 01 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[月亮山：风车、云海与斑斓霞光 | 眼睛在旅游③]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257599]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-01 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 01 Oct 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[在新疆与银河“合影”丨指尖华夏②]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257581]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-30 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;在新疆维吾尔自治区哈密市，漫天繁星如同镶嵌在天空的钻石，散发着璀璨的光芒，美不胜收。游客们络绎不绝，在璀璨星空下仰望苍穹，与银河“合影”。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The situation of women is a theme that runs through almost all the film and television works of director Li Shaohong. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A mother-in-law who devotes herself wholeheartedly to her son and grandson and lives without self, a mother-in-law who works hard in life The daughter-in-law looking for herself in the cracks of the epidemic in 2020, the sudden epidemic, these &quot;natural enemies&quot; who were hit by the epidemic were isolated at home, and they had a rare closed space that only belonged to two people...&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;This is director Li Shaohong&#39;s presentation in the movie &quot;Her in the World&quot; to be released in September 2022. The original intention of the film was to tell the story of the impact of the epidemic on women at home. Li Shaohong recalled that in May 2020, the producer came to see her. At that time, everyone was still in the first wave of the epidemic, wearing masks, and did not know each other. It was difficult to find a coffee shop, but they did not dare to sit in it. We were talking in the corridor outside with the cold wind blowing - it was still cold in spring in Beijing at that time. The other two directors of the film are Chen Chong and Sylvia Chang. Li Shaohong said: &quot;Our combination has a bit of a Detachment of Women feeling. Me, Chen Chong, and Sylvia Chang, we are all women, and the producer is also a woman.&quot; In the end, the film uses three stories. , showing how ordinary people find love and hope in difficult situations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before &quot;Her in the World&quot;, in 2021, in the female monologue variety show &quot;Hear Her Say&quot;, &quot;Yun Zhongzhuan&quot; directed by Li Shaohong tells the story of a baby girl from a family of craftsmen who was forced to change her gender. , living as a boy. Because he was raised as a boy, he developed gender cognitive impairment and missed his love. She sacrificed herself and became a major contributor to the revival of her family&#39;s &quot;Guangcai culture&quot; (Guangzhou woven gold-colored porcelain, now a national intangible cultural heritage). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Shaohong recalled that the prominence of the female perspective in his works went through a process from self-repression, unconsciousness to consciousness. The first film of her directorial career, &quot;Silver Snake Murder&quot;, is a genre film with strong personality and strong style. &quot;At that time, I felt from a certain perspective that I can do what men can do. This What the genre requires is my standard.&quot; She told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The emergence of her true female consciousness began with the filming of &quot;Bloody Morning&quot; in 1990. The inspiration for the story is taken from Marquez&#39;s novel &quot;A Premeditated Murder&quot;, but in fact, Marquez&#39;s story only provided an excuse for Li Shaohong. Human issues such as marriage and women&#39;s lack of self-awareness are what she really wants to show. In 1995, when he filmed &quot;Red Pink&quot; (adapted from Su Tong&#39;s novel of the same name), Li Shaohong used the perspective of two women with fireworks in the old era to tell the story of how they chose their own destiny and life path under the torrent of the times. The film was shortlisted for the main competition unit of the 45th Berlin Film Festival and eventually won the Silver Bear Award for &quot;Outstanding Achievement&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 2000 &quot;Da Ming Gong Ci&quot;, to some extent, is the culmination of Li Shaohong&#39;s female perspective. This TV series has a score of 9.1 on Douban so far. Li Shaohong attributed this to &quot;considering the existence of historical figures from a female perspective&quot;, which also makes &quot;Ci of the Ming Dynasty&quot; different from previous historical dramas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After experiencing the reputation controversy of the TV series &quot;A Dream of Red Mansions&quot; (2010 version), for nearly ten years, Li Shaohong, as a director, rarely appeared in the film and television industry. During this period, she served as the president of the Chinese Directors Association and launched the &quot;Green Green Project&quot; to shift the focus of her work to supporting new talents. Thanks to the &quot;Green Green Project&quot;, the works of a group of new directors, especially female directors, have surfaced. Director Bai Xue&#39;s debut film &quot;Spring&quot; is one of the representatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Rediscover the existence of the other party&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;《世世&quot;With Her&quot; sets the timeline in the special year of 2020, showing the story of a mother-in-law and a daughter-in-law who fell ill during the epidemic. How could you think of setting such a time and such a female relationship? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Shaohong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It was during that time that everyone returned to their families. Usually we seem to be trapped by external affairs, all the goals we strive for, and the pressure of various jobs in society, and we neglect our family. When you encounter such a difficult period, you suddenly face your life, your relatives, and your role in the family. You will feel how important they are, and the feeling of dependence on each other is particularly strong. I naturally thought that from a female perspective, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law in the family are very representative. It is precisely because they themselves are ill that they can reflect a woman&#39;s sense of self-existence and the importance of her sense of family existence. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Most of the relationships between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law in previous film and television dramas were Full of contradictions and hostility, the relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law you showed in the film was not harmonious at the beginning. By the end, we saw a warm flow and understanding between women. How did this change occur? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Shaohong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Generally speaking, people think that in traditional and modern families, the two women are incompatible with each other. Many movies and TV shows The conflict between them is also expressed and reflected in the work. In fact, I think these two female characters have a lot of functional overlap: they are facing similar objects, son/husband, grandson/son, their ultimate goal is the same, they are all expressing an expression of love. , but if the expression is different and the focus of consideration is different, conflicts will arise. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I will give you an example of giving hairtail in the film, which is very typical. There are two families. The daughter-in-law played by Zhou Xun grew up eating fish without scaly eating, but in her husband&#39;s family, the mother-in-law grew up scaly, and there was a conflict between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law because of scaly eating. So while delivering hairtails, she called her husband to complain. Her husband didn&#39;t understand her complaints, so she was very angry and felt that she had nowhere to put her emotions. In fact, it is not about the hairtail, but the lack of sincere understanding between each other that causes conflicts between husband and wife and between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhou Xun repeatedly told her &quot;husband&quot;, &quot;You don&#39;t understand things between women.&quot; Later, she stood on the overpass in a daze, not knowing what to do. She wanted to be quiet and digest it by herself, and finally return to her family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have this kind of experience myself, especially when I don’t know what to do. But after you came back, you found that no one in the house, from the adults to the children to my husband, noticed that I had gone out. The few hours I left had no impact on the family, so I was very upset, but you can only digest it yourself. In the end, I couldn&#39;t help but say, &quot;Didn&#39;t you realize I wasn&#39;t here just now?&quot; It was very embarrassing. My husband said: &quot;Really, where have you been?&quot; With such a simple sentence, you feel that the value of this existence is not realized by others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of life experience may be experienced by every woman in life, but this time it is just seen on the screen. In fact, her husband was not aware of it, and no one was aware of her psychological changes. Later, when she returned home, her mother called, and she still used the state of saying that nothing had happened, like a little girl, to comfort her parents, &quot;Nothing happened, everything is fine.&quot; This touched her mother-in-law, and she realized how neglected they were towards each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“This is the feeling I want to express”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;As you said, there is a very important keyword in &quot;Her in the World&quot;, which is women&#39;s self-discovery, or self-understanding. This background runs through most of your works. In 1988, it was not obvious in your first film &quot;Silver Snake Murder&quot;. It was a very &quot;hard-core&quot; drama. Some even commented that it was more vigorous and spicy than the works of male directors. Many People speculate that among the male-dominated group of directors, did you deliberately hide your female identity? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Shaohong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, although it was already an era when women held up half the sky and advocated equality between men and women, it would allow you to put your The standard is to consider issues from a public perspective that downplays one’s own gender. In addition, &quot;Silver Snake Murder&quot; is a genre film. Genre films have no gender expression, so it must still have a genre perspective. At that time, I felt from a certain perspective that I could do anything a man could do, and the requirements of this genre were my standards. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;This transformation from unconsciousness to consciousness is How did it happen? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Shaohong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I experienced a big, conscious change in my self-awareness when I was filming &quot;Pink&quot;. When we first adapted Su Tong&#39;s novel, we went through a collective creative process. The screenwriter was Mr. Ni Zhen, and basically all of our main creators were men. The creative perspective initially focused on society’s transformation of these two prostitutes. In the process, I felt that it seemed to be getting further and further away from my earliest interest in this novel. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was about to shoot, I looked back and thought about what was the first impact Su Tong’s novel had on me. The most original impact was not how to transform them, but how they accepted the times. changes and transformations, and then how they choose their own destiny and the path of their own lives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the filming, I did a bold job, focusing all perspectives back on these two girls - how they were taken away by the boat one morning, how they How do they view the men they like, why Qiuyi chose to be a nun, how Xiaoe chose to live with this man, and how are their lives going? After the whole perspective was reversed, I suddenly felt that this was the feeling I wanted to express. All the experiences and feelings of the two women at that era have become the biggest feature of this film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the film was finished, it won the Silver Bear Award for Outstanding Achievement at the Berlin Film Festival. Then, in 1995, the World Congress on Women was held in China. After I participated in this conference as a representative, many The confusing question suddenly found the answer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For example? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Shaohong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I realize that if your standard is set on a male standard, and you especially want to follow a public consciousness, When you think about problems, you don’t think about them with individual consciousness. What you think about is a collective sense of existence, not an individual sense of existence. All these questions seem to be gradually guiding you, asking you to measure yourself according to other people&#39;s ideas and social requirements, as if your own existence is not aware of and valued, and you should restrain yourself. I was really surprised. I was sweating. I thought, God, how did I think about problems in the first half of my life? I never thought about myself. Is it a bad thing to think about myself? It doesn&#39;t seem wrong. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this time, I realized that when I was filming &quot;Pink&quot;, I had secretly thought about problems for women themselves, as if this was not wrong, and this inspiration and enlightenment was really right. I am too important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/09/15/fWOCPsR6IrUDsMVmhAdDVpIcNw3WzOqQRF6VmnUS.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1453&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/09/15/fWOCPsR6IrUDsMVmhAdDVpIcNw3WzOqQRF6VmnUS.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;208820&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zhou Xun and Li Shaohong have collaborated many times. The picture shows Princess Taiping (right) played by Zhou Xun in &quot;Ci of the Ming Dynasty&quot; (2000) to avoid marriage with Turks. A scene of a shadow puppet show performed by a Taoist nun in the temple. Princess Taiping has only a few entries in history books, but in Li Shaohong&#39;s works she becomes the protagonist who observes history. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Considering the existence of historical figures from a female perspective&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong >;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Da Ming Gong Ci&quot; can be said to be a masterpiece of expression from your female perspective, because before it, all historical dramas were dominated by men. The protagonist. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Shaohong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, because most historical dramas are from a historical perspective, and history is written by men, so naturally you use Tell stories from this perspective. After I gained this awareness, I consciously spoke from a female perspective, so you can see that I am talking about Wu Zetian and her daughter Princess Taiping. How did these two women control their own destiny in that era? . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Daming Palace Ci&quot; actually starts from Wu Zetian as a mother. The first child she gave birth to was a girl, who was strangled to death. Later, when she was 38 years old, she became pregnant with Princess Taiping, and she insisted on giving birth to her. All her subsequent actions towards Taiping were all caused by her compensation for herself and the child she had strangled to death. Princess Taiping is described in only a few sentences in &quot;Zi Zhi Tong Jian&quot;, which can be summarized as &quot;arrogance, extravagance and lewdness&quot;. But I think her reason is caused by the doting given to her by her mother. It is the original sin caused by self-salvation and mother&#39;s guilt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From all these angles, I think they consider the existence of historical figures from a female perspective, which also makes &quot;Ci of the Ming Dynasty&quot; different from previous historical dramas, which were rated as &quot;alternative&quot; at the time. . This shows that a historical figure has never been told from a female perspective. Maybe everyone did not recognize the existence of this drama at the time. This sentence saved me at the time, because when this show was first released, not everyone applauded it. Everyone is particularly questioning: Is this a historical drama? But its strong emotion and style make everyone find it refreshing, and they don’t know how to evaluate it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From your perspective, how do you interpret Wu Zetian? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Shaohong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;We don’t care whether Wu Zetian was an emperor in the end. At the beginning, she did not have this dream. Ordinary women living a good life. At that time, they were sent to the city to participate in the draft. This path was what girls of that era aspired to. From this perspective, her experience is the struggle history of an ordinary woman. She wanted to find a more ideal emotion in it, and then she found it. She cherished it, otherwise she would have almost been buried with it. In fact, she had been assigned to a nunnery, where she almost had to spend her life in a life worse than death. She tried every means to let others discover her existence. I think as a woman, this instinct of begging for survival is not an exaggeration at all. After she gets the possibility of survival, does she have to hold on tightly? She must try her best to manage it well, otherwise, she is likely to return to a situation where life is worse than death. All of this, I think about from the perspective of this woman’s survival and struggle. She really uses all her wisdom and ability to manage her family and husband-wife relationship. This is not wrong at all, and it is not simply He judged her as a poisonous woman. When survival pushed her to a desperate situation, she was forced to do it. And when her position was truly stabilized, the first person she wanted to repay was her child who died young. This child has always existed in her life, so she put all her guilt on the 38-year-old Princess Taiping. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wu Zetian lamented about her male favorite, &quot;A As long as you put a man into a woman&#39;s situation, he will become a woman.&quot; This is also a line that has not been seen in previous historical films. Looking at the issue from a female perspective, where did this line come from? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Shaohong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Just think in other people’s shoes, Wu Zetian also needs to think in other people’s shoes - why do you say I am a poisonous woman, why do you say I am ruthless, you change Thinking about it, do you think I can stop doing this? In order to protect my husband, protect his power, protect my children, and protect my family, I can do anything. So in her later years, she was so miserable that she couldn&#39;t even sit down and have dinner with four generations like an ordinary woman, and even her own son didn&#39;t dare to come. She felt that she had given so much and received so little. Her emotion was a great irony. I think this is history, allowing us to see a lot of ourselves from them. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“They are all very confident now”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;The female characters in the film have difficulties, and the actors themselves are no exception. Hai Qing and Yao Chen have previously expressed the &quot;workplace&quot; anxieties and dilemmas of middle-aged actresses, and Zhou Xun has also begun to play mothers. What do you think of these difficulties they face? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Shaohong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In fact, this kind of anxiety occurs at every stage of life, whether it is about work, family, or emotions. I think it’s not just married people like us, or people who are mothers, or people like Zhou Xun. For her age group, her experiences of marriage, family, and parents at different times must have existed. The accumulation of these experiences must have played a very sincere role in her portraying the roles of mother and wife. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think Zhou Xun is becoming more and more mature as she gets older. When we were filming &quot;Orange Is Red&quot;, it was difficult for her to find that kind of feeling when we were filming the fertility scene. It was hard to imagine, so we went through a process at that time and let her go into exile for a few days to slowly find this kind of feeling. Feel. Later, she lamented that the most important thing in performing is to express what you feel. You must first feel it before you can truly understand it and perform it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2005, I also filmed her playing the role of a mother. In &quot;Life and Death&quot;, I felt that she had grasped the character&#39;s pregnancy and childbirth very accurately. Now that she is filming &quot;Her&quot;, the role of mother is no longer difficult for her, so I think she has gone beyond whether she has done it when dealing with family relationships and the relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law in the film. A simple question like mother, but an insight into two women of different eras and ages. She asked her mother-in-law: &quot;Who are you living for?&quot; In fact, when she asked her mother-in-law, she also asked herself. When a woman is in her own stage, she will reflect and discover the value of her own existence from others, which transforms into self-salvation and self-awareness. I think she has grasped this point very accurately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You have always been a pioneer in female expression, but in the past few years, you have been a pioneer in female expression. Your expressions have become less. Is it because your desire to express yourself has decreased, or is there some other reason? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Shaohong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Overall, I feel that there is no decrease. I usually film one movie or one drama every two to three years. At the same time, We will also supervise and produce some of our own plays. But social work may be seen more by everyone, just because you want to support young directors. I have done the &quot;Green Green Project&quot; to support young directors, and I have also taken on some social work, such as the work of the Directors Association. It turns out that as a director, it is indeed an extra job. But gradually I still feel that supporting newcomers is very important for your own creation and movies. I am not doing the specific operations, I am just standing up for them. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Green Onion Project&quot; will be its seventh edition in 2022. I have discovered many young female directors in it, and there are more and more of them. I think female directors are quite capable, and I really hope to be able to help them in this regard. And unlike us at that time, they still have a process of self-awareness and awakening. I think they are very confident now and know very well that they need to use a female perspective and the movies in their hands to express themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 30 Sep 2023 22:25:05 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
