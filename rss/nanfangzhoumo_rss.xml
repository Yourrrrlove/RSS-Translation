Heavy rains of 150 to 240 millimeters caused severe flooding in many cities. The port city of Derna was particularly severely affected. The wind waves in the city center were as high as 20 feet. Two old dams on the Wadi Derna river in the upper reaches collapsed. After the floods raged, almost no intact building could be found in the entire city, and some residents were swept into the Mediterranean Sea with their houses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The United Nations stated on September 16 that the local death toll has exceeded 11,300, and another 10,100 people are still alive and dead. 40,000 people are homeless. There are still dead bodies soaked in the sea and no one has salvaged them. The number is bound to rise again. Libyan state-run media stated on the 17th that it is currently known that 891 buildings in Derna were completely destroyed, 211 buildings were partially destroyed, and 398 houses were soaked in mud after being flooded. The mayor&#39;s office speculated that the death toll could eventually reach 20,000 - equivalent to a fifth of the city&#39;s population. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the 17th, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs cited data from the World Health Organization and published a report, revising the death toll caused by the Libyan floods to 3,958, with more than 9,000 people missing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Derna is a city with a long history. &lt;/span>;) already exists. Amid the 2011 anti-government demonstrations in Libya, the city broke away from the control of Gaddafi&#39;s government on February 18. In 2014, the city was occupied by Islamic State militants, during which it was subjected to multiple air strikes by the Egyptian military. In 2015, the Derna Mujahideen Shura Council, a militia considered close to Al Qaeda, defeated the Islamic State and regained control of the city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, General Khalifa Haftar, regarded as the main authority in eastern Libya, has led the siege of Derna, the last territory in eastern Libya that has resisted his rule, with intensive bombing and brutal The ground fighting inflicted heavy losses on the city. In 2018, Haftar finally captured Derna. Haftar did not order a large-scale reconstruction of Derna out of distrust of its residents. It was not until 2022 that the eastern Libyan government formulated a reconstruction plan for Derna. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to years of war, Derna City does not have unified central government management, its infrastructure is old, and its ability to prevent and control floods is very weak. In recent years, global warming has caused the waters of the Mediterranean to expand, and rising sea levels have eroded coastlines and caused flooding, especially in low-lying coastal areas like Derna. On September 10, 2023, Hurricane Daniel made landfall on the Mediterranean coast of eastern Libya. The hurricane had already caused serious damage in Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria along the Mediterranean coast, resulting in more than a dozen deaths. However, the Libyan authorities did not seriously formulate a monitoring plan. There was no plan to warn or evacuate residents of the dam situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Libyan National Meteorological Center said it had issued warnings through emails and media 72 hours before &quot;Daniel&quot; made landfall, urging local governments to take preventive measures. However, the National Meteorological Center of Libya is affiliated to the Government of National Accord in the west, and Derna is an area controlled by the eastern government. Local residents said that they did not receive warning before the flood hit, and the authorities did not have any evacuation plan. They only heard the loud noise of the dam breaking. Only then did everyone realize that the flood was coming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The World Meteorological Organization pointed out on September 14 that if the Libyan authorities had an early warning system for storms and floods, the vast majority of the victims could have been prevented from dying. In other words, this disaster appears to be a natural disaster, but is actually a man-made disaster. In the future, after floods wash away, landmines and unexploded bombs left over from years of war may surface, and secondary disasters may occur where people accidentally touch landmines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the more than ten years since the fall of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, Libya has experienced one war after another and political crisis after another. To this day, it is still in a situation of confrontation between the eastern and western governments. . Many people have long forgotten this long dispute, but the floods that occurred in Derna, causing tens of thousands of deaths and missing people, once again drew people&#39;s attention back to this ill-fated place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/pviUluMz4LwOxQ6Ahu3w4waO28itNzjeEPzguqay.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;672&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/pviUluMz4LwOxQ6Ahu3w4waO28itNzjeEPzguqay.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251350&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 25, 2007, Tripoli, Libya, Libyan supreme leader Muammar Gaddafi (right) welcomed visiting French President Sarkozy&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa ;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;A divided country&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Libya has an area of ​​1.76 million square kilometers and a population of 6.7 million. It is located in northern Africa and the southern coast of the Mediterranean. To the east is Cyrenaica, to the west is Tripolitania, and to the southwest is Fezzan. There is a desert barrier between the three, making communication inconvenient. They have been separated for a long time in history. Due to the separation of the natural geographical environment, the eastern and western regions of Libya are closely connected with the surrounding Egypt, Tunisia and Algeria, but have little contact with each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Libya historically belonged to the Roman Empire, the Arab Empire and the Ottoman Turkish Empire, but these rulers regarded the above three regions as independent plates, so Libya has never been integrated into a unified entity in history. political community. Therefore, like most countries in the Middle East and North Africa, Libya is also a typical tribal country, and people identify with the tribe more than the country. During the period when it was ruled by the Arab Empire, it experienced the process of Islamization. Today, most people in Libya are Sunni believers in Islam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of the 20th century, the unified Italy also joined the ranks of colonial expansion and began to look for its own territory in Africa. It took a fancy to Libya under the rule of the Ottoman Empire, so it brazenly launched a war of aggression. In 1912, Italy defeated the Ottoman Empire in the Italian-Turkish War, making Libya an Italian colony. At the same time, the Senussi Order in eastern Cyrenaica launched a large-scale resistance movement in the name of &quot;holy war&quot;. The secular forces in the western region also actively resisted Italian aggression and even established the Republic of Tripoli in 1918. It was later banned and disbanded by Mussolini. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the end of World War II, in July 1949, the leader of the Senussi Order, Idris, declared the independence of Cyrenaica and served as the emir. In December 1951, Idris won the support of nationalist forces and tribes in three regions and finally established the United Kingdom of Libya. The three regions of Cyrenaica, Tripolitania and Fezzan were each a state with autonomy. right. The three colors on the current Libyan flag represent these three federal states and are symbols of federalism. In 1963, Libya&#39;s new constitution abolished the federal system and divided the country into 10 provinces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 1969, Gaddafi, the leader of the &quot;Free Officers Organization&quot;, launched a coup, overthrew the Idris dynasty and established the Libyan Arab Republic. Gaddafi, who was born in the Bedouin tribe of the Fezzan region, has ruled Libya for 42 years, relying mainly on strongman politics and centralization, coupled with distribution policies supported by oil revenue, to barely suppress tribalism and localism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Libya first discovered oil in 1958 and officially started production in 1961. Its oil reserves are approximately 47.1 billion barrels, ranking first in Africa and ninth in the world, accounting for 2.9% of the world&#39;s total. Crude oil has good quality and low sulfur content. It is a high-quality oil and is very popular in the international market. After 1973, with the sharp rise in international oil prices, the Gaddafi regime gained a lot of wealth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to avoid a recurrence of the tragedy of the fall of the Idris dynasty, and at the same time gain public support for his radical anti-imperialist stance, Gaddafi significantly increased investment in housing, health care, education and other fields, and increased workers&#39; wages. , and provide free public housing to the poor; the land originally belonging to the Senussi Order and Italian farmers will also be distributed to farmers, and farm tools and livestock will be provided at extremely low prices; new housing in rural areas can also be financed by government-controlled banks subsidy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But starting in the 1980s, due to the decline in international oil prices, Libyan oil revenue dropped sharply from US$21 billion in 1981 to US$5.4 billion in 1986. After the Lockerbie air crash in 1988, Libya was identified as the mastermind behind the crash and was subject to sanctions and embargoes by Western countries. In addition, oil field facilities are aging and oil production is ups and downs. There is no excess oil revenue to exchange for public support. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2010, 95% of Libya’s export revenue, 75% of government revenue, and 25% of GDP came from oil. At the same time, Libya’s domestic unemployment rate was as high as 30%, and most important infrastructure construction projects and crude oil extraction Projects are completed through international tenders and are completed by foreign companies and technical personnel, while a large number of Libya&#39;s own young labor force is unemployed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2010, the &quot;Arab Spring&quot; broke out in the Middle East, and Libya was also affected. Anti-government demonstrations occurred, and the government responded with force to suppress them. On February 27, 2011, the opposition established the &quot;National Transitional Council&quot; in Benghazi, Libya&#39;s second largest city. On March 19, Britain and France launched air strikes in Libya in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973. On September 16, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution to replace Libya&#39;s seat in the United Nations by the National Transitional Council. On October 20, Gaddafi was killed on his way to escape. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 11, 2012, in protest against a movie that insulted Islam, the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was attacked by an Islamic armed group. U.S. Ambassador Stevens was killed. The worst damage in years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/mzpx5TBpSLxfSfJJCWEvZMjsOtQwHjc2lgRNNRre.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;628&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/mzpx5TBpSLxfSfJJCWEvZMjsOtQwHjc2lgRNNRre.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251352&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;September 16, 2023, the disaster-stricken area of ​​Derna, Libya&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Post-Gaddafi era&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Libyan opposition is a group that includes defectors from the original Gaddafi regime, pro-Western liberals, eastern tribal leaders who are dissatisfied with Gaddafi and the dictatorship of western tribes, former Id A hodgepodge of supporters of the Reese royal family, the only thing they have in common is their dissatisfaction with Gaddafi. When the revolution has not yet succeeded, because the common enemy is still there, everyone has to seek common ground while reserving differences and work hard to cooperate. However, when the overall situation is determined, interests emerge, and the struggle for power is inevitable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To avoid infighting and division when sharing the fruits of the revolution, a leader with high moral integrity and the ability to reconcile various factions is necessary. However, during the 42 years of Gaddafi&#39;s rule, Libya had no president, no prime minister, no parliament, no cabinet, only Colonel Gaddafi. The imagination and passion of a generation were limited by the ubiquitous &quot;Green Book&quot;. How could it be possible? Such a politician appeared in a short period of time? In addition, after Gaddafi&#39;s army was disbanded, Libya failed to form a new national army. The existing militia groups strengthened their own forces and expanded their territory, causing the country to fall into a state of disorder. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During Gaddafi’s rule, Cyrenaica in the east was suppressed by him for a long time, and the locals were always very dissatisfied. After the &quot;Arab Spring&quot; took place, this was the first place where trouble broke out and started anew. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Libya was divided: the Government of National Accord and its armed forces recognized by the United Nations controlled most of western Libya, while the &quot;National Army&quot; led by Haftar controlled eastern and western Libya. Central Region. The two sides have clashed several times since 2014, and Libya has descended into civil war. The civil war continued until 2020, and the two sides finally reached a ceasefire. However, until now, the general election originally scheduled for 2021 has not been held, and sporadic fighting between the western armed forces and the eastern armed forces continues. Just last month, at least 45 people were killed in fighting between the two sides in Tripoli. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An important reason why the situation in Libya cannot be stabilized is the intervention of external forces. The Western Government of National Accord recognized by the United Nations has Turkey, Qatar and Italy as its backers, as well as Egypt, Russia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, and France. It supports the Haftar regime that controls the center and east. Italy wants to maintain the &quot;face&quot; of its former colonial master, Turkey wants to restore the glory of the &quot;Ottoman Empire&quot;... Each &quot;player&quot; has different reasons for entering the game. However, they seem to have the same goal behind them, which is the oil and natural gas resources in the Eastern Mediterranean. In the past ten years, a large amount of natural gas and oil have been discovered in this sea area. Libya and even the entire Eastern Mediterranean region have once again become a &quot;powder keg&quot; for various countries to engage in energy competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The consequences of disorder in Libya are not limited to the current out-of-control floods. After the fall of Gaddafi, the rebels looted the weapons arsenal of the government forces, and many weapons were transferred to other surrounding countries, especially extremist organizations. Chadian President Deby believes that the rise of extremist organizations such as the Nigerian terrorist organization &quot;Boko Haram&quot; , has a great relationship with the situation in Libya. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 23 Sep 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[共赴亚运之约！杭州第19届亚洲运动会开幕式]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257509]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-23 20:09:57&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 23 Sep 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[水为串联、潮为意向 亚运会开幕式主题定名《潮起亚细亚》]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257473]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-23 19:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou will open tonight.

&lt;p>;在三大篇章中，杭州五千多年文明史、千年宋韵文化与数字之城的特色融合展现。距今五千多年历史的良渚文化，让观众感悟文明之光照亮历史前进的力量；南宋时期的文化精神与现代文明智能的杭州，通过一座拱宸桥连接在一起，形成一场古今文化的对话和穿越；通过3D双威亚技术，气势磅礴的钱塘江大潮在观众面前全新呈现……&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;届时，通过地屏、立体透视网幕的配合，加之裸眼3D的视效与虚拟影像的设计，直接把行进的千里江山、江南烟雨、钱塘江潮和绿水青山都“搬”到舞台之上，营造人在画中走，画在景中游的景象。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/23/3f2db9212a4b5ea0998548e36ac08a8f.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;427&quot;

&lt;p>;最后时刻，可以看到古临安和今杭州古今对望的景象，导演组利用虚拟技术，将一幅万家灯火的古今相辉映的场景呈现在大众面前。 “相知无远近，万里尚为邻”，杭州将向全亚洲发出最诚挚的邀请。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;电子烟花期待拉满&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;为体现本届亚运会绿色、智能、节俭、文明的办赛理念，开幕式全程不燃放实体烟花。尽管没有盛大的烟花表演，但开幕式的精彩程度并不会因此而大打折扣。主创团队推陈出新，通过科技的力量，利用三维动画、AR技术等，将烟花展示在电视观众和现场观众之前。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/23/522cc071258c7f54ec6dba0b4830ef76.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;427&quot;

&lt;p>;虚拟技术制作的烟花，甚至比真实燃放的烟花更灿烂，更漂亮。为此，杭州亚运会开幕式总导演、总制作人沙晓岚还给出了观赏指南：大家通过电视、手机等端口观看开幕式电子烟花表演，整体观赏效果优于现场。主创团队将通过数字技术从仰、俯、侧视等角度，360度全景式展现钱江两岸、杭州奥体中心场馆群、“大莲花”的电子烟花表演盛况，这将是开幕式的一个高光时刻。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;点火仪式悬念将揭晓&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;点火仪式作为现代大型体育赛事的一项传统仪式，传递了运动会的精神和理念。而杭州亚运会的点火仪式，正是秉承了“绿色、智能、节俭、文明”的办赛理念，遵循“简约、安全、精彩”的办赛要求，环保中不失创意，科技感满满。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;本届杭州亚运会推出了亚运数字火炬，首创“亚运数字火炬手”这一概念，邀请全球网民争当亚运数字火炬手，参与线上火炬传递活动，让亚运火种的传递突破了时间、空间的限制。在23日晚的开幕式上，主创团队将以“数实融合”的形式完成主火炬点燃，创造亚运史上首个数字点火仪式。从目前的实时统计数字看，将会有超过1亿名数字火炬手参与进来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/23/edb657b938fa64cb2f741b5ba6f49727.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;427&quot;

&lt;p>;23日晚，每个线上、线下火炬手都是一个小火苗、一个发光点，汇聚在钱塘江上，形成一个具象“数字人”，踏着钱塘潮涌，步履坚定，奔向“大莲花”上空，打破时空壁垒，跃入185米立体网幕，和第六棒火炬手相会，“数实融合”点燃主火炬塔，完成点火仪式。谁将成为最后一棒火炬手，和上亿名数字火炬手共同点燃圣火？让我们共同期待！ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;

&lt;p>;“我在美国学的专业还是经济学，买房的钱拿去学经济，相当于花了一堆钱，学到我不该花这堆钱。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;玖姑把自己的经历放进短视频，用红底白字标上四个大字“失去特权”，成为玖姑视频账号里最火的内容。她有意为这条短视频添加带来流量的元素，“特权”，指向地域发展的不平衡以及贫富差距；“买不起房”，共鸣因房价而引起的普遍焦虑；“留学”，关联教育内卷和名校光环。她还在视频里抱猫抱狗，并且坦然地说出这一点：“也是为了流量。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在玖姑的讲述中，她将一手“好牌”打得稀烂，但实际上，她不觉得自己的选择是错的，她认为自己所做的事都在朝着一个目标行进——火成世界巨星。这个目标早早设立，从4岁开始，没经过可行性评估，全靠自信。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她将自己的网名改为“玖姑要火了”，毫不掩饰自己的野心和欲望。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那么，一个只想说大实话、素颜出镜、观点温和的人，真的能在当下的互联网中火起来吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/0eq17pfRpfExYoj6yLeFzpCsLV51ZCoWo5kh4tXw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/0eq17pfRpfExYoj6yLeFzpCsLV51ZCoWo5kh4tXw.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251343&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;玖姑在美国四处游历&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者提供/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;平均值&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;发现自己作为一个北京人却很难在北京买房这件事，让玖姑意识到自己错失了属于本地人的优势。那时候她从国外留学回来，不想一直和父母住，在北京租房，又碰上二房东卷钱跑路，加之工作不顺，她陷入了人生的低谷。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为什么会选择留学？玖姑认为主要原因是在学校被孤立。从小学到高中，玖姑就读于北京排名前五的公立学校，成绩随着年级的升高变得越来越重要。到了高中，玖姑觉得所有人都特别在乎成绩，只有学霸才会受到尊重，像她这样喜欢参加社团活动的人是不务正业的“异类”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;矛盾爆发于一次合唱节，玖姑负责组织排练，但班上同学认为排练挤占了学习时间，对合唱的排斥聚焦于玖姑个人身上，冷暴力像病毒一样传遍全班。玖姑觉得自己没有错，学校里的文科实验班经常有排演话剧、参加文体活动的机会，而普通班学生只能当观众，她不过是也想参与一次。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;玖姑从小喜欢搞活动，北京话叫攒局，比如在家里办春节联欢晚会，让家里人出节目。她想出国留学，早些年北京许多文艺策划人都有留学背景，以便接触更多的文化资源。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那是2010年前后，家里原本准备拿积蓄去买房，因为玖姑突然的决定，这笔钱转而用作她留学的费用。“当时觉得买房没有意义啊，何必把自己困在一个空间里面，外面广阔天地，大有作为。”在她的想象中，留学回来后，她会过上光鲜的、梦想的生活，每天攒局，出席活动。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;玖姑没能学喜欢的音乐剧，因为母亲觉得毕业后会找不到工作，于是她选了经济学，考入了美国加州大学戴维斯分校。选择经济学，是因为对营销感兴趣，她想知道，人们会因为什么而决定买一件东西。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后来她发现，经济学学的不是这个，毕业后工作一样难找。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;回顾自己的教育经历，尽管拥有优渥的教育资源，但玖姑觉得自己走了很多弯路。而有些人从小没有太多资源，却明确地知道自己想做什么，白手起家，例如乔小刀，“电焊工出身，在北京办艺术展，做民谣歌手，现在在大理做装置艺术。他是看书自学，一直朝着自己的方向走，不像我们，要先进学校，去考试，学会更多的为考试而学的东西，打压你真正想学的东西。出身在北京是我的特权，可这个环境只是在把我往平均值上拽。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;毕业回国后，玖姑参与过做创新教育的教辅公司，设计项目制学习课程，启发学生的创造力。她没做太长时间，因为发现国内的创新教育偏向“极端”。“一类是有钱人的特权，即使失败了，也有资源把孩子送到一个好的系统里去；一类是给底层辍学者或打工子弟提供再教育的学校。中间的人都在随大流。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/jTMHHDwvhx13OLfolt3PXAd4y77UrZI3vvdkMurM.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;为了拍短视频，玖姑将妆容化成一颗心&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者提供/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;主流之外&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在美国念大学时，玖姑从经济学转为心理学，并利用选修课机会学习大量感兴趣的语言学、音乐学的课程。学习之外，玖姑找到了更有趣的事情——在嬉皮士社区居住。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上世纪70年代，加州大学戴维斯分校为了探索可持续生活方式，发起了一次社区住房实验，建了一个独特的宿舍区。玖姑第一次看见那些白色半球体的小房子就觉得很酷，房子之间分布着花园、菜地、养鸡棚，她随后申请入住，一共住了三年。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;社区由居住者共同塑造，每周有一次社区会议，集体讨论公共决策，遵循共识原则，“所有人都同意要做一件事情，那件事情才能做”。每个工作日晚上大家在社区中心的毛毡房里聚餐，轮流做饭。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;起初面对强烈的文化差异时，玖姑有疏离感，她用一段长而缓慢的过程来适应，并希望保持更加平等的文化交互，她会在社区里发起中国文化活动，用原创诗歌朗诵（slam poetry）和脱口秀的形式介绍“我是谁”、“中国是什么”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;社区第一代居住者大多是参与过嬉皮士运动的青年，到玖姑入住时，社区仍然保留了对主权文化的批判精神，反性别歧视、种族歧视等，“不一样的是没有那么大的对抗性，没有那么激进，而更加持续。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;回国后，玖姑保持着对公共事务和平权议题的关心。看到一则一人大笑引发全车厢都在笑的视频后，她发起在地铁上传播笑声的行动，体验过后，她的感受是，“在想要笑的时候不再压制，大方地笑出来，我相信一定会有人回应。”有感于女性摇滚歌手少，她采访从事“非典型”职业的女性，探究职业对性别设立的壁垒。还加入女权主义小组，参与创作并演出了团队根据伊娃·恩斯勒的《阴道独白》原创的话剧《阴道之道》，创作女权相关的说唱歌曲。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但玖姑的事业并不顺利，她喜欢更有创意的工作，找的都是创业型公司，例如做创客教育、开发年轻人社交社群，失败率很高，“这些公司本身盈利也不好，最后都在走下坡路。”四年多的时间里，她换了六七份工作，2019年她又一次失业后，大半年没有找到工作，无论是创业型公司还是互联网大厂，她都没被录用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;摆在眼前最直接的一份工作是留学中介，一单佣金高达几万，但玖姑无法从心里认同这份工作，觉得没有意义，“它是一个有钱人的捷径，你只要有钱，就可以找人帮你写材料，可以包装自我。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;并且，留学归来做留学中介，“很难说明留学有前途”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2020年初，玖姑找到一份在上海的工作，母亲说她是北京的叛徒，“北京那么多工作你一个都找不着吗？”玖姑把这句话改成段子，“偌大的京城就容不下你了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这份工作也没能持续很久，两个月后她又被开除了。她不再找工作，自己开营销工作室，打造个人账号展示创意。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了提升热度，她决定成为一个网红。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/O05PXWYwVL73B42xg3PqMdxE8guoB35VPgt4PLOR.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/O05PXWYwVL73B42xg3PqMdxE8guoB35VPgt4PLOR.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;一次玖姑在线下的开放麦讲砸了，下台碰上李诞，问他怎么克服语言困境。李诞建议她多听郭德纲，她于是把德云社的综艺节目看了一遍，练口音，练语感，学习脱口秀的技巧，研究文字结构。她的脱口秀商演从仅有8个人看，逐渐变成30人、60人、700人，收入开始超过本职工作。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她把自己的失业、脱单失败和所有世俗标准里的不成功写入脱口秀段子，通过自我消解来引发观众对负面情绪的共鸣。但她自称没有为过去后悔过，如她在视频中所说，“我说这些失败的经历并不意味着我不自信，我正是因为自信，才敢把这些失败的经历都拿出来当素材。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年，以脱口秀演员的身份，玖姑参与拍摄一档线下相亲纪录片。或许是为了增加冲突感，节目组给28岁的玖姑安排了一位61岁的男相亲对象老邬，比她爸年纪还大一岁。节目播出后，玖姑的片段引发了大量争议和讨论。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;打招呼时，老邬故作幽默地说“好久不见”，问她“你觉得今天黄浦江美吗？”玖姑直接回，“在这看不见江。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;老邬摆出一副说教的态度，“你觉得女性要独立吗？”玖姑反问，“什么叫独立？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;老邬引经据典，“你看过西蒙·波伏娃的《第二性》吗？他们在实验，如何把女性从第二性变成女性为第一性。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;玖姑不接招，“我不觉得波伏娃在女权这个话题上比我更懂，我也不觉得我比她更懂。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;节目中的表现让玖姑小火了一把，她开始坚持每日更新视频，趁着时机做红账号。相亲时谈到的女权，成为她的第一个流量点。玖姑不谈理论，不讲学术，有出版社给她寄女性主义书籍，在拍短视频时，她直言自己没看，“对于女权的理解，我都是从我的生活经验中亲自提炼出来的，我也不觉得这些所谓社会地位比我高的权威，比我更懂我的女权诉求。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管玖姑认为自己主张的是性别平权，甚至写过“男女平等的油腻”“爱干嘛干嘛，媚男也可以，媚女也可以”这样的段子，但是她的性别权利观点不断引来争议，有网友指责她是“女权”，也有网友骂她“媚男”。玖姑时不时地会“回击”这些评论。她发现“性别对立”的确是流量密码，有对立就会有争议，有争议评论数就会高，就容易被算法推荐。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而当她使用“平权”时，却被视频平台认定为“不符合社区规范”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最吸引流量的还是追热点，“平台推流量跟热点直接相关，只要是热点，甭管你说得多差都有，有热点跟没热点是质的区别，流量至少相差10倍。”2023年9月份，玖姑所追的热点包括“秀才直播间被封”“茅台咖啡”“李佳琦直播间翻车”等等，虽然追热点，但她表示不说一句违背内心意愿的话。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于中老年阿姨打赏秀才，玖姑说，“咱们女人操劳了半辈子，就应该花钱让自己爽。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;拉踩他人也是引流的一种方式，“可以让他们粉丝来骂你，增加我的热度。”比如玖姑拉踩过另一个网红曲曲，“她还是不如我，因为她教你取悦别人，而我教你自洽……虽然我单身没钱皮肤还差，但我很自洽，我想说什么就说什么，而且还能火。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;面对蹭流量、拉踩的指责，玖姑非常坦然，“对啊，那就是一种营销手段，做营销人必须要做的事儿，我还摆在明面上呢。”拉踩曲曲的那则视频封面上就写着四个大字——“拉踩同行”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“保持真实吧，我发现大家都太不真实了。”玖姑说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/3van6XHDJ2rAF6FAJ3i56jKkLcrL9GsFYAI2T7v0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot;

text-align: center;&quot;>;线下相亲纪录片《想要问问你敢不敢》&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者提供/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;成为世界巨星&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;玖姑视频最大的特点之一是素颜出镜，并且不加滤镜。她的理由也很真实，“我可是日更啊，每天化妆30分钟多累啊，我又化不好。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;几乎每一期视频下方都有对她外貌指指点点的言论，“化上点什么吧，看不下去了。”几乎没有女性网红不化妆，这塑造了网络的审美和礼貌准则，有的网友即便不从美丑的角度去评判，也会指责玖姑对人不尊重，“公共场合，化好妆，收拾利索点，是对自己也是对别人的尊重。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;玖姑坚信这不是自己的问题，用短视频回击，“如果你觉得我不化妆就是不尊重你，那你根本就不值得被尊重，如果你看别人不顺眼还非得说出来，那是你眼睛有问题，喜欢评论别人外貌的人本身都没什么教养。”视频最后她又用自我调侃来消解严肃的气氛，“不像我，不化妆也超美丽，化完妆后还不如不化。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;评论区或许还算得上是言语温和的地方，私信里的网络暴力泛滥成灾，玖姑收到过无数条带着脏话和黄色笑话的辱骂。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;单从他们的名称、头像和账号内容上看，很难想象他们平时会对人如此不客气，有叫“温柔知进退”的人说“你爸妈怎么敢把你生出来啊”，有头像是学士服照片的人反复说她“丑逼”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;玖姑的自信让她没有感到受伤害，但也不想沉默，她几次发视频，主张用“网抱”抵制“网暴”，“我无法控制别人对我评论的恶意，我也可以选择不被他们影响，而是主动传播善意，把世界往我想要的样子推一把。”因为一个谈论女性主义的视频引起过评论区“性别对立”的争吵后，为了不制造对立，她用“平权”来替代“女权”，因为想做“解决问题的人”，她将视频整理出一个合集，名称是“解决男女对立”，解释关于性别和权利的偏见。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;玖姑在网上的人气为她的营销工作室带来不少订单，也为她的生活增添了很多乐趣。“我在现实里特别单调，我没有办公室，没有同事，如果不上网，我很少跟人聊天，就去朋友店里坐一坐。”即便在网上会收到大量的负面言论，但在现实里，人和人之间的交流全部被压在了平静之下。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;玖姑觉得自己现在已经很火了，每天都有四五个人在路上认出她，每条视频的流量数据都不错。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但还不够，她的目标是火成世界巨星。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“成为巨星之后呢？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“影响世界，去做有价值的事，消除贫困，提倡环保，给女性赋能。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 23 Sep 2023 18:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[运动员如何开启亚运生活？南周记者带你探营运动员村]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257474]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-23 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 23 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一起冲“亚” | 杭州亚运会专题报道]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257329]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-23 16:29:12&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;The 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou opens today (September 23), and the world’s attention is once again focused on China.

In March 2022, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued the &quot;Regulations on the Internet Protection of Minors (Draft for Comments)&quot;, which set forth requirements for the responsibilities of parents, schools and platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A year and a half later, the bill was passed. Sun Hongyan, director of the Children&#39;s Research Institute of the China Youth Research Center, analyzed to Southern Weekend reporters that there are currently 191 million minor Internet users, and the rate of minors accessing the Internet has reached 96.8%, showing the characteristics of large groups and younger age, and the introduction of special Regulations on the protection of minors on the Internet are inevitable. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Why is the time span as long as 7 years? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From the release of the &quot;Regulations on the Internet Protection of Minors (Draft for Comments)&quot; in September 2016 to the release of the &quot;Regulations on the Internet Protection of Minors (Draft for Comments)&quot; in March 2022 》, which spans five and a half years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;21st Century Business Herald&quot; quoted Yao Zhiwei, a professor at the School of Law of Guangdong University of Finance and Economics, as saying that one of the main reasons why the two releases were so long apart is that the higher-level legal minors protection law did not exist at the time. It is of little practical significance to revise and separately formulate and issue regulations on the online protection of minors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2020, the Law on the Protection of Minors was revised for the second time, adding new provisions related to online protection. This change is of great significance to the introduction of regulations on the protection of minors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Hongyan believes that the newly revised Law on the Protection of Minors has added a special chapter on Internet protection, which is nearly 10,000 words long, and a large part of it is about Internet protection. This makes the Regulations on the Internet Protection of Minors The newly revised Law on the Protection of Minors can be used to provide more detailed provisions on network protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2021, the 30th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 13th National People&#39;s Congress voted to pass the Personal Information Protection Law. The law added a special chapter on network protection to protect minors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 30, 2021, the State Press and Publication Administration issued the &quot;Notice on Further Strict Management to Effectively Prevent Minors from Addicting to Online Games&quot;, which aims to strictly implement the real-name system and limit game duration. Solve the problem of online game addiction among minors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the seven years it took before and after, Sun Hongyan analyzed, “During this period, experts from different disciplines and fields also conducted multiple rounds of discussions, revisions, and improvements. Regulations cannot just be a call-to-action, so specific requirements are particularly needed. , operable regulations as action guidelines.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2023, the process of legalization of minors&#39; online protection is accelerating. In May 2023, the State Council&#39;s 2023 legislative work plan mentioned the &quot;Regulations on the Internet Protection of Minors&quot;, which was among the 17 draft administrative regulations to be reviewed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two months later, in July 2023, the Ministry of Justice and the Cyberspace Administration of China conducted a special study and review of the &quot;Regulations on the Internet Protection of Minors (Draft)&quot; to accelerate the legislative process of the regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 20, 2023, when the State Council executive meeting reviewed and approved the &quot;Regulations on the Internet Protection of Minors (Draft)&quot;, it was pointed out that it is necessary to build a solid legal support for the Internet protection of minors. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;How to classify user age more scientifically? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The 2016 draft had a total of 36 items. By 2022, the draft has been expanded to 67 items. The main content is divided into 4 parts: strengthening the cultivation of network literacy among minors, Strengthen the regulation of online information content, strengthen the protection of minors&#39; personal information, and strengthen the prevention and treatment of minors&#39; Internet addiction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;Sun Hongyan analyzed that the draft regulations passed this time will have two obvious characteristics: detailed provisions and specific provisions on many problems that minors may encounter on the Internet; and operable The responsibilities of parents, schools, platforms and other entities have been stipulated in detail, so that &quot;three monks will not be left without water to drink.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Ning, director of the Law Department of the School of Cultural Industry Management of Communication University of China, also analyzed the Southern Weekend reporter. Judging from the previous draft for comments, this draft focuses on the improvement of Internet literacy and Internet minors. Issues such as personal information protection, network anti-addiction, etc. In addition, the &quot;youth mode&quot; on smart terminal products has been upgraded to &quot;underage mode&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Hongyan also noticed that although multi-level government departments have relevant requirements, the applicable age threshold for &quot;youth mode&quot; set by many social apps is in name only. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her conclusion is that guardians do not have a strong awareness of protecting minors and do not even know how to set up a youth mode. They always want to put all responsibilities on the major platforms, but the platforms lack good content. pool, resulting in &quot;teen mode&quot; failing to attract teenagers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Ning emphasized that the draft regulations passed this time “have also systematically organized and stipulated the obligations and responsibilities of Internet companies in the protection of minors, especially requiring them to carry out corresponding social Responsibility Assessment”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;郑宁进一步解释，目前企业在未成年人保护方面投入的动力不足，要有比较充足的内容供应才能再做用户分龄，给不同年龄段的用户提供不同的内容，“未成年人保护实际上对企业来说更多地是履行社会责任，需要投入大量的成本，很多企业缺乏动力。客观来讲，有一些企业也没有能力去采购大量的、有版权的内容。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 23 Sep 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[新情景喜剧《鹊刀门传奇》]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257440]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-23 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/20/qBDTFnpRo1XELhYjuM1A5VRL7zpx5B9x1lsrUzsa.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/ qBDTFnpRo1XELhYjuM1A5VRL7zpx5B9x1lsrUzsa.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251393&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2023, the martial arts sitcom &quot;The Legend of the Magpie Sword&quot; will be launched. The play stars Zhao Benshan and tells the story of the inside of the Magpie Sword in the world. a series of stories. After 40 episodes, the Douban score was 8.1, and the audience regained the familiar taste of domestic sitcoms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development of sitcoms in my country can be summarized into several stages. In the early 1990s, works such as &quot;The Story of the Editorial Office&quot; and &quot;I Love My Family&quot; appeared, winning the ratings at the time and marking the beginning of China&#39;s local indoor sitcoms. The scenes in this form are relatively simple and fixed. The stories and jokes usually unfold between several characters. The language is vivid and rich in philosophy. It was loved by the audience at that time. In the ten years from 2000 to 2009, sitcoms developed rapidly. Well-known works such as &quot;The Story of the Cooking Class&quot;, &quot;Wulin Gaiden&quot; and &quot;A Daughter in the Family&quot; are still watched and discussed repeatedly by audiences. They have broad influence and a significant long-tail effect. However, after 2010, there are few similar classic sitcoms on the market, and related creations seem to have entered a period of stagnation. The reasons are, first of all, because the development of the Internet and short videos has profoundly changed the way the public watches, making it easier for the audience to get jokes; secondly, sitcoms are limited to the content of &quot;parents&#39; short stories&quot; and are difficult to expand in other fields. It is also an important reason for his loneliness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The appearance of &quot;Legend of Magpie Sword&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as &quot;Legend of Magpie Sword&quot; &lt;/span>;) breaks the tradition The sitcom has a single indoor scene, but the scenes in the play are diverse, both indoors and outdoors, and martial arts elements are integrated into it. The high-quality fighting scenes and a lot of baggage and plots that follow current events make the audience feel fresh and new. In addition, Zhao Benshan The performance of the comedian doubled the comedy effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Aidou Media Screenwriting Studio stated that it has always wanted to create dramas with a strong sense of contrast. The planners and screenwriters in the team are very fond of Jin Yong&#39;s martial arts works. Everyone generally believes that in recent years, there have been no traditional martial arts works that meet the standards they want. And because the team has a high &quot;content&quot; of Northeasterners, everyone joked that they would create &quot;Northeastern literature and art&quot; &quot;Revival&quot;, therefore, the idea of ​​&quot;a martial arts comedy starring Zhao Benshan and taking place in the Northeast&quot; was born. This was the initial idea of ​​&quot;Magpie Sword Gate&quot;. In addition, one of the directors, Wu Di, is a world martial arts champion. He once participated in Tsui Hark&#39;s &quot;Flying Swords of Dragon Gate&quot; and has his own opinions on martial arts and martial arts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of &quot;Magpie Sword Sect&quot;, Zhao Benshan plays a pair of twin brothers, one is Ximen Changhai, the head of the Magpie Sword Sect who is highly skilled in martial arts, and the other is the timid cook Ximen Changzai. He had to go out for important matters, so in order to stabilize the hearts of both people inside and outside, he asked Chang Zai to be his substitute, which led to a ridiculous storyline that followed. This &quot;dual identity&quot; setting is the basis for the dramatic and comedic effects of the opening chapter. But in fact, this setting was not included in the original script, because Zhao Benshan was confused about &quot;how to play a hero well.&quot; The screenwriting team thought about how to make Zhao Benshan feel like a &quot;hero&quot; and make this character more interesting. level, so I thought, let &quot;the characters in the play come to this martial arts world just like Zhao Benshan doesn&#39;t understand martial arts in reality&quot;, so that his performance will be very comfortable and natural. Therefore, the screenwriter designed two brothers who look the same, one is a hero and the other is a cook, with Zhao Benshan playing two roles. The studio explained: &quot;This is very consistent with Teacher Zhao&#39;s current state. He does not need to really know much about martial arts. The real hero is performing the task. The replacement comes to the martial arts world, and the replacement is the state of Teacher Zhao himself.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/pL2jTW2MAbI8Whm9ea6pDkEx4NiGkE9jgU0IeCdV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;540&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/pL2jTW2MAbI8Whm9ea6pDkEx4NiGkE9jgU0IeCdV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251392&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Except Zhao Benshan plays the leader of the Magpie Sect, and his disciples all have different personalities. In the impression of Chinese audiences, martial arts are often romantic, and the protagonists are all fairy-like and beautiful characters. &quot;Magpie Sword Gate&quot; breaks this inertial perception. The hero is an old man, the heroine is an old lady, and the apprentices are all silly, foolish, and stupid in their own way. The studio said that from the perspective of comedy creation, contrast must be set. These characters first contrast with the heroes in the traditional martial arts world. They want to be &quot;people in martial arts&quot; in the real world - they are Reckless played by Song Xiaofeng. The idiot second apprentice Zhao Dezhu and the silly eldest apprentice Hao Meng played by Cheng Ye; of course, there must be someone who is not so stupid and can take on the audience&#39;s perspective, that is Jiang Yulang played by Wensong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Magpie Sword Gate&quot; is essentially a sitcom. If you want to do something different, the creator&#39;s approach is: the fight is real, and the funny is really funny. The large story structure and main line of this drama are left to the screenwriters who normally work on drama series. In addition, several screenwriting teams are set up to be responsible for submitting contrasting topics. Then the screenwriters work together to see what interesting topics can be arranged into the story, screen the topics multiple times, and ensure the quality and comedy effect through voting, interpretation, etc. The screenwriter of the selected topic needs to implement the burden of these topics based on the number of episodes he has been assigned and the development nodes and status of the corresponding characters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the barrage during the broadcast of &quot;Magpie Blade Gate&quot;, the audience applauded for the play&#39;s satire on domestic entertainment chaos. Many scenes follow hot topics and are spicy and sharp. For example, in order to become famous in the world, the sect in the play seeks the help of a storyteller to help arrange bizarre life experiences, hype up shocking scandals, and gain popularity; Position&quot;, the contestants obtained rankings through secret operations and character design, and immediately cut leeks to make quick money after their debut... All of this satirizes the strange phenomena in most of today&#39;s entertainment industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the final presentation of the series was good, the main creator still remembers some difficulties when looking back on the creative process: &quot;The most difficult thing is communicating with the actors.&quot; Because there are many people in the team Young screenwriters, many of whom are &quot;5G surfers&quot;, will inevitably incorporate the latest hot events and jokes into their scripts. Most of the actors are born in the 70s and 80s, and Zhao Benshan is even born in the 50s. How to make them truly understand the things in the script? A difficult point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The second most difficult part is the martial arts part.&quot; Because the director is a martial arts athlete, he has very high requirements for fighting scenes, but the comedian is not a martial arts actor after all, so the running-in process for this part is also quite intense. In the end, the fighting scenes in &quot;Magpie Sword Gate&quot; received many praises. The action moves are simple and neat, and have a traditional martial arts atmosphere. According to the creative team, this was a firm request from the director. &quot;We must make everyone believe that this world is real, and that is by returning to nature and fighting for real.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the opinion of the main creator, the show is made for the audience, and the audience&#39;s laughter is more important than anything else. In addition to &quot;laughing&quot;, what &quot;Magpie Sword Gate&quot; wants to convey and express is probably the word &quot;xia&quot;. As the ending of the play shows, being a hero is not about how much kung fu you know, but about a pattern and attitude towards doing things. “就是想给每一个在自己岗位上奋斗的普通人说这句话，虽然大家没有做那种传统意义上的英雄，但其实我们在自己的生活中已经是一个英雄了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 23 Sep 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
