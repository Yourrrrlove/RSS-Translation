It was raining lightly in the early morning. Director Wei Shujun thanked everyone for coming to watch the movie before the movie started. He said that it was also raining in the first scene of the movie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/92420c0a65a420316ddf9fdfdb6c6732.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;658&quot; height=&quot;923&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/92420c0a65a420316ddf9fdfdb6c6732.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255188&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The opening rain scene of the film takes us back to the southern town in the 1990s. The cold weather, dilapidated buildings, dim light, and cramped alleys, the space presented in the film The texture is distant yet familiar. A series of bizarre murder cases lead the pursuers of the truth into the abyss of madness. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As a shortlisted film in this year&#39;s Cannes &quot;Un Certain Regard&quot; section, &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; scored a high score of 3.5 points in the Cannes program&lt;/span>;&lt; span>;. As the opening film of the just-concluded Pingyao International Film Festival, this film once again received high praise from many film critics. &lt;span>;Since the short film &quot;Yanbian Boy&quot; debuted in Cannes in 2018, in just 5 years, every feature film directed by Wei Shujun has been favored by Cannes. Such excellent results are rare among the post-90s generation of directors. Its right. &lt;/span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Wei Shujun’s first two works, &quot;The Parting of the Wild Horse&#39;s Mane&quot; and &quot;Stories of Yong&#39;an Town&quot;, have a very obvious personal color, not only in terms of plot, but also in the story. This kind of personal experience narration also includes a preference for meta-film narrative. Cannes&#39; favor is undoubtedly a recognition of Wei Shujun&#39;s creative talent and potential, but these two previous works are still young and immature. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/076b56ce199a61d4ff049d4328a9f286.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;725&quot; height=&quot;321&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/076b56ce199a61d4ff049d4328a9f286.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255186 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The &quot;Mistake by the River&quot; shows a self-contained temperament, marking Wei Shujun&#39;s maturity in creation. Of course, on the one hand, this is due to the original novels with more humanistic value and interpretation space provided by Yu Hua. On the other hand, it is also the more professional and skilled performance of the creative team under the control of industrialization and commerciality. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/bdd362b284cc8f585bda60da8f8bef25.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/bdd362b284cc8f585bda60da8f8bef25.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255185 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; is a pioneering experimental novella, published in 1988, and is Yu Hua&#39;s early work. Yu Hua mentioned in the interview that Lu Xiaoya and Zhang Yimou both wanted to adapt this work, but neither of them came to fruition, which proves the difficulty of adapting this novel into a movie. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;When describing the creative process of &quot;Alive&quot;, Wang Bin mentioned that the first thing he recommended to Zhang Yimou was &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; by Yu Hua. At that time, &quot;Alive&quot; Not fully published yet. After reading it, Zhang Yimou worried that the characters in &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; were too symbolic. In the process of continuous discussion, Zhang Yimou also constructed an almost brand-new story, with more realistic characters and plots, and obviously more Zhang Yimou&#39;s style - this story has a female as the protagonist. It&#39;s just that this idea went nowhere. Zhang Yimou was later completely attracted by &quot;Alive&quot;, thus creating a classic in Chinese film history. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After more than thirty years, in the hands of a younger generation of creators, &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; has taken on a new glory. Wei Shujun and screenwriter Kang Chunlei&#39;s adaptation has no concerns of the times or historical considerations. Baggage is a bold addition, deletion, disassembly and reconstruction based on the original work. It not only grasps the absurd nature of the original work, but also injects it with an expression that is closer to the current mental state. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/5fe8b80026b408a31f2ac5ae24f08669.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/5fe8b80026b408a31f2ac5ae24f08669.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255190&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The pursuit of the truth in Yu Hua&#39;s original work is the author&#39;s analysis of madness and civilization during the cultural renaissance wave in the late 1980s. The protagonist Ma Zhe was eventually diagnosed as a &quot;madman&quot;. It is an ironic social naming. In the movie version, as Ma Zhe gradually becomes a madman, he encounters individuals being crushed by authority, the uncertainty of memory, and black humorous coincidences in the process of solving crimes. Near the end of the movie, a change of viewpoint in one shot shows that Ma Zhe has finally become a madman, and is even more proactive than Ma Zhe in the novel. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In that era in my memory, lunatics were common. Some liked to sing in the yard late at night, and some liked to tease others on the street. In today&#39;s era, we almost no longer see lunatics in public places, but more and more people entertain themselves as &quot;mentally ill.&quot; The different understandings of the symptoms of &quot;madman&quot; in the two eras may correspond to the different spiritual cores displayed by the two generations of creators in their treatment of novels and film texts. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/9d3a92c4251420384063fe14d67f7c51.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/9d3a92c4251420384063fe14d67f7c51.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255189 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yu Hua said, &quot;Only fools are loyal to the original work.&quot; The movie &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; is a smart and successful adaptation. The realistic texture created by Wei Shujun visually highlights the absurdity and the eerie atmosphere that makes people think deeply. The 16mm film shooting gives the film a retro tone, presenting the sense of small town space of that era, with occasional out-of-focus lenses, and even provides a stylistic expression for the theme of uncertainty. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The film&#39;s representation of the people and events in the unit of that era, as well as scenes such as the poetry meeting, is by no means a realistic reproduction. The director uses a slightly exaggerated satire, but more subtly conveys the reality of the times that makes people laugh. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Ma Zhe, played by Zhu Yilong, also provides a wonderful screen image for this retro realistic texture. In order to interpret this role more accurately, Zhu Yilong went to Nanfeng, the filming location, to experience life in advance. He found inspiration for his appearance from an old photo of Yu Hua, and first gained weight and then lost weight for this role. His experiential performance created an amazing character. A convincing image of Ma Zhe. So far, this role is the biggest screen breakthrough for Zhu Yilong, who is still labeled as a traffic star, and will lay the foundation for his future as a big screen actor. In other words, we see one thing from him: acting skills are more important than traffic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/4d2519bd4e8e9a251834b9bc08856dba.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/4d2519bd4e8e9a251834b9bc08856dba.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255187&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;span>;Wei Shujun, who prefers meta-movies, said that &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; is no longer a meta-movie. &lt;/span>;However, in the film, a movie theater that is about to be demolished is used as the working space for handling the case. The gaze and being gazed created by the camera&#39;s perspective, as well as the presentation of the chaos of dreams and reality, all demonstrate the director&#39;s meta-cinematic interest. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Similar to the original work, &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; has a detective-themed genre shell, but the direction of the plot and the author&#39;s stylized treatment broke the expectations of genre suspense. . Moreover, it also abandons the avant-garde nature of the original work and uses a linear narrative as the main line, but it is by no means in line with the public&#39;s imagination. Therefore, we need to look at the market performance of this movie with caution. But regardless of whether it&#39;s good or bad at the box office, this is a work with a unique temperament. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 16:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[孙一钿：即将到来]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259484]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/25/lAsQWMSOeodnf7QCdK12dexC0WyrUcK0OvPbqZTe.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/lAsQWMSOeodnf7QCdK12dexC0WyrUcK0OvP bqZTe. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255445&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Andrea Rossetti/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the &quot;post-90s&quot; who are active in the contemporary art circle, Sun Yidian is undoubtedly the lucky one who has a good hand. She is the kind of international artist favored by galleries and academic institutions. The creator is also the darling of fashion brands and the collection market. Her works involve painting, installation, performance, and fashion cross-border... In her twenties, not long after leaving the Central American School, she was named &quot;Outstanding Youth Under 30&quot; by Forbes Asia &quot;, and in the past two years, he has won the &quot;Young Artist of the Year&quot; from The Best of Best in 2022 and the &quot;Outstanding Creator of the Year&quot; from the Chinese version of the Wall Street Journal in 2022-2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023 will be an intense year for Sun Yidian. She returned to school and studied for a doctorate in literature and art at Tsinghua University. She has continued domestic group exhibitions and overseas exhibitions. In April, she held a solo exhibition in Berlin. Portrait&quot; opens, followed by the solo exhibition &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; in Paris on October 17th (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;&lt;/span>; ). Her iconic plastic dolls come from Western pop culture, but also contain Eastern codes. They have formed a unique accent in the old building of the landmark Place Fontaine in Paris: foreign viewers will smell the familiarity of the illustrations. A subtle touch of exoticism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ph.D. supervisor Wang Minan once suggested that she complete her doctoral studies in a dual-thread approach: painting during the day and studying at night. But in fact, it is difficult to operate. &quot;Painting is still very brain-burning. After painting for a whole day, it is really difficult to read academic works at night.&quot; So she divided the time into different intervals: before the exhibition, she would retreat and paint intensively. , and then start the academic mode after all the paintings have been shipped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/IPytwWYqQQjX4FS4Yis8WejWuPCzF83Bh8eRStto.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/IPytwWYqQQjX4FS4Yis8WejWuPCzF83Bh8eRStto.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255432&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2018, &quot;A twinkle&quot;, Shanghai, BANK Gallery&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Five Ren Studio in Beijing&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In September, Wu Hongce In the &quot;Crossing Boundaries - Possibilities and Echoes&quot; exhibition at the Yuz Museum, Sun Yizhen met again with her previous work &quot;Pink Dinosaur with Blue Wings&quot;, which was her work around 2017. The entire &quot;man-made object&quot; &quot;The representative work shortly after the series started, &quot;I have never seen it again after the exhibition.&quot; When I met face to face in the exhibition hall five years later, &quot;it was exactly the same as seeing a long-lost friend or child. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;You will recall the scene when you painted it, and even recall every stroke you drew. That moment was 3 o&#39;clock in the afternoon, and when you drew that stroke, the sun happened to shine. The place where you put down the pen, yes, suddenly, that memory was retrieved from your subconscious...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The memories all came back in an instant, and a painting opened the door to the past for her. A wormhole, not only about that painting, but also a whole set of life wrapped up in that painting: At that time, she was still in graduate school, and she shared a studio in Feijia Village with her friends at the time. There was an artificial pond there. In summer, the pond is crowded with lotus leaves and lotus flowers, and people living around it are all engaged in art. The next door neighbor is a dancer and a photographer. They visit each other all day long, go fishing in the pond, and eat big pot rice: stewed turtle, spicy crayfish... …spent many lively nights, like a utopia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is an elegy for collective life, which died out almost simultaneously with the student days. &quot;Now I have no collective life, only work is left.&quot; On the wall of the studio with small sketches, you can see the work Traces of madness: The exhibition schedule is accurate to every day, and is made into a list and posted in a conspicuous place; in an inconspicuous place, a whole row of &quot;45&quot; is densely written in pencil, and many of the &quot;45&quot; have been crossed out. ——This is the way good student Sun Yidian forces herself to focus on painting. She believes that every 45 minutes is a period of concentration. This is how the school&#39;s classes are set up. After every 45 minutes of serious painting, she will She crossed it out and allowed herself a small recess: she once liked using highly saturated fluorescent colors, which overloaded her eyes after long hours of homework and staring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/BaVQHStk7Nt3jSUleSOHrwNw0XOXUbTuUiNWbfRY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/BaVQHStk7Nt3jSUleSOHrwNw0XOXUbTuUiNWbfRY.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255434&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Crossing Boundaries: Possibilities and Echoes&quot; exhibition view, Yuz Museum, Shanghai, 2023&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Alessandro Wang, Yuz Museum/Photo )&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is Sun Yidian’s fifth studio in Beijing, and it is also the one she considers “the most luxurious”. The so-called luxury means that it has heating and air conditioning, and has a high roof, ceiling windows, which bring in stable natural light, and large-open doors to facilitate the transportation of large-scale works. The second and third floors are storage rooms and bedrooms. There is a shelf large enough to store her past works, and a bed where she can lie down when she stays up late to paint - this is all an easel artist desires. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other studios before can only be described as crude and homeless. She would count them on her fingers: the first studio was in Ark Court, a residential building next to Central Academy of Fine Arts. The space and light were cramped, and it was impossible to display large paintings. The size of the painting was slightly larger, and the relationship between colors was inconsistent. The depth is just not right. The second one was in Feijia Village. It was a happy time, but it was demolished and a group of artists were driven away as if they were being expelled. The third studio was near the turkey factory. One summer there was a sudden flood and most of her paintings were soaked. So she fled there and moved to the mainland. The fourth studio has no heating in winter and no air conditioning in summer. She spent three winters in this ice cave, painting with her feet on a small electric carpet. Her hands became cold and stiff after a while, so she could only put them under her buttocks to warm them up before continuing to paint. Her mother came to see her from Wenzhou and felt the extremely cold weather that had never been seen in the south. At night, the surroundings of the studio were pitch black and there were no street lights. She couldn&#39;t help shouting: Daughter! What kind of sin have you suffered here? ! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/XgzliM17Uhji4QMm2nlJC71KUgC9DGMrnP5WQ8VH.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;738&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/XgzliM17Uhji4QMm2nlJC71KUgC9DGMrnP5WQ8VH.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255448&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Once upon a time&quot; Acrylic on canvas, 205cmx158cm, 2023&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;A painting can be painted this way, or it can be painted that way&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Mother He was probably the first person to provide artistic support to Sun Yidian. When she was a child, her parents enrolled her in many interest classes. She was the child who cried when she saw she was about to play the piano, but she was very active in painting. She started studying painting at the age of 4. When she was in elementary school, her parents let her attend Wenzhou Youth Art School. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other provinces in China, this kind of professional art school for primary school students is extremely rare, which corresponds to the strong demand for folk art education in the southeastern coast. These primary school students are cultivated by an almost omnipotent art concept. They have to learn Chinese painting as well as Western painting. Sketching, coloring, and sketching are all necessary basic skills. They have to go to the countryside to sketch, and they have to hand in calligraphy homework every week. &quot;Our primary school has actually trained many people. For example, the Asian Games torch was designed by our seniors, including architects and artists currently active in Zhejiang. If you ask, many of them came from this primary school.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;In the art circle, it is very strange to praise a person with &quot;top student&quot;, but Sun Yidian has indeed been a top student all the way. Her elementary school does not relax its requirements for cultural courses just because it majors in art. Many students will later go to ordinary middle schools and comprehensive universities, and not all of them may be bent on becoming art students. Sun Yidian was admitted to Wenzhou Middle School, the best local high school, but at the same time, she also received admission notices from the National High School Affiliated to the National Academy of Arts and the Central American High School Affiliated to the Art Examination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/tlKnhoKUFJ4monMgkf7h5D6BTlFtFh8FzkurTiM0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;732&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/tlKnhoKUFJ4monMgkf7h5D6BTlFtFh8FzkurTiM0.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255449&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Simple Shed&quot; watercolor on paper, 25.3cmx19.1cm, 2009&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She chose the High School Affiliated to Central Academy of Fine Arts because she could go to Beijing and legitimately &quot;leave&quot; Parents stay away.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Sun Yidian, the High School Affiliated to Central Academy of Fine Arts is a free and magical place. She seemed to be suddenly opened up to a whole new world and new senses to match it. She is still amazed that she watched so many niche movies and so many esoteric books that were inappropriate for her age when she was in the attached middle school. &quot;There are many big boring movies that I can&#39;t stand now, but I actually watched them wholeheartedly at that time. Many of them In fact, I only know a little about philosophy books, so I just read them hard to pretend to be cool. People around me don’t listen to pop music. They all listen to very literary and niche things to show that they are different.” In the attached middle school, not being mainstream is a kind of mainstream. These hard-to-eat nutrients have unknowingly become part of her background. “The biggest inspiration for my art is that I am willing to try anything and be interested in everything. After a person is suddenly opened up at that age, he realizes , It turns out that a painting can be done this way or that way.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She still keeps a collection of sketches from when she was in the attached middle school. At that time, she had to submit a large number of sketches every week, and the teacher would write on the handed-in homework. The stamp indicates that it has been read, preventing students from submitting previous works for submission. In order to catch up on the huge amount of homework, they would go to Beijing Railway Station to stay up all night and paint the passengers who stayed at the station overnight. Foreigners from all over the world come in all shapes and sizes, and they don&#39;t move even after falling asleep due to fatigue. They are ready-made models at your fingertips. When she returned home during the summer vacation, while her mother was taking a bath, she was doing sketches of human figures. Her mother calmly let her do the painting without any hesitation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After graduating from the High School Affiliated to the Central Academy of Fine Arts, she was recommended to the Central Academy of Fine Arts. Her college entrance examination scores in cultural subjects were surprisingly high among art students. After graduating from Central America, he was directly recommended to graduate school at Central America. Sun Yidian said that she is the kind of person with strong self-motivation, and her academic career is just &quot;going with the flow&quot;. It was also out of self-consciousness that after working as an artist for several years, she went to Tsinghua University to study for a Ph.D. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/BGK6BCcuRR8Ks5wz3wSVfM4ulvO5VlLwx2jScva5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;801&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/BGK6BCcuRR8Ks5wz3wSVfM4ulvO5VlLwx2jScva5.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255451&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Ken&quot; acrylic on wood, 45.5cmx38cm, 2019&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Natural objects and man-made objects&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Sun Yidian is well-known and has the best market performance The series is &quot;artificial objects&quot;, and most of the pictures are inflatable or plastic toys, but she also has a secret &quot;natural objects&quot; series, which she started to create when she was 16 years old, a series oriented &quot;from the deep&quot;, including flowers and fruits. , mountains, rivers, and trees have all become the objects of her gaze and representation. But the &quot;natural objects&quot; have never been exhibited. Sun Yidian hangs them on the wall of his studio, like a private archive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Man-made objects&quot; are dazzling floats above the water, and &quot;natural objects&quot; are like anchors underwater. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Many people came to my studio and liked the &#39;Natural Objects&#39; series. Last time a sister came over and said that this group of small paintings made her cry.&quot; She incorporated a lot of elements into this series. For media experiments, I like to use some children’s handmade materials, such as a kind of baby foam beads called “pearl mud”, which can be used for shaping and is also a common raw material in toy factories. Later, I discovered a Japanese paper pulp clay that has excellent modeling power and durability, and can create a spatial effect similar to a bas-relief on the painting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/RSyN0FWPkp9junVXBGZKFsIqxs7A2MxJSf78DO2v.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;639&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/RSyN0FWPkp9junVXBGZKFsIqxs7A2MxJSf78DO2v.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255450&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Let Me Hug&quot; Acrylic on canvas, 200cmx133cm, 2015&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Artificial Objects&quot; series made her famous in one fell swoop. The smooth, plump, grotesque and falsely sweet toys she draws have won her a steady stream of attention and collectors, and their prices have skyrocketed. As a child in Wenzhou, her childhood memories are all kinds of man-made objects. &quot;When I was a kid, when we said we were going to play at a classmate&#39;s house, what we actually meant was: go play in your family&#39;s factory.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Almost every household has a factory, including a shoe factory. , glasses factory, plastic products factory, lighter factory... Occasionally there are toy factories. There are not many toy factories, but the visual impact on a child is huge. These small commodity factories all retain a simple production layout. The factory building often has several bedrooms attached. The home is also the same as the factory. After the reform and opening up, materials, and the production brought about by materials, sprouted up everywhere in Wenzhou like bamboo shoots after a rain. What’s interesting is that her international collectors are also very sympathetic to these things she painted. They told Sun Yidian: The era when the artificial objects you painted suddenly exploded in abundance, maybe the 1990s in China. But in Europe and the United States, it was our 1960s. It is precisely because of this that they feel the same complex flavor of nostalgia and reflection in Sun Yidian&#39;s paintings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of commonality is not uncommon in Sun Yidian’s paintings, like a hidden cultural code. She paints huge idols. Their appearance and facial features are common in Western pop culture. However, the curved eyebrows and single eyelids come from traditional Chinese painting. The angle of the lips, which seems to be smiling but not smiling, is her classic image based on Buddhist sculptures. drawn. This image appears on the exhibition wall, facing the viewer in a overlooking manner. Regardless of whether the viewer is an Easterner or a Westerner, they will be slightly stunned and realize that something seems wrong in a sense of déjà vu. The &quot;Porcelain Mother&quot; she painted is a small white porcelain statue with hands clasped together, standing silently among the roots of the trees. This is a common porcelain Madonna ornament in Western families, but strangely, it also Much like the Dehua white porcelain Guanyin worshiped in Chinese homes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Yidian said that in her hometown, the belief system is complex. When she was a child, her family worshiped Buddha and worshiped Guanyin all year round. However, when she came to her uncle&#39;s house, he believed in Catholicism and kept a statue of the Virgin Mary in his home. As a child, she often felt confused. In her eyes, there was no essential difference between the kind and compassionate female faces. The localization of handicrafts has deepened this aesthetic mutual reference. A priest often came and went from her uncle&#39;s house. Apart from his detached and indifferent expression, she could not see any difference between the priest and ordinary neighbors. The same goes for the local church, which is European in form but with a strong Chinese decoration style. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She is keen to examine these common clues in different cultures out of curiosity about images. She painted Medusa and looked through Caravaggio and other classic paintings in the album. The snakes on Medusa&#39;s head were all live snakes. The artist had to focus on painting the twisting and entangled violence, lifelike, that is culture. Classic output to her symbols. In her private memory, Medusa only saw the logo on her mother&#39;s Versace bag when she was a child. She was surprised at that time. Why use the head of a strange woman as a label? In order to draw her own Medusa, she bought a bunch of rubber and plastic coiled snakes online as a reference. Their ferocity and beauty were just a bluff - &quot;I just wanted to draw them all as fake snakes, realistic fake ones.&quot; .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her workbench is filled with these artificial toys, which have also become the prototypes in her paintings: original Barbie, pirated Barbie, Ken with his head ripped off, naked Ken... The first time she drew Ken with only a head, she shocked everyone and triggered a big discussion including hot words such as &quot;feminism&quot;, &quot;female revenge&quot;, &quot;consumer men&quot;, and &quot;female reverse gaze&quot;, but she Frankly speaking, I painted my friend as Ken just for visual reasons, which is like playing house on the canvas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/88ewe2kyK2hNwTUJjLor3sygbg00B5xHTLl3i9k8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;956&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/88ewe2kyK2hNwTUJjLor3sygbg00B5xHTLl3i9k8.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255447&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Evening&quot; wood board composite material, 20cmx20cm, 2016&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The world is seven centimeters shorter&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Sun Yidian has always been interested in gender issues All are there. When she was in college, she asked acquaintances in her hometown to let her go to the obstetrics and gynecology hospital to observe women giving birth. It was the largest obstetrics and gynecology hospital in Wenzhou and the place where she was born. She saw groups of women rolling and moaning on the delivery bed. Their faces were blurred, and all their female characteristics were hidden. What mattered was the huge bulge in the middle of the body and the birth canal that was about to burst, as if that was their only thing at the moment. Biological attributes, their common identity and destiny. She turned this feeling into a series of works, titled &quot;Coming Soon.&quot; That year, she was 22 years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is &quot;coming&quot; may be new life, or the adult life she is about to enter. But for Sun Yidian, &quot;coming soon&quot; is more like a moment in nature, &quot;In my hometown, there are many thunderstorms in the south, the kind of heavy rainstorms that suddenly fall, and the sky is so dark that the day seems like night, The raindrops were huge, pouring, and then there was lightning and thunder. I have many such memories when I was a child. I stood under the window of my house and looked at the heavy rain outside. The sky suddenly lightened up, and then there was a burst of thunder from the distance. . My &#39;coming soon&#39; is the moment when the lightning has flashed and the thunder has not yet come. I am nervous and scared, but I am also looking forward to that moment coming.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She did not explain her scene, no matter how It’s up to the viewers to draw their own interpretations, whether it’s gender issues, pop culture issues, material issues, consumerism issues... She is at ease with everything. Just like her painting &quot;Porcelain Mother&quot;, those who believe in Guanyin see Guanyin and the Mother of God. What the viewer sees is the Virgin. She believes that any viewing will first reflect the viewer’s cultural memory and information reserve, rather than the creator’s intention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As her doctoral thesis was about to be started, Wang Minan suggested that she write about consumerism. The implication was that it was related to the topic she drew, and it would be easier for her to gain insights when writing. She also thought it was reasonable. She is just worried that her logical ability is not strong - the academic construction of writing a paper and the picture composition that she is so familiar with are completely different things. Teacher Wang sometimes asks her from the perspective of &quot;consumption&quot;: I heard that one of your paintings has sold for millions? She was so frightened that she only waved her hands: Teacher, teacher, let’s never talk about this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/UfQY7vrtFQzxgrxEuiFVap805CGeMwvUOhSpJIQB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/UfQY7vrtFQzxgrxEuiFVap805CGeMwvUOhSpJIQB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255446&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Porcelain Mother&quot; Acrylic on wood, 54cm x 45cm, 2023&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Ailing said that you must become famous as early as possible. Sun Yidian agreed with both hands, but her reasons were different from Zhang Ailing. What she worries about is not that success comes too late and the taste is not sweet enough, but she believes that becoming famous at a young age can give people a valuable sense of relaxation and allow them to do art more calmly and comfortably. Those artists who have been tortured by fate for too long and have struggled to overcome all kinds of struggles are sometimes inevitably distorted by the desire for success and the pressure of survival, leading to deformed movements and making incredible choices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Only the income from selling paintings in my first exhibition was meaningful to me, because it meant that I could support myself and become an independent artist. Before that, I had always followed My parents were vaccinated and asked to be mentally prepared that I might not have a job after graduation and would have to go home to grow old. That money gave me great freedom. The happiness from money ended here. After that, I sold Any high price offered is just a number to me.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She naturally realized that as long as the female artists of her generation made some progress in their careers, they would inevitably work for all women. speak out. &quot;When a female artist becomes famous at a young age, it is easy for others to say: Is it because of your appearance? Is there someone behind you who is helping you raise the price?&quot; Is it impossible for women to achieve success based on their strength alone? Is it hard to acknowledge the excellence of women? Sun Yidian&#39;s way of fighting back is to use more comprehensive self-strength to shut them up. This is the self-confidence she built up as a top student from childhood to college, and it is also one of the motivations for her to return to school to study for a Ph.D. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the many sketches nailed to the wall of her studio, there are several sketches of powerful high-heeled shoes. The toes of the scarlet high-heeled shoes are joined together and formed into one with the heels on separate sides. The shape of the female pelvis. Sun Yizhen always remembers a poem by a Taiwanese male poet that he read when he was a girl. He wrote about the feelings of girls when they wear high heels - &quot;The world is seven centimeters shorter.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Yidian is 1.72 meters tall. He wears 7cm artificial high heels and is taller than many men. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a world seven centimeters shorter, she continued to move forward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the artist, BANK Gallery and Galerie Schipper Berlin/Paris/Seoul, Yuz Museum)&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https ://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 15:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“潇湘”作为地名传进日本，竟然是因为一位禅宗大画家的加持？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259334]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Not long ago, I had a gathering with two old friends. During the dinner, I accidentally talked about the misfortune of Nie Er, the composer of &quot;March of the Volunteers&quot; The place of drowning - the coast of Shonan in Fujisawa Prefecture, Japan. Wang Zhongyi, the editor-in-chief of &quot;People&#39;s China&quot; magazine, asked me about the relationship between Shonan and Naito Hunan and Hunan Province. I knew what was going on but didn&#39;t know why. I was questioned on the spot. So, after returning home and doing some homework, I came up with this fake &quot;place name test&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/iAnaBLpu5DQSiWI3mbKe9wYDfzszNsGMp2b7u9wI.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;891&quot; height= &quot;1185&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/iAnaBLpu5DQSiWI3mbKe9wYDfzszNsGMp2b7u9wI.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255549&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Japanese Sinologist Naito Konan (1866-1934). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let’s talk about the latter first. The relationship between Naito Hunan and Hunan Province is simple, so simple that there is no half-cent relationship. Naito&#39;s halo as a sinologist is so dazzling that when Chinese people talk about this legendary figure, they often make associations: the &quot;Hunan&quot; in Naito&#39;s name must have been &quot;taken&quot; from Hunan Province, and is intentionally or unintentionally reminiscent of When it comes to the &quot;theory of cultural center movement&quot; and the &quot;theory of changes in the Tang and Song Dynasties&quot;, it seems that if you don&#39;t even &quot;roll&quot; your name, you can&#39;t be called a great scholar. However, Japanese intellectuals are mostly limited by the concept of regionalism and take it for granted. Since he is a leader of the Kyoto School, the name &quot;Hunan&quot; must come from Hunan City in Shiga Prefecture adjacent to Kyoto Prefecture, but this lake is not Dongting Lake, but Lake Biwa. In fact, neither of these two arguments is correct. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Naito Hunan&#39;s name is Tiger Jiro, whose courtesy name is Bingqing and whose nickname is Hunan. In 1866, he was born in Mamauchi Village, Mutsu Province (now Mamauchi, Towada, Shikaku City, Akita Prefecture). Shikaku is located at the northernmost tip of Akita Prefecture, separated from Aomori Prefecture by the boundary lake &quot;Lake Towada&quot;. &quot;Hunan&quot; means the south of Lake Towada. Lake Towada is a double volcanic lake formed by the eruption of the Towada volcano. It has beautiful scenery and is a famous lake in the Tohoku region. It is listed as a &quot;National Cultural Property&quot; as a special scenic spot. In the National Diet Building in the center of Tokyo, huge oil paintings depicting the four seasons of the Japanese archipelago hang on the walls surrounding the central hall. Among them, the summer work is &quot;Lake Towada and Oirase&quot; painted by Tanaka Giichi. In this way, due to the influence of Naito&#39;s Hunan and Kyoto schools, Hunan Province, which was originally out of reach, was forced to be disconnected. Even Hunan City, Shiga Prefecture, which had nothing to do with it, was attached to some kind of connection with Naito, and Naito Lake Towada, my hometown where I grew up, is not mentioned by the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/Wvjin72u69Lnqd8pGj5ChHbXG2N2MlN21dU2dMKS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height= &quot;403&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/Wvjin72u69Lnqd8pGj5ChHbXG2N2MlN21dU2dMKS.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255550&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The oil painting &quot;Lake Towada and Oirase&quot; hanging in the central hall of the Japanese Diet Building. Oirase is a river flowing from Lake Towada. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let’s talk about the former. There is actually no definite conclusion about the connection between Shonan and Hunan Province. Although the interpretation of &quot;Southern Hunan&quot; in &quot;Guangciyuan&quot; (fifth edition) refers to it, it is not clear: ① The name of the scenic spot south of the Xiangjiang River that flows into Dongting Lake in Hunan Province, China. ② The &quot;Sōnan&quot; in the southern part of the ancient Sagami Kingdom was appended to ① and written as &quot;Shonan&quot; as the name for the coastal area of ​​Sagami Bay. That area includes Hayama, Zushi, Kamakura, Chigasaki and other areas. There are many bathing beaches in the summer, making it a summer resort for Keihin. The winter is relatively warm. It is widely developed as residential land. For example, &quot;Shonan Electric Railway&quot; is the general name of the old national railways that connect Tokyo and Numazu (Shizuoka Prefecture) over a medium distance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through this explanation, we understand that without Hunan in China, there would be no Shonan in Japan. The next question is: when and how did this spatial &quot;link&quot; occur? In Japan, the expression &quot;Shonan&quot; was first seen in the dictionary &quot;Wa Ming Le Ju Chao&quot; (referred to as &quot;Wa Ming Chao&quot; or &quot;Wa Ming Chao&quot;) in the middle of the Heian period. The etymology is Shonan County, Changsha State. According to the explanation of &quot;Zizhi Tongjian Dictionary&quot; (Jilin People&#39;s Publishing House, 1994): Xiangnan County was &quot;established in the Western Han Dynasty, and its administrative location is southwest of Xiangtan City, Hunan Province. It was changed to the Marquis of Xiangnan in the Eastern Han Dynasty. In the Three Kingdoms, Wu restored it to Xiangnan County. The Southern Dynasties Waste all.” However, &quot;Shonan&quot; in &quot;Japanese Names&quot; is still a simple ancient Chinese place name and is not equivalent to &quot;Shonan&quot; in Japan today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Various evidence shows that the real &quot;crossing of the border&quot; in southern Hunan is related to Zen Buddhism. Mr. Ge Zhaoguang mentioned in &quot;The History of Chinese Zen Thought&quot; that Southern Zen is divided into two branches geographically, and the second branch is the &quot;Zen master group centered on Jingzhou and Hengyue&quot;:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For example, Fa Nao and Fa Ren of Jingzhou Emperor Temple, Fa Jing and Zhiyuan of Changsha Temple, Fa Cong of Xiangyang Jingkong Temple, Lushan Fa Chong wait. Of course, the most important thing is Huisi (515-577) who first went to Daesu Mountain in Gwangju and then to Hengyue, and opened the later Tiantai line. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Tiantai Sect is the sect that has had a decisive influence on Japanese Buddhism and Zen Buddhism. In 804 AD, Zen Master Saicho went to the Tang Dynasty to study Dharma as an envoy to the Tang Dynasty. After returning to China the following year, he taught Dharma at the Enryaku Temple on Mount Hiei (also known as Mount Tiantai), and then founded the Tendai Sect of Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Muxi Fachang, a painting monk from the late Song Dynasty to the early Yuan Dynasty (Fachang is the Buddhist name, his birth and death dates are unknown), practiced Zen under the famous monk Wu Zhun when he was young, and later became the founder of Liutong Temple in West Lake. At the end of the Kamakura period (14th century), his paintings flowed into Japan in batches following the exchanges between Chinese and Japanese Zen masters, and they were immediately enthusiastically sought after by the upper class. The technique of using ink halos and a large amount of white space to express the beauty of the universe is superb and sophisticated. It is the &quot;symbol of the literati&#39;s longing for an utopia of natural mountains and rivers&quot; in the eyes of the Japanese (Japanese scholar Yuji Yamashita said), and it has also profoundly influenced Japan. of southern painting. The great Japanese painting masters of the Momoyama period, Hasegawa Tōhoku, Omotaya Sotatsu and others, all sought the foundation of ink painting techniques from Makiki&#39;s paintings; there are also many works that imitated Makiki in the Kano School of art. Muxi&#39;s paintings are the objects of collection by Japanese ministers, daimyo and wealthy businessmen. They are national treasures among national treasures. For example, in the &quot;Catalog of Imperial Paintings&quot;, a record of the painting treasures collected by the Ashikaga family of the Muromachi shogunate, of the total 280 pieces in the collection, Makixi&#39;s works accounted for 30%, as many as 103 pieces. In Japanese documents from the mid-14th century, if only &quot;monk&quot; is written, it is an honorific title for Muxi. Muxi&#39;s paintings are almost extinct in China (only the National Palace Museum and the National Palace Museum in Taipei hold one each). It is said that 134 paintings exist in Japan, all of which are stored in the treasure collections of the Cabinet Office for Culture and the country&#39;s first-class art museums. The &quot;ceiling&quot; of Mu Xi&#39;s work is generally recognized as &quot;Eight Scenes of Xiaoxiang&quot;. Seven of the eight volumes are in Japan. The location of the remaining volume, &quot;Yamaichi Seiran&quot;, is still unknown and a copy is preserved in Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/Cpej7mByBiUAd7Aqq2Ejiw6c3nmf2eEu7a3P27DL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;3197&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/Cpej7mByBiUAd7Aqq2Ejiw6c3nmf2eEu7a3P27DL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255548&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Fishing Village Sunset&quot; from Muxi Fachang&#39;s &quot;Eight Scenes of Xiaoxiang&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called &quot;Xiaoxiang&quot;, the definition of &quot;Cihai&quot; is: ①Another name for the Xiangjiang River, because the water of the Xiangjiang River is clear Well-earned reputation. &quot;The Book of Mountains and Seas·Zhongshan Jing&quot;: &quot;The abyss of the Xiaoxiang River.&quot; &quot;The Book of Xiangzhong&quot;: &quot;The clear light of the Xiangchuan River is five or six feet long, which is the name of Xiaoxiang.&quot; Or it may specifically refer to the section after the middle reaches of the Xiangjiang River meets the Xiaoshui River. That is one of the &quot;Three Hunans&quot;. ②Refers generally to the Hunan region. Zheng Gu&#39;s poem &quot;Farewell to Friends on Huaishang&quot;: &quot;Several bagpipes left the pavilion at night, you went to Xiaoxiang and I went to Qin.&quot; ③The name of the ancient town. It was placed in the Five Dynasties in the northwest of Yongzhou City, Hunan Province. It is named because it is the confluence of Xiaoxiang River and Xiangkou Pass; it is also called Xiaoxiang Pass or Xiangkou Pass. Accordingly, as the name suggests, the &quot;Eight Scenic Spots of Xiaoxiang&quot; refer to the eight scenic spots from the north along the Xiangjiang River to Dongting Lake after the Xiangjiang River merges into the Xiaoshui River. Since the Northern Song Dynasty, some painters have used it as a theme to create works, expressing their feelings for the landscape. The &quot;Eight Scenes of Xiaoxiang&quot; has almost become an artistic paradigm. Famous ones include the scroll of the same name by Song Di, which was later written down by Shen Kuo in &quot;Mengxi Bi Tan&quot;, including Fan Return from Yuanpu, Falling Geese on Pingsha, Evening Bell of Yansi Temple, Qinglan in Mountain City, Dusk Snow in River Sky, Autumn Moon in Dongting, Sunset in Fishing Village, Xiaoxiang Night Talk - the name of &quot;Eight Scenes&quot;, has since &quot;out of the circle&quot;. However, compared with the works of Song Di and others, the Japanese clearly prefer Mu Xi. As for the reason, the philosopher Han Bingzhe believes:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Mu Xi&#39;s &quot;Eight Scenes of Xiaoxiang&quot; inspired by Zen Buddhism is also &quot; The picture of &quot;empty&quot;, the pen and ink are simple and subtle, there is nothingness, the artistic conception is mysterious, a few scenes are hidden in the infinite white space, the careful brushwork makes the objects float between reality and virtuality, black and white, and there is no way to express it. meaning. Objects and images are integrated and dependent on each other, reflecting each other instead of driving away or dividing each other. Sora seems to have become a friendly intermediary. Water lives, mountains flow, heaven and earth unite. The emptiness and silence do not obliterate the still life in the painting, but reflect the elegance of the still life. (&quot;Zen Philosophy&quot;, page 35)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this way, from the Kamakura period to the Edo period, from the Ashikaga Shogun family (Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, Yoshimasa) to Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, from the Tokugawa Shogun family (Tokugawa Ieyasu, Yoshimune) to Matsudaira Fumo and Murata Shuguang, Muxi&#39;s &quot;Eight Views of Xiaoxiang&quot; has been circulated among these figures, and its value can no longer be evaluated in terms of money. The Japanese really love the &quot;Eight Scenes of Xiaoxiang&quot; so much that they can&#39;t wait to move them to Japan. Sure enough, later the Japanese &quot;discovered&quot; the &quot;Eight Views of Kanazawa&quot; in the area of ​​Rokuura Village in Musashi Kunakurajo County (today&#39;s Kanazawa Eight Views Station of the Keihin Express Railway) - the whole is a &quot;Hako Garden&quot; version of the &quot;Eight Views of Xiaoxiang&quot; . The wonderful thing is that every scenic spot corresponds to the original scenery of Xiaoxiang, and it was adapted into Ukiyo-e paintings by Utagawa Hiroshige, including &quot;The Return of the Sailing Ship&quot;, &quot;The Falling Geese&quot;, &quot;The Evening Bell&quot;, &quot;Susaki Haru&quot; &quot;Arashi&quot;, &quot;Uchigawa Evening Snow&quot;, &quot;Seto Autumn Moon&quot;, &quot;Noshima Sunset&quot; and &quot;Koizumi Night Voice&quot;, a total of eight paintings. In the 7th year of Yuanlu (1694), Zen Master Donggao Xinyue, who fled to Japan from the Ming Dynasty, wrote a Chinese poem for each of the &quot;Eight Scenes of Kanze&quot;. With the endorsement of the seven-character quatrains of the Chinese great scholar, Kanze was like Xiaoxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is said that in the early Edo period, the monk Sawuan began to call the Enoshima area &quot;Shonan&quot;. During the same period, Chongxue, a descendant of the Chinese who immigrated to Japan from China during the Muromachi period and an expectorant medicine merchant in Odawara, built a stone tablet at the Oiso nunnery, on which he engraved the seven words &quot;The end of the Qing Dynasty in southern Hunan&quot;. This monument still exists today and is regarded as the beginning of place names in southern Hunan. Before modern times, Sinology was always a prominent school in Japan. Therefore, whether it was due to a certain literary taste or arty elegance, there were many Zen monks and poets who used &quot;Shonan&quot; as their nickname, such as the Zen monk Shonan Tong, the poet Okubo Shonan, etc. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the opening of the Shonan Electric Railway, the area known as &quot;Shonan&quot; further expanded, and even the Miura Peninsula was included in its division. In May of the 29th year of Meiji (1896), Tokutomi Soho bought a villa on the Zushi Seaside for his parents, and then handed over the task of taking care of the two elders to his younger brother Tokutomi Akasha, and he embarked on a journey around the world. At that time, Luhua was physically and mentally exhausted and tired of the dissolute life. She decided to temporarily go to her parents&#39; villa to live in seclusion while thinking about her future. He wrote in a letter to his brother: &quot;The air in Tokyo is too cold for me. I want to live in Shonan for some time.&quot; At that time, Shonan had become a residential area for the upper class. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also at about the same time, Natsume Soseki and Suzuki Daijo each practiced Zen under Enkaku-ji Temple in Kita-Kamakura with the Zen master Shaksumi. Soseki practiced Zen for self-healing, while Dachu practiced Zen for the purpose of learning the Dharma. Time and space intersect, the two have neither the same purpose nor have they met. Since the Kamakura shogunate era, the shogunate rulers have been protected by the clan, and Zen Buddhism has been able to live and develop here. After five centuries of development, by the time Soseki and Daijo practiced Zen, it had become a grand sight. Kamakura, an ancient temple, was lined with many The ancient city, which is full of Zen, has also become a true &quot;Mecca&quot; of Zen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this way, from the &quot;Eight Scenes of Xiaoxiang&quot; by Muxi Fachang to the &quot;Eight Scenes of Kanze&quot;, from the monk Ze&#39;an to the Chinese Zen master who fled eastward, it can be said that it is precisely because of the blessing of Zen. This long and narrow coastal area, centered on Enoshima and extending east and west along Sagami Bay, has changed from the ancient place name &quot;Sōnan&quot; to the &quot;Shonan&quot; in the eyes of the world today. It has a unique atmosphere that is completely different from other regions. Romantic style. For example, if people living in the metropolitan area drive a car with a &quot;Shonan&quot; license plate on National Highway 134 on weekends, even if it is just an ordinary light motor vehicle, it is still a cool thing. Its &quot;gold content&quot; even surpasses the high-end residential area &quot;Shinagawa&quot; in Tokyo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Original title &quot;Where is Southern Hunan&quot;, the current title was proposed by the editor)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[学术期刊为何能收那么贵的版面费？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259320]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, an accounting journal in Hubei Province, &quot;Accounting Newsletter&quot;, issued a notice stating that authors who raise families with three children No publishing fee. This was originally a very niche academic journal, and the notice itself could reach a relatively small number of people, but it quickly aroused heated discussion on the Internet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reasons for the heated discussion can be attributed to the following aspects: firstly, the page fee of six to seven thousand yuan for an article is not cheap; secondly, the positioning of this journal, which was led by the Hubei Provincial Accountant Sponsored by the Society and directed by the Hubei Provincial Federation of Social Science and Technology, charging high page fees feels more like a commercial practice; the last is this preferential measure, which is very high-profile, but in fact the number of beneficiaries may be very few and can almost be ignored. , it feels more like a promotion. It’s not surprising that the combination of several factors has made it a hot spot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although I have always known that there is a page fee for publishing papers in academic journals, it is somewhat surprising that the fee for an article is so high. According to its official website, there are 31 articles in the latest issue of the catalog. This journal is published bimonthly. Based on the page fee of 6,000 per article, their monthly income can reach 372,000 yuan, which is 4,464,000 yuan a year. The annual income of a journal is nearly 5 million, which is definitely a good business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the important reasons is that the world has been undergoing a &quot;Great Leap Forward in Higher Education&quot; in recent decades, and the accompanying &quot;paper inflation&quot; behind it. Because China has a large population base and rapid economic development, problems in this area are particularly prominent. It&#39;s just that most of the people involved are &quot;literary people&quot; and are more or less &quot;beneficiaries&quot;. Even if they see the problem, they will not easily pierce this layer of window paper. After all, seeing through but not telling off is also a well-known survival wisdom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind the academic qualification inflation is the expansion of undergraduate, graduate and doctoral students. Major universities attach great importance to the number of papers, and basically require graduate students to publish a corresponding number of papers before graduation. Usually, the better the school, the higher the requirements for the level of papers. Every year, students apply to postpone graduation because they have not completed the publication of their thesis. Thesis publication is a necessity for the research community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, the expansion of undergraduate and graduate enrollment will inevitably be accompanied by an expansion of the number of teachers. Throughout the education system, there is a tradition of assessing the number of published papers. There are rigid regulations that require publication of papers when promoting teachers&#39; professional titles, applying for scientific research projects, or applying for various scientific research funds. And it’s not just universities that require essays, even primary and secondary schools now have requirements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only the education system, but also hospitals and even some units that are not scientific research institutions will use the number of published papers as an important indicator for promotion. One of the considerations is probably because it seems fair. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another consideration is a certain sense of &quot;academic worship&quot;, or &quot;science worship&quot;, as if publishing a paper is making a contribution to scientific scholarship. In fact, for a long time, many places and universities in our country have been pursuing and promoting the &quot;only patents and number of papers theory&quot;. The number of papers and patents has always been the focus of their propaganda. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In early August this year, the research institute of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan released a report. The report shows that China’s total number of papers accounts for 24.6% of the global share, 8.5 percentage points higher than the second-placed United States. In terms of the number of citations used to measure the quality of papers, China’s global proportions of “attention papers” and “top papers” were 28.9% and 29.3% respectively, ranking first in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We don’t need to belittle ourselves and regard this kind of data ranking as worthless. Objectively speaking, on the one hand, this data shows that China’s scientific research and academic influence is gradually expanding, which is a good thing. But on the other hand, we must also see the contrast between this quantity and reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We often say that &quot;quantitative changes lead to qualitative changes&quot;, but when the number of papers and patents is distorted by the wrong incentive system, quantitative changes may not lead to high-quality qualitative changes. On the contrary, it is more likely to lead to low-level, low-level duplication, and also produce some bizarre &quot;academic research.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, a few years ago, an academic journal published &quot;It is expected to improve the efficiency of building a clean government culture by targeting intestinal flora to regulate the body&#39;s material needs and desires.&quot; There are many more articles of this kind, which are completely unabashedly &quot;pseudo-academic&quot; and just to make up for the numbers. Under the improper incentive system, publishing papers has become a necessity for many people, and it is a very large &quot;market&quot;. The demand is strong but the supply is limited. There are only so many publications and so many pages, so it basically forms a &quot;seller&#39;s market&quot;, and it is not surprising that the page fees are high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With high prices and huge profits, more people will definitely participate, so this forms an &quot;essay industry chain.&quot; There are writers, there are agents, there are people who are responsible for paying, and there are people who are responsible for publishing. You can basically find various channels as long as you pay. Of course, this &quot;market&quot; is not completely spontaneous, but is caused by a deformed incentive system. Moreover, under this deformity, corruption is likely to breed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, Wu Dongfeng, the former editor-in-chief of Qiusuo magazine of the Hunan Academy of Social Sciences, was placed under investigation for serious disciplinary violations. The problem lies precisely in the publication fee. Later, the court determined that Wu Dongfeng had charged nearly 10 million yuan in &quot;page fee&quot; for his paper. The &quot;page fee&quot; for publishing an article in &quot;Qiusuo&quot; magazine can reach up to more than 50,000 yuan, and there are intermediaries responsible for blending these matters. At that time, this case caused great shock in the academic community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to such corruption cases and problems, the &quot;paper industry&quot; has another problem, and that is the &quot;siphon effect.&quot; People in this &quot;industrial chain&quot; were supposed to create wealth, but instead they became &quot;paper brokers&quot;, helping others publish worthless articles to make profits. And some page fees are reimbursed at public expense. Except for those articles that are truly valuable, I am afraid that most of the junk articles are essentially &quot;conspiring to divide the spoils&quot; among many people. Some of them may be dividing taxpayers&#39; money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you want to change the status quo, I am afraid it is not a headache for the doctor. Not to ask why the page fee is so high, but to ask why so many worthless journals and articles can still live so well. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 13:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[那些在互联网买“情绪”的年轻人，拜托醒醒吧]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259422]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/27/a7605c3b1df672a8ea3cc792da571f45.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;957&quot; height=&quot;637&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/10/27/a7605c3b1df672a8ea3cc792da571f45.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255732&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo / picture）&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many people may have heard the melody of &quot;love trading&quot;, but they don&#39;t know that there is also a business of &quot;emotional trading&quot; now. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;Emotional Tree Hole&quot;, &quot;Good Luck Spray&quot;, &quot;Scolding to Awaken Love Brain&quot;, &quot;Virtual Mosquito&quot;, &quot;Einstein&#39;s Brain&quot;... Nowadays, many young people are keen on As for purchasing emotional products online, there are more and more emotional products that can be purchased for just a few dollars. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;For example, when you have an emotional breakdown, you can buy a chat service online, talk to strangers, complain a few words, and your negative emotions seem to be released; place an order for a &quot;Virtual Mosquito&quot; , there will be sellers role-playing who will &quot;buzz&quot; you from time to time; after breaking up, buy a copy of &quot;Scolding to Awaken Your Love Brain&quot;, and strangers will be your &quot;chat partners&quot; and treat you rationally and rationally. Move with emotion...&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Why are young people so keen on buying emotions on the Internet? Can buying emotions really provide emotional value? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Young people are “emo” &lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Behind the purchasing emotions are the emotions of many young people Emotion has encountered some &quot;problems&quot;. To use a popular word nowadays, it is &quot;emo&quot;. Emo was selected as the Internet Word of the Year in 2021. In this year alone, Bilibili users sent &quot;emo&quot; barrages 3.3 million times. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;emo&quot; comes from the English word &quot;emotion&quot;, which means emotion. In the 1990s, &quot;emotional hardcore&quot; appeared in the field of European and American pop music, which is a kind of rock music with delicate emotions, melancholy and sentimentality. After being simplified to &quot;emo&quot;, emo also has colors such as impulsiveness, sensitivity, and melancholy. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Emo, which is now a popular vocabulary, continues this core and emotional color, representing the decadent, frustrated, speechless and puzzled mood of young people. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Emo has become a popular word not only because of the principle of &quot;language economics&quot; - this short word accurately summarizes the mentality of young people, and it is not just popular. The &quot;herding effect&quot; in the spread of vocabulary - you use it for other people and I use it for you. What&#39;s more, emo is indeed a universal emotion of the times. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Emo is a new variant of the previously popular words such as &quot;Buddhist&quot;, &quot;mourning&quot; and &quot;lying flat&quot;. It is related to some new changes of the times. For example, in the post-epidemic era, the global economy is recovering slowly and the economic downturn has put young people under greater work pressure. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many people feel very tired under the &quot;involution&quot;; in the busy urban life, many young people do not have much time to socialize and stay in rental houses after work Here, they will inevitably feel lonely and cold as &quot;empty-nest youths&quot;... In addition to these universal dilemmas, young people also have different and specific confusions in their own lives, which more or less affect their emotions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In short, young people can emo about everything. I can&#39;t find a job, I&#39;m emo; I&#39;m under great pressure at work, I&#39;m emo; I have a conflict with my partner, I&#39;m emo; I&#39;m single and have no partner, I&#39;m emo; I&#39;m not ready for the exam, I&#39;m emo; my plan was rejected by Party A, I&#39;m emo...&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Compared with words such as mourning and lying down, emo has a hint of self-deprecation of joy in suffering. It is not so negative and pessimistic, but after complaining about &quot;I am really emo&quot; , will still clean up the mess of life and move on. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;The comfort of &quot;emotional value&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After emo, you still have to embrace life. Therefore, young people will work hard to calm down their emotions faster and satisfy their emotional needs. They will seek &quot;emotional value.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;So, what is emotional value? Simply put, emotional value = positive emotion (benefit) - negative emotion (cost). &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Whether a thing or a person has emotional value lies in its ability to bring positive emotional power to people, such as making people feel happy, secure, calm, and warm. , healing... In other words, emotional value is the ability to have a positive impact on our emotions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It can be companionship, sharing, listening, encouragement... In the end, it becomes a kind of comfort for emo emotions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On social media, young people also often use words closely related to emotional value, such as &quot;emotional stability&quot;, which has become the first criterion for many young people to choose a partner. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;An emotionally stable partner can always handle things calmly and calmly, without losing control, without blaming each other, and without blaming each other, but working hard to solve problems. A partner who is emotionally stable will naturally bring strong emotional value to others - you will be wrapped in a sense of security, and no matter how chaotic the world is, there will be someone walking hand in hand with you. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;With this background, we can understand why many young people buy emotions on the Internet. What they essentially buy is &quot;emotional value.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;If a person has no motivation to study, just join the &quot;virtual study room&quot;, and everyone will study together to have more atmosphere; if you want an illusion of good luck, buy &quot;Good &quot;Yuck Koi&quot;; if you want to get rid of loneliness and gain a sense of companionship, you can place an order for &quot;Virtual Mosquito&quot;, where a seller will role-play a mosquito and &quot;buzz&quot; you from time to time; buy it after a breakup A &quot;scolding to wake up your love brain&quot; is not so much about scolding you as it is about accompanying you, talking to you, and listening to you. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/27/66f81e258e4ce4cd84843e25edeb22f7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;794&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/27/66f81e258e4ce4cd84843e25edeb22f7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255731 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo / picture）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Not want to buy Just buy it&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It is human nature that people like people and things that can provide high emotional value. Keen merchants have also seized this business opportunity - young people need emotional value, and I will sell emotional value. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The question is, can you really buy emotional value if you want to? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;If emotional value was such an easy thing to obtain, it wouldn’t be so scarce. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As mentioned above, emotional value is a kind of &quot;ability&quot;. It must really hit your emo point, bring you strength, comfort and help you. You transcend that depression. This is not something you can achieve by typing in a dialog box and the other party saying a few words of chicken soup for the soul; it is not something you can achieve by buying a &quot;Good Luck Koi&quot; or &quot;Einstein&#39;s Brain&quot; and you will be blessed with divine help. Falling from the sky; it’s not the other party “inciting emotions”, you will be emotionally liberated...&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;So, those &quot;sell&quot; products on the Internet for a few cents or a few dollars &quot;Emotion&quot; is just a gimmick. The sellers do not have the quality and ability to provide emotional value. They are even more routine and perfunctory than the customer service of some merchants. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;What young people buy is only a few minutes of freshness, which brings a few minutes of fun to the emo mood. Once the freshness is over, the emo is still the emo, and the problem has not been solved. If so, it&#39;s still not resolved. It&#39;s OK to think of &quot;emotional trading&quot; as a joke, but if you take it seriously, you may be deceived and make you more emo. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the final analysis, if there is no one or thing to rely on, then the only one who can bring positive emotional value to yourself is yourself. If you haven&#39;t studied for a long time and feel that you have fallen, you will feel emo, and you think that joining the &quot;virtual study room&quot; will give you motivation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In fact, such heteronomy is in vain. If you have more self-discipline and complete the goals you set every day, you will feel real happiness the moment you complete it - the better. Self-discipline brings freedom; if you don’t work hard at ordinary times, you will feel emo before the exam. You think buying a &quot;good luck koi&quot; will bring you good luck, but you still won’t during the exam. If you study hard and concentrate on preparing for the exam, you will Your hard work will be reflected in the exam, and what you gain is a real sense of solidity and accomplishment...&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After all, the value of emotions cannot be bought just because you want to buy them. Buying emotions is a pleasure. Yes, but getting out of emo cannot rely solely on spiritual victory. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color: orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https: //feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[《芭蕾舞复仇曲》：韩影越来越套路]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259234]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;Among the new generation of Korean actresses, all Zhong Rui is an alternative existence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She made her fortune in Li Cangdong&#39;s &quot;Burning&quot;.

Furthermore, Chef Cui, who looks vicious on the surface, is just a small leader of a gang organization, and behind this is a huge black industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/3b9fa39ae346614fe6e4adea29bae5a6.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;585&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/3b9fa39ae346614fe6e4adea29bae5a6.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255249&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src =&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/9588ac4b4e3c43c214228f05c4f44c86.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;581&quot; data-src=&quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/9588ac4b4e3c43c214228f05c4f44c86.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255252&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This setting in &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot; comes from The &quot;Room N&quot; case caused a lot of controversy in South Korea in the past few years. The prisoner in the case, Zhao Zhubin, established a paid &quot;room&quot; on an online platform and used the threatened girls as bargaining chips to profit from it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s just that this film introduces gangster forces and makes sexual crimes bottomless, in order to amplify this despair and anger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some time ago, &quot;The Voice of Freedom&quot;, which was adapted from real events, brought to the table the rarely mentioned child abduction and sex trafficking. Although the quality of the film is not good, its discussion of this topic is worthy of recognition. It allows us to see a criminal phenomenon that is deep underground and widespread. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Back in &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot;, as Yuzhu deepens her investigation into Chef Cui and the organization behind him, she also only avenges her best friend at the beginning, but gradually transforms into avenging the victimized woman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/268593f73416414dfafc55f5eebe2d6a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/268593f73416414dfafc55f5eebe2d6a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255251&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thus, The killing scenes and action scenes have become the second highlight of this film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, Jeon Jong-seo cannot rely on physical confrontation and impact to create visual stimulation like Stallone and Jason Statham, nor can he use real kung fu techniques like Jet Li and Donnie Yen. Show off a pleasing figure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The action design of &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot; absorbs the style of the &quot;John Wick&quot; series, that is, it gives full play to the advantages of &quot;gun-shaped&quot; action movies, allowing hot weapons and fists and kicks to be used alternately. Ammunition can create explosive scenes, and the head-on confrontation of fists, feet, knives and axes can highlight the thrilling effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/49c05f887c4da2835039b1202d553252.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;447&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/49c05f887c4da2835039b1202d553252.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255253&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is at the climax In the scene, Yuzhu used two pistols to fight against the entire gang, which was most obvious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this alone cannot make up for Jeon Jong-seo&#39;s complement in action scenes, so lens language and editing techniques have become necessary auxiliary means. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The quick swinging technique, the movement of the camera synchronized with the direction of the punch, and the extensive use of close-up and close-up shots, coupled with the fast and sharp editing style, make the entire movie have a clear rhythm every time it enters the action section. Accelerate and the atmosphere becomes wanton and arrogant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/f93216844dc743bab519ed1dbdda4762.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;449&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/f93216844dc743bab519ed1dbdda4762.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255254&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, the director Li Chongxian is familiar with action films such as Hong Kong&#39;s &quot;The Fuse&quot;, Indonesia&#39;s &quot;The Raid&quot; and South Korea&#39;s &quot;Crime City&quot;, so he can create these action scenes with ease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the tilted and unbalanced camera images and the neon aesthetics with great color contrast make &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot; closer to the style of Hollywood crime films in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/78b1fd2e8b7e5919d612333b29603ec0.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;448&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/78b1fd2e8b7e5919d612333b29603ec0.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255256&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In general In other words, the crime theme of exploiting women&#39;s bodies, good fighting scenes, and Jeon Jong-seo&#39;s character arc that is sometimes conservative and restrained, sometimes sensitive and angry, make this film have a sense of entertainment that is above the pass mark. However, when we finish watching &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot;, we can still detect its frivolity and frivolity based on big data algorithms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the character Ok-joo&#39;s emotions continue to deepen in the process of revenge, this delicate inner change relies more on Jeon Jong-seo&#39;s outstanding performance. Why did she become a bodyguard? Why are you so depressed in life? The film never explains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/49aca55250b8bad1121f2886af777652.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/49aca55250b8bad1121f2886af777652.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255255&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for her being Min Xi is infected and her heart gradually melts, but it is like going through the motions, and the filming is stereotyped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most puzzling thing is the pretentiousness of the underworld gang, which is strong on the outside but capable on the inside. The boss, who is full of gangster traditions, did not see anything done after he lectured Chef Cui. He neither saw through Chef Cui’s lies nor demonstrated his strategizing of the organization. Only in the contrasting section of &quot;die from talking too much&quot; does it play a role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/290aa6cfac3b8cb644611e61892284ca.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;446&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/290aa6cfac3b8cb644611e61892284ca.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255257&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thus, &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot; provides a framework for female revenge, especially in terms of revenge for best friends. It is exactly the same as the summer hit &quot;The Vanishing She&quot;. But when it comes to the specific levels of criminal psychology, social ecology, etc., it seems to be discouraged. It is not like Luo Hongzhen&#39;s &quot;Yellow Sea&quot;, which separates the dirty, angry and restless characters&#39; psychology and shows you in detail. Instead, it provides a visual pleasure for immediate consumption and caters to the public&#39;s emotional fast food. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the inevitable result of Netflix and other streaming media entering the Korean market. It has brought big data arithmetic and more routine formulas, and this may also become a trend in the next few years. , a signal of an overall decline in the quality of Korean films. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[深圳欢乐谷过山车追尾，有游客称前一天已遇故障]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259498]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 10:19:37&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot;Snowy Eagle&quot; project promotion picture.

Her test result was mild. Concussion, bruises and skin injuries on hands and feet. She recalled to the Southern Weekend reporter that she didn’t know exactly what happened at the time of the incident. “I just felt that my car was sliding backwards, and finally I realized that it had hit the previous car that was discharging passengers.”&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;At 23:25, Shenzhen Happy Valley officially issued a situation report stating that the injured have been sent to the hospital for treatment and are in stable condition with no life-threatening injuries. &quot;The cause of the incident is under investigation.

We didn&#39;t know what happened at first What happened? I found out later that it was a car crash.&quot; Zhao Xin, a student who was lining up at the scene, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhao Xin said that several students from Shenzhen Huitong School were on the roller coaster where the accident occurred. “Several of them went up to play together. One of them had some stomach injuries because he didn’t have time to get off, and the other one It’s more serious and I passed out.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At about 23:00 on the 27th, a Southern Weekend reporter called the customer service of the University of Hong Kong Shenzhen Hospital. A staff member on the line said he was unclear about the situation, but said that the current queue time in the emergency department would be It&#39;s very long. &quot;There are more people waiting in the emergency department now.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the official website of Shenzhen Happy Valley, &quot;Snowy Eagle&quot; has a five-star thrill level. It is a catapult roller coaster built with a huge investment of 200 million and is the tallest and longest catapult roller coaster in Asia, with a total length of 550 meters. &quot;Speed ​​up in 2 seconds, galloping at 135 kilometers per hour, falling vertically from 60 meters, heart-poundingly crazy for 90 seconds, 4G maximum acceleration, the experience of going to the sky, going to the ground, and going into the sea is thrilling to the end.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This is It is a relatively popular event, and there were a lot of people queuing up today.&quot; Zhao Xin recalled that she had been queuing for nearly two hours. If nothing had happened, it would have been her turn to get on the next bus. Finally, she left around 19:00 At the scene, &quot;When my friend went over to play, he found that the project had been closed.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 26, the day before the incident, Chen Yuangang played &quot;Snow Land&quot; with his friends. Eagle&quot; project. She told Southern Weekend reporters that there was a problem with the system at that time: &quot;The Snow Eagle made a loud sound when it ejected, but I didn&#39;t hear it at the time, and then I found that the car had returned to the starting position. After a while, , the roller coaster ejected again, and returned to the starting position after a normal run.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Yuan recalled that the vehicle system activated the emergency protection device at that time, and tourists on the roller coaster were unable to get off. &quot;The staff used the microphone to inform the remaining people in line that there was a problem with the system and needed to be repaired, so they could not continue playing. They also issued speed passes to the remaining people in line.&quot; Chen Yuan said that everyone stayed on the stalled roller coaster again. After about ten minutes, the staff adjusted and the emergency braking mode was released and we were able to get out of the car. &quot;About two hours after the emergency repairs, Happy Valley notified Snow Eagle to resume operations.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Maintenance is done every day&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Public information shows that Shenzhen Happy Valley has been open since 1998 and is a new generation of large-scale theme park of OCT Group.

Its vehicle structure includes two trains (orange car and green car), each train has 6 carriages, and each carriage can accommodate 4 people. There are 24 people in the whole car and 48 people in the two cars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, a rear-end collision involving an aerial sightseeing train occurred in Happy Valley. On November 1, 2018, while two &quot;Happy Main Line&quot; sightseeing trains were running over the Overseas Chinese Town tourist resort, the front train stopped due to a system failure, causing a slight rear-end collision with the rear train. There were about 20 passengers on the two trains, causing 2 People get hurt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to information from the China Bidding and Bidding Public Service Platform, on March 21, 2023, Shenzhen OCT Happy Valley Tourism Company issued a bidding announcement for the overhaul service project of the Shenzhen Happy Valley Snowy Eagle Project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bidding announcement shows that the overhaul service project of Shenzhen Happy Valley&#39;s &quot;Snowy Eagle&quot; project includes professional evaluation of the overall operation situation, carrying out Snowy Eagle&#39;s service status evaluation, safety and reliability evaluation, large-scale Repairs, condition monitoring systems and other work will be carried out, and it will pass statutory inspections, regulatory filings, etc. The planned construction period is from April 20, 2023 to June 30, 2023.

The notice specifically mentioned that Chen Guifen &quot;violated regulations in accepting gifts and arrangements for beauty activities.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, expressions such as &quot;accepting beauty activities&quot; and &quot;addicted to beauty&quot; have appeared many times in official review reports on dismissed female officials. Chen Guifen&#39;s defeat this time has further brought the new term &quot;beauty corruption&quot; to the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called &quot;beauty corruption&quot; refers to cases of corruption and bribery that occur due to accepting beauty activities. Among the typical cases reported in recent years, the high amount of money involved and the bizarre corruption projects of &quot;beauty corruption&quot; have been breathtaking. The former director of the Anshan Municipal Taxation Bureau Liu Guangming’s “500,000 butt plastic surgery fee”, the latter the former mayor of Manzhouli City Xu Ailian’s “150,000 yuan for a beauty needle”, and the former vice president of North China University of Technology Shen Zhili’s “single consumption of 690,000 yuan” &quot;An astonishing number. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to infer from the term &quot;cosmetic corruption&quot; that certain types of corruption are indeed related to gender. Due to the different preferences of men and women, it is not difficult to understand that bribers will cater to them in a targeted manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;willfulness&quot; of power will find an outlet, just like life, to satisfy the individual desires of those who abuse power. Cash and real estate, gold and silver jewelry, luxury cars and watches, antique calligraphy and paintings, there is always something suitable for fallen officials, which is also a common feature of corruption among male and female officials. However, the difference in preferences between male and female officials in the form of corruption is also a visible phenomenon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early years, the ostentatious culture of men showing off their success also had an impact on the officialdom. There were many incidents where people were arrested for corruption based on photos. In view of this, in recent years, the corruption of male officials has mostly been &quot;low-key&quot; and &quot;hidden&quot;, which is the &quot;lesson&quot; learned from certain &quot;cousins&quot; and &quot;brothers&quot; who were dismissed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, in terms of forms of corruption, the &quot;indirect&quot; and &quot;confusing&quot; characteristics of male officials are becoming more and more obvious, such as &quot;setting up offshore accounts&quot;, &quot;accepting bribes after retirement&quot;, &quot;shadow companies&quot;, &quot;option corruption&quot;, etc. There are endless means. The ancient &quot;elegant bribery&quot; has not completely gone into history. The high-end bribery and acceptance of bribes with the help of antique calligraphy and painting are still common in the corruption details of fallen male officials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, male officials are also trying to hide their wealth and keep a low profile. They are no longer easily caught because of their public image as usual. Regarding the details of corruption, male officials also try their best to cover up and leave no traceable information, such as the &quot;$300,000 gift box&quot; codenamed &quot;Little Seafood&quot; received by Sun Lijun, and Zhang Qi, former member of the Standing Committee of the Hainan Provincial Party Committee and former Secretary of the Haikou Municipal Party Committee. The secret method of &quot;filling the home with 13.5 tons of gold bars&quot;. Male officials can often use their special interests and hobbies to satisfy their greed while hiding the fact of corruption: Yang Hongwei, former deputy secretary of the party group and deputy director of the Chongqing Municipal Administration for Market Regulation, is known as the &quot;ball secretary&quot; and is keen on playing basketball during working hours. , using playing ball to cover up his corrupt behavior of giving and receiving privately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to see that playing ball and other hobbies are more common among men. Judging from some female officials who have been dismissed in recent years, corruption that combines power and the love of beauty is not uncommon. From accessories, clothing and bags to luxury goods consumption, to the so-called &quot;beauty corruption&quot;. Just like the corruption record of Bai Hong, the former chairman of the labor union of the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau, &quot;the praise and jealousy of the people around him made Bai Hong immersed in the pleasure of a successful woman.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For bribers to pay for beauty treatments on their behalf, or to give high-priced beauty salon membership cards, this can constitute bribery of female officials, and even the development of novel money laundering methods. In real life, it is not uncommon for &quot;ordinary people to pay exorbitant prices for beauty treatments.&quot; However, once a female official&#39;s love for beauty is empowered by her desire for power, the resulting corruption will become even more like a torrential flood. &quot;Power keeps people young forever&quot; is not only a symbolic statement for female officials, but also a realistic statement that can be realized with the help of beauty consumption. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not just officials who are corrupt. People in key positions can still be corrupt, and corruption tends to be younger. Young people tend to be bolder and more reckless in their corruption. Zhang Yujie, a &quot;post-1995&quot; clerk at the Chuzhou Real Estate Registration Center, embezzled nearly 70 million yuan in public funds, tens of thousands of which were spent on game cards. After the incident, this card was auctioned for more than 80 million yuan. His hobby is playing games. In the 2016 &quot;Accounting Corruption Case of Four Young Women in Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province&quot;, Bai Ling, the former cash accountant of the Gaoyou Municipal Agricultural Committee, misappropriated 10.51 million yuan in public funds, of which more than 8 million yuan was used for beauty consumption. At the time of the case, she was only 29 Years old, it is really shocking to embezzle such a huge amount of money just for beauty consumption. Their preference is to love beauty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 34 of the &quot;Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China on Administrative Punishment for Public Officials&quot; stipulates that &quot;those who accept or provide arrangements for banquets, travel, fitness, entertainment and other activities that may affect the fair exercise of public power will be given a warning, A demerit or a major demerit will be recorded, and if the circumstances are serious, the person will be demoted or dismissed.&quot; Beauty corruption, in terms of form, is a relatively hidden &quot;entertainment and other activities&quot;, and the amount involved is often in compliance with the &quot;Applicable Laws on Handling Criminal Cases of Corruption and Bribery&quot; of the two high authorities. The &quot;extremely huge amount&quot; standard in &quot;Explanation of Certain Issues&quot; can be called hidden corruption in the gray area. Therefore, to combat beauty corruption, we need to start from the source of corruption and curb the room for arbitrary power. This point is gender-neutral. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 10:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国家数据局揭牌，年内落马中管干部达39人丨时政周报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259490]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/27/26cYbymIzOStR24cc3LlYF4O4UW02DgWUpAEzt6F.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;617&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/27/26cYbymIzOStR24cc3LlYF4O4UW0 2DgWUpAEzt6F. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255790&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 25, 2023, the National Data Administration was officially launched. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(People&#39;s Vision/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After more than seven months of preparation, on the morning of October 25, 2023, a group of members of the preparatory team Witnessed by representatives from other ministries and commissions, the National Data Agency was officially unveiled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So far, the two newly established departments in the ninth institutional reform of the State Council have been completed.
