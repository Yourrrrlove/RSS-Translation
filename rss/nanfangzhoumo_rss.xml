That year, when the lease of my studio in Wangjing came to an end, I tried to find a house in the alleys of the old city, thinking that this would be closer to the nobility and wealth of the city and would be conducive to new development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/NyevBw1waDLo7t2WNXaMdLMLJsSEndluWYr07jat.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/NyevBw1waDLo7t2WNXaMdLMLJsSEndluWYr07jat.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252404&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Vendors chatting at the door of the Gongmenkou wet market&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Fan/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Correct In the middle of summer, I wear NB993 running shoes that are unchanging in all seasons. Because of Steve Jobs, this pair of shoes has a symbolic meaning for me that goes beyond practicality. I bought three pairs in one go and rotate them around. With the blessing of shoes, the scorching sun and showers are no longer unbearable, and the road to dreaming in a foreign land becomes easier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I first went to Houhai and Huguo Temple, then searched Dongzhimen and Dongsi. After several twists and turns, I came to Baita Temple and finally found a suitable house. The agent and the landlord have agreed on the price, and I want to go back and think about it before making a decision. As soon as I turned around and hadn&#39;t gone far, the landlord suddenly came out and stopped me, saying that the old man at home wanted to chat again. It turns out that my uncle accidentally heard me talk about his hometown, where he was sent to work as a teacher when he was young. The uncle&#39;s expression reflected the special meaning of that experience to him. I saw in his eyes a trace of sadness at meeting an old friend in a foreign land. The old man took me and asked me in detail about the current situation in my hometown, big and small, and took the trouble. Because of this unexpected fate, the house was settled quickly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps, the place where a person first starts will give life a background and determine certain choices in life. Some passes cannot be forcibly reversed by manpower alone, and trying to do so is mostly in vain; but if you let nature take its course and take things as they come, you can see the bright future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this way, my fate with the White Tower began, and the White Tower in my heart gradually became clear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/jEn7Z0GY4C23HpNmcwD6YDqlDfw3Kaj5egrhQCDq.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/jEn7Z0GY4C23HpNmcwD6YDqlDfw3Kaj5egrhQCDq.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252405&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Gongmenkou Hutong under renovation&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Fan/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many times , I walked around the tower alone. I try to slow down and move forward with a calm and quiet mentality. It seems that it is easier to meet happiness this way. However, as time goes by, wrinkles creep up to the corners of the eyes, and white hair grows on the head. The happiness in the longing for is like a bird perching on the treetops. It seems to be close at hand, but it spreads its wings and slips away. Between movement and stillness, the tall and pure white tower always stared at me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The studio is on the second floor, and the windows face the White Tower. When the sun rises, it covers the window sill with gold; when the sun sets low, it casts the shadow of leaves on the screen window. There is a statue of Venus with a broken arm in the house. According to the uncle, it was left by a tenant painter from the Academy of Arts and Crafts. The statue and the white tower often appear in the same picture, with light and shadow flowing between them, chanting the changes of the four seasons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/6NdsISkOezbywy1NFtuk6TR9j6tOavRRu9rtt8LO.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/6NdsISkOezbywy1NFtuk6TR9j6tOavRRu9rtt8LO.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252403&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The Golden Dome of the White Tower under the winter sunset&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Fan/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/5dSDq00pAPdQZpEhhpiok1M8MxLyyb0yKUCvEC5d.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot; //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/5dSDq00pAPdQZpEhhpiok1M8MxLyyb0yKUCvEC5d.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252406&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Pigeons flying around the tower&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Fan/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is windy in spring. When the wind blows, the alley is no longer filled with yellow sand and dust, but the gentle airflow makes pedestrians hurry. Spring brings hope, and people want to do something quickly, maybe they can seize a chance and fly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is rainy in summer. Unlike the continuous drizzle in the south, even in the rainy season here, the rain is cheerful and warm, and stops in a flash. Sometimes while walking, a sudden rain shower occurs. The huge raindrops make the leaves rustle and the roof tiles crackle. Pedestrians start running in panic, looking for shelter from the rain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Autumn is so nice. Only in autumn does her beauty fully show here. Every alley, every doorway, balcony, and both sides of the door are filled with various flowers and plants, embellishing a colorful picture against the blue sky. Perhaps only Mr. Lao She&#39;s &quot;Autumn in Peiping&quot; can fully explain that scene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Winter is another scene. A heavy snowfall seems to bring time back a hundred years ago. It is difficult to distinguish north, south, east and west in the vast whiteness, but you can vaguely see the Beiping where masters gather. People stayed behind closed doors, but I ran into the wind and snow to capture this time-traveled black and white world with my camera. After the snow, the ice subsided, Lu Xun’s home turned back into his memorial hall, and I returned to reality, under the White Tower in Beijing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/T3moYVA9HC1x8ARXk9h7C6nvofjUhGIKDPF7LT9Q.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/T3moYVA9HC1x8ARXk9h7C6nvofjUhGIKDPF7LT9Q.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252407&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Residences shaded by vines and green plants&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Fan/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/14Fkgiv03oPupBxYvfvRmNzScD7CZPGKsD0zSdW9.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;/ /images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/14Fkgiv03oPupBxYvfvRmNzScD7CZPGKsD0zSdW9.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252409&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center ;&quot;>;The dog taking a nap in summer&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Fan/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I still remember the Xuji Shaobing Shop in Anping Alley. Big, every morning the aroma of burning pasta wafts out, and people come here to queue up to wait for the sesame seed cakes to be baked. The small tables and chairs at the door are always full of diners, and the crowd is buzzing. The crispy sesame seed cakes paired with a bowl of fragrant bean soup is a delicious treat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Master Bao at the entrance of the palace is always crowded. The Xingyuan Restaurant opposite is a time-honored state-owned restaurant, and the food is quite affordable. Walking west along Fuchengmen Inner Street, you will find Xinchuan Cold Noodles near Fuchengmen Subway Station. In the summer, a big bowl of it, paired with a bottle of ice-cold Arctic Ocean, is so refreshing. There is also a shop selling salted duck eggs downstairs from the studio. The supply is rationed every day, and each one peeled out is full of red oil. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/MpHQqXlXcavItT0RBSUSyhmc4sTUy7jzEVt8E7er.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/MpHQqXlXcavItT0RBSUSyhmc4sTUy7jzEVt8E7er.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252401&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Uncle drying birds under the warm winter sun&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Fan/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/LdvXPQc344shLwXqCY1sMvQQRuQmYmGOwk3chv83.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot; //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/LdvXPQc344shLwXqCY1sMvQQRuQmYmGOwk3chv83.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252412&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On a summer night, people enjoy the cool air while playing with their mobile phones&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Fan/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The alleys around Baita Temple The name is both vivid and interesting.

Some netizens carefully prepared their favorite snacks, such as kisses, konjac jelly, etc. as wedding candies, but were criticized as being too bad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don’t know when it started, but the &quot;happy&quot; wedding candy headed towards the involution track. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, China&#39;s wedding candy market is in close conflict with each other and the two factions are divided. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One group is companies focusing on the wedding candy field, such as Aidoduo, etc.; the other group is traditional candy companies, such as Dove, Hsu Fuji, etc. Companies focusing on wedding candy focus on customization and packaging, while traditional candy companies focus on nationality and cost-effectiveness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the weddings of grandparents in the past, which were mainly fruit candies and milk candies with simple packaging, high-end wedding candies are now the choice of contemporary couples. For example, they will choose Godiva chocolate for 5 yuan a piece.

Currently, there are more than 22,000 happy shops across the country. The happy shop culture is prevalent in the south, accounting for 60% of the country&#39;s total, while in the north, happy candy is customary. In terms of purchasing from candy wholesale markets, hypermarkets, and online, Xipu still needs to be developed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind the crowds of weddings are the &quot;red bombs&quot; that have been bombing one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data show that the average income per person in Shanghai, Zhejiang and other places is 1,000 yuan, while the average income per person in Guangdong, which has always been just about getting lucky, is only 100 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One side is spending thousands of gold on gifts, and the other side is spending tens of thousands of dollars on a wedding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, nearly 90% of Chinese couples will spend more than 50,000 yuan on their wedding, and 0.4% of couples will even spend more than 500,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, personalized weddings, such as &quot;material sorrow&quot; weddings and carbon-neutral weddings, have also become new choices for young people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, &quot;Know&quot; will talk to you about the sweet worries of weddings about wedding candies and share money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/03/831b80df1d8aa019cd150056d5435eb1.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;853&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/03/831b80df1d8aa019cd150056d5435eb1.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252950&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/03/95c2f4acac0bd5d935b7e41ee70742e4.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width =&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;1200&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/03/95c2f4acac0bd5d935b7e41ee70742e4.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252951&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/03/1f28cfb09adb79f1b577f5f6dbc2fe7e.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot; 900&quot; height=&quot;1200&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/03/1f28cfb09adb79f1b577f5f6dbc2fe7e.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252952&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/03/6899c96a2a3cc79f52ab82a571ba38d0.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;1200&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/03/6899c96a2a3cc79f52ab82a571ba38d0.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252953&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/03/f9209ae4d2f9444cf823fcddca744dce.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height= &quot;1200&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/03/f9209ae4d2f9444cf823fcddca744dce.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252954&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src =&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/03/a841ff40895bd7c611637dac01109292.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;1200 &quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/03/a841ff40895bd7c611637dac01109292.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252955&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot; https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/03/d58a01e5fbb6bb084b06423bea502775.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;1200&quot; data -src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/03/d58a01e5fbb6bb084b06423bea502775.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252956&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 03 Oct 2023 14:55:13 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“成年人的奶嘴儿”：人人索要的“情绪价值”究竟是个啥？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258008]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-03 13:09:44&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The &quot;Li Jiaqi tells you to work hard&quot; incident that made a lot of noise some time ago has provided netizens with entertainment and conversation topics after dinner.

It is also an expected result that they are pushed into the whirlpool of public opinion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that &quot;emotional value&quot; is not only the key element for Li Jiaqi from the clouds of the business empire to the center of the whirlpool of public opinion, but also the root of the survival of the &quot;cyber peddler&quot; profession in modern society. In fact, this concept has already surpassed the live broadcast e-commerce industry and has spread in all fields of this society. We should talk about &quot;emotional value&quot; in the workplace, &quot;emotional value&quot; in love, and even in family life. Let’s talk about “emotional value”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what is this &quot;emotional value&quot; that everyone wants and is more important than the commodity itself in commodity trading activities? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The spiritual pacifier of the adult world&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Contrary to the intuitive impression of most people, emotional value (Emotional Value), a term that looks very much like a psychological term, is actually a complete term. The marketing concept itself refers to the difference between emotional benefits and emotional costs in the marketing process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To put it simply, in a shopping trip, regardless of whether the transaction is finally concluded, as long as the positive emotional experience provided by the seller to the consumer is greater than the negative experience, the consumer will obtain positive emotional value. This is a right Favorable results for the seller. On the contrary, if consumers gain negative emotional value, it will be an unfavorable result for the seller. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the sales industry, emotional value theory is often used to design and optimize sales processes, guide sales staff training, provide customers with a better consumption experience, and convert and fix potential customers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, as mentioned above, in today&#39;s society, both the concept of &quot;emotional value&quot; and the theory of emotional value itself have been greatly abused. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In almost all fields of social and interpersonal communication, people’s demand for “emotional value” is becoming more and more urgent and intense. On a popular social APP, you can see everywhere that the emotional value requested is not as good as expected. Various complaints are raised: the boss cannot provide emotional value, colleagues cannot provide emotional value, love/marriage partners cannot provide emotional value, parents cannot provide emotional value, and even strangers who occasionally meet cannot provide emotional value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here, &quot;emotional value&quot; has changed from a marketing concept to an ability, an ability to use language to make people feel &quot;comfortable&quot;. Regardless of whether this language is the result of rational thinking, or whether its rhetoric is consistent with objective facts, as long as it can make people feel &quot;comfortable&quot;, it has the ability to &quot;provide emotional value.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People who are accustomed to asking for &quot;emotional value&quot; from others in life have a common characteristic, which is that regardless of whether they have this ability, they must require the other party to have this ability. While refusing to give in in public life, he complains that others cannot provide enough emotional value. This kind of mentality that is both strong and fragile, and wants to take but is unwilling to give, has formed one flammable and explosive tinderbox after another in social and public life, which can explode anytime and anywhere the moment they lose their pacifier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, it is an obvious fact that in modern society, while information technology and communication technology connect individuals more and more closely, the continuous disintegration of communities also makes individuals become more and more independent. Alone, people end up becoming what Hannah Arendt called &quot;atomized individuals&quot; - they may be very closely packed but at the same time isolated from each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of &quot;noisy loneliness&quot; makes atomized individuals usually place material enjoyment in a very high position in order to alleviate and comfort the spiritual loneliness. Correspondingly, this kind of individual is psychologically lonely. Vulnerability also drives them to endlessly ask for the so-called &quot;emotional value&quot; from the outside world. Therefore, the overwhelming emotional value in modern society has long since changed from a marketing concept to a spiritual pacifier in the adult world. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;A paradise of clever lies&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Just like in the business empire built by &quot;Cyber ​​Merchant&quot; with &quot;family members&quot; and &quot;queens&quot;, the emotional value is more important than the product itself. The &quot;emotional value&quot; that pervades other areas of society also exceeds reason, logic and objective facts themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, in the discussion of public affairs, the rhetoric of &quot;putting aside the facts, isn&#39;t XXX wrong?&quot; that can be seen everywhere is an excellent example of this kind of mentality, completely regardless of objective facts. Regardless of whether there is a problem with your own thinking logic (or no logic at all), as long as the other party makes you feel subjectively uncomfortable, it means that you have not provided &quot;emotional value&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When an individual regards &quot;emotional value&quot; as the highest goal of social life, excessive and excessive emotional pursuit will inevitably consume and destroy their ability to think and express based on reason and logic. . The so-called &quot;thinking&quot; has become an animal conditioned reflex of &quot;if there is no pacifier, I will make a fuss&quot;. The so-called &quot;expressions&quot; are all the catharsis of accumulated emotions, and people cannot have any meaningful discussions, because all fact-based discussions will deviate from their original track and end in a hysterical mess. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A society full of such individuals must be a kindergarten composed of &quot;children aged 6 years and 256 months&quot; where &quot;everyone is fragile and needs to be coaxed&quot;, and it will naturally become a place where all kinds of clever words and tricks are Liars are at home in this paradise of lies. For some people, the sweet-talking online opposite sex in the &quot;Pig Killing Plate&quot; can obviously provide higher &quot;emotional value&quot; than the &quot;low emotional intelligence&quot; partner in reality. For the elderly, the health product sellers who hang around them every day and talk about &quot;Mom and Dad&quot; obviously provide more &quot;emotional value&quot; than their own children who come back once a month and become impatient with a few words. Ultimately, a society where &quot;there is always someone to trick you&quot; will inevitably become a society where &quot;there is always a liar that suits you&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ability to regulate one&#39;s own emotions is the basic ability of adults living in modern society. It is normal for people&#39;s emotions to fluctuate under the influence of others, but if an adult&#39;s emotions are completely provided and controlled by others , then he can only be an adult in the physiological sense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The process of social modernization is irreversible. Problems such as individual atomization, mental loneliness and vulnerability, and psychological immaturity that arise in the process of social modernization cannot be solved by reconstructing the pre-modern society where &quot;chickens and dogs hear each other&quot; solve. The ultimate solution to the problems caused by modernization is modernization itself. From the perspective of &quot;emotional value&quot;, we see a &quot;crisis of modernity&quot; that needs to be faced squarely and urgently resolved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 03 Oct 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“陪拍”爆红，出租自己的工具人生意也火了]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257709]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-03 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 03 Oct 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[专访谢飞：“如果内容都讲不清楚， 这个时代的电影就不会有光彩”丨影视大咖谈⑤]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257483]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-03 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/ 12/02/8mcJrhvBnwWykQYR6Cw86h5eBS1MXcd12I1qZ9R6.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;630&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/12/02/8mcJrhvBnwWykQYR6Cw86h5 eBS1MXcd12I1qZ9R6. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;173882&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On February 22, 1993, &quot;The Fragrant Soul Girl&quot; directed by Xie Fei and Li &quot;The Wedding Banquet&quot; directed by An jointly won the Golden Bear Award at the 43rd Berlin International Film Festival. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xie Fei spends a lot of time in film festivals of all sizes every year. After the epidemic, he can only When participating in the film festival in China, he thought that the directors of his generation were nearly eighty years old and had not participated in social activities for many years. He asked the film festival: Can some old filmmakers be invited? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This group of &quot;senior moviegoers&quot; has become a unique sight at the 2021 First Youth Film Festival and Pingyao Film Festival. Xie Fei and his classmates were mostly film graduates in the 1960s and are representatives of China&#39;s fourth generation of directors. They call the beautiful years of making movies the &quot;Age of Innocence&quot;. Xie Fei explained, &quot;When we were filming the first and second movies, we were very young, even naive, but we had something sincere in it.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;Today, most of their lives have nothing to do with movies. 79-year-old Xie Fei is busy sorting out his parents&#39; information during their lifetimes. A few years ago, he published family letters for his father and is now sorting out his diaries. His goal is to complete them all before the age of 85, otherwise &quot;if you are confused and unable to do it in the future, you will regret it.&quot; Others praised him for his good health and that he should continue to make movies, but he disagreed. In addition to movies, there are many important things in life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He publishes film reviews on Douban every now and then, and is known as &quot;the biggest film critic.&quot; His vision of watching movies is very broad, and he has to check out the latest movies, popular online dramas, and even popular animations. The Japanese science fiction anime &quot;Evangelion: The Movie: Finale&quot; has a Douban score of 9.2. Before watching this movie, Xie Fei deliberately made up for its more than 20 years of animation history, but he still felt &quot;confused. Can’t understand”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2021, the Pingyao Film Festival replayed his 2000 work &quot;Yixi Dolma&quot;. Xie Fei marked the film as &quot;seen&quot; on Douban. Netizens replied below: Have you not only seen it? &quot;Yeshe Dolma&quot; uses the life story of a Tibetan woman to reflect the changes in Tibet over half a century. Several Tibetan actors who were in their early twenties are now in their forties. Xie Fei invited them from Lhasa. They said that Lhasa is different now and more modern. Reviewing old works, Xie Fei was objective and confident: &quot;Although this movie has many shortcomings, it is not outdated.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xie Fei&#39;s film career began after the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;. He shot nine movies, &quot; &quot;Best Year&quot; and &quot;Scented Soul Girl&quot; won the Silver Bear Award and Golden Bear Award at the Berlin International Film Festival. It was the prime year for Chinese-language films to emerge in the international film industry. In 1993, the Golden Bear Award was unexpectedly awarded with a &quot;double yolk egg&quot;. Xie Fei&#39;s &quot;Scented Soul Girl&quot; and Ang Lee&#39;s &quot;The Wedding Banquet&quot; won at the same time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After &quot;Yixi Dolma&quot;, 58-year-old Xie Fei announced that he would no longer make movies. He filmed two TV series. Later, in 2003, he was infected with SARS and was classified as a seriously ill patient in the hospital. After recovering, Xie Fei stopped filming completely and devoted himself entirely to teaching at the Beijing Film Academy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xie Fei admires his 83-year-old old classmate Ding Yinnan the most. He is good at making biopics such as &quot;Sun Yat-sen&quot; and &quot;Zhou Enlai&quot;. In 2015, he co-directed his latest work with his son. &quot;He still has a lot of plans, so he won&#39;t stop. His physical condition is very good now. As long as his son is with him, he can take pictures until he is 90 years old.&quot; Xie Fei said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The representatives of American new Hollywood movies are about the same age as China’s fourth-generation directors. Martin Scorsese and Xie Fei are the same age, and they continue to create films at a rate of two to three years. Xie Fei wrote in a Douban film review, &quot;Envy, jealousy, but not hate. Everyone has his own destiny.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;On November 1, 2021, Xie Fei accepted an exclusive interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend in the office of Beijing Film Academy. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;“You are not a real director if you don’t make three movies in a row”&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What is the experience of veteran directors participating in the film festival this time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;We old comrades are very interested in watching the first and second movies made by these children in the digital age, including the later I have reviewed the award-winning films &quot;The Last Farewell&quot; and &quot;A Man&#39;s Funeral&quot; on Douban, and there are also some more traditional and solid films. And we found that such a folk film festival is doing very important work in supporting the growth of a new generation of young people. It was a very difficult process from graduating from undergraduate to graduate, shooting one or two short films, and then to making feature films. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, we were all in the era of planned economy. The biggest difference between us, apart from the difference between film and digital, was that we were assigned to traditional national studios after graduation. There will definitely be tasks in it. We will act as assistant directors and scene recorders, and let you direct independently when you have certain abilities. And the country will require: This movie is for comedy and to make money; that movie is about kung fu, you have to do it even if you don’t like it; this movie is something you can explore freely and consciously on your own. So at that time, we had better conditions for growth than young directors today. After graduation, many of us would become independent after working as assistant directors for five or eight years. After independence, everyone made one movie a year and two movies a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the studio at that time, if you had something you wanted to shoot What about movies? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;First of all, you have to fight for the right to shoot. For example, like the now famous director Li Shaohong, she was assigned to Beijing Film Studio after graduation. I was Xie Tieli&#39;s assistant director and worked as many assistant directors. But her first film must be one that makes money. So she made her first movie called &quot;Silver Snake Murder&quot;, which was a thriller and did well at the box office. After that, the factory believed in her, because a girl had made a good film independently, and she made the second film she wanted to make, called &quot;Bloody Morning&quot;, which is based on the Latin American fantasy novel &quot;A Pre-publicized Story&quot;. Adapted from &quot;Homicide&quot;. She transplanted it to rural China, and the final shot was wonderful. In the planned economic system, you also have to look for your opportunities. For example, director Ning Ying came back from studying in Italy. She has her own school of thought. However, her first film at the Beijing Film Studio was a romantic comedy called &quot;Someone Prefers to Fall in Love with Me&quot;. Then she could make &quot;Have Fun&quot; - an art film that she really wanted to make and that had won many awards. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this era, we see that digital technology has lowered the threshold for photography. As long as you have the desire for expression and talent, you can sometimes shoot what you like, and it is very formal. Innovative films and we greatly appreciate their creativity. But after these people make this film, if there is no market in the future, no one will invest in them, and many people will not be able to take on the second film. And directing is a practical art, especially when you are around thirty years old. If you don&#39;t make three movies in a row, you are not a real director. You only have one movie, you haven’t had a creative team for several years, and you have less experience. I have met many directors at First. They made a beautiful movie and won various awards, but after three to five years, they never made another movie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Are many young directors short-lived? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;A lot. This is also (because) as freelancers now, in a commercial market-dominated situation, he must stubbornly only want to shoot his own things. He is not adapted to, does not know how to, and does not take the initiative to engage in entertainment and popular styles. Go and learn. Li Shaohong and Ning Ying, who I just talked about, have to force themselves to study well how to shoot entertainment films, comedies, and thrillers, and they will do well. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the current film ecosystem, what new directors face Are funding issues more difficult than they were then? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It was not very difficult at the time. &quot;Black Horse&quot; found many people in Hong Kong to contribute money, which was actually only more than one million yuan. Because the market is small, we don’t need to invest so much. We don’t have any special technology or equipment, and they are all quite cheap. The most expensive one was the filming of &quot;Yeshe Dolma&quot;. By 1999, the filming was completed for 4.5 million. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now it depends on the director. If you want hundreds of millions or tens of millions, of course it will be difficult. The key is that the producer only dares to invest if he thinks he can make money back. How much is invested and how much is recovered is the job of the producer, not the director. The director&#39;s job is to be artistically complete. If the producer thinks that your story and actors can only make 30 million at the box office, then your investment cannot exceed 10 million. However, whether this estimate is correct or not is the producer&#39;s job. Now it is wrong to say that everything is the responsibility of the director all day long. Movies are a comprehensive art, and the director did not say that he would definitely earn 100 million. If you insist that you can earn 100 million, if you invest lavishly, if you dare to shoot with 100 million, then the protagonist will not give up until he earns several million. Some of them are very unprofitable. You should blame the producer, not the director. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was filming &quot;Yeshe Dolma&quot;, when I started looking for money, I also thought that maybe using a star would make this movie better. I approached Gong Li, and Gong Li&#39;s producer said after watching it one day, who should she play in this drama? At first when I was in my twenties, and later when I was in my seventies, I couldn&#39;t rely on anyone and felt like I couldn&#39;t act. Later I discovered that this was impossible. One was that the original taste of Tibet was lost. I saw another group of actors in Lhasa, including old actors in their seventies and actors in their twenties, and they were suitable. It’s effortless. You were originally a subject of art films and suddenly wanted to enter the commercial market. This was a miscalculation. Fortunately for me, I didn&#39;t. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;“Chinese films must be passed down from one generation to the next to have a bright future”&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italic, italic _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What old movies did you screen at the film festival? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Ding Yinnan’s &quot;Zhou Enlai&quot; was filmed in 1992, and it is now thirty years old. I very much hope that modern young audiences and The creators took a look at how our fourth generation represented the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; and a great man like Zhou Enlai in the early 1990s, and how we reproduced China&#39;s reality and history. All of us old people rewatched &quot;Zhou Enlai&quot; together with the young people. It was all shot in real locations, because at that time, Deng Yingchao said that he wanted to shoot in the Prime Minister&#39;s original house, as long as you think it&#39;s artistically acceptable. Therefore, even the clothes and shoes worn by Zhou Enlai and the handkerchief he put in his pocket every day are real. The ward of Hospital 305 where Zhou Enlai was seriously ill was also the same. The restoration of the external texture is very wonderful. So today&#39;s young people, how do you use your methods to truly express and record the real life in China? This is your responsibility. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Back then, it was a mission for these directors to make movies with the main theme ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It’s not a task, it’s their request. No movie is made to commemorate any festival. Because the education they have received since childhood is the education of revolutionary history, they feel that these are important great men. I personally think that the main theme is also the same. The key is how you shoot it and whether you respect the audience. Many reviews of some movies today just count the stars, not the historical figures of that time at all. What is very important is that the most sensational TV series this year was &quot;The Age of Awakening&quot;. I was very excited to watch it. It was very good. It reaffirmed the achievements of Li Dazhao and Chen Duxiu, and it was also presented in a more artistic way. Further down, &quot;Mountains and Seas&quot;, a TV series about poverty alleviation, starts from the trail and writes about a village very vividly. I think if the main melody is made according to the rules of art, it may be done well and the audience will like it. The audience may also be disgusted by competing for stars and scenes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you think of screening and watching these old movies today? What is the meaning? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>; Our generation is still alive now, so if you can speak, speak as soon as possible. Next year I think I will hire the fifth generation if it doesn’t work out. Except for Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige, most of the fifth generation are no longer on the front line, and they haven’t filmed in a few years. Most of them are my students. Tian Zhuangzhuang is still filming. Recently, a film has not been cut out. Wu Ziniu has not filmed much anymore. In addition, Wang Jixing who filmed &quot;Jiao Yulu&quot; and Huang Jianxin have been doing it. Ye Daying filmed &quot;Jiao Yulu&quot; back then. &quot;Red Cherry&quot; was very sensational, and Mi Jiashan also filmed &quot;The Unruly Lord&quot;. If these films are taken out and watched today, young people will find them very vivid, and they never expected that they were so beautiful and had such pioneering consciousness and ideas. I personally feel that we need to understand the benefits of these works and the reasons of the times why they were produced. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chinese films must be passed down from generation to generation in order to have a bright future. For example, people of our generation watched the third generation and the second generation. The earliest ones include &quot;Street Angel&quot;, &quot;Cross Street&quot; and &quot;A River of Spring Flows East&quot;. The best tradition in the early days of Chinese films is realism, and family ethics dramas are particularly good. . Family ethics are placed in the context of the great times. You think of &quot;A River of Spring Flows East&quot;, which expresses the great times through family ethics and has become a Chinese movie classic. In the third generation, &quot;Furong Town&quot; directed by Xie Jin is also about the moral and ethical changes of the family. Therefore, the type of family ethics is something that has been very successful in Chinese film realism. We must inherit it now. We cannot simply reject it and think that family ethics is tacky and the love between children is not grand. Another example is the second and third generation of Chinese films. They created kung fu films based on Chinese martial arts. From &quot;Burning the Red Lotus Temple&quot; to &quot;Shaolin Temple&quot; and &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; they have conquered the world. We young people can’t help but be interested, and we can’t understand that whether it’s an artistic film or a commercial film, it must be passed down. We don’t require everyone to cover everything, but we hope that there will be an inheritance as a whole. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is the issue of inheritance? First of all, you need to watch movies that you have never seen and have forgotten. Your mind is filled with foreign things, especially some popular foreign movies. For example, in the Chinese theater industry, Western musicals have been praised over the years. I have seen it on Broadway several times. It is very popular, but it is very short and is far behind our operas. The opera actors have better kung fu than them. Much stronger. There are obviously such good operas in China, but they don&#39;t inherit or develop them. Instead, they just insist on reviving musicals in China. They have been doing it for 30 or 40 years. Do you think there is a mature one? Is there one that is loved by the wider music audience? Chinese film and television also have this problem. I watched Japan&#39;s &quot;Neon Evangelion&quot; the other day. I really didn&#39;t understand how great it was, including the recent &quot;Dune&quot;. This is the culture of foreigners, and they have had it for decades. If we Chinese are chasing these things to the death, you will never be able to make something that represents Chinese quality. When making movies in China, you have to learn things from the fourth generation, and even a lot of things from the third and second generations. You have only heard of &quot;Spring in a Small Town&quot;. You need to take a closer look at why &quot;Spring in a Small Town&quot; is rated so highly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What traditions of the fourth generation do you think are still relevant to today’s young filmmakers? Lost it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think what is very important is social thinking and cultural thinking. I think one of the biggest characteristics of the 1980s is that after &quot;Practice is the Only Criterion for Testing Truth&quot;, it caused the whole society to reflect on the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;. Scar literature and scar movies were produced on the basis of reflection, and later, root-seeking appeared. In literature, we have to look for the reason and our bad nature from two thousand years of feudal culture, so many movies are adapted from these novels. The greatest advantage of our time was that our thoughts and creations advanced side by side and encouraged each other. The stagnation of thought can easily lead to the author&#39;s self-restraint, and the author has no choice but to write some self-expression of small favors, small grudges, and small disputes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/12/02/qEXM00Mnot1TgNA20aj93BJgsFbicHy87XI74aMt.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/12/02/qEXM00Mnot1TgNA20aj93BJgsFbicHy87XI74aMt.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;173877&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Xie Fei (left) and Jia Zhangke at the press conference of &quot;The Black Horse&quot; at the 3rd Pingyao International Film Festival on October 14, 2019. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;“Many movies that are considered classics in China have not been seen by Westerners. to”&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why the fourth generation of movies seems to have less impact on young people Is it as big as the fifth generation? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I have a doctoral student who is a foreign girl. Her topic is the recommendation of Chinese films by the three major Western film festivals. In the Western world, film festivals have a strong value-added function. As long as this work is selected by a major film festival and enters the main competition, it will immediately rise to a level. If it wins the grand prize, many critics will want to see it, and in the end, it may become famous in historical circles. Consider it a classic. Before the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, Chinese films were basically not produced in the West. &quot;Red Sorghum&quot; won the Golden Bear Award in Berlin in 1988. This was considered the first breakthrough. Zhang Yimou suddenly became famous all over the world, and then &quot;Qiu Ju&#39;s Lawsuit&quot; in 1992 &quot; and &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; in 1993. In the same year, all three major film festivals (awards) were won by Chinese films. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reputation of the fourth generation of directors is not as good as them, because they have continuity. Zhang Yimou later had a series of films that won awards at three major film festivals, as did Chen Kaige before and after, and they appeared in the theoretical circles The title of &quot;fifth generation&quot; was adopted, and the previous generations were deduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a student, I have read a lot of information about the three major film festivals. The third, fourth, and fifth generation films in the new era are all recognized by Westerners, but by some strange combination of circumstances, they all think they are fifth-generation films. generation. Xie Jin&#39;s &quot;Furong Town&quot; was wanted in Cannes after it was filmed in 1986. However, it was not given and was given to the Karlovy Vary Film Festival in the Czech Republic. If he had gone to Cannes at that time, he might have won the award in 1986, and the third generation would have become extremely popular. Without the award, the West didn&#39;t talk much about the overall review. In fact, in the later retrospectives, the West highly praised &quot;Stage Sisters&quot; directed by Xie Jin and thought it was a very good director. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a textbook used by many universities in the United States called &quot;Understanding Movies&quot;. It was published in the early 1980s. Every time it is reprinted, new movies will be added. There are now fourteen editions. There is only one movie from China, &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot;. Other Asian films, such as several films by Japan&#39;s Akira Kurosawa and even older films by Rai from India, were considered classics by Westerners, and their reputation soared. As for Chinese films, the three major film festivals have made Westerners aware of some Chinese films. The final conclusion of this study is that Western films have a one-sided understanding of Chinese films. Many films that are considered classics in China have not been seen by Westerners, do not know about them, and have not been evaluated. We Chinese think it is good, but some of them do not recognize it due to political reasons. For example, they don&#39;t watch these main theme works directed by Ding Yinnan, but actually ask us to watch them. They are already very good, not much worse than their &quot;General Patton&quot;, but there are political barriers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is also a very clear example. The Sixth Generation was not screened in China at the beginning, but Jia Zhangke became famous all over the world. When he was probably less than fifty years old, he was awarded Lifetime Achievement Awards by several international film festivals. I heard at that time that &quot;Three Gorges&quot; is the Chinese film that has sold the largest number of films to all five continents and countries around the world, because from a humanistic perspective, Westerners think that the great migration of millions of people is a huge human social phenomenon, and this film is very Artistically expressing this change, they believe that Jia Zhangke&#39;s film is a thirty-year history of social changes in China&#39;s counties, and has very strong cognitive value. Then it was released (in China) and the box office was also very low. I remember that when &quot;The Good Man from Three Gorges&quot; was being performed, Zhang Yimou&#39;s &quot;A City of Gold&quot; was released. Jia Zhangke said sadly that no matter how good a good man is, he can&#39;t compare to gold. Jia Zhangke has organized various festivals and schools in China, and is also a deputy to the National People&#39;s Congress, so his status is quite high. But if you really ask the general audience, very few people have seen his movies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So in the fourth generation or even the third generation, many people have not had the opportunity to go out to some of our good works back then. Some, like mine, have gone out, but people have the impression that you are one of the fifth generation. So we often tell these doctoral students that in fact, from the 1980s to the early 1990s, the glory of Chinese films in the world was jointly created by three, four, and five generations. Another thing is to see that foreign opinions have their correctness and limitations. They are curious. For example, if you praise the correctness of the light, they will not be interested. But when they enter social reality and criticize reality, they are particularly interested. interest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Did you care more about the recognition of foreign film festivals in the past than now? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>; It has always been the case until today, but now I don’t take it so seriously. It seems that there was a news last year and this year that one of the three major festivals is a Chinese film None, unfortunately. After 2007 and 2008, Chinese films also entered the main competition, but they were very scattered. There are some that have won awards, such as &quot;Fireworks in the Day&quot; and &quot;Tuya&#39;s Marriage&quot;, but these films themselves are not particularly well received in China. Unlike at that time, &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; is still the most highly rated Chinese film on Douban now, so you can&#39;t say that the masses are influenced by foreign film festivals, and it itself is genuine. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/12/02/mFbNH1GMGKoFxmapTeecAQAZX2Q5CVZ0qbxQUp2E.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;750&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/12/02/mFbNH1GMGKoFxmapTeecAQAZX2Q5CVZ0qbxQUp2E.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;173887&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Xie Fei and Jiang Wen on the set of &quot;Ben Ming Nian&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&quot;The complexity of human nature is not captured in the photo. The Chinese people in the future will also see I don’t understand”&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After participating in domestic film festivals, what do you think of the current youth What is the overall level of filmmakers? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After I came back from Pingyao and First, I wrote a Douban article, mainly to comment on several award-winning films. In fact, I feel that the form is greater than the content, and I work hard on the form, but the content and even the basic plot narration are not up to standard. This is a bad thing, because content is the core. If the content is not explained clearly, the explanation will be even less weighty, and the movies of this era will not have brilliance. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Many of your films are adapted from literary works , now many young directors like to write their own scripts, what do you think? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;One is that many people do not read novels or read literature, and their literary foundation is poor. There are still some good works by writers who are still active in China. You have to be patient and read them. Every year, for example, the Mao Dun Literary Award awards countless novels. Not long ago, a TV series called &quot;Zhuangtai&quot; came out, which was very successful. This author also wrote a TV series called &quot;Zhuangtai&quot;. &quot;Protagonist&quot; is also very good, and it seems that it will be adapted into a film and television work. No matter whether it is a full-length novel or a medium-length novel, there is still an author who is writing things seriously. If we directors can pay attention and read more, we will find that there are many things that are more important than the stories we come up with and are worthy of your expression. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another one is that he is self-satisfied and thinks that he can write screenplays. After finishing writing good screenwriters, he has already started directing. Why should I make wedding dresses for others? We over-praise directors. In TV dramas all over the world, screenwriters are king. Indeed, screenwriters play the biggest and fundamental role. For example, South Korea respects screenwriters very much, and even three directors take turns filming, so no episode will be the same, and the quality of the show will not be lost. We are not here now. Many people say that except for a few high-IQ creatives, the film crew is all migrant workers. There are no technical secondary schools, junior colleges, or blue-collar schools for the grassroots production staff, and their cultural and technical abilities cannot be cultivated. Some film and television teachings talk all day long about whether they can cultivate a little swallow or a Zhang Yimou, as if this is the school&#39;s credit, which is wrong. You should be comprehensively trained, because film and television production and media-integrated audio-visual production are very vast and require a large number of technical talents and talents of all levels. You have to respect them, including those who make clothes, design hair accessories, and make them, all of which require skills and culture. Therefore, farmers in a village can provide lighting for Chinese TVs. This is a phenomenon that is not seen in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Where do you think the best movies of the moment will appear? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I don’t know because I have seen very little. One is for ourselves to affirm, and the other is for the international community to affirm. I have repeatedly made a point that what foreigners cannot understand today will not be understood by Chinese young people in the next two or three generations. Don&#39;t think that you can understand him because he is Chinese, because he has left today&#39;s society. For example, they will think, why don&#39;t they go to the city in the countryside? Some people say they have household registration and food stamps, and they ask, what are those? Foreigners today can&#39;t understand it because they don&#39;t understand it. If your movie is just a matter of fact and fails to capture the complexity of human nature, they won&#39;t be able to understand it. Chinese people in the future won&#39;t be able to understand it either. If you insist that he understand what China&#39;s planned economy is all about, why should he understand it? People used to often say, Xie Fei, if your movie is applauded by foreigners but not by Chinese, you are not considered a success. I said, just wait and see. Two or three generations later, if the Chinese still praise my film, they will not be able to understand the film you praise. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 03 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[仙雾缭绕梵净山丨指尖华夏⑤]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257587]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-03 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>; Fanjing Mountain in Tongren City, Guizhou Province is sometimes shrouded in clouds and mist, with cascading mountains and greenery, just like a fairyland on earth, attracting many tourists.

From 2011 to 2018, Wu Wei took advantage of various opportunities to go to Beijing to send cash to his daughter. Each time, he sent hundreds of thousands of yuan in cash. Wu Wei sent nearly 20 million yuan in cash to her again and again in the past eight years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people wonder: The Civil Air Defense Office seems to have no sense of existence. How could the person in charge embezzle so much money? Let&#39;s put it this way, basically everything below the ground is under the control of the Civil Air Defense Office, so there is a lot of space for renting and rent-seeking. When developers build buildings and build underground garages, they stipulate how much area must be used for civil air defense projects. After completion, they must pass the completion acceptance of the civil air defense project construction project. In order to pass the inspection and acceptance, the equipment and materials used in the civil air defense basement often have to purchase designated products, and the so-called deposit or security deposit is actually the &quot;relocation construction fee of the civil air defense project.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, many people in charge of the Civil Air Defense Office have been dismissed. For example, in September 2023, Liang Fangsheng, director of the Fangchenggang City Civil Air Defense Office, was subject to review and investigation; in July, Xue Shibang, the former director of the Jiuquan City Civil Air Defense Office, was &quot;suspected of serious violations of disciplines and laws&quot; and was subject to review and investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Back to the Wu Wei case, this person put cash in his bag instead of transferring money, which shows that he has a strong awareness of money laundering and anti-money laundering. Transferring money will leave an indelible record. Cash is much more concealed; giving cash to your daughter shows that you love your daughter very much, that you are a &quot;daughter slave&quot;, and that you corrupt your family and your daughter. Taken together, it shows that he is a thoughtful person and a &quot;loving&quot; father. It’s just that the agency’s calculations were too smart. Once the incident happened, it was impossible for the investigators to ignore the whereabouts of the money. If my daughter suddenly had a large amount of cash in her hand, there had to be a reasonable source, right? There is no getting around the question of whether it is money earned legally by oneself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, everyone&#39;s discussion of this case naturally extended to the question of whether Wu Wei&#39;s daughter was guilty or not. Logically speaking, doesn&#39;t he have an idea of ​​how much legal income his father has? My father gave himself hundreds of thousands every time, only in cash and not in bank accounts. Ten thousand yuan in cash with a face value of one hundred yuan is 115 grams, and half a million yuan is more than ten kilograms. From Harbin to Beijing, it is more than a thousand kilometers. My father worked so hard, saying I didn’t know that the money given by my father was not legal, which seemed a little unreasonable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Assuming that Wu Wei’s daughter is not guilty, there is still a problem of parents committing crimes and failing their children. Some netizens believe that at least the children of corrupt officials should be deprived of the right to take public exams. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a long time, there has been a saying on the Internet that &quot;one person&#39;s crime affects his children&#39;s public examination.&quot; In fact, according to the express law, there is no provision that children whose parents commit crimes do not have the right to take public exams. Article 19 of the 2019 &quot;Civil Service Recruitment Regulations&quot; issued by the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China stipulates that individuals who have &quot;received criminal punishment for crimes&quot; are not allowed to apply for civil servants. There is no provision that children whose parents have committed crimes are not allowed to apply for or be hired as civil servants. There is an &quot;inspection&quot; after passing the public examination ( Also known as the &quot;political examination&quot;), there is no provision for children whose parents commit crimes to fail the examination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, this is just a general situation. If you apply for secret-related positions or public security, judicial and judicial positions, there will be a substantial &quot;political review&quot; and it will be relatively strict. Take applying for a police job as an example. Article 9 of the 2020 &quot;Political Investigation Work Measures for the Recruitment of People&#39;s Police by Public Security Organs&quot; stipulates: If the family member of the inspection target has one of several circumstances, he or she shall not be determined as a candidate for recruitment, including intentional homicide, intentional injury causing serious injury, or Death, rape, robbery, drug trafficking, arson, explosion, release of dangerous substances and other serious crimes with a negative social impact, or corruption and bribery involving huge amounts and serious circumstances, subject to criminal punishment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, if the parents have committed vicious crimes or been criminally punished for corruption, their children will not be able to pass the political review when applying for the police examination. Therefore, judging from the express provisions, the special conditions for the establishment of &quot;parents&#39; crimes affecting their children&#39;s public examinations&quot; are: it is limited to certain sensitive and key positions, and it does not mean that parents who commit any crime will be affected by their children; general public offices are not affected, and generally speaking, &quot;parents&quot; It is not true that crime affects children&#39;s public exams. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that according to the current law, even if the children of corrupt officials who have been sentenced to actual imprisonment are unable to apply for certain positions or fail the political review, they can still apply for general public offices. But there is indeed a legal and ethical issue here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Modern society is based on individuals enjoying their rights and taking their own responsibilities. In principle, children should not be implicated because of their parents&#39; crimes or any other faults. This is indeed good. However, the premise for this to be true is that the children do not enjoy the proceeds of their parents’ crimes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The situation is different if the child knows or constructively knows of the parent&#39;s criminal conduct and benefits from it. After telecom fraudsters defraud money, they will build a big house for their families and provide their children with the best education and living conditions. It can even be said that the original intention of some telecom fraudsters is to let their children and family live a good life. The children and family members also know that the money came from shady sources but still enjoy it without shame. What’s the problem if they are somehow implicated? On the one hand, a thief cannot just eat meat without being beaten, and on the other hand, it also serves as a deterrent to telecom fraudsters themselves, weakening their motives and incentives for committing fraud. Rather than sympathizing with the children of these implicated telecom fraudsters, everyone should sympathize more with Xu Yuyu. Xu Yuyu, a girl from a poor family, was defrauded of 9,900 yuan in tuition fees just after she was admitted to university, and she died in depression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similarly, if the children of convicted embezzlers know or are presumed to know that their parents’ money came from shady sources, and can accept it calmly and remain calm, even if they are not guilty, they cannot be called innocent, and they are restricted from taking public exams. What&#39;s the problem? Public offices are funded by taxpayers and should have higher moral requirements than ordinary people. Everyone should know that enjoying the proceeds of a family member&#39;s crime is at least immoral. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 03 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[王者归来叶诗文：“我可能还会有下一个巅峰”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258042]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-03 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/02/XEPQLTWFg1khdX7tCM5PueYqe9Sw7ngyMAmFisFg.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;624&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/02/XEPQLTWFg1khdX7tCM5PueYqe9Sw7ngyMAmFis Fg. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252945&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 31, 2012, in London, England, Chinese athlete Ye Shiwen competed in the women&#39;s 200m mixed Won the gold medal in the swimming final and set an Olympic record &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The spotlight once again hit her, the former genius girl , stood on the podium again. On September 25, Ye Shiwen won the silver medal in the women&#39;s 200m medley at the Hangzhou Asian Games. On September 28, Ye Shiwen won the women&#39;s 200-meter breaststroke gold medal at the Hangzhou Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reporter asked her during the post-match interview, &quot;Do you think you are at the peak of your career now?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I used to think that 2012 was my peak, but now I think I will reach the next peak.&quot; Ye Shiwen replied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2012, 16-year-old Ye Shiwen won the women&#39;s 200m and 400m individual medley double championships at the London Olympics, which became the pinnacle of her career. Just two years ago at the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games, Ye Shiwen had already won the gold medals in these two categories. Most of the news headlines at the time called it &quot;the birth of a genius girl.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After winning, the next lesson that cannot be escaped is &quot;how to face losing&quot;. This is the sweet cruelty of becoming a champion. In the summer when she was 25 years old, Ye Shiwen stayed in Hangzhou, the venue for the Asian Games today. At that time, Tokyo, which was 2,000 kilometers away in a straight line, was the venue that she failed to reach. She missed out on the Tokyo Olympics by a hair&#39;s breadth in the trials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was a long &quot;losing&quot; and a battle with oneself. When being interviewed when preparing for the Asian Games in 2022, Ye Shiwen&#39;s feelings contained some feelings of &quot;ending a full stop&quot;: She is from If you start learning swimming in Hangzhou, you should end it here, like some kind of fate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Until he won another championship in the Hangzhou Asian Games, Ye Shiwen gave his answer with &quot;There will be a next peak.&quot; This is a continuation, not an end. Time has helped this professional athlete establish a more comprehensive answer. Swimming is no longer the only thing she loves, but swimming is still her favorite thing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/02/AuiWoJleFDyfrUU3AztmsSb69bwYaX35tjsvnFwN.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;646&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/02/AuiWoJleFDyfrUU3AztmsSb69bwYaX35tjsvnFwN.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252946&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 28, 2023, in the women&#39;s 200-meter breaststroke final of the Hangzhou Asian Games swimming event, Chinese player Ye Shiwen won the championship with a time of 2 minutes, 23.84 seconds&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/02/8cCb2a70EVVyXymEwS8EToBJ2jnXps4tm7rrrcpV .jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;681&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/02/8cCb2a70EVVyXymEwS8EToBJ2jnXps4tm7rrrcpV.jpg&quot; data-key =&quot;252947&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;September 25, 2023, Chinese players Yu Yiting (right) and Ye Shiwen (left) After the women&#39;s 200m individual medley final.

&lt;p>;This is the first time in Ye Shiwen’s career that she splashed water to celebrate after a game. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;28日晚，叶诗文在杭州亚运会女子200米蛙泳项目上夺冠，这是她自2014年仁川亚运会夺得3枚金牌后，时隔9年再次登上亚运之巅。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;女子200米蛙泳是叶诗文此次杭州亚运会重点备战的项目。在前50米落后的情况下，她持续加速超越对手，后程逐渐把领先优势扩大到一个身位，以领先第二名2秒47的明显优势夺冠。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“一直以来，我非常想要再次站上最高领奖台。这次在家门口做到了，我很激动。”叶诗文在赛后接受采访时称，这是自己第一次到边后拍水庆祝。这种激动的心情，并不仅仅来源于突破外部的纪录，也是战胜自我后的喜悦。叶诗文说，成绩和预想还是有一些差距，接下来要在冬训打下扎实基础，“希望自己能被选上(参加巴黎奥运会) 。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从纪录来看这位职业运动员的巅峰，目前为止无疑是伦敦奥运会。 16岁的叶诗文在女子400米个人混合泳决赛中，以4分28秒43的成绩夺冠，打破世界纪录。随后她又在女子200米个人混合泳决赛中再次为中国队拿到一枚金牌，并改写奥运会纪录。两场比赛，叶诗文都是在最后的自由泳阶段以远超其他选手的速度完成逆转，最终夺冠。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;叶诗文的主项是200米混合泳和400米混合泳。在游泳项目中，400混是公认的最苦最累的项目之一。泳坛名将菲尔普斯也说过，400米混合泳是最难的项目，需要大量训练，它挑战的是人类的身体机能极限。它将四种泳姿的百米冲刺加在一起，速度、体能、经验、心智都是其中不可或缺的因素。菲尔普斯曾感叹，“在这项比赛中，你无法躲藏。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在400混的四种泳姿中，叶诗文的蝶泳和仰泳相对较弱，而这正是400混中的前两种泳姿。通常来看，叶诗文会在前半程落后，后半程反超。 “最后50米”是叶诗文的制胜局，这对她的心态提出了更高的要求，完成逆转需要更强大的心力。天赋、体能、经验，往往有着随时间而变化的客观呈现，而心力更多是一种主观的素质，是运动员自我的较量与追逐。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/02/KndJaDyOTqKhFmOTvZCKgVULDuOX09HGmWUWHYA4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/02/KndJaDyOTqKhFmOTvZCKgVULDuOX09HGmWUWHYA4.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;属于叶诗文的自我较量，在巅峰之后真正开始。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为中国泳坛第一个“大满贯”得主，从2010年开始参加的前11次国内外200米个人混合泳比赛，叶诗文保持全胜纪录，其中包括广州亚运会、上海世锦赛、伦敦奥运会。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;伦敦奥运会后，2013年的巴塞罗那世界游泳锦标赛女子200米个人混合泳比赛叶诗文排名第4，400米个人混合泳项目则排名第7，均无缘奖牌。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2014年仁川亚运会叶诗文摘金，此后是更加漫长的“输”：2015年喀山世锦赛，她在200米混合泳中仅获得第8，400米上止步预赛；一年后的里约奥运会，她在这两个项目上的成绩同样不理想；2017年在布达佩斯，她甚至未能进入决赛……&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“天才少女横空出世”的背后，是冠军光环，也是对“输”的恐惧。在依靠反超逆转的赛道中，这种恐惧似乎更加难以战胜。多年后，再次谈起关于“输”的经历，叶诗文曾向《人物》记者回忆起当年的心态：“我确实给了自己很大的压力。前面一被对手拉开了，就开始紧张，觉得不行，一定要比她们快。但一到仰泳，我的意志力就开始动摇。想到后面还要靠自由泳追那么远，我就没办法坚持了，一下子就崩了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;成绩不好，状态不好，叶诗文选择了沉淀，去清华大学学习深造。那段时间，她没有放弃游泳，“我感觉自己在游泳上没有走到尽头，如果就这样放弃，那我之后人生的每一个困难可能都跨不过去了，所以我还是想回到泳池。”叶诗文曾在采访中回忆。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;回到泳池，重新出发。 2019年光州世锦赛，叶诗文在200米、400米混合泳上均拿下银牌，在200米蛙泳上获得第4名。但在2020年东京奥运会前的选拔赛中，叶诗文以0.01秒之差没能入选。退役成了外部世界的自然联想。曾经站上巅峰的天才少女受到身体发育、年龄增长、伤病缠身等问题的困扰，而这些困扰都指向一个未知的成绩。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但叶诗文的世界里，没有闪躲。亚运会前，为争取参加在“家门口”举办的杭州亚运会，已经一年没有进行水上训练的叶诗文选择第二次复出。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/02/BE7M99fPQDUrpKuUv6ghHfB5pweiTqriXrjnCAiO.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年9月25日，杭州亚运会游泳项目女子200米个人混合泳决赛，中国选手叶诗文以2分10秒34的成绩获得亚军&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（新华社/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;真正的竞技场&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;杭州亚运会前的世锦赛，叶诗文的成绩并不理想，但她没有选择离开赛道，尽管第一次复出以成绩不理想告终。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;备战2020东京奥运会的3年中，叶诗文选择休学，全身心投入训练。没有一个人支持她，因为运动员是一个注定要结束的身份，更何况她曾经获得过一个职业运动员所有的荣耀。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“你疯了！就是霍苏也不可能一辈子游下去啊？”朋友和家人怕她复出是出于好胜心和赌气。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我是不甘心。但我休学不是因为哪个对手，而是想要战胜我自己心中的恐惧。”2019年，叶诗文告诉《南方人物周刊》，说念大学使她对真实生活有了点认识，“我从小在运动队，太简单了，其实生活才是真正的竞技场！好好念书好好生活，一点不比争金夺银容易。”（参见过往报道《&lt;a href=&quot;https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/KEBWHU4A-URAvey1OiIXWQ&quot;>;叶诗文我的眼泪都流在泳池里了&lt;/a>;》）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;结果是无缘东京赛场，叶诗文可以休息了，她回到了家乡杭州。在杭州的家里，她全程关注着东京奥运会。 2021年7月23日，东京奥运会开幕当天，叶诗文在微博上转发了一则视频。视频是对她的采访，她在其中讲述了自己从伦敦巅峰到无缘东京的故事，配以转发语：“我的人生才刚刚开始。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那场盛大的赛事，没有叶诗文的身影。但在泳池，她的身影不曾消失。有人曾问她，“难道是真的喜欢游泳吗？”叶诗文的回答是肯定的，对于更多的游泳运动员而言，即便是冠军，他们也不见得真正享受游泳。因为天赋、体能、运气，年少成名，而后因为光环、惯性、外部期待，无从脱身，这样的运动员不少。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“运动队的生活是挺枯燥的，但是我喜欢这种为了一个目标，安静专注投入其中。我其实挺喜欢做运动员的，非常简单。”叶诗文选择重回竞技场，最大的一个原因是她想要真正面对自己，“遇到困难，不要逃跑，如果我在泳池里逃跑，将来我在学业、工作、生活中，都会逃跑的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;叶诗文没逃，她再次跃入了泳池，以职业运动员的心态。在这次杭州亚运会女子200米混合泳决赛中，18岁的小将余依婷以打破赛会纪录的成绩夺冠，叶诗文也获得了一枚银牌。她说，中国女子混合泳后继有人，这是她“最希望看到的”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那是叶诗文此次亚运会的第一枚奖牌，她不是冠军，但已然有了更为坚定平和的心态。 “成为冠军之后”的那门课，叶诗文修满了学分。带着这样的心态，3天后，9月28日，叶诗文获得杭州亚运会女子200米蛙泳金牌，距离她的上一块亚运金牌，时间已隔9年。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;与闻善同住的小尹（右）其实是编剧出身的闻善笔下的人物。 《不虚此行》（2023）剧照。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（资料图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“你可以有自己的名字了”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2023年9月上旬起，院线出现了两部被称为元电影的电影：刘伽茵的《不虚此行》和魏书钧的《永安镇故事集》。此前中国的院线有张艺谋的《一秒钟》、大鹏的《吉祥如意》、马来西亚陈翠梅的《野蛮人入侵》……魏书钧的下一部《河边的错误》据说也是元电影。所谓元电影，一般被认为是“关于电影的电影”。这类影片往往布满了针对电影创作以及电影运行机制的反思。它们往往带有探讨电影文本的理论色彩。当下，它们在电影院竟然如此密集地出现。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;感谢电影完熟时代。无限的交流、高速的传输、视觉手段的飞跃和易得，世界已经变成了一个巨大的摄影棚。在这样的时代，普通观众与元电影的隔膜程度远远降低了。人们比以往任何一个时候都更为熟悉电影的运作机制。虽然最近上映的这些影片，接受度上仍然落后于其他商业影片，但能在院线出现，已经可以作为文化现象来加以讨论了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《不虚此行》和《永安镇故事集》虽然被命名为元电影，但其实都并非创作者们的刻意为之，他们只是将自己的生活和工作的经验拍摄了出来。由于他们都是电影人，都陷入了关于电影的困惑中，当他们表达出自己的困惑，电影就自然而然地成为了元电影。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;奇妙的是，表达出自己的困惑的时刻，同时也是困惑被解决的时刻。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘伽茵导演的上一部影片《牛皮2》完成于2009年，距今已经有十四年。 《牛皮1》入围柏林国际电影节并获奖，《牛皮2》入围戛纳导演双周。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;十四年的“创作空白”对于电影人来说，一定意味着巨大的压力，况且她身在电影学院教书，周边全是在搞电影创作的行动者。我经常会问她，你的下一部什么时候拍出来？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《不虚此行》把这份压力用含蓄的方式表达了出来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是一部十分独特的影片，我记得过去的先锋实验小说有时候会这么做——让生活中作者感受到的压抑如数转化成阅读者的压抑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;导演也知道这是一种冒险，但一切都是深思熟虑过的。 《不虚此行》的主人公——胡歌饰演的闻善，以前是一位很不成功的编剧，现在在殡仪馆给人写追悼词。他对客户十分认真负责，经常带点迂腐地深入客户和死者之间的感情纠葛。理解这个世界，写出正确的悼词，也许就是他心目中的善。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;吴磊饰演的是与闻善同屋居住的年轻人小尹。这个角色被设定得怪异、虚无缥缈。影片进行到后半段，观众才恍然有所领悟，原来他是一个半成品，是作为编剧的闻善多年来企图创造的一个电影角色。当闻善对于自己的创作犹疑不定或者不自信的时候，小尹的存在方式、存在感就变得若有若无、明灭不定。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;小尹同时也在不停地追问闻善，你要真诚地面对自己的处境！他正是闻善的第二自我——这是符合逻辑的。当闻善抽烟时，他也会抽烟，但是他只有一身衣服，他一直穿着同样的上装，带着同样的帽子，而且也一直不长胡子——这是因为闻善没有把他真正地创造出来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当历经无数精神挣扎的闻善有一天终于自信地对小尹说“你可以有自己的名字了”的时候，我听到观众席中间爆发出一阵低沉的惊呼。这低沉的惊呼发生在北京电影学院的放映厅里，这是我第二次看此片的地点。观众席里多是搞创作的电影专业学生和电影人，所以他们更能领会这层关系。当然我相信，以写作为职业的人，都会领会到其中的微妙和激动人心之处，也能够同时回忆起创作时遭受的所有艰辛。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那一个电影时刻让我差点泪奔。一个虚构人物的诞生需要多少磨练才能真正得以实现。这不仅需要创作者的才华，还需要其他的契机。一个人物的难产也许来自于创作者多年来精神的深陷泥淖，他（她）也许失去了自信，失去了表达的勇气，有时候也是来自外部的压力，行业的独特规范和准入系统以及评价系统的混乱，让创作者失去创造的信心。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《不虚此行》刻画和反思了电影创作过程中一个非常深刻的剖面，揭示了创作的幽微之处。尽管在这部影片中，闻善写追悼词的情节展现的时间最长，但我觉得最为动人的是闻善和他的电影人物之间那种包含着恐惧的深情。这部影片能够获得第25届上海国际电影节最佳导演和最佳男演员，看来刘伽茵在影片中植入的内在世界还是被感受到了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《不虚此行》展现了一个不容易被觉察和表达的领域。影片中的一个细节让我印象深刻：闻善在电脑前工作打字的时候，输入法的惯性使得屏幕上经常蹦出一些令人不愉快的名字，这些名字是他作为编剧没有写成功的人物的名字。虽然他们没有诞生，但这些名字曾经经常被闻善使用，最后，输入法记住了它们。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“在永安镇，是不是什么都不会发生？”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;《永安镇故事集》对电影的反思更集中于人际层面，也更为社会化，尽管与《不虚此行》相比，这部没有顶流明星参与的影片也许不会收获很高的票房，但并不妨碍它是一部同样富有才华的影片。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这部影片也具有自传性。影片灵感来自魏书钧三年前在湖南拍摄他的第二部长片的经验。与《永安镇故事集》所展现的情节十分相似——在湖南，编剧和导演发生了剧本理念上的冲突，经过磨合，最终效果不佳，后来两人决定推翻重来。这个主要情节被移植到了《永安镇故事集》里。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有趣的是，魏书钧的上一部影片《野马分鬃》（2020）也是一部元电影。两部影片都在反思电影制作过程，片场生态比如电影人的颟顸、工作秩序的混乱、创作中不恰当的权力关系等等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《永安镇故事集》比《野马分鬃》更深入地讨论了电影叙事和现实世界的对应性：电影如何讲述永安镇故事？ &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在电影的三段式结构中，第一段落的开始，幕后纪录片导演在宾馆门口等待剧组，他要将剧组发生的一切都记录下来。剧组开进了永安镇，导演和编剧一起来了，落定后，有人说永安镇有一种宁静的美。编剧说，这不正体现了人的无力感么？就像我的剧本里说的——在永安镇什么都不会发生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;“在永安镇什么都不会发生”是编剧在自己的剧本中不断强调的主题，体现了他对永安镇的理解和判断。但导演对编剧的这个判断并不认同，要求编剧根据现实逻辑和人物逻辑进行修改。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一个主要矛盾迅速建立起来了。导演和编剧在争夺对于永安镇的阐释权，或者说争夺对于现实的阐释权。永安镇成为现实本身的象征。这个矛盾的发展和展开最终将落实在：“在永安镇，究竟是不是什么都不会发生？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第一段落出现了一位为剧组提供伙食的老板娘。老板娘身边经常伴随着一位老奶奶，老人家如同雕塑一般坐在店里，似乎颇为符合编剧对于永安镇的想象：静止，失去了行动性，在她那里，什么都不会发生。有一次，编剧见到老板娘，让她用方言把他提炼的至理名言说一遍，当老板娘说“在永安镇什么都不会发生”的时候，编剧开心地笑了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但那位一直静止的老奶奶，却借助一把带有轮子的椅子，忽然挪动了自己衰老的身体，离开了原来的位置。这一幕发生得不动声色，却似乎证明了某种“发生”。这一场戏细腻地体现了艺术家（比如编剧）对于本地生活者的文化霸权以及某种僭越。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那么，电影的态度是什么？在永安镇到底是不是什么都不会发生呢？年轻的老板娘处于哺乳期，丈夫做网约车司机，晚上把孩子丢给她照顾；白天，她还要帮公婆打理饭店，这饭店是她将来要继承的家业。这位女性被这样的家庭结构牢牢禁锢，似乎在她身上不会再有什么发生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;剧组的到来让她激动，她看到了一种崭新的可能性——她当机立断，给孩子断奶，上街做美甲，这是她的行动。只是制片人很快带来了女明星陈晨来饰演老板娘所渴望的角色。她的电影梦被击碎。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;老板娘的行动尽管未获成功，但不能否认她曾经拥有的行动力量。但，结局的不成功是对行动者的严重打击，这样的小镇故事的确是无法激励人们的行动性的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第二段落的主角——女明星陈晨，其实是从永安镇走出去的。陈晨被老同学热烈欢迎，但并未享受到被尊重的感觉，她被“绑架”去为别人免费剪彩，本地官员粗俗不堪，对女性毫无尊重。让陈晨感到亲切的是老朋友陈宏，陈宏妻子邀请她去家里吃饭，这顿饭却将陈晨置于尴尬的境地，对方其实是想通过她走后门，把孩子送到剧组当演员。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陈宏夫妇的饰演者杨谨、王佳佳在现实中也是夫妻，王佳佳将小镇中年妇女把握得十分传神，她庸俗而精明，成功地败坏了丈夫和旧情人之间的一切美好感觉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陈晨仓皇逃离这个沼泽般的家庭，她对老同学说：“没有想到你变成这样子了！”陈宏说：“你白天还说怀念这里的生活！你现在成名了。你当年所以离开，不就是为了钱么？”陈晨说：“我之所以离开，就是不想过你老婆那样的生活！”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;编剧认为陈晨离开永安镇就是为了钱，而不是什么女性觉醒，陈宏对陈晨的行为的解释，竟然与编剧相同。可见编剧对于生活的理解，也并非完全出于主观臆断。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但陈晨为自己辩护，她的离开就是因为觉醒。这是两种对于永安镇的诠释，两位永安镇人的声音就是永安镇本身的声音，它意味着永安镇本身就是混沌、黏稠的所在。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;面对同样的外部对象，为何两位主创的观点迥异？第三段落将镜头对准一直在争论的两位主创，开始分析他们观念差异的来源。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;编剧喜欢手卷烟，导演不喜欢手卷烟。他们互相攻击对方的音乐爱好，导演喜欢RAP，追求斯派克•李的范儿，编剧认为喜欢RAP的都是装，唱来唱去就是说自己多牛，他更喜欢摇滚、古典音乐。当导演播放肖邦的音乐，编剧说，“这个音乐一响起来，我就感觉自己是在永安镇了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;编剧写了一个男孩追一个拉小提琴的女孩，到了人家楼下却没有行动，导演认为这太文艺腔了，而且人物不能没有行动。编剧说这个故事就是他的经历，自己就曾经如此这般地追女孩。 “我理解的生活就是人不会有那么多行动的！他们就靠着期待生活。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;每个人的自我都很强大，都觉得自己头顶上那根天线接收到的信号最为准确。这部电影用感性的方式写了一篇叫做《论创作观念差异的来源》的论文，也许还不止一篇。第三段落其实给出了部分答案，这差异源自经验，也源自性情。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;编剧根据两人交流所得重写了一遍剧本，但导演发现这剧本千疮百孔，彻底失去了拍摄价值。他们将剧本扔在地上，已经丧失了理智。正在这个冲突白热化的时刻，导演没有寻求正面解决矛盾，而是设计了一个富有形而上色彩的超越时刻，这时候微信铃声响了，大家都收到了同一个消息：马拉多纳死了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《阿根廷别为我哭泣》的音乐笼罩了所有的人，包括陈宏夫妇、饭店老板娘，大家在那一刻都超越和升华了，剧本的矛盾显然也被超越了。没有解决，胜似解决，主创们要在一个更高的维度上解决这次电影创作的问题，他们决定推翻重来，电影结尾是电影《永安镇故事集》的开机仪式，他们开始了新的电影行动。他们把导演和编剧的矛盾搬演进了他们新的电影当中。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/0DiAOLGk9Wx2g67iGWbS9SbBOKB3s1fCfUsq3cq5.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;《永安镇故事集》讲述了一个剧组进驻永安镇拍摄电影的故事。 《永安镇故事集》（2021）剧照。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（资料图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;电影是否如实再现了现实？ &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;魏书钧对于叙事的驾驭能力，既能将叙事带向深入，也能迅速挣脱并超越。这种度的把握和叙事的平衡体现了一种少见的才华。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《永安镇故事集》制造了一个文本的迷宫。这部电影中有四五位导演出演角色，而且三个段落的标题由几部中国艺术电影的名字来命名。每部导演背后，都有他们的作品和文本，文本与文本之间都可以形成互文关系。这其中包含着一定的趣味性，你要做深入的解读吗？当然可以，但文本的排列组合会构成一种文本的深渊。也许在这里进行一种模糊的联想已经足够了。最为重要的还是《永安镇故事集》的“本事”部分。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所谓电影完熟时代，即是电影作品已经被文本化了。将“作品”以“文本”代替，其内涵就是对传统创作观念的全面反思和质疑。作品意味着作者和作品、作品与现实、作者与现实等几重关系之间紧密的对应关系。现在这种关系被质疑了。电影是否如实再现了现实？制片人不停地干预和影响创作，导演果真是电影作者么？导演是否忠于现实？或者说他是否有准确理解生活的能力？电影生产具有强烈的不纯粹性，它随时可以失控。这可以看作《永安镇故事集》的启示。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;元电影，也就是上面说的文本化的电影。这个概念其实翻译得不够好，但我们姑且这么使用吧，而我在这里更想讨论的是中国电影领域的一个新的成规模的动向。我们如何评价这个动向？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;魏书钧的上一部影片《野马分鬃》也是元电影，我记得有评论者认为这位导演过于自恋了，他们对魏书钧喊话——生活中不只有电影！评论者有这样的态度，我很理解，但我认为这还是将魏书钧的创作倾向病理化了。我不愿意这么去看。就《野马分鬃》来说，它虽然是元电影，拍摄了导演自己的生活，但它一样有深刻的社会分析和社会批判。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;电影完熟时代，不仅在于人们已经看了足够多的影片，熟悉了电影史、电影典故，明白互文性的奥秘；也不仅仅指他们的生命时间与广义上的电影有了更多的重合、日常更多地通过广义电影的形式进行交往……还在于我们已经熟悉了影片的文化机制，从片场生产到意识形态的运作机制；它意味着在当下，技术和媒体的发展带给我们的“自我影像化浪潮”已经席卷了我们每个人的生活，重建了我们生活的组织形式和感受模式——想一想私影像的卷土重来，想一想抖音和民间带货者的自发表演……&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;电影完熟时代，也在于当下一切电影形式似乎都被穷尽之后，人们重新思考电影的可能性，包括重新思考新技术的开拓，重新思考电影和现实之间的关系……我们已经处于一个剧烈的电影反思和新的电影本体论时代，它构建了我们时代的一种新的文化精神。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《不虚此行》和《永安镇故事集》的产生有创作者本来的生活线索可以追寻，但更有电影完熟时代的宏观背景。这些影片虽然充满了自我指涉，充满了电影本体的探讨，但它们都没有游离于历史时间之外。 &lt;/p>;
