He was one year younger than me. He was born in 1953 and left before he was seventy. According to our Chinese concept, it was a bit early. Maybe he had a bad life and stayed up late for a long time to translate, which damaged his health. My friend Mr. Liu Xianping from the Writers Association told me that he suffers from diabetes, which is so severe that he is about to have his limbs amputated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the history of Sino-Russian cultural exchanges, Yegov can be regarded as a very contributory figure. First, as the Chinese editor of the Soviet State Literature Publishing House, he devoted great efforts to introducing Chinese literature to the Soviet Union and later to Russia for decades. Secondly, as a Russian sinologist, he translated the works of some writers during the May 4th Movement period such as Mao Dun. Later, he focused mainly on contemporary Chinese literature. The writers he translated included Su Tong, Yu Hua, Mo Yan, Bi Feiyu, etc. He has also translated some English works, but, in his own words, it is to earn royalties and support the Chinese literature he loves to translate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For me, Yegov is my colleague in work. In terms of business, we can provide each other with practical and useful help and solve problems on the manuscript. At the same time, we are also friends who can open our hearts and exchange ideas, even though our views are sometimes inconsistent or even diametrically opposed on certain issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/FRX7dNtX47uH6giJM1SY6JrX5OfBBtjIW5eTIhRk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;646&quot; height= &quot;944&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/FRX7dNtX47uH6giJM1SY6JrX5OfBBtjIW5eTIhRk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253112&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Photo taken during Ye Guofu&#39;s first visit to Beijing in the 1990s. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the author)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Ten Days in Beijing&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Ye Guo and I The first time I met my husband was in March 1990. As the Chinese editor of the Leningrad branch of the Soviet State Literature Publishing House, he came to visit the People’s Literature Publishing House where I worked. At that time, Sino-Soviet relations had just begun to normalize. I remember that after the &quot;Selected Novels of Rasputin&quot; that I edited was published in 1982, I gave the author several donated books at the request of the Soviet Embassy. I sent the gift letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as required, and they handed it over to the Soviet Embassy. In 2006, Rasputin came to Beijing Foreign Studies University for a meeting. He told me that he had only heard that a collection of his novels had been published in China, but he had never seen it. When Sholokhov passed away in 1984, researcher Sun Meiling of the Institute of Foreign Languages ​​and Literatures of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences wrote a short message, but there was no place to publish it. The same is true in the publishing industry. It was not until 1986 and 1987 that the leaders of the Soviet State Literature Publishing House and the People&#39;s Literature Publishing House realized mutual visits. In 1989, when our older generation editors Sun Shengwu, Jiang Lu, Xu Leiran, Chen Siyong, and Lu Yongfu visited the Soviet Union, they also visited their publishing house. This time they came to visit for ten days. The formal talks were translated by old comrade Mr. Cheng Wen. I was only responsible for accompanying them on sightseeing and shopping, so everyone was relatively relaxed and casual, talking and laughing. I no longer went to the Soviet Union in the early 1980s. That kind of nervousness at the embassy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Four editors came to this visit from the Soviet State Literature Publishing House: Director of the Foreign Literature Editorial Office Klimova, English editor; Chinese editor Yaroslavsky, an old comrade who is over 60 years old , has translated many Chinese classical literary works, and he translated the poems in the Russian version of &quot;Jin Ping Mei&quot;; and Yura Ilyashin, a young Chinese editor who came to China in 1984 as a reporter for the TASS News Agency and reformed After the opening up, he set up a company in China and published the newspaper &quot;Hand to Hand&quot;. These three people are all from the Moscow headquarters, while Yegov is from the Leningrad branch, and his name on his business card is the director of the editorial office. It seemed that he was not very familiar with the three people at the head office, so I took more care of him and spent a longer time chatting with him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the conversation, I learned that Yegov, Yura and I both started learning each other&#39;s language in the early 1970s, shortly after the &quot;Zhenbao Island Incident&quot;. The purpose is self-evident and everyone knows it well. I told Ye Guofu that in 1969 I was an educated youth, and the Heilongjiang Production and Construction Corps station where I was located was only 95 kilometers away from Zhenbao Island. His eyes widened in surprise. I continued to tell him: Back then, there was an old high school senior in the company who taught everyone how to speak Russian every morning. I remember the first sentence I learned was: &quot;Raise your hands!&quot; He was startled at first, and was stunned for a moment, but he immediately became alert. Di replied in Chinese: &quot;Hand in the gun and not kill!&quot; We both laughed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another reason why Yegov and I had more contact during those ten days was that our speaking skills were pretty much the same. Yura was stationed in Beijing in 1984 when he was a reporter. I met him at the embassy. His listening and speaking abilities were better than ours. I talked with Yegov. He rushed to speak Chinese and I rushed to speak Russian. He only spoke his own language when he really didn&#39;t understand. It seemed that he was afraid of losing the opportunity to exercise and suffer a disadvantage. Yegov is a shy man. He blushes when seeing our old comrades. He speaks softly and has an elegant manner. He is very Leningrader and not as flamboyant as a Muscovite. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When they came, they were very interested in shopping, but shopping is my weakness. Every day after get off work, I would memorize Russian words that I might need the next day until late at night. Despite careful preparation, there were still many troubles. One morning, the four of them said seriously that they wanted to buy a must-buy food entrusted by a friend. It was round and colorful in shape and would grow bigger when fried in oil. Yaroslavsky also ridiculously made a sudden explosion with his hands, and made a &quot;pop&quot; sound from his mouth at the same time. The more vividly they described it, the richer my imagination became. I couldn&#39;t figure it out, so I had to lead them into the Dongdan Vegetable Market. We divided the troops into four groups, each of them holding an aisle, and searched carefully. After a while, Klimova&#39;s cry of surprise came. I went over to take a look and it turned out to be shrimp crackers. In order to avoid such trouble and lively atmosphere, I invited Mr. Gao Mang when I visited the Great Wall. He spoke very well. The four guests were extremely excited to see Gao Mang, as if meeting old friends in a foreign land, and they poured out all the words they had been holding in their hearts for several days. Yegov told me that Mr. Gao Mang was very famous in the Soviet Union. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main result of their visit was to confirm the publishing plans of both parties in the next three years: Su Fang published &quot;Nie Haihua&quot;, &quot;Selected Poems of the Song Dynasty&quot;, &quot;Dream of Red Mansions&quot; and selected works by Guo Moruo, Lao She and Mao Dun; our publisher Published several volumes of &quot;Collected Works of Tolstoy&quot;, &quot;Collected Works of Pushkin&quot;, &quot;Selected Works of Turgenev&quot; and an &quot;Encyclopedic Dictionary of Literature&quot;. The most important thing is that the two publishing houses will each publish a collection of contemporary novels from the other, and the selections will be recommended by the other. The People&#39;s Literature Publishing House completed this project in the second year, but the Soviet State Literature Publishing House failed to publish it until it was disbanded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My personal gain is that my hearing has improved. They tell Soviet jokes every day, and sometimes I can’t believe my ears. In my impression, Yegov didn&#39;t say a word, and always maintained a gentlemanly attitude, as if he was listening. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/XxLnwV880wUjnjlmhS6tWDYQLFbVcyMwEE1N951f.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1029&quot; height= &quot;750&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/XxLnwV880wUjnjlmhS6tWDYQLFbVcyMwEE1N951f.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253114&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Yegov and the author of this article in front of the People&#39;s Literature Publishing House. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the author)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Three-month internship&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;1991 In May, I was dispatched by the Press and Publication Administration to work as an intern editor at the Soviet State Literary Publishing House. Klimova and Yura Ilyashin, who had just visited our publisher in 1990, were responsible for receiving me and were very warm to me. They also held a welcome meeting for the external editors&#39; office, met with their leaders at all levels, and visited their publishing house. , they treat me like a newly assigned colleague. By the way, this publishing house, especially the configuration of language staff in the foreign literature editing room, is very similar to our publishing house, except that there are more editors in the Indian language group. After I came back and talked about this situation, President Chen Wanchun said: It should be said that we are just like them. President Feng Xuefeng visited this publishing house in 1951, and our publishing house adopted the configuration of their publishing houses when it was first established. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 19, according to their arrangements, we arrived in Leningrad. As the head of the branch, Yegov received us and accompanied us on literary sightseeing every day - many writers in the history of literature have left their footprints in Leningrad. Yegov is a native of Leningrad, and he also knows many stories about the corners. . After visiting Tsarskoye Selo on June 24, while resting on the lawn in front of the square, Yegov and I had a debate about the October Revolution and socialism. We spoke Russian for a while and Chinese for a while. The accompanying staff laughed. . Yegov told me some social situations, which surprised me. While eating in the cafeteria of the Moscow headquarters, I also heard someone say that I thought it was because of my poor hearing and didn&#39;t understand, but I always felt that something happened. I asked Yura, and his answer was vague and obviously prevaricating, unlike Yegov&#39;s straightforwardness. At that time, the Soviet Union was experiencing painful struggles before its death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 16, 1991, we ended our three-month internship in the Soviet Union and returned to Beijing. Four days later, the &quot;8·19&quot; incident that shocked the world occurred in Moscow&#39;s Red Square. The Soviet Union collapsed on December 25 of the same year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/u4OebnAlHlHNyPKHIOtGbGBubmFSfLht7XayGjrl.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;803&quot; height= &quot;574&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/u4OebnAlHlHNyPKHIOtGbGBubmFSfLht7XayGjrl.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253110&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Photographed in Yegov&#39;s office in 1992. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the author)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;One year of further study&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;November 1992 In August, I returned to Leningrad again, this time being sent by the State Education Commission to study for a year. At this time, Leningrad was being renamed St. Petersburg. The first sign to be replaced was the Leningrad Railway Station sign. I specially rushed to watch it. Looking at the slowly falling &quot;Leningrad&quot; sign, I felt extremely complicated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before I settled down at Leningrad University, Yegov came to see me. Seeing that I was living in a crowded four-person room, he was a little embarrassed, as if he had made such a bad arrangement for me. But within a few days, I was transferred to a single room. One day in the lobby on the first floor, the dormitory administrator stopped me and insisted on chatting with me. He first introduced himself: a member of the Soviet Communist Party and one of the first pilots after the outbreak of the Great Patriotic War. However, he was quickly shot down and transferred to the hospital for treatment. When he recovered and was ready to return to the sky, the war ended. Then he said that he respected me very much and knew that I had introduced many Russian writers to China. He even knew that I had translated the works of Semyonov. This writer was a household name in the Soviet Union and had written works about the Soviet-German spy war. After questioning me carefully, I found out that it was Yegov who told him so that he could change me to a better room. This veteran administrator was cunning, selfish, and did some ridiculous things, but he gave me a lot of help during my year of studying abroad. I am very grateful to him, and even more grateful to Yegov. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The publishing house where Yegov worked was located in the most beautiful and lively area on Nevsky Prospekt, on the top floor of the St. Petersburg Bookstore. This building, built in the 18th century, is opposite the famous Kazan Church, so it welcomes a large number of tourists from all over the world every day. As one of the largest bookstores in Europe, St. Petersburg Bookstore not only sells the latest books in Russia and various foreign publications, but also a variety of cultural supplies and souvenirs. It also often holds various book fairs, book clubs, new book launches and author signings. Book signing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Leningrad University where I have classes every day is right by the Neva River. I can walk across the bridge to Nevsky Prospekt. If I take the subway, it is just one stop away, so I often come to this bookstore. As a publisher, I like it here. Besides, Yegov is upstairs. When you are tired, you can go to his office to sit, drink hot water and smoke a cigarette. There are benches in the corridor where you can lie down. Most of the people in their editorial office knew me, and they entertained me when Yegov was away. Ye Guofu was obsessed with translation at that time and always looked forward to my going. Sometimes he knew that I had gone to the bookstore but not upstairs, and he still didn&#39;t understand. Almost every time he went, he would take out a few pages of paper prepared in advance, with problems to be solved written on them. There was a space after each question for me to write my opinion, and I just had to rewrite it into sentences he could understand. Ye Guofu is a very smart man. This way, we can avoid misunderstandings due to oral expressions and leave the words in black and white for him to ponder carefully. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I remember that I helped him do one thing, which was the project signed by the two publishers in 1990 - each other published a collection of contemporary novels from each other, and the task of the Russian version of the collection of contemporary Chinese novels was handed over to him. Yegov. At that time, the Chinese manuscripts recommended by the Chinese side were piled on his desk. According to the editing style, each writer had a biography. These biographies were all handwritten by the writers themselves, with different number of words and different styles and formats. Some even included the words &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;. &quot;The allegro lyrics created by Zhongzai&#39;s publicity team were also included. Lao Ye was confused and asked me for help with a grimace. I rewrote it into a hundred words. Lao Ye understood and was very grateful. It took me some time and effort so I remember. Ye Guofu mentioned this matter several times when he came to Beijing and felt sorry for me because the book was not published in the end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, he had finished translating Su Tong&#39;s &quot;Wives and Concubines&quot; and asked me to &quot;correct&quot; him. I have not read this novel, but I read it carefully in order to revise Yegov&#39;s translation. Regarding the serious errors in his translation, I only corrected them without explaining them. Instead, I raised objections to his criteria for selecting the translation. I said to him: What the author describes is a very special kind of abnormal life in China and does not have universal typical significance. Furthermore, after being translated into another language, a lot of essence has been lost, which does not reflect the level of contemporary Chinese literary creation. I suggested that he translate &quot;There&#39;s a Snowstorm Tonight&quot; by Liang Xiaosheng. It&#39;s on the recommendation list and I&#39;ve read it. It&#39;s very good. But he said: The content described in this novel is very similar to Khrushchev&#39;s Siberian reclamation, and Russian readers will not like it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yegov worked very hard on translation at that time. In addition to achieving his own lofty goals, there was also a very practical reason. In St. Petersburg in 1993, life was difficult for ordinary people. My teacher told me that sometimes wages are not paid on time. When you get rubles, you have to change them into dollars immediately, and then into rubles when you use them. When we first went there, it seemed that one dollar was exchanged for 300 rubles, and a month later it was exchanged for 400. Half a year later, when I went to Moscow University, I actually got 1,300 rubles in the Vietnamese dormitory. Mr. Qi Yide, who translated &quot;Sanyan Erpai&quot;, was a famous sinologist of the older generation. She called one night and said she had not bought any bread. I would take a short detour to school and pass by her house. Sometimes I would buy some bread or something, hang it on her doorknob, and call her to let her know. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Two Unforgettable Things&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Ye Guofu earned extra money by translating to supplement his family income. From my contact with him, I deeply felt that he was a very family-oriented man who treated his wife and children very much like a good Chinese man. He is also sincere and enthusiastic in helping people, and will go all out when you need him. On August 14, 1993, I received a long-distance call from China from Li Yuxia, director of the foreign literature editorial office of our newspaper. She asked me to immediately find a solution to the problem of &quot;Destruction&quot;, &quot;Young Guards&quot; and &quot;Quiet Don&quot;. There is a copyright issue because there are domestic publishers who took action before us. From the tone of her voice and the speed of her speech, I could tell that the situation was critical. These three books are the standing books of our society, especially the latter two. They have been reprinted every year since the early 1980s. As soon as we joined the Berne Convention, publishers came to snatch us up. As the editor in charge of these three books, I was naturally impatient. I found Yegov on the same day and explained the situation to him. The next day he helped me contact Sholokhov’s copyright heir, his daughter Svetlana. She told me that she had indeed received an application from a Chinese publisher, but had not signed it yet. She also told me that Sholokhov once had the opportunity to visit China, but it was a pity that he did not make the trip. Svetlana promised that the copyright would be given to People&#39;s Literature Publishing House. From her words, I felt that Yegov had talked to her beforehand, and she knew everything, so I didn’t need to waste any words. Two days later, I went to the Moscow Literary Publishing House. Yura helped me contact Fadeev’s widow. Her answer reassured me: “My sample books are all published by the People’s Literature Publishing House. Of course, this book is also Published by you.&quot; The thing that made me panic was solved smoothly with the help of two friends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is another thing that makes me very grateful to Yegov. In September 1993, my wife was coming to Leningrad to visit relatives. There were no mobile phones at that time, and it was difficult to make long-distance calls. Somehow, Ye Guov became the hub of communication between me and my wife, the &quot;mouthpiece&quot; for information, probably because there was a phone in his office that could make international long distance calls. He seemed to be an official at that time. I checked the diary from that year and found that Ye Guofu came to my dormitory five or six times that month. The last time was at eight o&#39;clock in the evening, telling my wife the time of departure from Beijing and arrival in Moscow. Why didn&#39;t you tell me over the phone? Maybe it was because I was afraid that I wouldn’t understand and misunderstood, so I talked about it in person and wrote it down on a piece of paper. It shows how serious and reliable he is. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few days after his wife arrived, Yegov invited us to his home. He even picked us up at the subway station that day. In fact, I have been to his house many times and the route is very familiar to me. When he entered, his wife dressed up to welcome him very warmly and set a table full of delicious food. An interesting thing happened before dinner started. I was browsing his collection of books in Yegov&#39;s room. Yegov, who was originally translating for the host and guest, walked in quietly, patted my shoulder gently, and pointed outside. I looked over and saw two ladies sitting on the sofa who didn&#39;t understand each other&#39;s language at all. They were beaming and talking animatedly. Yegov and I looked at each other for a moment and almost laughed. We had a great time that day, and the two ladies hugged each other at the subway entrance before parting, like good sisters who have been friends for many years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/oQHaE8Mt6wDy1tGR95ozF8U59FdOQEjP97UhYA8M.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;908&quot; height= &quot;522&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/oQHaE8Mt6wDy1tGR95ozF8U59FdOQEjP97UhYA8M.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253113&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 2012, Ye Guofu (second from left) and Mo Yan (third from left) met at the People&#39;s Literature Publishing House. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the author)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;See you again in twenty years&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In the first few years after returning to China, I still communicated with Ye Guofu and asked someone to take care of me. Later, we lost contact. Around 2000, someone told me that the original Soviet State Literature Publishing House was dissolved and no longer existed. Until 2012, a colleague told me that Ye Guofu came to me online and said that he would come to Beijing to hold an international seminar for sinologists. Twenty years later, we met at the hotel where he was staying. He held my hand and said that I have not aged, and I held his hand and said that he still looks the same. We all know we are telling lies. We resumed our conversation the next day in my office. I showed him the Russian literary works I had edited and published over the past 20 years, and he told me about his journey in the past 20 years and the works he had translated. He said that he had been reading Mo Yan&#39;s novels for several years, found a feeling for them, and started translating them. When talking about his experience, he also said, like some people, that Mo Yan&#39;s novels were influenced by Western &quot;magic realism&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I told him that most Chinese writers create their own works. As far as the writers I have read, I don’t think any of them have been influenced by foreign writers. If we talk about influence, it is also the region where they were born and their innate personal personalities. These two factors determine their storytelling methods and characteristics. For example, if I ask Mo Yan, he is actually telling the story of the land and water where he was raised in Gaomi, Shandong Province, using his unique storytelling method, just like his fellow Shandong fellow Pu Songling used his method to tell the story of &quot;Liao Zhai Zhi&quot;. &quot;different&quot; same. Their place in Shandong has this long literary tradition and is rich in this kind of literature. Yegov seems to understand vaguely, but I feel that our conversation today seems to be a continuation of the conversation in Leningrad about the criteria for selecting translation works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I showed him the contemporary Russian literary works published by our agency in the past ten years, including more than a dozen novels and four short story collections, involving more than 70 writers, including those who became famous in the 1950s. There are new works by the old writer Graning, works by the world-famous Rasputin in the 1960s, and award-winning young writers in the 1980s and 1990s. He was very surprised when he saw it. The translated works of Russian contemporary literature published by our publishing house were as good as the translated works of Chinese contemporary literature published in Russia. Probably touching his sadness, he vomited his bitterness to me, saying how difficult it was to publish a Chinese literary work in Russia, not to mention that China has a huge readership of Russian literature, and all the publishing houses in Russia are now He founded a private publishing house and only focused on profits...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 21, 2012, Ye Guofu called and told him that he would meet with Mr. Mo Yan tomorrow and asked me to attend. The location could be in my office. Of course I agree. Mr. Mo Yan came earlier the next day. He gave me two of his books, and I gave me a set of &quot;The Quiet Don River&quot; that I edited. Mr. Mo Yan is a very down-to-earth, sincere and natural person. He does not seem like the kind of person who hides his hidden agenda. In fact, I met him, I remember it was at the Strindberg Seminar at Peking University, and he even gave a speech. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I chatted with Mr. Mo Yan for a while, and then Ye Guofu came. The two of them didn&#39;t seem to know each other very well, and they were a little reserved at first. Yegov was not a good talker. Fortunately, I soon let go. Mr. Mo Yan is still very good at leading the topic and livening up the atmosphere. At that time, I thought Mo Yan was quite eloquent and thought he could tell stories. I heard Mr. Feng Jicai tell a story. It was when he was revising a manuscript at the People&#39;s Literature Publishing House. At that time, he asked to turn off the lights, saying that it would be more effective. So I think most writers have the talent to tell stories. The topic that day basically revolved around Mr. Mo Yan’s creations. The president, Comrade Guan Shiguang, came for more than half an hour. Yegov didn&#39;t talk much. He talked about Chinese literature, especially the &quot;experience&quot; of contemporary Chinese literature in Russia, and how difficult it was to publish his translation of Mo Yan&#39;s works... I also know something about this situation. I participated in several book fairs and book ordering events in Moscow and Leningrad. I never saw a single Chinese literary work, but occasionally came across one or two books with a touch of &quot;Kung Fu&quot;. . By the end of the day, everyone was still chatting happily. I checked the diary of that day: &quot;We chatted from 2 pm to 6 pm, and then had dinner at Jiuyefu Restaurant opposite the publishing house until 8:30.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The day before returning to China, we went together During dinner, Ye Guofu told me that Mr. Liu Zhenyun also wanted to translate a few of his works and asked me to express my opinion. I said: &quot;You know, there is an old saying in China: The writing is like the person. Mo Yan is from Shandong, his writing is straightforward, and he tells stories. Liu Zhenyun is from Henan, his writing is melodramatic, and he has the unique humor of Henan people. His works are exquisite It is taste, and taste is difficult to translate. For example, there is a sentence in Lu Xun&#39;s &quot;The Story in the Hair&quot;: &quot;Most of the families lazily walked out a citizen.&quot; The word &quot;pace&quot; and &quot;国&quot; in it have been translated , is boring. Another example is your translation of &quot;Big Breasts, Wide Butts&quot;. If a Russian writer who has never seen the original work is translated into Chinese based on your translation, it will probably be translated into &quot;Big Breasts, Wide Butts&quot;. &quot;, what&#39;s the taste?&quot; I suddenly realized something was wrong and couldn&#39;t help laughing. Ye Guofu seemed to have realized something, and he laughed out loud. I told him again that when I was an intern at the Moscow Literary Publishing House in 1991, they asked me many questions about the translation of Lao She&#39;s works and &quot;Dream of Red Mansions&quot;, mostly about the &quot;meaning&quot; behind the words. I also told him about the &quot;Water Margin&quot; (Russian-Chinese version of the Greater China Library), which I was responsible for publishing. I carefully compared the problems found in Luo Gaoshou&#39;s translation. I wanted to further prove that what was lost when the two languages ​​were exchanged was the essence. Mainly This is because some words and expressions in Chinese are not found in Russian. Choose carefully. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The last meeting&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The last time I met Yegov was on August 28, 2014, at the &quot;Chinese-Russian Literature Translation&quot; held at the Russian Embassy Publishing Project&quot; meeting. There were a lot of people that day, and Yegov suddenly dragged the Russian writer Yesin to me, jokingly saying that he wanted to go through the back door: Yesin wanted his &quot;Death of Giants&quot; to be published by the People&#39;s Literature Publishing House. Yesin is a famous Russian writer and the dean of the Gorky Academy of Literature, and this novel is among the books recommended by Russia. So I obtained the consent of Liu Guohui, the leader of the society who came to the meeting with me, and called Mr. Liu Xianping from the Writers Association and the copyright association on the spot. Mr. Zhang Hongbo, the director-general and the person in charge of the &quot;Mutual Translation Project&quot; held a small meeting with Ye Xin and Ye Guofu and decided that &quot;Death of Giants&quot; would be published by our publisher and translated by Liu Xianping. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Probably we are not the only publishing house that works on-site like ours. The venue was always noisy, and Yegov and I never had time to talk alone. When it was almost over, Ye Guofu hurriedly pulled me to a quieter corner and told me excitedly that the Chinese Writers Association had given him a large sum of money, which was enough for him to devote himself to translation in a few years without having to worry about making a living. . Looking at his slightly moist eyes, I was also very happy. I knew that his life had not been easy over the years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rest in peace, Igor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is his nickname, and he likes me to call him that. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[偷餐者绑天桥示众？店家应该如此喝阻小偷吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258289]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;According to the Southern Metropolis Daily, a store in Mixue Bingcheng, Guangzhou issued a handwritten warning for stealing food, saying that those who steal food will be required to He was &quot;tied to a flyover and paraded in public for 8 hours&quot;, sparking heated discussions.

They said in the letter that they would do their best to take responsibility, fully cooperate with the police and other departments to find out the truth, and do their best to mitigate the impact of the incident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the same day, the Thai government announced a compensation plan. Suthawan, Thailand’s Minister of Tourism and Sports, said that Thailand will provide 6.2 million baht (approximately RMB 1.23 million) in compensation for each victim. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three days ago, on October 3, just a week after Thailand implemented a visa-free policy for Chinese tourists, a series of piercing gunshots rang out in the Siam Paragon shopping mall, and panicked crowds ran in all directions. The tragic shooting resulted in 2 deaths and 5 injuries. The Chinese victim was only 34 years old. At the time of the incident, she was traveling in Thailand with her 5-year-old twin daughters, and they originally planned to take a flight back to China early in the morning on October 4. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is surprising is that the perpetrator of the shooting was a boy who had just turned 14 years old. He is accused of suffering from mental illness and has been sent to a mental hospital in Bangkok for evaluation of his mental condition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sudden shooting not only made tourists in Thailand uneasy, but also worried Thailand, which is eager to revive the tourism industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jidi, chairman of the Thailand Tourism Marketing Association, told Thailand&#39;s &quot;Public Opinion&quot; that due to the vicious shooting at Siam Paragon, the number of foreign tourists to Thailand may decrease by 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Revenue shrank by 50 billion baht (approximately RMB 10 billion). &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;40 gunshots&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;If it weren’t for this shooting tragedy, Li Qian’s family could have spent a happy holiday in Thailand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At noon on October 3, 2023, Li Qian and his wife arrived in Bangkok by plane with their three-year-old child. After checking in at Chatrium Hotel, they were picked up directly from the hotel at around 4 p.m. The shuttle bus arrives at Siam Paragon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Paragon is located in Siam Square in the heart of Bangkok. It is the most famous luxury shopping mall in Bangkok and was once rated as the most photographed place in the world by Instagram. Li Qian decided to make the first stop of her trip to Thailand here, but what she didn&#39;t expect was that she would be greeted by continuous gunshots. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“As soon as I got to the second floor, I heard a loud bang. I immediately had a bad premonition. Before I could react, there were two more bangs and bangs in succession, and then... I heard screams from downstairs, and people started to run away. My husband rushed to the third floor with the child in his arms, and then there were several gunshots. I was so scared that my legs were weak, and I felt that bullets were behind me. He was about to be hit at any time.&quot; Li Qian recalled to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At 3:35 pm on October 3, the assailant took the light rail and entered Siam Paragon. Surveillance video showed that five minutes later, he walked into the bathroom on the M floor carrying a schoolbag containing bullets. At 4:10, gunshots were first heard in the bathroom. Immediately afterwards, a long-haired man wearing a black shirt and a baseball cap with an American flag printed on his head came out and started shooting at the crowd. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the gunfire rang out, Huahua was in the aisle separated from the bathroom where the incident occurred, waiting for friends who were shopping at the Chanel store. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I didn’t know the murderer was next to us at the time. I just heard the gunshots very clearly.” Huahua told Southern Weekend reporters, “I thought it was a robbery of a luxury store at first. It was nothing special. It wasn’t until we later watched the news and discovered he was right next to us that we started to feel a little scared.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At 4:25, the assailant came to the second floor and continued shooting. Minutes later, he took the escalator to the third floor and continued shooting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, the gunman called the Thai police phone number to surrender, and clearly told the police his location and specific clothing. At 5:10, he was arrested in a home furnishing store on the third floor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Bangkok Post&quot; quoted a source familiar with the investigation as saying that before his arrest, the suspect fired about 40 shots in the mall, and a total of 11 shots were found on the dead and injured. bullet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despite the frightening moment, Li Qian and others were at least lucky enough to return home safely. However, a Chinese tourist and a Burmese migrant worker in Thailand left their lives in Thailand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to reports from the Thai police, the shooting at Siam Paragon resulted in 2 deaths and 5 injuries, and the initiator was a 14-year-old boy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Thailand&#39;s MGR Online news network, the suspect in the shooting incident was born in 2009 and just turned 14 years old on September 21. He is the eldest son in the family.其家境十分富裕，父亲在一所知名大学任职。该少年就读于一所私立学校，一年学费数十万泰铢，在校期间曾获2017学年杰出学生奖。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为曼谷的顶级豪华购物中心，暹罗百丽宫自称拥有严格的安保措施。然而，凶手顺利携枪进入。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;泰国国家警察总署署长托萨克在接受采访时解释，因为涉事枪支被改造为塑料结构，所以未能及时被发现，且商场的安保也不像机场那样一直都很严格，一直有人进出，检测仪器很难对每个人都进行精密检查。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但多名枪击案当事人向南方周末记者回忆，暹罗百丽宫并没有安检措施，只有两三个保安在门口值守。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;枪击案发生后，刚抵达泰国几个小时的李倩就改签了第二天回国的机票。 “直到飞机落地的那一刻才真正感觉安全。从看新闻的人变成了新闻里的人，一切都是那么不真实。”李倩说，如今听到视频中的枪声，还是会被瞬间拉回到枪击现场。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;华华则和朋友继续心惊胆颤地在泰国逛了一天，但她们没敢再去暹罗逛街。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;精神问题？ &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;百丽宫监控录像显示，被捕时，这名14岁的疑犯神情呆滞、眼神闪烁，且一直在喃喃自语。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;托萨克表示，这名少年过去曾因心理健康问题在Rajavithi医院接受过治疗，但在事发当天没有服药。 “他觉得有人告诉他射击这个或那个人，就像他身体内部有另一个&#39;他&#39;一样。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另外一位常与行凶少年一起在网上打游戏的网友说，“他经常会表现得情绪激动，看得出来心理包袱很重。”该网友还透露，少年曾提及自己有精神分裂症状，但没有服药控制。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过少年的父母则表示，儿子沉迷于射击类游戏，但从未有过任何精神病史治疗记录。其母亲在接受泰国电视台One news31采访时说，她怀疑孩子喜欢用射击来宣泄情感。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;目前，行凶少年已被送往曼谷精神病院接受拘留及治疗，该院专家将评估其是否患有精神疾病。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;泰国文华律师事务所律师瓦新估计，精神鉴定结果大概会在两三周之内出具，随后检查报告将于一个月之内移交给有关部门。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;综合泰国媒体的报道来看，枪击案并不是少年一时兴起，而是提前做足了准备。泰国新闻网站The Thaiger直言不讳地将此次枪击案称为“有预谋的谋杀”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据《曼谷邮报》报道，该少年本来计划在网上购买真枪，但由于价格过高，他随后通过在线借贷平台借钱，退而求其次以16000泰铢（约合人民币3164元）购买了一把改装过的空枪。而在少年的家中，警方另外又搜查出了两把枪支以及大量弹药。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;案发前，该少年还曾邀约一起练习射击的朋友同去暹罗百丽宫，直至抵达商场的那一刻，他还和朋友视频通话，表示自己“要开枪了”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;嫌疑人被逮捕后，警方从他的手机中发现了其在靶场中进行真枪实弹射击练习的视频，其中包括换弹和打靶的片段。亦有网友发帖称，自己此前曾在“曼谷射击俱乐部”偶遇行凶者，他当时的穿戴和行凶当天一模一样。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;昔日的杰出学生为何变成持枪杀手，目前仍不得而知。不过泰国《民意报》报道指出，警方经过初步调查发现，在暹罗百丽宫持枪杀人的14岁少年面临学业上的困扰，其学习成绩不佳，但是父母强迫其要提高学习成绩。有聊天证据显示，嫌疑少年被父母催促提高学习成绩后，反而发送自己在靶场射击的视频并表示“我要去这里”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;10月4日，泰国曼谷京都警察局负责人表示，警方对制造枪击案的14岁嫌疑人提出5项初步指控，分别是蓄意杀人、实施杀人、非法持枪、未经许可携带枪支进入公共场所、未经许可在公共场所开枪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“在泰国，枪击致人死亡可以判处死刑、无期徒刑或者15到20年有期徒刑。但由于泰国很少执行死刑，所以最高一般只会判处无期徒刑。”瓦新分析，“现在嫌疑人只有14岁，他大概率会被判15-20年有期徒刑。但与此同时，法院可能会采取诸如少管所、精神病院监禁等措施来代替坐牢。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“精神疾病并不能成为脱罪的理由，但如果最终认定有精神疾病，法院可能会根据他的相关病史酌情减刑，最终可能会判处10-15年有期徒刑，甚至不排除刑期不超过10年的可能性。”瓦新补充说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;迟来的枪支管控&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;这不是泰国第一次发生大规模枪击事件。近三年来，泰国已连续发生三起枪击惨案。而此次暹罗百丽宫枪击案，正值托儿所屠杀惨案一周年之际。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年10月6日，泰国东北部农磨兰普府乌泰沙旺镇一名前警员持枪持刀闯入一家托儿所，杀死38人，其中24人是儿童。凶手事后回到家中，杀死妻儿并自尽。泰国公共广播电视台报道指出，这是泰国历史上第一次以儿童场所为目标的大规模恐怖袭击。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此前的2020 年2月，一名泰国军人在东北部城市呵叻府一购物中心内持枪大开杀戒，共造成29人死亡，57人受伤。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;国际特赦组织人权研究员、泰国人塔蒂亚卡隆旺指出，鉴于近年来发生三起类似事件，提醒泰国社会这可能不仅仅是孤立的不幸事件，需要重新评估该国枪支暴力是否一个系统性问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;直到枪击案发生前，华华都不知道泰国可以合法持枪，也从来没有想过这样的事情会发生在自己身上。但事实上，泰国是亚洲拥枪率和枪支相关死亡率最高的国家之一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;瑞士日内瓦研究机构“小型武器调查”2017年开展的一项研究显示，泰国总人口约为7000万，然而持有枪支数量却多达1034万支，其中合法登记的只有约620万支。据调查人员估计，泰国每100人中就有15人拥有枪支，拥枪率为东盟第一，亚洲第二，仅次于巴基斯坦。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另据美国智库《世界人口审查》2022年发布的数据，泰国每10万人中有3.91人死于枪击，在东盟国家中排名第二，仅次于菲律宾。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于枪支管控，泰国的相关法律不可谓不严格。 “年满20周岁的泰国公民需要经过严格的背景审查才能合法持枪，而且不允许在公共场合持枪，只能用于自卫和狩猎等特定用途。与此同时，公民必须把枪支外壳、弹簧和子弹等配件分开储存，不能放置在同一个地方。”瓦新指出。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但在合法持枪之外，仍有大量的进口枪支以及仿制武器可以在黑市和网络上自由交易。瓦新表示，类似的黑枪在泰国普遍存在。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;泰国警察总署2019年的调查数据显示，当年泰国境内共发生枪支相关案件超3.14万起，其中涉案枪支为未登记注册的非法枪支的案件超过2.43万起，占案件总数的77.5%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“许多非法枪支走私进入泰国，而互联网销售正在加剧这一趋势。”泰国兰实大学犯罪学家克里萨纳蓬告诉法新社，“然而，只有少数警察具备在线追踪枪支市场的知识、能力和经验。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;枪击惨案发生后，泰国警方雷厉风行逮捕了6名向行凶少年出售枪支和弹药的嫌疑人。与此同时，泰国官方明确表示要强化枪支管控措施，堵住在线枪支销售的法律漏洞。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;10月5日，泰国内政部召开会议，批准13项枪支管制措施，具体包括加强枪械登记管理、停止颁发枪械经营许可证和随身携带枪械许可证、申请持枪者须提供精神健康状况医学证明、严打非法武器交易网站、重新定义仿真枪等短期和长期控枪措施。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其实类似的举措不过是旧事重提。 2022年托儿所屠杀惨案后，泰国国会下议院就表示将探讨枪支管控和应对枪支暴力的短期和长期措施。然而，直至2023年5月大选，上届政府起草的枪支特赦法案也未能通过议会审议。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;新的枪支管控措施究竟能够取得多大成效，有专家并不看好。美国“外交学者”网站刊发评论文章称，短期的政策调整无法从根本上解决黑市枪支交易问题，泰国政府必须放弃容忍非法经济的自由放任心态。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;一位网友的吐槽，让我们得窥“相亲顾问”的话术与套路。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他某次接到某相亲网站的电话，让去聊聊他们的相亲服务。相亲顾问问清他是私企管理人，年收入40万+，有房有车无贷款后，推荐了标价7万的相亲服务，还挤兑他：对你这样的高收入人群来说，7万不算什么高价格，但是我们可以提供情感服务。然后从手机里调出两份掩盖了具体信息的简历，简历上都有一位美女的照片，告诉他，两位美女都付了N万的会员费，她们的要求和他的情况非常适合，只要他入会，立刻可以安排见面认识。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但他的心理价位是1万以下。他表示，7万对他来说是不能承受的价位。见他准备起身离开，相亲顾问用很不屑的口气说，“我们现在谈的是你的终生大事，如果你自己都觉得你连几万块都不值，那我们也无能为力。”相亲顾问还强调，“我们很多会员都交了一年十几万、几十万的会员费，我考虑到您的收入水平都没跟您提。”他回答，不认为自己的终生大事不值7万，只是觉得这种服务不值7万，至于十几万、几十万，除非XX才会花这种冤大头钱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;过了两天，相亲顾问给他打电话，用一种自来熟式的亲切话语说，如果7万一下子支付有点难以承受，网站可以提供分期付款和折扣，且推荐了其他套餐，但他直接挂了电话。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;类似的场景，媒体早有揭露：把目标对象关在屋里两三个小时的洗脑，要求交几万元的会员费；注册后，各种不同的号码打来骚扰电话；注册后邀请去线下门店，交了钱之后态度敷衍。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这位网友说，在他看来，花几万块钱买个相亲服务有点扯，直到他看见有人真的晒出3.2万的相亲服务账单，他才觉得自己见识短浅了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其实并非是他见识短浅，而是，在某些相亲网站强大的话术和定点轰炸式推销面前，终究有人敌不过。 2022年3月，澎湃新闻报道说，通过电话和微信，一自称来自“MarryU Club高端会员俱乐部”的婚恋中介持续向北京的郭女士推销“高端婚恋咨询服务”，并承诺在服务期内一定能帮她找到合适的对象。郭女士来到该平台一家线下实体加盟店，签订了一份期限480天、价值近17万元的会员服务合同和补充协议。约定由杭州某公司委托北京某咨询管理有限公司履行合约服务，承诺为郭女士提供定制版“猎婚服务”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;新闻报道告诉我们，女士这17万算是打了水漂。在后续服务过程中，郭女士发现，该平台提供约见的男士身份存疑，有的年龄、工作单位信息存在出入，有些见面后连微信或联系方式都没留，“即使加了，（对方）也没什么反应”。合同生效期间，郭女士在一次偶然的私人社交中结识了现在的丈夫，两人2021年12月领取结婚证。婚后，郭女士以为可以返还一定比例的服务费，但被婚介机构以违反合同约定“和非中介推荐候选人结婚”为由拒绝。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果你以为郭女士的遭遇只是一种偶然，那就大错特错了。数据显示，2019年上半年，聚投诉平台共受理全国消费者对婚恋交友行业有效投诉量1686件，当期确认投诉解决量993件，解决率58.9%。从投诉问题类型看，主要包括夸大服务效果、退款难等。说白了，某些相亲平台是在和你玩套路，其醉翁之意不在酒，在乎你的钱包。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在民间，长期以来，“媒妁之言”是小青年走到一起的牵动力。理论上说，相亲网站就是“虚拟媒人”，但现实之中，这个“虚拟媒人”却经常表现出和媒人功能相背离的特点。媒人的最大特点是凭借三寸不烂之舌尽快促成男女双方的姻缘，可是某些相亲网站恰恰相反，他们的核心诉求是尽力签长约，为此各种拖延、各种消耗，直至合约到期，赚得盆满钵满。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;交纳大笔会员费，目的是找到优质男女，但一个戳心的问题是，在某些相亲网站，真的有优质男女等着你，只要掏够钱就能找到合适对象吗？其实，只要捋一捋逻辑线，就可以知道答案。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现实中，优质男女早就被人抢得头破血流了，还需要上相亲平台？说某些平台优质男女大把抓，交钱后就是你的了，是来搞笑的吧？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;给相亲网站交会员费，本质上交的是中介费。但很多时候，这个中介费收得很奇怪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在房地产领域，中介尚有“行规”，房子买卖成交了才能收费，所以房产中介为尽力撮合双方达成交易。但某些相亲网站诱使求偶心切的男女掏出老本、对结果不负责任，居然可以持续生意兴隆、不愁客源，难道真的受益于“人傻钱多”？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很多相亲平台会员一掏就是几万、十几万甚至几十万，花的钱真不比买房中介费少——在这种婚恋市场所展现的“大宗交易”却充满了玄幻性和荒诞性。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;某些相亲平台大搞虚构画像、骗君入瓮、韭菜能割就多割的做法，卑鄙无耻透顶，却总能凭借一系列的误导术、风险化解术占上风，让很多消费者有苦难言。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;动不动和你谈钱的，不只是电诈分子，还可能是“相亲套路”者。认识到婚恋网站不太可能有优质男女，不太可能通过多花钱得到“更多”，不太可能拥有相亲顾问的“指导”就能所向披靡，这是必须掌握的常识。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“上网”找对象，当然有一定效果——事实上我有朋友就是在网上找到真爱的，但找对象是不是非得找某些“专业平台”不可？未必。前述郭女士签了约却在平台之外找到对的人，这个对平台打脸的“意外”充分说明，火热的生活场景才是感情的“孵化”基地。有时，找不到对象，不是因为你没进“专业平台”的门，而是因为你的有效社交圈子不够大，或者说，你对生活这片海所扎下的“猛子”还不够深。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;老家新盖了自建房，房间多，厕所也多，就没有一次性装修完成，我趁着电商的购物节购买了一个洗手间的浴室柜。这是我在网上查看了无数篇卫浴如何选择的帖子后下单的产品，快递到老家后，我预约了安装的师傅，中间没出什么岔子。唯一的问题来自我爸，他除了对这个价格表示不满，也对我发出了灵魂拷问：“为什么不去家附近的店里买？熟人，以后维修还方便。”这问题我答不上来，因为网购的原因是追求性价比，但我的价格在他面前毫无竞争力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;等我回到老家，我爸迫不及待把我带到他们使用的洗手间，让我猜眼前的这个浴室柜多少钱，我说猜不出来，“500块！”他带着一脸的骄傲，我甚至能看到他的内心独白：“看我是不是很厉害，什么网购，都是浮云！”他向我解释：“这是老板清仓的样品，被我带走了。”我当然清楚，啥都没有的三无产品和牌子货是不一样的，最直接的体现就是价格，但这个价格的低廉程度确实震惊到我了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;祸不单行，我回家使用几次新装的浴室柜后，发现水槽和水管接口处没有拧紧，会渗水滴到地面。家里没有六角扳手，我爸对我又是一顿冷嘲热讽，他的浴室柜、热水器出了什么问题，他出门走几百米就能叫人过来维修，而我只能自己想办法。于是，那个浴室柜至今还在渗水，水滴落到瓷砖上的声音就是我爸对我的控诉。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这么一看，实体店好像是依靠价格战打赢了网购，其实不是，只是我爸的消费观让他选择了低价的商品，实体店本质上还是依靠它可以触摸得到的售后获取消费者对它的依赖与信任。更绝的是，它还通过提供情绪价值来让用户埋单。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一个夏夜，父母出去逛街乘凉，回来的时候带了一台净水器以及一名工作人员，同时抱上楼的还有赠送的空气净化器和榨汁机。我担心俩老人家被骗，赶紧把我爸拖到一边询问他怎么回事。事情就是他们受到“蛊惑”，当机立断买了一台净水器，价格是5000元不到，还附加两个赠品。品牌是正规品牌，商店是正规商店，随行跟来的工作人员也穿着印有品牌logo的polo衫。我下意识用手机打开了该品牌的网店，寻找我爸买的型号，查询未果之后，咨询了线上客服，原来线上线下的款是不一样的。姑且算是没有买到假货吧，但看着那两个赠品，我知道肯定买贵了，羊毛出在羊身上的道理还不懂嘛。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我爸是会贪图小便宜的人，但购买净水器绝不是因为便宜或是为了那两个赠品，而是工作人员真的是会俘获人心。他们不是网络商城里用文字表示亲昵的机器人，那个来我家安装净水器的小哥，接触了一会儿，我想我可能也会忍不住为他掏钱。他在安装的过程中，一直耐心地为我父母讲解使用与维护的知识点，完成之后，并不急着走，而是打开了榨汁机的包装，演示使用方法。当时我就站在一旁，不用看说明书也知道榨汁机的操作，他完全可以离开下班了。但他找我妈要了香蕉和牛奶，放入杯体，摁下按钮，一边讲解一边操作，榨汁机发出电钻一般的声音，我父母静静站在他身旁，微笑注视着。榨汁结束，他倒了两杯递给我父母，三个人有说有笑，我在客厅的另一端，看着这一幕，感觉他们才是一家三口。你说，这钱掏得值不值？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这就是网购难以提供的情绪价值。除开一大批不会使用智能手机不会网购的中老年，还有一群人坚信实体店，坚信店里看得见摸得着的商品，以及面对面的销售人员才能带来安全感。电商经济如日中天，不少实体店却不仅活下来了，还活得不错。我想，这也是情感容易空虚的当代人的一点点需求，需要陪伴、需要慰藉、需要真实的触碰与面对面的交流，只有这样的关怀才会让冰冷的物质拥有了额外的价值，也才愿意为它埋单。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 5, 2023, the Swedish Academy awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature to Norwegian Drama Author Jon Foss, whose plays are the most performed of any contemporary European playwright. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 5, 2023, Mats Malm, the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, called Jorn ·Fosse, 64, was driving in the village of Bergen, a city on Norway&#39;s west coast, when he called. Fosse had been carefully preparing for this call for ten years—after all, he had been part of the hot debate about the Nobel Prize in Literature for ten years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I was surprised, but at the same time, in a sense, I wasn&#39;t,&quot; he told Swedish public broadcaster. Fosse promised to drive home carefully. He is the most famous living playwright in the contemporary era and his works have been performed the most. He also writes prose, novels, poetry, children&#39;s literature and translation works. His works have been translated into more than fifty languages. After receiving the Nobel Prize, he complained that there would be no more big prizes to win in the future, &quot;Everything will go downhill from now on!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jorn Fosse was born in 1959 in Haugesund, a small town on the west coast of Norway. De, who made his debut in 1983 with the novel &quot;Red, Black&quot;, began drama creation when he was around 35 years old and completed 40 plays including adaptations in 20 years. According to The New Yorker, after a very successful and busy period working almost exclusively as a playwright, in 2012 Fother converted to Catholicism, gave up drinking, remarried, and rarely wrote plays again, &quot;writing another The idea of ​​a script no longer entertains”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, John Fosse published his most important masterpiece of novels in recent years, &quot;September&quot;. This series of seven novels is written in the form of a monologue, nearly a thousand pages of stream-of-consciousness narration, with sentences never interrupted. According to the New Yorker, the narrator of &quot;Seven Parts&quot; is a painter named Asle, a convert to Catholicism who is mourning the death of his wife Ales. On Christmas Eve, Asler discovers his friend, a painter of the same name, unconscious in a Bergen alley, dying of alcohol poisoning. &quot;Their memories overlap, repeat, and gradually merge into A single voice, a vague consciousness capable of existing in many times and places simultaneously.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After winning the Nobel Prize, Fosse said in an interview that after completing &quot;Seven Parts&quot;, &quot;this announcement was expected to a certain extent.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fosse always insisted on writing in Nynorsk, a language spoken only in the western and central regions of southern Norway. Nynorsk, also known as New Norse, is a written language formed by a linguist who collected dialects from rural areas of Norway in the mid-19th century. Compared to Norway&#39;s other official language, written Norwegian, Nynorsk has a small footprint. In Norway, the first language in which students are taught is supposed to be decided by referendum in each school district, but as of 2016, only 12.2% of primary school students accepted Nynorsk as the main written language. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ninosk is a language that Fosse, who was born in the West Coast countryside, learned as a child. He attributed the award to the language itself, which he believed brought a sense of freshness. He is good at turning blank space and silence into speech, and even believes that &quot;Oriental audiences can best understand my works.&quot; Anders Olsen, chairman of the Nobel Prize Committee for Literature, mentioned in the Swedish Academy’s biography of Fosse that after completely simplifying the language and dramatic actions, Fosse used the simplest everyday language to touch human anxieties and emotions. uncertainty, and provide a profound experience of proximity to the divine. This brought him extraordinary public recognition and established him as a major innovator of contemporary theatre. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Anders listed several of Fosse&#39;s writing qualities. One of his key themes is to show, through minimalism and fragmentation, the harrowing transformations of critical moments of indecision. For example, a young mother left her apartment to take out the trash but locked herself out while her children were still inside. She needs to go get help but can&#39;t do that because she can&#39;t abandon her child. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Fosse presents situations that are immediately recognizable from our own daily lives.&quot; While in the 1995 play &quot;The Name,&quot; a pregnant young girl awaits the father of her unborn child, He was delayed. &quot;A tension is immediately built here due to this sense of uncertainty and the resulting fragmented sentences. Furthermore, these interruptions create a gap between the girl&#39;s desire for a new life with her child and her anxiety about being abandoned by her father Gully.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Death Variation,&quot; a one-act play about a suicidal girl, Fother tells the story backwards from the girl&#39;s death. It is written in brief, staccato language by six nameless people from different eras, both living and dead. The play ends with the girl giving a moving speech from the other side of the grave, expressing a fundamental uncertainty about whether her decision to end her life was the right one. Jon Fosse considers his writing difficult to categorize, &quot;You don&#39;t read my books for the plot. But it&#39;s not because I want to be an incomprehensible writer, I never try to write in a complicated way. I always It’s about writing in a simple and—I hope—profound way.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Anders Olsen is the chairman of the Nobel Prize Committee for Literature. After the 2023 Nobel Prize in Literature was announced, Anders Olson Si received an email from a Southern Weekend reporter as scheduled. He said he was happy to be interviewed and responded within a day. However, he remained tight-lipped on some issues, such as whether the jury&#39;s decision to award the award to Jon Fother went smoothly and whether there were any other strong contenders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following is an exclusive interview with Anders Olsen by a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;The strongest and deepest emotions are contained in silence and pauses&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style= &quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the past ten years, John Fosse has been regarded as a strong contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature. When did his name enter the Nobel committee&#39;s short list? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;For confidentiality reasons, I cannot answer this question. All I can say is that Fosse has been is a globally renowned author whose works have been widely translated since the 1990s and have been with us on the theater stage. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;On what writing qualities does the Swedish Academy pay attention to Jörn· Fother? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Fosse wrote in a wide range of fields. He was a playwright, novelist and poet, especially his scripts and long or short narratives capture our attention. But in all this he was a poet, as he preferred to be called. You can feel it in his language processing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What works of Jon Fother are the main basis for the award? work? Which work does the jury consider to be his most important work? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;We think (and Fox said so in the review) that after Fox completed his After releasing three volumes of his masterpiece, The Septology - a well-deserved achievement, this award couldn&#39;t come at a better time. This novel and more of his essays, and of course his highly innovative plays from the 1990s, are decisive for us. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From a personal perspective, you like him Which works? What strikes you most about his writing? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;He can make silences and pauses speak in the theater, and it is in silences and pauses that the strongest, The deepest emotion, that struck me. &quot;Somebody is going to come&quot;, &quot;Death Variations&quot; and &quot;Dream in Autumn&quot; are all wonderful plays. And in his prose, I was completely immersed in &quot;The Septology,&quot; but I especially loved &quot;Morning and Evening,&quot; a book about life written in sparkling and extremely sensitive prose. Short stories of coming and passing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“Give voices a special status”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family : Italics, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to Jon Fosse: &quot;His innovative drama and prose give voice to the ineffable.&quot; Where does the jury think his innovation lies? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Fosse is good at using silence, interruption and postponement of action to evoke deep anxiety in people. This is a striking feature of his drama. In his prose, his use of repetition and evocation is more typical. In both cases, something must be expressed that cannot be easily said. Fother does this in a very touching way. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The word voice in the award speech , also seems intended to emphasize Fother&#39;s contribution to literary language. How do you see the connection between Fosse&#39;s literary achievements and his use of the Nynorsk language? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This is the first Nynorsk-language writer to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. I think his work should be read in his native language if possible, it has an unpretentious beauty and is not difficult to translate. Compared to written Norwegian, Norway&#39;s other official language, Nynorsk is more traditional, less urban and more closely related to Old Norse. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You are reading the Nynorsk version ? Are there any good translations to recommend? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, I read Fosse in Nynorsk, and it is highly recommended. I don&#39;t have much experience with translations, and both Urban Andersson and Lars Andersson&#39;s Swedish translations are excellent. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How to understand the &quot;ineffable&quot; in Fosse&#39;s works What does it mean? He introduced his own writing ideas and quoted two sentences, one is Wittgenstein&#39;s &quot;Where there is no words, one must be silent&quot; and the other is Derrida&#39;s &quot;What cannot be said, one can only write&quot;. He thinks the latter is closer to his own ideas. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think both statements can be linked to Fosse&#39;s writing. In Wittgenstein&#39;s Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, &quot;unsayable&quot; refers to the realm where we cannot formulate propositions, and it is also the realm where we can call it &quot;true&quot;. But literature, ethics, and religion do not use propositions; they belong precisely to the realm of the unsayable. Derrida does not have the same strict standard of truth as Wittgenstein. On the contrary, his &quot;saying&quot; gives writing a special position, which coincides with Fosse. Paradoxically, Fother&#39;s writing gave voice a special status, especially in his dramatic works. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Eon Fother believes that he has the greatest influence His writers include Tarje Wessos, the Austrian poets Georg Trakl and Samuel Beckett, and the ones he most admires are Kafka and Knut. Knut Hamsun. How do you think these writers influenced him? What were Fosse&#39;s own innovations? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It’s hard to give a short answer. Fother has a negative worldview in the Gnostic sense (Gnostic (ancient Greek philosophy, which believes that the material world is evil and can only be saved through &quot;spiritual knowledge&quot;)), which is very close to Beckett. The most important thing is the use of negation and questions. Fosse&#39;s play bears a striking resemblance to Waiting for Godot, but this does not lead him to nihilism. There was in Fosse a faith that Beckett did not have and a kind of passive mysticism, like that of Meister Eckhart, which appears in the Heptalogy. 》 is very obvious. I won’t talk about other writers. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“It’s very difficult to give a great Fosse performance”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style= &quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You think the uniqueness of Fosse&#39;s writing lies in the fact that after completely simplifying language and dramatic actions, he uses simple daily life scenes to express human beings&#39; strongest anxiety and powerlessness. A lot of writers can do this, what’s so special about Fosse? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;A certain strange confidence, almost childlike self-confidence, and a gentle humor in the negativity. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the interview after the award, you said you were blessed Ser&#39;s work touches on common human &quot;anxieties, insecurities, and thoughts about life and death.&quot; This is easily reminiscent of the unease that pervades the world. Are there any practical considerations in awarding the award to Fosse at this time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;You are always influenced by what is happening in the contemporary world, but I don’t think it is the decisive factor. Fosse is always with us. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Have you seen his plays on stage? ’s performance? How is it different from reading a script? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It needs to be pointed out that Fosse&#39;s dramatic works are extremely readable. But this is not always the case. In addition, due to Fosse&#39;s special language and less stage scenery, it is very difficult to give a wonderful Fosse performance on the stage. Please read his work first and then perform your own mental show! &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why is the award given to a playwright? Although Jon Fosse is one of the most well-known playwrights in the contemporary theater world, compared with the popular candidates in the eyes of the outside world, such as Salman Rushdie and Margaret Atwood, this choice will not be the same. Will there be some niche? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;For us it is of course important to focus on drama. Harold Pinter received this honor over twenty years ago and I think now is the time. Interestingly, Fosse also translated Pinter&#39;s work. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In 2014, Fother accepted an interview with the British &quot;Guardian&quot; &quot;In an interview, he said that the Nobel Prize in Literature is usually awarded to very old writers. &quot;You will get it when it does not affect your writing.&quot; Coincidentally, Fosse rarely writes for the theater now. Last year, he told the New Yorker that he wanted to take a break after writing &quot;Seven Parts&quot; and that he is now very interested in literary translation. Does winning the award at this time confirm his previous views? Is this a &quot;lifetime achievement award&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think it can be regarded as a &quot;lifetime achievement award&quot;, just like Peter Handke (2019 Winner of the 2016 Nobel Prize for Literature) won the same award. Of course, this isn&#39;t always the case. In both cases, it is also important to note that they achieved great things before winning the award. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;This year Chinese writer Can Xue ranked in the British bookmaker Nicer It ranked first in the odds list on the Odds website, attracting enthusiastic attention from the Chinese people.

Recently, based on the remarkable results achieved in the previous work, the crackdown has achieved another major result. 497 telecommunications network fraud suspects were handed over to the Lincang Public Security Bureau in two batches, and 209 telecommunications network fraud suspects were handed over to the Pu&#39;er Public Security Bureau.

In order to continue to build momentum and advance the crackdown in depth, under the command and deployment of the Yunnan Provincial Public Security Department, the Pu&#39;er Public Security Bureau further expanded its results. 209 telecommunications network fraud suspects were successfully handed over to us on October 1. At the same time, Lincang Public Security Bureau&#39;s border police law enforcement cooperation has made significant progress. The relevant local law enforcement departments in Myanmar handed over 497 telecommunications network fraud suspects to us in two batches on September 25 and October 7 respectively.

After continuous and effective crackdowns, 2,317 suspects of telecommunications and cyber fraud in northern Myanmar have been successfully captured and handed over to us, including 23 behind-the-scenes &quot;financiers&quot;, organizational leaders and backbones, and 94 online fugitives, a powerful squeeze This has reduced the living space for overseas fraudsters, and the number of telecom network fraud cases across the country has recently shown a significant downward trend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The relevant person in charge of the public security agency stated that the telecommunications network fraud crimes involving China in northern Myanmar mainly involve fraud types such as bill rebates, fake online investment and financial management, fake reseller logistics customer service, fake online loans, etc. The general public is advised to be careful Be vigilant, enhance your ability to detect and prevent fraud, and beware of being deceived. The public security organs will continue to keep a close eye on telecom network fraud criminal groups in northern Myanmar, continue to deepen border police cooperation, continue to organize special crackdown operations, make every effort to clear out fraud dens, arrest fraud personnel in accordance with the law, continue to expand the results of operations, and resolutely protect the people.

I wrote an article about an interview with a girl who quoted a poem called &quot;The Book of Songs: Biyang&quot; to express her desire to work hard. But there is no poem called &quot;Beyond the Sun&quot; in the &quot;Book of Songs&quot;. The forged poem is all homophonic. It is written in seemingly elegant words, but when read out it is full of swear words. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This editor has probably not done any real interviews or face-to-face conversations. The swearing in this poem is so obvious that you can hear it right away. However, if you think of looking for materials in the Book of Songs, this idea is correct. The function of the &quot;Ode&quot; part in &quot;The Book of Songs&quot; is traditionally believed to be &quot;to describe the beauty and virtue, and to report success to the gods&quot;. Although the gods no longer believe in them today, the Book of Songs is still the highest example of how to declare success, speak solemnly but not rigidly, and be elegant but not pretentious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, although &quot;Beyond the Sun&quot; is fake, and it only plays homophonic jokes, it is not considered clever, and it is &quot;joking and sadizing&quot;. But the poem seems to mean one thing, but actually it means another thing. It is also within the cultural context represented by the Book of Songs. There are so-called &quot;changing style&quot; and &quot;changing elegance&quot; in &quot;The Book of Songs&quot;, which pays great attention to this technique. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Daya·Dang&quot; repeatedly emphasized, &quot;King Wen said to consult, and the daughter of the Yin Shang Dynasty was consulted.&quot; King Wen of Zhou couldn&#39;t help but sigh. What he sighed was the fate of the Shang Dynasty, and then he mentioned Shang Zhou in the poem. The various atrocities committed by the king were listed in detail and criticized repeatedly. The last sentence of the poem is the famous &quot;Yin Jian is not far away, in the time of Queen Xia&quot;. Shang Zhou wanted to know his own ending, and the mirror was at hand, it was Xia Jie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people have always emphasized that Shang Zhou was vilified by the Zhou people. The reason is that subsequent dynasties must vilify the previous dynasty&#39;s subjugated king, otherwise it will not be enough to establish their own legitimacy. It cannot be said that this reason does not exist, but the poem &quot;Dang&quot; was obviously not written for this purpose. This poem was written during the Western Zhou Dynasty. The author was clearly criticizing Shang Zhou, but his actual intention was to criticize King Li of Zhou. Firstly, the artillery fire was not directed at King Li of Zhou Dynasty, but was rebounded by Shang Zhou; secondly, it was not the poet who fired the artillery fire like this, but King Wen of Zhou Dynasty. The foundation of this dynasty was created by King Wen. As a descendant of King Wen, can you still oppose him? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Book of Songs&quot; initiated this tradition of borrowing from the past to satirize the present. Confucius especially emphasized to his disciples that they must study &quot;The Book of Songs&quot; carefully. Naturally, later generations of Confucian scholars played this trick very well. Why did Qin Shihuang burn poems and books? Just because &quot;Poetry&quot; is indeed an excellent teaching material that reflects the past and the present. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The author of &quot;Dang&quot; was probably an important minister in the Western Zhou Dynasty. Traditionally, it is believed that he was Duke Zhaomu who pointed out that &quot;it is better to guard against the people&#39;s mouth than to guard against the river&quot;. At least it is reasonable. Most people can&#39;t talk about such advanced topics, but they also have a technique for venting their resentment through poetry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Those who have not read &quot;The Book of Songs&quot; have probably heard that &quot;under the sky, is it the king&#39;s land, and on the shore of the land, is it the king&#39;s ministers&quot;, and then judging based on intuition, they will also think this sentence The majestic praise comes from the official propaganda of the Western Zhou Dynasty. It cannot be ruled out that this sentence was originally propaganda. However, we can read this sentence today because the author of &quot;Xiaoya·Beishan&quot; was a small civil servant in the Zhou Dynasty. These four sentences are followed by two sentences: &quot;Doctors are not equal.&quot; , I am engaged in being an independent scholar.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The six sentences strung together mean: The world is the king&#39;s land, and the land is the king&#39;s ministers. The leadership is really unfair, and the burden is heavy on me. ——Xian means more. It probably means that those who are capable work hard, and the boss assigned all the work to the author. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following section of &quot;Beishan&quot; elaborates on how uneven the work of this department is: some people &quot;sleep in bed&quot;, which is a more elegant way of saying &quot;lying down&quot;; some people &quot;don&#39;t know how to call&quot; , no matter how miserable the people are, it’s none of my business, I’ll just do it if I can; some people are “Qi Chi Yan Yang” and will definitely be late for work and will definitely leave early after work; some people are “Zhan Le Drinker” and indulge in drinking and having fun; &quot;Come in and out of the discussion&quot;, and the reason for going to work is to talk loudly. If there are more people like this, the work will naturally be particularly miserable. He &quot;does not do anything extravagantly&quot; and is &quot;miserably afraid of blame.&quot; The more he does, the more blame he will bear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This poem pursues the effect of a majestic slogan that seamlessly connects with the fly camp and the dog dog below. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you turn two pages back in &quot;Beishan&quot;, you will read another song called &quot;Xiao Ming&quot;. ——There is a poem in &quot;The Book of Songs·Daya&quot;, the first sentence is &quot;Mingming is down&quot;, and there is a poem in &quot;Xiaoya&quot;, the first sentence is &quot;Mingming is going to heaven&quot;. So the song in &quot;Daya&quot; is called &quot;Da Ming&quot;, and the song in &quot;Xiao Ya&quot; is called &quot;Xiao Ming&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiao Ming said: &quot;I have passed away in the past, and the sun and the moon are gone. Will the clouds return? There will be no clouds in the year.&quot; I came to work after the Chinese New Year. When can I go home? In the blink of an eye. It&#39;s the end of the year. &quot;I miss me alone, and I am a common man. I am worried, and I am afraid that I will not have enough time.&quot; I miss me alone, and the more things I do, the more busy I am. I feel really sad, and I am afraid that I will never be able to finish my work. &quot;Thinking of our common people, caring deeply for them! Don&#39;t you want to return home? I&#39;m afraid of the punishment and anger.&quot; I miss my family, I really do. &quot;Don&#39;t you want to return home? I&#39;m afraid of this wrath.&quot; Does it mean that I don&#39;t want to go home? I&#39;m afraid of being scolded by my boss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last chapter of &quot;Xiao Ming&quot; especially demonstrates the skill of converting grievances into official language:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Sigh, gentlemen, I will never rest in peace.&quot; In fact, it is talking about you stewards Yeah, don&#39;t get too comfortable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Jing shares your position&quot;, please stay in your position. The implication is that when I report the work and ask you to make a decision, don&#39;t be unable to find someone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The good thing is integrity.&quot; You have to be an upright person. In fact, it means being a kind person and approving what should be approved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;God listens to you, and you will be blessed.&quot; God is also watching you. Don&#39;t make things difficult for others, and you will be rewarded with blessings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Well, after more than two thousand years, Xiao Ming is still Xiao Ming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
