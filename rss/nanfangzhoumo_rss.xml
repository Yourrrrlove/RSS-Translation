On September 12, a parent of a young child in Shanghai posted a message: On March 24 this year, parents found injuries on their child who was studying at the Dahua Tadpole Music Park in Baoshan District, Shanghai, and suspected that the kindergarten teacher had abused the child. On March 27, the parents called the police, and the police issued an injury examination form for the child to go to the hospital for examination. &quot;The police issued an injury examination form to check the child&#39;s injuries that day because there were many bruises on his body. In the next few days, the police issued an injury examination form again.&quot; , doctors at the Children’s Hospital found multiple pinpoint-like holes.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The hospital injury examination sheet uploaded by the parent showed that there were many pinpoint-like holes on the toddler&#39;s body. &quot;The parents immediately asked for a hair test. The results showed that all five children contained ephedrine, two of them.&quot; Child contains lidocaine&quot;. &quot;It has been more than half a year since the case was reported. Parents have suffered a lot. They have suffered from insomnia and nightmares. We just want to know the truth! What have the children experienced? What have they endured? What will happen to their physical condition in the future?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;On September 13, a reporter from Dawan News called Dahua Tadpole Music Park. The kindergarten replied: &quot;You can go to the police station and they can give you the most correct answer, or the answer you want most.&quot; &quot;All our processes They all follow the arrangements of the Education Bureau and the police station.&quot; Subsequently, the reporter called the local police, but there was no reply; when calling the Baoshan District Education Bureau, a staff member said: &quot;We as a whole attach great importance to this matter and have been following up and handling it. We have also seen the content posted by parents on the Internet.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Half a year has passed for such an abominable and suspected criminal incident, and there is neither any explanation nor any explanation as to whether the perpetrators have been dealt with. Below, it’s no wonder that parents are reluctant to give up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the nature of this matter is vile, and the relevant circumstances are outrageous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the injury examination notice from the Shanghai Public Security Bureau uploaded by the parents, the parents stated that the boy was only four years old. The day before he was admitted to the hospital, the parents found a suspicious pinpoint-like hole. After asking the child, they learned that &quot;maybe There is abuse or use in clinical trials.&quot; On that day, fever symptoms appeared, with the highest temperature being 39 degrees; the test results were: &quot;Stomach and energy have become worse than before, there is tenderness in the penis and scrotum, and repeated swelling and pain.&quot; &quot;It&#39;s all because you have a little more. It looks like a needle-like hole, and some of it has healed. &quot;There are also many needle-like holes in the penis and scrotum.&quot; The test conclusion is: &quot;The scrotum is red, swollen, and tender.&quot; &quot;There are many suspicious needle-like holes all over the body. The purpose is unknown. The police need to be called.&quot; Collaborative treatment.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The parent said: &quot;All five children contained ephedrine (in their hair), and two of them contained lidocaine.&quot; If what is said is true, it would be even more terrifying. Because ephedrine has central nervous system stimulant effects, it is a drug-making raw material strictly controlled by the government. Lidocaine is a local anesthetic. Think about it, everyone. Even when you go to a pharmacy to buy pseudoephedrine, a drug that relieves cold symptoms, you have to buy it in limited quantities and register your ID number. Where did the perpetrators get these drugs? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are more questions: Are these &quot;needle-like holes&quot; just a needle stick in the child, or are they the marks left by using a syringe to inject ephedrine and lidocaine? For such a long period of time, many children have been systematically injected with acupuncture, ephedrine and lidocaine. Is it a crime committed by one person, or is it a coordinated crime by many people? Where is the perpetrator now? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not the first time a kindergarten teacher stabbed a child with a needle. Similar incidents have been exposed many times and occur all over the country. Therefore, we must consider the possibility of imitating crimes and abetting crimes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In November 2019, the Tianjin Binhai New District Court held the first public hearing on the case of two middle five teachers of the Golden Cradle Dongcheng Kindergarten suspected of abusing their care recipients. The prosecutor alleged: From July to October 2018, the defendants Zhao and Dou, as kindergarten teachers in the fifth class of Tianjin Golden Cradle Dongcheng Kindergarten, resorted to needle sticks, pushing, and The children in care were abused by pulling and other violent behaviors, and the number of victims was as many as 24. Two kindergarten teachers were sentenced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2020, a mother’s 3-year-old daughter was in the middle class at Chuntian Huahua Kindergarten in Dachang Kulun Village, Saihan District, Hohhot City. One day she overheard her daughter saying that Teacher Guo from the kindergarten pricked someone with a needle. Later, I discovered that there were scabs that looked like needle holes on my daughter’s body, head, ring finger, armpits, thighs, ankles, etc. Two other parents also found scabs on their children that looked like needle holes. The kindergarten was later closed down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with these cases, the case in Baoshan District, Shanghai was even more egregious in nature, going beyond the scope of general abuse, with obvious intentions and consequences of personal injury. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the perpetrator’s motive is worth exploring. There is always a motive for abusing or physically harming a child: feeling that the child is disobedient and disobeying management is one kind; having conflicts with parents and being angry at the child is another kind; being driven by distorted values ​​​​and crazy hatred is also another kind. kind. The last one is probably the scariest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kindergarten should be a place where children live, play and play together. It should be a place of relaxation, freedom and safety, like a sweet dream. Kindergarten teachers should love children and care for each child as their own. Having normal values, loving children, and being patient are the minimum requirements for a kindergarten teacher. If a seemingly normal face hides disgust and hatred for children, then the kindergarten will not only not be a warm and loving paradise, but will become a chilling nightmare. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, especially in first-tier cities, kindergartens generally charge a lot of money. From the perspective of professional ethics, how can we take money from parents and turn away, close the door, abuse, and harm children like angels? Such evil behavior not only breaks through the bottom line of professional ethics, but also represents the degradation and loss of human nature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a thorough investigation and examination of the perpetrator&#39;s life world and spiritual world to see who the perpetrator usually associates with, what content he follows on social platforms, celebrities and himself. Media, which groups and circles to join, and see if this person and the online and offline circles he interacts with have any extreme remarks, actions or even organizations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, it is necessary to install monitoring equipment in kindergartens across the country. In principle, all activities of children and all interactions between teachers and children should be recorded on video to deter those treacherous people who hold distorted values. ; At the same time, kindergarten teachers and early childhood staff who are entering and working should review their social media, speech and values, and keep those who hold distorted values ​​away from children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 17 Sep 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[若尔盖：黄河在这“美丽回眸”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256735]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-17 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 17 Sep 2023 13:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[北京跳水大爷：只愿安静跳水，不想当网红]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256880]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-17 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/16/oSNiAIUiesQ3CdeH1EU5tDMMXBURE0EqlI2luCci.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/oSNiAIUiesQ3CdeH1EU5tDMMXBURE0EqlI2luCci. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251000&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Beijing middle-aged and elderly diving team coach Meng Derui participated in the training&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa ;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;1, 2, 3, jump!&quot; Coach Meng Derui gave the order, and more than a dozen adults and aunts in swimsuits jumped into the water from left to right, splashing everywhere. splash. &quot;Someone jumped, let&#39;s do it again.&quot; Coach Meng was in second place, and he heard that the rhythm of entering the water behind him was wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the Beijing middle-aged and elderly diving team (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Diving Team&quot;) rehearsing the collective Solitaire &quot;Domino&quot; jump in the South Moat on September 13. Every day at two o&#39;clock in the afternoon, this group of 60 and 70-year-old people come here from all directions to participate in &quot;training&quot;. They perform tuck-knee pose, swallow pose, back swallow pose, front and back somersaults...all of them are as strong as swallows. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/bh6tdihLgJ4TKcokF7joxNK1UjEYP0VgaIARgKCC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/bh6tdihLgJ4TKcokF7joxNK1UjEYP0VgaIARgKCC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251009&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Between training sessions, the team members rested by the river&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http: //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/AszaMg9utuc90L8NV6qbeO7qdiwcX63odawBLdio.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/AszaMg9utuc90L8NV6qbeO7qdiwcX63odawBLdio.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251010&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Training is over , Zhang Yuan rode an electric bike home &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After getting out of the water, water droplets lay on her wheat-colored skin, which was particularly bright under the sun. . Although the team has been established for less than three years, most of the team members have 20 to 30 years of winter swimming or diving experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the personal training session, Coach Meng completed a set of backward somersault half-circle pike jumps. &quot;201B, performance level, so exciting,&quot; teammates and passing spectators clapped and praised. Applause and laughter continued on the shore - some applauded, and some who failed the jump were heckled and joked, &quot;Isn&#39;t this shot painful enough?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;You see, everyone is laughing so hard Damn it, everyone is here just to have fun.&quot; Mengdry said while looking at his teammates. This 67-year-old Beijinger grew up in the alleys of Di&#39;anmen. He remembered two very happy things when he was a child. One was flying a kite on the tiles of a bungalow, and the other was swimming in Shicha Sea. In the 1960s, Meng Derui, who was in primary school, studied diving at the Shichahai Sports School. His coach later went abroad to teach and also brought out world diving champions. Because of his professional background and his friendly nature, the team members affectionately called him &quot;Meng Jiao&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“For every new pose, Meng Jiao explained the movements to us from head to toe and gave us personal demonstrations. No matter how cold the weather was, he could do a standard demonstration when he climbed on the platform. In his Under the leadership of the diving team, we adults have moved from a group of diving bastards to a quasi-professional level,&quot; said 62-year-old team member Zhang Yu&#39;an. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/hNnyjNZ6cmIAkejHTQVnUPMiSBtppnwc8nWRMZAn.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/hNnyjNZ6cmIAkejHTQVnUPMiSBtppnwc8nWRMZAn.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251002&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The team members rehearse the collective Solitaire &quot;Domino&quot; jump&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Don’t want to take risks Risking your life to become an Internet celebrity&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On September 3, 2023, Meng Jiao led the diving team to Tianjin to socialize with local diving friends. At that time, the diving master of Tianjin Lion Forest Bridge was popular all over the world. net. Some netizens posted a video of the team members arriving in Tianjin online with the title &quot;Beijing Diving Master Comes to Tianjin to Play Gym&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Actually, it’s not a competition at all, but an exchange and learning between diving friends. We have known each other for many years and are very familiar with each other. We go there to dive there every year because there are more suitable venues for high school students in Tianjin. The environment for bridge diving - the water is deep, the bridge is high, and the water bottom is clean.&quot; Zhang Yu&#39;an introduced, &quot;Like the Beijing South Moat where we train daily, the water depth is about 3 meters, and the bridge deck is 5 meters away from the water. For safety reasons, law enforcement officers do not allow us to To jump from the bridge, you can only jump from the guardrail on the shore, the height is only 2 meters.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first stop in Tianjin is the Chifeng Bridge, which is more than 9 meters high. Wang Tieshun, the &quot;Ironman of Winter Swimming&quot; in the team, was the first to take the stage. In his first jump, the &quot;Reverse Swallow&quot;, his buttocks touched the water first, and he was slapped hard, which was not ideal. He analyzed that it was due to the increase in height that there was a problem with the angle of entering the water. He immediately adjusted his posture when entering the water, and performed a wonderful dance afterwards, which won bursts of applause. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Brother Wang is 69 years old. Generally, when a person of this age stands at a height of 9 meters and looks down, his legs will tremble. Not only does he dare to jump, but he is also a &quot;anti-Yan&quot; who is cool and neat, so generous. People are impressed.&quot; Zhang Yu&#39;an said as he opened his arms in a &quot;swallow pose&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second stop was the &quot;8A-level scenic spot&quot; Lion Forest Bridge. The deck of the Lion Grove Bridge is about 6 meters above the water surface, which is an ideal height for high bridge diving. The team members just skipped here three months ago and it was a great experience. But at this time, there were already a sea of ​​people on and off the bridge, and the scene was very chaotic. Those who could jump and those who couldn&#39;t jump plunged into the water. Meng Derui saw a man walking into the water with his child in his arms, and he still has lingering fears. For safety reasons, he decided to lead his team members to evacuate immediately without jumping. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/dMWAFSXngM0yU1bzVOLoG9MmUPiayHBiK0aSZBd5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;654&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/dMWAFSXngM0yU1bzVOLoG9MmUPiayHBiK0aSZBd5.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251007&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Between training sessions, the team members rested by the river&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http: //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/KjcsCzMDg3BfwG13tlQPy8yejaaTwNvK3b2PsvTl.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/KjcsCzMDg3BfwG13tlQPy8yejaaTwNvK3b2PsvTl.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251008&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;After training , the brothers went to a nearby restaurant to have a drink&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Someone at the scene recognized that we were from Beijing and chased us all the way. We were following the filming, but we still withdrew. Everyone comes to dive for physical and mental pleasure and to improve their skills. They don’t want to risk their lives to become an Internet celebrity and be in the limelight.&quot; Zhang Yuan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Changluo, director of the emergency department of Changsha Central Hospital, said in an interview with the media that high-bridge diving is very dangerous, and it is easy to get injured if you blindly try it without professional guidance. In addition to damage to the retina, head and cervical spine, if the diving posture is incorrect and the abdomen falls into the water first, the impact may damage the internal organs, or even cause fatal consequences such as spleen rupture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another risk comes from the complex and unpredictable underwater conditions of natural waters. Every time the diving team arrives at a new water area, they will send members to go into the water first to survey - how deep is the water and whether there are large rocks or sharp foreign objects. Wang Tieshun once found a shared bicycle and several broken beer bottles underwater. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Safety is the most important thing for the diving team. In addition to their own safety, there is also the safety of others. Some young people passing by also want to dive with the old men on a whim. &quot;When encountering this situation, we will first dissuade them - if you haven&#39;t practiced before, don&#39;t jump blindly. If you jump, we will also remind you: the water depth here is not enough. If your head enters the water, you must raise your head in time, otherwise it will be easy to poke vertically to the bottom of the water.&quot; Meng Meng and his team members have encountered many such young people. Some of them couldn&#39;t wait to take off their clothes and shoes, and shouted to plunge into the water. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/AszaMg9utuc90L8NV6qbeO7qdiwcX63odawBLdio.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/AszaMg9utuc90L8NV6qbeO7qdiwcX63odawBLdio.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251010&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;After the training, Zhang Yuan rode his electric bike home&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Over the years, the team members We have rescued many people who accidentally drowned. &quot;Especially in the summer of 2023, which was extremely hot, more people came to swim than in previous years. Many delivery boys came here to take a shower. They parked their cars on the shore, took off their riding clothes, and plunged in. After a while, He was dangling in the water, and when we found out, we quickly swam over and pulled him ashore,&quot; Wang Tieshun said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/H4WW5WV1eLaFoXBHmyfeNUZIaWQZ76n9Dtjaq6aI.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/H4WW5WV1eLaFoXBHmyfeNUZIaWQZ76n9Dtjaq6aI.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251001&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the 1990s, Meng Derui participated in the New Year diving event at Xinjiekou Gap&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt; /p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The fun and hidden dangers of natural waters&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;For adults and adults, on the premise of ensuring safety, the fun of swimming in natural waters is something that cannot be achieved in indoor swimming pools. Comparable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the view is wide and there are few people. You can enjoy the natural scenery while swimming. Secondly, there is the water quality. Many adults said that they cannot stand the smell of disinfected water in indoor swimming pools, which &quot;makes their brains hurt.&quot; Natural waters like the South Moat are treated gray water, which is safe and odorless. Of course, there are also economic reasons. A swim in an indoor swimming pool costs at least dozens of yuan, and you only need to prepare a pair of swimming trunks in natural waters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, as Beijing’s water ecological environment has gradually improved, the water affairs department has continued to increase the openness and sharing of river and lake spaces to meet citizens’ water-related needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About two years ago, a group of swimming enthusiasts that Zhang Yuan belongs to forwarded eight officially opened natural water swimming spots in Beijing, including Beijing Bay Sunken Square, Dongzhimen Triangle, and Yongyin Canal 8.

However, due to safety concerns, relevant managers will dissuade you from doing so. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/aFL7XoG9cTQG7jiw1Edj0Za0VkTsmQItjeRiB9FN.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;655&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/aFL7XoG9cTQG7jiw1Edj0Za0VkTsmQItjeRiB9FN.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251005&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Every afternoon, the Beijing middle-aged and elderly diving team will train on the bank of the South Moat&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/ql42WDKHFJS2FgkxK8WwWdWX82ooZHVXdh6swzDp.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src= &quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/ql42WDKHFJS2FgkxK8WwWdWX82ooZHVXdh6swzDp.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251006&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align : center;&quot;>;The two movable jumping platforms currently used by the team members are made by Wang Tieshun, which is safe, easy to move without damaging the guardrails&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;&quot;Some managers are afraid of being held responsible for accidents, so they set up obstacles and prevent swimming in legal natural waters. We have our own ideas about this. Many of us have been swimming our whole lives, and we often travel in groups. How could something happen so easily? Among our team members, there are quite a few people who have rescued people who slipped and fell into the water, accidentally drowned, and committed suicide. Without daily outdoor exercise, how could we have the ability and physique to save people?&quot; Zhang Yu&#39;an hopes to pay attention to nature. The management of water activities in water areas should not be “one size fits all”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As evening approached, Mr. Li, who lived nearby, took his children to the river to swim. The family had just moved to Dongcheng District for the purpose of studying for their children. One day I was riding by here and saw people swimming and diving in the river. The children also wanted to try it. Now they can&#39;t wait to come here to play in the water every day after school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“For children, this kind of natural water area is definitely much better than the experience in an indoor swimming pool. You can have more fun here. Diving is not allowed in the indoor swimming pool, and you cannot change swimming lanes at will, because it will It affects other people.&quot; Mr. Li was a little concerned about the water quality at first, but the children swam for more than half a month and felt fine. &quot;The water quality here may have a higher microbial content, and the residual chlorine and urea in the swimming pool may be higher. . Chlorine is very harmful to the respiratory tract, especially children. If you keep swimming in it, there may be some potential harm.

Other children were happily playing pinball and shooting cigarette cases after school, but he could only go to training hard. &quot;Although I was in the amateur team at the time, the training was very strict. A group of 10 jumps for each movement was counted, and five or six groups had to be danced in half a day. Basic skills such as leg presses and shoulder presses were interspersed in between. The coach was also very strict, and the movements were not up to standard. Just hit the bottom of the shoe.&quot; Meng Derui has a family with many children, and he is the sixth child. His family sent him to a sports school just to have a free place to take care of him and to exercise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meng Derui loves water by nature. He feels a sense of excitement when standing on the diving platform, and it is indescribable satisfaction when he jumps into the water. Later, when he went to the mountains and countryside, he took advantage of his lunch break to go to a nearby reservoir to continue practicing. After returning to Beijing for work, after dinner, I rode my bicycle to a bridge at Xinjiekou Gap to dive. On weekends or holidays, go dancing on the high platform of the outdoor swimming pool in Gongti or Taoranting Park. It costs 10 cents for two hours. At this time, there is no urging from the coach, but an inner need - when diving, you must concentrate on thinking about the movements and not have distracting thoughts, so that you can forget a lot of &quot;messy things&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After retiring, Mengdry helped take care of his grandson. Sometimes when he did not come to training in the afternoon, his teammates knew that he must have gone to pick up his grandson. &quot;At home, it&#39;s all about fulfilling obligations, being tired and worrying. Coming here to dive with everyone is the most relaxing and joyful thing of the day,&quot; Mengdry called it a &quot;spiritual relief.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the training, the team members shared their fruits, and the brothers occasionally met up to have a drink. If a team member has a birthday or someone’s grandchild is one month old, they have to find a place to celebrate together. Not long ago, Meng Jiao&#39;s wife broke her foot. Zhang Yu&#39;an immediately sent his unused wheelchair to his home and accompanied him to the hospital. Several teammates went to visit his home. &quot;The relationship between our teammates is closer than that of real brothers.&quot; Mengdry sighed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/z2NcSoDaw1hiTgi3EsZx3v8RhVr4sY7tNJzjNbAP.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/z2NcSoDaw1hiTgi3EsZx3v8RhVr4sY7tNJzjNbAP.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251004&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Meng Derui participated in the training&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Yuan had many hobbies when he was young and studied art and decoration in his spare time , photography and design. In terms of sports, he is involved in skating, skiing, swimming, diving, cycling, running, and mountain climbing. He knows that he is not good at everything but enjoys the process and joy of learning and mastering each sport. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After retiring, Zhang Yuan got acquainted with Meng Jiao and these like-minded teammates, and concentrated his energy on diving, almost without landing for three years. He felt physically stronger and more energetic than before. &quot;We seniors in our 60s have a very simple idea: move more, exercise more, get sick less, and put less burden on the country and our children.&quot; Zhang Yu&#39;an has many dancing friends around him, and many years of chronic diseases such as high blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, and arthritis have passed. Keep exercising and get effective control. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/AVhTcMPwnKlEGr8nImBensbQkNmV3Oanyl2i1hmJ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/AVhTcMPwnKlEGr8nImBensbQkNmV3Oanyl2i1hmJ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251011&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;After training, Wang Tieshun rinsed his body with his own water.

Died of sudden illness. After hearing this, the team members expressed their regrets. Zhang Yuan had his own thoughts: &quot;It is very sad that such an accident happened. But I think this old man died very happily and could immerse himself in his lifelong hobby at the last moment of his life. In this way Leaving silently is much better than struggling in the hospital bed.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 17 Sep 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[和心智障碍者成为同事]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256538]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-17 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Nervous and scared, I pushed open the door of the factory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether they will suddenly yell or rush to attack others, I don’t know. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I walked forward cautiously, and no colleagues with mental disabilities showed up. Don’t ever encounter it, I thought silently in my heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Pap tap tap~&quot; came the sound of footsteps going down the stairs, and around the corner I met the first colleague with a mental disability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The girl, with her high ponytails, smiling, with bright eyes, raised her hands and shook them at me, &quot;Sister...Hello, sister!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This It was an opening that I had anticipated a lot in advance but didn’t expect. I didn&#39;t know how to respond to her enthusiasm, so I forced a smile on my tight face, said &quot;Hello&quot;, and turned around to go upstairs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Who knew that this girl was just here to lead the &quot;warm greeting army&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was catching up with my colleagues with mental disabilities in the factory who had changed into work clothes and went downstairs to do morning exercises. As they filed out, each one of them greeted me: some stopped and stood to say good morning to me. ; Some ran past me quickly, leaving echoes of hello drifting through my ears; others slowly walked downstairs, shyly saying good morning to me... The nervousness turned into surprise, and I suddenly Time just smiles and nods and says &quot;hello&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When they finished walking, the stairwell became quiet again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether they will suddenly yell or rush to attack others remains to be seen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I felt their outpouring of enthusiasm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As I walked up the stairs, there were pictures of them hanging on one side of the wall: profiles of employees working hard; employees participating in events; female employees dressed beautifully for Women’s Day... They seemed to be telling me: look! I&#39;m not dangerous, I can work, I can be beautiful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After completing the entry procedures, the ordinary employees of the factory began to introduce me to the basic information of the entire factory and so on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I walked into the production workshop. Every colleague with mental disabilities was working seriously at his or her position. There was only the sound of the machine and the trainer&#39;s voice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They are engaged in some simple assembly and sorting work, which is boring, but they enjoy it very much. On my first day here, I heard that one of my colleagues with mental disabilities was called the &quot;Clamp King&quot; because of his excellent work on clamps. This resounding name was well known in the factory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The factory is very user-friendly and will arrange work according to their characteristics and provide them with some auxiliary tools to help them complete their work more efficiently. For example, when sorting two types of parts, one large and one small, because the difference is very small, the factory will use a 3D printer to make a slot into which one type of part can be placed, so that colleagues with mental disabilities can tell which type of part it is by placing it. As I got familiar with the factory, I secretly admired it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During lunch, the employees lined up in an orderly manner when they heard the lunch bell and walked to the dining area carrying their plates. After I sat down, an employee sat next to me and started some conversation: Hello, sister, what is your name? My name is so-and-so, sister, are you here to work? Sister, you look so beautiful today. Sister, where are you from? … They spoke a little slowly and maybe a little unclear, but they were very polite. What surprised me most was that the girl with the twin tails said to me after finishing the meal: “Sister, I’ll eat and leave first, please take your time.” &quot;Then he picked up his dinner plate, wiped the table clean with paper, pushed the chair under the table, and left. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They would sing their favorite songs in the lounge during lunch break, mostly catchy old songs. Some people sang seriously, some interrupted and made trouble, some sat quietly by the window and watched the scenery... The work bell rang, and they returned to work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They will not shout suddenly or rush to attack others. Observation is over. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later I was chatting with others that I was interning in a factory where people with mental disabilities were the main people. Others looked at me strangely: Can these people also work? Is it a welfare institution organized by the government? Before actually entering this workshop, I also had this &quot;strange vision&quot;. However, after truly understanding it, I realized that there is light and love here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Be civilized and polite, they are the best practitioners of this slogan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a graduate student majoring in journalism and communication)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot; >;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The &quot;hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of Southern Weekend App is looking forward to your contributions.

However, in recent years, various routines and suspected cases of &quot;pig killing plate&quot; have occurred frequently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Beijing Business Daily&quot; reported in April this year that Ms. Zhang spent 20,000 yuan on Baihe.com to purchase a &quot;marriage insurance&quot; matchmaking service. The &quot;matchmaker&quot; who matched the service said that she would introduce high-quality men to her, and then successively Recommended 5 men. Ms. Chen mentioned that the five men did not express sufficient communication intentions, did not introduce themselves, and could not confirm the personal information mentioned by the &quot;matchmaker.&quot; Yuyao (pseudonym), who purchased a matchmaking service at Century Jiayuan’s Beijing Anzhen store, also revealed that she signed a contract and paid nearly 100,000 yuan. The store staff promised Yuyao that they would introduce “high-quality men” and “guaranteed success.” After Yuyao connected with several male users, none of them established a relationship between male and female friends. The two women asked for a refund because they were dissatisfied with the services of the dating website, but the other party had to deduct high fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Online social networking is a loose and progressive dating model, but the services provided by dating websites are very purposeful. Men and women who register as members or even purchase paid services have clear demands for marriage and love, and they hope to pass them. Dating and dating websites find people who match their own requirements and have corresponding expectations and measurement standards in terms of appearance, income, position, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mating and dating websites will provide two services for this type of men and women. One is a free registration service. After the user registers, they will &quot;audition&quot; for opposite-sex users who are also registered on the website to find those who meet the conditions and can communicate with each other. of opposite-sex communication. However, this method is inefficient and consumes a lot of time and energy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to save screening costs and improve success rate and safety, some consumers choose paid services provided by dating websites. In this regard, marriage and love websites provide &quot;offline matchmaker&quot; services, which are divided into telephone customer service and emotional consultants. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, a reporter from The Paper applied for a job and went undercover to enter an offline store of Jiayuan Online. After the short-term training, the store opened back-end permissions for reporters. Through the back-end, they can view the personal information of registered members of Century Jiayuan.com, including the user&#39;s browsing history and chat history. After obtaining the user&#39;s &quot;big data&quot;, the telephone customer service invites the user to the store for an interview through phone calls, text messages, etc. The reporter inquired about the statistics on the number of calls in the background of the system and found that most of the store&#39;s sales made an average of about 100 calls per day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When a customer comes to the store, the emotional consultant responsible for the interview will use words to guide, for example, &quot;Compared with buying a commercial house worth millions or tens of millions, it is better to spend tens of thousands of dollars to find your lover.&quot; &quot;It&#39;s worth it&quot;, and then displays the high-quality candidate information it has to induce users to sign up and pay. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Paper reported: In 2017, Liu Gang, a consumer who had used the &quot;matchmaker one-on-one&quot; service, said that online membership fees are relatively low, and members are charged for sending and viewing messages, and users also pay more every year. It only costs a few hundred yuan in membership fees. Prices for high-end services range from 10,000 to hundreds of thousands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why do so many people fall into this trap? The supply and demand relationship in the marriage market also plays a driving role. Century Jiayuan has not announced the proportion of male and female paid members, but Ideal Island VIP, known as the &quot;Master and Doctoral Dating Platform&quot;, released the &quot;2023 Ideal Island VIP User Report&quot; stating that 40.2% of Ideal Island VIP users are men and 59.8% are women. Among them, women account for more than 60% of users in Shanghai, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Beijing, and Shenzhen. It is reported that after becoming the VIP of Ideal Island and searching for the opposite sex, if you need to initiate an exchange WeChat application, you need to pay to purchase a membership. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a phenomenon of &quot;more boys and girls&quot; among users of dating websites, or it may be because men often bear the majority of dating expenses for both parties during the relationship, especially men at the bottom of the class who have to pay betrothal gifts when they get married. For the decision-making process of purchasing paid dating services More cautious. Some women consider more based on their age, partner&#39;s income, occupation, etc., and the need to find high-quality men through paid services is more urgent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to understand why female users are more likely to be deceived among the various service traps designed by dating websites. In 2021, Zhejiang Radio and Television&#39;s &quot;Xiaoqiang Online&quot; column reported that Ms. Lu, a Hangzhou citizen, registered as a member of Century Jiayuan in November 2019 and wanted to find a suitable partner. For this reason, she did not hesitate to borrow more than 130,000 yuan to pay the membership fee, because the contract stipulated that as long as she registered for marriage with the person recommended by the matchmaker during the contract period, the membership fee could be returned in full. However, after signing the contract, the candidates recommended by the matchmaker often did not meet Ms. Lu&#39;s standards, and Ms. Lu eventually requested a full refund. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the recommended products not matching the previous promises, some users have also encountered suspected &quot;marriage trusteeship&quot; incidents. The Beijing News reported in 2017 that Xiaoqing, who had worked at Zhenai.com and Jiayuan for two years, said that marriage entrustments were common. Some sales matchmakers think that this member is useless, or that the conditions required are difficult to find, so the matchmaker will introduce their people to the other party and make it clear that they cannot establish a relationship, but just gather the number of people and go through the motions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen from the above incidents that the promises of &quot;full refund on scheduled marriage&quot; and &quot;marriage insurance&quot; services of dating websites are all based on so-called back-and-forth promises to allow female users to fall into their serial routine—— Brainwashing them with words to induce them to pay, and pretending to be a high-quality man as a &quot;marriage agency&quot; during the meeting. Although as early as 2017, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and the National Health and Family Planning Commission formulated and issued the &quot;Guiding Opinions on Further Improving Youth Marriage and Love Work&quot;, requiring the promotion of marriage and dating platforms to strictly implement real-name authentication and real-name registration, and severely crack down on Illegal matchmaking activities such as marriage entrustment and marriage fraud, but relying solely on the self-discipline of dating websites lacks the strength and breadth of normalized governance, making it difficult for users to safeguard their rights, and such routines will continue to spread. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 17 Sep 2023 09:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一边补贴购车，一边对中国电动车反补贴调查，欧盟为何双标？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256872]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-17 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/16/vRua021qrFj0ZpFrqYpZ4Wv0gH0XflmZuPMb1fs2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1062&quot; height=&quot;708&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/vRua021qrFj0ZpFrqYpZ4Wv0g H0XflmZuPMb1fs2. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250981&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;September 2023, Munich Auto Show.

However, on September 13, 2023, European Commission President von der Leyen announced that it would launch a countervailing investigation into electric vehicles from China. The core of the investigation is whether the Chinese government provides subsidies to assess whether the EU needs to impose punitive tariffs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Kaijun, founder of &quot;Electric Vehicle Observer&quot; believes that all countries are introducing policies to support the development of their own electric vehicle industry, and China just implemented subsidies earlier, and there is no legitimacy issue. Moreover, China’s “state subsidy” policy for new energy vehicles has been terminated in 2022, but some EU member states are still subsidizing their own new energy vehicles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 14, a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce of China responded that China’s electric vehicle industry has developed rapidly and its competitiveness has continued to improve. This is the result of unremitting technological innovation and the construction of a complete industrial chain and supply chain. China urges the EU to proceed from the overall situation of maintaining the stability of global industrial and supply chains as well as the China-EU comprehensive strategic partnership and engage in dialogue and consultation with China. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;China’s “state subsidy” policy for electric vehicles has been withdrawn&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“The global market is now flooded with cheaper Chinese electric vehicles. And huge state subsidies have artificially depressed their prices.” Von der Leyen said that this is the core reason why the EU is considering launching a countervailing investigation into electric vehicles from China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The European Commission said that China’s market share of electric vehicles sold in Europe has risen to 8% and may reach 15% in 2025. This rapid growth in proportion is due to the fact that Chinese electric vehicles generally have a price advantage of about 20% compared to European models. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Chinese government does provide subsidies for electric vehicles, but it also set up an exit mechanism for subsidies very early. At the beginning of 2022, four departments including the Ministry of Finance jointly issued a document clarifying that the new energy vehicle purchase subsidy policy in 2022 will be terminated on December 31, 2022. Subsidies will no longer be provided for vehicles with subsequent license plates, and the &quot;state subsidy&quot; policy for electric vehicles that has continued for 13 years has been officially Withdrew from the stage of history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at Europe, many subsidy policies for the electric vehicle industry have been introduced in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, Germany provides different subsidies for pure electric vehicles based on the selling price, with the maximum subsidy of 4,500 euros for models under 40,000 euros. In 2023, the car purchase subsidy for ordinary French consumers will be 5,000 euros, and the electric vehicle subsidy for low-income families will increase to 7,000 euros. On February 1, 2023, the European Commission proposed increasing state subsidies to enable EU countries to compete with other countries in the production of electric vehicles and other green products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In the development of emerging industries such as electric vehicles, the industrial policies of various countries are very active, but there are differences in degree.&quot; Qiu Kaijun said, &quot;In the early years, the so-called completely free market did not interfere with industrial development at all. The economic theory is actually no longer popular in Europe and the United States, where there is also strong intervention and support for emerging industries.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The impact on Chinese car companies still needs to be observed&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to According to EU regulations, countervailing investigations can take up to 13 months, which means that we still need to wait for the &quot;boots to land&quot; in about a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But on the evening of September 13, Chinese concept stocks of new energy vehicles had already fallen collectively. Xpeng Motors fell 3.11%, Li Auto fell 0.54%, and NIO fell 4.64%. Hong Kong auto stocks fell in late trading, with BYD and Xpeng Motors falling 3.53% and 2.47% respectively, Geely Auto falling 1.52%, and Great Wall Motors, NIO, and Li Auto falling slightly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the launch of the anti-subsidy investigation, European policies were relatively friendly, with a tariff of 10% on cars imported from China, while the United States&#39; tariff was 27.5%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Kaijun said that the current cost advantage of Chinese car companies is very obvious. If countervailing tariffs are imposed after the investigation, the increase will be small, and Chinese car companies will still be competitive; but if punitive tariffs are imposed, such as 100% or 150%, the blow will be very severe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Forsighted Chinese car companies are preparing to build factories in Europe, and the anti-subsidy investigation may speed up their progress in building factories. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Dan, a researcher at the Institute of International Affairs of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen), suggested that Chinese car companies should strengthen coordination and consultation with the assistance of industry associations, form a joint stance and strategy, and improve the foreign economic and trade legal toolbox , accurately grasp EU legislative information and progress, work closely with the Ministry of Commerce, and negotiate with the European side in the China-EU high-level economic and trade dialogue. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;China has the best electric vehicle industry chain&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Many foreign car companies have factories in China, and the so-called electric vehicles from China also include them. Countervailing investigations will also affect non-Chinese brand models manufactured in China, such as Tesla and BMW. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Foreign brands are willing to set up factories in China, and they are voting with their feet. It is not because China has subsidies, but because China has the best electric vehicle industry chain and good automobile industry workers, just like the Ma Skoda praised the workers at Tesla&#39;s Shanghai Gigafactory for being smart and hard-working,&quot; Qiu Kaijun said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 13, the China Chamber of Commerce in the European Union issued a statement that China&#39;s electric vehicles and upstream and downstream industry chain companies have continued to innovate and have accumulated overall industrial advantages in the fierce Chinese local market. This advantage is not based on The so-called huge subsidies are formed. CITIC Securities’ research report also pointed out that China’s current electric vehicles do not rely on low prices as a selling point. Their competitiveness comes from technology accumulation, quality control, and user experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The industrial advantage is reflected in the price advantage. Qiu Kaijun gave an example to Southern Weekend reporters. Volkswagen&#39;s ID.3 model is produced in both China and Germany. It sells for 40,000 euros in Germany, while it sells for about 15,000 euros in China. The huge price difference has caused caused a wave of public opinion in Germany. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a statistics from the research organization JATO Dynamics, since 2015, the average price of electric vehicles in Europe has risen from 49,000 euros to 56,000 euros, and in the United States from 53,000 euros to 64,000 euros, while China dropped from 67,000 euros to 32,000 euros. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/sgbOXPSp4wVLuSzSIK5Atygt7XfxqiISz85gHrFJ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1086&quot; height= &quot;723&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/sgbOXPSp4wVLuSzSIK5Atygt7XfxqiISz85gHrFJ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250982&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 23, 2023 local time, in Debrecen, Hungary, an electric vehicle battery factory invested by China Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Ltd.

China’s photovoltaic industry suffered a huge blow during the “double-reverse” investigation. However, it was also at this stage that China’s photovoltaic industry fully tapped its endogenous power and localized raw materials, technology, and markets. When the “double-reverse” investigation After the investigation was withdrawn, it regained a large market share. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development path of the electric vehicle industry is different from that of the photovoltaic industry. China&#39;s electric vehicles originated in the local market and then went abroad after developing to a certain extent. The current market penetration rate of China&#39;s new energy vehicles is about 35%, and there is still a huge domestic market demand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This EU countervailing investigation also sounded the alarm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Dan believes that the EU’s launch of a countervailing investigation on electric vehicles from China is a typical trade protectionism and a manifestation of the EU’s double standards. It is completely untenable both legally and morally. Currently, there are huge differences within the EU regarding this anti-subsidy investigation. The political forces within Germany and France both support and oppose it. However, in the current political environment, the supporting forces within Germany and France have the ability to push the EU to launch an investigation and even influence it. Investigation conclusion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in addition to facing the obstacles of trade protectionism, Wu Dan believes that factors such as the inconsistency between China&#39;s national automobile standards and international standards, the fact that my country&#39;s new energy vehicle export certification system has not yet been integrated with international standards, and the decline in overseas consumption capacity are all constraints. It has promoted the international development of my country’s new energy vehicles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Dan once wrote that at the current stage, the scale of overseas investment and factory establishment by Chinese car companies is far less than that of traditional multinational car manufacturers in developed countries. Chinese car companies want to transform from a traditional trade model to an overseas business development model. Improving the autonomy and brand influence of the supporting supply chain still has to go through a long and difficult process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 17 Sep 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[恒大财富杜某等涉嫌犯罪人员被采取刑事强制措施]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256870]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 23:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/sz_mmbiz_jpg/Dm1HIR5mtBCpZsNIdQqubPCVicQZnZDBHsmns7gVm9iav5GtKbUibVljN4L3I5fNFCpHzw LxUYWrW5bEH9Kia5nIBw/640?wx_fmt= jpeg&amp;amp;wxfrom=5&amp;amp;wx_lazy=1&amp;amp;wx_co=1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 0.5;&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;https://mmbiz.qpic. cn/sz_mmbiz_jpg/Dm1HIR5mtBCpZsNIdQqubPCVicQZnZDBHsmns7gVm9iav5GtKbUibVljN4L3I5fNFCpHzwLxUYWrW5bEH9Kia5nIBw/640?wx_fmt=jpeg&amp;amp;wxfrom=5&amp;amp;wx_lazy=1 &amp;amp;wx_co=1&quot; data-key=&quot;media-1694873788117-0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 23:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[走近霍尔果斯“守关人”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256824]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/13/FqInwUqfJtlhA5sf3cCHzxzSO15M5p9oKUr1J14C.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;539&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/FqInwUqfJtlhA5sf3cCHzxzSO15 M5p9oKUr1J14C. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250554&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Police monitor China-Europe trains leaving the country at night&lt;span style=&quot;color: # aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Jia/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At 10 o&#39;clock in the evening, the sun has just set, the rails and stones are still hot, and the high temperature emitted by the train engine is uncomfortable.

According to the agreement between China and Kazakhstan, the railway port implemented a 7-day × 12-hour service model at that time, but there were only seven or eight inbound and outbound freight trains every day. Yue Shuang used &quot;boring&quot; to describe the work at that time, &quot;There was not much business volume, but it was very tiring.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The change occurred in 2014, when the railway port was officially opened in February of that year. Yue Shuang still remembers that the number of trains that summer more than doubled than before, and the number continued to grow.

The police had to climb into the carriages one by one and check the bottom of the carriages to prevent criminals or prohibited items from hiding in them and illegal entry and exit. It took more than half an hour to inspect a train. Later, they formed a mature inspection process, strengthened technological means, and carried out comprehensive monitoring of inbound and outbound trains. Now it only takes about 10 minutes to inspect a train. In order to better adapt to the growing demand for customs clearance, the border inspection station has adjusted the railway port to a 365-day × 24-hour service model, so that entry and exit trains can be inspected and released at any time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/1eF7ZbQvGlj1T8fCvN2CBPnzdGYnDZDn2hnXiIRB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;607&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/1eF7ZbQvGlj1T8fCvN2CBPnzdGYnDZDn2hnXiIRB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250561&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Check the identity of the outbound truck driver&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Jia/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Spring and Autumn Return Well, the most difficult parts are summer and winter.&quot; Yue Shuang said that the highest temperature in summer at the duty site is over 50 degrees Celsius, eggs can be fried on the railway tracks, and people often faint at the duty site; in winter, the lowest temperature drops to more than 30 degrees below zero. degrees Celsius, when the police inspected the car, their hands were accidentally stuck to the iron sheet of the carriage. If they tore it apart with force, bloody skin and flesh would be left on the carriage. In December 2018, the port encountered a blizzard with more than 70 centimeters of snow.

In his opinion, the design concept of the new national gate is more advanced. Passengers only need to scan their fingerprints and faces to clear customs in just 15 seconds; trucks adopt one-stop inspection and one-time customs clearance to improve customs clearance efficiency. From January 1 to July 21, 2023, the number of entry and exit vehicles at the port exceeded 100,000, exceeding the annual customs clearance volume of highway ports in previous years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There are many potential changes that cannot be seen at ordinary times.” Zeng Qi said.

As he was getting off work, there was still a long queue of vehicles waiting to clear customs. They urgently met and negotiated with the Kazakh border inspection department and obtained the other party&#39;s consent to extend the customs clearance time. When the news came, the drivers waiting for customs clearance in front of the boundary bridge applauded in unison. They worked until about 5 a.m. the next day, and finally completed the inspection and release of all vehicles to be inspected. &quot;Seeing so many Chinese products leaving us, no matter how tiring it is, it&#39;s worth it.&quot; On August 15, 2023, the Horgos Highway Port began to implement 24-hour freight customs clearance on a trial basis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023 is the tenth anniversary of the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative.

I chose three to give to you.&quot; He knew that I loved books, so he joked: &quot;A sword is given to a hero.&quot; It happened that a Chinese friend returned to China to visit relatives, and Liu My husband asked her to take it with her and deliver it to me when she got home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Within a few days, I received three books from Nantong: one was the 1935 edition of Kang Youwei&#39;s &quot;Book of Datong&quot; by Zhonghua Book Company. The front and back covers had fallen off, and the title page had the words &quot;Wu &quot;Huansheng&quot; is printed in white. One is the 1943 edition of Chiang Kai-shek&#39;s &quot;The Destiny of China&quot; by Zhengzhong Bookstore. There is a calligraphy inscription on the title page: &quot;Brother Zhao Jinyong Huicun, brother Liang Kui respectfully presents it.&quot; Zhao Jinyong and Liang Kui were both diplomats during the Republic of China. There is also a 1959 edition of Hu Shi&#39;s &quot;Autobiography at Forty&quot; published by Far East Book Company, which is actually signed by Hu Shi. The last invoice was made by Wu Yuanli, Mr. Liu Rongqian&#39;s uncle, and the invoice was signed on May 31, 1960. Inside the book is a copy of Mao Zishui&#39;s &quot;Three Years After the Death of Mr. Hu Shizhi&quot; published in the third issue of Volume 6 of &quot;Biographical Literature&quot;. This was beyond my expectation. I have been thinking about Hu Shi’s autographed book for a long time, but I didn’t expect that it was Mr. Liu Rongqian who helped me realize my dream. These three books were all collected by Wu Yuanli. Mr. Liu Rongqian told me that after his uncle (Editor&#39;s note: Wu Yuanli) passed away in the United States, he went to California to help his cousin deal with his uncle&#39;s belongings and asked for it from his cousin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Check the &quot;First Draft of the Long Chronicle of Mr. Hu Shizhi&quot; (Supplementary Edition) compiled by Hu Songping. It says on June 1, 1960: &quot;Wu Yuanli and Liu Tingwei came to see him. Yuanli was Wu Dingchang (Da). (Quan)’s son, let’s talk about Wu Tat-quan’s autobiography &quot;Huaxi Xianbi&quot;.&quot; It can be seen that Hu Shi prepared the book a day in advance, and the gift of &quot;Autobiography at Forty&quot; was also a thoughtful and meaningful move. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Shi and Wu Yuanli did not have a close relationship and may have only met once or twice. On June 19, 1949, they met in the United States. Hu Shi did not have too many records in his diary. He only wrote: &quot;5:30 &amp;nbsp;Mr. Wu (Son of Da Quan).&quot; At this time, the Nationalist Government had withdrawn from Nanjing and Hu Shi arrived in the United States. On June 21, Hu Shi telegraphed his resignation as Foreign Minister to the new Executive Yuan Yan Xishan, who was retreating to Guangzhou. But Hu Shi should have heard about Wu Yuanli&#39;s deeds. On the morning of July 1, 1959, he attended the fourth academician meeting of Academia Sinica and served as the chairman of the meeting. At the meeting, Jiang Shuojie reported on the research status of Chinese economists in the United States and mentioned many talents in economics, including Wu Yuanli. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/KQukqc6kLu6aOF9pBLBRSMm3uroyeMm8Jxnk6R1u.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;628&quot; height= &quot;1028&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/KQukqc6kLu6aOF9pBLBRSMm3uroyeMm8Jxnk6R1u.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250679&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wu Dingchang (back row, right), Chen Shiyun (middle seat) and his wife take a photo with their daughter Wu Yuanjun (back row, left), son-in-law Liu Tingwei (back row, center), and son Wu Yuanli (front row, right) . &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Yuanli was born in Shanghai in 1920. He studied at Shanghai Nanyang Middle School and St. John&#39;s University in his early years, and later went to England for further study. In 1942, he received a first-class honors degree in economics from the University of London. In 1946, he received a doctorate in economics and was a disciple of Hayek. After returning to China, he served in the Central Bank. In 1949, he moved to the United States and became a professor in the Department of Economics at the University of San Francisco. Chen Yuxian divided the Chinese experts who studied Sinology in North America into five major groups. The second group was &quot;around the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China. A group of scholars who studied or taught in church universities migrated to North America. They encountered the expansion of North American institutions of higher learning after World War II.&quot; Soon, they became fluent in both Chinese and English and settled in various universities, becoming the backbone of Chinese studies in each school.&quot; Wu Yuanli is the leader in this second group. Since 1960, Wu Yuanli has served as a researcher and consultant at the Hoover Institution of Stanford University. He used the rich collections of the Hoover Library to write books such as &quot;Overseas Chinese and the Economic Development of Southeast Asia&quot;, &quot;The Role of the Chinese in the Economic Development of Southeast Asia&quot; and &quot;Taiwan: Towards an Industrialized Society&quot;. Precisely because of Wu Yuanli&#39;s superb research on China issues, he served as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense of the United States from 1969 to 1970. In 1985, Wu Yuanli won the Humboldt Foundation Research Award in Germany. In November 2008, Wu Yuanli accidentally fell and caused intracranial hemorrhage. He died at Stanford University Hospital in California on the 18th at the age of 88. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/3BQKBU2VVI5x5r8qEWYPN7BSq3FboPaO0bFfSg1A.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1104&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/3BQKBU2VVI5x5r8qEWYPN7BSq3FboPaO0bFfSg1A.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250683&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A group photo of Wu and Liu families.

Provided by Liu Rongqian. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I asked Mr. Liu Rongqian what special impression he had on this uncle (Editor&#39;s note: Wu Yuanli)? He said that when he was a child, he lived with his grandparents in Guiyang (Editor&#39;s note: referring to Wu Dingchang and his wife, Wu was the chairman of Guizhou Province at the time). One day the postman delivered a silver-gray box with a piece of coffee cake and a lot of dried fruits. His grandmother told him this It was sent from London by my uncle, and I still haven&#39;t forgotten the sweet taste. After the war of resistance against Japan was over in Nanjing, his uncle brought back his aunt with blue eyes and blond hair. This was the first time he saw his uncle and the first time he talked directly to &quot;foreigners&quot;. He felt strange. Later, his uncle went to the United States, and his family went to live in Taiwan. In 1962, my grandmother passed away, and my uncle returned to Taiwan to attend the funeral. In 1965, when he was studying in Paris, his uncle and aunt came to see him. They saw that he was studying design during the day and working in a hotel at night. His life was difficult. His uncle suggested that he go to the United States to study economics instead. It would be easier to find a job after graduation and it would also help He lends a helping hand. He answered his uncle: &quot;I can only draw.&quot; In 1965, Liu Rongqian immigrated to Canada. A few years later, he brought his parents to live in Canada. His uncle would come to visit relatives every year. After Mr. Liu&#39;s parents passed away, he often visited his uncle in California, chatted with him, and discussed the foundation to commemorate Wu Chen Shiyun (Editor&#39;s note: Wu Dingchang&#39;s wife).舅舅去世时，他正在北京，来不及奔丧，后来便去加州帮不认识中文的表妹整理满屋的中文书籍和资料。刘先生说，舅舅一生低调，动作说话和缓，善于倾听和发问，对后辈非常关心照顾。 “可能舅舅年轻时候在英国读书，受到英国人的冷幽默影响，在谈话中往往会冷不防让人发笑。记得那年在巴黎，我们坐在露天咖啡馆，他说巴黎很有趣，一半巴黎人坐在咖啡馆看另一半巴黎人。如果以一句话来形容我对舅舅的印象：他是一位带有幽默感的君子。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;胡适与吴元黎的父亲吴鼎昌却是老相识了，并对他有很高的评价。一九三一年二月二十六日，曹纕蘅邀柯劭忞、郑孝胥、江瀚、杨钟羲等人一起吃饭，也请了吴鼎昌、胡适，这是他们第一次见面。当天胡适日记有记：“吴君是一个能干的人，我久想见他，屡次相左。今日始初次见他。”吴鼎昌比胡适年长七八岁，是实业家、银行家，担任过中国银行总裁、盐业银行总经理以及北京政府财政部次长等职。后来，他收购了《大公报》，自任社长，请胡政之任总经理、张季鸾任总编辑，使《大公报》获得新生，成为全国颇有影响的报纸之一。因此，给胡适留下了“能干”的印象。当年十一月，南京国民政府设立财政委员会，胡适、吴鼎昌同为委员。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/gvp2av25spnjzLea2PNQn5ygS6DkCvKHe2kwJAk4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;479&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/gvp2av25spnjzLea2PNQn5ygS6DkCvKHe2kwJAk4.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;一九三四年一月三十一日，胡适与吴鼎昌在南京汪精卫的官舍相遇，在座还有张季鸾、任鸿隽、陈衡哲、唐有壬、曾仲鸣等，他们大谈外交内政问题。意犹未尽。散后，回到寓所，胡适与吴鼎昌谈到深夜。当时，中日关系日趋紧张，对于外交内政政策，有很多不同的声音。胡适与吴鼎昌的意见显然不同，但这并不影响胡适对吴鼎昌的好印象。当年七月，胡适撰写《从私立学校到燕京大学》，谈到私人捐款兴学，又举了吴鼎昌的例子：“钱多的可以改造一个大学。……钱少的也可以专补助某一校某一部分，如吴鼎昌先生的捐助南开大学经济学系助学金额。这样方才可以积少成多，使已有成绩的学校变为更有成绩。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;胡适与吴元黎、刘廷蔚谈到的《花溪闲笔》，是吴鼎昌在贵州省政府主席任上写的，一九四〇年十月由贵州日报社印行，有《赴任时》《到任后》《省》《县》《中央行政与地方》《杂感》《附言》七章。过了三年，胡政之劝吴鼎昌续写《花溪闲笔》，故有《续编》九章，即《省政》《县镇》《新县制》《县与乡镇》《新生活》《治安与帮会》《经济与统制》《财政与会计》《杂感》，于一九四三年十月由贵州企业股份有限公司印刷所刊行。吴鼎昌办过报纸，据说诗文都很不错。曹聚仁说过：“余读其《花溪闲笔》正续编，喜其平实近情。他的女公子，集其所作诗篇，分送至好；我看了，觉得名下无虚士，有可传之作。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;离开贵州后，吴鼎昌担任过国民政府文官长兼国民党中央设计局秘书长、总统府秘书长等职，曾向蒋介石建议邀请毛泽东到重庆谈判。一九四九年一月，已退休的吴鼎昌在儿子的催促下，来到香港生活。一九五〇年八月二十二日，吴鼎昌以癌症不治在港病逝。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/WrMFUIDTySoVmp3a1GM2tmUVYsCQiSp4eHl8e3wK.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;胡适与刘廷蔚没有什么直接的交集，但对他的大哥刘廷芳却是很熟悉的。刘廷芳少年之时就深得苏慧廉、蔡博敏、司徒雷登等人的赏识，司徒雷登更是推荐他到上海圣约翰大学深造，后又安排他赴美留学。刘廷芳在美先后获哥伦比亚大学学士、硕士学位，耶鲁大学神学院神学士学位，哥伦比亚大学教育心理学博士学位。回国后，与司徒雷登一道在燕京大学工作，是司徒雷登开创燕大事业的重要助手。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/kzPxt48fnGol2uq1muiA1nHoLJfOKkF0tqevZMwr.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;晚年吴元黎。上世纪四十年代，吴元黎主张赋予穷人权利，由他们自由发展。另一位著名经济学家方显廷则主张依靠精英的规划发展经济，由精英替穷人作主，两人的争论以方显廷得势而告终。吴元黎退走美国，名字渐渐被人遗忘。直到2007年，美国的经济思想史学者保罗·特雷斯科特才重新发现了吴元黎，认为吴方论战是发展经济学史上最早的论战。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（资料图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;胡适日记里最早关于刘廷芳的记载在一九二一年四月二十八日：“到刘廷芳家吃饭。刘君治宗教学，家藏宗教史的书甚多。”同年五月十八日：“上午，司徒尔先生与刘廷芳牧师与霍进德先生来谈。”同年六月三十日，北京大学、男女两高师、尚志学会、新学会等在中央公园今雨轩为杜威一家饯行，胡适与刘廷芳、吴卓生夫妇都在。胡适代表北大致词，自己译成汉语又讲了一次。吴卓生代表女高师致词，则由刘廷芳翻译成汉语。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一九二一年时，燕京大学想改良国文部，司徒雷登、刘廷芳邀请胡适去主持工作，但胡适没有同意，而是推荐周作人去。他认为周作人在北大用非所长，很可惜，所以让他“出去独当一面”。不巧周氏病了，此事就搁置了一年。次年，燕京方面又提起此事，故一九二二年三月四日，胡适邀司徒雷登、刘廷芳、周作人来，为他们做介绍，让他们自己当面谈。胡适日记记道：“他们谈的很满意。”周作人在燕大教了十来年书，直到被北大聘为研究教授，不能兼外校课程。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一九三七年一月十一日，胡适“到燕大刘廷芳吃饭”。此后胡适日记再无刘廷芳出现。刘廷芳后来当选为立法委员，但因身体状况一直欠佳，一九四二年赴美就医，一九四七年逝世于新墨西哥州一家长老会医院，享年五十六岁。不知胡适与刘廷蔚见面时，有否想起他的哥哥刘廷芳。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘荣黔先生现生活于加拿大魁北克省蒙特利尔市，一直邀请我去游玩。 “别忘了我这年纪已经在倒数计时了，请尽早成行。”而我却想，他应趁现在还能走动，早点回家看看。刘荣黔久居海外，从未到过老家温州。二〇一五年五月，他在杭州举办“无意之境”摄影艺术展，我去观摩学习，匆匆一面。幸好还有微信，分别后我们可以随时网上交流。那是刘荣黔先生离老家最近的一次。几个月前，南京大学沈卫威教授来温州大学讲座之便，让我陪他去寻访刘廷芳旧踪。那一带正进行历史街区改造，刘廷芳回国后为他母亲建的小洋房已不得入。沈教授透过一幢办公楼里的卫生间窗户才看到刘氏故居一角。所以，请刘荣黔先生“尽早成行”吧。 &lt;/p>;
