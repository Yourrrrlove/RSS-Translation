(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;County subsidence is one of the core issues in the field of basic education in recent times. For example, Professor Lin Xiaoying of Peking University&#39;s &quot;Children in the County—— The book &quot;China&#39;s County Education Ecology&quot; paints this picture: College entrance examination scores have seriously declined, high-quality students have disappeared, and the teaching team is aging... Counties that were once an important link in the upward mobility channel for children from poor families have been unable to perform as expected. As a result, the desolation of education in the county has become a spreading reality, and the county is like a hometown that has bid farewell, becoming a relic of the new urban middle class who have completed individual urbanization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I am ashamed to say that during the years when I devoted myself to serving basic education schools, I visited some counties, but I was not aware of the sharp social issue of &quot;county collapse&quot;. problem, but not much in-depth understanding. For example, a certain county in Shandong Province that I once served relied on its rising admission rate and even continued to export students from Qingbei, challenging the &quot;big boss&quot; in the region and province year after year. Not only is it not a &quot;collapse&quot;, but on the contrary, it has soared in the local basic education rankings - often real estate self-media or parents&#39; actual word-of-mouth. It is eventually called a &quot;counterattack&quot; by the education industry media and is considered to have achieved A perfect transformation from a county high school located in the suburbs to a &quot;modern school well-known in Qilu and going nationwide.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;You can even read comments like this on social media, talking about an interesting phenomenon in Shandong: enterprising children from urban families often try their best to The solution is to go back and study in the county. Campus life is very rich. &quot;It is not a college entrance examination factory. There are many sports teams, cultural festivals, and art societies, and it has also cultivated many competition experts.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Of course, as mentioned in the comments, those who try their best to return to the county may not necessarily be &quot;enterprising children&quot;, but more likely to be &quot;enterprising children&quot;. Enterprising parents.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The factors of the general environment are well known: social urbanization drives educational urbanization, and due to the innate Confucian emphasis on education genes in the East Asian cultural circle, once educational urbanization begins, Its speed must be much ahead of social urbanization. So we see this phenomenon: children from rural areas enter the county, and children from the county town enter the city. The county town between the countryside and the city, among the counties that have created a large number of miracles after the reform and opening up, has lost its aura in the new historical changes. Furthermore, the pivotal value of urban-rural conversion and class crossing has gradually been lost. The process of this underlying logic manifesting itself in reality is reflected in the collapse of the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot;Children in the County&quot;, written by Lin Xiaoying, Shanghai People&#39;s Publishing House, July 2023.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/11/13/732705cbef.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1583&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/ 13/732705cbef.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258115&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Children in the County&quot;, written by Lin Xiaoying, Shanghai People&#39;s Publishing House , July 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, in this process of urbanization transformation, there will also be a phenomenon of &quot;counter-urbanization&quot; that rises against the trend: some former counties Expanded into a super school. The former county school mentioned earlier has also emerged as an educational group that can challenge the provincial government and has several branch schools, covering both public and private systems. In fact, the counties that I have visited and served often have the following two characteristics: balanced distance and extreme county mode. The so-called equilibrium distance means that these rising counties are often not far or close to the central city of the central city, or they themselves were once suburban counties of the central city and later became the suburbs of the city. The Ultimate County High School model refers to taking the model from the glory days of the early County High School to the extreme: after competing for high-quality students, using extreme exam-oriented methods, suppressing one&#39;s nature and gaining the psychological motivation to live toward death in order to succeed in the college entrance examination. But this psychological dynamic is often accompanied by strong feelings of resentment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This is why some students from super middle schools think of themselves as typical examples of children from poor families. Even though urbanization transformation has been achieved, the ideology of these schools still remains at the county level. Through the confrontation between urban and rural areas, the bottom class and the elite, they have obtained the rationality and motivational support resources to inherit and complete the county education model. . I still remember the famous saying of a student from Hengshui Middle School: &quot;I am just a native pig from the countryside, but I am determined to conquer the cabbage in the big city.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; &quot;>;But this classmate, who regarded himself as a local pig, was picked up by his father in an Audi private car during the vacation. In those &quot;rising counties&quot;, there is also a question mark as to how many children are from the counties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The rising counties started with extremely exam-oriented education. After completing primitive accumulation, they began to enter a more diversified development. Even in the face of the new college entrance examination reform, the resources and capital they have are enough to cope with this change. They can even use this as an opportunity to achieve secondary development and complete the complete transformation from rural civilization to urban civilization - the transformation is completed. The sign may be that in the future, on social platforms such as Zhihu, graduates from these schools will no longer lament that after reaching university, there is still a gap between them and students who graduated from the real cities such as Xingshi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, behind the rise of super-secondary counties is often the decline of one century-old county after another. This is the real dilemma of county education. Wang Xinfeng, from the China Education Policy Research Institute at Beijing Normal University, pointed out in the keynote report &quot;County Dilemmas from the Perspective of Access to Higher Education Opportunities&quot; that at present, high-quality students, teachers and other educational resources are gradually gathering in central cities, and the gap in high school education resources continues to widen. , in some areas, the decline in the quality of higher education in counties has become an inevitable trend. This will not only have an impact on the county&#39;s education ecology and social governance pattern, but also explicitly and implicitly exclude access to higher education opportunities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Many of the expectations given to the county today are related to our social development stage: after entering the 1980s, the start of China&#39;s urbanization process provided the county with brilliant opportunities possible, but this brilliance diminished with the arrival of the next stage of development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;We might as well extend the timeline longer. Andrew Byron Kipnis, professor of the Department of Anthropology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, in his book &quot;Desire for Governance Education&quot; describes Zouping, Shandong: Like other places in China, Zouping experienced shocking political ruptures in the 20th century. The end of the Qing Dynasty, the beginning of the Republic of China, the Japanese invasion, and the civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Amidst all the ruptures, education showed the continued development of On the one hand, basic education has developed steadily - eliminating illiteracy, first by universalizing six years of primary education, and later by nine years of compulsory education. Although education developed most rapidly in the 1950s and 1970s, education also improved as early as the early 1930s during the rural construction movement promoted by Liang Shuming and others in Zouping. The institutional foundation for the popularization of education was laid even as early as the Republic of China. Finally, after more than half a century of continuous efforts, in January 1995, Zouping achieved two basic goals: nine-year compulsory education, and the elimination of illiteracy among the population under the age of 45. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;So, in the current discussion of the collapse of many counties, what does it mean to revitalize the county? Is it going back to the peak of the county in the 1980s and 1990s, or even earlier, to become a high point where the cultural context of the place condenses? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, the real problem in the revitalization of the county is not the county itself, but more importantly, the importance of the county&#39;s social ecology and educational ecology in the process of historical change. Shape and coordinate. At the same time, as an important part of social governance, how to achieve good governance in education under a deterministic new value scale is probably the real issue in the revitalization of the county. Specifically, this kind of &quot;good governance&quot;, as summarized by Wang Xinfeng, firstly requires adhering to the system concept, clarifying the characteristics of the social development stage, and re-examining county development issues under the strategic goals of common prosperity and new urbanization; secondly, it must improve education Allocate resources, strengthen comprehensive management of education, and ensure a fair starting point for county middle school students to obtain higher education opportunities on the basis of high-quality development; third, continue to deepen the reform of the examination and enrollment system, expand the implementation scope of special plans, and ensure that county middle school students have higher education in the college admissions process. Equity in educational opportunities and outcomes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The author used to be a college teacher and is now a basic education service practitioner&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[被砍掉又被续命，只因它是《万神殿》]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260482]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-13 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;Last year, AMC’s animated science fiction drama &quot;Yiban.io&quot; &quot;Temple&quot; detonated the entire Internet, and it still has a super high score of 8.8 on Douban, and even 100% unanimous praise on the Rotten Tomatoes website. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just when the majority of drama fans were eagerly awaiting the second season, the show was not well-received and had poor ratings. AMC, which was already financially weak, decided to cancel the sequel. Fortunately, Amazon took over and injected funds to continue the production of the second season, allowing &quot;Pantheon&quot; to be fully concluded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that the second season is online, it is immediately popular, with an opening score of 9.3, making it the strongest animated show this year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/d51400ace003e248fe55a2a3fc03381a.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;469&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/d51400ace003e248fe55a2a3fc03381a.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258030&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Before analyzing the second season, let us first review the science fiction setting and story background of the first season. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The core concept of &quot;Pantheon&quot; is &quot;upload intelligence&quot;, referred to as &quot;UI&quot;. The technology company in the play uploads signal data to the network through precise scanning of neurons in the human brain to generate upload intelligence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different from AI tools such as &quot;ChatGPT&quot; that we are familiar with, to a certain extent, uploaded intelligence can be regarded as a brand new life form, but it gets rid of the physical body and travels in the online world with pure consciousness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/638c91e580c26315f242bd7f1075d532.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/638c91e580c26315f242bd7f1075d532.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258026&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Season 1 In it, David, the father of the heroine Mandy, uploaded his neuron signals to the Internet before his death, becoming the earliest uploaded intelligence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Indian engineer Chanda and genius girl Laurie have become uploading intelligence. However, their positions are completely opposite. Chanda wants to expand the world of uploaded intelligence in an extreme way; Laurie is a defender of the real world and wants to join forces with David to resist Chanda&#39;s conspiracy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/5b528a262c1e05d1d08171f2c5e1296c.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/5b528a262c1e05d1d08171f2c5e1296c.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258027&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Season 1 In the end, David sacrificed himself to preserve human society, but what followed was a global disconnection, and governments around the world were afraid of the unlimited capabilities of uploaded intelligence. Not only that, due to the &quot;integrity defect&quot;, the uploaded intelligence itself is also very unstable, and may completely die as its energy continues to decay. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key to solving the problem falls on the hero Caspian. This is a cloned boy who grew up in design just like Truman in &quot;The Truman Show&quot;. Caspian&#39;s identity is Steve, the founder of the technology giant company &quot;Algorithm Beat&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/633fef39cf5c0fa88f9507f9f04beeca.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/633fef39cf5c0fa88f9507f9f04beeca.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258028&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, no. At the beginning of the second season, two major conflicts emerged. One is that public protests continue, and they believe that the crisis caused by Upload Smart is just a cover, demanding that the government immediately restore the network; the other is that the government still intends to use Upload Smart for its own use, but must address its own shortcomings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, the “safe browsing” software launched by the government has become a prerequisite for people to access the Internet. To put it bluntly, this is an anti-virus software that specifically hunts upload intelligence; as for Caspian, with the help of Mandy, he solved the core problem of &quot;integrity defect&quot; and made the upload intelligence truly immortal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/079b5ca53d39aefa7f1a68cdff536a74.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/079b5ca53d39aefa7f1a68cdff536a74.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258029&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If, The focus of the first season of &quot;Pantheon&quot; was on uploading intelligence&#39;s confusion about self-identity and the complex situation of ethical relationships. In the second season, the depth of thinking and critical consciousness displayed in the series are much broader and deeper. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first is the issue of &quot;integrity defects&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as more than ten years ago, the extremely smart Steve had actually understood everything about uploading intelligence, and even ordered his subordinates to freeze and seal his brain, starting a cloning project, with the purpose of cultivating intelligence. Caspian, let him solve the problem that he can&#39;t do anything about. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/df2b3aafe8aa8eb9f8e8c5459044fa69.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/df2b3aafe8aa8eb9f8e8c5459044fa69.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258031&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to history Tiff has the same brain circuit, so Caspian cannot easily break through the mental prison. The most interesting thing about the episode is that it uses Mandy&#39;s words to inspire Caspian. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Mandy&#39;s view, &quot;others&quot; are the reason why we are where we are today as a human species, and the reason why we live and die. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To put it more simply, we do not live for ourselves, but become uneven and colorful because of external driving forces. The richness of human nature does not depend on one&#39;s own cultivation and growth, but on the instantaneous changes around us. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/c86caf40a7d0894d876aa8cf5ad522f1.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;604&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/c86caf40a7d0894d876aa8cf5ad522f1.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258032&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, when When Caspian analyzed David&#39;s raw data, he realized that concern for his daughter constituted a necessary factor for David to be a complete soul. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is actually similar to the setting of the first season. The reason why David, Chanda and Laurie, unlike other experimenters, have self-awareness is because they came into contact with their family and loved ones. . Emotion bridges the shortcomings of reason. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/5cf3f9aa69ed948b2eb5caaa0d6265a2.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/5cf3f9aa69ed948b2eb5caaa0d6265a2.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258034&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another character in the play A setting worth chewing is Mandy’s “sister” Misty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fog is neither AI (artificial intelligence) nor UI (upload intelligence), but CI (cloud intelligence). It sounds a bit convoluted, but it&#39;s actually not difficult to understand. AI is an intelligent agent created by humans; UI is the life form of human consciousness; and CI is a new existence that UI reproduces in the online world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why Misty claims to be Mandy&#39;s sister is because she was automatically generated from David and Laurie&#39;s data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/b21304b07717bd09eb69cddc6a6551a2.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;603&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/b21304b07717bd09eb69cddc6a6551a2.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258035&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mandy knows After this situation, it is difficult to accept. After all, does mist count as a living thing? It is difficult to define. Even if it is regarded as a living body, if a stranger suddenly comes to Mandy and recognizes her, how should the latter treat it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of imaginative ethical setting has almost never appeared in previous film and television works. It not only explores the essence of life, but also asks: Does family ties originate from blood relatives, or does it rely on memory and emotion? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Pantheon&quot; does not deal with this topic perfunctorily, but tells us the mixed feelings in family relationships through the fierce conflict between Mandy and Misty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/f4ad6918b09f6a1493ac0c728419a1c6.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;610&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/f4ad6918b09f6a1493ac0c728419a1c6.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258036&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Mandy When she placed all her hopes on Misty, hoping that she could defeat Steve, the latter used a set of logical and rigorous arguments to convince Misty. Mandy was very angry about this, and even yelled out that Misty was not her sister at all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fact that Miwu left angrily and even ignored Mandy in anger for a long time proved her &quot;humanity&quot; from the side. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The difference is that human beings will feel sad because of the past, but because Misty has no past, she will only feel lonely and lonely about the future. This kind of psychological detail with great speculative significance may be the reason why the drama &quot;Pantheon&quot; often makes our souls tremble and make us realize something. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/57ba95a043a940eb29344ced252608ea.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;602&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/57ba95a043a940eb29344ced252608ea.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258033&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If, The content and themes of the first six episodes are still at the level of binary opposition, that is, the game between the &quot;human faction&quot; represented by Mandy and Caspian, and the &quot;upload intelligence faction&quot; represented by Steve, then The last two episodes completely exceeded the psychological expectations of fans of the drama, crossing over to bold assumptions about the future world in sociology, politics, psychology and other levels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Steve was defeated, the technology of uploading intelligence has not stopped. Just twenty years after Caspian and Steve &quot;died together&quot;, a total of four billion people around the world were uploaded from real society to cyberspace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the reasons why people choose this path are not forced by impending death, but the inevitable result of the rapid increase in productivity and the subsequent changes in production relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/31c9e6070343239a4e00136afdd8dee9.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;603&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/31c9e6070343239a4e00136afdd8dee9.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258037&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Upload smart user The least time cost, the most work tasks can be completed, so in the real society, &quot;the living people are gradually being robbed of their jobs by the dead.&quot; When death becomes immortality, and freedom and wealth become available without any effort, human beings will no longer pity the physical body but yearn for the virtual. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, this relationship is fluid. When we follow Caspian&#39;s perspective and quickly understand the changes in the past two decades, we will find that no matter what time it is, hostility, war, and ideological division will always exist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second season of &quot;Pantheon&quot;, like a science fiction accelerator with continuous brainstorming, takes us to imagine the &quot;earth past&quot; that is very likely to happen in the future, and allows love and family relationships to develop over decades and on. In the long span of hundreds to hundreds of thousands of years, incredible flavors are fermented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/12f8e61ae80a884e517ccee74c55ab85.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;604&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/12f8e61ae80a884e517ccee74c55ab85.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258038&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In reality , a piece of profound data shows that as of January 2021, more than 500 people around the world have been cryogenically sealed, and more than 3,000 wealthy people have registered for cryogenic projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Will this group of people, like the uploaded intelligence in &quot;Pantheon&quot;, become the first batch of &quot;network immigrants&quot; in the metaverse in the future?

The top five provinces with obesity in the country are: Hebei (21.9%), Inner Mongolia (19.8%), Shandong (19.7%), Tianjin (19.6%), Liaoning ( 18.2%). Compared with northern provinces and cities, the obesity rate in southern provinces is lower. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Where does the obesity difference between North and South come from? The &quot;Dietary Guidelines for Chinese Residents (2022)&quot; defines the eating habits of Fujian, Guangdong and other regions as &quot;Oriental healthy dietary patterns&quot;. This model has the characteristics of high food diversity, relatively light diet, sufficient intake of fresh vegetables and fruits, relatively high intake of fish and shrimp, low intake of pork, etc., and enhanced intake of milk and legumes. , resulting in a higher overall meal quality compliance rate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Compared with the lighter eating habits in the south, northern cuisine is more flavorful and pays attention to both color, flavor and flavor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Of course, the increase in obesity rate is not only caused by &quot;eating&quot;. From the perspective of scientific research: obesity is determined by system dynamics factors and environmental determinants. This push is amplified or moderated by individual-level genetic susceptibility, psychosocial factors, obesogens and adverse early life exposures and other coexisting underlying risk factors, through unhealthy diet and lack of physical activity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;While paying attention to obesity, the topic #weightloss# often also attracts much attention. For example, on Douyin, Xiaohongshu, Weibo and other platforms, there are Videos and notes on the topic #weightloss# have been read more than 10 million times. Not only that, but various weight loss tools are also emerging in endlessly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Obesity is also a &quot;fulcrum&quot; that drives various diseases. The World Health Organization report believes that overweight and obesity are important causes of high blood pressure. Among endocrine and metabolic diseases, the diabetes rate among overweight people is as high as 20.4%, which is 4 to 5 times higher than that among people with normal weight. Modern research has also proven that obese people are often accompanied by hyperinsulinemia, which may be the root cause of cancer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Healthy and scientific weight loss and exercise are very important. For your own health, &quot;Know&quot; tells you how to say &quot;goodbye&quot; to excess fat correctly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/a588b511f1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/a588b511f1.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251542&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/4926193e5c.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440 &quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/4926193e5c.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251543&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot; &quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/c2a2877735.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot; //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/c2a2877735.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251544&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http: //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/1963d6ccc4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/1963d6ccc4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251545&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/4b9bb6c400.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/09/21/4b9bb6c400.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251546&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/09/21/c2675d0556.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/ 21/c2675d0556.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251547&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/ 21/300577827d.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/300577827d.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251548&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 13 Nov 2023 22:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[借转融通“绕道减持”的不只高瓴，沪深交易所紧急打补丁]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260532]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-13 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 8 and November 10, 2023, the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges issued multiple Guidelines for self-regulation.

In accordance with the Penalty Law and other laws and regulations, the China Securities Regulatory Commission decided to file a case against HHLR Management Co., Ltd., a shareholder of Longi Green Energy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;HHLR Management Co., Ltd.-China Value Fund (hereinafter referred to as HHLR) is an investment management company under Hillhouse Capital focusing on the secondary market. It was formerly known as Hillhouse Capital Management Co., Ltd.-China Value Fund Trading (hereinafter referred to as Hillhouse Asset Management). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March, HHLR, the major shareholder holding 5.85% of Longi Green Energy, lent 1% of its shares through two refinancings. However, after the maturity and return, HHLR’s shareholding dropped by 0.87% compared with before the loan. gap. The market suspects that HHLR reduced its holdings during the refinancing period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, not only HHLR, but also many shareholders of listed companies have quietly reduced their shareholdings to less than 5% after refinancing. It’s just that Hillhouse Capital, as a star investment institution, has attracted a lot of attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regulatory response was rapid. On November 8 and 10, the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges issued a number of self-regulatory guidelines aimed at patching the above vulnerabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Disappeared Shares&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;HHLR&#39;s shares were originally transferred from LONGi Green Energy&#39;s major shareholders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On December 19, 2020, Li Chunan, the major shareholder of Longi Green Energy, transferred 6% of his shares to Hillhouse Asset Management at a price of 70 yuan per share. The total transaction consideration was approximately 15.84 billion yuan. . Li Chunan is the concerted person acting in concert with the actual controllers of LONGi Co., Ltd. Li Zhenguo and Li Xiyan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the alumni news of Lanzhou University, LONGi Green Energy was co-founded by three classmates from the physics department of Lanzhou University in 1986 - Li Zhenguo, Zhong Baoshen, and Li Chunan. It was named after the old president Jiang Longji. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the first trading day after the transfer announcement, LONGi Green Energy opened sharply and closed at the daily limit. Subsequently, LONGi redeemed its convertible bonds, the total share capital increased, and Hillhouse Asset Management&#39;s shareholding was diluted to 5.85%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On March 21, 2023, Longi Green Energy issued the &quot;Informative Announcement Regarding Shareholders&#39; Participation in the Refinancing Securities Lending Business and Equity Changes&quot;, stating that the renamed Hillhouse Asset Management, or HHLR, participated in the refinancing. Rongtong Securities Lending Business lends 0.85% of its shares with a term of 182 days. It plans to continue lending no more than 0.15% of its shares in the next 90 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Margin financing is when investors ask brokers to borrow money to buy stocks or borrow stocks to sell. However, brokers’ own funds and securities sources are limited, so refinancing has emerged, including refinancing and refinancing. Vouchers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The refinancing business in mainland China began in 2013. China Securities Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as CSI Financial), as the counterparty to securities lending transactions, is the only domestic financial institution engaged in refinancing business. Its shareholders include the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, refinancing business means that CSI Financial lends its own funds or funds raised through the issuance of bonds to securities companies, and then the securities companies lend it to customers for them to buy and list. Company stock. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Securities refinancing business means that CSI Financial borrows securities from &quot;lenders&quot; such as shareholders of listed companies, and then refinances them to securities companies, which provide them to customers for sale. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, in the securities refinancing business that Hillhouse Asset Management participates in, CSI Financial first borrows circulating securities from the shareholders of Longi Green Energy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Longi Green Energy did not disclose the specific time for lending 0.15% of HHLR shares. However, its first quarter report for 2023 shows that HHLR’s shareholding has dropped to 4.85%, which means that HHLR participated in two refinancings within 10 days at the end of March. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was also not disclosed when the shares loaned by HHLR will expire. Based on the time of its participation in refinancing and the 182-day lending period, it can be inferred that the 1% of shares lent by HHLR should be returned no later than September 30. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, LONGi Green Energy’s third quarter report for 2023 shows that HHLR’s shareholding is only 4.98%, which is 0.87% lower than the 5.89% shareholding before participating in refinancing. HHLR also did not disclose the reasons why its holdings decreased during the period when the shares were loaned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Measures for the Administration of Disclosure of Listed Companies&quot; and other relevant regulations, when shareholders holding more than 5% of the shares change, they should proactively inform the board of directors of the listed company and cooperate with the listed company in fulfilling its information disclosure obligations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, LONGi Green Energy stated in the relevant announcement of HHLR refinancing in March that the shares were not registered under the name of the information disclosure obligor (HHLR) during the loan period, and “after the completion of this equity change, information disclosure The obligor shall no longer be a shareholder holding more than 5% of the shares of the listed company.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The market generally believes that HHLR has circumvented the letter disclosure requirements for shareholders holding more than 5% of the shares through refinancing, thus achieving a &quot;detour reduction&quot;. Based on LONGi Green Energy’s current stock price of 23 yuan per share, HHLR has a floating loss of approximately 5.6 billion yuan compared with the time of purchase. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporter sent an interview letter to Hillhouse’s official email, asking whether he had reduced his shareholding during the refinancing period, and under which regulations he was determined to no longer hold more than 5% of the shares of Longi Green Energy. Shareholders have not received a reply as of press time. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Not an isolated case&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;For a long time, the securities lending business developed slowly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report of the Shanghai Securities Fund Evaluation and Research Center shows that as of April 30, 2020, the balance of margin financing and securities lending was 1.0431 billion yuan, accounting for 2.16% of the circulating market value of A-shares, of which the financing balance was 1.0216 billion yuan. Accounting for 97.9% of the total, insufficient securities sources are one of the main obstacles limiting the development of the securities lending market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to expand the source of securities, in 2019 and 2020, the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges successively included qualified institutional investors such as public funds, social security funds, and insurance funds, as well as strategic investors participating in the issuer’s initial public offering. Include lenders and participate in securities lending on the Science and Technology Innovation Board and GEM. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2023, the China Securities Regulatory Commission issued relevant systems for the full implementation of the registration system, and extended the optimization measures for refinancing securities on the Science and Technology Innovation Board and GEM to the main board, further liberalizing the refinancing business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although there is no express provision, during the period of participation in refinancing, the relevant shares are generally not registered in the name of the lender. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the official website of CSI Financial, the refinancing securities lending business does not constitute a substantive securities transfer. If equity distribution occurs during the securities lending period, CSI Financial will compensate the lender in accordance with the business rules. However, CSI Financial Finance does not provide lenders with compensation for voting rights. During the period of securities lending, the number of shares held in the shareholder register will temporarily change and will be restored after the securities lending expires and is withdrawn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hillhouse is not an isolated case, this phenomenon frequently occurs in A-shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 5, 2022, Huayi Brothers (300027.SZ) issued an announcement stating that Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Tencent Computer), a shareholder holding 7.942441% of the shares, reduced its holdings through block transactions. 1.942447%, and participated in refinancing lending of 0.999998%.

After the equity change, Bona Film and Television holds 4.9999% of the shares and &quot;is no longer a shareholder holding more than 5% of the company&#39;s shares.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guomai Culture’s 2023 interim report showed that Bona Film and Television’s shareholding was reduced to 4.15%, and by the third quarter report, it was reduced to 3.15%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 31, 2023, Yuncong Technology (688327.SH) announced that its shareholder Jiadu Technology (600728.SH), which holds 6.63157% of the shares, reduced its holdings by 0.81579% through block transactions. During the refinancing process, the same share was lent, which reduced its shareholding to 4.99999%, &quot;no longer a shareholder holding more than 5% of the company&#39;s shares.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yuncong Technology’s third quarter report for 2023 shows that Jiadu Technology’s shareholding ratio has been reduced to 3%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shareholders of the above four companies all &quot;coincidentally&quot; reduced their shareholdings below the 5% letter disclosure red line through refinancing, and then reduced their shareholdings without letter disclosure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Just because there is a precedent does not mean it is right.” According to Wang Jiyue, a senior investment banker, supervision clearly requires shareholders to reduce their holdings of more than 5%, and Hillhouse’s approach took advantage of loopholes in the rules. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Emergency patching&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“Special treatment can be given to the disclosure rules of equity changes and shareholding reductions involved in securities lending.” Peng Bing, professor of Peking University Law School and securities law expert, told the South A reporter over the weekend explained that lending shares cannot be regarded as a true reduction of holdings because the lent shares will still be returned, so changes in equity should not be regarded as a reduction in equity and can be specifically disclosed as a temporary suspension. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As soon as the words were spoken, supervision had already patched the loopholes in the rules. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 8th and 10th, the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Shenzhen Stock Exchange, Science and Technology Innovation Board and GEM all updated self-regulatory guidelines, mainly revising the information disclosure content of relevant entities participating in refinancing business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take the Shanghai Stock Exchange as an example. It issued the &quot;Shanghai Stock Exchange Self-Regulatory Guidelines for Listed Companies No. 2 - Business Processing (Revised in November 2023)&quot;, which requires shareholders holding more than 5% of the shares to Clear requirements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the guidelines, when investors and their concerted parties participate in margin trading, securities lending and refinancing business, the number of shares of the same listed company held by their ordinary securities accounts and customer credit securities accounts shall be the same as the number of shares that have not been lent through refinancing. If the total number of shares of the company returned exceeds 5% of the company&#39;s total share capital, the reduction of the company&#39;s shares shall be subject to the Exchange&#39;s &quot;Detailed Implementation Rules for Share Reductions by Shareholders and Directors, Supervisors and Senior Management Personnel of Listed Companies&quot; and other rules regarding major shareholders. Regulations on reduction of holdings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This means that the number of shares lent by investors through refinancing should also be included in the number of shares when investors reduce their holdings, fundamentally eliminating &quot;detour reduction&quot;. At the same time, the revised rules also prohibit relevant shareholders from participating in short-term trading. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above guidelines show that shareholders who hold more than 5% of the shares of a listed company, do not directly or indirectly increase or decrease the number of shares they hold, and only participate in the refinancing business to lend and withdraw securities within 6 months, shall not Relevant regulations on short-term trading apply. If the company&#39;s shareholding is less than 5% of the total share capital due to participation in refinancing and lending shares, the relevant regulations on short-term trading shall apply to the purchase and sale of stocks and other equity securities during the lending period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 44 of the Securities Law stipulates that if specific entities such as major shareholders, directors, supervisors and senior management of listed companies and companies listed on the New OTC Market engage in short-term trading activities, the proceeds shall belong to the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the above guidelines, the specific situation of shareholders holding 5% of the shares participating in the financing and refinancing business during the reporting period must also be disclosed in the regular report on share changes and shareholder status.&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;The specific information includes the name of the shareholder, the number and proportion of shares held at the beginning of the reporting period, the number and proportion of shares lent through refinancing at the beginning of the reporting period, the number and proportion of shares held at the end of the reporting period, the number and proportion of shares lent through refinancing at the end of the reporting period, etc.&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https ://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 13 Nov 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[肺炎支原体感染潜伏期可达4周 专家：不建议自行给孩子吃阿奇霉素]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260514]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-13 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The National Health Commission held a press conference today (November 13) and invited relevant experts to introduce my country’s winter respiratory tract Information on disease prevention and control. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/0fda3637dda984ac42d2e05636fa7ab6.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;3642&quot; height=&quot;2049&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/0fda3637dda984ac42d2e05636fa7ab6.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258094&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;h4>;Respiratory diseases in our country have entered the season of high incidence, and multiple diseases are intertwined&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Mi Feng, spokesperson of the National Health Commission, said that as winter begins in various places, respiratory diseases have entered the season of high incidence, and many diseases are intertwined. Respiratory diseases are intertwined and superimposed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All localities must adhere to the common prevention and treatment of multiple diseases, follow up on key groups such as the elderly, patients with basic diseases, and children, and optimize vaccination services; they must coordinate medical resources, optimize diagnosis and treatment processes, and strengthen outpatient and emergency care, Pediatrics, respiratory departments and other forces are responsible for various medical treatment work. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The incubation period of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection can be up to 4 weeks&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Wang Quan, chief physician of Beijing Children’s Hospital, said that children are a high-risk population for Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Why are children infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae at a higher rate: &lt; /p>; &lt;p>;① Children’s immune systems are underdeveloped, and their specific and non-specific immune functions are not very mature; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;② Mycoplasma pneumoniae itself is highly transmissible and can be transmitted through respiratory droplets or close contact The incubation period of mycoplasma pneumonia infection is relatively long, usually 1 to 4 weeks, with an average of about 3 weeks. The carriage of pathogens Patients and sick people have certain transmissibility, and there are many opportunities for cross-infection. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;It is not advisable to give children azithromycin and other drugs by themselves&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Wang Quan, chief physician of Beijing Children&#39;s Hospital, said that overall, viruses are still the most common pathogens of children&#39;s respiratory tract infections, and Azithromycin is ineffective and unreasonable against viral infections. In addition, children are young and have underdeveloped organ functions, and drug abuse may cause adverse reactions in children. We would like to remind all parents that children are not smaller versions of adults and should not use medicine at will. They must pay attention to its safety and effectiveness. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;What is the difference between mycoplasma pneumonia and influenza? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Tong Zhaohui, director of the Beijing Institute of Respiratory Diseases, said that the main clinical manifestations of mycoplasma pneumonia are fever and cough. At the onset of the disease, it manifests as severe paroxysmal irritating dry cough, which may be accompanied by Headache, runny nose, sore throat, earache. Compared with previous years, mycoplasma pneumonia has shown a trend of younger patients this year, but the condition has not been significantly aggravated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Influenza is more common in winter and spring. It starts with fever and upper respiratory tract infection, followed by worsening cough, dyspnea and some signs of the lungs, and even more severe systemic symptoms, including high fever, rapid disease progression, and fatigue. , headache, muscle soreness and other symptoms are more obvious. There are some similarities between the two in imaging. Respiratory specimen testing such as detection of type A or type B epidemiological antigens and nucleic acids can be distinguished. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Have respiratory infectious diseases increased this year? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Tong Zhaohui, director of the Beijing Institute of Respiratory Diseases, said that in fact, every winter is the season of high incidence of respiratory infections. Common mycoplasma pneumoniae, respiratory viruses, especially influenza viruses are more active than in summer and spring, leading to an obvious increase in the number of infected people. Increase. Current monitoring data shows that my country has entered the influenza season this year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the COVID-19 epidemic, due to strict respiratory prevention and control measures, the incidence of acute respiratory diseases such as mycoplasma and influenza has indeed declined. With the normalization of prevention and control, these diseases have returned to their pre-epidemic behavior this year. is normal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, combined with the fact that Mycoplasma pneumoniae itself has its own epidemic pattern (cyclical epidemics occur every 3-7 years), mycoplasma pneumonia in children is trending this year. &lt;/p>; &lt;ul>;&lt;/ul>; &lt;h4>;The epidemic situation of new coronavirus infection in my country has shown a fluctuating downward trend recently&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The epidemic situation of new coronavirus infection in my country has recently shown a fluctuating downward trend.

He was called &quot;The Lonely Gourmet&quot; that is more suitable for Chinese babies&#39; physiques. This expressed the wish he expressed in the first video: &quot;Break the dimensional wall, take off the cold and mysterious mask of archeology, and let everyone see the lovely and warm inner nature of this subject.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;span>;What people don’t know is that this archaeologist decided to become a food blogger because he could “dig in the soil” happily. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;1. An archaeologist who only loves food&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Graduated from Peking University undergraduate and social studies A postgraduate student of the Academy of Science and Technology went to the University of California, Los Angeles to get a doctorate. He worked as a researcher for many years and later became a professor at Nanjing University. Zhang Liangren devoted his life to archeology: &quot;he can go to the field and write articles.&quot; He not only does Chinese archeology, Also doing world archeology. In his own words: &quot;The total number of countries he has visited and explored could circle the earth.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It is also Zhang Liangren&#39;s habit to eat wherever he goes. Iranian mutton stew and saffron rice, Russian kebabs, and Siberian grilled fish... all impressed him. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/aac65aaf101d087bf37b6fd4b9685798.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/aac65aaf101d087bf37b6fd4b9685798.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258068 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Zhang Liangren visited Tajikistan in 2011&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;However, Zhang Liangren admitted frankly that he is far from being a qualified &quot;foodie&quot;: he enjoys delicious food, but he has not yet reached the point of searching for delicious food. What really guided him to become a food blogger was his love for archeology. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Last year, Zhang Liangren accidentally opened a monograph &quot;Diet in Chinese Culture&quot; from the 1970s. The editor-in-chief of the book, Zhang Guangzhi, is a famous Chinese archaeologist, anthropologist, and Zhang Liangren’s mentor. The whole book provides a panoramic display and interpretation of China&#39;s food culture. From the pre-Qin Dynasty to the Han, Tang, Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties, how did the characteristics of agricultural society affect the evolution of food on this land? How did Confucian moral concepts and social organization methods determine the Chinese people? cooking and dining habits...&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Zhang Liangren read more than 400 pages in one breath, as if he saw a new door: he has been doing archaeology for a lifetime, and he has been eating for a lifetime. , but never realized that there was such a close connection between the two. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;From then on, eating was no longer just about eating. He could not help but think about it while eating: Why must there be food and rice on the Chinese dining table? &quot;Dual diet&quot;, but Westerners are accustomed to &quot;one plate&quot;? What makes the Chinese form a shared meal system, while Westerners form a divided meal system? When were wheat and tomatoes introduced to China, and how did the stir-fry cooking method come about? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In fact, food archeology is not a brand-new research topic. It is only because food is perishable and cannot be preserved in the long history, and it is too difficult to excavate that it leads to There are very few people doing relevant research in the global archaeological community, and even fewer in China. But Zhang Liangren decided that he would face the difficulties. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Just do it. This year, Zhang Liangren recruited two students to specialize in dietary archeology, hoping to unearth more dietary cultural relics and fill the gaps in archaeological research. Zhang Liangren has always had an academic ideal: to let the world hear the voice of the Chinese archaeological community. &quot;The first is to publish Chinese archeology abroad, and the second is to participate more in international archeology and contribute to world archeology.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;For this reason, he has Single-handedly initiated archaeological projects of Sino-Russian and Sino-Iranian cooperation. The Iranian team adopted the European excavation method, digging straight down like a deep well. Zhang Liangren felt that this area was too small and too inefficient, so he persuaded the other party to use the Chinese trench excavation method. The results were remarkable and were not only published in international journals. The paper attracted the attention of academic circles and was visited by members of the Iranian Congress. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;How to make cold knowledge more pyrotechnic? Letting more people realize the value of archaeological history is something Zhang Liangren and his friends around him often discuss. In July this year, with the help of several friends, Zhang Liangren opened his own Douyin account and started to explore food stores. Zhang Liangren is responsible for the appearance, and friends are responsible for filming and production. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;He made no secret that the reason why he came up with the idea of ​​making short videos was to spread knowledge to the public, and the other original intention was to &quot;expand awareness&quot; and let more people People know the value of archeology and support archaeological research in more ways. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;2. Pour some cold water on young people who want to study archeology&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Zhang Liangren The video is full of the fireworks of life and has a sense of history. He picked up a mouthful of duck blood vermicelli soup and said that this vermicelli soup has only a few decades of history, but from a can of duck eggs unearthed from a mound tomb in Jurong, Jiangsu, it can be seen that the tradition of eating waterfowl in Jiangsu dates back to 2,500 years ago. It started years ago. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It is also interesting to examine the origin of imitation meat vegetarian food. Emperor Liang Wu of the Han Dynasty issued an &quot;administrative order&quot; requiring monks to stop drinking and eating. The need to be both vegetarian and satisfy one&#39;s cravings led later generations to use their brains and develop meat-like vegetarian food that can mimic meat. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Although the image in the video is humorous and friendly, Zhang Liangren waved his hands and laughed at himself, saying that he is an &quot;old scholar&quot; who spends all day burying his head in old papers and not listening to what is going on outside the window. He is good at academic research, digging soil, and giving lectures; reviewing video scripts and embedding historical knowledge can also be regarded as an extension of his professional skills. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Only appearing on camera is a big problem: &quot;I am a person who is not good at words, and I cannot speak Mandarin well.&quot; In the first few videos, his eyes were habitually Avoid the camera and look away. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;But what can stump a true &quot;old scholar&quot;? He began to use his scholarly spirit to make short videos, and specially hired an announcer to train himself to correct his pronunciation, improve his intonation and language rhythm, and practice facing the camera. Now, although he is still a little green and awkward, he can already look directly into the camera, clearly tell the history behind the food, and even make some funny expressions and movements to interact with the imaginary audience. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The contrast between &quot;old scholar&quot; and various current buzzwords, the fresh combination of historical knowledge and gourmet temptations, and the high-frequency output of updates every two days make the book more interesting. Zhang Liangren became a &quot;top leader&quot; in the archaeological community in just over two months. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;But compared with the increased traffic figures, what makes him even more happy is that many ordinary people will leave messages or private messages asking questions related to archeology and history. &quot;More people are interested in We are interested in archeology.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many young students also left messages: Can they take the postgraduate entrance examination for professors? Zhang Liangren will be more cautious towards this type of fans. On the one hand, he is pleased that more young people want to join the archaeological industry; on the other hand, he has to remind them that doing research and popular science are not the same thing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/769ecce1cc954fdc3f13291282e16804.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1597&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/769ecce1cc954fdc3f13291282e16804.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258066 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;The history of fried dough sticks&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Zhang Liangren has long noticed , in recent years, with the broadcast of film and television programs such as &quot;I Repair Cultural Relics in the Forbidden City&quot; and &quot;National Treasure&quot;, archeology has gradually entered the public eye. Many of his own students were influenced by these programs and decided to apply for the archeology major. The first lesson he taught these young students was to pour cold water on them: &quot;Break their romantic imagination of archeology - TV programs present the most interesting and accomplished aspects of this subject, but behind the fun and achievements, It is extremely long and hard work. If you can’t stand the loneliness, don’t enter this industry.”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In fact, it took Zhang Liangren himself many years to fall in love with archeology. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/70be4fd89711527d9429c6a323807c0b.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;870&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/70be4fd89711527d9429c6a323807c0b.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258069 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Let more people understand archeology&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;When I took the exam When he was in college, he had no idea what his interests were, so he muddleheadedly applied for the Department of Archeology. During his undergraduate and postgraduate years, Zhang Liangren spent his time attending classes, reading materials, and writing papers. It was difficult and boring, just like the public&#39;s stereotype of archeology. It wasn’t until I started to come into contact with a large number of historical materials from all over the world during my PhD studies and participated in field surveys and excavations around the world that I felt the joy of this subject. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The part that he enjoys the most is the most feared &quot;digging&quot; part of archeology: sleeping in the open air, exposed to the sun and rain, under the pressure of scholars Title, doing heavy physical work. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“I like this kind of life to explore in inaccessible places, bask in the sun, look at the scenery, and breathe fresh air.” Moreover, compared to sitting in the library and studying Archeology can always surprise him with the achievements of predecessors and the first-hand information that is freshly excavated and stained with real historical dust, inspiring him to discover new problems. &quot;I am very excited and not boring at all.&quot;&lt;/span >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;So, after using a basin of cold water to extinguish the romantic imagination of young people, he will use the true connotation of this subject to &quot;warm&quot; them back - after all, he has given This introductory course for freshmen is called &quot;The Archeology of Charm.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;3. Curiosity is the answer&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;History The Xianlin campus where the department is located is 20 to 30 kilometers away from downtown Nanjing. After working here for nearly ten years, Zhang Liangren’s life trajectory has never exceeded five kilometers around the campus. He mainly eats in the school cafeteria, and goes out to hang out when friends come. A meal as a supplement. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;But since he became a food blogger, he &quot;goes to the city to eat delicious food&quot; every day, and has even become a food trendsetter in Nanjing&#39;s archaeological circles. His colleagues always ask questions when they see him. One sentence: Which restaurant have you been to recently? He thought, how could he ignore so many delicious foods in Jinling, the capital of gourmet food? This kind of shop-hopping life seems to be pretty good. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This career, which was originally just a means of &quot;saving the country through curves,&quot; now takes up a little more time every week than teaching. He has already begun to make long-term plans: after exploring Nanjing cuisine, he will also explore national cuisine, and then world cuisine; not only cooking food, but also introducing other archaeological related knowledge, such as the two issues of &quot;Three Whitening Tips of the Ancients&quot; and &quot;A 400-degree myopic guide to traveling through ancient times.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/711d7624ee4cef048393ea6b7813f995.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;722&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/711d7624ee4cef048393ea6b7813f995.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258070 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Zhang Liangren participated in excavations in Russia in 2019&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;One The video shooting session, which initially made him feel uncomfortable, gradually became more comfortable. Only then did he realize that those food programs on TV were all &quot;acted&quot;. &quot;A plate of meat was filmed at different angles for 20 minutes. When you eat it, it&#39;s cold in your mouth, and you have to act like it&#39;s delicious. What about &quot;Journey to the West&quot; &quot;The flat peach eaten by Sun Wukong in &quot;Water Margin&quot; could not be a real flat peach, and the bowl of wine Wu Song drank before fighting the tiger in &quot;Water Margin&quot; could not be a real bar? In order to stay awake, the actor must have drank water.&quot; He analyzed seriously. , as if he had discovered some incredible truth, which made the young man opposite him laugh. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Originally, he wanted to &quot;facilitate&quot; archeology to the public. Unexpectedly, in the process, the daily life of the public unknowingly entered his pile of old papers, which made this old scholar Got caught up in the fireworks and became a &quot;slash professor&quot; at the age of 58. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Now he can answer the question: What is the connection between archeology and daily life? Zhang Liangren’s answer is: curiosity. Whether it’s archaeology, gourmet food or being a short video blogger, it’s curiosity that pushes him to move forward. This experience can also be extended to other humans. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“People are curious and want to know where they come from and where they are going, so everyone likes to go to museums and see ruins and cultural relics. And archeology It provides a kind of tangible history that can be seen directly with the eyes, which is more intuitive than the history presented in words. It is not only a key to the historical truth, but also an entrance to explore the development laws of human society.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Nowadays, Zhang Liangren will tell his students that academic issues must be related to things that the people care about. Because there is a lot of fun in the world, and you can get it as long as you are willing to &quot;dig&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 13 Nov 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“能用的条文总是这么少”，专家呼吁立法解决网暴治理“九龙治水”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260501]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-13 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The governance of online violence needs to be solved urgently The problem is that the legislation is too fragmented.

Another Weibo user, Sun, was involved in a dispute over a current affairs issue. Liu had a different view and sent insulting words to Liu through Weibo private messages. Liu posted Sun&#39;s private messages, Weibo account, photos and other information on Weibo, along with insulting remarks, triggering online violence against Sun from netizens. In the end, the court ruled that Liu had infringed the law and deleted the Weibo and comments involved in the case that infringed on Sun&#39;s portrait and reputation. Both parties apologized to each other in writing, and the amount of mental damage compensation was offset by each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Liu Yanhong previously wrote that netizens who posted negative comments to insult Sun could have been held liable for civil infringement and administrative liability for disrupting online order, but in the judicial process In law enforcement practice, such acts committed by non-initiators and non-organizers are generally ignored. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;On the other hand, for the current governance of cyber violence, there are relevant provisions in the Civil Code, Criminal Law, Administrative Penalty Law and other laws and regulations that can be used, but different laws Each has its own value orientation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&quot;Generally speaking, the current legislation on the governance of cyber violence is like a flood in Kowloon.&quot; She advocates comprehensive and progressive legislation, such as being first formulated by the State Council. Regulations on the Prevention and Control of Cyber ​​Violence, followed by legislation on the prevention and control of cyber violence, and finally the establishment of an organic law for cyber violence governance agencies, and finally the unified rise to the Anti-Cyber ​​Violence Law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Wang Sixin, deputy director of the Research Institute of a Community with a Shared Future for Mankind at Communication University of China, also said that step-by-step legislation is more likely to achieve practical results. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;To prevent platform abuse of power&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;At the seminar, Some scholars also warned that we should be cautious about anti-cyber violence legislation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&quot;The governance of online violence is essentially the governance of speech.&quot; Zhi Zhenfeng, a researcher at the Institute of Law, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that for normal criticism and Supervision and discussion of different opinions should be protected. &quot;Online violence must be controlled, but everyone&#39;s rights to speech and expression must also be protected.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;As to how to distinguish normal online criticism from illegal online violence, Shi Jiayou, a professor at Renmin University of China, said that subjectively speaking, online criticism is generally well-intentioned and its purpose is Often it is about safeguarding public interests or one&#39;s own legitimate rights and interests. From an objective point of view, Internet criticism is generally based on basic facts. The facts criticized are generally well-founded or have reasonable information channels, and are not groundless or randomly fabricated; even if the facts confirmed in the end are different from the initial There are discrepancies or partial inaccuracies in the critical remarks, but as long as the critical remarks do have an objective basis as a whole and the critic has reasonable grounds to believe in the authenticity of the facts cited, then the critical remarks should be considered to be a reasonable exercise of freedom of speech. scope. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Therefore, Zhi Zhenfeng emphasized that the focus of combating cyber violence should be organized manipulation of public opinion. “For example, behind cyber thugs and cyber trolls, there are often Organized ones, where one organization can control dozens or millions of accounts at the same time, as well as overseas account matrices involving national security, are all targets that should be targeted.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In addition, he believes that as a platform that builds a public opinion space, it has an obligation to maintain the order of the public opinion space. &quot;The platform has technical strength and can intervene through front-end and make samples.&quot; Use database modeling and other technologies to control cyber violence.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Professor Wang Limei from the Data Law Institute of China University of Political Science and Law added this. She believes that platforms should first improve the real-name system, which can be based on the different natures of the platform and spokespersons. , implement front-end or back-end real-name. Secondly, platforms should set up preventive technical measures so that those who are cyberviolated can trigger the protection mechanism with “one click”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;However, Zhi Zhenfeng said that it seems that the platform has been imposed obligations, but in fact it has been given power. &quot;Then will the platform abuse this?&quot; Power, to make the already uneven power between the platform and users even more imbalanced? I have found that some platforms use the banner of supervision to delete posts that they do not like.&quot; He reminded that attention should be paid to preventing platforms from abusing their power and controlling speech. Abnormal market manipulation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 13 Nov 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[犹太人向左，以色列向右：从知识分子幼稚病到游民心态]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260503]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-13 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A new round of Palestinian-Israeli conflict broke out, which also caused shock in the United States. The American intelligentsia has a tradition of sympathizing with Palestine and boycotting Israel. At this time, the mainstream media in the United States basically no longer criticized Israel for retaliation, but instead condemned Hamas as never before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also a few student organizations in American universities that refuse to condemn Hamas and continue to target Israel. In response, many Jewish entrepreneurs announced in a high-profile manner that they would cut off funding for these universities. The influence of wealthy Jewish people and Jewish organizations in the United States far exceeds its population ratio. This is regarded as another example of &quot;Jews exerting the power of money.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The current Israeli government is governed by the Likud Group and a group of center-right parties. The Likud Group is the right-wing core of Israeli politics. The current Prime Minister Netanyahu and the famous military strongman Sharon are all representatives of this party. It seems that this is an echo of right-wing Jews in Israel and abroad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, people who are familiar with international relations know that Jews as a group are generally not right-wing, but are famous for being left-leaning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The contemporary American political left is the liberal wing represented by the Democratic Party. There are approximately 6 million Jews in the United States, the largest number of Jews outside Israel. The vast majority of Jews vote for Democrats in every election, and this has been the case for more than a hundred years. &quot;Jews side with the Democrats&quot; is common sense in the political arena. As everyone knows, black people are the die-hard vote base of Democrats. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the Republican Party&#39;s firm support for Israel, Democrats continue to criticize Israel. They often criticize the Israeli government&#39;s tough methods and ruthless style, and demand ceasefire and peace talks. American Jews&#39; criticism of the Israeli government is even more intense. On October 16, two American Jewish groups launched a large-scale protest. Hundreds of people rushed into the White House waving Palestinian flags and demanded that the United States urge Israel to cease fire. This farce was so angry that Israel called them &quot;Jewish traitors&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although American public opinion generally supports Israel this time, in the long run, most Jews in the United States are still critics of the Israeli government, sponsors of American universities that are the stronghold of liberals, and have basically nothing to do with the so-called right. Even within Israel, the left has a strong presence. After the establishment of the state of Israel, the left-wing Labor Party has been in power for more than thirty years. At the end of the 20th century, the Likud Party rose and had to form a coalition with the Labor Party to govern. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you extend the time and broaden your horizons, you will find that the left-wing color of the Jews is too strong to be ignored. Whether in times of peace or war, Jews as a whole lean left. This means that they are &quot;restless&quot;, like construction, love sports, have radical political leanings, and pursue &quot;equality&quot; economically. Why do the Jewish people have such characteristics? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, it is related to the experience of the Jewish nation. After the Jews lost their country, they have been wandering throughout history. They have used scriptures and religious organizations to unite the ethnic group, rarely integrating into the local ethnic groups and culture (the Kaifeng Jews in history are an exception), and their relationship with the local people is somewhat estranged, and there is no negotiation. . Many Jews hope to establish a new country where everyone is &quot;equal&quot;, which is related to their messianic religious tradition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the rise of Zionism, a large number of Russian and Eastern European Jews rushed to Canaan, becoming the seeds of Israel&#39;s revival and founding. Israeli agriculture includes kibbutzim and moshav, which are collective agricultural cooperatives; industry is a mixed economic system dominated by state-owned enterprises. Diplomatically, Israel opposed colonialism. During the Cold War, Israel turned to the United States and became its ally in the Middle East. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In today&#39;s Israel, although the left wing is still a considerable force, it has faded much compared to the early days of the founding of the country. In a harsh environment surrounded by powerful enemies in the Middle East, Israel has taken some measures to turn to the right. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kibbutz farms have begun to be privatized, their economic role is weakening, and their community functions are increasing. Israeli agriculture no longer relies on collectivization, but relies on science and technology to develop modern agriculture. Mixed ownership, in which state-owned enterprises account for a large proportion, has also transitioned to privatization, with private enterprises becoming the main force in the economy. Israel encourages entrepreneurship and attracts foreign investment, making the country a technological and entrepreneurial powerhouse in the Middle East. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to attract overseas Jews to return and provide financial support, Israel continues to strengthen its national and religious identity. Compromising with the ultra-Orthodox and granting non-soldiers the privilege of not being educated is largely to treat them as the &quot;condensation core&quot; of the Jewish nation. The Israeli government&#39;s financial support for the ultra-Orthodox is also related to the high birth rate among the ultra-Orthodox. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, the Israeli government promulgated the &quot;Jewish Nation-State Law.&quot; Article 1 of the law stipulates that Israel is the historical home of the Jewish people and the nation-state of the Jewish people, and Hebrew is the official language of Israel (removing the official status of Arabic). This approach of strengthening ethnic distinctions runs counter to Western political correctness, and Netanyahu&#39;s government has been criticized as &quot;extreme right&quot; for this reason. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The left-wing forces in Israel reached their peak in the early days of the founding of the country, but have declined since then. By the 21st century, left-wing parties have basically lost their governing position. At the same time, Israeli Jews abroad fully embraced American left-wing culture and became the backbone of liberal circles. This divide is related to another reason why Jews tend to lean toward the left. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Jews have a good educational tradition (from the priestly class tradition), the overall cultural level is high, and a large number of intellectuals have emerged. In the field of natural sciences, outstanding achievements of Jewish scientists can often be seen. More Jews entered the intellectual class and became doctors, lawyers, professors, reporters, editors, artists and professional managers. Since the last century, the proportion of Jews in knowledge industries in European and American countries has been very high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Jews, whose number is not very large, are the nation with the highest proportion of intellectuals in the world. This is a remarkable achievement. Problems arise. Certain problems among intellectuals (especially those in the humanities and social sciences) are evident among the Jewish community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a kind of childish disease among intellectuals, who are often obsessed with creating theories and are divorced from reality. They are eager to build a better world, but they are not very concerned about the costs and resistance in the real world, so they can only rely on the state to push it forward. Paying attention to plan construction and ignoring daily experience often results in disaster. Intellectuals often show love and compassion, and their exaggerated &quot;moral sense&quot; obscures rational thinking, which often makes them fall into sincere stupidity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jews cannot avoid these intellectual problems. They move around various countries, lack the accumulation of ancestral property in the countryside, are excluded by mainstream society, and can easily develop a &quot;nomad mentality.&quot; The homeless are dissatisfied with the existing order, lack feelings for the local culture, and lack interest in establishing and continuing their families. They just want quick success, and the loosening and disintegration of the old order is obviously to their advantage. The more wandering Jewish intellectuals are, the easier it is for them to create and spread radical ideas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chinese thinker Mencius once said, &quot;Those who have permanent property have perseverance, and those who do not have perseverance have no perseverance. If you don&#39;t have perseverance, you will do whatever it takes to ward off evil.&quot; This can also explain why many new immigrant groups are &quot;vagrants&quot; Mentality&quot;, while native peoples or old immigrants who have been rooted for generations tend to tend towards conservatism. Once wealthy Jewish businessmen from all over the world have taken root in a certain place for generations and have deep-rooted industries, they will also move closer to conservatives. The five wealthy Jewish business families in Hong Kong are considered to be old Hong Kongers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Look back at Israel. Most of Israel&#39;s early immigrants were left-wing intellectuals. After a few generations, the law of &quot;perseverance comes to those who have perseverance&quot; began to take effect. Compared with overseas Jews, the local people have a long-term view and are pragmatic and cold-blooded in their approach. Many native Jews moved to the right. Diaspora Jews lack this sense of belonging, and intellectuals continue their left-leaning inertia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today’s diaspora Jews, especially young people, are almost liberal. They have complicated feelings about Israel. On the one hand, they recognize that Israel is the motherland to which they belong, and that a strong Israel can effectively deter anti-Semitic countercurrents. They also feel that the current Israeli government is too barbaric, cruel and inhumane. In every Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the protesters at the forefront are young Jewish people. However, this time, they paid a heavy price for their sincerity and kindness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The music festival tragedy stung many Western Jews. This is why wealthy American Jews and Jewish organizations immediately stopped funding universities when they heard they refused to condemn Hamas. Despite this, the public opinion of the American Jewish community is still left-leaning, and their habit of firmly supporting the Democratic Party may be difficult to change. The trend of &quot;Jews moving to the left and Israel moving to the right&quot; will continue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, it is emphasized that Jews as a whole are left-leaning, and there are still Jews who are moving toward the &quot;right&quot; ideological path. Mises and Hayek, the masters who defended the free market, both have Jewish ancestry; Friedman, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics and popularized market common sense to the public, and libertarian philosopher Ayn Rand, they are also Jews. There are also many Jews in European and American intellectual circles who have deeply reflected on the shortcomings of Jewish leftism. These wise men who transcend the limitations of national psychology deserve more attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 13 Nov 2023 15:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[果敢同盟军为什么这么能打，他们打仗的钱又是哪来的？丨军事]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260332]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-13 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/08/4Xu03XgA21c9Frt8lwYWw3yzX5mJWg3WxMlVOdBF.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/4Xu03XgA21c9Frt8lwYWw3yz X5mJWg3WxMlVOdBF. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257400&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;October 28, 2023, Qingshui River, Myanmar, Myanmar October 28, 2023 On the Qingshui River in Myanmar, members of the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army took a group photo with members of the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army on Qianshao Mountain and weapons seized from the Myanmar army on Qianshao Mountain &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 27, 2023, Myanmar’s ethnic local armed forces headed by the Kokang National Democratic Alliance Army launched a military operation called “1027 Joint Operation” to cooperate with the Myanmar military in Fierce fighting broke out in Lashio, Guidai and other places in northern Myanmar. A few days ago, Myanmar military government spokesman Zaw Min Tun has admitted that the Qingshui River in the China-Myanmar border area has been occupied by the Allied Forces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fighting in northern Shan State has intensified since the alliance announced a full-scale offensive on the Kokang region, with an ethnic minority alliance claiming to have captured four towns and dozens of military posts, blocking access to China. trade routes. And continue to destroy roads, communication facilities and bridges used by government forces to support the Shan State front line. This has forced the Myanmar military to rely on air transportation to support Lao Cai, the capital of Kokang, including using helicopters to transport supplies, pick up the wounded and family members of senior officials, and even airdrop special operations personnel to strengthen defenses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This can be said to be the biggest military challenge faced by Myanmar&#39;s military government since Aung San Suu Kyi was captured by the army in 2021. As we all know, during the Spring Festival in 2015, the Kokang Allied Forces launched a military operation in an attempt to counterattack the Kokang Autonomous Region, which they had lost since 2009. However, the operation failed due to the full stranglehold of the Burmese army, and they were forced to evacuate the Kokang area and continued to attack along the Salween River. Fighting in the Hongyan guerrilla zone. At present, it seems that the intensity and progress of the Kokang Allied Forces&#39; attack on Kokang this time are significantly greater than those in 2015. Therefore, many people are puzzled by the increased strength of the Allied Forces. Various conspiracy theories have even arisen around this question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why does the Kokang Allied Forces seem to have increased in strength, and why is this offensive so powerful? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the Kokang Allied Forces did not suddenly become stronger. In the attack on Lao Cai in 2015, the three main brigades of the Allied Forces performed quite well. Not only does it have very strong mobile warfare capabilities, but it is also quite skilled in long-range sniping. Such combat effectiveness is inseparable from the long-term mountain guerrilla warfare after the Allied Forces were reestablished in 2010. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, no matter how strong the combat effectiveness is, the army also needs a sufficient economic base to support it. The outside world knows very little about the financial resources of the Kokang Allied Forces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are rumors on the Internet that the Kokang Allied Forces have been fighting guerrillas in the virgin forest since 2009. In fact, it still maintains a relatively fixed base area, namely the famous Hongyan District, located in the eastern part of the Red Star District of the Kokang Special Administrative Region. Adjacent to the China-Myanmar border, the Nu River and Baihu Mountain cover an area of ​​approximately 36 square kilometers. In addition to the base areas within Kokang territory, the Kokang Allied Forces also have other footholds. The Fourth Special Administrative Region in eastern Shan State has allowed the alliance leadership and some troops to enter since 2009. The current government chairman of the Fourth Special Administrative Region, Lin Mingxian, is the son-in-law of Peng Jiasheng, the founder of the Kokang Alliance Army. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the areas controlled by the Kokang Allied Forces, they can raise funds through taxation and border trade. In addition, the Kokang Allied Forces also control some docks in the Salween River and Mekong River basins, which can be used for material transfer and to collect tolls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, after the Kokang conflict in 2015, because the Kokang Alliance Army showed quite good combat effectiveness in the conflict, it was regarded as a backer by other surrounding ethnic and local armed forces. These ethnic and local armed forces began to support the Kokang Alliance. The military directly provides economic support and logistical supplies. The Kokang Alliance Army, the Arakan Army, and the Ta&#39;ang Liberation Army further formed the famous Three Brothers Alliance (3BHA) in 2017. Subsequently, they often cooperated with each other to fight, and they also shared their financial and logistical needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both Rakhine and De&#39;ang have their own stable and controlled base areas, and the base areas have the economic foundation of primary and secondary industries such as jade and jade, minerals, mahogany, tea, agricultural products, sugar cane and sugar, and also have Border trade, specialty tourism and other tertiary industries, so the economic situation is naturally much better than that of the Kokang Allied Forces with a small base area. Their support for the Kokang Alliance undoubtedly strengthened the entire alliance in general. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the Three Brothers Alliance, the United Wa State Army and the Kachin Independence Army, as the two largest ethnic local armed forces in northern Myanmar, also have considerable support for the Three Brothers Alliance. The local armed forces have certain military manufacturing capabilities and can produce light weapons, ammunition and even light artillery on their own. Many of the logistical equipment of the local armed factions of various ethnic groups in northern Myanmar rely on the support of the Kachin and Wa States. The late founder of the Kokang Alliance Army, Peng Jiasheng, also had good personal relationships with leaders of the Kachin and Wa states. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, there is a core demand behind the support of the Kokang Alliance Army by ethnic and local armed forces in the region, that is, they hope that the Kokang Alliance Army can bear more pressure when the Myanmar government forces attack. After all, the other forces have stable bases and ethnic populations. Fighting with the government forces is not conducive to the development of local people&#39;s livelihood. The Kokang Allied Forces have lost their &quot;hometown&quot; and have a small remaining territory. They also want to &quot;fight back home&quot;, so they are obviously more willing to spare their efforts. For the Kokang Allied Forces, even if they lose the Hongyan base, the worst they can do is continue to fight guerrillas in the guerrilla zone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the news footage of this &quot;Operation 1027&quot;, the Kokang Allied Forces have not significantly improved their equipment. Although some weapons have been updated, they are still various light weapons common in northern Myanmar. As for combat equipment, helmets and new military uniforms, they are also low-end private products that can be bought everywhere. In terms of personnel recruitment, in recent years due to the internal divisions of the Bamar ethnic group, the Kokang Allied Forces have also begun to recruit non-Kokang soldiers. For example, the 611 Brigade established in 2022, most of the members are non-Kokang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The biggest upgrade in weapons and equipment of the Kokang Alliance this time is actually the drone, but it is also a common commercial model. In recent years, anti-government forces have begun to use drones extensively in Myanmar&#39;s civil war, especially after the military government captured Aung San Suu Kyi. The People&#39;s Defense Force (PDF) formed by Aung San&#39;s supporters has quite a bit of knowledge from Myanmar universities. Molecules and technologists who are able to build their own drones by purchasing parts. These also include fixed-wing drones with corrugated skins, which are almost invisible to radar because they have very few metal parts. The local ethnic armed forces in northern Myanmar also often use this kind of drone as a patrol missile, and it is said that the actual combat effect is good. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After 2015, the Kokang Alliance Army assumed a role similar to that of the vanguard army and training team of ethnic local armed forces in the region. Through continuous actual combat, it opened up the situation on the one hand and helped train personnel of other friendly neighboring forces on the other. , so the combat effectiveness has been very stable. In March 2017, the Kokang Allied Forces attacked the Lao Cai Casino, causing more than 30 casualties and sweeping away the casino&#39;s treasury. After exchanging fire with the Myanmar government troops and pro-government local armed forces who came to support, they escaped unscathed. Therefore, before the conflict broke out on October 27, 2023, the Kokang Allied Forces were likely to have the strength to directly attack Lao Cai, and what they were waiting for might be a suitable opportunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 13 Nov 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[老师，你为什么不让孩子课间离开教室？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260452]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-13 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;As a primary school teacher, I feel that there are a lot of hot news in the education sector recently. First, the &quot;ten minutes of silence between classes&quot; sparked heated discussion, and then the teacher&#39;s heavy burden of &quot;non-teaching tasks&quot; also became a hot search topic. Earlier, a school charged 200 yuan for a lunch break, which was also controversial. These things seem to me to be inextricably linked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some children were imprisoned in the classroom or even on their seats during recess, which made netizens sad. Recalling the free recess in their childhood, they couldn&#39;t help but ask: Why can&#39;t today&#39;s children be unrestrained during recess? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some media pointed out that some parents are to blame for their tendency to hold schools accountable. In order to reduce safety accidents, the school adopted a simple and crude &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach and banned running and jumping activities during recess. As for chronic consequences such as slow development of athletic ability and lack of social interaction, the school cannot take care of it. Therefore, the media called for loosening school management and dividing responsibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Parents holding schools accountable is indeed a pain in the ass for teachers. During a recess not long ago, two girls in my class were holding hands and spinning in circles. Later, the game was upgraded and they started spinning back to back. It was originally a warm and beautiful scene, but during acceleration, a girl fell to the ground, and her two front teeth were unfortunately shattered. I saw all this clearly, but it was through the video in the corridor. When the incident happened, I was downstairs, leading another class in physical education class across subjects. The student&#39;s teeth have become permanent teeth, and the parents are very worried. I reported it to the school step by step, and the safety office said after analysis that it was not a safety incident, but an accident that occurred while playing between classmates, and the parents of both parties could just negotiate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The parents of the girl who played together proposed that the treatment costs should be split equally between the two parties. However, the parents of the injured girl said that because the accident happened at school, the school should also be responsible. I was dealing with three parties and was very embarrassed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Parents are not unreasonable. In European and American countries where we often learn from educational experience, schools should theoretically be held responsible for accidents on campus. It&#39;s just that most parents don&#39;t tend to hold the school accountable. Instead, they negotiate on their own with the mentality that bumps and pains are inevitable in their children&#39;s growth. Campus accident insurance in these countries has wider coverage and can effectively reduce the financial burden on all parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I believe that in addition to the soft conditions of division of powers and responsibilities, hard conditions such as teacher-student ratio, school hours and campus venues are also important reasons that affect students’ freedom between classes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 3, Xinhua News Agency published an article titled &quot;The Ministry of Education Responds to the Problem of Being Restrained for 10 Minutes Between Classes.&quot; The article proposed that schools should &quot;strengthen the inspection of outdoor facilities and personnel on duty...minimize the risk of safety accidents and allow children to be happy and safe in their activities.&quot; This reasonable sentence made my heart rise in my throat: &quot;Personnel on duty.&quot; , what kind of personnel are they? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our school has never prohibited students from recess activities due to safety reasons, although chasing and fighting is absolutely prohibited. However, if there is an outbreak of influenza in a class, in order to avoid cross-infection, teachers and students will become tense during class breaks: teachers must take turns in the toilets and corridors, reminding students to wash their hands with hand sanitizer after going to the toilet, and not to stay in the corridors; The teacher should hand over the class and ensure that the classroom is supervised. The scope of students&#39; activities has been reduced, and teachers&#39; class breaks have been filled up, leaving no time for rest. Some colleagues have sprained while rushing to a classroom on another campus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many teachers often ask on various social media: &quot;When can teachers only do the job of teaching and educating people?&quot; Is it the teacher&#39;s job to take care of students during breaks? The incident of charging for lunch break while lying on the table clearly shows the contradiction behind this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As soon as the hot search came out, staff from the relevant departments responded quickly, saying that the charges were reasonable and approved by the government. Lunch break charges mainly take into account the overtime wages of teachers after class, and even if there is a fee subsidy, many teachers are not willing to pay for lunch breaks. Public opinion did not buy it, and netizens were confused: students take lunch breaks on their own, why do they need teachers to take care of them? Aren&#39;t we going to rest together? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not to mention that some schools do not allow custodial teachers to take breaks. Even if the school is &quot;lenient&quot;, after settling more than 30 or 40 students, then taking a while to relax is definitely not the same as taking a lunch break on your own. Feel. When students take lunch breaks at school, they essentially create a large class break; as long as students are in school, they are the school&#39;s safety responsibility, and the teachers are directly responsible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The government or school can purchase teachers’ lunch breaks through subsidies to ensure student safety. However, in the scattered classes, it is impossible for teachers to go to outdoor places with students in order to arrive at the classroom for the next class on time or to have a little communication with students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In developed countries, teachers do take care of recess and lunch breaks, but most of them adopt a class-based system, with &quot;one teacher per class&quot; and teachers follow the class. In our country, teachers are divided by subjects, and teachers need to teach across classes and grades. Traveling between different classrooms or even campuses often consumes an entire class period, and caring for students during class time has become an &quot;unbearable burden.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The advantages of the private class system are significant: teachers have a more comprehensive understanding of students, and teachers and students can form deeper connections; multi-subject teaching is conducive to cultivating students&#39; interdisciplinary awareness and avoiding teacher burnout. Why is it difficult to implement it in our country? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the examination selection system puts the pressure down to primary schools. Teachers who only focus on one subject can be more familiar with the &quot;test points&quot; and make it easier to take the test. Secondly, most European and American countries adopt small class teaching. Taking the ordinary public primary school where I am as an example, there are no less than 50 students in each class. Finally, most primary schools in Europe and the United States only have half-day classes. After teachers watch the students for half a day, they have complete time to prepare lessons in the afternoon. In order to match the work schedule of our parents, primary school students can stay in school for up to ten hours, from morning reading to lunch break and extended services. If a teacher has to take care of 50 students for a full day of classes and care, not to mention the mental stress, there will be absolutely no time for correcting homework and preparing lessons. What&#39;s more, teachers already have too many non-teaching tasks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Insufficient campus space is also one of the important reasons for restricting students’ freedom between classes. At this stage, the number of students is large and the campus is large. In cities where land is at a premium, school teaching buildings often have four or five floors. In order to cope with the pressure from the Education Bureau to expand enrollment, many old schools have expanded their original areas: the buildings have been built higher, but the playground and basketball courts are often still the same size as they were decades ago. As a result, even several classes in the physical education class had to compete for seats, not to mention the students swarming out during the ten-minute break. If you rush to the basketball court from the fourth or fifth floor, the ready bell will ring again before the ball is touched. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, except for the lucky ones whose classrooms are on the first floor, most students’ activity space is limited to the corridor outside the classroom door. If many students are running in such a small space, the probability of stampedes and collisions is unimaginable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, the birth rate in our country is declining, which may become an opportunity to implement the &quot;package system&quot;. However, along with the decline in the birth rate, there is also an increase in parents&#39; work pressure and an increase in social costs of raising children. It is difficult to change quickly the length of time students are in school and financial investment in education, and it is also difficult to change quickly the planning of outdoor space on campus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the current conditions, I have some immature attempts at recess: teaching children physical games that do not require a large space, such as &quot;carrot squat&quot;, &quot;rock paper scissors&quot; for feet, etc.; Take turns using flying chess and other toys. At the school level, it may be possible to adjust more 15-minute &quot;big breaks&quot; and organize classes to take turns going downstairs; if there is financial resources, break managers can be hired to strengthen care. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public public opinion’s attention to recess activities reflects the rising national attention to education. But returning recess to students cannot be solved simply by calling on schools to relax their hands and parents not to criticize teachers harshly. Only by improving the safety of students&#39; recess activities, expanding the space for recess activities, taking away some responsibilities from teachers and returning teachers to students can we truly allow students to run freely during recess. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a primary school teacher in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010; &quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The &quot;hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of Southern Weekend App is looking forward to your contributions.
