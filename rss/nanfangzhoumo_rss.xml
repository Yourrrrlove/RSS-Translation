Since my country’s Khunjerab Port does not allow cycling to pass customs, I need to take a transit bus in Taxkorgan County, check the bicycle as luggage, and continue riding after arriving at Khunjerab National Park on the Pakistani side. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Khunjerab Pass is 4,783 meters above sea level. On one side of the border with my country is the wide-open and wide-open valley terrain of the eastern Pamir Plateau. The climate is arid and the vegetation is sparse. It is rare to see a tree at the foot of the mountain. Surrounded by a courtyard wall - it is a family of Tajik herders; entering Pakistan, it quickly transforms into a valley terrain with surging rapids - this is a canyon cut by the Hunza River in the southeastern part of the Pamir Plateau. It collided left and right in the mountain knot formed by the intersection of the Karakoram Mountains, Himalayas and Hindu Kush Mountains, and fell rapidly. From the border line of Khunjerab Pass to the entrance of Khunjerab National Park where Pakistan conducts border inspection, it is a short 40-kilometer journey, and the altitude drops by about one thousand meters; from the border inspection to Sost, the Pakistani port ), a distance of about 38 kilometers, and the altitude has dropped by nearly a thousand meters - which is naturally great news for cyclists. By the time I rode all the way downhill to the Ganish village in the eastern part of the Hunza Valley, the altitude had dropped to about 2,400 meters, which was only half of the Khunjerab Pass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not far south of Ganish, I saw a pedestrian rope bridge flying north and south over the raging Hunza River, and a warm current suddenly surged in my heart - more than 1,200 years ago , Gao Xianzhi, a famous general in the Tang Dynasty, used a similar rope bridge in the lower reaches of this river to block the way of the fierce enemy troops. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/xWctTRMmRc2MxiLpdWwLNYWZpCV4uwzyTRNSw53W.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;763&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/xWctTRMmRc2MxiLpdWwLNYWZpCV4uwzyTRNSw53W.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254966&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A pedestrian rope bridge over the Hunza River&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong >;Kashmir&#39;s &quot;Great Game&quot;: Smoke and dust flying to the west of Jinshan Mountain&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Before Gao Xianzhi rushed to the rope bridge, the prospect of the expeditionary force he commanded was not good: facing a surrendering enemy The fortified city, as well as a large number of enemy reinforcements coming all the way, while our own army has been on the march for more than three months, traveled more than 1,500 kilometers, and faced the extremely harsh geological and climatic conditions in Congling (&lt;em>; After continuous fighting in the wind and snow, the lone expeditionary force advanced deeply into the enemy&#39;s territory. They did not understand the language, had no siege equipment, lacked logistical supplies, and could not get reinforcements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such a difficult situation may have been encountered by Alexander the Great during his legendary expedition to Asia and Europe. However, Alexander stationed his troops to the west of Congling and never crossed over. Gao Xianzhi&#39;s mission was precisely to cross the Congling to regain the lost territory. What&#39;s more, his military strength, animal power and material resources were far less than Alexander&#39;s expeditionary force. This may be why Gao Xianzhi later He was called the &quot;King of the Mountains&quot; by one of his rivals, Sahib jibal al-Sin. Sahib is the Turkic word for &quot;master&quot; , jibal is &quot;mountain&quot; in Arabic, and al-Sin is of China)&lt;/span>; reason. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gao Xianzhi is a descendant of the Goguryeo royal family. His ancestors were the Fuyu people who emerged in the Hunjiang River Basin and the middle reaches of the Yalu River in Northeast China. &quot;Gao was their surname&quot; and established the Goguryeo regime during the Western Han Dynasty, which lasted seven hundred years. For a long time, it once occupied Liaodong to the southwest, and then crossed the Yalu River to the southeast and entered the Korean Peninsula. After the Goguryeo regime perished under the military attacks of the Sui and Tang dynasties, the Tang Dynasty moved the defeated Gao royal family to the Central Plains and Longyou. Gao Xianzhi followed his father Gao Sheji into the army and became a border guard in the Tang Dynasty. He grew up in the Hexi Corridor. He grew up in a military camp, and when he was a boy, he was transferred to the Anxi Protectorate with his father, which is today&#39;s southern Xinjiang, Pamir Plateau and Central Asia Hezhong region. He rose to prominence in his twenties and was promoted to general, the same level as his father. Later, he was further recognized by the leader of the Qiang people and the governor of Anxi, Meng Lingjin, and was promoted to deputy governor of Anxi and commander of the four towns. The horse envoy is equivalent to Fumeng Lingjin&#39;s deputy and the military chief of the entire southern Xinjiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the sixth year of Tianbao&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (747 AD)&lt;/span>;, Gao Xianzhi received an edict from Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty, appointing him In order to serve as a military envoy, I made my fourth expedition to Congling after the failure of my three predecessors to recapture Xiaobolu - the Pakistani-controlled Kashmir where I rode to. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/fKtCWOawnzDSfDbU6a8InBuv60cCYamb90OjqJHx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;579&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/fKtCWOawnzDSfDbU6a8InBuv60cCYamb90OjqJHx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254967&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Cycling in Hunza, Pakistan&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today&#39;s Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (Gilgit-Baltistan) is divided into two parts, Gilgit and Baltistan. The origin of the division can be traced back to the Greater and Lesser Bulu. The original name of this place was Boloristan, which means &quot;mountain country&quot;, where &quot;stan&quot; means &quot;country&quot; in Turkic language. Today, there are five &quot;stan&quot; countries in Central Asia, including Kazakhstan, and Pakistan in South Asia; Bolor means plateau and mountainous area - this place name is famous in the Western Regions of the Tang Dynasty and is translated as &quot;Bolu&quot;. It is the junction area of ​​the four kingdoms of Tang, Tubo, Tianzhu and Dashi, and is divided into the western and western regions. Xiao Bolu in the Sa Valley and Big Bolu in the upper reaches of the Indus River in the east - the goal of Gao Xianzhi&#39;s expedition was Xiao Bolu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Big and Little Bolu were originally one country, and their territory included most of today&#39;s Pakistan-controlled Kashmir and the northern part of Indian-controlled Kashmir. It was a must-win place for Tubo in its Western Region strategy. At the beginning of the seventh century, Tubo annexed the ancient Shangshung Kingdom in the Ali region and unified the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. From then on, it began to implement its Western Region strategy based on the Ali region, and launched a nearly two-year-long war with the Tang Dynasty around Bolu, that is, the Kashmir region. The &quot;Great Game&quot; between Tang and Tibet for centuries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/BPoP6sb1xhgMaISzFXsrbGNTYIjafKo87zl8Qs4z.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/BPoP6sb1xhgMaISzFXsrbGNTYIjafKo87zl8Qs4z.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254969&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hunza Valley&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tubo is backed by the Himalayas. It borders the Tang Dynasty in three directions: north, east and south. Why do we have to choose Kashmir to decide the outcome? Tubo initially launched the main attack on Datang on the Hehuang and Jiannan fronts, but failed to open up the situation. After occupying the Ngari region, Tibet tried to seize southern Xinjiang via the northern Qiangtang Prairie and across the Altyn Mountains. After being blocked again, they had to turn to expand northwest along the Shiquan River/Indus River Basin, intending to bypass the Himalayas and enter through the Ladakh region. Kashmir eventually joined forces with the Western Turks in the north to deal with the Tang Dynasty. In short, Tubo was like a lion trapped on a high platform. It was attacked head-on by the Tang army in Qinghai, Sichuan, Yunnan and Xinjiang. It was unable to get down to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. In the end, it had to choose to go down the mountain from Kashmir, where there was no Tang army, and take a detour. Congling attacked the western border of Tang Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Belu Kingdom, located on this expansion route, became a &quot;soft persimmon&quot; that Tibet fought against with all its strength, and soon split into two countries: the Belu Homeland became a Tubo vassal state, known as &quot; The Great Burud&quot; was roughly located in today&#39;s Baltistan area; another royal family moved westward to the Hunza Valley and established the &quot;Little Burud&quot;, which was roughly located in today&#39;s Gilgit area, relying on the Hunza River and Gilgit The Te River&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(called Suyi River in ancient times)&lt;/span>; and the Indus River line up with deep valleys and natural chasms to resist the Tibetan invasion. King Xiao Bolu did not hesitate to send an envoy to ask for help from the Tang Dynasty, saying that Bolu was the gateway to the Western Regions of the Tang Dynasty. If it fell, all the countries in the Western Regions would fall to Tubo, and the Western Regions would no longer be controlled by the Tang Dynasty&lt;span style =&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Bo Lu, Ximen of the Tang Dynasty. If he loses it, all the Western countries will fall to Tubo)&lt;/span>;, and was finally canonized by Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty and became the Tang Dynasty Subject to the country. In the tenth year of Kaiyuan (722 AD), the Beiting Protectorate of the Tang Army sent 4,000 cavalry reinforcements to Xiaobolu to attack Xiaobolu. He repelled the attack of the Tibetan army and won nearly twenty years of peace for Xiaobolu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 740 AD, Tubo instigated the Tuqishi Khanate in the northern grasslands to rebel against the Tang Dynasty through marriage, and contained the main force of the Tang army in the Western Regions in the northern Xinjiang. On this occasion, he proposed to Xiao Bolu to &quot;borrow a road&quot; and build a rope bridge on the Suyi River. The Tubo army, which successfully crossed the natural barrier of the Suyi River, immediately turned against the foreigners and occupied Xiaobolu. King Su Feng of Xiaobolu was forced to marry the Tibetan princess, and together with more than 20 surrounding small countries, they rebelled against Tang and surrendered to Tibet. The Tibetan army was able to occupy the entire Bolu and get a glimpse of Congling: they captured Lianyun Fort, the fortress of the Tang army guarding the Wakhan Valley, the main road to Congling, opening the way to the north to Central Asia to make friends with the Turks, and cutting off the capital of Anxi. The road from Hufu to the Zhaowu Kingdoms in the Hezhong region also formed a condescending military advantage over the four Anxi towns of the Tang Dynasty located in the Tarim Basin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the unfavorable situation that a gap was opened in the defense line of the Western Region, the Anxi Protectorate had to concentrate all its efforts in order to regain Bolu and block the &quot;downhill&quot; channel of Tubo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/bZT8JG7NjiRBsR7Doyj7Jnnki6xEICEQfr28g9Y1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/bZT8JG7NjiRBsR7Doyj7Jnnki6xEICEQfr28g9Y1.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254970&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The barren and pure river valley in Hunza region&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt; strong>;Recovering the Wakhan Valley: The captives should be frightened after hearing this&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, the most convenient way to go from China&#39;s Pamir Plateau to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir is to go south along the Hunza Valley, or That is to say, follow the Karakoram Highway, which was historically one of the important passages along the southern route of the Silk Road to South Asia. It’s just that in ancient times, caravans used to go through the Mingtie Gaidaban, and when China and Pakistan planned and built the Karakoram Highway in the 1960s, in order to avoid the military threat of the Soviet Union—Tajikistan, which today occupies most of the Pamir Plateau, was Afghanistan, a republic of the Soviet Union, was also under Soviet hostage at the time. The Soviet army deployed an army division in the Wakhan Valley and built missile launch sites and airports. It was eyeing my country&#39;s southern Xinjiang - so it chose the east of Mingtie Gaida Ban. , far away from the Sino-Soviet border and the Khunjerab Pass with complex mountains to achieve better strategic concealment. The cost is that the China-Pakistan Highway on the Pakistani side has a large gap and is easily damaged by natural disasters such as landslides and mudslides. For example, in 2010, a landslide formed a barrier lake, causing the China-Pakistan Highway to be interrupted for five years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Gao Xianzhi went on an expedition to Xiaobolu, he neither took the Mingtiegaida Ban nor the Hongqilafu Pass, because this line of mountainous terrain was already controlled by the Tibetan army at that time. If he took these passes, it would be difficult. Faced with the huge risk of being attacked from the front and rear by the Tibetan army stationed in Lianyunbao, cutting off the food route. Therefore, what he chose was to first pull out Lianyunbao, the nail that was driven into the Congling Mountains, and then go south through the Yasin Valley parallel to it on the west side of the Hunza Valley, and attack Xiaobolu in a roundabout way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lianyun Fort in the Tang Dynasty was located in Sarhad, the last village in eastern Afghanistan today. It guarded the east entrance of the Wakhan Valley, and continued eastward into the Sino-Afghan border area. desert areas. The Wakhan Valley, also known as the Penchi Valley or the Wakhan Corridor, is a valley between the Pamir Plateau and the Hindu Kush Mountains. It stretches more than 600 miles from east to west and is an important cultural passage in the history of China and India. An important part of the southern route of the Silk Road. Zhang Qian of the Han Dynasty &quot;emptied out the Western Region&quot; and went through Congling to the Hezhong area to search for the Dayue clan; nearly 120 years before Gao Xianzhi&#39;s expedition to Xiaobolu&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;(629 AD)&lt;/span>;, &quot;Tang Monk&quot; Xuanzang crossed the Wakhan Valley into South Asia after seven days and nights; the two great empires of Britain and Russia in modern times launched the &quot;Great Game&quot; in Central Asia, and finally used this As the dividing line and isolation zone between the north and the south, the valley demarcated the respective spheres of influence of the two countries, thus introducing the name &quot;Wakhan Corridor&quot;, and generously arbitrarily assigned this then Chinese territory to Afghanistan. It became an abrupt appendix at the eastern end of Afghanistan&#39;s territory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tibet defended the Lianyunbao Fortress at the east entrance of the Wakhan Valley, &quot;weaving wood into a city based on mountains and rivers, cuttings and cliffs in the valley&quot;. To the east, you can enter southern Xinjiang along the Taxkorgan Valley, and to the north you can cross The Pamir Plateau enters Central Asia. To the west, you can bypass the Hindu Kush Mountains and enter South Asia, or you can go to the Transoxiana region along the Pench River. To the south, you can rely on the Hindu Kush Mountains to protect the newly occupied Big and Little Burrows. It can be said that it is connected in all directions. , strategic location. In order to fight steadily, Gao Xianzhi must first clear out the Tubo advance position, and then go south to regain Xiaobolu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was unable to go to the Wakhan Valley to visit Lianyunbao in person, so I had to first take the China-Pakistan Highway to reach the small Buludu city of Gilgit - today&#39;s capital of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (Gilgit), and then walk along the Gao Xianzhi&#39;s march route went in the opposite direction, first going westward along the Gilgit River, then northward along its tributary Yasin Valley, and reaching the southern slope of the Hindu Kush Mountains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/ItRbcoHPJdl4kV2Y35bCnG8BbEqBsEmisEeqIQWS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/ItRbcoHPJdl4kV2Y35bCnG8BbEqBsEmisEeqIQWS.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254968&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tashkorgan Stone City&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the old and new Tang books According to records, Gao Xianzhi commanded 10,000 infantry - equivalent to half of the mobile troops of the Anxi Protectorate - from Qiuci in the fourth lunar month of 747 AD >; (Today&#39;s Kuqa)&lt;/span>; Set out and spent more than a month along the southern foot of Tianshan Mountains via Diazhuangcheng &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(today&#39;s Aksu)&lt;/ span>;, hold Sede&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(today&#39;s Bachu)&lt;/span>; and go west to Shule&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Today&#39;s Kashgar)&lt;/span>;, and mobilized some border guard cavalry along the way, and then followed the Taxkorgan River Valley southward to Congling to guard the capture&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;(&quot;Shouchu&quot; is a small military town in the Tang Dynasty)&lt;/span>;, which is the stone city outside Taxkorgan County today - &quot;Tash&quot; means &quot;stone&quot; in Turkic language. In the first ten days of the seventh lunar month, the Tang army, together with about 20,000 vassal troops from the Western Regions, crossed the Congling Mountains and arrived at Telemanchuan&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (now Khorog, Tajikistan )&lt;/span>;. Gao Xianzhi divided his troops into three groups here. He led the main force of the Tang army back to the west side of Lianyun Fort. He also sent two groups of troops from Kashgar and Aksu to surround Lianyunguo from the north and east respectively. It was agreed on the 13th day of the seventh lunar month. A surprise attack was launched at the same time at day and night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historical records show that the Tubo army held on to the mountain and rolled logs and stones to &quot;cover the sky&quot;, making it difficult for the Tang army to succeed. Gao Xianzhi issued a strict order to his brave generals Li Siye and Tian Zhen: &quot;If we don&#39;t reach the sun, we must break the enemy!&quot;. The &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot; once wrote a biography of Li Siye, saying that he was born in the military and was &quot;seven feet long and extremely brave.&quot; Facing the intensive defense of the defenders, he and Tian Zhen held the double-edged Mo Dao and led a troop of Mo Dao soldiers. The commando team found another way and &quot;climbed first at the most dangerous place&quot;, that is, climbed up from the cliff that the Tubo defenders did not expect, and rushed into the enemy&#39;s stronghold from a high position. As expected, they captured the building before noon, which was garrisoned by more than 10,000 Tubo troops. , a fortress with a compound defense system composed of mountain fortresses and mountain foot camps, beheaded 5,000 people, captured more than 1,000 people, and won the largest tough battle of the expedition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Tang army recaptured Lianyun Fort, drove the Tubo out of Congling, and regained the Wakhan Valley, the passage connecting the Western Regions. The next step was to cross the Hindu Kush Mountains, recapture Xiaobolu, and clear out the The threat of the Tibetan army to the Wakhan Valley. It was mid-August at that time. Today&#39;s Wakhan Corridor is only passable from June to August of the year. The mountains are blocked by heavy snow at other times. The climate in the Tang Dynasty was also the same. Presumably considering the weather factors, Gao Xianzhi did not delay at Lianyun Fort, leaving more than 3,000 weak soldiers behind. He led his elite infantry to march lightly and quickly, and ran for three days and nights, arriving at Darkut Pass (Darkut Pass, &lt;span style =&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Today&#39;s translation is Dakot Pass). &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/8kscrApbrsiJFCskX9KcLqRJ1jVIPF19O4ElMSvA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/8kscrApbrsiJFCskX9KcLqRJ1jVIPF19O4ElMSvA.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254971&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wakhan Corridor, with the Hindu Kush Mountains in the background. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Crossing the Hindu Kush: The vast sea is covered with hundreds of feet of ice&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Pakistan and Afghanistan are bounded by the Hindu Kush Mountains in the Wakhan Corridor. This Persian name was first seen in the narrative of the medieval Arab traveler Ibn Battuta. It is literally translated as &quot;Hindu (Hindu Kush)&quot;. &quot;Hindu&quot; killer (Kush)&quot;, which means that a large number of Indian slaves captured from the hot areas of South Asia froze to death while crossing this high and cold mountain; some people also interpret it as the &quot;Mountain of India&quot;, which means crossing southward This mountain range enters the Indian subcontinent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Tanjuling Pass is located in the eastern section of the Hindu Kush Mountains, but it is not a pass that runs through this mountain range - because there are two watersheds and two mountain passes here. The eastern end of the Hindu Kush Mountains originates from the Pamir Plateau and has the characteristics of mountain twists and turns. It is divided into parallel north and south branches near the Tanju Ridge: the north branch is the border line between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and south of the south branch is the north and south branches. The Yasin River Valley runs east-west, while the Yarkhun River runs east-west between the north and south branches. Tanjuling Pass is a pass on the South Branch, with an altitude of 4688 meters. There are glaciers on both sides of the pass, making it difficult to cross. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So is there any other way? In fact, there is. After crossing the northern branch of the Hindu Kush Mountains, you can go west along the Yakun Valley, bypass the southern branch, and then cross the famous Shandur Pass (Shandur) eastward into the Gilgit Valley, and then you can go down the river to Xiaobo. law. However, this route is still extremely rugged and difficult to travel today in the 21st century. There are no paved roads in the Yaquin Valley. Most of the road sections are simple gravel roads located on steep cliffs and halfway up the mountain, and can only accommodate one vehicle passing through at low speeds. I was going to get a flat tire every minute, so I had to store my bike and hire a motorcyclist to take me into the Yaquin Valley. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/An6dIyETx5jIvnAWAGpM9XcSmAmAeJBj4xm0BGXR.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/An6dIyETx5jIvnAWAGpM9XcSmAmAeJBj4xm0BGXR.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254972&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Shandur Pass is the birthplace of polo. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is conceivable that the road conditions here 1,300 years ago would have been much worse than now. If Gao Xianzhi led his troops to go around the Yakun Valley, it would probably take an extra month to go. It would be mid-to-late September. The Tibetan reinforcements were already waiting in Xiaobolu Yiyi, and the Hindu Kush Mountains and the Pamir Plateau would soon be It will be impassable due to the severe cold, which means that the Tang army&#39;s return route will be cut off - I guess this is why Gao Xianzhi decided to race against time and led his army to risk crossing the Tanjuling Pass &quot;straight down for more than forty miles.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the soldiers who serve as soldiers and eat food do not have such strategic insight. After finally climbing up the ice and snow to Tanju Ridge, they looked at the rolling glaciers at their feet and asked Gao Xianzhi in panic: &quot;Where does the ambassador want me to go?&quot; - &quot;Ambassador&quot; is the honorific title given to Jiedushi in the Tang Dynasty - —Do you want us to slide down from the top of such a steep glacier? Are you taking us to Little Bolu or Yama Hall? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thousands of years ago, Stein, a British-Hungarian explorer, wrote after an on-site inspection of Gao Xianzhi’s march route: &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When I stood From the shimmering snow at the top of the mountain pass, peering down to the steep slopes that lead to the end of the Yasin Valley at 6,000 feet, we can understand why the Tang army refused to move forward at first, how difficult it was for them to struggle forward later, and how brave Gao Xianzhi was. clear! &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/QmEoteO6T3NeHWtoJELvU9xOW5FmFYpLIBb5Wihg.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1200&quot; height=&quot;668&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/QmEoteO6T3NeHWtoJELvU9xOW5FmFYpLIBb5Wihg.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254973&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tanjuling&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, Gao Xianzhi Soldiers cannot be driven by personal bravery. He anticipated the weakness of human nature and knew that soldiers did not dare to climb the ice and go deep into the enemy&#39;s territory, so he quietly sent more than 20 of his trusted aides, dressed in Berrut clothing, to climb up Tanju Ridge in advance to wait for the large army. While the soldiers of the Tang Dynasty were wondering on the top of the mountain, these impostors came forward with smiles, claiming to be the defenders of Xiaobolu stationed opposite the mountain pass. They came to surrender to the king on behalf of the defenders of Anuyue City. Bo Lu has cut off the only way for Tibetan reinforcements to pass. This great (&lt;em>;false&lt;/em>;) news made the soldiers of the Tang Dynasty suddenly feel that victory was in sight, so they obeyed the general&#39;s order with confidence and crossed Tanju Ridge and entered the Yasin Valley. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to historians’ research, Anuyue City is located in today’s Gupis Town, where the Yasin River merges into the Gilgit River. The biggest pass on the way to the capital. I cycled along the paved road from Gilgit to Chitral. When a primary school on the roadside was getting out of school, three to five hundred girls wearing black hijabs happily poured out of the school gate&lt;span style=&quot; font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(local boys and girls each attend half-day school)&lt;/span>;, which temporarily blocked the road. After they dispersed into the streets, I saw the chain bridge built with Chinese aid on the north side of the highway across the fast-flowing Gilgit River. After crossing the bridge and going up the river a short distance away, I could see a clear tributary flowing from the northwest. Entering the big river, it is the Yasin River, which is formed by melting snow from Tanjuling Glacier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/a3WXffZ5FQu5EWQchTj2pAmrlpm6JAxX4OpDzaI8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/a3WXffZ5FQu5EWQchTj2pAmrlpm6JAxX4OpDzaI8.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254974&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The Yasin Valley under Tanju Ridge&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Conga The total distance from Nuyue City to the southern foot of Tanju Ridge at the source of the Yasin River is nearly 70 kilometers. It is also an unpaved simple dirt road. It took me three hours to arrive by car. Gao Xianzhi led his army over the mountains and ridges. Four days. When there was only one day left on the mountain road, good news came: Anuyue City had really sent an envoy to greet the Tang army. Perhaps the guard knew that the main force of the Tibetan army had been gathered and annihilated in Lianyun Fort, and the Tang army had crossed the dangerous Tanju Ridge. The Suyi River could no longer stop its troops, so they decided to surrender to the Tang Army in Kaicheng. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But what came to my mind was another scene: the Tang army soldiers looked at the two groups of Hu people in surprise. They both claimed to be the defenders of Anuyue City, and both claimed to be surrendering, but each other I don’t know each other, and I can’t communicate with them. The latter group had a Persian look, with their high noses and deep eyes, but the former group looked similar to me. They spoke in a nonsensical way and looked at each other awkwardly...&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Cut the Indus Valley: Ximen, the charioteer, stands to show off his victory&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Starting from Anuyue City, go east along the Suyi River to Niduo, the capital city of Xiaobolu, the distance is about One hundred and ten kilometers. Niduo City is located at the intersection of the Hunza Valley and the Sui River Valley. The original site of the city is unknown, but according to historical records, it should be located on the west bank of the Sui River. Today it is Gilgit, the capital of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and is named after the river. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About sixty miles further down the Sui River from Niduo City is the mouth of the Sui River where it merges into the Indus River. From there, going down the Indus River is what was known in ancient times as the &quot;Land of Five Rivers&quot;. &quot;Punjab Plain&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(&quot;Punjab&quot; means &quot;Five Rivers&quot; in Hindi)&lt;/span>; - the five rivers originate from the Himalayas The tributaries at the southern foot of the mountain range merge into the Indus River one after another, forming a fertile alluvial plain that gave birth to ancient Indian civilization. From here, you can go upstream and pass through the spectacular grand canyon from the river mouth to Skardu. You can enter Dabolu and finally cross the Himalayas to reach the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Karakoram Highway goes south along the platform on the right side of the Hunza River, Gilgit River and Indus River, taking a beautiful U-shaped bend near the mouth of the Gilgit River and descending to the shore. Then cross the Gilgit River through a road bridge, and on the other side is Highway S1, which leads along the Indus River to the India-Pakistan confrontation area in Kashmir. Its strategic value is very important. During Gao Xianzhi&#39;s expedition, a rope bridge made of rattan was built where the highway bridge is now. It was built by Tibet by tricking Xiao Bolu into &quot;borrowing the road&quot;. It is &quot;one arrow wide&quot;, which means that the span of the vine bridge reaches the archery range of the time - about two hundred meters. This vine bridge is the only way for the Tibetan army to pass from Dabolu to Xiaobolu and even north to Congling. It can be said to be the key to the throat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But it was said that Gao Xianzhi led his army to Niduo City, and the Xiaobolu nobles who were loyal to Tibet held on to the capital and refused to let the Tang army enter the city. Gao Xianzhi fell into the dilemma described at the beginning of this article: if Niduo City is not captured as soon as possible, once the Tibetan reinforcements arrive, the Tang army, which has lost its retreat, will inevitably fall into a pincer attack from both sides and be surrounded and annihilated under Niduo City in the coming severe winter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Gao Xianzhi did not assume the posture of attacking the city - of course, he did not have the manpower and material resources to storm the fortified city. The top commander of the expeditionary force first sent an envoy to stabilize King Xiaobolu, claiming that the Tang army neither planned to attack the city nor destroy the Tengqiao, but intended to pass through the Tengqiao to attack the Tibetan army of Dabolu; secondly, he used The gold and silver property lured the pro-Tibet nobles who guarded the city, and tricked them into the Tang camp and beheaded them all; and the most important task, Gao Xianzhi handed over to the pioneer Xi Yuanqing: rush to the mouth of the Suyi River to destroy the Tengqiao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The road from Niduo City to the mouth of the Suyi River was a military road laid by the Tibetan army. The road condition must be good, but by the time Xi Yuanqing marched sixty miles to Tengqiao, the sun had already set on the snow peak on the west side of the canyon. behind. In the deep dusk, he saw a flock of birds flying in the mountains opposite, and smoke and dust rising up - that was another army coming at full speed. Xi Yuanqing didn&#39;t waste any time and immediately ordered his soldiers to cut off the cane together. As soon as Tengqiao fell into the extremely fast Suyi River, which the ancients called weak water, a large group of Tibetan reinforcements rushed to the other side. Unfortunately, it was too late to cross the river. GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(&quot;Old Book of Tang&quot;: It was late in the evening, and it was just cut. The Tubo soldiers and horses arrived, and it was no longer possible). &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/PnJOz5W8HdgAwZ8xG3Di00h5CaRC2mXr2W1STqHx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/PnJOz5W8HdgAwZ8xG3Di00h5CaRC2mXr2W1STqHx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254976&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The fast-flowing Suyi River is also called weak water. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This vine bridge took a year to build. Now the Tang army controls the west bank, and Tubo The army could not rebuild the vine bridge, and it was impossible to cross the river on foot. They had no choice but to look at the river and sigh, then returned to Dabolu dejectedly. The Tubo side&#39;s &quot;Dunhuang Tubo Documents·Chronicle of Major Events&quot; records this under the entry of the Year of the Pig in the Tibetan Calendar: Bolu Kingdom, Kodi )&lt;/span>;The defenders were defeated by the Tang people and the defenders fell. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this point, the Tubo defenders were annihilated, the Tubo reinforcements were blocked, and the pro-Tubo faction was killed. The defeat of Xiaobolu King Su suddenly became the party that was besieged on all sides and had to surrender to Gao Xianzhi. The king and his Tibetan queen were sent to Chang&#39;an as prisoners, while Xiao Bolu was renamed the Quy Nhon Army and guarded here by a thousand Tang troops. The entire battle to recapture Xiaobolu lasted four months, but the actual combat process lasted only more than ten days. Except for the half-day bloody battle at Lianyun Castle, it could be said that the victory was achieved without any bloodshed in Xiaobolu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Stein once commented: &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;A large number of armies passed through the Pamirs and Hindu Kush. Make this your first time. The mountains were high and there was a lack of supplies. I wonder how to maintain the supply of the army at that time? Even the modern general staff headquarters would be helpless... This brave Chinese general marched through more dangerous and difficult terrain. Compared with the famous European generals, from Hannibal to Napoleon to Suvorov, they crossed the Alps. , I really don’t know how many times more than that. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/TNvnijQcmMWhhIKM3mlemCmHXMeL1ssu3i3zKftF.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/TNvnijQcmMWhhIKM3mlemCmHXMeL1ssu3i3zKftF.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254975&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Ultar Glacier and Baltit Castle in the Hunza Valley&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Epilogue: A place for horse riding in the sky above the snow&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Ten Years of Tianbao&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (AD 751), Gao Xianzhi was transferred from the Anxi Protectorate. Two years later, the new Anxi Jiedushi Feng Changqing, the successor he single-handedly promoted from Cao Mang, sent troops to recapture Dabolu, thereby completely cutting off the Tibetan invasion of the four towns of Anxi via Bolu and Congling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this battle was the last expansion of the Tang Dynasty in the Western Regions. Only two years later, the Anshi Rebellion broke out, and the Central Plains fell into raging war. The Tang Dynasty, which was on the verge of extinction, was no longer able to manage the Western Regions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this time, Tubo also changed its strategy against the Tang Dynasty. When faced with the strong troops of the Tang Dynasty, it detoured to Bolu to attack one of its four towns in Anxi. Instead, it used the Tang Dynasty to repeatedly mobilize Hexi elites to quell rebellions in the interior, which led to local rebellions. With the opportunity of empty troops, they resumed their main attack on the Hehuang area, seizing the Hexi Corridor connecting the Western Regions of the Tang Dynasty and the Central Plains, and then defeated the towns and countries in the Western Regions that had lost contact and were isolated. The ruling system of the Western Regions of the Tang Dynasty collapsed. By the beginning of the ninth century, the Anxi Protectorate had completely fallen, and the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains were not re-incorporated into the territory of my country until the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty. Therefore, it was called &quot;Xinjiang&quot;, which means &quot;new return to the homeland&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for why Gao Xianzhi was transferred out of the Western Regions at the height of his military power, that is another story of ups and downs. &lt;p>; The two moved to the Western Regions and traveled all over the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains.)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https: //feedx.net&quot;

&lt;p>;浙江省老年服务业协会会长徐佳增认为，农村养老服务重点应放在失能失智人群社会服务供给上。要加强低收入群体救助帮扶，加快建立长期护理保险制度，发挥乡镇卫生院、乡村医生的网络优势，鼓励乡村医生为高龄、重病、失能等老年群体提供定期体检、上门巡诊、家庭病床等基本服务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;北京市民政局副局长郭汉桥建议，鼓励社会资本进入养老产业，培育多元经营主体，共同做大做强养老服务产业。目前，北京已探索搭建养老服务统一信息平台，畅通资源对接、供需匹配，支持和引导经营主体积极参与养老服务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;针对养老护理人才短缺等问题，浙江省绍兴市上虞区民政局局长丁福军建议，提高护理人员待遇，提升大众对护理人员认可度。同时，引导广大社会公益组织、慈善机构、青年志愿者参与养老服务工作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，要大力推进智能设备的应用和数字化管理，赋能养老服务。目前一些地方已在开展这方面的探索，如杭州市开展安居守护工程，对适老化改造对象按需安装烟雾报警器、紧急呼叫器等智能监测设备；长沙市有针对性地开展适老化改造，为部分老人配备“防走失”科技服、睡眠检测仪等智能设备，并实时将健康数据同步到云端。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“围堵政策”下的国际格局&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;1949年，国民党败退台湾。这一段时期，美国曾有深入的检讨，也确定其国策所在：如何防堵苏联和中国联合战线？所谓“自由世界”，也就是英美领导的欧洲和美国，该如何面对社会主义阵容？主张资本主义自由经济的国家，与奉行社会主义计划经济的国家，二者之间是和平相处，还是处处对抗？这是当时美国政府非常挂心的事情。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1947年，杜鲁门总统就以上问题征求马歇尔、艾森豪威尔和麦克阿瑟的意见后，采纳围堵政策。 1946年2月22日，驻守莫斯科的美国大使馆代办凯南（George F. Kennan），向国务院发送了著名的“长电报”。凯南的建议，定下了美国对战后世界的规划：“围堵政策”（Strategy of Containment）。从杜鲁门时代一直延伸到尼克松时代，都在这个方向做种种的外交措施。而在尼克松时代，基辛格规划了“联系”（Engagement）政策。但是，从整体原则而言，“联系”也只是手段，是想在“围堵”之中，设法闯出一个缺口。所以，“围堵政策”可以说是几十年来，美国处理世界事务的最高原则。直到最近，这一政策演化成手忙脚乱的局面，这是当时没有预料到的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;回顾1947年至今，七十多年来，西方世界大多是在这个“围堵政策”的统治下：美国自我期许，应该担起“自由世界”“自由经济”的“防卫者”这个责任。所有可能出现的“缺口”，都要尽量堵上——从北海延伸到鄂霍茨克海，从柏林延伸到库页岛。这一条漫长的战线，中间以苏联为主，而中国作为没有指明的“伙伴”——中国的“伙伴”身份，究竟是靠向哪一边，这个电文里没有叙述。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;关于这一政策的落实，美国决定以前述三个重要人物作为主要执行者。第一步是马歇尔以国务卿的身份，主持旨在推动欧洲复兴的“马歇尔计划”（官方名称为“欧洲复兴计划”European Recovery Program），同时以美元援助希腊、土耳其——这两个国家，是苏联舰队由里海、黑海进入地中海的要道。在东方，日本投降以后，麦克阿瑟要将日本与韩国打造为“东方的民主堡垒”，亲自主持东线的防守。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杜鲁门退任以后，接任的是艾森豪威尔，三者维持了这个局面几十年。其中的插曲是杜鲁门无法忍受麦克阿瑟“将在外不受君命”，从南韩召回这一悍将。但是，马歇尔与艾森豪威尔忠诚地执行了这一政策。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这个政策在东方的第一步，是美国第七舰队开始巡防台湾海峡，使得孤悬在中国大陆海边的金门、马祖——这两个国民党台湾当局仅存的基地得以保全。青岛本来是美军驻华的海军基地，美国人却在真正卷入中国本土战场前撤离了。否则，驻守青岛的美军，将会与驻韩美军形成呼应。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这个决定，引发一连串东亚的变局。美国强化菲律宾的基地，将日本和琉球作为美国东方防线的重要据点，加上台湾，构成围堵中国大陆的“第一岛链”。这个政策维持之长久、执行之着力、影响之深远一直到今天。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从那时开始，美国拒绝与中国大陆来往。即使1971年，“中华民国”已经被迫退出联合国，美国与其之间的关系还是维持到1978年，直到北京与华府正式建交为止。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;冷战开始后，防守台湾成为美国的任务之一。对于台湾当局而论，假如没有美国这颗“定心丸”——美国将防线划在台湾海峡——的话，台湾这个基地的建设不可能展开。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;台湾和海峡另一边本土之间的恩恩怨怨，到今天还无法解除。将来怎么解决这些纠纷？如何才能“破镜重圆”？如何能让台湾建设的成果、台湾的人才、台湾的经济基础，与大陆的经济建设可以互相支持？这要靠我们华人的智慧，思考如何能够顾及中华血脉。当然，关于“中华血脉”这四字，民进党与我的想法不一样。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实上，两岸在经济建设方面曾经互相支持，从1970年代至今没有停止。大陆的经济建设，比台湾晚了大约二十年，因为中间经历了三十年尝试种种政策导致的颠簸。从邓小平主政时期开始，到今天双方的合作和沟通，由两边的海峡事务委员会当“桥梁”，由外国的元首如李光耀等作为“中间人”。港澳还未回归以前，是两岸很自然的接触点。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第二个非常重要的事情，就是蒋经国开启的台湾体制改革。他宣告：“我们蒋家人不再介入政治。”后来，李登辉改变了台湾的基本大法。但吊诡的是，美国政府继续承诺“要以全力保卫台湾”，这个说法成为国际关系史上前所罕见的一个例子。熟悉国际事务的人士，曾经用“有心的模糊”形容如此安排。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在中国历史上，从春秋转入战国的时代，晋国曾是“五霸”里实质上的领袖。晋国占有其盟国卫国的干邑。晋国的霸权在那时也已日薄西山，内部终为韩、赵、魏三家瓜分，中国历史进入战国的“七雄”时代。那时真正有实力竞争霸主的，是秦、楚两个边缘的大国——夹缝里出现的吴、越两个霸主，都只是昙花一现。秦、楚这两个边缘大国竞争，最终秦国统一了神州大陆，成为“中华帝国”的前身。而秦国统一中原的过程及其所建立的制度，实际上约束了中华帝国两千年的形式，到1911年方才改变。在此，我以中国历史上的这个例子，来预见美国几十年来的霸权日后可能的变化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美国的霸权建立至今，东亚遭遇了诸多危机：一次朝鲜战争、两次越南战争——日本和韩国则沦为美国实际上的“属地”，冲绳的地位变得不明不白。而这些，都是“围堵政策”的后果。美国如此称霸，它在别国之内可以像晋国取得卫国的干邑一样——干邑在当时中原的东半边是个据点，晋国在北半边指挥不动。这个情势，就很像东亚“岛链”情形。吊诡的是，晋国分出来的赵国最后将干邑夺走了。将来美国会不会将台湾转变成日本、韩国的“延伸”，我们无法预测。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;再看欧洲的局面。 “马歇尔计划”以后，美国以组建北约、欧盟的方式，以英、法、德三国——过去的敌人德国作为重点，扼守在欧洲中心地带。数十年过来，如今欧盟已经感觉到：当年的美国是为了保护他们，如今的美国却成为他们的主人。美国为了保卫欧洲，花费了极大力气。 “马歇尔计划”真是从断壁残垣之中，重新建立了一个花团锦簇的世界。如今的德国，其繁荣的经济基础，与今天我们看到的美国不一样——英、法败下阵来了，德国上来了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美国在战后，将德国一分为二：一半由西方占领，一半由苏联占领——如同朝鲜与南韩、南越和北越的划分一样。柏林是独立市，又在中间建了一道“柏林墙”。 1948年第一次柏林危机，苏联封锁柏林，美国长达数月空投粮食、汉堡、热狗、牛奶、鸡蛋乃至纸张等生活物资，飞机在跑道上没有停过。那一笔开支相当惊人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1963年6月25日，肯尼迪在柏林讲演——“作为一个自由人，我无比自豪地说：我是一个柏林人。”肯尼迪担任总统以后，还曾经讲过：我们不要忘记丘吉尔与我们的老总统罗斯福曾经提出，人类应当有“四大自由”。 （罗斯福与丘吉尔签订的《大西洋宪章》其实有两个“版本”：一个是长的“条约”，一个是短的“四大自由”的口号——免于恐惧的自由，免于匮乏的自由，言论自由，信仰自由。）我们责无旁贷，要做世界的卫兵，维护这“四大自由”。当年的肯尼迪，就以“四大自由”为理由宣誓：我们的任务，任重而道远。不要问国家能为我们做什么，要问我们能为国家做什么。当年罗斯福总统实行新政以后，国家对国民尽责任，维持其起码的生活水平——我们政府的责任，就是在美国的领土上实现“四大自由”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些宣示非常动听，而且美国人的实践确实也非常努力。当初所划定的界线，今天还依然存在——最近乌克兰与俄罗斯的冲突，还是因为美国“围堵政策”所导致的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前面我所讲的，是为了说明凯南“围堵政策”的文化背景、美国对自己的期许，以及做出的努力。从那时到现在，七十多年了，美国的霸权都在“围堵政策”的话语体系下呈现。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中间还发生过古巴导弹危机。苏联想要在古巴设立一个导弹基地，美国坚决不允许。肯尼迪和赫鲁晓夫对抗，彼此不相让——最终苏联让步，将部署在古巴的导弹撤回。而美国至今还占着古巴的关塔那摩监狱，死也不肯让出来：这是一个没有法律管束的牢狱，美国在此审问的间谍、俘虏的囚犯，没有任何人权法保护，被施以灌水、鞭打、电击等酷刑，死了就将尸体扔掉。如此行径，我常常用“吊诡”这两个字形容：美国号称要维护“四大自由”，实际上始终存在这样一个“疮疤”，却视若无睹。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1957年，人类第一颗人造卫星由苏联发射成功。美国花钱费力，力图保持太空的均势，终于在1969年的尼克松时代，美国航天员首次登上月球。此前一年，美、苏、英等59个国家，共同签署了《不扩散核武器条约》。限制新的国家发展核武器，这对于世界而言是好事——至于已经拥有核武器的国家，会不会有人首先使用核弹，就是未知之数了。一直到里根时代，美国与苏联的军备竞争始终在进行，甚至发展到可以用卫星将核弹运载到太空——美国以巨量的太空军备竞赛，压垮了苏联的经济。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前面讲述美国历史上的外交政策作为背景，是为了说明：美国的外交政策，是中美关系中最主要的一剂“药”，也是为了维护西方文化的霸权思想、“围堵”思想。这才是我们理解二战以来的世界这个复杂的大棋局，很重要的一个原则。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“麦卡锡主义”下的留美华人&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;二战以来，众多中国留学生在美国深造，包括我在内。我们到这儿来求学，是因为美国学校的课程、设备居全球之冠。这一阶段，美国确实也在大量招收外国学生，我们趁此机会来学本事。当然，中国人喜欢落叶归根。早期通过“庚款”来到美国的成百上千留学生，大多数都回到中国，主要的工作岗位不是在教育界，就是在实业界。那个时期，中国的科技发展还不是主流，科技人才也就大致分配在上面两个范围。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;等到战后，国共内战，中国一分为二，海峡封锁，这就成了大问题：中国大陆出来的留学生，在“围堵政策”的立场之下，美国不让他们回大陆。最重要的一个例子，就是钱学森。当时美国的物理学是世界前哨，假如中国要发展现代科技的武器，钱学森的参与必定有其贡献。我相信钱学森在发明导弹这件事上尽了力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“铁幕”开始降落时，美国开始疑忌在美的“左倾”人士。这一事件发生在杜鲁门任上，“麦卡锡主义”不仅要挡住那些选择回到中国或东欧国家的知识分子，而且要铲除国内的“左倾”分子。所谓“左倾”，其定义就变成“自由分子”——凡是不“右”的，就给他们戴上“左”的帽子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;主要负责此事的，是太平洋国际学会。他们的监视网非常宽广，笼罩在所有中国研究的基地上——匹兹堡还好，因为不是大基地。如此情况，使得全美的华人都心惊胆战，不知道哪天联邦调查局或中央情报局的探员，会查阅你的来往信件，会检查你的纳税数目。大家杯弓蛇影，心怀恐惧。 1970年我来匹兹堡的时候，还看见了这种现象的遗留。一位姓余的老华侨——到这里他改名换姓为“林盼”，因为他买了林家的“出生纸”；我们家现在的牙医就是余家的。老先生到我的办公室来谈话，进来先把门关好，然后轻轻地和我谈他们的恐惧，低声问我：“这个局面何时可以终了？”因为他们有很多家乡子弟想要出来，但“铁幕”已垂下；还有那些死在异域的几十个同乡，只好先火化，等到有一天带回故乡去。最近犬子还访问了存放骨灰的地点，确实有几十个坛子在那里。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;到后来“麦卡锡主义”平复了，台湾恢复与美国的来往。 1962年我回到台湾，此后两三年间在母校台湾大学历史系服务，按照现代的规模、方向安排课程；余外的工作，就是奉命与美国的学术单位及汉学家联络。我的上司是“中研院”院长王世杰先生，以及史语所所长李济先生。这个工作非常艰难，有很多人质疑我的立场：我们如果到台湾去，会不会加重美国对我本人的猜疑？我说：“我不能回答你的问题，但是我回去了，我没问题啊。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一直到1971年，尼克松与中国大陆开展“乒乓外交”以后，才有大量的华侨青年和留学生回大陆；随后同样有大量的留学生从大陆过来，比从台湾来的多十倍都不止。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/Wcb0MkQeDfGn11pLogqeywCkeBau6ADMYXoj9kSS.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;1956年，杨振宁、李政道二位先生提出“宇称不守恒定律”；随后，吴健雄女士以试验证明了这一理论——这三位都是世界著名的物理学家。杨先生因其父亲还在大陆，中美关系一松动他就回去了，从此没有断绝过与大陆的来往。他也很努力地将美国现代物理学的研究情形引介到国内，帮助国内的学者。数十年来，他本其初衷，帮助了许多学生留学，为大陆物理学的发展尽了自己的力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我曾有幸与他以及刘遵义一起，帮助余纪忠先生在中国大陆设立“华英文教基金会”，目的是帮助大学的教员出国，做短则半年、长则一年的进修。只要他们提出访问单位、目标、计划、时间，以及美国的邀请函或接收的承诺，还有校内给出的推荐信，我们就尽力在专业的方向评定其次序。看见如此多优秀的学者排着队，准备作更进一步的努力，于我而言是件非常愉快的工作。遗憾的是僧多粥少，我们无法满足每个人的愿望。因为这一项工作，杨先生与我们每年碰面一次。除了我们对各校讲演以外，我也有机会向他请教。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后来，我们同时在香港中文大学做访问，经常会一起喝茶聊天。如此交谊，我对他钦佩有加：老而不失童心，聪明而没有凌人之势。他将专门的学问做到了巅峰，而且对一般事务非常了解。最可佩处：对像我这种年纪的后辈，他完全是坦诚相交，使我与他谈话感觉如坐春风。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[再获雨果奖，中国科幻文学更进一步]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259145]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-24 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;10月21日晚，2023雨果奖在2023成都世界科幻大会上揭晓，共评选出17类雨果奖奖项和2类非雨果奖奖项，中国作家海漄凭借《时空画师》获得最佳短中篇小说奖。 This is also the first time that the Hugo Awards are announced and awarded in China.</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 17:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[检察机关依法对李春生涉嫌受贿一案提起公诉]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259201]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-24 16:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Reporters learned from the Supreme People’s Procuratorate on October 24 that the former deputy secretary and deputy director of the Party Leadership Group of the Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial People’s Congress Li Chunsheng&#39;s suspected bribery case was investigated and concluded by the National Supervisory Commission.

They later underwent two historic reforms: shareholding split and registration system. But for a long time, every investor has suffered from short-term bullishness and bearishness. What loopholes have been left behind by the share-trading reform that once inspired the Long Bull market? How to fix blockage? What loopholes have arisen from the registration system? How to fix it quickly? How can the positioning of China&#39;s capital market mature through changes? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the occasion of the 45th anniversary of the reform and opening up of China&#39;s financial industry, Wu Xiaoqiu, former vice president of Renmin University of China and director of the China Capital Market Research Institute, emphasized in an exclusive interview with Southern Weekend that the establishment of the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges and the split of shares Reform and comprehensive registration-based reform are three monuments in the more than 30 years since the establishment of China&#39;s capital market. While they have achieved great success, they have also left some loopholes. These loopholes are the important institutional constraints that have caused the capital market to stagnate over the past decade. At present, regulatory authorities have realized and stepped up efforts to improve system design and plug loopholes. In the longer term, the main function of China&#39;s capital market is to transform from financing enterprises to a wealth management platform for investors, and from a financing market to an investment market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Xiaoqiu is the youngest professor of economics in the history of Renmin University of China and the first doctoral supervisor in the field of securities investment in China. He has been engaged in securities teaching and research for more than 30 years. He led the compilation of the first edition of China Securities Practitioner examination materials. He is also the promoter and witness of many major reforms in the capital market, such as the share-trading reform and the registration system reform. He has made many suggestions for active capital markets. Among them, his consistent assertion that &quot;the time is not ripe for the implementation of the T+0 trading system&quot; is in line with the China Securities Regulatory Commission. The current stance is consistent. The &quot;Phaseically Tightened Securities Lending and Strategic Investors Placement and Lending of Shares&quot; notice issued by the China Securities Regulatory Commission on October 14, 2023 is also related to the loopholes in the shareholding reduction rules and systems that Wu Xiaoqiu has been paying attention to. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/raTGJwAtxKIRGrHUUoBIlw9OS03pZ4c1M2TYy5Y4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;569&quot; height= &quot;854&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/raTGJwAtxKIRGrHUUoBIlw9OS03pZ4c1M2TYy5Y4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255051&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wu Xiaoqiu: former vice president of Renmin University of China; currently dean of the National Institute of Financial Research and China Capital Market Research Institute of Renmin University of China, national first-class professor, and executive director of the China Society for Finance and Banking . &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Engaged in the economy&lt;/strong>;&lt; strong>;,&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Financial and Capital Market Research&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Forty&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Years”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You are a college student in the &quot;New Third Class&quot; (1977-1979).

It is equivalent to a fundamental adjustment of the talent training system during the ten-year &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; period, bringing order to things.

In 1985, the central government issued the &quot;Decision on Economic System Reform&quot; and launched the economic system reform that combined planning and market. It was a historic decision. I was a second-year graduate student at the time, and my supervisor, Mr. Hu Naowu, and I attended this seminar. That was my first time to participate in a national, high-level forum. It touched me greatly and expanded my horizons. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second time was in 1985, when I participated in the Second Youth and Middle-aged Economic Forum held in Tianjin. The young people participating in the forum were active in thinking, participating in various debates, thinking about China&#39;s future, and exploring the focus of reform. I was writing an article about corporate bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is a thing of the market economy. There was no such thing as bankruptcy in China under the planned economy at that time, only &quot;shut down and transfer&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third time in 1985, I participated in a forum held in the Great Hall of the People. That forum was hosted by Mr. Dong Fucheng, and my speech attracted the attention of Li Chengrui, then director of the National Bureau of Statistics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fourth time was in 1986, when I participated in another discussion meeting on economic leverage in Leshan, Sichuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was only in my twenties at the time. It can be seen that that era gave young people many platforms and opportunities to speak freely at high-level forums held in the Great Hall of the People. This activates your mind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Those were sparkling days, full of youthful dreams and pursuits of young people everywhere. Only when the mind is liberated can academics prosper and the country develop. Without emancipating our minds, we cannot find the right path to development. Everything must be explored, discussed and even debated before you know which is the right path. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Cracking the mystery of China&#39;s special economic phenomenon&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics , Italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;During your doctoral studies (1987-1990), the basic line of &quot;one center, two basic points&quot; and &quot;science and technology are the primary productive forces&quot; were proposed. In the meantime, what are your views on China’s economic reform? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The most important thing when studying for a PhD is to learn advanced theories, study the Chinese economy, and how to solve the mystery of the special phenomena of the Chinese economy at that time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The book that had the greatest impact on me at that time was &quot;The Economics of Shortage&quot; by the Hungarian economist János Korny. In the mid-to-late 1980s, many people read this work. &quot;Shortage Economics&quot; is a book that describes the basic characteristics of socialist economic operations under the traditional planned economic system. It is rich in strong theoretical logic, including soft budget constraints, paternalism, etc. Inspired by his thoughts, I started writing &quot;Theory of Compact Movement&quot; in 1987. &quot;The Theory of Tight Operation&quot; and my doctoral thesis &quot;Analysis of Socialist Economic Operation&quot; were published in 1991 and 1992 respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why did this book receive such special attention at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The real value of these two books is their attempt to explain the characteristics and laws of socialist economic operation under the traditional system. Because of these two books, as well as articles and papers published in People&#39;s Daily, Guangming Daily, Economic Research and Journal of Renmin University of China, I was promoted to professor by Renmin University in 1993. That year, Renmin University made an exception and promoted five professors, and I was the youngest among them. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Transforming securities research and taking a road less traveled&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font -family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In 1994, you were transferred to the Department of Finance and Economics as a professor in the field of securities research in finance. The following year, you became the first doctoral supervisor in the field of securities investment in my country. Since then, you have been closely associated with China&#39;s securities industry. The relationship has been developing for thirty years. Why focus on securities research from now on? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I was already studying finance at that time, so I offered to be transferred. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are two opportunities: one is to alleviate poverty. In the early 1990s, I was about to become a professor and still lived in a Tongzi building with only 800 yuan in savings. At that time, someone gave me an idea, saying that you write a best-selling book, we will be responsible for selling it, and then give you a share. I thought of stocks and bonds. So I edited the &quot;Complete Book of Stocks and Bonds&quot;, which contained about 5 million words in two volumes. It was a great seller as soon as it was launched. Later, I was given some money, and I got out of poverty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because I am the editor-in-chief, people ask me to speak. This forced me to really learn securities knowledge and securities investment. This has begun to deviate from the direction of my economics research, which is entirely the study of capital markets and finance. At that time, people did not think it was a science, and even thought it was a bit &quot;crooked&quot;. An important scholar among my predecessors once talked to me. The core idea was that I should return to the mainstream track of economic research such as economic operation analysis, macroeconomics, macroeconomic management and inflation theory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The path of securities research was a sparsely traveled path at that time. There were few professional researchers, a lot of noise, and very little rational research. But in my opinion, the more in-depth securities research is, the more valuable it is. I am one of the few people left who has done research in the early stages and is still doing front-line research now. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The then president of Renmin University, Mr. Huang Da, was a professor in the Department of Finance, so I applied to go to the Department of Finance. I taught a course on securities investment. At that time, there were not many securities investment courses offered in colleges and universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;I first entered the stock market both for making money and for research&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics , Italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;There was a movie called &quot;Stock Crazy&quot; in 1994, which tells the story of the various crazes caused by mass speculation in the stock market in the early days of the stock market. Was the stock market back then really like in the movies? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>; (The craze for stock trading) has indeed begun. The stock market has begun to enter people&#39;s lives, more and more people are investing in the stock market, and various theories, methods and stock reviews have begun to appear. Because I wrote &quot;The Complete Book of Stocks and Bonds&quot;, I also started doing research on it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;As a research expert on securities investment, what will happen to you? Is stock trading practical? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It was only after 2000 that I really entered the stock market as an investor. After entering, I found that practice was more profoundly helpful to my theoretical research. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What is the difference between securities research and stock trading? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;My goal in entering this market is not only to make money, but also to do research. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I set two goals for myself at that time: first, not to lose money, and to see through practical operations whether what I learned theoretically would work in practice; second, to establish a direct perceptual understanding of the research object. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Slowly, I understand the rules of securities investment and the market better. When I write textbooks, I will be more enriched and my writing will be more vivid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During that period, I presided over the compilation of the first set of teaching materials for the securities practitioner qualification examination in China. The first edition consisted of six volumes. The general structure of the later textbooks compiled by the China Securities Regulatory Commission did not deviate from this edition. It plays a very important role in the qualification examination for securities practitioners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Have the expectations of making money been met? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I also wanted to catch the bull market and make a fortune. The first one I remember was buying Sichuan Changhong, and one day I suddenly discovered that it was going up quite well. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“&lt;strong>;The loopholes left over from the split-share structure reform must be closed &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You once said that China’s capital market has three monuments: Shanghai The establishment of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, the share-trading reform, and the pilot registration system. What have you been involved in promoting? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I participated in the share-trading reform and promoted the pilot registration system. The share-trading reform was launched in May 2005. However, since the theoretical preparation failed in 2001 when the reduction of state-owned shares failed, we began to think about how to carry out share-trading reform. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why did the reduction of state-owned shares fail in 2001? What inspiration did it provide for the subsequent share-trading reform? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;At that time, the regulatory agency believed that the reduction of state-owned shares could be reduced at market price, but it was hastily stopped due to the huge market reaction. Later analysis concluded that reducing state-owned stocks based on market prices lacked both logic and theoretical support, so it was bound to fail. As a result of this failure, we were reflecting on how to promote split-share reform. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During that period of reflection, the academic community organized many discussions, and I was probably one of the people who participated the most, whether in small-scale discussions hosted by the China Securities Regulatory Commission or in large-scale discussions. I participated in almost every discussion. Among them, the most impressive one was when Shang Fulin, then chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, called me one day in 2004 and discussed with me alone how to change the split share structure. Later, I went to his office many times to participate in discussions, with about ten people in a small group and twenty or thirty people in a large group. After discussion, we reached a consensus on two points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first point is that the split share structure reform must be promoted. If we do not promote the reform, China&#39;s capital market will have no future. This is what I also emphasize; the second point is what method should be used to reform the split-share structure reform. The design of this path is very difficult. We slowly considered that consideration reform is appropriate. Consideration reform is only a direction. It becomes more difficult to determine the appropriate consideration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I clearly remember that during a meeting of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, Tu Guangshao, then vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, asked me, what do you think is the appropriate proportion of the consideration? I said 30% or 30% off, because the price of additional issuance of stock is 30% off the circulating price. This provides a reference for the consideration of the share-trading reform. Later, practice proved that the consideration plans for the share-trading reform of various listed companies fluctuated around 30% off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the early days of the share-trading reform in 2005, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets did not Too big a reaction. The big bull market seems to have started only after 2005. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes. The share-trading reform was launched in May 2005. At that time, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets had been in the doldrums for more than four years since 2001, and the market response was lukewarm. Later, the market gradually learned that this thing was serious, and more and more people had a premonition that this was an opportunity for a big bull market. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We judged at that time that the long bear market in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets would be reversed during the share-trading reform process. After the reform is completed, it will lay a good foundation for the long-term healthy development of the capital market. From today&#39;s perspective, the general direction of the share-trading reform is correct. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The share-trading reform took about two years. What shortcomings does it have? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;From May 2005 to March 2007, 95% of listed companies completed the share-trading reform. It is a monument, but it does have flaws. This flaw is the lack of effective constraints on the reduction of major shareholders and actual controllers. This policy loophole had an important impact on the subsequent stagnation of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets for more than ten years. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have also said recently that the most important thing that seriously restricts the development of China’s capital market is the institutional design of the asset supply side. Among them, the asset supply side is mainly the reduction rules of existing assets, which is the actual Controllers and controlling shareholders do not have financial constraints to reduce their holdings, which makes it difficult for the market to grow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How do you think this loophole is being fixed now? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;On August 27, 2023, there have been some amendments in the China Securities Regulatory Commission policy. This is a loophole left by the share-trading reform, and we must make up for it. Because it seriously damages the ecological chain of capital supply and demand in the capital market and causes a serious imbalance in the capital supply relationship. At present, major loopholes are being patched, so at least we know where they are. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Registration reform has had mixed effects”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt; span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The third monument you mentioned in China’s capital market is the registration-based reform. Why start the registration system reform? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After 2007, the theoretical research, or policy formulation, that I participated in was mainly the registration system reform. Why should we carry out registration reform? Because the approval system has major flaws. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the biggest problem with the approval system is that the choice of listing a company is not left to the market, but to the Issuance Review Committee and to visible hands. The second problem is that the pricing is not market-oriented, so there is a strange phenomenon of 20 daily limit after listing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third problem is that the regulatory body and the auditing body are not separated. The China Securities Regulatory Commission both audits and supervises. This is of course problematic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the fact that the approval system has at least these three problems, if we want to correct these three defects, we must carry out the registration system reform. In accordance with the principle of marketization, the exchange adopts a flexible system, and at the same time does not adhere to the requirement that companies to be listed must be profitable. Compared with the approval system, which requires companies to be listed to be profitable for three consecutive years, one of the biggest innovations of the registration system is that major high-tech companies that are planning to be listed are allowed to have losses in the past three years, but they must have sustainable operating capabilities. This is a major change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;2023 is the first year of the comprehensive registration system reform. As a promoter and policy participant of the registration system reform, are you satisfied with the current results of the reform? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Bittersweet. Fortunately, some unicorn companies and high-tech companies have become listed companies through this mechanism. Although they are losing money in the short term, they have the ability to operate sustainably. The registration system reform naturally serves specialized and high-tech innovative enterprises, and is naturally coupled with high-tech enterprises. Only under the registration system can technology and capital markets be coupled, and we will still work in this direction in the future. I think this is of great value and significance to us in promoting the development of high-tech enterprises, transforming my country&#39;s industrial structure and upgrading and iterating industries, improving the structure of listed companies, and enhancing the investment value of China&#39;s capital market. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is worrying is the generalization of the definition of loss in the registration system. This is a serious misunderstanding, which damages market confidence and is not in line with the original meaning of the registration system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why does this vulnerability occur? What are the dangers of this vulnerability? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Like the share-trading reform, the registration-based reform also has a loophole. Frankly, no one realized it at the time. Just like designing a spacecraft, there are a lot of details and a lot of sparse details. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The loophole of the registration system is that it generalizes the market-oriented functions, or it generalizes the indicators that listed companies do not strictly require profitability. So later, some listed companies seized on such a loophole and established a so-called high-tech enterprise. Under the banner of the so-called &quot;breaking the bottleneck project&quot;, they hired dozens of researchers and started to apply for IPO after two or three years. . This has done huge damage to market confidence. They do not comply with the basic spirit of the registration system, and also exceed the requirements of the risk boundaries that a public market, exchange market, and public investors can bear. The financing of this type of enterprise should mainly be completed by PE and VC, and direct IPO is not allowed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I define this loophole as: a generalized understanding of the non-profit requirement under the registration system. This is a very serious misunderstanding, which is closely related to the subsequent stagnation of the stock market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Is this vulnerability currently being patched? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I once made it clear to the China Securities Regulatory Commission that the requirement that companies to be listed be unprofitable cannot be generalized. Judging from the recent IPO situation, the China Securities Regulatory Commission and exchanges have also paid special attention to the listing requirements of companies with negative financial indicators, especially those with negative net assets, negative cash flow, and negative profits. These major financial reporting indicators are all negative, and such companies cannot be listed. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After fixing the loopholes, the registration system reform is completed What? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Far from it. The registration-based reform is an all-round, whole-chain reform. The market-oriented reform of the issuance system is only its historical and logical starting point. It will also be followed by transactions, mergers and acquisitions, information disclosure, supervision, delisting, penalties for violations and illegal acts, legal models, etc. Adjustments in many other aspects must be incorporated into the model compatible with the registration system reform and continuously improved. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;&lt;strong>;Twin Peaks model is the ideal compromise&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong >;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In 2022, you proposed the &quot;twin peaks model&quot; of China&#39;s financial system. What are the deep observations and thoughts behind it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Frankly speaking, the first thing I proposed was the &quot;single bee mode&quot;. Around 2002, I believed that China’s future financial model would be dominated by the capital market. Twenty years have passed, and I have found that the &quot;single bee model&quot; is very difficult to achieve in China. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despite this, in the past 20 years, the scale of China&#39;s capital market has expanded relatively rapidly. From a market capitalization of two to three trillion in the past to a market capitalization of more than eighty trillion today, its proportion in the financial system has increased significantly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, I finally realized that China’s commercial banks play a huge role in China’s economic life, and China can only implement the bimodal model-the banking system and the capital market jointly dominate. This is an ideal compromise and a realistic situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why is it difficult for the capital market to become dominant? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The development of the capital market has not changed the dependence of the Chinese economy on currency and credit. From the perspective of the capital market itself, the stock prices of listed companies have not increased in the past 20 years, and the market index has not increased. Only the market value has expanded. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the number of listed companies has increased from 1,000 to more than 5,300 in the past 20 years. Almost China’s largest and best companies have achieved IPOs, including many state-owned enterprises and central enterprises. and “unicorn” companies. In a sense, the function of China&#39;s stock market in facilitating enterprise financing has been realized, but it itself is a pie-spreading expansion, constantly expanding outwards without intensive cultivation, and the unit output rate of enterprises after obtaining financing is very low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why is our index not growing? A very important reason is to go back to the two loopholes I just mentioned, especially the first loophole, which is the reduction rule, which has a huge inhibitory effect on growth. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;China’s stock market&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Why&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;is still immature&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong >;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Our capital market has developed for more than 30 years. At the age of thirty, can it be considered a mature market? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;China’s capital market has slowly found a basic direction in practice and reform, but it is still an immature market. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first immaturity is that there are many loopholes in the system design. The second immaturity lies in the lack of a deep understanding of what the capital market means to China and what it means to financial reform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, we often said that the main purpose of establishing the stock market was to facilitate corporate financing. This is an incorrect positioning and perception. The securities market appears to be financing, but is actually investment. If you don’t continuously strengthen your investment function, financing will be unsustainable, and people will vote with their feet. If you leave, how can you raise funds? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, we need to transform China’s capital market from a financing market that facilitates corporate financing to a wealth management platform and investment market for investors. Transforming from a financing market to an investment market is our future direction. It will take a long time to achieve this goal. For institutional effects to take effect, it will take time for corresponding institutional arrangements to be put in place. Our current institutional arrangements are closing loopholes and moving closer to this aspect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;A-shares are bullish and bearish. The main problem is the loopholes in the system design and Don’t really understand the significance of the capital market to financial reform? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The reason for this phenomenon in China’s capital market is not only the profound cultural and legal background, but also the misalignment of rules at the meso level. For example, there are two loopholes in the share-trading reform and the registration-based reform mentioned earlier. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, part of the reason is that our entrepreneurs do not have a deep understanding of what going public means to them. Originally, going public was a means, but these company founders suddenly discovered that it was so easy to make a fortune by going public, which was much easier than working hard in the real economy. This corroded their original intention to start a business in the past. He will take listing as his goal and stop doing the real economy. He will find a way to cash out and leave as soon as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To correct this misdirection, we can only guide it through institutional reform - only by doing a good job can you cash out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What specific suggestions do you have for this? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;To achieve a fundamental transformation of the functions and orientation of the capital market, the first step is to transform the overall macro-system design. On the asset supply side, the system design must be conducive to the transformation of market functions, the introduction of transparent and growth-producing assets into the market, and the attraction of more and more new investors and the entry of new funds into the market. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, we should have certain restrictions on all pre-listing shareholders reducing their shareholdings, especially controlling shareholders and actual controllers, including second shareholders, third shareholders, etc. How to use Financial indicators constrain shareholding reductions and require innovative system designs to allow all shareholders to focus their attention and efforts on how to do a good job in the company, create profits, and improve distribution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, we must continue to improve the ecological environment of the capital market. Whether institutional investors or individual investors, in this market, they can obtain returns commensurate with their risks, and only then will the market grow. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;&lt;strong>;The stock market continues to not improve, and we need to come up with the right response&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;At the end of July, the central government clearly proposed to &quot;activate the capital market.&quot; What signal does this send? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It should be said that the supervisory authorities have seen the problem. No field in China covers such a large scope as the capital market. There are at least 200 million investors in the capital market, and behind them may be 200 million families. Almost half of the people in China have something to do with the capital market. Second, although the global capital markets have gone through the epidemic, China&#39;s capital markets among major economies have not performed well. We need to pay more attention to the problems behind it. Third, activating the capital market is also an important measure to boost market confidence. We need to come up with the right response. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;There are also many expert suggestions for activating the capital market A shares switch from T+1 to T+0.

T+0 will directly lead to an increase in brokerage commissions, thereby driving the rise of brokerage stocks. The goal of our reform is not to make securities companies prosperous, and the original intention of activating the capital market is not to increase commissions. An increase in commissions will instead mean the leakage of capital market funds. As for what some people say that T+0 has a correction mechanism for market prices, I think more empirical research is needed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, the trading rules based on T+1 were chosen in the early days of the birth of China’s capital market and against the background of many trials and errors of trading rules. After more than 30 years of practice, they have become very mature and more Suitable for China&#39;s national conditions. I like the T+1 system very much. Why do stocks bought in the morning have to be sold in the afternoon? Since you are going to sell in the afternoon, don’t buy in the morning. The logic is very clear. If you buy it wrong, it will be the same if you sell it tomorrow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirdly, the T+1 system is not unique to China and is also very mature internationally.不见得有些国家用T+0，我们也用。从我个人来说，不太喜欢T+0，因为这个制度会把人们搞得癫狂。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末：你对中国股市有信心吗？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;吴晓求:中国股市好起来的前提是中国经济要好起来。我一直说中国经济只要想搞好，是一定能搞好的。从本质上说，中国经济基础是好的。只要发挥市场的主导作用，适应历史的趋势，遵守市场规律，尊重企业和企业家精神，推动改革开放，走市场经济之路，中国经济就一定能搞好，怎么可能搞不好？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当下中国经济的问题，主要不是周期性因素带来的。我一直坚信，只要把过去45年改革开放中被证明是成功的经验坚持下去，进一步完善，中国经济就能继续保持良好趋势，中国资本市场也就有了成长基础。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[公安部：已缉捕电信网络诈骗集团重大头目和骨干387名]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259195]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-24 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In the morning of the 24th, the State Council Information Office held a series of press conferences on the theme of &quot;Authority Departments Start Talking&quot; According to the relevant person in charge of the Ministry of Public Security, since August this year, the number of telecom network fraud cases nationwide and the number of property losses caused have dropped by 24% and 20.5% respectively year-on-year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In accordance with the unified deployment of the Ministry of Public Security, local public security agencies have continued to strengthen their crackdowns and carried out in-depth special operations such as &quot;Cloud Sword&quot;, &quot;Card Break&quot;, &quot;Cut Off&quot; and &quot;Pull Out the Nail&quot;.

When they went to the hotel and took apart the chandelier, they found that the camera was still there, which shocked them. People are extremely frightened when they think about it carefully. If someone is secretly photographed while staying in a hotel, what responsibility should the hotel bear? Hidden photography has been banned for many times. How can we eradicate the industrial chain behind it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a recent report from Guangxi TV, Mr. Hu from Nanning recently received an intimate video of himself and his fiancée staying in a hotel a year ago. When he arrived at the hotel, he discovered that the two cameras hidden in the chandelier were still there. The hotel manager said that they were also victims. There was no abnormality in other rooms after checking, and they only wanted to refund the room fee. The report attracted a lot of attention online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;News about being secretly photographed while staying in a hotel appears frequently. Searching for &quot;hotel sneak shots&quot; on a certain search engine can yield tens of millions of related information. Recent news, in addition to the above mentioned, also appeared in Lianyungang, Jiangsu, Loudi, Hunan and other places. A few years ago, the person in charge of a hotel in Zhengzhou, Henan Province even claimed that 80% of hotels had secret cameras. In fact, hidden cameras are not only found in hotels, but also in fitting rooms of clothing stores, toilets in office buildings, and even in the toilets of high-speed trains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These hidden cameras seriously violate the privacy of others and are undoubtedly illegal and criminal acts. If a hotel installs a camera without permission, the hotel will certainly be held responsible. But if someone else secretly installed it without the hotel’s knowledge, does the hotel need to take responsibility? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are indeed many such situations. According to industry insiders, bad guys can pretend to be guests staying in hotels, install cameras in just ten minutes at a time, and then change rooms for various reasons, and can secretly install several rooms at a time. In the case of a camera being discovered in a Lianyungang hotel, the suspect captured by the police was an unemployed person, not a hotel employee. In a guiding case released by the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate in 2022, criminals also secretly installed cameras in the rooms of many hotels to take photos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, is it true that, as the manager of the hotel in Nanning claimed, they are also victims and do not need to bear responsibility for the infringement of their guests? Of course not. When travelers check into a hotel, they certainly regard the hotel room as a private place and have reasonable expectations for their privacy in the room. The hotel should fulfill its reasonable obligations to protect the privacy of guests. Guests were secretly photographed and their privacy was invaded, which is inseparable from the hotel&#39;s failure to fulfill its safety and security obligations. As for this hotel in Nanning, the camera is still there more than a year later, which shows how neglected management it is. If a candid camera incident occurs, the hotel will not only have to close down for rectification, but also compensate the guests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The hotel has an obligation to protect the privacy of its guests. In fact, there are now portable detection instruments specifically for pinhole cameras on the market. As long as the hotel equips cleaning or security personnel with a set, most hidden cameras can be detected in a short time. The cost of doing this is not high. The key is that anti-candid photography should become a standard in the hotel industry and something every hotel must do, just like cleaning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why candid photography in hotels is frequently banned is because there is a black industrial chain behind it. Criminals do not secretly shoot videos for excitement, but put these secretly shot videos on the dark web and other illegal websites for sale. Some websites and social accounts use the banner of &quot;hotel secret photography&quot; to attract users to pay to watch private videos. The entire black industry of candid photography may be worth hundreds of billions of dollars every year. In the aforementioned guidance case issued by the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, criminals used illegal websites, instant messaging software, etc. to publish information and sell secretly filmed private videos. In 2021, Liaoning police also eliminated a black industry chain that used hidden cameras to secretly photograph and live broadcast in hotels for profit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to selling on the dark web, some people also use the private videos captured to extort money. At the end of 2022, after a woman in Loudi, Hunan was secretly filmed in a hotel, someone sent the video to her and extorted money. This time Mr. Hu from Nanning, Guangxi received a secretly filmed video. The other person probably did not remind him that he was secretly filmed, and it was also very possible that he was trying to blackmail him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We must intensify our crackdown on secret photography. Now that all communication accounts implement real-name systems, it shouldn&#39;t be too difficult for the police to find criminals. For those who send messages for extortion, the police can find the blackmailer through the account that sent the message, and then follow the clues to find out how the blackmailer obtained the video, as well as the customer&#39;s contact information and other private information, and eliminate the entire chain. At the same time, they can Find out whether the hotel has any issues with leaking guest privacy. After all, even if criminals secretly install cameras, it would be difficult to know the guests&#39; contact information without a hotel insider, and there would be no way to extort money. Only the secret camera was found, and the police also have the means to find the installer. The police quickly caught the suspect using the cameras of Lianyungang Hotel and the women&#39;s restroom of an office building in Tianjin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the face of rampant candid photography, on the one hand, the police must intensify their crackdown on the black industrial chain. Management of secret photography and recording equipment must also be strengthened. Nowadays, various miniature hidden cameras can be purchased everywhere on the Internet, as well as various teaching videos on camera cracking and vulnerability exploitation, which have contributed to the proliferation of candid photography. The hotel industry should also formulate standards and incorporate anti-peeping cameras into the daily management of the industry to protect the privacy and security of guests as much as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“毛孩子”上幼儿园]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258991]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-24 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/V0LTOkR67vJedXXZb5clBZd8L6rjNgVAPLvRo1Tt.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/V0LTOkR67vJedXXZb5clBZd8L6rjNgVA PLvRo1Tt. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254465&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Two &quot;students&quot; participated in the agility game course in kindergarten&lt;span style=&quot;color : #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Liang Chen/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On an autumn afternoon, three pet dogs of different types participated in games under the guidance of their dog trainers.

Pet services face the needs of different customers, so they must provide different services.

But that time there was no choice, time was tight, and the owner gave his contact information on the spot. The pet and the basic information are written on a piece of paper.
