She tried documenting her life and singing lip-syncs, but she persisted for a long time but no one took notice. In the end, the most popular works were those that were &quot;co-produced&quot; with famous Internet celebrities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;When all romance returns to nature and tranquility reaches far away, will you grow old together with me?&quot; In a video pinned to the top by Lu Ermei, photos of her and Xiucai were combined. Together, they smiled and cuddled up to each other. Amidst the accompaniment of earthy love songs and the special effects of flying red hearts, this sincere &quot;vow&quot; was played on the screen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It must be said that in addition to the purpose of operating a video account, the video also contains the admiration of the host and fans for the show. This video received more than 200 hearts and 39 comments, such as &quot;a perfect match&quot;, &quot;perfectly matched with the handsome guy&quot;, and &quot;may the scholar brother not grow old and stay with his sister until he grows old&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The price Lu Ermei paid for this was a reward of more than 100,000 yuan. &quot;There is a sister who gave a reward of more than 500,000 yuan, but she did not get it back.&quot; Before the scholar&#39;s accident, Lu Ermei regretted her lack of calmness and whims. &quot;Now that his account has been blocked, I will Very happy.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 2, 2023, the anchor Xiucai, who has tens of millions of fans and is known as the &quot;harvester of middle-aged and elderly women&quot;, had her short video account banned for violating the relevant regulations of the platform. Previously, the scholar&#39;s signature moves of pretending to be shy, lifting his hair, covering his mouth, and ogling, were imitated and parodied, and spread virally on major platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scholar’s ​​ban also exposed his “crazy fans” to the spotlight. Among Xiu Cai&#39;s fans, there are many &quot;true fans&quot; like Lu Ermei who reward hundreds of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of yuan. What kind of charm do these elderly emotional anchors have that can make fans donate generously? What are these middle-aged and elderly people who spend a lot of money really looking forward to? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Induced &quot;reflux&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Lu Ermei&#39;s hometown is Huaining County, Anhui Province, and she works in a garment factory in Changshu City, Jiangsu Province. Because she is the second eldest child in the family and is called the second sister of the Lu family, she simply named her short video account &quot;The Second Sister of the Lu Family&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She has been a fan of Xiucai for three or four years. At the beginning, Xiucai only had 500,000 or 600,000 fans, but later it skyrocketed to tens of millions. &quot;He said he was going to teach me how to make videos and asked me to help him play PK.&quot; Lu Ermei recalled the initial exchanges between the two to Southern Weekend reporters. Because she gave gifts to the scholar, she got many opportunities to communicate with him and established initial trust. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to public information, Xiucai is a 39-year-old native of Mengcheng, Anhui Province. His family background was average. In his early years, he and his wife worked in Suzhou, and their children stayed in their hometown to attend boarding school. A few years ago, at the suggestion of a classmate, I started shooting short videos. At first, they were mainly about migrant workers, and gradually turned into anchors wearing suits and singing lip-sync. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gradually, Lu Ermei came up with the idea of ​​making short videos. She posted the composite video with Xiucai on her account and accumulated some fans. However, the most direct way to get the opportunity to be exposed is to interact with the talents in the live broadcast room, and this requires buying gifts. From the most basic little hearts, gold chains, and hot air balloons to valuable Porsches and helicopters, Lu Ermei went all the way up, and she frequently received compliments from scholars: She is very beautiful, and she should listen to her brother, etc. wait. Xiucai also praised Ermei for doing a good job in her video and her fans were increasing quickly. Lu Ermei was very happy and replied, &quot;It&#39;s all because of you.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Ermei got Xiucai’s promise to help her create an account, but there were more and more requests for rewards. &quot;Just let me help him with PK, and ask me to help him in the live broadcast room.&quot; The so-called PK is a common form of popularity competition on live broadcast platforms. The anchors show off their talents or skills and call on their fans to give rewards. The method is &quot;upvote&quot;. Whoever gets the most rewards will be the winner of the PK competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the fierce competition, scholars frequently asked for rewards of &quot;carriage&quot; and &quot;Hua Zi&quot;. &quot;Hua Zi&quot; is the common name for the gift &quot;Carnival&quot;, which is equivalent to RMB 3,000. The most recent reward was more than 4,000 yuan from Lu Ermei during a live broadcast. Over the past few years, she claimed to have consumed more than 100,000 yuan in savings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It is a relatively common form to create an account and lead an apprentice.” Liangzhou (screen name) is a knowledge-based blogger on social platforms. She used to be responsible for the virtual anchor business in an MCN company. As a short-term An in-depth user and long-term observer of the video platform, she attracted attention for her series of blog posts analyzing the phenomenon of &quot;scholars&quot;. She told Southern Weekend reporters that this method of promising to teach people how to create an account in order to ask for rewards is deceptive and misleading to a certain extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liangzhou analyzed that in addition to the form of &quot;teaching how to create an account&quot;, the more direct way of inducement is to &quot;fight backflow&quot;: &quot;It is to act as a support to increase the popularity of the live broadcast room.&quot; The so-called fighting Returning means that the anchor and the fans agree in advance that the fans will help buy gifts in the live broadcast room to increase their popularity, and the anchor will refund the amount they spent in private. However, because the platform will take half of the water, the cost of returning it is very high, and because it involves data fraud, the platform does not encourage or even prohibit this behavior. Therefore, reshoring is usually an operation used by MCN organizations to recruit new talents. Personal promises to fight back are often suspected of inducement and deception. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to media reports, a 62-year-old woman from Beijing said that she rewarded scholars with more than 520,000 yuan in the form of gifts. She said that the reason for being so generous was that the scholar promised her that he would not treat her badly and would return the money, but the promise was never fulfilled. In the past three years, she has been asking Xiucai for the 520,000 yuan, but only 17,000 yuan was recovered. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;He is such a ruthless thing&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;However, Lu Ermei&#39;s short video account has not been launched, and the number of fans has remained at more than 10,000 , she did not have the financial resources to continue to reward, so the scholar stopped talking to her in the live broadcast room. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;He said he voluntarily swiped gifts, and it&#39;s impossible for others to use my mobile phone to swipe it, right?&quot; In 2021, Lu Ermei went to Mengcheng, Anhui to find a scholar to discuss the theory, but was scolded by the other party. Later, He was also blocked by the other party, saying, &quot;He is such a heartless and meaningless thing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although there are mixed ideas of making a short video account, in the minds of fans, the most attractive reason is the emotional value provided by the anchor, but this value requires money to support. &quot;This type of anchor actually has poor ability to &#39;organize&#39;.&quot; Liang Zhou analyzed that in order to attract fans, many live broadcast rooms will set up studios with lighting, props and furnishings, and have rich talent displays, and some will even design scripts. , relatively speaking, there will be much less emotional live broadcast routines for the elderly. &quot;Old people don&#39;t like to be noisy, what they need is companionship.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/UXZYTnTr7JHSV5qkyvCfGgwpNodqtpXVV7xWen9D.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;452&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/UXZYTnTr7JHSV5qkyvCfGgwpNodqtpXVV7xWen9D.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250515&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The classic shy expression of a scholar. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Internet screenshots/pictures)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liangzhou registered a new account and deliberately liked and collected videos of senior citizens to feed the account&#39;s popularity &quot;Habit&quot; opens up a new world. For the first time in the homepage recommendation, she came across a live broadcast room where the elderly were grouped together. The users who were connected were all men in their sixties. They also played PK. The audience could designate the anchor among them to &quot;open the arena&quot;. Then vote for them separately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there was no talent show in this PK, only voice chatting with fans, mostly middle-aged and elderly women. Liangzhou judged from the chat content that the two were familiar with each other and it was not the first time they were on the mic. The anchor used instant messaging software to call fans to come over and help &quot;vote.&quot; The content of the chat is also very common: What kind of tea did you drink today? Is the road easy to walk or not? If it rains, don&#39;t go out because your shoes will get muddy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;These words must not be heard by her at home.&quot; Liang Zhou said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the video and comments, the anchor ran a business when he was young and was considered a prominent figure in their local village. However, although he is much older than Xiucai, his video style is similar, with fixed scenes and fixed music, and he is usually holding a purple clay pot and making tea. The uncle’s account only has 10,000 to 20,000 fans, but the interaction volume is very high. Each video has thousands of likes, and the number of comments is close to half or one-third of the likes. Through this PK, the anchor got more than 6,000 votes, which were converted into money and he could get 300 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiucai first came out of the industry because in May 2023, a 70-year-old woman took a train alone to Mengcheng, Anhui Province to seek an offline meeting. Sister Zhang was a classmate of the scholar and had been a short video partner for a period of time. She claimed that her relationship with the scholar later deteriorated because she discovered that the scholar promised to meet his fans in private as an inducement and asked fans to give him large gifts. Sister Zhang believes that this breaks the moral bottom line and is not a very honorable thing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sister Zhang considers herself to be the leader of short videos made by scholars, and she felt ashamed to see such a situation. In July 2023, she began to publicly solicit victims who were &quot;deceived&quot; by scholars on the short video platform. . A girl in her twenties asked for help. Her parents had divorced. After her mother fell in love with a scholar, she gave him a reward of more than 10,000 yuan and talked about going to find the scholar. She and her brother could not persuade her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It’s unclear whether the old lady in her seventies came here to give him a reward, but the fact that the old lady came to us is definitely related to them.” Sister Zhang told Nanfang a reporter said over the weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Fans of Xiu Cai&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Liang Zhou also browsed the account of an active fan of the uncle anchor mentioned above. His character image is very clear: in his early career Yousheng is now widowed, her son is married and has settled in a big city, while she lives alone in her hometown. What is particularly impressive is that this woman has a strong desire to share. The most she posted was 33 videos in one day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;She seems to have no one to talk to in real life.&quot; Liang Zhou said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I support my grandma to watch short videos of scholars.” Xiao Xie is a post-90s generation who has been working for three years. She told a Southern Weekend reporter that her grandma is 68 years old and was in good health a few years ago. , I would also go to square dance. In 2022, I accidentally fell and fractured my bones. After recovery, I rarely went out and developed the habit of checking my mobile phone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiao Xie said that her grandfather had used a smartphone a few years ago and would hold it all day long. Grandpa and grandma seldom communicated with each other in daily life. After grandpa became addicted to using his mobile phone, the two of them talked less. Until grandma also used a smartphone, she gained a lot of emotional sustenance. The two elderly people often stay up until one or two o&#39;clock in the evening, &quot;you can say they are very obsessed with it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Xiao Xie found that her grandma’s ability to distinguish was very low. She used to like &quot;Fake Jin Dong&quot;, but she couldn&#39;t tell it was fake. Later, she liked Xiucai, and many video platforms gradually appeared. Even if you imitate or pretend to be a scholar’s ​​account, grandma won’t be able to tell whether it is genuine or fake. &quot;I can&#39;t tell whether it&#39;s a platform or an anchor, an organization or an individual, but she believes it anyway.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every time she goes back, grandma will explain her views on mate selection and tell her granddaughter to look for a scholar. The ideal type of boy is not only good-looking, but also very capable, and at the same time considerate and caring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Grandma also thought of giving rewards to scholars. Every time Xiao Xie goes back, she will clean up the phone memory for her grandparents and close some unreliable accounts. She discovered that her grandma’s mobile phone had received text messages indicating failure to reward and failure to bind bank cards. &quot;I&#39;m too old to do this.&quot; The two old people&#39;s mobile phones have never been bound to bank cards. The family realized that they would not waste any money, and as long as the elderly were happy, they could feel free to let them watch short videos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only the elderly, short videos are also the spiritual sustenance of Lu Ermei. &quot;Working in the factory is too tiring, and I have to move my hands and feet.&quot; Lu Ermei and his wife met in a garment factory in Changshu, Jiangsu. They have been married for more than ten years. However, over the years, her husband has worked in Changshu, Suzhou and other places. Get together less and stay apart more. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Working in a garment factory is very boring and I only have 3 days off every month. Because of making accounts and giving rewards, her relationship with her husband had a serious crisis. Her husband went to Suzhou to work alone. The two had little contact and were basically in a cold war. &quot;He (husband) was suspicious and thought I was betraying him.&quot; &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Growing old does not mean giving up all needs&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;The elderly&#39;s blind pursuit of stars is different from ours. We chase stars and buy a concert ticket. At least these things can be seen on the surface, they are internal (emotional needs).&quot; Sister Zhang said that in the spiritual world of many elderly people, emotions are relatively lacking, and their empty hearts cannot be comforted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sister Zhang added that men usually die earlier than women, leaving the old lady alone; there are also cases where men go out to make money while women stay behind, and their emotional worlds are generally empty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Before, I saw a post saying that when women reach a certain age, their secretion of hormones decreases and they lose sexual desire. This is definitely wrong.&quot; Liangzhou said that when a person enters old age, it seems that The concept of losing vitality in a social sense also means that the related lust and emotional needs should not appear in the elderly - this is obviously a very incorrect perception. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Companionship, humor, love, conversation and many other things are essential human needs. We want all these when we are young, but when we get older, age does not mean It means that we have given up all these needs. And society and the people around us should not directly ignore this series of needs. This is a manifestation of giving up basic responsibilities.&quot; Liang Zhou said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In the process of scholars becoming popular, whether it is older women or middle-aged and elderly people, I think it is understandable to like scholars.&quot; Peng Huamao, a professor at the Institute of Developmental Psychology of Beijing Normal University, has been doing psychological cognition and training for the elderly for many years. According to the research, after observing some short videos and fan messages of scholars, she believed that these messages were a relatively flamboyant emotional expression and reflected the emotional needs of the elderly. “Many of these comments are about women’s desire for emotion. , or, in other words, the awakening of one’s own emotional needs within.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Peng Huamao analyzed that the emotional needs of this group rarely receive attention from the outside world, especially among middle-aged and elderly women. &quot;When you are young, you live for your family. When you get older, your value in the family is not reflected.&quot; She said that instead of exploring why scholars are popular, it is better to pay attention to the emotional needs of middle-aged and elderly people in real life. How to satisfy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Peng Huamao said that there is a common misunderstanding in society that love will weaken with age, which makes everyone ignore the psychology of the elderly. Excessive ridicule and stigmatization will cover up the underlying problem. &quot;So, I think whether you give a reward to a scholar or pay attention to a scholar, it actually expresses that she needs a spiritual sustenance.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 16:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[华为苹果新机接连亮相，你多久会换一台手机？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256564]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-13 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In the early morning of September 13th, Beijing time, the 2023 Apple Autumn Conference arrived as scheduled.

From following Huawei and Apple, they changed their phones every year, to now they have not changed their phones for more than three years. In the second quarter of 2023, global smartphone sales fell 8% year-on-year. This is the eighth consecutive quarter in which the global smartphone market has been in decline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiaomi founder Lei Jun was once surprised that 23% of users have not changed their phones for more than three years.

Under the spotlight, these imitation jewelry, jade and precious metals made of imitation jewelry reflect brilliant light. When the girl picks them up, she also picks up her imagination of beauty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But behind the beauty, there may be hidden health risks. Many earrings and other imitation jewelry are &quot;three-no products&quot; - no production date, no quality certificate, no manufacturer, and even harmful elements such as cadmium, nickel, and lead exceed the standard. Wearing them may cause &quot;allergy&quot; and threaten your health. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The mandatory national standard &quot;Regulations on Limits of Hazardous Elements in Jewelry&quot; (GB 28480-2012) regulates harmful elements in non-precious metals (precious metals mainly refer to 8 metal elements such as gold, silver and platinum group metals) Relevant regulations have been set on the limit. Because piercings are in contact with the human body, earrings are more stringent than jewelry such as necklaces that are in contact with human skin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it has been ten years since the implementation of national standards. Due to high testing costs and lack of mandatory requirements, cases and recalls of alloy earrings and other imitation jewelry containing harmful elements exceeding the standard are still common. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The amount of cadmium released in &quot;hot-selling&quot; earrings exceeds the standard by more than 7,000 times&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;What is the quality of &quot;hot-selling&quot; earrings with a total sales volume of more than 60,000 pieces and an average price of more than five yuan? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2023, on an e-commerce platform, the non-toxic pioneer team of the environmental organization Shenzhen Zero Waste Environmental Protection Public Welfare Development Center (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;non-toxic pioneer&quot;) placed an order for the top-selling product 10 styles of earrings were sent to a qualified third-party laboratory for testing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;None of these 10 earrings have quality certificates, product names, manufacturer and other information labels. They are &quot;three noes&quot; products and violate the product quality law. The test report even showed that cadmium content in 3 models exceeded the standard by 6808 times, 6872 times, and 7208 times; nickel release in 4 models exceeded the standard by 0.25 times, 0.5 times, 0.5 times, and 1.8 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/oYt6uFkA6kDbYxGTmA7M4spKESuOui1aCpS6Apd2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height= &quot;1332&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/oYt6uFkA6kDbYxGTmA7M4spKESuOui1aCpS6Apd2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250507&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Test results of harmful elements in 10 earrings. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Non-Toxic Pioneer/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After &quot;Non-Toxic Pioneer&quot; reported to the e-commerce platform, 6 products with excessive heavy metals have been downloaded shelf. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a customer, Southern Weekend reporters inquired about the certificates of other products sold by these merchants. Some said that they “have no quality certificates,” while others claimed that they “have them but it is not convenient to provide them.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not uncommon for imitation jewelry to contain harmful elements that exceed standards. In 2014, authors from the Zhuhai Quality, Metrology, Supervision and Inspection Institute published a paper stating that after testing 40 pieces of imitation jewelry in Zhuhai’s retail market, 19 items contained excessive levels of harmful elements, indicating “the overall quality problem is very serious.” There is basically no ingredient description on the packaging or markings of jewelry. Even large imitation jewelry processing companies only use names such as &quot;alloy/silver-plated/gold-plated jewelry&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, an author from the Guangdong Product Quality Supervision and Inspection Institute published a paper: 50 batches of simulated jewelry purchased on an online platform and the Guangzhou Jewelry Wholesale Market were tested, and 11 batches of harmful elements exceeded the standard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Suqing, director of the National Jewelry Quality Inspection and Testing Center, is one of the drafters of the national standard &quot;Regulations on Limits of Hazardous Elements in Jewelry&quot;. She told Southern Weekend reporters that in 2007 and 2010, for domestic imitation jewelry , the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) twice proposed large-scale recalls, which attracted the attention of domestic regulatory authorities and promoted the introduction of national standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;my country’s supervision of the export of imitation jewelry is also becoming increasingly strict. Starting from January 1, 2011, imitation jewelry has been included in my country&#39;s import and export legal inspection product catalog - the import and export commodities that must be inspected are formulated and adjusted by the national commodity inspection department. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even so, news of recalls of exported jewelry has remained frequent in recent years. On the official website of the &quot;Hebei Provincial Defective Product Recall Management Center&quot;, search with &quot;earrings&quot; as the keyword, from March 2018 to November 2022, there are 62 earring product recall information released by the EU, most of which are produced in China, and the defects are all Excessive levels of harmful elements such as cadmium, nickel or lead. According to statistics from the testing agency &quot;ETC Les Testing&quot;, in the second quarter of 2021, there were 66 recall notifications for imitation jewelry from European countries and Canada, including 41 cases of Chinese jewelry. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;There is still a lack of quantitative research on the health effects&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Many people have this experience. Their skin becomes red or even allergic when wearing jewelry, especially earrings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Jinliang, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Environmental Sciences, told Southern Weekend reporters that in addition to being related to personal constitution, another main reason for allergies may be that the amount of nickel released from jewelry exceeds the standard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/jF5c9yTRnuv4kqrnnCTfDps3iCEoNsD9dw89Qzv2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/jF5c9yTRnuv4kqrnnCTfDps3iCEoNsD9dw89Qzv2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250511&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Four earrings that were found to have excessive nickel. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Non-Toxic Pioneer/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The production process of simulated jewelry includes design, molding, sand casting, welding, polishing, electroplating, etc. Through multiple processes, harmful elements such as cadmium, nickel, and lead appear to be excessive, in order to make the jewelry more beautiful and cost-effective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Hua, a designer at a jewelry factory in the south, said that nickel is mainly produced in the electroplating process. The worse the electroplating process, the lower the cost, and the easier it is to release nickel. Zhang Jinliang said that in the production of jewelry, adding cadmium will increase the gloss and have an anti-rust effect. Adding lead can improve the flexibility of the jewelry and facilitate shaping. Lead and cadmium are also the main components of many pigments. If cheap earrings and other jewelry are rich in color, the content of these two harmful elements is more likely to exceed the standard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/guumhbZZDicrgBhye5ii4ryU5TZwZspWZmmQXGHl.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;353&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/guumhbZZDicrgBhye5ii4ryU5TZwZspWZmmQXGHl.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250508&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Three earrings that were found to have excessive levels of cadmium were all around 7,000 times the standard. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Non-toxic Pioneer/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The quality of raw materials is also very important. Zhang Jinliang said that the raw materials of some jewelry are scrap metal or low-quality alloys, which are cheap and may cause excessive heavy metal content. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The harmful elements in jewelry exceed the standard and will threaten human health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Jinliang said that nickel can easily cause skin contact allergies, and long-term exposure to nickel may cause contact dermatitis, neurasthenia, and cancer reactions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cadmium has been certified as a carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), and is listed as the sixth toxic substance harmful to human health by the United Nations Environment Program and the International Committee on Heavy Metals in Occupational Health. Chronic intake may cause high blood pressure, increase a person&#39;s risk of diabetes, and even cause severe bone damage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the alloy earrings tested by Non-Toxic Pioneer, 8 models were found to contain lead. Although the content meets the standard, it is still not recommended to wear them. Because lead is a cumulative poison that can enter the human body through the respiratory tract, digestive tract, skin, etc., lead poisoning will occur when the accumulation reaches a certain value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Simulation jewelry with substandard quality is more harmful to children’s health. Children like to bite jewelry, and some lead products have a sweet taste. Scientific research has proven that the absorption rate of lead in the respiratory tract and lungs of children is much higher than that of adults. my country and other countries have also specifically set limits on harmful elements for jewelry worn by children ≤14 years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there have been cases of recalls of children&#39;s jewelry in recent years. For example, from March 12 to 22, 2021, Health Canada issued 4 recall notices for children&#39;s imitation jewelry, involving 4 products, a total of 3,904 pieces, all produced in China. The reason for the recall was the lead and cadmium content in the products. Exceeds local standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Zhang Jinliang also said that the toxicity of harmful elements is only a theoretical statement. Heavy metals mainly enter the human body through the respiratory tract and digestive tract, and the skin absorption is relatively small. At present, there is no quantitative research data on the impact of heavy metal exposure in earrings on human health; in addition, the piercing part of earrings has a small contact area with the human body. If the heavy metal exceeds the standard, it may cause some adverse reactions, but the probability of causing heavy metal poisoning is very high. Small, &quot;so there is no need to be too alarmist.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Jinliang suggested that if you wear earrings and other jewelry for a long time, try to choose precious metals such as gold, silver, and platinum. Their supervision is more standardized and their quality is better. Alloy jewelry with many styles, good shapes and low prices has different usage scenarios from precious metals. You can clean it with alcohol before wearing it, which will help reduce the exposure of heavy metals on the surface of the jewelry. Try not to wear alloy jewelry when exercising, bathing, swimming, etc. , because sweat may increase heavy metal exposure after contact with the alloy. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;There are hidden tricks in the testing industry&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;my country&#39;s imitation jewelry industry started in the 1980s. China is currently the world&#39;s largest exporter of imitation jewelry, forming three major distribution centers in Yiwu, Qingdao and Guangzhou. According to data from Yiwu City, there are more than 300,000 employees in Yiwu&#39;s jewelry industry, with annual sales of more than 20 billion yuan, accounting for more than 2/3 of the total output value of the national jewelry industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/gRmBhVAobWJmAbyX2sObDLPh7cQTxyOheciRUyAC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/gRmBhVAobWJmAbyX2sObDLPh7cQTxyOheciRUyAC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250509&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In November 2017, Qingdao Airport Inspection and Quarantine Bureau and Liuting Airport Customs sampled a batch of incoming imitation jewelry and sent it to the laboratory for testing. The results showed that the sample of imitation jewelry contained lead. More than 30 times more than the standard. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Simulated jewelry exported for sale on international e-commerce platforms such as Amazon must provide testing certificates that comply with local standards. For example, the European Union and Amazon require merchants to provide statements or test reports that can prove that products comply with &quot;REACH&quot; (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals of the European Parliament and of the Council) regulations, including values ​​for harmful elements such as cadmium, nickel, and lead. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many third-party testing companies provide testing services, but a Southern Weekend reporter’s investigation found that there are hidden “tricks” in the testing industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporter consulted as a jewelry manufacturer and found that the charge for testing the release of cadmium, nickel, and lead is between 500 yuan and 800 yuan per sample, and the time required is about 7 working days. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For many imitation jewelry, this testing fee is equivalent to the cost of hundreds of products, so there are &quot;hidden rules&quot; for testing services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It’s possible to play around with the edges.” The customer service of a testing agency on Taobao said that REACH requires each product to provide a test report, but the agency can only conduct one actual test for multiple jewelry with similar materials, and other &quot; For &quot;Hitchhiking&quot; products that have not been tested, if you replace the photos with them and the test values ​​remain unchanged, you will also have an &quot;exclusive&quot; test report. The above-mentioned customer service stated that the agency can support a maximum of 10 packages for testing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The customer service of some institutions also introduced the &quot;hidden rules&quot; for packaging and testing in larger quantities. &quot;More than 100 models (packaged for testing) are a bit exaggerated, because export customs clearance and selling on the platform are risky, and the customs and the platform may doubt the authenticity of the test report.&quot; Yang Le, customer service of this testing agency, said to the south A reporter from the weekend said that this kind of demand from customers is very common. &quot;Considering cost issues, it is impossible to test every product, so our customers will put many products together for testing in the name of &#39;series&#39;.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Le said that if jewelry companies are worried that the actual measured harmful elements in their products exceed the standard, they can also provide a &quot;certificate package&quot; service and issue a non-actually measured test report, and the test results can be filled in at will. &quot;This test report must also be uploaded and filed. Although we have not tested it, it is exactly the same as the test report of the actual test.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the premise of &quot;guaranteed certificate&quot; is that the customer needs to sign a contract with the testing agency Disclaimer, exempting the testing company from liability. The disclaimer template sent by Yang Le reads: &quot;In consideration of the time relationship of customer needs, after negotiation between the two parties, the testing agency evaluates and issues certificates and reports according to customer requirements. At the same time, the customer promises that the product is qualified and ensures that the products in the sales market meet the requirements. If there is any non-compliance, the testing agency will not assume any legal responsibility or compensation obligations.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Le said that the fee for &quot;package certificate&quot; and packaged testing of multiple products are the same, both 700 yuan. Since the &quot;certificate package&quot; does not require actual testing, it only takes 5 working days to complete. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;New standards are being revised&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Similar to most products, the supervision of imitation jewelry is based on laws and regulations such as the Product Quality Law and the Import and Export Commodity Inspection Law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Product Quality Law stipulates that producers shall be responsible for the quality of the products they produce; if there are national standards and industry standards to protect human health and personal and property safety, product quality shall comply with such standards. Li Suqing said that the simulation jewelry produced and sold by merchants must meet the national standard requirements, but when it is launched in the country, it is not required to undergo compulsory product certification like food, home appliances and other consumer goods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, home appliances must obtain &quot;3C Certification&quot; (China Compulsory Certification, China Compulsory Product Certification) before they can be put on the market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Suqing believes that if imitation jewelry is included in the 3C compulsory catalog, there will be difficulties and controversy. For earrings that sell for a few yuan, it is unrealistic to ask merchants to spend hundreds of yuan to detect harmful elements. &quot;It will not only increase the costs for merchants and consumers, but also increase the cost of law enforcement.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The market supervision department mainly adopts random inspections to supervise imitation jewelry. For example, Yiwu City has carried out several special rectifications on alloy jewelry and carried out supervision and spot inspections on an annual basis. The 17 batches of products randomly inspected in 2022 were all qualified after being tested by third-party testing agencies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, whether simulated jewelry is sent for inspection mainly depends on customer demand. &quot;Many customers do not need test reports because it will increase costs.&quot; Li Hua said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A senior person in the testing industry told Southern Weekend reporters that in China, e-commerce platforms such as Tmall and JD.com and some large supermarkets will require merchants to provide quality inspection reports for jewelry, but some e-commerce platforms Commercial platforms and many offline sales venues do not require this. Li Benben, communications director of the Shenzhen Zero Waste Environmental Protection Public Welfare Development Center, said that Toxic-Free Pioneer plans to collect more earring samples from multiple e-commerce platforms in 2024 to investigate product quality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Suqing suggested that to improve the qualification rate of imitation jewelry, the illegal costs of enterprises must be increased. According to public information, few jewelry manufacturers have been punished for substandard harmful elements in their products. The Product Quality Law stipulates that those who produce or sell products that do not meet the national standards for protecting human health and personal and property safety may be fined not less than three times the value of the illegally produced or sold products; if the circumstances are serious, the product may be revoked. Business license; if it constitutes a crime, criminal liability will be pursued in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The shapes of earrings and other accessories are becoming more and more complex, and the ingredients are not only simulated metals, but also textiles and even batteries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Suqing revealed that the national standard promulgated 11 years ago is being revised. The new version of the national standard in terms of chemical properties may further tighten the limit requirements on lead content; it may also add some requirements on mechanical and physical properties. For example, there are certain regulations on the position of jewelry needle tips and battery-containing jewelry. The specific changes will be subject to the final standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Li Hua and Yang Le are pseudonyms, Southern Weekend intern Liang Chengyuan also contributed)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/ p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx .net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt; /div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[公职人员做发型被拒，税务局翌日上门查税：这样的营商环境如何让人安心丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256530]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-13 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a woman in Tancheng County, Linyi City, Shandong Province threatened a barber shop by showing photos of her uniform, which became a trend on social media. Search. On September 8, the Tancheng County Joint Investigation Team reported that the woman was a staff member of the County Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau, and she was given a major demerit. This incident cannot be taken lightly, because it is not just a matter of &quot;the low quality of individual public officials&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to an interview with Mr. Xu, the owner of the barber shop, by Chinese Business Daily, Dafeng News and other media, on August 30, the woman came to the shop to do a &quot;protein correction&quot; hair care project. The hairstylist assessed her hair and said her hair was too dry to do the job. As a result, the woman showed the &quot;uniform photo&quot; on her mobile phone and threatened to &quot;call people from our brigade to come (investigate and deal with the case).&quot; Mr. Xu thought she was just saying harsh words to scare people, but he didn’t expect that tax bureau personnel would come to check the tax the next day. After confirming that there was no tax evasion problem in the barber shop, they would also ask for every account of Charlie’s hair shop since it opened. Mr. Xu was so angry that he posted the surveillance video online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Netizens have speculated who this woman is. She can easily mobilize the tax bureau to investigate taxes if she is unhappy. However, both the Tancheng County Taxation Bureau and the Market Supervision Bureau denied that the woman was their staff. After the video attracted attention online, on September 6, two men who claimed to be the woman&#39;s colleagues went to the barber shop to apologize to the owner, but still did not reveal what company she worked for. It was not until this incident became more and more intense online that Tancheng County issued a notice in the name of the joint investigation team on September 8, confirming that the woman was Wang Moumou, a staff member of the county&#39;s Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What this Wang Moumou did reminds people of the &quot;borrowed personnel&quot; of a certain district transportation bureau in Harbin more than a year ago. Because the online ride-hailing driver refused to allow him to smoke in the car, he called the &quot;brothers&quot; from the Transportation Bureau to check on illegal cars and &quot;deal with&quot; the online ride-hailing driver. Why do public officials dare to call &quot;brothers&quot; to inspect cars when they are not performing official duties, or threaten barbershops by showing photos of themselves in uniform? I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s still a sense of superiority: If you don&#39;t follow my requirements, I can punish you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the one from Harbin is from the Transportation Bureau (although he is &quot;borrowed&quot;) and has the power to investigate and deal with illegally operated vehicles, so he can &quot;handle&quot; online ride-hailing drivers. And this Wang Moumou from Tancheng is from the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau. How could Wang Moumou mobilize the tax bureau to investigate taxes? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Tancheng County’s official announcement, she called the 12345 citizen hotline to report the incident. However, most netizens are skeptical about this. After the woman made the threat, the tax bureau came to inspect the tax the next day. Moreover, after the tax bureau confirmed that the barber shop had just opened for a few months and had not yet reached the tax filing period and that there was no tax evasion problem, it also demanded every account from Charlie&#39;s hair shop since its opening on the grounds that the whistleblower was not satisfied. If an ordinary citizen calls the hotline to report, will the tax bureau respond so quickly? Will every account within a few months be verified after confirming that there is no tax evasion? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Netizens’ doubts are not unreasonable. Why is the tax bureau so concerned about such a report? Relevant parties in Tancheng County should disclose Wang&#39;s phone recordings or online reporting records to clarify the facts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to showing off his power and threatening the store, netizens also suspected that Wang Moumou was absent from work at will. According to video surveillance, the incident occurred at about 9:40 a.m. on August 30. Tancheng County did not explain in its report why Wang Moumou could go to the barber shop to have his hair done on Wednesday morning. Does the Agricultural and Rural Affairs Bureau&#39;s &quot;lax management of staff&quot; mentioned in the bulletin include its lax management of attendance? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind this incident are public concerns about the local business environment. Just imagine, an ordinary public official can show off his power and threaten, and he can torment operators at will with just a phone call. Who would dare to come here to invest and start a business? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From this perspective, the investigation and processing results reported by the Tancheng County Joint Investigation Team may be difficult to eliminate public doubts about the local business environment. In an interview with CCTV, the barber shop owner said that he &quot;hopes that the normal operation of the barber shop will not be affected in the future.&quot; This also shows that he is still worried about whether he can operate normally in the future and whether he will be retaliated against again. Relevant parties in Tancheng need to disclose the incident more transparently, and at the same time introduce corresponding measures to prevent merchants operating normally from being unreasonably tortured just because of a &quot;reporting phone number.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[IPO收紧撤单潮起：36起超370亿募资喊停]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256518]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-13 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Since the China Securities Regulatory Commission made it clear at the end of August that it would tighten IPOs in stages, the long-rumored market listing has become more difficult. It started slowly but gradually became solid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Comprehensive interviews and research by reporters from the 21st Century Business Herald found that, in fact, as early as July 24, when the Political Bureau meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China first proposed &quot;activating the capital market and boosting investor confidence,&quot; IPOs had already become obvious. Be strict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Wind data statistics, from July 24 to September 10, a total of 36 companies planning to IPO on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges withdrew or terminated their registration. Among them, there are up to 18 companies on the GEM, 4 on the Science and Technology Innovation Board, 11 on the Shanghai Stock Exchange Main Board, and 3 on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange Main Board, raising a total of 37.814 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/12/5a2dfc0c3241535e10176d2e83b60319.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;700&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/12/5a2dfc0c3241535e10176d2e83b60319.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;250411&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;h4>;The net profit threshold for listing is raised&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;A senior insurance agent of a leading brokerage firm who has been in the industry for nearly 20 years told reporters that whenever IPOs are tightened, net profit often becomes a &quot;hard indicator&quot; for listing, and various sectors have The requirements for net profit bottom line have increased. Today, this situation appears again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In the past, the main board could achieve success with a net profit of 80 million yuan, but now it is basically hopeless if it is less than 100 million yuan. It was more likely that the GEM would be listed at 60 million yuan last year, but now it is almost impossible to achieve less than 80 million yuan. . The fifth set of standards for the Science and Technology Innovation Board has been suspended. Once there is a large loss, even hard-core technology companies will not be able to go public. For companies with technological attributes but not hard enough, as long as they suffer losses, the listing process is likely to be blocked. Moreover, each sector has a negative impact on the listing process. The net profit requirement is not only for the most recent fiscal year. If there has been substandard performance or performance decline in recent years, sustainable profitability will be questioned, and it is also likely to be stopped.&quot; The above-mentioned Baodai told reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from Wind data, the statement of the senior insurance agent has been confirmed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From July 24th to September 10th, a total of three companies on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange main board withdrew, two of which had a net profit of less than 90 million yuan; although the other one had a net profit of 122 million yuan in 2022, it will not be listed in 2021. The annual net profit was only 94 million yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 20.39%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the 11 companies withdrew from the Shanghai Stock Exchange Main Board, 4 had net profits of less than 90 million yuan last year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the 18 companies withdrawn from the GEM, 12 will have a net profit of less than 80 million yuan in 2022, accounting for as high as 66.67%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of the four companies withdrawn from the Science and Technology Innovation Board, three have suffered losses in the past two years. Among them, Shugen Internet Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Sroot Internet&quot;), a hard-core technology company focusing on software applications, has no choice but to withdraw. Its losses since 2021 have been more than 700 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“For a hard technology company like Shugen Internet, which has suffered huge losses year after year, it is naturally impossible for it to be listed on the main board or GEM. However, it has stepped on the industry trend supported by policies and placed itself on the During the loose period of IPO, it was possible to rush forward according to the fifth set of standards of the Science and Technology Innovation Board, but now that the fifth set of standards is suspended, its listing process can only come to an end.&quot; Baodai said bluntly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that the fifth set of standards of the Science and Technology Innovation Board is not universal, but a green channel specially opened for star companies in special industries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the requirements, companies that meet the fifth set of standards need to &quot;break through key core technologies and possess original leading technologies.&quot; Such companies may be listed on the Science and Technology Innovation Board even if they are in the research and development stage without generating revenue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As Baodai said, the fifth set of standards is now suspended, which means that regardless of the technological attributes of a company, if it wants to go public, it must not suffer a significant loss, and must even maintain a stable net profit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“For companies, it will be more difficult to go public and subsequent financing will become more difficult; for investment banks, the number of projects that can be sponsored will decrease and underwriting income will decline. Naturally, they will suffer losses and do not want to see it. &quot;Another industry insider told reporters, &quot;But for investors, it is a kind of protection. Excluding loss-making companies and companies with relatively low profitability from the stock market will, on the one hand, effectively improve the quality of newly listed companies. It helps investors select high-quality stocks; on the other hand, it forces more funds to flow into existing stocks, which helps stabilize stock prices.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/23/09/12/e594ea773537f379c1452f71c5c2b28e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;606&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com /cms/medias/image/23/09/12/e594ea773537f379c1452f71c5c2b28e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;250412&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>; Image source: Visual China&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Capital-driven companies have little hope of going public&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to investment bank insurance agents, in addition to the increase in net profit requirements, the number of years on the market is also a factor in whether a company can succeed. IPO assessment factors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The purpose of assessing the number of years on the market is to determine whether the company is capital-driven.” An investment bank insurance agent told reporters. At present, in addition to emerging fields, hard technology and other industries, regulators expect listed companies to be established for more than ten or even twenty years, rely on their own strength to become stronger and bigger, and become leaders in subdivided industries before listing. Instead of relying on multiple rounds of financing driven by capital, IPO can be achieved in just a few years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason for this is that the insurance agent believes that there are two main points: on the one hand, from the perspective of the purpose of listing, compared with companies that have been operating for many years and then apply for listing, companies that have been established for a shorter period of time and rely on capital to promote, After listing, there is a greater probability that relevant shareholders will reduce their holdings and cash out. On the other hand, companies that have been established for a longer time are more likely to enter the maturity stage, have more stable operating performance, and have relatively less risk of performance changes after listing, which is more conducive to safeguarding the interests of investors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Wind, as of September 10, among the 36 IPO projects that have been withdrawn since July 24, 7 projects are located in companies that have been established within 10 years, and 5 were established in 2016 or 2017. Newly established in the year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, Zhejiang Tongfute Meike Household Products Co., Ltd., which was established in 2017 and plans to be listed on the main board of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, has performed well in terms of operating income and net profit in recent years. A net profit of 126 million yuan was achieved in 2021, and the net profit in the first half of last year reached 97 million yuan; operating income is also relatively high, with operating income of 1.948 billion yuan for the whole year of 2021, and operating income from January to June 2022 totaling 916 million yuan. Since 2020, operating income and net profit have increased by more than 20% year-on-year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the above-mentioned insurance agent also mentioned that the age of establishment is an important factor in whether a company can successfully IPO, but it is not an absolute factor. If the company has good quality, stable ability to continue operating, and broad prospects in the field, even if it is only established for In a few years, there is also the possibility of going public. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Food, clothing, housing, and pharmaceutical companies concentrated on withdrawing orders&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In mid-August, there was news in the market that there was basically no hope of IPO listing of new shares of food, clothing, housing, and housing companies. At that time, the relevant cancellation data was not yet clear. Now, this statement is gradually supported. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Wind, from September 4th to 6th, three food companies stopped IPOing, one of which has a net profit of over 100 million since 2021 and continues to grow. If the statistical time is advanced to August 14, the number of food, clothing and housing companies that have been forced to terminate the IPO process will reach 7. All seven companies plan to list on the Shanghai Stock Exchange main board. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since July 24, a total of 11 companies have withdrawn orders from the Shanghai Stock Exchange main board. This means that among the companies with orders withdrawn from the main board of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, companies related to food, clothing and housing account for more than 60%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, Ocean Family (Zhejiang) Co., Ltd., which terminated its IPO on August 14, was established in 2009. Since 2020, its net profit has been the lowest at 198 million yuan and operating income at the lowest at 1.835 billion yuan. Its performance far exceeds Motherboard profit requirements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that, judging from the industries of the companies that have withdrawn orders, in addition to clothing, food and housing companies, pharmaceutical companies with good operating performance and longer establishment years also have relatively more cancellations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since July 24, a total of four pharmaceutical manufacturing companies have terminated the IPO process. Among them, Fujian Mindong Lijiexun Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., which is preparing for the GEM, was established in 1997. From 2020 to 2022, its net profits were 87 million yuan, 73 million yuan and 98 million yuan respectively, far exceeding those on the GEM. Profit requirements, wipe existing profit standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tianjin Tongrentang, a time-honored brand in the traditional Chinese medicine industry founded in 1981, also failed to go public as expected. Its operating income and net profit have increased year by year since 2020. From January to June this year, operating income and net profit have reached 577 million yuan and 144 million yuan respectively, which is several times higher than the profit requirements of the GEM. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[抗癌且延寿——裸鼹鼠体内的神奇能力]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256544]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-13 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Both ancient and modern people, most people hope to be healthy and live a long life. The ancients made elixirs to seek the elixir of immortality, while modern scientists explore the secrets of longevity from animals. For example, scientists have discovered something that people have long dreamed of in the naked mole rat, a rodent with sparse hair and wrinkled skin that likes to live on the ground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This amazing story began ten years ago. Ten years ago, researchers at the University of Rochester announced on the website of Nature that they had discovered an anti-cancer ingredient, high molecular weight hyaluronic acid (HMW-HA), from naked mole rats. Ten years have passed, and on August 23, 2023, the team once again published a more interesting study on the &quot;Nature&quot; magazine website. They found a gene responsible for making high-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid and transferred it into mice. As a result, the mice&#39;s health improved, they had significant anti-tumor properties, and their lifespans were extended. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/12/mTnNMgewFJdbzlzWoxQSrfgbcH7NnQM7lEHNpH5d.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1231&quot; height= &quot;692&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/12/mTnNMgewFJdbzlzWoxQSrfgbcH7NnQM7lEHNpH5d.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250454&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The long-lived and cancer-resistant naked mole rat. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Amazing abilities&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;University of Rochester Biology The reason why Professors Vera Gorbunova and Andrei Seluanov studied naked mole rats was not their initial interest in the longevity characteristics of naked mole rats, but their innate Anti-cancer mechanism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mice and rats are the most common experimental animals, but their life span is generally only 3-4 years, and the incidence of tumors is relatively high, so they cannot be used to study anti-cancer mechanisms. Therefore, Professor Gerbunova The Rochester research team, co-led by Professor Seluan Ruf, focused their attention on naked mole rats. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The naked mole rat is a magical rodent that is native to Africa. It lives underground most of the time and feeds mainly on ants and other insects. Compared with common rodents such as mice and rats, naked mole rats have sparse body hair, exposed flesh-colored skin, and are not good-looking. What interests biologists is that naked mole rats have a long lifespan. Their lifespan can reach 30-40 years, which is more than 10 times that of rodents of the same size. Not only do naked mole rats live long lives, they also have extraordinary cancer-fighting abilities. According to scientists’ years of observations of large naked mole rat groups, naturally occurring cancer has not been observed in naked mole rats, and it is difficult to induce cancer in them through experiments. This makes naked mole rats a prime candidate for scientists to study new anti-cancer methods. Ideal animal model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why are naked mole rats not prone to cancer? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In previous studies, the Rochester research team found that naked mole rat cells have the ability to inhibit early contact. Contact inhibition is a powerful anticancer mechanism. Normally, when cells come into contact with each other, receptors on the cell surface sense other cells and send a &quot;brake&quot; signal to the interior of the cell to prevent the cell from continuing to grow. However, this mechanism fails in cancer cells. As a result, cancer cells cannot be suppressed even under high-density conditions, and continue to grow wildly until they accumulate into multi-layered lesions. Naked mole rat cells will show contact inhibition at lower densities, while mouse cells need to reach more than three times the concentration of naked mole rat cells to show similar contact inhibition. Therefore, the research team believes that naked mole rats have Early contact inhibition, while other mammalian cells such as mice only have conventional contact inhibition capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, how does early contact inhibition develop in naked mole rats? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The researchers found that the protein kinase inhibitor P16 mediated early contact inhibition in naked mole rat cells, while the protein kinase inhibitor P27 mediated regular contact inhibition in other mammalian cells. When P16 mutates and loses its normal function, the early contact inhibition mechanism of naked mole rat cells will be destroyed, and only conventional contact inhibition can be performed, making malignant transformation and even cancer more likely to occur. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This study did not attract much attention, but it opened the door for the Rochester research team to study the anti-cancer mechanism of naked mole rats. Even greater discoveries are yet to come. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Cancer-fighting genes&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Rochester research team continues to observe the growth of naked mole rat cells and compare them with mammals such as humans, guinea pigs and mice. Comparing the cells, they found that compared to other mammalian cells, the naked mole rat cells in the dish quickly became viscous, like syrup. After analysis, scientists found that naked mole rat cells secrete large amounts of high-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hyaluronic acid is an acidic mucopolysaccharide, also known as hyaluronic acid. Hyaluronic acid is commonly found in mammalian skin, cartilage, and other connective tissues and is widely used in pharmaceutical products and cosmetics. Hyaluronic acid mainly acts as a filler and support between animal cells. According to the molecular weight, hyaluronic acid can generally be divided into high molecular weight hyaluronic acid and low molecular weight hyaluronic acid. The hyaluronic acid secreted by naked mole rat cells is mainly high molecular weight and is secreted by other mammals such as humans, mice and guinea pigs. 2-5 times the molecular weight of hyaluronic acid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through further research and analysis, the Rochester research team found that high molecular weight hyaluronic acid is a key extracellular signal for the formation of early contact inhibition in naked mole rat cells, that is, these cells secrete large amounts of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid to cause It floods between cells and forms physical constraints. Naked mole rat cells sense the hyaluronic acid signal secreted by the other party and their growth slows down. Therefore, they can undergo contact inhibition earlier than other mammalian cells and are less likely to undergo cancer. of crazy growth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why can naked mole rat cells alone secrete large amounts of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It turns out that in vertebrate cells, there are three types of hyaluronic acid synthases responsible for producing high molecular weight hyaluronic acid, including HAS1, HAS2 and HAS3. Among them, HAS1 and HAS3 have nothing in various mammals. The difference is that only the HAS2 molecule has undergone important mutations in naked mole rats. The HAS2 molecule consists of 552 amino acids, and these amino acid sequences are highly conserved in other mammals, but the naked mole rat version has two key amino acid substitutions. This mutation causes naked mole rat cells to secrete large amounts of high-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid. At the same time, the hyaluronic acid-degrading enzyme activity of naked mole rat cells is also much lower than that of other mammals, resulting in slower degradation of high-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid. Once the HAS2 gene of naked mole rat cells is destroyed through genetic engineering technology, or the hyaluronic acid degrading enzyme is over-synthesized, the high molecular weight hyaluronic acid in the genetically modified naked mole rat will be greatly reduced, and its early contact inhibition function will be reduced. Along with the loss, these naked mole rats are also prone to induce tumors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These studies prove that high molecular weight hyaluronic acid is a unique anti-cancer factor in naked mole rats and will bring new ways to prevent cancer. In July 2013, this research was published in the internationally renowned academic journal &quot;Nature&quot;. This was also the first time that the research team of Professor Gerbunova and Professor Seluanruf published a paper in the &quot;Nature&quot; magazine. In this paper, they also transferred the HAS2 gene from naked mole rats into human cells and observed that the transgenic human cells could also synthesize high-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid in large quantities, laying the foundation for another blockbuster study ten years later. A foreshadowing was made. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Double surprise&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Since naked mole rats are less susceptible to cancer under the protection of rich high molecular weight hyaluronic acid, if other mammals can also Can synthetic high molecular weight hyaluronic acid reproduce the anti-cancer and life-extending effects seen in naked mole rats? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the ultimate goal of the research team of Professors Gerbunova and Professor Seluanruf is to find anti-cancer and life-extending drugs for humans, it is obviously not suitable to directly use them in human trials when the research is not yet mature. Research on human cells cannot completely simulate the effects on the human body, so trying it on mice first is a very good choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The research idea and process are simple, but the results are surprising. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The research team of Professors Gerbunova and Professor Seluanruf transferred the HAS2 gene, which is responsible for the production of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid, into mice to create transgenic mice. It was found that these transgenic mice The content of hyaluronic acid increased significantly, especially high molecular weight hyaluronic acid was detected in organs such as muscle, heart, kidney and small intestine. However, the hyaluronic acid content in the transgenic mice was not as high as that in the naked mole rats. The researchers speculated that it may be mainly because the hyaluronic acid-degrading enzyme in the mice is more active than in the naked mole rats. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Further observation found that the incidence of spontaneous tumors in these transgenic mice was significantly reduced, and they were significantly resistant to artificially induced tumors. Regardless of whether they are transgenic mice or non-transgenic control mice, they all age naturally, and most of them eventually die of tumors. Among them, the tumor incidence rate of control mice was 70%, while that of transgenic mice was only 57%. When the mice lived for more than 27 months, the anti-tumor properties of transgenic mice were more significant, and their spontaneous tumor incidence rate was only 49%, while In control mice, it was as high as 83%. When the researchers induced skin papillomas in mice, the incidence of papillomas in the transgenic mice was also much lower than that in the control mice, indicating that the transgenic mice were also significantly resistant to artificially induced tumors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even more surprisingly, the transgenic mice also showed extended lifespan and improved health. Relative to control mice, the median lifespan of transgenic mice increased by 4.4%, while the maximum lifespan increased by 12.2%. At the same time, the researchers also conducted a physical examination on the mice participating in the experiment and found that the overall health of the transgenic mice was significantly better than that of the control mice. Especially during the aging process, the inflammation in most organs of transgenic mice was significantly less than that of control mice, and inflammation is an important indicator of organ aging, and the intestinal health of transgenic mice was also significantly improved. Further analysis found that the high molecular weight hyaluronic acid possessed by transgenic mice can reduce inflammatory responses through multiple pathways, including direct immunomodulatory effects on immune cells, protection from oxidative stress, and improvement of intestinal barrier function during aging. etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This research lays the foundation for the application of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid in human clinical trials, and also brings new hope for the development of anti-cancer and life-extending drugs or treatments. On August 23, 2023, the research team of Professors Gerbunova and Professor Seluanruf published the results of this research on the website of &quot;Nature&quot; magazine. It took a full 10 years from the discovery of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid in naked mole rats to proving that it can improve the health of mammals, which reflects the difficulty of basic research and also reflects the efforts of Professor Gerbunova and Serouanlu. This is the reward for the long-term efforts of Professor Hu’s research team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Next, the team also plans to conduct human clinical trials, hoping to achieve the goals of both anti-cancer and extending lifespan by increasing the synthesis of high-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid in the body or slowing down its degradation. The miraculous anti-cancer and life-extending benefits of the body are brought to humans, opening up a new way for human health and longevity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中国人寿保险（集团）公司原董事长王滨一审被判死缓]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256536]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-13 10:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/12/93c908a94264080cab76402e2672ddba.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;3909&quot; height=&quot;2827&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/09/12/93c908a94264080cab76402e2672ddba.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;250449&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 12, 2023, the Intermediate People&#39;s Court of Jinan City, Shandong Province publicly pronounced the verdict of the former Party Committee of China Life Insurance (Group) Company In the case of Secretary and Chairman Wang Bin accepting bribes and concealing overseas deposits, the defendant Wang Bin was sentenced to death for accepting bribes, with a two-year suspended execution, deprived of political rights for life, and all personal property was confiscated, and his death penalty was suspended for two years.

On September 7, parents in Suiping County, Zhumadian, Henan Province broke the news that a primary school teacher posted a message about students ordering milk. A screenshot of the chat in the online post showed that a teacher sent a message saying that if a child cannot drink school milk due to a certain disease, Parents need to provide proof of diagnosis and treatment from a county hospital or above medical institution.这位老师还表示，全班共53名学生，其中已有15人完成征订，希望剩下38名学生的家长“积极配合工作”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这则消息一经曝光就引发了一波舆情。老师的言辞存在“强制订奶”的嫌疑，多少显得“吃相难看”，“强买强卖”的作风也引发了网友的质疑与嘲讽，唤醒了大家“订牛奶” “订教辅资料”“订指定图书”的“童年记忆”。尤其是“除非自证有病，否则必须订奶”“您期望老师能对53个孩子一视同仁”的措辞，甚至还不无威胁之意，招致舆论的如潮恶评。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;遂平县有关部门9月8日对外表示，县教育局已于7日调查清楚，此事系遂平县沈寨镇中心小学某班主任的“个人行为”，“开医疗证明”也是这位老师个人的不当表述。同时，只有这个班强制要求了，其他班都是自愿订购。目前县教育局已对这名老师进行了批评教育，并要求老师向家长道歉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这并不是驻马店近期唯一一起“订奶事件”。 9月7日正阳县有家长爆料称，一小学老师称“有条件积极订购，没条件创造条件订购”，从网传微信群截图来看，这名老师在微信群里发布了“牛奶人人都要订！”的信息，并表示“考虑到家长们的经济压力”，每学期的“订奶指标”从原先的“全份4箱440元”变成“学校商议”后的“每人只订3箱共计330元”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;9月8日该校校长称，订购牛奶是遵循自愿原则，老师措辞不对，将重新开会研究；当地教育局一工作人员则称，上级部门为了学生健康成长要求订购牛奶，但遵循家长自愿原则；教育局9月8日在情况通报中则称，网友反映问题基本属实，该班对上级文件精神解读出现偏差，涉嫌违背自愿征订原则，因此将立即暂停饮用奶宣传征订工作，对其进行整顿规范，调查处理相关责任人员。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;几乎在同一时间，驻马店出现了两起老师强制学生订奶的“个人行为”。纵观两起事件的时间线，可以说是大同小异；后来走向也是如此，“强制订奶”被认为是老师的“个人行为”，同时坚持学生饮用奶征订工作遵循了自愿原则。但细审这两起事件，仍有一些疑问有待辨析与追问。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其一，老师要求学生订奶时，真的是他们的“个人行为”吗？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;两起事件曝光的截图里，正阳县老师提到“经学校商议”，正阳县教育局在情况通报中明言这是对“上级文件”的“解读偏差”。如果没有这些“文件”压下来，区区小学老师有何动机化身推销员，有何必要向诸多家长发出“没条件创造条件” “没病就得订奶”这种影影绰绰的威逼利诱之语？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在两起事件中，如果老师冒着曲解上级文件的风险也要干出如此让家长举报的事情，背后图什么？如果没有利益动机支撑的话，“个人行为”的说辞显然就更难成立。在“上级文件”与“自愿原则”之间存在冲突的情况下，老师要如何把握“个人行为”，才能同时让上级与家长都满意？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，教育部门有必要公布当初下发的“上级文件”原文，或是向社会公布征订牛奶这项“工程”的具体指令究竟是怎样的，这样才能更清楚。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其二，两起“强制订奶”事件也显示，基层教师在平常工作中承担了太多的非教学负担，这才是诸多类似事件的一大根源。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在现行教育体制下，老师作为实际上的基层人员、权力链条上的末梢，颇有一种“权小责大”的尴尬：这个“责”是对上负责，而不是向家长与学生负责；“上级部门”负责下指令、发通知，然而却在实际中“权大责小”，拥有极大权力的同时并不对学生负责。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;长期以来，基层教师承担了太多不属于教学的额外任务。左手钉钉群，右手微信群，今天打卡，明天回执，这边文艺汇演，那边教材征订，导致相当多的时间精力都被非教学任务占据，严重影响了教书育人的分内之事。甚至于，基层教师往往还要将自上而下的压力传导到家长那里。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以这两起事件为例，姑且不论学生饮用奶征订本身是否合理，这项工作本来也不应该交给老师来做。教育系统的行政人员为数不少，由他们这些专人来负责照看学生的健康、选取更好的奶制品，无疑会是比凭空加给老师一项无关职责要好得多。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中小学教师理应从被强加的非教育负担中解脱出来，集中心神教书育人，更好地为学生而不是为上级服务，否则不出事就让老师干各种各样与教学无关的事儿，一出事就是“老师个人行为”，这也太欺负人了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“骂醒恋爱脑”服务：当情感变成生意，爱真的能骂醒吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256554]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-13 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/12/yVwqc8dgVtJ4PixgRy7l4nenvljJ6IFmUtgobDkg.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2012年播出的电视剧《薛平贵与王宝钏》近来被网友重新解读，剧情中，王宝钏等薛平贵十八年，以野菜充饥，被称为“恋爱脑鼻祖”。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（资料图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“来，想怎么骂？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刚和南方周末记者加上好友，Z在聊天框中发来消息。确认了“可以直接一点”和“不要带脏字”的要求后，连性别都没问清，Z就开始连番输出：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“她都不爱你你爱她个什么劲，别人都不想理你，你还巴巴地当ATM机？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;紧跟着是一张阴阳怪气的表情包，然后礼貌地询问：“听得进去么，不行我就换一种。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在南方周末记者告知自己的性别并给出否定答案后，Z才问起具体的情况。在这个聊天世界中，南方周末记者是一个为了男友放弃考研的“恋爱脑”，如今深陷在“被分手”的痛苦之中，渴求被“骂醒”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“这不分，留着干吗，送钱给他谈恋爱？”听完这个“故事”，Z极力劝分，并发起一连串质问：“为什么想不明白，为什么还期待，你凭什么要对他期待，他很帅？很有钱？会对你温柔？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;花钱找骂，这个行为听起来似乎有些不可思议。七夕前后，这项被称作“骂醒恋爱脑”的服务在电商平台上成为一门红火的生意，随后流行至小红书、抖音等社交平台，许多用户自行接单，收费开骂。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/12/oSiDa9OXFh1Jmf8pKRUukJzleIavaabhqJpB2R2h.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;767&quot; height=&quot;1695&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/12/oSiDa9OXFh1Jmf8pKRUukJzleIavaabhqJpB2R2h.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;最初造出“恋爱脑”这个词的人或许没有预料到，经过无数解读、扩散，这个标签可能让部分本就处在感情挣扎中的人更加煎熬，加剧了他们的自我否定，连向身边人宣之于口都成为难题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不久前，随着电影《消失的她》上映和电视剧《我的人间烟火》开播，主人公的一系列“恋爱脑”行径引起观众的踊跃讨论。如今，“反对恋爱脑”从口头演化为一门生意，许多深陷泥淖中的人探出手，渴求某个陌生人将自己拉出。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在淘宝上搜索“骂醒恋爱脑”，可以找到许多提供服务的店家。一家销量上万的淘宝店里，不同级别的陪聊师对应着不同的价格。南方周末记者选定了只能指定性别的“盲盒”，被分配了女陪聊师Z。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Z用微信文字或语音提供服务，收费15元20分钟，她的头像是一位漂亮的女网红，朋友圈看上去很生活化，分享着她的心情感想。在这场短暂的聊天里，Z留下箴言：“收起你的眼泪，没人会喜欢喜欢哭的女孩子，他也不会因为你哭心疼。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当南方周末记者表达了走不出来的痛苦后，Z劝说“你给他加滤镜”“有病”，随即提醒时间到了。Z从添加好友的那一刻就开始了计时，丝毫不顾对话是从五分钟后才真正开始的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“你可以的，相信我。我之前聊的恋爱脑都说可以的。”15元的服务戛然而止。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;主动下单，“恋爱脑”&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;清&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;醒了一半&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在店主李雨提供的价格表上，“消除恋爱脑”几个大字在粉红色的背景上十分醒目，底下一行小字写着：“情感大神在线指导”。价格表显示，“恋爱脑”被分为轻、中、重三个等级，顾客可以根据自身程度进行选择。陪聊师的服务时间从15分钟至1小时不等，价格在20元至180元之间。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李雨26岁，高中毕业后，从事游戏陪玩，管理着所在公会旗下的陪玩和陪聊师。后来公会解散，她发现做陪聊大有市场，2021年底开起了淘宝店，提供闲聊和情感咨询服务。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;七夕前后，“骂醒恋爱脑”的新闻引起了她的注意。据报道说，这项服务能月入几万元，李雨嗅到商机，把原本就有的情感咨询服务换了个名头，挂出“骂醒恋爱脑”的新业务。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;正式开展服务前，李雨特地去其他店铺下单体验。她下了两单，一个陪聊师在她还没说完自己的故事时，就开始骂她“太傻了”，李雨觉得情商太低，第一反应就想给差评；另一个几乎只是闲聊，没有帮忙分析。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;基于这些体验，李雨叮嘱自家店里的客服，要尽量派单给情感咨询经验丰富的陪聊师，他们上手快。另外也提醒陪聊师们注意情商，虽然叫“骂醒”服务，但也得小心态度，除非客户自己要求直白和强硬。总的来说，李雨总结，它是一类“比较强势的情感咨询”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;小陆是最早一批开展“骂醒恋爱脑”的店主之一。4月，抖音上开始流行情感劝说类的短视频，通常配上煽情的音乐，博主们语气激动，发起连番质问：“自作多情就是自取其辱”“不主动就是不喜欢”“吊着你就是差点意思”。小陆受到启发，尝试开发“骂醒恋爱脑”服务。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他店里的陪聊师背景各异，有全职妈妈、企业HR，也有专业心理工作者，他让他们看抖音视频学习“骂醒”技巧。在这一行，陪聊师的音色很重要，小陆更看重情商和阅历，年龄大一点、有阅历的，聊天通常不会太差。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;多位受访店主否认这项服务能月入几万。最多的时候，孟由的淘宝店每天能接到四五十个“骂醒恋爱脑”订单，最高峰一天收入几千块钱，但只持续了几天。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实上，很多做“骂醒恋爱脑”的店家是从陪聊业务衍生而来，由原先的陪聊师提供服务。孟由号称店里有约600位陪聊师，多数是兼职，男女比例约为2∶8。孟由店铺的陪聊师分为盲盒、金牌、镇店、男女神、首席、锦鲤六个等级，按照接单的频率、学历、客户喜爱度等条件排列。等级越高，收费就越高。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据孟由观察，下单“骂醒恋爱脑”的顾客里，女性超过90%。顾客的年龄大多在18-28岁，约一半是自己感情有问题，另一半是给朋友代点的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在孟由看来，顾客能主动来下单的，“恋爱脑”已经算清醒了一半，“不清醒的人不会点，他不想被骂醒。”孟由对南方周末记者说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/12/5obPocoVwyvkU5ZkT3eHNwqz91VDdxsv7uqhOk9B.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;“骂醒恋爱脑”在电商平台上成了一门红火的生意，有店主表示，最高峰时日入几千元。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（资料图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“不管有没有效果，他说出来了”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;刚开展“骂醒恋爱脑”服务时，李雨尝试亲自接了一次单。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;客户是一个女孩，她发现伴侣一直在其他社交软件上和别人聊天，两人分手后，她一直走不出来。李雨听完后，没有骂她，她觉得对方已经很难受了，“没必要去攻击人家”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李雨用直白的态度帮忙分析：女孩的伴侣就是喜欢到处聊天，如果女孩能接受，就去挽留他继续在一起；如果不能，那就好好爱自己。女孩没有当场给出答案，说要回去思考一下。后来，女孩找到店铺客服，给李雨留下一笔打赏。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陪聊师夏琳有一副偏中性的沉稳嗓音，她是在读博士，表达很有逻辑。生活里，她擅长给朋友提供建议，处理情绪问题，兼职做陪聊已经三个多月。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她自认“剥离感”非常强，“骂醒恋爱脑”时，虽然能为顾客共情，但她更习惯理性分析，“我要做的就是帮你解决问题”。李雨也强调，说，不能光骂，要围绕对方的处境，也不能一上来就强势地给出建议，至少要听完他们的故事。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;夏琳一般会首先了解客户的基本情况，让对方倾诉。“如果这个女生或男生有想倾诉的东西的话，不需要你引导他，他自己就恨不得说两小时。”夏琳说，引导对方把细节说清楚很重要，有利于帮忙分析。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她接过一个订单，一个男生网恋了一年，没和对方见过面便已谈婚论嫁，分手后才意识到被骗。他几乎每天都下单找夏琳。夏琳劝他不要跟自己较劲，虽然对方在相处过程中有欺骗行为，但没有骗他钱财，也提供了很多情绪价值，希望能让他稍微释怀一些。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“坦白讲好多人愿意听真话，不见得是想来听假话的。”夏琳对南方周末记者说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陪聊师陈晴从1月开始从事陪聊，一开始听到“骂醒恋爱脑”的顾客说自己的故事，她的情绪也会受影响，有时实在“劝不动”，她觉得有些无力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随着接的单子越来越多，她慢慢看淡了，“那是他们的人生，他们的生活与我无关，我只是一个旁观者，所以再无力我也不能去帮他们做任何事情。那是他们的生活、选择以及态度。”陈晴说，“那是他的人生，你为什么要插手？跟他说你一定要分手，万一错了，这个责任你也承担不了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在小陆看来，“骂醒恋爱脑”其实只是提供了辅助作用，很多下单者只是想找人倾诉，宣泄心里的情绪。“其实就是进行一个吐露。”他说，“不管有没有效果，他说出来了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;接单时间长了，夏琳发现，大部分案例大同小异。“共性是可能都有执念，都受过情绪伤害、精神控制、PUA，可能都有，又不肯放弃。”她说，“想和做是两码事，情绪这些是你摆脱不了的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;夏琳曾接过一个案例，一个四十岁的女性喜欢上一位年过七旬的已婚男性，长达几年无法抽身。夏琳感觉到，对方不打算放弃，因此她也不要求对方放弃。“尊重个体的感情，她有她自己的选择，她是成年人。”她说，“她只要同自己和解就好了，她没必要对任何人负责。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在夏琳看来，分析大道理是没有用的，“大道理能不知道吗？”一位顾客曾对她说，找了这么多人，夏琳是唯一能站在他立场上考虑的人。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“该恋爱脑的时候也是恋爱脑”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;李雨做了五年陪聊，听闻过许多别人的感情故事，自认在感情中还算聪明和谨慎。但她也不是从来如此，“该恋爱脑的时候也是恋爱脑的”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她的上一段感情，按她的话来说，“就是已经没有智商了”。在那段异国恋中，还在暧昧期时，对方曾经突然消失了两个月。那段时间，她经常打对方电话，但电话那头不挂断也不接起。朋友们劝她，这是遇到欺骗感情的“渣男”了，她无法相信。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;某次，对方终于接起电话，面对李雨的质问，他解释自己正在放假旅行，知道李雨一直尝试联系自己，但“就是不知道回什么”。李雨相信和原谅他的“消失”后，他们正式在一起。几个月后男生回国，李雨发现，他另有女朋友。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于下单“骂醒恋爱脑”的人，李雨感同身受。她知道，这个走出来的过程“会很难过”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在她看来，感情的问题很难用理性去控制，“我觉得每一个人都是恋爱脑，在一段感情里面，没有一个人那么理智的，感性就会有恋爱脑的倾向。”李雨告诉南方周末记者。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;分手后，李雨很长一段时间走不出来。和朋友们聊起，她故作潇洒，不敢坦白自己的痛苦。因为朋友们早已劝过她多次，“劝无可劝”，可能会认定她活该。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李雨只能在网上点单请人“骂醒”自己，她不敢找自己店里的陪聊师，他们都认识自己，“这个脸不能丢在自己家里，要丢得找一些陌生人丢”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李雨告诉陌生的接单陪聊师，如果觉得她的行为很傻或有其他感受，可以直接说出真实想法，不用太担心伤到她。一些陪聊师直接骂她笨，“世界上男人那么多，为什么要吊在一棵树上”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;听完这些，李雨内心很撕裂，这些道理其实她很清楚，但就是无法走出来。只是挨骂的时候，她可以暂时平静下来。她反反复复下单了很多次。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;周宁宁分手不久，试过在抖音上找人“骂醒”自己。她觉得前任不太喜欢自己，但还是很想挽留他。陪聊师分析了前任的种种不好，她一瞬间也觉得自己“有病”，居然会放下尊严去挽留对方。但没几天后，她还是忍不住又给前任发了挽留信息。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“这是一个阶段的东西，不是说一次两次就可以解决了。”李雨说，可能顾客当时想通了，但之后又“走到感情的深坑里面”，或许会有很多次反复，都是正常的，“骂醒”服务无法一劳永逸。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;说出来也许只是第一步。在李雨看来，走出恋爱脑更重要的还是要靠自己，她花了半年时间，才真正走出来。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“一个人动心了之后，想脱离这段感情是需要时间的，时间是必需品。”李雨告诉南方周末记者。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;当地时间2023年7月28日，日本防卫相滨田靖一在内阁会议上发布了2023年版《防卫白皮书》。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（视觉中国/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在福岛核污染水排海阴影之下，日本政府提出了史上最高额度的防卫预算。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据日本《每日新闻》2023年9月5日报道，日本财务省当天公布了政府各部门2024财年预算申请金额，其中，日本防卫省提交的2024财年预算申请超过7.7万亿日元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与上一年度6.82万亿日元相比，新的防卫预算一举增加了近1万亿日元，增幅达13.5%，创下二战以来的最高历史纪录。至此，日本防卫预算已连续12年增长。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是日本落实“防卫预算翻倍”的步骤之一，也使得岸田文雄政府距离“5年防卫支出总额达到43万亿日元”的目标更近了一步。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“早在安倍政府执政期间，日本就一直谋求甩掉二战&#39;战败国&#39;帽子，突破&#39;战后体制&#39;对其发展军事力量的约束，成为真正意义上的&#39;政治军事大国&#39;。”在中国国际问题研究院亚太研究所副研究员孙文竹看来，日本防卫预算大幅度增加并不让人意外，“鉴于自民党在日本国会占据多数，该预算通过审议的概率很大。而在未来几年，如果政坛不发生大的变化，日本防卫预算都将持续保持高增长态势。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“对标北约”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;近些年来，日本经济发展低迷，但防卫预算却节节攀升。如果此次预算通过，日本防卫开支将创下自2013年以来的“12连涨”纪录。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从上世纪60年代开始，日本防卫支出一直保持在GDP比重的1%以下。情况从2016财年开始出现变化，当年日本防卫预算突破5万亿日元。在接下来的7年时间，日本防卫费申请额接连“破6”“破7”，且间隔年限不断缩短。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;分析人士指出，在整军扩武的道路上，日本政府已经从“小步快跑”转向“大步狂奔”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年，日本防卫费首次突破“GDP1%框架”，成为标志性事件。然而，日本的野心并不满足于此。按照岸田文雄政府的规划，日本不仅要突破“红线”，还要实现“倍增”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年12月，日本正式通过新版《国家安全保障战略》《国家防卫战略》和《防卫力量整备计划》三份安保政策文件，明确提出加紧打造“防区外防卫能力”，将未来五年的防卫费总额增加至约43万亿日元，达到国内生产总值的约2％。需要划重点的是，2%这个数字，正是美国向北约成员国提出的要求。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“防卫费逐年增长，本质上体现出日本的防卫政策与国家战略，已经严重偏离战后奉行的&#39;和平路线&#39;。”孙文竹指出，日本军力建设已明显“由守转攻”，并不断强化与美国捆绑，试图重新实现自己“能攻能守”的军事大国野心。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;防卫预算对标北约，只是日本积极向以美国为首的北约靠拢的冰山一角。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;岸田文雄就任首相以来，日本和北约持续深化合作机制，双方高层频繁互动。北约秘书长斯托尔滕贝格毫不掩饰地称，没有哪个亚洲伙伴比日本离北约更近了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了合作机制上深度勾连，双方还不断把合作重点转向军事安全领域。2022年，日本陆海空三大自卫队相继赴北约参加军演。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“日本有意通过追随美国以&#39;集团政治&#39;维护自身霸权的战略思路，进一步强军扩武。”孙文竹说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但在经济低迷、通胀高企、日元贬值、物价飞涨等一系列严峻挑战之下，不断攀升的防卫费用将成为日本经济难以承受之重。据《日本时报》报道，为支付不断扩大的防卫成本，日本政府或将考虑出售持有的日本最大几家公司的股份，但这很难在内部达成共识。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;美国战略优先？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;日本创纪录的防卫预算，囊括了海军战舰、F-35战斗机和装甲车采购以及新型高超音速拦截导弹开发等“一揽子计划”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“日本防卫预算增加，既有构筑强有力防御体系的意图，也凸显出军事战略向进攻性加速发展的野心。”军事问题专家张学峰告诉南方周末记者，这根本上源于日本“政治大国化”的诉求，同时还有配合美国在西太平洋部署的战略需要。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年7月，日本发布新版《防卫白皮书》，继续重申要拥有“反击能力”，并将“防区外防卫能力”和“联合防空反导能力”列为日本自卫队未来五年需要全面发展的前两大能力。相关要求在2024财年防卫预算中均得到体现。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;日本敲定投入约3800亿日元，用于建造2艘“宙斯盾系统搭载舰”。这两艘搭载舰长190米，宽25米，标准排水量12000吨，将会成为“日本战后最大水面作战舰艇”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“&#39;宙斯盾系统搭载舰&#39;不是一个单纯的防御平台，搭载&#39;12式岸舰导弹二阶段改进型&#39;以及&#39;战斧&#39;巡航导弹后，具备强大的海上作战能力。”张学峰分析，这实际上是日本打着“弹道导弹防御舰”的幌子，建造攻防兼备的巡洋舰。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在构筑反导盾牌的同时，日本还多管齐下提升防区外打击能力。据美国《防务邮报》报道，日本计划将约7500亿日元用于增强国家的“防区外”作战能力，主要涉及开发和采购能够在敌方火力射程之外发射的导弹，包括“12式岸舰导弹二阶段改进型”、贾斯姆AGM-158联合防区外空地导弹等。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“日本这些举措是为了落实&#39;新安保三文件&#39;中拥有&#39;反击能力&#39;的目标，进而补齐自身在进攻领域的短板。”孙文竹表示。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但事实上，部署中远程导弹并延长既有导弹射程，不仅是日本“反击能力”所需，而且是美国急于在第一岛链打造的“导弹链”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年2月，美国与日方接触，计划在日本部署中程导弹，大大增强从第一岛链发起进攻的能力。日本产经新闻称，计划部署的导弹可能是美军正在开发的“远程高超音速武器”（LRHW）或“战斧”巡航导弹。加上日本为增强“反击能力”计划部署的导弹，美日或可联手打造一个“中程导弹网络”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如今，美国的如意算盘正在一步步实现。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;8月28日，美国国务院批准对日出售“贾斯姆”导弹，价值预计为152亿日元。而早在2023年度防卫预算中，日本就专门拨出2113亿日元，用于采购400枚美制“战斧”巡航导弹。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“&#39;战斧&#39;巡航导弹射程只有约1600公里，如果部署在第二岛链，就会出现射程不足的问题，所以美国一直想要在第一岛链进行部署。”张学峰指出，铁了心跟随美国的日本自然是最佳选择。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“在日本看来，日美同盟是日本安全的绝对基轴，其自身安全与美国维持在西太平洋的霸权是不可分开的。”孙文竹认为，相关举措就是要维持美国的相对军事优势。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;各有盘算&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;岸田文雄提出将日本防卫预算增加一倍后，2023年1月，美国国务卿布林肯在新闻发布会上公开点赞，并称“日本的战略与我们自己的国家安全战略休戚相关”。美国总统拜登甚至在演讲中说，“是我说服”岸田文雄增加防卫费用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实上，在日本公布的防卫费用“一揽子计划”中，美国是主要受益者之一。在2024财年防卫预算中，日本不仅将大量采购美制器装备，还计划与其共同开发“极超音速武器”新型拦截导弹。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“向日本出售武器，可以让美国军工企业赚取丰厚利润，但更为关键的是，日本军事实力不断增强，更有能力成为美国&#39;印太战略&#39;的&#39;马前卒&#39;。”张学峰说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年底，美军决定从日本嘉手纳空军基地撤出全部两个中队的F-15C/D战斗机，驻日美军空军战斗机力量直接缩减一半。美方给出的理由是战机老旧退役，但美国《星条旗报》称，美国空军撤离F-15战斗机的原因是因为“它们在第一岛链无法躲过中国的打击”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“在防御难度不断加大的情况下，美国希望日本持续增强军事实力，发挥更多作用，减轻其在第一岛链上的军事压力。”张学峰分析。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而日本，也在积极融入美国的“集团政治”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年7月，岸田文雄不顾国内民众反对，再度出席北约峰会，为北约在东京开设联络处提供便利。刚刚过去的8月，美国总统拜登、韩国总统尹锡悦与岸田文雄在戴维营举行首脑会晤。美联社称，三方签署的戴维营协议巩固了“亚太小北约”，加深了美日韩安全和经济联系。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“日本深知，推进&#39;军事大国化&#39;和&#39;正常国家化&#39;，都必须得到美国的认可和支持，因而必须将自己打扮成美国维护所谓&#39;自由开放国际秩序&#39;的&#39;得力助手&#39;甚至&#39;平等伙伴&#39;，以换取西方国家认可其在安全领域的地位和影响。”孙文竹表示。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但日本同时也有自己的小心思。在2024财年防卫预算中，日本防卫省列入逾500亿日元预算，用于开发新型国产导弹。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;孙文竹指出，美国退出“中导条约”后，一度有意把导弹部署到日本，但日本并不愿意被动接受，而是希望主开发或者购买中远程导弹。“一旦危机爆发，日本还可以根据实际情况和自身利益，保留一些回旋余地。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从更长远来看，日本的最终目标是尽量摆脱美国控制，夺回自主权。“如果美国放松对日本的警惕，放任其军事扩张，最终很可能会出现脱离掌控的局面，这对美国而言未必是一件好事。”张学峰指出。&lt;/p>;
