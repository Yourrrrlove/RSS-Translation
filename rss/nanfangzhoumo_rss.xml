The evaluation index system is now described in detail as follows:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/rB3LjY143PkCBOLBGAvB6nIqPDnWobGzOmO0ep0Z.jpg&quot; border= &quot;0&quot; width=&quot;498&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/rB3LjY143PkCBOLBGAvB6nIqPDnWobGzOmO0ep0Z.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250761 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;(1) Business scale and growth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Credit cards are an important tool for banks to establish long-term relationships with customers, and are also the focus of banks’ retail business. The scale and growth of the credit card business reflect the bank&#39;s customer acquisition capabilities and market position, while the number of credit card issuances and changes in the issuance volume reflect the bank&#39;s expansion effect, and the loan balance and proportion reflect the actual contribution of the bank&#39;s credit cards, the number of active accounts and transactions The amount reflects the marketing accuracy and stickiness of bank credit cards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;(2) Risk management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is very necessary to examine the risk management capabilities of bank credit cards. Credit cards are &quot;unsecured revolving loans&quot; issued by banks based on their trust in cardholders. The risk management capabilities of credit card business affect the bank&#39;s operating efficiency and competitiveness. Credit cards are an important source of income for banks, and their revenue comes from interest, fees and annual fees. If indicators such as the bad debt rate, fraud rate, and theft rate of credit cards cannot be effectively controlled, the bank&#39;s costs will increase and its profits will decrease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Affected by the epidemic, the non-performing loan ratio of commercial banks (including the non-performing ratio of credit card loans) will increase in 2022. At the same time, the measures to improve non-performing loan ratios disclosed in the annual reports of most listed banks are relatively general, and the measures taken by various banks lack comparability. In order to highlight the efforts and effects of banks in controlling the non-performing loan ratio, this evaluation system uses the credit card loan non-performing ratio indicator in 2022 and also sets a change rate indicator for the credit card loan non-performing ratio to directly reflect the achievements of the measures taken by each bank. Effectiveness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;(3) Customer service and product innovation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Competition in the credit card market is becoming increasingly fierce, and banks are constantly launching new products, services, functions and activities to meet the diverse needs of customers and improve customer stickiness. This evaluation system evaluates from both the bank side and the consumer side. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We use the types of credit cards issued by banks and the number of complaints about credit card business as positive and negative indicators respectively. On the consumer side, evaluations from third-party organizations are used, because third-party organizations obtain consumers’ evaluations of credit card products through a large number of objective questionnaires, which are more objective than those disclosed in bank annual reports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We select China Customer Satisfaction Index (C-CSI) and China Net Promoter Score (C-NPS) as consumers’ evaluation of credit card products. index. C-CSI and C-NPS survey targets permanent residents between the ages of 15 and 60, and are randomly sampled according to gender, age, income and region, and completed through household interviews. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We consider the card issuer’s distinctive credit card services of the year as bonus points. Each unique credit card service that is publicly disclosed and can be collected will receive 10 points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;(4) Reward and punishment mechanism for information disclosure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In our research, we found that most banks have disclosed data on each of the above indicators, but a few banks have not disclosed one or more indicators. In order to reduce the impact of information asymmetry and punish banks that do not disclose sufficient information, this evaluation system will give the lowest score to any indicator item that does not disclose relevant data. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;China Merchants Bank takes the lead&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Hua Xia is only better than city commercial banks&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;We will 19 The credit card businesses of commercial banks are ranked according to their scores, and the &quot;Credit Card Quality and Efficiency List&quot; is selected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Credit Card Quality and Efficiency Ranking&quot; shows that national commercial banks that started their credit card business earlier and have a large customer base rank high. But it does not mean that the larger the card issuance volume, the higher the overall score. As a joint-stock bank, although China Merchants Bank is not as large as the state-owned banks, it ranks first in the overall score of credit card business. This is due to its strategic vision of taking the lead in developing retail business and its innovation power that has been sustained for many years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/nrq2m73w7NwpA0YngHO0HozRPlvgzwOnrwyzdfu2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;864&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/nrq2m73w7NwpA0YngHO0HozRPlvgzwOnrwyzdfu2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250762&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Building Bank of China and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China closely followed China Merchants Bank in second and third place respectively. Among them, the total score of China Construction Bank&#39;s credit cards is only 20 points less than that of China Merchants Bank, with a very small gap. Three banks form the leading phalanx in the credit card business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the six major state-owned banks, the total score of Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China is far outside the top five. Not only are they far behind China Merchants Bank, but they are also surpassed by joint-stock banks such as CITIC, Ping An and China Guangdong Development Bank. Postal Savings Bank ranked thirteenth. Among joint-stock banks, Hua Xia Bank is at the bottom, with a score difference of 248 points from China Merchants Bank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/XPGZaas4gffibT9dkNVoXQWhd7gVkP1r0UbYHUiZ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;864&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/XPGZaas4gffibT9dkNVoXQWhd7gVkP1r0UbYHUiZ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250763&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Industrial and commercial The main reason why banks lose points with credit cards is that they only publish the total complaints but not the complaints of the credit card business. Therefore, when we do not consider the indicator of credit card business complaints, China Merchants Bank still leads the list, and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China overtook China Construction Bank and rose to second place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similarly, if the number of complaints is not taken into account, China Guangdong Development Bank and Bank of Communications leap to fourth and fifth place. This shows that the number of complaints from these two banks is relatively large. Of course, this does not rule out malicious complaints from gray products. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;State-owned banks and joint-stock banks are seriously divided&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;City commercial banks are catching up&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p >; Regardless of state-owned banks or joint-stock banks, the credit card scores of the two echelons are seriously divided in their respective camps. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the six major state-owned banks, only two and three are among the top five in the two lists, namely China Construction Bank, ICBC, China Construction Bank, ICBC and Bank of Communications. Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of China ranked low in both lists. Especially in the list excluding the number of complaints, Bank of China’s score has reached fourteenth place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among joint-stock banks, China Merchants Bank has always been far ahead. The overall performance of CITIC, Ping An and GF is remarkable. Among them, China CITIC Bank’s total credit card score is second only to China Merchants Bank among joint-stock banks. This is mainly due to the fact that the bank has received more scores than its peers in terms of consumer services and credit card business complaints. Among them, the score for credit card complaints is higher than that of other companies on the list. Bank and credit card categories also scored over 80, indicating that they cover a wide range of consumer groups. Although Guangdong Development Bank is smaller among all joint-stock banks, the overall score of Guangfa Credit Card is high among all banks. This reflects the important position of China Guangdong Development Bank&#39;s credit card business in the bank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The credit card scores of the four city commercial banks are at the bottom of the list, which shows that they still have a clear gap with large and medium-sized banks in terms of comprehensive credit card strength. Affected by factors such as their short time in the credit card market, small business scale and weak customer base, city commercial banks as a whole lag behind in indicators such as credit card issuance volume and credit card loan balance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, among city commercial banks, Bank of Jiangsu and Bank of Ningbo both scored 100 points for the credit card change volume indicator, especially Bank of Ningbo, which scored as high as 90 points for the proportion of complaints in the credit card business. This reflects that leading city commercial banks are working hard to catch up in the credit card business and have made great progress in some indicators. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Assistant researcher Liang Chenghao, Zou Huan and Yang Chaoqun also contributed)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt; hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[父亲殴打猥亵女儿者，检察机关不予起诉：义愤彰显人性，震慑奸宄之徒丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256739]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-15 14:09:23&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A few days ago, a case published by the &quot;Procuratorial Daily&quot; made many netizens shout &quot;Yangjian News&quot; and &quot;very mentioning&quot; gas&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 9, 2021, Li learned that his 15-year-old daughter had been molested by Xie Moumou, the deputy dean of a certain vocational and technical college, and came to the school to beat Xie Moumou. Xie&#39;s injury was assessed as minor injury level two. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The procuratorial organ believed that although Li&#39;s act of injuring Xie was suspected of intentional injury, it was an act of injury carried out out of anger in the process of claiming his daughter&#39;s legitimate rights and interests from the school. Because Li was a first-time offender and an occasional offender, his behavior was justified and the circumstances were minor, and he had lenient and lenient punishment circumstances such as surrendering, so the decision was made not to prosecute. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for Xie Moumou, after the procuratorate initiated a public prosecution, the court sentenced him to two years and two months in prison for the crime of forced indecency, prohibiting him from engaging in sexual relations with minors from the date of completion of the sentence or the date of parole. Occupations with special responsibilities such as education, training, and nursing that are in close contact with people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Among netizens’ reactions, no one complained about his father Li’s beating of Xie to a minor injury, let alone treating it as “intentional injury.” Instead, there were various “beatings” &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;It&#39;s not an exaggeration to beat him to death&quot;. Does such a sound sound &quot;tyrannical&quot;? not at all. This is the manifestation of the &quot;simple sense of justice&quot; or &quot;emotion of law&quot; inherent in every normal person&#39;s heart. Indignation makes us human, and integrity must mean knowing what to love and what to hate. Confucius said: Only benevolent people can love others and hate others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Netizens also had complimentary words for the local procuratorate, such as &quot;the light of justice&quot; and &quot;wanting to send a banner.&quot; If the law were applied mechanically, the father could be prosecuted and sentenced if he beat someone to a minor injury of the second degree. There are many cases like this in reality: one spouse cheats, the other catches the cheater in bed, and beats the lover wildly in anger. Then the lover goes to assess the injury. As long as the injury is minor, the other spouse will either pay for a settlement or be charged with intentional injury. Although it is legal to go to jail and let the attacker go to jail, it is against human ethics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, to some extent, the above cases reflect the conflict between natural law and statutory/statutory law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called natural law/natural rights simply means that laws are discovered, not invented or formulated, which is often referred to as &quot;natural law&quot;. From the perspective of evolutionary game theory, natural law is the embodiment of &quot;evolutionary stable strategy&quot; (ESS). Tit for retaliation, or what Confucius said, &quot;repay kindness with kindness, repay hatred with directness&quot; is ESS. Only in this way , can promote cooperation among members of society, suppress breach of trust and aggression, and enable society and civilization to survive. The final rule derived from &quot;reciprocity&quot; is that each other respects each other&#39;s life, freedom and property rights, as the Chinese say, &quot;Kill to pay for life, debt to pay for money.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Statutory law is made by people and will refer to natural law or customary law, but it is not always consistent with natural law or customary law, and sometimes even runs counter to it. In the fields of marriage, family and property inheritance, there are many cases Reflects the conflict between statutory law and natural law or customary law. The only daughter, Ms. Yang, wanted to inherit her parents&#39; inheritance, but found that 22 relatives of both parents also had the right to inherit (based on statutory law). Fortunately, these relatives did not think they had the right to inherit the inheritance of Ms. Yang&#39;s parents (based on natural law and common law). This is Heaven governs people&#39;s hearts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Back to the case where his father Li beat Xie. Xie obviously knew how to use legal weapons to protect himself. After being beaten, he immediately identified the injury as &quot;minor injury level two&quot;, which showed that he He also suffered injuries, using this as a bargaining chip, or wanting to offset the disadvantages he faced in the molestation case, because minor injuries can be administratively detained, and minor injuries can be sentenced to prison. The show is &quot;I go to jail, you also go to jail, let&#39;s go together.&quot; posture. Judging from the local procuratorate&#39;s handling of both cases, it is obvious that the police also completed the investigation into the beating case of his father Li and handed it over to the prosecutor. It can be inferred that Xie reported the case to the police after being beaten. Reporting the crime + injury assessment, the direction of counterattacking Li is very obvious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that the local procuratorate’s decision not to prosecute Li has resolved the conflict between natural law and statutory law in this incident. It is in accordance with the laws of nature and people’s hearts, and it is for the father Li to stand up for his daughter. The behavior and morality are very good, and it is also a good deterrent to those who try to extend their dirty hands to minors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How do individuals deal with conflicts between natural law and statutory law? My father, Li, is a good example. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different statutory provisions and different judgments based on them mean different behavioral incentives for people and will change people&#39;s behavior. For example, the case of Datong, Shanxi, where she was accused of rape after getting engaged, triggered strong concerns and debates. , one of the motives discussed by everyone is &quot;how to avoid legal risks&quot;, but generally speaking, when the rights of parents and children are violated, the emotions and temperament of blood thicker than water will prevail, at least they will be very angry, and often stand Come out, instead of blindly looking forward and backward, timid, and appearing particularly &quot;rational and calm&quot;. If a person does not show blood and courage at this time, then he probably does not have these things at all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every father and mother who stands up for their children is worthy of respect. When their children are hurt and most vulnerable and helpless, they stand up to confront the aggressor and expose the aggressor&#39;s evil deeds to the broad daylight. This is the best help and the best value for their children. educate. They let their children know that when they are hurt, their parents are their strongest backing and support; they must be as brave as their parents, dare to say no to infringements and infringers, and dare to advocate and defend their rights. If there are more parents like this, not only will those who are ready to make a move think twice about it, but they will also convey a strong and profound value system to the next generation and the whole society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国家卫健委：9月20日起将猴痘纳入乙类传染病进行管理]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256733]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-15 13:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;strong>;National Health Commission Announcement&lt;/ strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;According to the relevant provisions of the &quot;Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China on the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases&quot;, monkeypox will be included in the management of Class B infectious diseases from September 20, 2023.

In the past, it mainly occurred in Central and West Africa. Since May 2022, monkeypox epidemics have occurred in more than 100 countries and regions around the world. Epidemics in many countries have shown that monkeypox has been transmitted from person to person and has spread widely to countries and regions outside Africa, with a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%. In September 2022, my country reported its first imported case of monkeypox, and local monkeypox epidemics began to appear in June 2023. Currently, more than 20 provinces across the country have reported monkeypox cases, triggering new local secondary outbreaks and hidden transmission. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The National Health Commission and the State Administration for Disease Control and Prevention conscientiously implement the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, treat monkeypox as a new emerging infectious disease, and give full play to their multiple capabilities.
