Jennifer Lawrence, the &quot;eldest cousin&quot; who plays the heroine Katniss, has also become a smash star. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Although there are endless battle royale-themed dramas nowadays, back then, watching a group of young people fight each other in a reality show was undoubtedly a new thing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/4826dc0358aad5db1fb014754cae12a9.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/4826dc0358aad5db1fb014754cae12a9.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259108 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;The Hunger Games&quot; established a complete world view setting: Panem consists of a capital city and thirteen border areas.

Massacre is a TV show that the upper class watches. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eight years have passed since the completion of &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; series prequel - &quot;The Song of Songbirds and Snakes&quot;, in which the protagonist becomes the young President Snow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/7fd5250b4cb6c5a2adda60824ae5f6aa.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1634&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/7fd5250b4cb6c5a2adda60824ae5f6aa.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259110&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the main story, the elderly version of President Snow played by Donald Sutherland is calm and scheming. He is a ruthless ruler who has been committed to tripping up the heroine Katniss. In the end, they were unable to stop the revolutionary upsurge of the rebels. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/da6705ab7be9297cbb1a459e9fc0a7a6.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;861&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/da6705ab7be9297cbb1a459e9fc0a7a6.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259107 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;The Song of Songbirds and Snakes&quot; pulls the timeline back to 64 years ago and tells the story of young Snow&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; (played by Tom Bryce)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;’s history of blackness. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;As the mentor of the 10th Hunger Games, he has to deal with the tribute he is responsible for—Lucy, a girl from District 12&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; (played by Rachel Ziegler) &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Become a community with a shared future. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the game of &quot;both gain and lose&quot;, they gradually developed feelings for each other, but how far can young and fragile love go? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/6fa493ff4d2c11376e14d9bbe8f7c64d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/6fa493ff4d2c11376e14d9bbe8f7c64d.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259106 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After &quot;The Song of Songbirds and Snakes&quot; was released, Douban&lt;/span>; scored 7.1 points, but its reputation was mixed. Although it is titled &quot;The Hunger Games&quot;, it is a movie about people. It focuses on the exploration of characters and despises the design of the game. Therefore, it is less entertaining and critical than the true story, but more The thickness of a single character. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;——There are a few spoilers below, please read with caution if you mind——&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The best part of the whole film The point is that it completes the history of the slightly facial-looking villain President Snow in the main story. There is a saying: &quot;If you knew me before, you might forgive me now.&quot; If you know the young Snow, you may have a little more understanding of the old Snow. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The prequel did not whitewash Snow, but it did catalyze the audience&#39;s pity for him, especially under the performance of Tom Bryce, the 18-year-old Snow Appear handsome, proud and lovable. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/baf3f171b7660a5eb3dfa2f5f3ee1907.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1035&quot; height=&quot;436&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/baf3f171b7660a5eb3dfa2f5f3ee1907.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259109 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Snow is the son of a general in the capital, but after his father&#39;s early death, the family fell into a dilemma. He, his cousin and his grandmother depended on each other in an empty mansion, and their lives were stretched thin. Under the empty noble title. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The opening of the movie is an important day when the school awards scholarships. With excellent grades, he is bound to win. As long as he gets the money, he can go to college. But he can wear school uniforms on ordinary days, but not on important days. He lacks a piece of clothing that he can use. Fortunately, my cousin was very ingenious. She first treated the yellowed old shirt with a curtain bleaching agent, and then used small pieces of bathroom tiles to make new buttons. Snow, who goes out with his head held high, is as confident and arrogant as Scarlett who sews clothes with curtain cloth in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/92320b533d447c6d8c7ddbe810700e0f.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;451&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/92320b533d447c6d8c7ddbe810700e0f.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259111 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;He talked with his classmates from the aristocratic school and explained that he was sweating because the driver failed to take him to the school gate, and that he skipped tea and snacks because he had eaten steak early in the morning. (and threw away half of it), and together with his classmates from the old-money class, he despised the upstart classmates who moved to the capital from the second district. In just a few minutes, an image of a person who hides his inferiority with arrogance, is determined to win everything, and is accustomed to bluffing appears on the page. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Unfortunately, things did not go as smoothly as Snow had imagined. The rules of the scholarship were changed, and the talented people were assigned as mentors in the Hunger Games. Only those who led the tributes to win the game could receive them. scholarship. Due to personal grudges between his parents, Snow was assigned to a lesser tribute - Lucy, who seemed completely unlikely to win. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/472fb5140a0ad446ff37759721516cf0.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/472fb5140a0ad446ff37759721516cf0.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259113 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Snow is good at accepting facts, observing world affairs and perceiving people&#39;s hearts. He quickly formulated a battle plan: perform in front of the camera and use public opinion to build momentum as much as possible. We may still remember that in the main story of &quot;The Hunger Games&quot;, Katniss and Pete pretended to be a couple to gain support from the people of the capital. The essence of reality shows has always been &quot;show&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Snow personally&lt;/span>; picked up Lucy at the train station, gave her roses, held hands with her in the zoo cage, and gave her food supplies. Encourage her to sing for the camera. Lucy, who was born as a minstrel, is also well versed in the rules of performance and is good at using singing to express emotions and ridicule rules. They are a perfect partner in the true sense, so it is very natural to have a little illusion of love under the suspension bridge effect. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/799efcc36f7d301c4a587e684443f2f6.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;950&quot; height=&quot;633&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/799efcc36f7d301c4a587e684443f2f6.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259114 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;The Song of Songbirds and Snakes&quot; is divided into three chapters. The first two chapters focus on the Hunger Games themselves, but the end of Lucy&#39;s game is the beginning of Snow&#39;s game. , he faces the fate of his unscrupulous game. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;Snow always lands on &amp;nbsp;top&quot; (Snow/Snow always falls on top) is Snow&#39;s personal creed, and this motto also implies his It&#39;s his destiny, so he will deviate from the track for a while, but once he has the opportunity, he will definitely find a way to turn around. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/45eb4ec796af6d3bace886ead45e02d0.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;451&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/45eb4ec796af6d3bace886ead45e02d0.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259112 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It is not comprehensive enough to summarize &quot;The Song of Songbirds and Snakes&quot; as &quot;the history of Snow&#39;s transformation&quot;. The slogan on the title page of the novel &quot;From a handsome boy to a president, Snow The description of &quot;what a price was paid&quot; is also worthy of scrutiny. Judging from the information conveyed in the film, Snowburn is an ambitious, ruthless, paranoid, sensitive and powerful egoist. In the process of betraying his friends and abandoning his lover, he gradually tore off the mask of elegance and respectability, buried the compassion of the young man, and finally returned to his true self. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/d84e8f7ed303a2dcec5795c8f77bd148.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1036&quot; height=&quot;432&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/d84e8f7ed303a2dcec5795c8f77bd148.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259115 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The successful portrayal of Snow is the biggest highlight of &quot;The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes&quot;. His character arc in one movie even exceeds that of Kegnis in four movies. The latter is already a character carefully portrayed in commercial blockbusters. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Otherwise, however, &quot;Song of Songbirds and Snakes&quot; is lackluster. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Let’s talk about the controversial heroine first. New actress Rachel Ziegler is good at singing. She won the Golden Globe Award for &quot;West Side Story&quot; and is also a new version. The heroine of &quot;Snow White&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;In &quot;The Song of Songbirds and Snakes&quot;, she sang well, but her acting skills were &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;speak&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; barely watchable&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; , and the gap between her and the male protagonist in the affectionate scene is extremely obvious&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;It’s not that the audience &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; is harsh, but compared with Jennifer Lawrence, she does still have a long way to go. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/23d52c2f9a95d02fa380f7b0c909cbac.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;245&quot; height=&quot;130&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/23d52c2f9a95d02fa380f7b0c909cbac.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;259116 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/68fdf8e7c843b4f6df1bb52a55e95b42.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;545&quot; height=&quot;243&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/68fdf8e7c843b4f6df1bb52a55e95b42.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;259117&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;(The picture shows a comparison of the same action)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;About the game Setting, obviously the 74th Hunger Games depicted in the first part of the sequel is the best. Both the pre-game preparation and the actual combat are full of ingenuity, allowing the audience to feast their eyes on the visual spectacle. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The 10th Hunger Games in &quot;The Song of Songbirds and Snakes&quot; was quite simple. It was still an indoor game in a stadium, which made the action scenes that the series is proud of completely absent. No room for display. After watching the game, all I remember is that a group of tributes finished the game in a hurry, offering their heads one by one without any highlights. Audiences looking for the thrill of a battle royale game may be disappointed, because the movie is quite restrained in its presentation of spectacles such as killing and violence. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/86f56582524ffc2bd8dc4cc7acd95bc6.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;451&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/86f56582524ffc2bd8dc4cc7acd95bc6.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259118 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On the other hand, the reflections on reality shows and the discussion of revolution in the main trilogy are nowhere to be found in &quot;The Song of Songbirds and Snakes&quot;. This may be the filmmaker&#39;s strategy to avoid repeating itself, but it also blocks the possibility of the text digging deeper into derivatives. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/9a1b5b6d556ed3df4774259cc065da4c.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;449&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/9a1b5b6d556ed3df4774259cc065da4c.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259119 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Therefore, if you are looking for the critical and gaming experience of the &quot;Hunger Games&quot; series in the movie, you may be disappointed. But if you are interested in character stories, you can still watch it. &quot;Song of Songbirds and Snakes&quot; does have some subtle touches in this regard, which makes people suddenly moved by the foreshadowing of fate. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;span>;When old President Snow sees the rebellious girl Katniss from District 12 singing &quot;The Hanging Tree&quot;, will he think of his youth? His then lover Lucy also crooned for him? &lt;/span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;When the 18-year-old Snow was shooting wildly in the foggy and miasmatic forest, destroying the corpse of his love, he probably also He would never have imagined that this belated bullet would hit him directly between the eyebrows a few years later. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 22 Nov 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[离世四年，崔雪莉生前纪录片公开：被装进偶像模具的孤独灵魂]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261090]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-22 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot;To the Truth&quot; is a film based on A documentary based on an in-depth interview with Cui Xueli.

(Information picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Let me briefly introduce myself first.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A simple opening question was handed over from the other side. The answer to this question could be &quot;f(x)&#39;s Sulli&quot; or &quot;actress Choi Sulli&quot;. In front of the camera, senior artist Cui Sulli seemed a little unable to answer the question. She was silent and hesitated for about nine seconds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I am Cui Zhenli.&quot; His tone sounded calm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with &quot;Cui Zhenli&quot;, in the Korean cultural circle, Cui Zhenli has a more famous stage name &quot;Cui Shirley&quot;. What is bound to &quot;Cui Xueli&quot; is a sweet and pure face. In 2005, Choi Jin-ri became a contracted trainee with the Korean entertainment company SM. Four years later, she debuted as a member of the girl group f(x). Because her skin is fair and she loves to laugh, fans call her &quot;Peach in the World&quot; and &quot;Pocket Sister&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sulli Cui maintains a sweet image in front of the public. But she said that she is not a &quot;cute&quot; person and is far from the public&#39;s imagination of her as a &quot;pocket sister.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At a certain moment, she doubted everything. &quot;I do what others ask me to do, but I don&#39;t know the reason for doing it.&quot; She began to seemingly rebelliously talk about a relationship that was not recognized by fans and family members, uploading sexy photos on her personal social platform, and in terms of gender concepts Conservative South Korea publishes avant-garde female perspectives. What happened next is known: the torrent of bad reviews hit her brutally. On October 14, 2019, she committed suicide at home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 13, 2023, four years after Cui Shirley&#39;s death, Netflix released her posthumous work &quot;To the Truth&quot;. In this documentary, interviewers talk to her about her pain and weakness during those years, as well as her doubts and reflections about being in the star-making industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For each question, she remained silent and thinking for a long time. In &quot;To the Truth&quot;, she expresses the suppression of people by the entertainment industry. &quot;Do you know &quot;Nikita&quot;? It&#39;s like that movie. You can say that we are all puppets, who cares if we are tired?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Being a K-pop idol is the worst. &quot;In between interviews in the documentary, she bluntly said that people don&#39;t seem to think celebrities are people. &quot;When I first entered the entertainment industry, people kept telling me one thing, you are a product. I didn&#39;t think it was ridiculous at the time. You must be the most beautiful and first-class product facing the public.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;For a long time after her debut, Cui Xueli maintained a sweet and smiling public image.

(Visual China Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“The only thing I can control is self-blame and self-deprecation”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Before becoming the artist Choi Shirley, Choi Jin-jin was born in Busan, South Korea. Her parents divorced when she was 7 years old. The mother raised three children and was financially strapped, so she had to work hard to make a living in the labor market. When Cui Zhenli reached the age of going to school, her mother thought, &quot;Instead of sending her to kindergarten, it is better to send her to an (acting) academy.&quot; That was the starting point for the intersection between Cui Jinri&#39;s life and the entertainment industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cui Zhenli only has a vague impression of his father - a man who is always half-lying and watching TV, but he has a deep attachment to his mother. When she was a child, her mother was often not at home. &quot;It was my job to wait for my mother every day. I wanted to make a doll that was exactly like my mother.&quot; She said that the relationship between mother and daughter was like &quot;twins or doppelgangers.&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t like green. It&#39;s not my favorite color. One day I asked her (mother), what is your favorite color? She said green. I told everyone that I like green.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the art film &quot;4: Clean Island&quot; based on Shirley&#39;s personal experience, the mother is an image who died very early. She writes a &quot;4&quot; on the face of her young daughter with blood, and the daughter grows up alone. Big, living as a butcher of pigs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Why am I so unconfident in everything? I really think about the injuries I suffered when I was a child. Love. I left my father without doing anything wrong. I was afraid that if I did something wrong and caused trouble, even my mother would leave. So I always had no self and only agreed and listened to my mother&#39;s opinions.&quot; Cui Zhenli later Such revealing of inner thoughts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cui Zhenli became Cui Xueli because of a report. At that time, she was spotted by Lee Byung-hun, the director of &quot;Dae Jang Geum&quot;, and among more than a hundred young actors, she was selected to play the role of Princess Sun Hwa in &quot;The Rhyme of Sweet Potatoes&quot;. The reporter who came to interview felt that the name &quot;Truth&quot; had too strong a Christian connotation, so they discussed changing the name. Later, the report appeared in the newspapers, and Cui Zhenli became Cui Xueli. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is how Cui Xueli was noticed by SM Entertainment. In the fifth grade of elementary school, Cui Xueli left Busan and started life as a trainee at SM Entertainment in Seoul. A new life unfolded, and while she was excited, she also felt hidden worries: &quot;Do I really have to live separately from my family?&quot; &quot;Can I adapt here?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While living in the dormitory, she was actually very worried. It is difficult to fully take care of your own life. My mother later learned from the staff that Shirley’s hair often had a rancid smell at that time because she couldn’t wash her hair cleanly. Cui Shirley once said during her lifetime that she &quot;often had to look at people&#39;s looks in order to survive.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having just signed with SM, the company’s training goal for Cui Xueli is not a Korean idol, but an actor. At that time, Shirley had already made a name for herself in film and television productions such as &quot;The Sweet Potato Rhyme&quot;. She stayed in Seoul until she graduated from elementary school, and she suddenly grew to over 1.7 meters tall. This is an embarrassing height for a child actor. My body type is no longer suitable for being a child actor and playing teenage roles, and my mind and experience are not up to par. SM Entertainment, which made its fortune with idol groups, placed her on another track: becoming a member of a girl group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2009, Cui Shirley debuted as a member of the Korean girl group f(x). She quickly became popular among fans for her outstanding appearance. After transitioning from an actress to an idol, she faced another complete, precise and streamlined idol-starmaking industry. There is an unwritten underlying concept in the Korean entertainment industry. Actors have a higher level than idols, and actors have more autonomy, while idols must be cautious even in love. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an idol, Cui Xueli has a wary attitude towards fame, &quot;I understand what it means to be famous, but I am also very scared. I always feel that it is a bubble. So try not to look at it. Try to Turn around.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the age of 20, Cui Xueli endured everything that &quot;beautiful&quot; brought to her - the support of the crowd and the love of fans. Korean entertainment reporters commented on her appearance, saying that even if she is away from the team, she can still attract fans with her beauty. But she also felt trapped by her appearance. &quot;Every time someone complimented me on my beauty, I wanted to know why they said that... I felt that I had to be beautiful. I was even left out because my behavior was not beautiful enough.&quot; .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Truth, you seem to be under strict control and restraint. How do you cope with such great pressure?&quot; In the documentary &quot;To Truth&quot;, the interviewer asked a question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The only thing I have control over is blaming myself and putting myself down,” she replied. “The only time I feel like I have control is when I make myself miserable.”&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&quot;But that&#39;s too painful. There is a limit to people&#39;s ability to endure pain. Maybe the problem is in the industry itself, not necessarily your problem.&quot; The interviewer said, &quot;This may not be your fault.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;In front of the camera, Cui Xueli’s eyes suddenly became moist. She raised her head and said, &quot;No,&quot; pretending to be relaxed. Then she faced the camera, showed a standard smile, and asked, &quot;Can I laugh?&quot; She choked with sobs and said, &quot;I don&#39;t have this choice.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;She said that she has always been wearing a mask called &quot;being brave&quot; and often &quot;pretending to be okay&quot;. &quot;I always don&#39;t want to show that I am weak. I feel embarrassed. I often have such a sense of shame.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;During the interview, she said more than once that she &quot;screwed up&quot; the interview. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Sulli Cui starred in the personal reality show &quot;The Truth Store&quot;.

The first is to find herself a therapist, and the second is to date someone else. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of many people, the &quot;personality&quot; of Sulli that fans and the public bought into began to collapse after she fell in love. In the past, the outside world fixed her image as the girl next door. News of her relationship broke out that she was dating Cui Zi, a member of the hip-hop group Dynamicduo, who is 14 years older than her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The first love rumors are inherently very sensitive for idols. Who the first love rumors are about is really important. Everyone is concerned about Sulli’s first love &quot;The target.&quot; TVDaily reporter Kim Ji-hyun said in an MBC documentary, &quot;The problem is Choi Ja who is too different in age.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My mother, Kim Soo-jung, was firmly opposed to this relationship, and the mother and daughter even broke up because of it. No more contact. In Jin Xiujing&#39;s view, that was the starting point of the family&#39;s misfortune. &quot;Before the love rumors broke out, our family was happy. It has always been.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fans are also dissatisfied with this relationship. When the love affair broke out, it was during the golden period of f(x)&#39;s development, and love affects the development of the team. Some fans noticed in the live stage video that Cui Xueli sometimes did not dance properly, and suspected that she was &quot;paddling&quot;. Kim Soo-jung revealed that since then, her daughter has suffered from depression and panic disorder. &quot;The fans are cheering right in front of me, and there are good and bad words. You have to listen to these while performing on the stage.&quot; After Shirley passed away, Jin Xiujing returned to the empty house and discovered countless medicines that were far beyond the digestion capacity of ordinary people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Cui Xueli felt happy in this relationship, during their relationship, Cui Zi caused controversy due to the more explicit lyrics in the new song &quot;Eat, Sleep,&quot;. In 2015, Sulli officially quit f(x). In 2017, the two announced their breakup. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“(I) was hurt by others, and the whole person collapsed at that time. Because of these people, I can rely on someone. Hiding behind others, I can also feel positive energy. But I am very close to you. People close to me and people around me gradually left me. Because they are also cowardly people, they only take care of themselves. I also thought about asking for help, but they did not lend a hand at that time.&quot; Cui Shirley said that she had the feeling that &quot;a person is being The feeling of remaining in this world.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few years before her death, many of the contents Cui Shirley posted on social platforms were accused of being &quot;out of line.&quot; A video of squirting cream in the mouth was considered by netizens to have &quot;sexual connotations&quot;; a dinner party with friends and the embarrassment of being drunk was considered &quot;crazy&quot;; a photo of a party with close friends showed a group of men and women hugging happily, causing &quot; Doing drugs&quot; suspicion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every move she makes is noticed, and the media loves to create some eye-catching headlines. Every time there is a new trend, abusive comments flood into the news links. During a live broadcast, a friend read out a comment from an onlooker: I came to the live broadcast room just to see what strange things Cui Xueli did again. She is called &quot;Guan Zhong&quot; by many people, which means: someone who loves to show off her position to attract people&#39;s attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For young Cui Xueli, these turbulent malices and doubts are not easy to resist. In a video interview, Cui Xueli smiled and said to the camera as if begging for mercy: &quot;Viewers, please love me a little more, journalists, please love me a little more.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I really am not Bad guy,” she said on numerous occasions. &lt;p>; 》Stills.

(File picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Valuable Rebel&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2019, Cui Xueli&#39;s condition seemed to be better. After a long period of silence, she participated in &quot;The Truth Store&quot; and Variety shows such as &quot;Night of Bad Comments&quot; have more public schedules. In the same year, she released her first album &quot;Goblin&quot;. In June of that year, at a fan meeting to commemorate the release of her first solo album, she told the fans in the audience: &quot;I will live seriously.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Four months later, she lived alone He ended his life at home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the 2019 Korean variety show &quot;Night of Bad Comments&quot;, Cui Xueli, a pink-haired girl, responded one by one to the negative comments that netizens have put on her over the years. She talked about the &quot;no bra&quot; controversy that has been surrounding her, and naturally talked to the host about her understanding of underwear, &quot;underwear is like accessories.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“When I first posted the photo without underwear, a lot of people were talking about it. I was scared and could have hidden it, but I didn’t. The reason was that I wanted to change people’s perception of it &quot;I also want to say that it&#39;s not a big deal,&quot; she said. &quot;I think it&#39;s about personal freedom. Underwear is not good for health. They have underwires, which are not good for the digestive organs. I also have problems with my digestion.&quot; . It’s more comfortable not to wear them, so I won’t wear them.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Shirley’s death, some foreign media commented that she is in an industry that “encourages performers to remain silent off stage.” She exists as a valuable rebel. Another potential consensus regarding idols as commodities in South Korea is that idols should not talk about current affairs or comment on social events. But Cui Shirley chose to break it time and time again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Korean society where gender concepts are relatively conservative, many of her public expressions appear to be avant-garde. She said she wanted to get rid of &quot;menstrual shame&quot; and told the male host on a variety show that if you support equality between men and women, then you are a feminist. On April 11, 2019, South Korea abolished the crime of abortion, and she was one of the few female public figures to publicly express support. On Instagram that day, she posted: &quot;Today is such a glorious day, giving all women the right to choose.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Those things I do on social media are all done because I want to Do. My behavior and consciousness are fundamentally consistent with those who support feminism. The idea that women should not do that, speak loudly or have strong opinions is contrary to who I am as a person. I don’t like what they say. Men can talk openly about sex, their desires or dissatisfaction, and will be praised for being outspoken in these areas. But if women do the same, they will be regarded as vulgar and self-righteous, and they will be reprimanded.&quot; In the documentary &quot;For&quot; &quot;Truth&quot;, Cui Shirley responded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The fact that Shirley repeatedly did things that misogynists didn&#39;t like and refused to apologize is what really attracted her attention.&quot; After Shirley&#39;s death, Indiana University Korean Culture and Society Expert CedarBough Saeji said in an interview with CNN, &quot;It&#39;s incredible that society criticized her so harshly just because she showed her personality in a way that didn&#39;t fully conform to the norms of Korean society.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She Shortly before her death, a friend received a call from her. Friends recalled that Shirley&#39;s voice sounded worse than bad. She said she felt lonely. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a long time, Cui Shirley has had a need for a sense of belonging and security around her. &quot;From the beginning, I had to directly enter the complex real world. As a result, I didn&#39;t understand many things. This led me to want to find a sense of belonging. And the stable state that comes with a sense of belonging.&quot; In the documentary , the interviewer asked her who she cared about most, and she said they were the members of f(x). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a video interview, f(x) member Luna said that they had not seen each other for five years since Sulli left the group. Shirley once took the initiative to contact her and sent her a text message: &quot;Sister, I miss my sister.&quot; That was the first time in the 15 years since they had known each other that Shirley used the semi-speech between peers instead of honorifics to talk to her. Speech. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It feels like I sent this text message after enduring it for a long time. As a sister, I feel sorry. I should have gone to her first.&quot; Luna cried in front of the camera. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cui Xueli stayed in the &quot;unstable state&quot; of cutting off contact with her mother, falling out of love, leaving the team, and being criticized by the outside world for a long time. Sometimes, she broadcasts live and communicates with fans. Sometimes she shows almost restless excitement, and sometimes she falls into a trance, and her eyes almost lose their sparkle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sulli Cui participated in the creation of all lyrics in the album &quot;Goblin&quot;. One of them is called &quot;On the Moon&quot;, and her true feelings may be hidden in the lyrics. The lyrics read: &quot;Let us ride on the Galaxy Railway 999 together/Now I want to be/a happy girl forever/Your happy girl/Carry the doll in my sleeping dreamland/Drive away the fear in my beautiful dream / The little man on the shoulder took over my memories / Easily took away the flying colors that painted me / In the middle of the night, with my fascination with the world in the book / Take away the freedom of this cold body / Stop my mother from clasping her hands &#39;s prayer/to the moon.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2013, the five members of f(x) went to New Zealand to film a variety show, where they jointly buried their first time capsule as adults.

The article &quot;Talk about my courage education for children&lt;/u>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&quot; made me think back to my past cowardice and think again about what I should do when my children are bullied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One day not long ago, my child came back and told me that a classmate always stepped on his feet when waiting in line and frequently pushed himself during outdoor activities. I asked him, had he told the teacher? The child said that he told her, but when confronted, the other party said that he had not stepped in, and then the matter was settled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I thought about it and the only way I could think of was to stay away from him. I told my son, if he sees him approaching you during outdoor activities, you should stay away from him quickly. My son smiled and said he was so tired, and asked me what if I didn&#39;t guard against him. I was dumbfounded. I wanted to tell him to adapt to circumstances. The subtext of this sentence was to step back, but I didn&#39;t say it out loud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few days later, I went to pick up my children from school. I went there early and was first in line. After picking up my children, I waited aside. When the child&#39;s parents showed up, I walked over and explained the situation to the other mother. The other mother was very polite and said that her child sometimes goes &quot;crazy&quot; and likes to be clingy to others. We will talk about it later. After some time, I asked the child if he had been stepped on recently. The child said that after successfully hiding a few times, he had not been stepped on recently. He went to step on others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My earliest memory of bullying is in the toilet on the rural primary school campus. Several children surrounded a classmate who was urinating. Some were holding small bricks in their hands, and some were moving their fists as if to do something. Ready to swing out at any time. At that time, I often timidly walked out after going to the toilet. Occasionally when no one was outside, I would shout &quot;The teacher is here&quot; and then run away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, there were no obvious differences in the families of bullies or victims. The only obvious difference was that if the victims came from towns, they were more likely to have parents come to school to complain about their children, while victims from rural families were more likely Most of them will not be taken seriously by their parents. Firstly, they are busy with farm work. Secondly, they think that small fights are normal and not worth mentioning. Unless there is a serious physical injury, they will come to school to seek feedback from the teacher. Of course, the quality of the feedback depends on whether you can meet a fair and strict class teacher, rather than being a messy teacher. As for psychological trauma, in rural schools twenty years ago, almost no one had ever heard of such a term. Such neglect will make the victim&#39;s memory become unforgettable, and even decades later it will be awakened due to certain factors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After all these years, I still remember a Japanese drama &quot;Housekeeper Mita&quot; I watched ten years ago. In foreign works, I found some common emotional cowardice in human nature. In the play, while the family was having dinner, they watched a news story about a primary school student who committed suicide after being bullied, which aroused discussion among the family. During the discussion, the younger son was asked if he had been bullied, but he chose to conceal it and deny it. The youngest daughter who is in kindergarten asked Mita why some people bully others. Mita replied expressionlessly that it is because humans are fragile animals who bully the weak and fear the strong. The answer was sharp and harsh. The younger son experienced being coerced by classmates to cooperate in cheating, and finally when he was coerced into stealing, he chose to ask Mita for help. Mita&#39;s &quot;violence&quot; helped put the boy into a dilemma of more serious threats and misunderstandings by his relatives and teachers. When faced with more severe threats of bullying, the younger son once again sought Mita&#39;s &quot;violent&quot; help. This time the help rose to the threat of death. In the confrontation with the bully, the younger son completed his ideological transformation and awakening. He stopped Sita in time and started a boy-to-boy duel with him. Those words of accusation are heartbreaking, but these blood and tears have not changed the bullies, which makes people sigh. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back on the bullying I encountered when I was young, the usual solution was to endure it or avoid it, mostly to survive the sorting or further education. So, when my children faced similar bullying, I didn’t have many alternative answers in mind, and the solutions I threw out were old and pedantic. When I asked a friend who has children, what do you hope to gain if your child is bullied by others, she said that she can communicate freely without being influenced by external factors. She said it in a subtle way. I know that what she is afraid of is encountering injustice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In real-life cases, bullies rarely turn to kindness. Looking at the Korean dramas that are rich in campus bullying dramas, the mode of those dramas will probably move towards the &quot;cool drama&quot; mode, that is, in the end, violence is used to counter violence, and the victim In the end, the violence was suppressed, and the perpetrators were punished by law. However, the reality is that both parties often go to the abyss of tragedy, and the positive ending we expect rarely occurs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Children can be healed from the trauma of bullying. In addition to a small chance of self-healing, the other part is the gentle treatment by other students. When children come back every day, they will share their happiness in school. In addition to occasionally telling who they were bullied by, they also share who helped them. For example, who shared a mosquito repellent bracelet with them, and who helped them forget to forget during outdoor activities. Take the kettle back to the classroom, etc. Those actions that many adults think are trivial have established the feelings of friendship and mutual help among children since childhood. At this time, I will tell him that when others encounter similar problems and you happen to be able to help, you should help. Such actions will invisibly take root and blossom in the other person&#39;s heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The impact of injury or redemption in youth often lasts a lifetime. This has been verified in many realistic works. Fortunately, I still have a warm memory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fifteen years ago, I was in my second year of high school. There was a small college entrance examination that year. I took a few subjects in advance and needed to take a two-hour bus from the town to the city. I had never been on a long-distance bus before, and I started to get motion sickness as soon as I got on the bus. I was sweating and felt dizzy. There were more than a dozen seats in that minibus, and most people had to stand. The female classmates next to me quickly noticed something strange about me. The two girls stood up and asked me to lie down on the seat. They took out cooling oil and applied it to me. That kind of tenderness still warms my heart when I think about it. Their actions helped me learn and have empathy very early on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If I were to compare my progress with that of the previous generation of parents when their children were bullied, it would probably be that my first reaction was to ask where the child was hurt, rather than asking why the child bullied you. Not bullying others. But my parents and I face the same dilemma. Apart from keeping our children away from bullies, there are not many routes and methods for us to choose calmly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a worker in the cultural industry)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>; •&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The &quot;hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of Southern Weekend App is looking forward to your contributions.

The school stipulates that if the front row is not full, the last row will be in violation, which is staggering. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Henan Xinxiang Medical College has launched a school-wide special inspection of academic style since November 20. The inspections included &quot;four no&#39;s&quot;: not bringing teaching materials, not taking notes, not asking questions, and not sitting in the front row. Phenomenon. Henan Institute of Technology requires the establishment of an &quot;inspection-nurture&quot; system, focusing on checking the &quot;attendance rate, head-up rate, and front-row student occupancy rate&quot; of students&#39; classrooms. The School of Transportation Engineering of Changsha University of Science and Technology requires students to take the initiative to &quot;sit in the front row, raise their heads, bring teaching materials, and ask questions&quot;...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first impression this gives people is , treating college students as children. In addition to requiring college students to bring textbooks, sit in the front row, and take notes, many colleges and universities require students not to stay in the dormitory for self-study at night, and there are also bed and hygiene checks. In fact, except for professional courses, classmates may not take the same courses, and different courses use different classrooms. They do not have fixed classrooms and locations like middle school and high school students. Why should we discipline college students like children and fail to respect the right of adults to self-determination? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was in college more than 20 years ago, I still remember that there were two ways for people to occupy positions. For courses with well-educated teachers, wonderful lectures, and popular courses, the front rows will be occupied first, and those who come later will have to sit in the back; for courses with mediocre or unsatisfactory teachers, dry lectures, and less popular courses, Those who came first would occupy the back row, while those who came later had to sit in the front row, endure the direct attention of the teacher, and had to pretend to listen carefully and respond positively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The former method is a medal for a good teacher. The latter method is often because although the class is not interesting or the teaching is poor, but you don’t want to fail, or because the teacher has to take attendance and take attendance, but he can’t retain the students. students will resist in a negative way. Therefore, some teachers often say in the first class: Come and go as you please, without calling names, but you will be responsible for not doing your homework or failing the exam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, for teachers, their primary mission is to transfer valuable professional knowledge and skills to students by relying on their profound knowledge and superb teaching skills. This is to attract students rather than force them to accept it. own teaching content. Good spiritual food is full of fragrant air. If you don&#39;t say anything about peaches and plums, you will make your own mistakes. A melon that is twisted is not sweet, and a horse that doesn&#39;t drink water is meaningless. These principles are well known to everyone, and this is also the basic way to be a teacher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, teachers and schools can only ask themselves to have a good &quot;teaching style&quot; and convince students; instead of first requiring students to have a certain ideal &quot;study style&quot;, There are no requirements for teachers’ teaching ability. This is simply putting the cart before the horse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The lectures are clearly scripted and lackluster. They also require students to sit in the front row as if they are taking a popular course. They force students to raise their heads and act like they are listening attentively, interact in a pretentious manner, and deprive students of passive coping skills. The rights of the curriculum, this is simply to torture students mentally. Moreover, forcing bad courses and bad teachers to enjoy the same treatment as good courses and good teachers is like trying to sell rotten and sour apples at the same price as good and sweet apples. It is completely challenging the laws of the market and human nature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From an economic point of view, higher education or packaged professional subject knowledge products are no different from other goods and services. Teachers and schools are the providers, and students are the demanders. The rights and interests of both parties They are equal in terms of personality, and there is no reason why one party can discipline the other party infinitely. Reasonable classroom discipline is required. For example, no student can disrupt the peace and process of the classroom, because this damages the dignity of the teacher and the rights of other students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But conversely, it cannot be established as a rule or obligation to require college students to listen carefully, because college students are adults. From the perspective of interests, if he feels that the content is important, he will listen carefully and even study further after class. However, if he feels that he has mastered it, either this part of the content is not important, or he underestimates the importance of the content and wanders around. Outside of that, as long as it doesn&#39;t disrupt the peace and flow of the class, it shouldn&#39;t be considered a problem that needs to be solved. From the perspective of rights, there are reasonable boundaries between teachers and students. Students&#39; passive coping is the basic freedom. Students&#39; activeness and seriousness are earned (earned), not deserved. Let students grab the front row and occupy a good seat to get the best. The mental and spiritual enjoyment is the goal of teachers and can even be said to be their duty. At this point, the treatment of college students should be different from that of primary and secondary school students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for supervising whether college students bring textbooks and take notes, this ignores the characteristics of university knowledge transfer. As long as you go to a higher-end university and have teachers who are interested in teaching, the teaching materials for a course are often only outlines and summary, which will definitely involve the reading and discussion of a large number of related books and papers. Unless certain courses follow the textbook, it will be difficult to read. There is no reason why all students must bring textbooks; of course, if the textbook itself is a classic and worthy of in-depth study word for word, then students should generally bring textbooks, but if a student occasionally forgets to bring them, it is not a problem. It can be a perfect solution when used together in the classroom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the teacher is reading from the text, there is no need for students to take notes; if the teacher’s lecture is particularly exciting, then the students will pay full attention and devote themselves to listening, absorbing, and absorbing what the teacher has to say. It becomes your own thing. There is no need to take notes in class, so as not to affect the absorption effect of the present. It can be summarized and organized afterwards, and it can further deepen the understanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A good teaching and learning style is to respect students&#39; sovereignty as adults, allow students to exert their personal autonomy, enhance their ability to self-govern, and cultivate their sense of personal responsibility. The biggest difference between studying in universities and primary and secondary schools is that college students need to invest more in thinking and sharpen their personal understanding and analysis. Learning a major is to logically build a complete knowledge system in their brains and become a major. Part of subjectivity, the memory part is relatively secondary. Force and indoctrination are meaningless. Only things that students truly think through will become their own. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to improve the teaching style and study style of a certain university, a &quot;Typical Case of the School of Medical Imaging Testing and Rehabilitation&quot; was established, and three rules were established: &quot;Sit in the front row&quot;, requiring students to give priority to sitting in the front row; &quot;Double reporting&quot; , if the front row is not full, the school committee will record the list of students in the last row and report it to the teacher and counselor. Pay close attention to the implementation so that everyone does not dare to violate the rules: first time: anonymously report his behavior and ask other students to learn from it; second time: ask him to publicly review his name during the evening roll call, and the class will set up a special team to follow up and inspect; third time: Times: Inform parents that if they commit the crime again, they will need to come to the school to communicate, or they will be &quot;accompanied&quot;. Frankly speaking, this is a way to manage primary school students, and it is a very bad way to manage primary school students. It is not only inappropriate to use it on college students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 22 Nov 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[寿光“明星”果蔬交易所被查，揭开“电子盘”风云二十年]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261073]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-22 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Shouguang is the largest vegetable distribution center in the country.

Visual China/Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After being summoned by the police, Qian Moyouxin went to Zhouyi. He asked a reporter from Southern Weekend for his birthday information and asked &quot;Master Zhou Yi&quot; for a divination. After learning that he and the reporter were destined to meet, he chose an auspicious day to meet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When we met in his office, he was arranging flowers in an open glass vase about half a meter high. The flowers were pruned orchids. An empty vase indicates &quot;deficit&quot;, and all empty vases must be filled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The biggest loss in his life occurred in the &quot;Shouguang Fruit and Vegetable Electronic Disk&quot;. In just four years from 2012, he lost millions of dollars. As a result, the family fell apart and the curve of life fell to the bottom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Electronic trading is an imported product. It originally referred to the electronic bidding platform of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for matching transactions. In China, electronic trading generally refers to electronic platforms for spot trading of commodities outside of official futures exchanges. It was originally established to promote the circulation of commodities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shouguang Fruit and Vegetable Tray was born in 2009 and moved to Tianjin the following year. It is operated by Shandong Shouguang Vegetable Industry Group (Tianjin) Commodity Trading Market Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Tianjin Trading Market). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shouguang is the administrative city of Weifang City and the largest vegetable distribution center in the country. Relying on the famous name of &quot;China&#39;s Hometown of Vegetables&quot;, Shouguang Fruit and Vegetable Tray once became a prestigious electronic tray, with agents all over the country and many traders. Until May 2020, Shouguang Fruit and Vegetable Pan suddenly announced that it would stop the account opening and deposit functions, and the company entity was canceled in November. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The aftermath is even more turbulent. In April 2023, the Public Security Bureau of Ju County, Rizhao City, Shandong Province launched an investigation into the Tianjin Trading Market for &quot;suspected illegal business operations&quot; and took criminal measures against the operation management team and some regional agents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the county-level agent of Shouguang Fruit and Vegetable Distribution District, Qian Moyou was also implicated. In September, he learned from the local police that he was on the fugitive list and needed to go to the Ju County Public Security Bureau to explain the situation and turn over his illegal gains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another agent told Southern Weekend reporters that he had handed over two million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The subsequent development of electronic disks deviated from the original idea. A large number of trading platforms suspected of disguised futures and illegal operations were shut down and cancelled. &quot;It&#39;s a tough battle, a look back, and a clean-up. No industry can continue to clean up and rectify for more than ten years like the spot trading market.&quot; Wang Zaiwei, secretary-general of the Commodity Trading Place Innovation Service Alliance, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He also introduced that there were more than 1,000 trading venues in the country at their peak, but today there are only about 200 left, and more than 200 of them are state-owned holdings and approved by provincial governments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Will the electronic disk, which has grown wildly, come to an end? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Business extended by agents&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“They were banned long ago, so there were not so many people entering the market later.” Qian Moyou recalled that the person who introduced him to open an account had vowed It is said that other trays will die upon inspection, but only the Shouguang fruit and vegetable tray is safe and sound, which shows that it is legitimate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was 2012. After more than 20 years of entrepreneurship, Qian Moyou had saved some funds, but the company was facing a development bottleneck. It happened that a friend introduced him to Shouguang Fruit and Vegetable Pan to invest. Out of a businessman&#39;s caution and unfamiliarity with the agricultural products industry, he was hesitant at first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Seeing that he was still undecided, his friend found a teacher who was familiar with the operation of Shouguang fruit and vegetable trays. The teacher actually plays the role of &quot;calling orders&quot; and guides Qian Moyou to buy and sell. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, Qian Moyou registered as an agent on the Shouguang Fruit and Vegetable Plate website (you can open several accounts), along with several relatives and friends, including public officials and people in the financial industry. &quot;They saw that I had a large amount of funds and suggested that I register as an agent to save some handling fees.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Theoretically, the Shouguang Fruit and Vegetable Tray should attract traders engaged in agriculture. However, according to Shouguang Fruit and Vegetable Plate&#39;s &quot;Spot Spot Transaction Management Measures&quot; obtained by Southern Weekend reporters, you only need to provide your ID card and bank card number to open an account, and you do not need to provide supporting materials if you have a background in the agricultural products industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The software interface used for trading is the same as that of general futures and stock trading software. You can see the price trend K-line chart and centralized bidding transaction information. You can buy or sell agricultural product contracts by paying a 20% margin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Trading adopts the &quot;T+0&quot; system, and contracts of the same direction and type can be traded frequently on the same day. Varieties include pumpkin, winter melon, carrot, dried pepper, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the guidance of the teacher in the early stage, Qian Moyou made a small profit, so he invested more and more funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Moyou typed out the transaction records of several bank cards used for operations at that time, transferred a large number of accounts to himself, and transferred the funds to the Tianjin trading market. But Qian Moyou didn&#39;t want to pull anyone&#39;s head. The few names on the list that he couldn&#39;t remember were the handling fees he returned to the customers at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike Qian Moyou, most agents not only make profits from market transactions, but also service fees are their main source of income. Only when a steady stream of customers open accounts in their own names and guide customers to frequent transactions can agents bring generous returns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Electronic disk development relies on agents. For district and county-level agents like Qian Moyou, Shouguang Fruit and Vegetable Tray generally refunds 75% of the transaction fee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a 2011 judgment, agent Cui signed an agreement with Shouguang Fruit and Vegetable Tray, and the other party entrusted it to develop customers and give customers a 75% rebate on transaction fees. If Cui&#39;s downline Wang continues to develop customers, he will receive a 70% rebate, and if Wang continues to develop his downline Li, he will receive a 68% rebate, once a week. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporter contacted the original Zhengzhou agent of Shouguang Fruit and Vegetable Pan in the name of opening an account. He now provides online account opening for another agricultural product spot trading market, Shengtong Jiulong. If you recommend customers to him, you can open an account according to the daily schedule. The commission will be returned and 75% of the customer&#39;s transaction fee will be obtained. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;After killing the long side, kill the short side&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After following the teacher for a period of time, Qian Moyou initially grasped the trading logic. Take potatoes as an example. Compare the market and spot prices. If the spot price is high, buy long; if the spot price is low, sell short. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He divided his own funds into more than 20 accounts, and worked with the company&#39;s employees to earn a few points from trading every day, which was enough for a day&#39;s salary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the methods taught by teachers sometimes work and sometimes fail. Among Qian Moyou&#39;s friends, some have studied K-line technical knowledge, but they are of no use in the Shouguang fruit and vegetable tray. In the four years since he entered the market, Qian Moyou has &quot;cut his flesh&quot; three or four times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most severe &quot;overturn&quot; was the pumpkin contract in 2014. Qian Moyou made a short order based on the spot market and was able to earn a few points at the beginning. After big funds came in, the market stopped moving. After that, when he opened the website for several days, the limit dropped, and suddenly the limit started to rise in the opposite direction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to keep his position, Qian Moyou had to continue to add margin calls, and even borrowed money from friends and invested all of it in the market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After entering the delivery month, Qian Moyou will top up the margin according to the specified date. Having already made a heavy bet, he firmly believed that the market would return to the spot price and the loss would not be too large. However, the end result was that the market price deviated seriously from the spot price, which also made him want to find goods offline for delivery and close the position. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Soon, Qian Moyou contacted the pumpkin dealer in Yancheng. After some inquiries, the idea of ​​delivery was shattered. After seeing the product quality, appearance, color and other standards stipulated in the delivery agreement, a Yancheng melon seller regretted that the regulations were too detailed. Even if he collected the melons from all the melon farmers in the city and let him choose at will, he would not be able to get the goods stipulated in the agreement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Moyou finally came to his senses and decisively exited the market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;For someone like you, losing millions is nothing.&quot; Dong Hangge spoke in thick Hebei and Lu mandarin. Hearing what happened to Qian Moyou, as a friend he couldn&#39;t help but Ridicule. Dong Hangge, as the municipal agent of Shouguang fruit and vegetable trays, is now also under investigation by the police. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dong Hangge’s experience in investing in electronic trading is much richer than that of Qian Moyou. He has participated in the famous Dragon Cauldron Trading and has learned the ropes of electronic trading - you have to buy against the main funds to make money. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This is a virtual disk, do you understand?&quot; Dong Hangge couldn&#39;t help but say, you are real money, and the person who is &quot;in charge&quot; is a string of fictitious numbers. Assuming that all the main funds are doing long, the market will pull in the opposite direction, forcing the long parties to cut their losses. Only by guessing the right direction can you make money along the way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his view, working as an agent earns handling fees, but it is not enough to earn handling fees alone. He also has to help his big customers make money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to inquire about the flow of funds on the market, Dong Hangge once hired a young college graduate to lurk into the municipal agent with the largest amount of client funds to inquire about the direction. He then directed his clients to go in the opposite direction. Do. On a potato contract, one of his big clients earned a full eight million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dong Hangge suggested that big customers should close the deal as soon as they get a good deal. Unfortunately, the customers were not satisfied. As Dong Hangge expected, the dish was full of flavour, and the customer vomited out more than half of what he had eaten. &quot;If someone (the banker) kills the short side, he will definitely turn around and kill you on the long side.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Taking the &quot;Shouguang Garlic Plate&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Before going to the Public Security Bureau, Qian Moyou spent more than ten dollars I searched for information every day to study why I was &quot;operating illegally.&quot; Only then did we discover that the spot trading market was once a product of local economic revitalization and innovation and reform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chang Qing, founder of China Futures Market and former researcher at the Development Research Center of the State Council, told Southern Weekend reporters that agricultural product production is scattered and farmers need price signals that can reflect market supply and demand to rationally allocate resources. &quot;The Shouguang Vegetable Wholesale Market can solve the problem of vegetable circulation, but it cannot solve the problem of low prices of vegetables hurting farmers.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since 1990, China has successively established five major futures exchanges. However, most agricultural products failed to enter the futures market. Chang Qing explained that most agricultural products are not suitable for entering the futures market with a large amount of capital due to their small delivery volume and easy contract manipulation (forced position). However, these varieties can be traded and innovated by local platforms or wholesale markets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To this end, Shouguang began to explore medium and forward trading of vegetables, which is equivalent to locking in the price of agricultural products for farmers in advance. It is a trading model between futures and spot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2005, with the approval of the Shandong Provincial Government, four units including the China Vegetable Circulation Association jointly funded the establishment of Shandong Shouguang Vegetable Electronic Trading Market Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Shouguang Electronic Market), which can realize &quot;unplanted vegetables&quot;. &quot;Sell first&quot; and &quot;sell before receiving&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Jun, the manager of Shouguang Electronic Disk at the time, introduced that Shouguang Electronic Disk will announce the purchase price for the next 10 months, and the growers or brokers will sell the orders before planting, and deliver the quality products at maturity. goods to avoid the risks brought by falling prices to farmers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Zaiwei began operating a commodity exchange in Shandong in 2007. He told Southern Weekend reporters that the trading volume of garlic varieties was good in the early days, and most of the participants were cold storage owners, garlic dealers and brokers. These people themselves are spot customers. Through electronic transactions, they only need advance payment to complete the transaction, saving warehousing and transportation costs. &quot;The purpose of (local trading venues) is to support the actual needs of spot customers.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the electronic trading did not operate as originally envisioned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shouguang electronic plate really started to become famous because of garlic, and thus got a more famous name &quot;Shouguang garlic plate&quot;. Garlic is also called &quot;white tiger&quot;. Tigers can eat people, and garlic can also eat people. If investors are not careful, they will lose all their money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The high volatility of garlic prices has made it the most suitable variety for speculation among vegetables. Although Shouguang is the hometown of vegetables, it does not produce garlic. In 2005, Shouguang electronic disk entered the &quot;Garlic Township&quot; - Jinxiang County, Jining City, Shandong Province. By 2010, Jinxiang County had gathered five or six electronic trading markets. Among them, the two larger ones, besides Shouguang Electronic Trading, were Longding Electronic Trading. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;At that time, electronic disk was regarded as an emerging industry such as e-commerce, and many local governments actively introduced it as a key project.&quot; Zhao Defa, former vice chairman of the Shandong Provincial Writers Association, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhao Defa wrote in his documentary work &quot;White Tiger&quot; that &quot;Garlic God&quot; Dong Zigang helped Shouguang build a garlic electronic disk. A president of the Garlic Chamber of Commerce commented that since Dong Zigang joined the industry, traditional trade has been changed and capital operations have been introduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dong Zigang is from Junan, Shandong, and settled in Weifang. He made his fortune in Shouguang Garlic Distribution, and successively operated Jinxiang Nandianzi and Hengli Distribution, and served as the president of Hengfeng Electronic Distribution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Electronic disks also created a myth - Fu Haitang, a farmer with a background in pig raising. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2009, Fu Haitang invested tens of thousands of yuan earned in soybean meal futures into Shouguang electronic trading. Coinciding with the rare &quot;garlic you are ruthless&quot; market, Shouguang electronic trading has introduced a &quot;centralized transfer&quot; system, that is, if there are three consecutive daily limit or three lower limit, positions will be closed by agreement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fu Haitang wrote in his self-report that the main short seller at the time greeted the exchange. When the market price of garlic increased 30 times, he only earned 700,000 and was transferred centrally, so he switched to Longding Pan. , earned 6 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was also this wave of market conditions that caused the short sellers of the Long Ding Pan to misjudge the situation, which even dragged down the Long Ding Pan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2010, Rizhao City Deputy Mayor Wantong announced the results of the investigation into the Longding electronic trading incident to traders: After the garlic market changed dramatically, Longding failed to liquidate short sellers in accordance with regulations and instead lent Hou Dawei, the main short seller, used 30 million virtual funds to short-sell. After losing money, he misappropriated customer margins to continue short-selling and bet against traders, resulting in a serious deviation between the market price and the spot price. He lost hundreds of millions of margins and traders were unable to withdraw money normally. And after some contracts enter the delivery period, there are still huge amounts of open positions that cannot be delivered smoothly, causing disputes over delivery breaches. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This matter quickly triggered a regulatory storm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The China Securities Regulatory Commission led 7 ministries and commissions to form a State Council commodity trading market investigation team that entered Shandong, and its first stop was Weifang. &quot;China Business News&quot; reported that Jiang Yang, then chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, inspected a commodity trading venue in Weifang and denounced the incident angrily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before this round of regulatory rectification, many electronic disks collapsed due to problems such as virtual fund transactions, poor delivery, and founders running away with their money. Executives were arrested and jailed. However, the huge funds gathered in electronic disks It still attracts batches of &quot;gamblers&quot;. If you pour down a platform, you will burn a platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Zaiwei once wrote that from 2007 to 2010, a large number of trading venues emerged in Shandong, forming a situation where &quot;the whole country looks to Shandong for bulk, and Shandong looks to Weifang for bulk&quot;. &quot;There was no approval, no review, no supervision, no rules. At that time, it was completely open to work.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if you get the approval, you still rely on the platform to show your magic. There are various approval departments, &quot;There are National Development and Reform Commission, Commerce Bureau, as well as the Finance Office.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2012, the Economic Development Zone Branch of the Yancheng City Public Security Bureau of Jiangsu Province characterized Hengfeng Electronic Trading as a disguised futures market, and Dong Zigang was jailed for ten years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Shouguang electronic disk survived. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2009, Shouguang Electronic Disk was acquired by the private enterprise Shouguang Vegetable Industry Holding Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Shouguang Vegetable Industry Holdings), which was owned by Shandong Shouguang Vegetable Industry Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Shouguang Vegetable Industry Group) ) is funded and established. On June 17 of the same year, Shouguang Vegetable Industry Group established Shouguang Fruit and Vegetable Plate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to the official website, Shouguang Vegetable Industry Group has been selected as one of the top 500 national key leading enterprises in agricultural industrialization and is a nationally renowned operator of the entire vegetable industry chain. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Move to Tianjin&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Either leave or close.&quot; Wang Zaiwei said that Jiang Yang&#39;s inspection put great pressure on the Weifang government, and several local exchanges were forced to make a choice. It was at this stage that Shouguang Fruit and Vegetable Tray moved to Tianjin, and Tianjin also became a new gathering place for various exchanges across the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The relevant person in charge of Shouguang Vegetable Industry Holdings revealed in an interview with the self-media &quot;High Power Lens&quot; that Shouguang Fruit and Vegetable Tray was invited by the Tianjin Municipal Government to move to Tianjin in December 2010 as a key agricultural financial innovation project. Settled in Binhai New Area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Each region’s understanding and cognition of commodity trading are very different.” Wang Zaiwei said that whether trading venues can continue to operate at this stage depends on the attitude of local regulatory authorities. In other words, the attitude of local regulatory authorities is crucial. play a decisive role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the clean-up and rectification becomes more stringent, provincial people&#39;s governments formulate regulatory rules for exchanges. Some local governments assign regulatory responsibilities to the Commerce Bureau and some to the Financial Bureau. &quot;There are still huge differences in regulatory policies across the country.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Economic Herald, from 2010 to April 2013, the professional managers of Shouguang Fruit and Vegetable Tray were Ji Hairong and Meng Qingchao (who did not hold shares). President Ji Hairong is the soul of Shouguang Fruit and Vegetable Plate. He has worked for many commodity exchanges. People in the industry are more familiar with his QQ nickname &quot;Tycoon&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2012, Shouguang Fruit and Vegetable Tray also revealed the problem of poor settlement that cannot be escaped from electronic trading. In April 2013, Ji Hairong and Meng Qingchao both lost contact. Later, it was confirmed by the media that Ji Hairong and others had been taken compulsory measures by the Shouguang City Public Security Bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Shouguang Fruit and Vegetable Tray is still operating normally after the accident of the two responsible persons. In their resignation announcement, they also stated that their business operations during their tenure were in compliance with relevant national laws and regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the years of operation of Shouguang Fruit and Vegetable Tray, its historical shareholders include Shouguang Vegetable Industry Group, Shouguang Vegetable Industry Holdings, etc., and the major shareholder is Yang Ming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Ming is quite mysterious and low-key, and the locals know little about him. At present, his appearance can only be seen from the company&#39;s official website: sparse hair, a shiny forehead, and a beer belly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A municipal agent has participated in several Shouguang fruit and vegetable plate meetings and met Yang Ming and a group of senior executives. The guests attending the meeting were all government officials and experts in the futures field, and they preached about the standardization of the platform. After the meeting, experts will also attend a banquet with the leaders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The offices of Shouguang Vegetable Industry Group and Shouguang Vegetable Industry Holdings controlled by Yang Ming are both located in Shouguang Vegetable Building.

Southern Weekend reporter Zhou Xiaoling/Photo&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; Futures or spot? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Electronic disks like Shouguang fruit and vegetable disk were established as spot trading markets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Wang Deyi, director of Beijing Xunzhen Law Firm, told Southern Weekend reporters that in the Shouguang fruit and vegetable market, a large number of customers engage in electronic transactions without physical delivery and buy and sell standardized contracts in a centralized transaction manner. There are many cases in the Supreme People&#39;s Court. This is the core feature of &quot;illegal futures&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the field of spot commodities, Wang Deyi’s legal team has obtained the first winning verdicts in many places, and has represented many contract disputes between Shouguang Fruit and Vegetable Tray investors and trading platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You Zhihui, who lives in Jiangsu, is one of the few investors interviewed who has had delivery experience. Since most investors have never actually participated in the delivery, they do not know the location of the delivery warehouse for Shouguang fruit and vegetable trays. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2016, You Zhihui has been operating in Shouguang Fruit and Vegetable Tray for a year and a half, but lost 1.2 million yuan. What really made him lose trust in the market was a delivery the following year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the eve of the delivery, You Zhihui received a dried pick -up bill sent by the agent to him. The payment time was March 1, 2017, and asked him to go through the delivery procedures on March 2. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The quality level of the pick -up sheet is the standard product, the measurement unit is 78 tons, and the settlement warehouse is the Yinshan cold storage of Ma Ying Township, Wucheng County, Texas. The company&#39;s investigation shows that the cold storage does have dried peppers. The contact contact person is Shan Yongning. He is the legal representative of the Tianjin trading market. The reporter from the Southern Weekend called the phone call on the withdrawal list, and the number could not be connected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; You Zhihui went to Texas, Shandong to say that it was more than 700 kilometers, and it was not much of the transportation fee to return to Jiangsu. To this end, You Zhihui contacted several local pepper acquirers to deliver them together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, the problem lies in the acceptance session. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The warehouse transfer party asked You Zhihui to pull the goods on the delivery day, but refused to provide the product entry information, which caused You Zhihui to be unable to check whether the commodity was a contract agreed in the contract. goods. The warehouse transfer party even wanted to acquire You Zhihui&#39;s dried peppers at a very low price. You Zhihui filed an application for re -inspection to the trading market without complementary incidents, and the event failed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Most of the electronic disks Wang Deyi have been exposed to the flow of customer funds can not be clearly introduced, and the total transaction volume and physical delivery data of the trading venue cannot be realized. number of clients. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In addition, the price of frequent changes does not actually encourage delivery, and investors all want to earn the difference through the difference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Standardized contracts for buying and selling are also one of the characteristics of futures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The Securities Regulatory Commission has a detailed definition of standardized contracts: in addition to the terms of price, delivery location, and delivery time, other terms are relatively fixed. After the contract is established, the traders are allowed to perform unrealisticly. Through reverse operation, they will leave the field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Other terms refer to the number of transaction products, the trading deposit, the quotation unit, the quality standard of the delivery, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;I used to compare (Shouguang Fruit and Vegetables) and the strong wheat futures contract text of the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange. There is no essential difference between the two.&quot; Wang Deyi said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Although the transaction model and transaction details of the Shouguang fruit and vegetable disk are pointing to the &quot;futures&quot;, the lawsuit is still difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In a large number of effective judgments about the Tianjin trading market, the court of Tianjin did not judge it as an illegal futures. According to the basis, after the Tianjin trading market issued a document on the 38th of 2011 and No. 37, 2012, it has not been closed, banned or suspended by the issue of futures activities and engaging in futures transactions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The Tianjin Second Intermediate People&#39;s Court has accepted the dispute between Dong Yumei and the Tianjin trading market.

For example, young people Signing up for the &quot;Sunset Red&quot; tour group, some office workers who don&#39;t want to order takeout flocked to the canteen for the elderly, and some young people squeezed into various interest classes at the university for the elderly and discovered &quot;really delicious&quot;... These new trends on social platforms, It is ridiculed by the outside world as &quot;old-fashioned consumption&quot;. Why has moving closer to the consumption patterns of middle-aged and elderly people become the “life they aspire to” for many young people? How to treat it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, I think the direct motivation for &quot;old-fashioned consumption&quot; is low price attraction. Whether it is a &quot;Sunset Red&quot; tour group, a canteen for the elderly, or a university for the elderly, what they all have in common is the relatively low price. The presupposition is that the elderly retire from their jobs and have no financial resources except pensions. With little other income, the selling price of goods or services targeted at this group is naturally lower than the normal market price. More importantly, as part of the social security system for the elderly, the government pays for some services or items (in this case, there is some controversy about young people taking advantage of the elderly), and some businesses have also started to pay for them in order to promote sales. Give it to the elderly. The fact that young people are &quot;mingling among them&quot; undoubtedly reflects their pursuit of low-priced goods or services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, traveling can be regarded as a relaxing experience. The recipes in the elderly canteen will most likely not be any different. The courses taught by the elderly university cover flower arrangement, painting, calligraphy and other talents and skills. Skills, the quality of these goods or services will not be too bad. In other words, it is not an exaggeration to say that the above-mentioned goods or services have the basic characteristics of &quot;high quality and low price&quot; and good cost performance. Young people have discovered this opportunity and made full use of it to enrich and enrich themselves. I think it is a wise move. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, this truly reflects the objective fact that young people are under great pressure to survive. The overall economy is in a downward trend, the population is aging, the subsequent impact of the epidemic has not been completely eliminated, and the number of college graduates is increasing. The competition for employment is extremely fierce and it is difficult to find a job. At the same time, they are also faced with work pressure, promotion pressure, renting and buying a house, pressure to get married and start a family, pressure to have children, etc. To be honest, the overall survival and development situation of contemporary young people Not optimistic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Considering specific activities such as traveling and attending classes at senior universities, we believe that young people’s participation in them is a response to the high-intensity, high-pressure, and fast-paced production that young people generally find themselves in in the context of urbanization and modernization. A kind of resistance, rebellion and temporary escape (escapism) from the way of life. Faced with various production and lifestyles with &quot;involution&quot; as their basic characteristics, which have no way to escape, young people can actively debug, adjust and make some changes, and achieve relief and decompression through travel, study, etc. Purpose, I think it is a pretty good thing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, &quot;old-fashioned consumption&quot; should not be understood in a narrow sense as the field of consumption, but should be interpreted from the perspective of the specific consumption process and the concrete experience in the consumption process, that is, the social nature of consumption cannot or is not easily ignored. feature. The core essence of &quot;old-fashioned consumption&quot; is that young people and the elderly get along and interact with each other for a certain period of time. Travel can be as short as one or two days, as long as three to five days or a week, to eat in the elderly canteen and to attend classes at the elderly university. This allows young people and older people to spend more time together, and such interactions will produce significant learning effects. And this kind of learning is two-way rather than one-way, because through such interactions and exchanges, young people can gain life experience provided by their elders, and the elders can be infected by the vitality or passion of young people. Especially for the elderly, if young people are willing to listen to their stories or sharing, they usually feel happy and satisfied, and their sense of self-worth will be significantly enhanced. In this sense, the precise expression of &quot;old-fashioned consumption&quot; should be &quot;mutual consumption&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A direct effect of this &quot;old-fashioned consumption&quot; is to repair or improve the relationship between young people and their older relatives in their families or clans. In reality, there are some young people, especially young men, who have little communication with their parents. They often keep a distance from their parents in the name of generation gap. This is the so-called &quot;disconnection&quot; phenomenon, but they have no relationship with their parents outside. Communication among the elderly is tolerant, and some young people often take the initiative or actively communicate with the elderly. Obviously, occasional or regular participation in &quot;old-fashioned consumption&quot; will undoubtedly have a positive effect on increasing the close relationship between young people and their families. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for &quot;old-fashioned consumption&quot;, some people may think that this will squeeze out the resources of the elderly. A bunch of chattering young people suddenly join the tour group, and the elderly will feel that the young people have somewhat affected their &quot; &quot;The right to tranquility&quot;; when a bunch of young people suddenly come to join in the fun in the seniors&#39; canteen, the old people will feel it is too noisy; when a bunch of young people suddenly break into the classroom to teach, the old people will feel crowded and uncomfortable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The more fundamental doubt is that the above-mentioned various special services or benefits only for the elderly are paid for by the government and are part of the security system for the elderly. Now, young people are flocking to them, and there is obvious The rights or rights of the elderly are suspected of being raided. But the author believes that we should not understand the word &quot;resource&quot; statically. If the elderly or even most elderly people benefit from and acquire it because of the participation or joining of young people, this is undoubtedly another hidden precious resource. It should be noted that resources are not only economic-oriented, but also include social-oriented resources in a broad sense, which mainly refers to the level of social communication and social interaction; resources are not limited to initial static resources, and resources in a broad sense also exist after the initial resource investment. Learned resources, we might as well imagine the latter as the multiplier effect in the field of economics or investment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What I mean is that a cross-age or mixed-age (fixed structure) population structure usually produces a good comprehensive effect because each other benefits from or benefits from mutual exchanges and learning. We can also understand it as the application or application of economies of scale and economies of scope theories in daily life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I couldn’t help but think of two things. One is in Japan. During the layout process, some kindergartens or primary schools will choose to be adjacent to nursing homes. At eight o&#39;clock in the morning, the elderly can hear the sound of reading aloud from next door as scheduled; at four o&#39;clock in the afternoon, the elderly will see the school after school at the entrance of the nursing home. The children bowed to themselves and politely said &quot;Hello Grandpa&quot; and &quot;Wish you a happy day, Grandma&quot;; on weekends or holidays, a group of children and their teachers came to the nursing home to perform performances for the elderly, eat together, and Play games, and as feedback, the elderly can occasionally or often go to the school next door to talk about the past and present lives of their city or community. I believe that this is the proper meaning of &quot;being productive in old age&quot; and &quot;being happy in old age&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The other is that in recent years, some domestic cities have proposed to build urban development goals for specific groups. For example, Shanghai proposed to build an age-friendly city, Beijing proposed to build a youth-friendly city, and Shenzhen proposed to build a child-friendly city. Changsha proposes to build a female-friendly city. I just wonder, if this kind of special care for a certain group of people is singled out and used as an important part of urban development goals or urban development strategies, isn&#39;t it suspected of &quot;social deprivation&quot; for other groups? ? What do you mean by just being friendly to the elderly? Unfriendly to young people? Not child friendly? Is its essential point that when this kind of preferential policy for specific groups of people is used as an urban development goal or strategy, there will inevitably be a package of follow-up measures in terms of funds, projects, policies, planning, etc. To put it more bluntly, It means that a lot of real money is invested in specific groups of people, which is obviously not fair and reasonable for other groups. In the long run, this move is intended to harm or harm the city&#39;s diversity, inclusiveness and equity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similarly, I also disagree with the suggestions or suggestions of some people and even some experts to build special women&#39;s (subway) carriages or children&#39;s (high-speed rail) carriages. Why can’t we build a high-end society that is gender-friendly, gender-equal, and gender-integrated through extensive publicity and innovative practices? Why can&#39;t we be tolerant of children who are active or crying, or even adopt more positive and proactive methods, such as actively chatting with children, playing games, playing poker, etc., so that children can feel the affection of uncles, aunts, brothers and sisters in the carriage? What about warmth? Obviously, whether it is a women&#39;s (subway) carriage or a children&#39;s (high-speed rail) carriage, they are all short-sighted moves aimed at evading and avoiding the problem, and they are all deliberately or deliberately aimed at &quot;distinctiveness&quot; and &quot;community isolation&quot; ” (social segregation), all of which are against or deviating from the basic principles of mixed-age or cross-age. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a professor at the Department of Sociology, Guangzhou University)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010; &quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 22 Nov 2023 15:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
