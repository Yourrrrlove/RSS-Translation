Lawrence was immersed in writing his war memoirs. After being expelled from the Paris Peace Conference a year ago, this famous World War I hero was struggling with persistent depression. Only writing could temporarily pull him out of the swamp of despair. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The silence was broken by a ringing sound. It was a call from Whitehall in London - the other party was Winston Churchill, who was to be the Colonial Secretary. He wanted to invite Lawrence to assist him in handling Middle Eastern affairs. This controversial figure who was reduced to a &quot;political pariah&quot; five years ago due to his defeat in the Middle East battlefield has made a comeback and is trying to figure out how to deal with the mess of the British Empire in the Middle East. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;World War I&quot; has ended, the Ottoman Empire has been dismembered, and peace has not come: In Palestine, conflicts between the Zionists supported by the British and the local Arabs quickly intensified, and eventually escalated to Bloody conflicts; even more serious was the outbreak of a full-scale anti-British uprising in Iraq, an oil-producing area controlled by the British, and tens of thousands of people died in bloodshed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The allies are not having a good time either - in the desert of Transjordan, Prince Abdullah from the Hashemite family has been ferociously attacking the French who control the Syrian region. A few months ago, the French had just used force to seize this territory from Faisal, another prince of the family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 1919, the Paris Peace Conference, which had been wrangling for half a year, came to an end. The Middle East, divided among the victors, is filled with hatred, bloodshed and conflict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despite Lawrence&#39;s rejection, Churchill had no intention of giving up. This extraordinary man, who would go on to become one of the most important statesmen of the 20th century, knew that Lawrence of Arabia was the key to unraveling this mess. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These two unconventional &quot;political pariahs&quot; are about to work together to shape the history of the Middle East. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/JQGwRMz0I9faA6cyJmqWkJTwlimow6j76NZC5o42.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/JQGwRMz0I9faA6cyJmqWkJTwlimow6j76NZC5o42.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259968&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1913, Lawrence (second from right) and British archaeologist Leonard Woolley participated in archaeological operations at the ancient Hittite city Carchemish in the Ottoman Empire. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Smart &quot;illegitimate son&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;He is an Irish nobleman who eloped with his mistress crystallization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to avoid social pressure, Lawrence&#39;s parents lived in the countryside anonymously, moving frequently and barely interacting with their neighbors. It was not until for the education and future of his five sons that he boldly moved to the bustling Oxfordshire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of the teacher, this boy is very smart, has a quiet personality, loves books, but is also fond of playing pranks. He especially likes to play various games that test his extreme survival endurance, such as not drinking water, not eating, and not sleeping. He can always persist until he faints and collapses by relying on his willpower. The principal of Oxford Public School recalled that Lawrence was very different from boys of the same age. He was somewhat like the Stoics of ancient Greece. He &quot;didn&#39;t care about physical pleasure or pain.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The young Lawrence had excellent academic performance. , is particularly obsessed with medieval knight literature, and is interested in military history and archeology. Every holiday, he would ride a bicycle with his friends to explore England&#39;s ancient monuments, and also work as an assistant at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. He was later admitted to Jesus College, Oxford University, where he majored in history. During his college years, he cycled 2,400 miles to inspect ancient castles and military ruins in Europe, dining and sleeping all the way to the Mediterranean. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 1909, in order to clarify an academic case in medieval military history, he went to Syria alone to investigate. Under the scorching sun, he set out from Beirut, passed through the mountains of Lebanon, and reached northern Palestine; three weeks later, he returned to Beirut and went north to continue more arduous archaeology. After returning, he wrote a paper &quot;The Influence of the Crusades on European Military Architecture in the 12th Century&quot; and won Oxford&#39;s highest first-class excellence award. In addition, a scholarship for postgraduate studies was awarded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1910, the British Museum launched archaeological excavations at the ruins of the ancient city of Carchemish on the border between Turkey and Syria today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawrence served as a junior assistant and soon became the excavation site superintendent, supervising more than two hundred locally hired workers. He did an outstanding job. He often chatted with workers in Arabic, visited their homes, and recorded their folklore, structural relationships within families and between tribes, and their views on politics. The workers also had a good impression of this young European because he truly respected their customs and culture and was willing to accept hospitality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that at that time, no Westerner knew more about Syria than Lawrence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Carchemish, Lawrence and a 13-year-old Syrian boy were inseparable and very close. The boy whom he calls Dahom in his memoirs, his real name is Selim Ahmed, the “SA” to whom Lawrence dedicated his war memoir Seven Pillars of Wisdom. Dahom is smart and handsome, with two deep dimples on his face and an innocent and bright smile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the curiosity of a scholar, Lawrence developed a true appreciation and respect for Near Eastern culture through his contact and study with local society. He began to reflect on the arrogant imperialist consciousness of the West regarding &quot;Western enlightenment and civilization of backward nations.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a scholar who has truly penetrated into the hinterland of Syria, Lawrence has clearly seen the general trend of the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, the Ottoman Empire, which had ruled the Arabian Peninsula for more than four centuries and spanned Asia, Africa and Europe, had entered its twilight and was known as the &quot;sick man of Europe&quot;. With the rise of nationalism and the development of international commerce around the world, the Ottomans faced more and more challenges at home and abroad. Externally, European powers undergoing industrialization are constantly encroaching on its territory and sovereignty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/EA0uVznH9pUk8pS2iktOaARUYAcUBK0W02Ldofh1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;735&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/EA0uVznH9pUk8pS2iktOaARUYAcUBK0W02Ldofh1.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259971&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In November 1917, the British Egyptian Expeditionary Force broke through the Ottoman army&#39;s defense lines and captured Palestine; in December, the British army entered Jerusalem&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;( Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Within the empire, forces promoting reform and demanding modernization have always existed. In 1908, a group of young military officers known as the &quot;Young Turks&quot; launched a coup and forced Hamid II to restore the parliamentary constitution. In 1913, the nationalist radical wing of the party came to power and established a centralized authoritarian system with the &quot;Three Oligarchs&quot; as the core. They adjusted the reform plan to promote modernization, defend Islam and pan-Turkism in order to unite the people within the empire&#39;s borders. every group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in a huge empire with multiple languages, multi-ethnic groups, and extremely complex social composition, no reform program can appease all groups: secularization efforts have greatly angered the large number of traditional Muslims. ; Advocating Pan-Turkism also makes other non-Turkish ethnic groups, such as Arabs and Armenians, feel resentful...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this moment, what the young archaeologist is obsessed with is the land, work, and friendship under his feet. And love. When he was determined to devote the next four to five years to the excavation and research of the ancient city ruins, bad news came: the British Museum project funds had been exhausted, and the excavation work had to be suspended until new funds were available. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But there is another job opportunity: funded by a foundation, a contingent of the British Royal Engineers is going to conduct an archaeological expedition to the desert area in southern Palestine and needs to recruit two archaeologists. Ask them if they are interested. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawrence and his companions readily accepted. &quot;Xunmo&quot; is in the southern part of Israel today. According to the Old Testament, it was the last place where the ancient Jews, led by the prophet Moses, left Egypt and wandered in the wilderness for forty years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As smart as Lawrence, he quickly guessed that this expedition in the name of the foundation was actually a secret military geographical survey. At that time, Britain sent troops to occupy the buffer zone of the Suez Canal and the Sinai Peninsula, and relations with the Ottoman Empire had always been tense. When the &quot;World War I&quot; broke out, because they were worried that the Ottomans would attack Egypt and seize the canal once they allied with Germany, the British wanted to find out the other side of the buffer zone on the east side of the Suez Canal - from the southeastern part of the Palestinian coast to the Gulf of Aqaba. conditions in the desert. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person in charge of this operation was British Captain Stuart Newcomb. He developed a liking for this Oxford scholar who didn&#39;t care about enjoyment and had amazing endurance even to the point of masochism. He was particularly impressed by his eccentricities - in general, Lawrence was an extremely shy person by nature, but once someone tried to Hinder or fool him, and he will become determined and bold. During his adventure in the desert, he was constantly monitored and obstructed by the Ottoman military police. Lawrence fully demonstrated his ability to break through like a child&#39;s mischievous child. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the outbreak of World War I, he brought Lawrence into the British military intelligence agency in Cairo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 28, 1914, Archduke Ferdinand, the Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary, and his wife were assassinated in Sarajevo, and World War I broke out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October, Lawrence, who had just turned 26, was sent to the Geography Section of the British General Staff as a cartographer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the high-ranking military and political officials of the empire, this conceited young man still looks slovenly and carefree, indifferent to all kinds of rules and regulations. In his eyes, these pretentious high-ranking officials are all empty-minded fools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because a general wanted a distinguished officer to report to him, Lawrence was dramatically promoted to second lieutenant. But what he longs for is to go to the front line and show off his skills. Lawrence is less than 1.65 meters tall, below the minimum standard of the British Army, so the only opportunity to go to the front line is where his special talents are needed - the Middle East battlefield. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 2, 1914, the Ottoman Empire finally joined the Allies and officially entered the war. On December 15, Lawrence arrived in Cairo on a French motorboat and reported to the military intelligence unit led by Newcomb. At this time, Cairo was noisy and noisy. It was already an important transit hub for personnel and materials in the &quot;World War I&quot;. Hundreds of thousands of British colonial troops from India, Australia and New Zealand traveled from here to the European battlefield. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/Of9gtmLeIhFGX1qVqGIyxmTuHCLtIjZQWHSZct3r.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;632&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/Of9gtmLeIhFGX1qVqGIyxmTuHCLtIjZQWHSZct3r.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259969&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1918, Lawrence led and launched the most ferocious attack on the Hejaz Railway in the Daraa area. The picture shows Lawrence inspecting the destroyed train &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Million Cracks of &quot;The Sick Man of Europe&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;In the British intelligence agency in Cairo, one of Lawrence&#39;s jobs was to write reports describing the topography, culture and ethnic composition of the Ottoman Empire for senior officials in London. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many years of experience in Syrian society have allowed Lawrence to see the countless cracks within this old empire. In the huge territory that the Turks put together by force during their heyday, there are many people who have no intention of fighting this war. ethnic groups related to the war; they were already full of resentment against the Turkish rulers, and the war made this hatred deeper and deeper. The largest population in this empire was the Arabs who believed in Islam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1908, the modernization and secular reforms implemented by the Young Turks after coming to power angered Hussein ibn Ali, the religious political leader who controlled the Hijaz region of the Arabian Peninsula. He is the head of the famous Hashemite family, a direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, and has guarded the Holy Land of Mecca for generations. As a &quot;holy descendant&quot;, Hussein is one of the most respected religious leaders in the Islamic world and has strong influence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Ottoman Empire joined the &quot;World War I&quot;, relations between the two sides worsened. As a religious leader, Hussein remained silent regarding the official propaganda of the so-called &quot;holy war&quot;; the Ottoman Empire asked him to send troops to assist in seizing the Suez Canal, but he only sent his second son Abdullah to lead a small team to perfunctory the task. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, in February 1914, before the outbreak of World War I, Abdullah took the opportunity of visiting Cairo to visit Lord Kitchener, then the Governor of British Egypt. Sexually asked: How would Britain react if an Arab uprising broke out in the Hijaz region? Kitchener carefully avoided it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the Ottoman Empire officially entered the war in November 1914, Kitchener, who became the British Minister of War, immediately sent a coded message to Cairo, asking his old subordinate Stowers to send someone to secretly tell Abdullah Contact to find out Hussein&#39;s true attitude. This time, Hussein cautiously replied that he would remain neutral, but at the same time hinted that if the British provided external assistance and promised not to interfere in Arab internal affairs, he might lead his followers in an uprising. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This made Kitchener very happy. He wrote in a letter to Hussein - &quot;From today on, we will be friends with the noble Arabs.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Learned After receiving these secret letters, Lawrence felt like a &quot;divine revelation&quot; - after arriving in Cairo, he had been studying the possibility of launching an Arab uprising in Syria. The battlefield in the Middle East was far away from Europe and resources were relatively scarce. Therefore, Lawrence believed that Britain needed to adopt an unconventional war, that is, to use the social and national contradictions and divisions within the Ottoman Empire to join forces with the dissatisfied elements and help them launch an uprising. overthrow Turkish rule. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/5TneGpF03MprbuQRXwbRsHtN9q7Q15l7j7YPZAYv.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;743&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/5TneGpF03MprbuQRXwbRsHtN9q7Q15l7j7YPZAYv.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259973&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Faisal (front row) and Lawrence (second row, second from right) during the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The uprising in a secret agreement&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From July 1915 to January 1916, Hussein and the British High Commissioner to Egypt Henry Mack Mahon exchanged letters secretly to negotiate cooperation. Several Arab nationalist secret societies in Syria were also secretly contacting Hussein, hoping to join forces to launch an uprising against the Turks, with support from the British and using him as the spiritual leader of the uprising. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But what made Hussein finally decide to turn to the British was a rumor - it was rumored that Constantinople intended to depose him and replace him with the leader of the Zaid family. On May 6, 1916, Gemal Pasha, one of the Ottoman &quot;Three Oligarchs&quot;, publicly executed 21 Arab nationalists in Damascus. Hussein sent his son Faisal to intercede, but was rejected and intimidated. , which made him even more uneasy about his future destiny. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In these secret communications, the British assured Hussein that if he led his troops to assist the British army in the Middle East war, the British would assist him in establishing a kingdom between Egypt and Persia after the war, but Excludes Kuwait, Aden and the Arab Empire along the Syrian coast. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, MacMahon also inserted an obscure condition in the letter: these commitments would only take effect &quot;so long as Britain is free to decide without endangering the interests of its ally France&quot;. Among them, the part about Palestine was not mentioned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When France learned that Britain and Hussein were negotiating a secret agreement, it immediately made a claim. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 1916, an &quot;amateur politician&quot; named Mark Sykes, an aristocrat, and the French diplomat François Georges-Picot reached an agreement on war in London. The draft of the post-Middle East vision was later formally signed in Petrograd, Russia, known as the Sykes-Picot Agreement in history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to this secret agreement: the independent Arab countries were roughly restricted to the desert of the Arabian Peninsula, France directly controlled Greater Syria, and the United Kingdom occupied the entire oil-producing Iraq; there were also two enclaves, Hou All the areas north of the Hijaz Kingdom and the remaining inland areas governed by Sain are &quot;semi-independent areas&quot;, which are indirectly controlled by Britain and France; while Palestine is an &quot;international condominium area&quot;, which will be jointly controlled by Britain, France and Russia. manage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historians are still debating how this series of &quot;oolong&quot; incidents gradually became a fait accompli with tacit approval. In short, these two conflicting commitment documents signed by the British government with the Arabs and the French respectively will lay the foundation for future turmoil in the Middle East, and thus push Lawrence to a classical tragic personal destiny. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 5, 1915, in the Holy Land of Mecca, Hussein ibn Ali climbed a tower in the palace and fired an old musket at the Turkish fortress in the city . On that day, his two sons Ali and Faisal took the lead, and 1,500 Arab knights fired into the air in Medina. Later, Hussein&#39;s followers launched an attack on Turkish garrison positions in the Hijaz. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hussein issued a declaration to Muslims around the world: publicly condemning the Turkish authorities for &quot;persecuting and massacring Arab nationalists and deviating from the spirit of Islam&quot; and declaring Arab independence from the Ottoman Empire. He proclaimed himself king of the Hijaz kingdom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The famous &quot;Arab Revolt&quot; in the modern history of the Middle East broke out, and the stage with Lawrence as the protagonist officially opened. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The &quot;rabbit&quot; looking for a prophet and a king&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;The heat of the Arabian Peninsula is like an unsheathed sword, leaving us speechless.&quot; October 16, 1916 In the early morning light of the day, when Lawrence accompanied the British Oriental Culture Secretary in Egypt to Jeddah, an important port controlled by Hussein after the uprising, he recorded his feelings at this moment in his diary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before setting foot in Hijaz, he had already designed a new course for the Arab uprising and defined his role - &quot;to find the unknown master soul for the uprising and measure him.&quot; The ability to advance the uprising to the goals I envisioned.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Hussein fired the first shot, the rebels and the Ottoman army entered a stalemate after a month of bloody street fighting. Moreover, the overarching mission of the Holy Guardian of Mecca did not go as expected - sparking a broader national uprising in the Arabian Peninsula, with no response in Syria or other regions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawrence believes that the core of the problem is the lack of a leader. Unlike Western political culture, what the Arab uprisings needed was not a brilliant politician, but a prophet, &quot;not intelligence, not judgment, not political wisdom, but the flame of passion that can ignite the desert.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While his superiors were discussing the details of cooperation with the rebel leaders, Lawrence took the opportunity to carefully observe Hussein&#39;s four sons: the eldest son Ali, the second son Abdullah, and the third son Feisal. Er and their youngest son Zaire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He first met the three princes except Faisal: Abdullah was cheerful by nature, gained weight early because of his greed for pleasure, and his personality was &quot;too cautious, too calm, and too humorous&quot;; the eldest son Ali saw He looks sad and tired, has no obvious ambitions, and is easily influenced by the people around him; as for Zaire, he is only 20 years old and likes to ride horses, wander around and play pranks. In addition, he is of Turkish descent and his appearance is different from Arabs. people. Lawrence concluded that it was difficult for them to become the kind of &quot;armed prophets who triumphed in revolutions in history.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Until Lawrence rode a camel 100 miles through areas controlled by multiple hostile tribes, he met Faisal who was stationed in a desert oasis with another tribe of tribesmen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The first time I saw him, I felt that this was the man I came to the Arabian Peninsula to look for, the man who would bring all the glory to the Arab uprising.&quot; Faisal is thin and tall, with a This strange calmness, the passion when speaking and the iron determination behind the words deeply attracted Lawrence. This was something he had not found in the other three princes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawrence also wandered around his camp for a long time, chatting with the soldiers in fluent Arabic. He found that the more than 6,000 people summoned by Faisal included almost all the tribes in the western Hejaz. Although they had just experienced a defeat, their morale was high and they had unwavering confidence in victory. What united them and inspired them all the time was Faisal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He became more and more determined that Faisal was the &quot;prophet&quot; he was looking for - &quot;Better than we hoped, my goal for this trip has been achieved.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hijaz This trip made Lawrence the first foreigner to go deep into the interior of the Arabian Peninsula to observe the battlefield. When he returned to Yanbu and waited for the ship to return to Cairo, he wrote a 15,000-word report in five days, making two important judgments: first, the British only sent a small number of troops to the Hijaz area; second, the real &quot;prophet&quot; who led the uprising was Fei Sal, not Abdullah as the British were familiar with him. He also pointed out: The only way to cooperate is that the British must accept the Arab way of fighting and adjust their strategies and expectations accordingly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawrence&#39;s report fundamentally changed British policy towards the Arabian Peninsula. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the huge bureaucracy of the British Empire, many smart ideas are buried every day. After writing reports in the Cairo office for nearly two years, Lawrence slowly discovered the rules of the game. He was very good at using bureaucracy and factional infighting to achieve his own goals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After returning from Hijaz, under Lawrence&#39;s dazzling operations, he deliberately guided, bypassed and even destroyed &quot;obstacles&quot; through memos, reports, and reports. In the end, his strategic vision for the Middle East battlefield was realized. It was adopted by all, and received the green light all the way from the top military and political leaders from Egypt to London. Soon, Clayton, director of the British Arab Bureau, informed Lawrence that he would be sent to the Arabian Peninsula to serve as a temporary liaison officer around Faisal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The superiors and colleagues happily sent away this &quot;arrogant, inexperienced brat who pissed off everyone.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/eV9ShS7BygqFQ730yztxT16FkKgaDyLvqICW4kpj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;704&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/eV9ShS7BygqFQ730yztxT16FkKgaDyLvqICW4kpj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259970&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1921, Churchill (front row, center) and Lawrence (second row, fourth from right) during the Cairo Conference&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Becoming a &quot;Son of the Desert&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In December 1916, when Lawrence came to Faisal&#39;s camp again as a British liaison officer, in Faisal At the suggestion of Faisal himself, he put on a pure white silk robe. Throughout the war he lived as much as possible with the warriors of the Arab tribes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A typical day in an Arab tribal camp goes like this: An imam wakes the camp with prayers in the early morning, followed by a long breakfast. Every morning, anyone could come to Faisal to complain, petition, or settle disputes. He spent most of the day eating, drinking tea, and chatting with his staff and tribal leaders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawrence himself had always had a reputation for being impatient and disciplinarian, but he realized that these long, aimless chats were exactly how Arabs dealt with war and peace. Faisal used this as a glue to unite and maintain these loose tribes and clans around him. During the entire battle, he also served as a mediator between the various tribes, listening, making suggestions, cajoling when necessary, and often spending his own money to reconcile the two parties with interest disputes as soon as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nearly all British military advisers sent to the Hijaz since the uprising had expressed contempt for the Arabs&#39; fighting prowess. Lawrence agreed, but after fighting with them, he came to an important point: the Arabs cannot be measured by European war standards, and it is also difficult to organize and train them into European-style combat forces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What they are really good at is guerrilla warfare. In addition, they have a good understanding of the geographical environment and are very mobile. In war, when the strength and weapons and equipment are obviously inferior to that of the enemy, the weaker party should not engage the opponent head-on, but should &quot;float around like air.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the first day of the uprising, both Hussein and his followers, and the British, had made capturing Medina, the second holiest city in Islam, their main goal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Lawrence believed that the correct strategy was to abandon the heavily fortified Medina and let the Ottoman army stay there almost indefinitely. Let them barely maintain their supply lines and be unable to retreat or attack. This was equivalent to The rebels were captured. Eventually, he convinced the rebels to shift their strategic focus to harassing and destroying areas along the Hejaz Railway. This forced the Turkish army to send heavy troops to defend the railway and at the same time undertake ongoing maintenance work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Arab Revolt, the new goals and new strategies formulated by Lawrence reversed the situation, made the strikes more effective, and significantly reduced casualties. During the entire &quot;World War I&quot;, the Arab rebel forces continued to launch guerrilla warfare, which effectively delayed the actions of the Ottoman army and helped the Allies finally defeat the Ottoman Empire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/RU2VlcM0z8CZJ9I6semM5HpKZiTMLQynW01DmZsl.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;769&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/RU2VlcM0z8CZJ9I6semM5HpKZiTMLQynW01DmZsl.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259976&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Lawrence (left) and American traveler and journalist Lowell Thomas in Arabia&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Become a legend - capture Aqaba&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Gulf of Aqaba is located east of the Sinai Peninsula and west of the Arabian continent. It is a bay in the northern part of the Red Sea. The port of Aqaba is at its northern end. Judging from the plan map, it is an ideal staging area for attacking southern Palestine from Egypt. Sixty miles to the east is the lifeline of the Ottoman army on the Arabian Peninsula - the Hejaz Railway. In all future Middle East wars, this place will be a strategic location for offensive and defensive operations between Afghanistan and Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1914, when Lawrence was an archaeologist at the British Museum, he conducted an expedition in the Gulf of Aqaba. From the port of Aqaba to the interior, there are steep mountains that rise all the way, and then there is the inland desert. The only access inland from the port of Aqaba was through a canyon, along which the Ottomans built a network of blockhouses and trenches. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Britain and France have their own calculations on how to deal with this obviously strategically important Red Sea port. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of January 1917, with Lawrence&#39;s contact and the cooperation of the British army, Faisal led his tribal army to seize Vodikh, an important port located in the north-central part of the Red Sea. French representatives began to lobby the British to send troops to attack and control Aqaba, so that the right wing could protect the British Egyptian Expeditionary Force in the Palestinian campaign launched in January of that year. Another more secret motive was to suppress the raging Arab uprising within the Hijaz territory, command them to coordinate actions as needed, and threaten them with a withdrawal of arms and gold support if they dissatisfied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawrence had always opposed Faisal&#39;s plan to attack Aqaba. He knew the Allied Powers&#39; calculations: if the Arabs only cooperated with the British and French troops&#39; offensive, Aqaba would become their &quot;death trap&quot; and they would end up empty-handed. For this reason, he did not hesitate to risk &quot;treason&quot; and revealed the British-French secret agreement to Faisal in February 1917. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, if the Arabs themselves control this northernmost port on the Red Sea, once the rebels move north to fight in Syria, the supply line can be greatly shortened from the original 300 miles to 60 miles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 1917, his boss Clayton sent Lawrence a secret order from Cairo: Do ​​not let Arabs appear in Aqaba. He understood the subtext - Clayton was even more explicit in a letter to a general: given the importance of Aqaba to Egypt&#39;s defense, the British must firmly control the seaport city after the war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April of that year, when Lawrence was interrogating a dozen Turkish prisoners of war sent by the British army, he received new information: The garrison in Aqaba had just changed, and the number rarely exceeded 100, and the number of prisoners from Aqaba was small. There are only 200 Turkish troops stationed on the road between Kaba and Ma&#39;an Town, the Hejaz railway hub in the interior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawrence quickly made a bold and risky decision - before the British and French troops invaded Aqaba, he united various desert tribes to convene an Arab armed force, and then crossed the mountains and ridges at lightning speed, and started from the inland highway. The last town of Ma&#39;an captured the port of Aqaba. Through this victory fought for by the Arabs themselves, the influence of European powers in the region was minimized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This was also Lawrence&#39;s boldest and most famous military action in the &quot;World War I&quot;. He used understatement to excuse other British officers around him and his superiors in Cairo, &quot;So, regardless of orders or not, I went my own way.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 7, 1917, Lawrence and 45 desert warriors set out from Vodijh, carrying gold coins worth 20,000 pounds and some rifles, riding camels into the Huer Desert in the northeastern interior, planning to recruit troops from the Hovitat tribe deep in the desert. He also encouraged the Syrian tribes to serve as a frontline for the rebels to move north and liberate Syria. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They stopped at the Wadi Sirhan oasis as they entered Syria. More and more tribal representatives came to discuss alliances with the rebels and join the Arab independence cause. As Lawrence was entertained with round after round of tribal feasts, his guilt grew. He knew he was deceiving—after victory, the Allies would inevitably betray the Arabs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an extremely complex and painful state of mind, he made a suicidal adventure - traveling north to Syria alone, detouring 400 miles through enemy territory, reaching as far north as Lebanon and the suburbs of Damascus, where he secretly met and fought for Potential allies of the uprising include tribal leaders and urban Arab nationalists. At that time, Damascus was the seat of the joint headquarters of the Ottoman and German armies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a desert oasis, he met the highly prestigious Emir (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, Script_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;A title of nobility in the Arab world&lt;/span >;) Nuri Sharaang. When the old chief living deep in the desert took out a bunch of copies of conflicting documents and asked him which British promise he should believe, Lawrence had no choice but to suggest choosing the one with the closest date. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The old chief was persuaded, and Lawrence felt ashamed. &quot;I used lies to gain a reputation for myself and became the undisputed leader of the fraud group.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawrence said that he had truly woken up. , with the motivation to live. &quot;I vow to spare no effort until we bring the final victory to the Arabs, respect the demands of the Arabs, and negotiate a fair and reasonable solution. Only by saving our lives in the troubled times in front of us can we compete with others at the future negotiation table. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The swamp-like situation often inspires Lawrence&#39;s most incredible courage, resourcefulness and endurance. The legendary battle during World War I - the capture of Aqaba - took place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 18, 1917, Lawrence and the &quot;Legendary Desert Warrior&quot; Oda Abu Tai set out from Wadi Sirhan with 500 camel cavalry recruited and headed southwest. When they arrived at Bell, they found the footprints traced by the Ottoman army - all the most important water wells in the desert march had been blown up, and they had guessed that the rebel army&#39;s goal was Aqaba. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawrence then commanded and led the Arabs to set up a divine formation. As early as more than ten days ago, he had laid the groundwork when he went north to Syria, leading a local squad to bomb the Destroyed a small bridge on the Hejaz Railway north of Damascus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On June 21, he led 100 soldiers to Amman on the railway 150 miles north, and quickly destroyed a railway culvert and then returned quickly. In the south of Syria, the insurgents launched a series of guerrilla warfare. This made the Turkish troops unable to find the law at all, and had to diversify their troops and follow them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A good news came: a team they sent a few days ago had just captured and destroyed the Turkish military base, Fuvila, and the road from the inland to Avasaka was basically basically. Open. When they hurriedly bypassed Ma&#39;an Town and rushed to Aikeha, there was news of bad news: On the morning of the same day, about 500 Ottoman soldiers rushed to Fvira to increase their troops. at. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After thinking about it, Lawrence made a decision: must actively find and annihilate Ottoman reinforcements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; During the dawn on July 2, in a narrow road south of Fvira, they found an enemy who was sleeping. After cruel killing, they finally killed 300 people and 160 captives. . However, when the prisoners of war revealed that Ma Anzhen defended the emptiness, the tribal warriors from the bandits shouted, and wanted to take the opportunity to loot the rich transportation hub. Lawrence tried to persuade and promised to give them more compensation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When they moved west along the highway, they passed through the empty Turkish fortress and trenches -this proves that Lawrence has not been recognized by the boss. &quot; We will attack from the inland. In all their large defensive industries, there is no trenches and no posts are facing inland. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; After two days of stalemate, the troops led by Lawrence are almost not bloodless blades. The ground won the port of Yakha. The next day, he went to Egypt again, traveled through the camel through the 150 -mile desert to the Suez Canal, and informed the British to quickly add reinforcements and transport food and other supplies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On July 10, 1917, Lawrence, who had been &quot;missing&quot; for more than two months, wore a sloppy Arabic robe and suddenly appeared in the Cairo office of the British intelligence agency. Within a few days, his heroic deeds spread in the senior management of Egypt and London. As the Western Front war was unfavorable and the French army was changing, the victory of the British in the Middle East battlefield was particularly exciting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For the general public, this is a legend of lonely heroes that can arouse endless romantic imagination -a young, blue -eyed British officer wearing a alien robe, riding a camel, and a single shot deep into the horse. In the hinterland of the enemy, secrets to meet and strive for potential conspirators, walking around in the middle of the people who want to be smoked, they may be sold and executed at any time. Then, the hero led the tribal warriors, who made a conspiracy and won a series of incredible victory with less victory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The British Egyptian commander Wengate proposed to the senior management of London: Lawrence awarded the highest military honor in Britain -Victoria Cross. Soon, he was promoted to colonel and nominated the third -class knight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This time, the unruly Lawrence accepted humblely -official recognition and honor can also become a powerful tool to affect high -level decision -making to achieve his in order to achieve his incense The vows from the desert: break through the &quot;red line&quot; set up by the French, burns the war of war to Syria, and help the British help the Arabs to liberate Syria. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Standing in front of Edmond Allenbi, commander -in -chief of the new Egyptian Expeditionary Army, he depicts a exciting situation and future prospects. Immediately, Allen took a telegram filled with optimistic emotions to the Empire Chief of Staff William Robertson. In the end, the general coordination of the western line was promised to add 50,000 troops to the Middle East for the offensive of the Palestinian battlefield. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This is a key turning point in the Arabic uprising. It is Lawrence who leveraged the gear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Under the requirements of the senior management, the &quot;popular fried chicken&quot; wrote a summary of the experience of the reference of overseas combat officers, which is for the Article 27 Suggestion. His most important experience is: abandoning the habit of the British and letting himself be completely immersed in the local environment. He must be familiar with &quot;local families, clan and tribes, friends and enemies, wells, hills and roads.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2006, the United States launched military operations on Iraq, and the US commander -in -chief David Peterreus ordered senior officers to read the &quot;27th suggestion&quot; to learn how to win Iraq from Lawrence. People&#39;s hearts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/29gobfcycabnkcwvtvyn6jtzdwoovshoucg6i.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; widt h = &quot;717&quot; height = &quot;960&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/29gobfcycabnkcwvtvyn6jtzdwoovshoucg6i.jpg&quot; data- &quot;>; &lt;259974&quot;>; &lt;/&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>; Lawrence &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; (visual China/picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;/p>; &lt;/p>; Heroes &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; From October 1917, some people close to Lawrence found that he was in a quiet state of depression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Since the British liaison officer who served as the Arabic uprising, he has always lived a highly intense life, like a great actor who has continued to perform &quot;thrilling performances&quot;. This is a huge consumption in intelligence, physical strength, and spirit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The main reason is the increasingly upgraded killing. In &quot;Wisdom Seven Pillars&quot;, he recorded a person for the first time, and then he fell ill. At first, he led the Arabs to fight guerrilla warfare to avoid killing innocent. During an ambush, they grabbed a shepherd boy who hit them. Lawrence tied him to the tree to prevent him from giving a ventilation to the Turkish army. Before the battle was ended, he released him. As the war became more and more nervous and cruel, he couldn&#39;t care much. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Wait until the end of the Battle of the Fvila Canyon in the Battle of Aqababa, he described the corpses of hundreds of Turkish soldiers who saw hundreds of clothes in the moonlight in the moonlight. Going up to the young, fair, and quiet, it is compassionate, &quot;So I put all of them neatly, one by one. I am also exhausted and eager to become one of these tranquil people, rather than returning to the valley high. The group of thugs who did not have peace, noisy, and painful pains for a while. Those people are still fighting for loot. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; In the face of increasingly frequent killings, he seems to be more and more indifferent, more and more increasingly indifferent. The more indifferent. But in the letter to Oxford&#39;s close friends, he poured: &quot;I hope that the nightmare is over, I can wake up and live again. Killing, killing Turkey is really terrible.&quot; Times, if you can, you have to do it a few hundred times &quot;,&quot; I won&#39;t be able to support it in this game. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Boss Cryon has noticed this most powerful mental state He acknowledged that he was very worried about Lawrence&#39;s state. &quot;We will withdraw him as soon as possible, and don&#39;t continue to let him risk, but the time has not yet arrived, because he still needs him.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; November 1917 1917 In order to match the Egyptian expeditionary army&#39;s offensive against Palestine, Lawrence took a guard to investigate the situation near the Railway hub in Syria, and he was arrested by an Ottoman troops and was then detained to the local governor. Lawrence lied that he was a civilian of a mountain nation in Caucasus. This nation is known for its fair skin, light eyes, and is exempted from military service. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Later, the most horrible scene in his entire memoir. Lawrence used the entire five -page to describe the details he suffered -he was first applied by the Governor of Turkey to the violence of the bloody flavor. Invasion; then beaten by four soldiers, and then repeatedly kicked by the torture officer; he was dragged back to the governor&#39;s room. Later he was thrown in a courtyard, and an Armenian came over to create and bandage him. This group of people went away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When it was light, Lawrence was awake and walked out of the town. With the help of a camel merchant, he found his companion and then told a &quot;happy story of escape the enemy&#39;s palm through bribery and strategies&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; People discovered: After the return of Dra, some things on Lawrence have changed, and he is more arrogant and indifferent. Since then, the bold man in the past organized a 50 -person elite guard for himself, always with him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 10 months later, when he led the Arab soldier to return to this railway town again, he ordered a bloody massacre with the flame of revenge. More than 4,000 people were killed. Thahalska. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The mental trauma left by the Drac to Lawrence is permanent- &quot;World War I&quot; ended, and after the end of the War, Mrs. Xiao Bernard, who was regarded as a confession priest, he poured into his inner quilt. After the sense of stains and strong self -aversion, after &quot;that thing&quot;, he vowed to &quot;abandon the decent life.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/v7QS17Ixa1tkbmuvrygpq9jt1yskqDuux.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; widt h = &quot;960&quot; height = &quot;747&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/v7qs17ixa1tkbmuvrygpq9jt1yskq -uux.jpg&quot; data-key = &quot;259972&quot;>; &lt;/&lt;/&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>; 1962 movie&quot; Lawrence of Arabia &quot;stills &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; (Visual China/Figure) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; The more entangled the more chaotic: Bellford Declaration, Weitzman and Lawrence &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In November 1917, the British Egypt Expeditionary Force successfully broke through the Osman army&#39;s defense line and captured the Palestinian region. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At this time, Lawrence has learned that a news that will make the future situation becomes more and more chaotic: British government cabinets have initially passed the support of Jewish Reinstateists to establish a &quot;national homeland&quot; in Palestine at the end of October. The Bellford Declaration &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Zionism&quot;, which is generally called &quot;Jewish stateism&quot; in my country, is a trend of Jewish nationalism. Jewish country, revive the Jewish nation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; By the end of the 19th century, after a new round of anti -Jewie wave in Europe appeared in Europe, the Utah Austrian reporter Shi Orto Hitzel proposed the theory and program of modern Jewish stateism, and held in 1897 The first Zianist Congress created the World Zianist Organization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At the end of 1916, the new British Prime Minister David David Laor George took office. Mum Witzman has a relationship. In addition to religious sympathy, this also has the consideration of realistic politics: After the &quot;World War I&quot; fell into a deadlocked, both the battle between the war aware of the widespread influence of the Jewish re -state and hoped to get their help; The territory of the Ottoman Empire could not promise too much. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On October 31, 1917, the British government cabinet passed supportive resolutions, followed by the Bellford Declaration: support the establishment of the Jewish &quot;nation&#39;s home&quot; in Palestinian, The condition is not to harm the rights of local ethnic groups, except for political rights. At that time, Palestine was still the territory of the Ottoman Empire, and Jews were just local ethnic minorities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The Bellford Declaration is an important document in the Middle East policy of the British Empire and an important document in the history of the founding of Israel. It contributed to the establishment of Palestine&#39;s hosting land, which later became the territory of Israel and Palestine, so declarations were also regarded as one of the reasons that caused Palestine&#39;s conflict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; As early as 8 months ago, Lawrence published an analysis of the status quo of Syria in the Arab Public Press. He talked about the causes of the area that caused the region, including various contradictions between the tribe, nation, and religion, and any foreigner attempting to strengthen his will to Syria, and will face many challenges. Lawrence also pointed out that southern Palestine has a great hatred for the Jewish recovery movement, including Muslims and Christians. Recently, the situation has exacerbated this natural hatred. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In fact, this article was written two years ago, and Lawrence fully foreshadowed the countless turmoil, conflict and anxiety in the Middle East in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In February 1918, this article caused a special interest in the United States named William Yale in the Middle East. The young former American oil giant employee wanted to let his country participate in the Middle East affairs, so he went to visit Lawrence and wanted to know more about information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; During the meeting, Lawrence could not be reserved, and even revealed the Military Observation goals of the Arabic uprising. He also predicted the consequences of the Bellford Declaration: &quot;If a Jewish country is established in Palestine, it can only be established through force and maintains through force through force.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;/p>; &lt;/p>; P>; Some biography author analyzes: Lawrence is interested in it. He wants to influence and guide the US government that has been joined by Yale and has recently adopted the policies that he recognized and has for Syria and Palestine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, President Wilson is nothing to do at the Paris in 1919. Until the Second World War, the United States completely replaced Britain to become the number one hegemon in the world, and at the same time took over its power in the Middle East, becoming the most solid ally after the founding of modern Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The announcement of the Bellford Declaration, together with the exposed &quot;Symbs-Pasco Agreement&quot;, ignited the fire of anger in the Arab world. In Cairo, the Muslims of the Egyptian Muslims have erupted for group protests. Exiles of Syria are also increasingly worried that a Jewish country will be imposed to Palestine in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; King Hussein, the largest opponent in the Arabian Peninsula, to launch a new round of public opinion attacks. Ibn Saudi Arabia comes from the Saudi family in the Inner region, representing the Islamic retro power -Wakahabi sect. He has always been ambitious to unify the Arabian Peninsula. He announced to the outside world that King Hussein was the puppet of Western Christianity. But in fact, he himself also relies on the support of the British colonial branch of the British Empire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The strong rebound of the Arab world has made Britain disturbed. They put pressure on Hussein and asked him to publicize public support. Clayton asked Lawrence to do persuasion from Fersell, although Lawrence had always opposed the agreement between the British government and Jews. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In March 1918, accompanied by the British, the &quot;Jewish State Council&quot; led by Weitzman&#39;s team visited the Egyptian and Palestine regions. In Egypt, he launched a charming offensive to the British and exile Syrians, and repeatedly expressed the goodwill of Jewish recurrence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On June 4th of that year, Weitzman personally visited Fasal in Avaphaw. The atmosphere of the meeting was very harmonious, and Witzmann even brought Arabic headscarves; Festa avoided any substantial commitments and said that all the right to decide was with his father. Lawrence made excuses to avoid it, no matter how his boss calls for pressure. He has determined that the harmony of the British imposed will only make Fasal and Lao Hussein a greater opposition in the Arab world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In Egypt 10 days later, he still saw Weitzman. The key to the Jewish political leader of the world: whether the Arab uprising leader can achieve an understanding is that the little British officer of the baby face is. After the master&#39;s tricks, he also gave birth to Xiang Xiang -Lawrence also admired Weitzman&#39;s Linglong wrist. On the one hand, he successfully eliminated the Arabs&#39; concerns, and inspired the Jewish fighting spirit with another set of words. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Two smart people reached a consensus -if the Jews want to establish a &quot;national home&quot; in Palestine, they must first let the British win this war, which means that they should support first to support first Arab uprising. Weitzman also proactively proposed a &quot;support&quot; that is quite seductive: allowing the International Jewish Nationalist Movement Organization to fund Arab independence, including funds and weapons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The charm of Weitzman&#39;s charm has achieved results. He persuaded most British officials who were worried about Palestine in the future because of the Bellford Declaration, and convinced them that in Palestine, the Jewish community could harmonize The most populous Arabs live in politics and economy in harmony with each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; What makes the boss happy is that Lawrence seems to be no longer so resistant to the Jewish recurrence movement. But he was not so naive. In a secret report, he sharply pointed out the real vision of the Jewish leader- &quot;After 50 years, the Jews will fully control Palestine, and the current goal is to control Palestine under the guise of Britain.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; In the 1930s, after Hitler came to power in Germany, the Nazi party performed a terrible racial massacre on the Jews, destroying most of the European Jewish groups. As a result, the Jewish nationalist movement rose high and reached its peak in 1948. On May 14th of that year, modern Israel was formally established, and Weitzman was the first president. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; All these are 20 years earlier than Lawrence. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Futuring the last fight &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In July 1918, Lawrence began to plan the long -delayed Arab uprising army to fight in Syria north. With the development of the situation, he is more clear about the truth: Only in the area where the Arabs themselves are liberated can their independence be guaranteed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Under the promotion of Lawrence, the Amman and Jordan River gathered a hybrid force consisting of the Arab tribe armed, Arab Northern Army soldiers, British -French advisers and special artillery, armored vehicle units. Thousands of people. There are important uprising leaders at the scene: Ferser, Oda, and the main tribal chiefs, including Salad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the eve of the war, there was a heartbreaking bad news -Lawrence&#39;s partner and lover of Lawrence during the Karkimish period, the Syrian teenager with a bright smile died in a raging northern Syria. Typhoid epidemic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the title page of &quot;Smart Seven Pillars&quot;, he wrote a love poem dedicated to Dahom: &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot; I love you, so I will put this troops in my hands/I write down my wish in the starry sky and win the freedom for you .../When I drive in, your eyes will be shining .../You The smile of the smile (Death) was jealous from sorrow, left me, took you away, and imprisoned his deadly ghost. &quot;&lt;/Span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For Lawrence, to Dahom’s Love is his original motivation to win freedom and independence for the Arabs. When the dream is about to be realized, the lover has passed, and a huge pain and void overwhelm him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; War continues. In September 1918, Lawrence was ordered from the British Command: let the Arabs completely cut off the railway line south of Drah, but he could not rush north to Malaysia to cooperate with the British army on the north on the west bank of the Jordan River. They also conveyed their hints to Fasal: If the Arabs are loyal at this critical time, they will get good compensation, and even allow him to establish a government in Damascus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After receiving the government&#39;s verbal guarantee, Lawrence leaders in Dila and launched the most fierce attack on the Hanzhi Railway. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On September 27, the village and town named Thazos, which left Lawrence near Dracus, and he and the Arab Forces saw an atrocities left by the League of Legion that retreated. : There are incomplete bodies everywhere, while girls and women are naked with blood stains, obviously being raped; on a short wall, a naked pregnant woman penetrated by a bayonet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Lawrence then ordered: Do not accept any captives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The massacre went all night and continued until the next day. A total of more than 4,000 captured alliance soldiers died of the killing, which was the famous &quot;Thaphos massacred&quot; for the &quot;World War I&quot;. In the early morning of the next day, Lawrence entered Drah Town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A British general rushed here later. He witnessed Turkish patients who were dirty, brutal and cruel. Ordinary civilized people can&#39;t stand such a tragic scene. &quot; When he complained to Lawrence, Lawrence told him calmly and gentle: This is the &quot;concept of war&quot; by the Arabs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After the battle of Drah, the Ottoman army has collapsed across the board. General Allen made a warm congratulatory letter to Fasal: &quot;I express my wish to His Royal Highness and my sincere congratulations on your great achievements ... thanks to our joint efforts, the Turkish Army is now collapsed throughout the board. &quot;He then ordered: left the honor to the Damascus to Fergaar&#39;s army. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On October 3, 1918, at the Damascus Victoria Hotel, British Commander Allenbi and Fisal met. Lawrence acts as a translation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; General Allen announced that: Arabs, as the status of participating countries, have been recognized by the cooperative country; on the independence of Syrian, Fergar has no choice. As the representative of King Hussein, &quot;will have the jurisdiction of Syria&quot;, but &quot;with French guidance and financial support&quot;, and his jurisdiction is &quot;limited to the Mainland of Syria&quot;, excluding Palestine and Lebanon; France will give it to Fergaal is equipped with a liaison officer who will work with Lawrence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Lawrence and Fasal were stunned. At the beginning of Fasal, Fasal was fiercely opposed, but under the pressure of Allen, he finally had to yield. In tiredness and disappointment, Lawrence turned against the general. The general finally agreed. The next day, he left Damascus. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; The defeat on the negotiating table &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In December 1918, before the Paris peace conference was held, the British Prime Minister Laohe George and French Prime Minister George Creeng The Middle East vision reached consensus: the British control Mesopotamia and Palestine; the French have the right to deal with Syria. In addition to the basic structure of the &quot;Sicks-Portrait Agreement&quot;, they have greatly surpassed it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At the Paris, Lawrence, wearing the Arabic robe as a consultant to Ferser, continued to run for the independent career of Arab, participating in speeches and negotiations as translations, organizing press conferences and guiding newspapers. This is an unobstructed impression on the well -known historian of the conference venue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At that time, the annoying Clemurisha went to the British delegation to sue Lawrence and called the young man to reprimand in person. French Prime Minister with a nickname &quot;Tiger&quot; asked: &quot;Colonel Lawrence, do you know that France has benefits in Syria since the Crusades&#39; East Expedition?&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Lawrence replied: &quot;Yes. I know. . But the Syrian defeated the Crusaders, and we would never forget this. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Kermenguan was dumb. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;This is a tortured soul. I think Lawrence had realized that although he had achieved a lot of success in Arabic careers, he still did not win.&quot; . &quot;This makes Lawrence very distressed, but the pain does not eliminate his sense of humor. He is a bit great and a bit naughty.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; British and French blending, destroying Lawrence&#39;s ideal of vowing for it-- —The national independence. For the adults of the British Empire, &quot;Hero Lawrence&quot; has become a trouble. In a memorandum, they call it &quot;harmful influence&quot; and &quot;to a large extent is the source of our trouble with France on the Syrian issue.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Lawrence was eventually deprived of the qualifications to participate in the Paris peace conference, and was banned from assisting Ferra at the meeting. He lost. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, he still makes a great effort. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the eve of Paris in December 1918, under the promotion of him, Fasal, as representatives of the Arab world, and the leader of the Jewish Rehabilitation Movement, Weitzman formulated a joint statement to announce the willingness to cooperate between the two parties. . Among them, the fourth is: &quot;All necessary measures should be taken to encourage and promote a large -scale immigration to Palestine&quot;, and then a key conditional sentence -this agreement &quot;is valid in the situation of independence in Syria; Conditions are completely invalid. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; At that time, Fasal also talked friendlyly about the&quot; family relationship and ancient bond &quot;between the Arabs and Jews. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the Palestinian region, the Arabs and Jewish recovered between the water and fire also joined hands to build a joint country of the Arab-Jewish. However, does Lawrence&#39;s efforts really have realistic possibilities? ——If he succeeded in 1918, would an independent Pan -Arab country be born because of this? If history happened like the agreement between Fersea and Weitzmann, would Ayi/Palestine get along with each other in harmony with each other? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; As a descendant separated by Lawrence for a century, I am hard to be optimistic -looking at the modern history of the Middle East, every time the dawn of reconciliation will have extreme forces to launch targeted assassination and destruction. On the list of victims, there are Hussein second son, the first king of Jordan, Abdullah, Egyptian President Sadat, promoting the Israeli Prime Minister Laibin, who is &quot;exchanged by land&quot; ... &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Modern The birth of the Middle East — Defining the territory and holding the king &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; At the Paris peace conference in the fall of 1919, after losing Lawrence&#39;s help, Fasal had to accept the conditions given by the French. When he returned to Damascus, he found himself condemned traitors to betray the motherland to European imperialism. Instead of using the people&#39;s anger, he torn an agreement with the French in 1920 and launched a palace coup to stand himself as the Great Syrian king. In April of the same year, Syria was hosted to France. In July, France won in the Battle of Mersellon and Fasal was exile in the UK. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At this point, history has moved towards another trajectory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; There is no good day to control France in Syria -Abdullah launched a sustainable and fierce attack on them from Jordan. There are more headaches for the British: in the Palestinian region, the conflict between the Palestinians and the Jewish settlers continues to upgrade; in the Mesopotamia, anti -British uprising rises, and bleeding and confrontation are everywhere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 1920, former Navy Minister Winston Churchill returned, and then transferred to the colonial minister in Laogi George&#39;s cabinet. He invited Lawrence, who was beaten into the Leng Palace, and asked him to serve as the head of the Middle East Department of Affairs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The discouraged Lawrence pushed that he was busy writing memoirs and no more interest in politics. Churchill repeatedly guaranteed that at the upcoming Cairo meeting, he was granted almost completely free of power to help Britain redefine the part of the British in the Middle East chessboard. Lawrence agreed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to his biography author, he revealed that the Cairo meeting in March 1921 just walked a pass. Before the meeting, he &quot;not only determined what issues will be reviewed by the meeting, but also determined that they will be determined. What kind of resolution is achieved. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the resolution, Britain handed over the two former Ottoman territory it controlled to the Hashim family. The two sides agreed: Prince Fisal became the king of the new country of Mesopotamia, the kingdom of Iraq; his elder brother Prince Abdullah ruled the East Jordan River and a new country composed of some Palestinian, that is, today&#39;s Jordan Kingdom . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This two ideas that Lawrence has been struggling for it: First of all, the Arabs must obtain control of their land. Secondly, the Arabs who have been given this kind of power are members of the Hardin family: King Hussein and his sons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Lawrence&#39;s efforts brought a period of peace to the Middle East, and some of them also fulfilled his promise to the Arabs when the uprising. It is generally believed that at the Cairo conference in 1921, Lawrence&#39;s role was greater than Churchill -eventually, he really became the one in the Middle East to designate the territory and support the king. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the Anatolia region, former Osman general Mustafa Kellyr led the Turkish nationalist to fight all the people attempts. In 1923, he signed a treaty with the Xiexiang to determine the territory of modern Turkey. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the south, King Hussein, the King of Han Zhi, refused to accept the real politics of the Middle East, even if Lawrence was unable to persuade. His stubbornness and repeated impermanence eventually bored the British government. The old opponent Ibn Saudi used this contradiction and led the Vahabi soldiers to approach Macga in 1924. Under the betrayal of the people, Hussein refuated in Cyprus, and then gathered in the New Jordanian capital Amman and the second son Abdullah. In June 1931, Hussein died and buried in Jerusalem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After the winner Ibn Saudi swallowed Hanzhi, he established Saudi Arabian kingdom. In 1927, the British announced their independence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After a brief peace, the new turmoil began again. In 1946, the French were eventually forced to abandon the Greater Syria, but divided a new country -Lebanon. In 1958, the Iraqi nationalist launched a military coup and overthrew the pro -British regime. Fasal&#39;s only son Fasal II was executed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the 1960s, the era of Western colonialism ended. Because of 60 % of oil resources around the world, the Middle East is like being cursed, and it continues to become the most uneasy corner in geopolitics. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &quot;When the death is catching me&quot; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In 1921, when Lawrence played for Churchill, he wrote to a friend and said, &quot;The Arabs are like me like me. A page I turned over, the sequel is something I hate. &quot; After the World War I, he has always suffered from severe trauma stress disorder (PTSD), constantly disturbed by nightmares, caught severe depression many times, and even thought of suicide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Since 1920, Lawrence rewritten autobiography based on notes and memories to complete the war memoir &quot;Wisdom Seven Pillars&quot;. He printed 8 copies with his hand and gave his friends. Later, at the strong request of the public, he made compromises. In 1926, he published an abuse version of the book, and at the same time released the popular version of &quot;Uprising in the Desert&quot;, which achieved market success. Lawrence donated all the taxes to charity organization and refused to make a lifetime reprint &quot;Wisdom Seven Pillars&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He can no longer return to the life of a scholar. In 1922, after finishing his position in the British Government&#39;s colonial department, he picked up John Huga Ross and joined the Royal Air Force as an ordinary soldier, but was soon discovered by the press. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He was renamed Thomas Edward Xiao, and continued to serve in the army to avoid the newspaper and public who pursued him. In the last ten years of life, he lived a life of lingering, and pushed away the invitation of friends with various excuses, even the closest friend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Fergal, who became the king of Iraq, and Lawrence later saw it twice. In 1925, in the face of the life and death of life and death, Lawrence was at a loss, and the two were speechless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When Ferser visited the UK in 1933, he proposed to see Lawrence again. Lawrence was negative. Later, Ferobar had to use the military order to see the &quot;Soldiers Xiao&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On May 13, 1935, Lawrence rode a motorcycle and sent a telegram to the Bavinton military camp. On the way back, a traffic accident was encountered. Six days after the army hospital, died in the early morning of May 19 at the age of 46. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The clouds of &quot;World War II&quot; approached, and Churchill, who was trapped in the &quot;confused years&quot;, came to mourn, and wrote a period of mourning that a politician had real resonance: &quot;In my eyes, he is the greatest figure in our time. One ...

The remains are suspected by the police to be the six Chinese citizens who were kidnapped on October 30: including Mr. Zeng and his wife who are presidents of local Chinese charity organizations in the Philippines, brother Zeng and his wife, and brother Zeng’s teenage son. son, and one person remains unidentified. On November 28, the Philippine police confirmed the identities of four corpses, including Mr. Zeng’s two brothers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, vicious cases involving overseas Chinese have occurred in some overseas countries: In May 2023, a Chinese couple died naked in a Bali hotel; in 2023, a Chinese student was murdered in Thailand on &quot;3·31&quot;... …In addition to these brutal cases, the criminal system of the warlords in northern Myanmar is basically tailor-made for the Chinese people. The number of Chinese people they have killed and the seriousness of their crimes are really too numerous to describe. Recently, the &quot;Ming Family&quot; in northern Myanmar, which specializes in telecommunications fraud, has reached the end of its rope and is about to be destroyed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the country&#39;s economic development, foreign economic, trade and cultural exchanges have increased, and Chinese people at home and abroad have more and more interactions with the world. Opportunities are always accompanied by challenges, and contradictions, conflicts, and dangers are everywhere. How to ensure one&#39;s personal and property safety, as well as legal rights, has become increasingly important. Examples of self-security and collective security for overseas Chinese can be found in the Korean community living in North America and the Jewish community scattered around the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;South Korea has a small population, and even fewer people live in the world. However, a small number of Korean immigrants (mainly immigrants from South Korea) became a bright spot in the &quot;Los Angeles Riots&quot; in 1992: After the U.S. police temporarily gave up protecting communities of color, a small number of Korean immigrants united and armed themselves for self-defense , took up arms to defend the community, resisting the onslaught of thugs, and held on until the National Guard entered the city to quell the violence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For decades, Koreans have deeply felt the importance of external unity. Their overseas immigrants have strengthened internal unity, taking advantage of North American citizens&#39; gun-carrying laws to arm themselves for self-defense and strengthen their martial spirit. Therefore, even though the 1.65 million Korean immigrants only account for 0.5% of the U.S. population, North American residents know that Koreans are not easy to mess with and they dare to use guns in critical moments. Therefore, the thugs of the &quot;Los Angeles Riots&quot; were unable to capture the strongholds held by Korean armed forces, so they looted Chinese stores because the Chinese generally lacked the ability to defend themselves at the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before World War II, the Jewish community was known for being disunited, disorganized, shrewd and philanthropic, and gentle and cowardly. It is said that there are 12 branches of Judaism since ancient times. There are so many factions and small groups below. The Jews who run banks are greedy for money and are unwilling to help others. Therefore, few people are willing to help them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to better integrate into European society, the Jews not only accepted many Western living habits, but also tried to avoid confrontation when they had conflicts with the indigenous peoples. Therefore, various European ethnic groups have long scorned the military value of the Jews. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During World War II, the Holocaust in Nazi Germany nearly annihilated European Jewry, which changed the spirit, character, and psychology of some Jews. After the war, some Jews reached several consensuses:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, they must build their own country and make it strong, rather than just being nomads in the world. When conflicts involving the Jewish community occur again, it cannot only rely on money, but also on the state. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, it is still necessary to maintain the simultaneous existence of Jews in various parts of the world to spread the risks of survival in case one country is defeated and the entire race is annihilated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, money alone is not enough. To survive, you must have the ability to defend yourself. The two words &quot;wealth and strength&quot; are indispensable. If we are not rich, we cannot afford advanced weapons and equipment and cannot build a strong army, so we cannot be strong; if we are not strong, we cannot maintain wealth for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a result, Jews have self-defense groups in many communities around the world. Especially in North America, we make full use of local laws and policies to conduct paramilitary training and have a considerable number of foreign reserve soldiers. On October 7, 2023, just hours after the war in Gaza broke out, a large number of Jewish young people from North America and Australia flew to Israel to join the war, with a total number of tens of thousands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through arduous efforts, the Jews have changed to a certain extent the customs of their ethnic group, which were previously fragmented, fighting among themselves, and trying to undermine each other (but there is still a clear distinction between their modern factions and the &quot;ultra-Orthodox&quot;). It not only engages in &quot;hiding troops among the people&quot; around the world, but also forms an underground intelligence network connecting the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After all, Israel is a miniature country with a population of only a few million, and its intelligence agency &quot;Mossad&quot; does not have sufficient funds (like the CIA). Especially in the early stages of construction and development, it can be said that there is little money to be had, and even poverty can lead to poverty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1960, the Nazi war criminal Eichmann was captured; in the 1970s, the &quot;Black September&quot; terrorist organization was hunted around the world. &quot;Mossad&quot; can only send out a small range of troops, and the budget is tight. Each person only has a few dollars per day for food, and cannot afford to live in a hotel or buy a car. They move around the world and live in old houses provided by local Jews. Some of them don&#39;t even have beds and can only make beds on the floor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With that little activity fund, not only can’t I afford a restaurant, I can’t even afford takeout. I had no choice but to give the money to the local Jewish contacts, who would buy ingredients from the mall on their behalf and cook the food themselves. It is simply impossible for a &quot;Mossad&quot; agent to drive an Aston Martin sports car as elegantly as in spy movies. The vehicles used in many operations were all old cars borrowed from local Jews. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the grass-roots teams in the early days when Koreans and Jews established their own power networks in the world, the number of Chinese people and wealth they have around the world is really much stronger. But it is a pity that Chinese expatriates with huge wealth cannot even effectively protect their personal safety and property safety. Malicious anti-Chinese and crimes against Chinese expatriates occur frequently around the world. As for the large number of violent crimes against Chinese people mentioned above, many Chinese gangsters were involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is really regrettable and heartbreaking. The reason is that there is still internal strife among overseas Chinese and there is serious internal friction in their strength. Some Chinese friends in North America vividly told me how they tried to undermine each other in business, criticized each other culturally, and even colluded with &quot;Ghost Cap&quot; (foreign police) to punish each other. The speaker was very excited, beaming, and dancing. When he was excited, his saliva sprayed into my face. This is really heartbreaking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As mentioned above, Chinese people at home and abroad have more and more interactions with the world. Contradictions, conflicts, and dangers are everywhere. How to ensure their personal and property safety, as well as their legal rights, has become increasingly difficult. The more important it is. The basis of all this is first of all the unity of the ethnic group.

Visual China/Photo&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Following Changan Automobile (000625.SZ), NIO (09866.HK, NYSE:NIO) has made another success with its battery swap. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 29, 2023, Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Geely Holding) and NIO officially signed a strategic cooperation agreement on battery swapping in Hangzhou. The two parties will work on battery swapping standards and battery swapping technology. , carry out comprehensive cooperation in various fields such as battery swap service network construction and operation, battery swap model R&amp;D and customization, battery asset management and operation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the agreement, in the future, the two parties will create two major battery swap standard systems for &quot;private cars&quot; and &quot;commercial vehicles&quot; through the &quot;co-investment, co-construction, sharing, and co-operation&quot; model to promote vehicle-end , station end, battery end, and operation end are connected and coordinated to expand the scale of the battery swap network to meet users with different needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 20, NIO founder Li Bin revealed in an internal speech to all employees that in addition to Changan Automobile, there are 4-5 potential partners currently being negotiated. In other words, more car companies may join NIO&#39;s &quot;circle of friends&quot; for battery swapping. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yanwei, the expert committee of the China Automobile Dealers Association, told Southern Weekend reporters that the expansion of the &quot;circle of friends&quot; for battery swapping has a strategic significance higher than the practical level, and it will have a limited effect on improving their respective revenue in the short term. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his view, the initial cooperation between the parties is exploratory and may start with operating vehicles such as online ride-hailing. &quot;If the results are good, it may be upgraded to more important models or high-value models.&quot; &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;There are only two roads in front of you&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Recently, a piece of news &quot;NIO lost 76.4 billion in five and a half years&quot; appeared on Weibo&#39;s hot search. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 2018 to 2022, NIO’s net profits attributable to the parent company were -23.328 billion yuan, -11.413 billion yuan, -5.611 billion yuan, -10.572 billion yuan and -14.559 billion yuan respectively. In the first half of 2023, NIO&#39;s net profit attributable to its parent company continued to suffer a loss of 10.926 billion yuan, with a cumulative loss of 76.4 billion yuan in 5.5 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although at the recent Guangzhou Automobile Industry Development Conference, NIO co-founder and president Qin Lihong emphasized that &quot;NIO will never go bankrupt, and it is impossible for it to go bankrupt.&quot; But it is undeniable that Weilai has invested too much in “peripheral products” and its sales have declined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, Li Bin’s internal speech to all employees was also on the hot search. He said that the road to battery replacement is very difficult, but it is difficult and the right thing to do. &quot;Everyone thinks of battery replacement as Amazon doing cloud services in 2003, as well as Alibaba, Tencent, Microsoft, etc. They have suffered losses for many years. Only then did we finally achieve success.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;NIO and NIO’s battery swap are always accompanied by controversy. The construction of a service system with power exchange as the core is regarded as the main reason for NIO&#39;s losses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the plan, NIO will deploy a total of 2,300 power swap stations in 2023. As of November 28, NIO has built 2,184 power stations around the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the cost of each generation of NIO&#39;s three generations of power swap stations is slightly different, if based on a rough calculation of the 3 million yuan cost of each power swap station stated by Qin Lihong at the 2023 Shanghai Auto Show, NIO&#39;s power swap performance will be The cumulative investment has exceeded 6.5 billion yuan. This does not include additional expenses such as venue rental, personnel operations and electricity expenses. Based on NIO’s goal of adding 1,000 battery swap stations in 2023, the cost of building the stations alone will be as high as 3 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shen Fei, NIO’s vice president in charge of NIO Power, revealed at a press conference in March that the battery swap station had to serve 50-60 orders per day to achieve breakeven. At that time, NIO’s battery swap station averaged 35 orders per day. -36 orders. The implication is that Weilai is still in the loss-making stage when it comes to battery replacement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yanwei believes that NIO positions itself as a luxury brand and provides services such as battery replacement and user rights to make up for the lack of product and brand power. It has indeed played a very good role in brand building in the early stage. However, as investment increased, its sales volume did not increase significantly, but instead became a huge burden. &quot;Keeping it has limited use, just throw it away. It&#39;s a pity.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are only two ways in front of Weilai, either to sell more cars and dilute the power exchange network construction from within. or introduce more car companies to participate in NIO’s power swap network to create a scale effect and alleviate financial difficulties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Weilai has already had clues about opening up the battery swap business. At the China Electric Vehicles 100 People Forum held in April 2023, Li Bin said that &quot;the battery swap service has reached the stage where it can be exported to the outside world.&quot; He hoped that other companies can share and build charging and swap infrastructure with NIO, and revealed that there are already Car companies are discussing this matter with NIO. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fu Yuwu, honorary chairman of the Society of Automotive Engineers of China, told Southern Weekend reporters that as the current battery swap model has not yet found a profit model, there are only more battery swap stations and a more convenient energy replenishment experience. Only then can more users be willing to buy battery-exchange models, thus forming a positive cycle. NIO&#39;s cooperation with Geely, Changan and other automobile manufacturers will help promote the battery swap model on a larger scale, improve the overall operating efficiency of the battery swap model, and may solve the commercialization problem of battery swap. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Or start from online car-hailing services&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The battery swap model laid out by NIO does have many advantages. For example, it only takes less than 5 minutes for car owners to replace the battery at the battery swap station. However, the disadvantage is that the battery swap model still faces problems such as high website construction costs, uncertain commercialization models, and inconsistent industry standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, there are several companies on the market that are trying to lay out the power swap model, but the construction of power swap stations is independent of each other. Since 2020, relevant national departments have continued to promote the formulation of standards for battery swap stations and battery packs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the 2023 World Power Battery Conference, Xin Guobin, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, revealed an important signal. Currently, a battery replacement technology standard system is being studied and compiled to promote battery replacement battery size, battery replacement interface, Standards such as communication protocols are unified. At the same time, relevant departments have also entered into the inspection process for the national battery replacement station standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fu Yuwu believes that each car company has different models and batteries. In the context of cooperation, battery swapping may require a transition period to improve the versatility of the battery swapping network. &quot;However, it can force companies to make better efforts in standardization, which is of key significance to the structural adjustment of the battery swap model.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, some people question that unified battery swap operation management may affect Wei Come to the battery swapping experience of existing users. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike NIO’s battery swap model, most car companies are betting on high-voltage fast charging. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 800V high-voltage fast charging platform is currently regarded as the most likely technology path. In 2019, Porsche launched the Taycan, the world&#39;s first 800V high-voltage platform model. Automobile manufacturers such as BYD, Xpeng, Great Wall, Geely Jikrypton, etc. have all begun relevant layouts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“In the long term, 800V will be an opportunity to reshape the battery industry,” Li Bin said at the 2023 Shanghai Auto Show. “But no company has yet been able to reduce the cost of 800V to close to that of the current 400V. or a slightly higher level.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yanwei also believes that high-voltage charging costs are high and is currently mainly used in relatively high-end models. It is unlikely that the technology will be transferred to low-end models in the short term. In addition, the layout of high-voltage charging piles is still imperfect, and an absolute advantage over the battery swap model has not yet been established in the short term. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that Liu Jinliang, CEO of Yiyi Internet Technology Co., Ltd., signed the power exchange cooperation with NIO on behalf of Geely Yifang this time. He has led Geely&#39;s travel business in recent years, and has been responsible for Caocao Private Car, Yao Travel and other sectors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yanwei said that online car-hailing may be the first area of ​​cooperation between the two parties. Due to cost control, operating vehicles such as taxis and online ride-hailing vehicles mostly use lithium iron phosphate batteries. The batteries are used frequently, so the demand for battery replacement will be higher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 01 Dec 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[海底捞“科目三”爆火，有创意还是“辣眼睛”？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261690]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-01 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&quot;Chatting is not as good as dancing.

In view of the differences in relevant information disclosure rules and actual disclosure situations between banks and insurance companies, Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center has constructed quantitative and qualitative indicator systems for data security in the banking and life insurance industries based on the key disclosure points of each bank and insurance company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Based on the strict data security standards of each bank and insurance institution under evaluation, and the rare data security accidents so far, this list focuses on the above-mentioned bancassurance institutions’ The strategic importance of data security, the transparency of information disclosure and the effectiveness of data security work. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Bank ranking indicator system: the most important performance in four dimensions&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Banking industry data security ranking The quantitative and qualitative indicators of the evaluation indicator system are divided into four dimensions: organizational construction, institutional processes, technical tools and effectiveness, and include five secondary indicators. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Data Security Ranking Bank Ranking Indicator System (Liang Shuyi, Liu Yuyu/Photo)&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com /cms/medias/image/23/12/01/63c5f14834.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1151&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image /23/12/01/63c5f14834.png&quot; data-key=&quot;260412&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: justify;&quot;>;Data Security Ranking Bank Ranking Index System ( Liang Shuyi, Liu Yuyu/picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;The quantitative and qualitative indicators of the banking industry data security ranking indicator system are explained as follows:&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align : justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Organizational construction&lt;/strong>; refers to the organizational structure of commercial banks in terms of data security. The research team of Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center considered the number of relevant responsible departments disclosed by commercial banks.

Standardized institutional processes are an important cornerstone and guarantee for commercial banks to build data security systems. Under this dimension, we mainly examine the number of relevant systems and normative documents on data security of commercial banks, divided into two secondary indicators: the number of its own relevant systems and the number of normative documents related to supplier management, with a total weight of 20%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Among them, supplier management refers to when a commercial bank collects, transmits, stores, filters, analyzes, exchanges, and shares all data belonging to the bank. , a management mechanism for effective risk identification, assessment and effective control of relevant external partners. At present, most commercial banks do not pay enough attention to data security when conducting annual reviews of various suppliers. For suppliers who have access to sensitive bank data, once the supplier has security vulnerabilities or misbehaves, it is likely that the information security and data security of commercial banks will be threatened. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In order to encourage commercial banks to pay more attention to the management of suppliers in terms of data security, the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center has disclosed the relevant supplier management systems disclosed by commercial banks.

This indicator directly reflects the commercial bank&#39;s ability to protect data and privacy and the effectiveness and reliability of data security protection. In view of the fact that the research and evaluation of relevant technical tools in the data industry has been very systematic, we use the number of certification systems disclosed by each commercial bank to determine the bank&#39;s technical strength in data security.

This shows that they perform better overall in multiple dimensions such as data security, internal governance and external review. In the end, China Life won the championship due to its high scores in both external judges&#39; scores and media factor scores. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;China Life proposed a comprehensive &quot;Technology China Life&quot; strategy as early as 2012, and has continued to increase investment in data security for 11 years. As one of the first batch of pilot financial institutions, China Life took the lead in the industry to migrate and put into production the Xinchuang database of key business systems, achieve 100% distributed architecture transformation of key business systems, and successfully build a new self-controlled distributed cloud architecture digital base. The company also proposed and built the first data center in the domestic life insurance industry and a high-standard underground computer room that obtained T4 certification. In addition, the company has also successfully developed a safe, green and elastic China Life Hybrid Cloud using internal private cloud and external public cloud resources, which integrates computing, storage and containers to significantly improve data security and computing capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center also found that although the life insurance institutions at the bottom have not yet experienced major information security incidents, they have shortcomings in internal governance and external review obvious. For example, 4 institutions under evaluation did not set up independent data security departments, 2 institutions did not conduct annual information security audits, and the apps of 3 institutions were accused of infringing on user privacy, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center believes that life insurance institutions at the bottom of the list urgently need to pay more attention to the construction and improvement of data security systems, and at the same time adopt more stringent and transparent policies. In the face of public concerns, the public&#39;s information disclosure standards should be strengthened through practical and effective measures to enhance public trust in the data security of life insurance institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 01 Dec 2023 20:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[李白的多重面孔：一轮夜空悬，千片秋江月]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261635]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-01 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In history, there are few Chinese poets like Li Bai. It attracted much attention during the era in which he lived. Topics, legends, and stories about him were widely circulated when he was alive, and they did not decrease with his death, but became more abundant and mysterious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A scholar did not take the imperial examination, but was recruited to the Jinluan Palace; a commoner did not have the merits of building a large scale, but was favored by the emperor; a person who intended to clarify the troubled times, He was killed by Changliu Yelang; a man who once scattered more than 300,000 yuan a year ended up with nothing in his later years; a poet fought with people in Chang&#39;an City; a Hanlin scholar who was waiting for an imperial edict, drank freely with his craftsmen; A man with lofty ideals who is &quot;willing to serve as the Prime Minister&quot; is keen on refining elixirs and collecting herbs; a madman who looks down on the powerful is excited when facing the common people&#39;s wild rice...&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Faced with this prototype that combines many contradictions, people are puzzled and determined to &quot;understand&quot; him. People not only want to understand him, but also &quot;use&quot; him, either to support themselves, to self-explain, to self-comfort, to self-liberate, or to use the past to satirize the present, or to make use of topics. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;What does Taibai look like? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;No photos or videos can answer the question of Li Bai&#39;s true face. For guessing about Li Bai&#39;s appearance, we can only rely on sporadic descriptions in historical materials and the poet&#39;s autobiography to seek clues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The senior poet He Zhizhang exclaimed that Li Bai was &quot;relegated to a fairy&quot; when he first met him. Taoist master Sima Chengzhen commented on Li Bai that &quot;the Jun family has immortal Taoist bones, which can travel with the gods to the eight extremes&quot;. There are many documents written about Li Bai&#39;s contemporaries like this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bai claimed in &quot;Books with Han Jingzhou&quot;: &quot;Although the body is less than seven feet, his ambition is ten thousand.&quot; The ancients said that tall people are like Zhuge Liang and others are all &quot;eight feet long&quot;, and the seven-foot-long man is only of average height. Even though Li Bai was majestic and magnificent, he was not tall and mighty. He should be a small man. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bai&#39;s fanboy Wei Hao described Li Bai in the preface to &quot;The Collection of Li Hanlin&quot; as having &quot;bright eyes, trembling like a hungry tiger, sometimes belted, The romance is brewing.&quot; His friend Cui Zongzhi&#39;s poem &quot;Gift to Li Twelve Bai&quot; also described Li Bai&#39;s &quot;eyes that illuminate people&quot;. It can be seen that Li Bai&#39;s eyes are indeed bright and special. Li Bai calls himself a &quot;savage&quot;, and the &quot;hungry tiger&quot; is seeing his state of breaking through the restraints, which is in sharp contrast with the &quot;or time belt&quot; below. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since the Tang Dynasty, there have been many portraits of Li Bai left. Although Li Bai&#39;s true appearance has disappeared with history, some characteristics of Li Bai&#39;s image can be directly appreciated from the painting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From the poems of Song Dynasty poets Rao Jie and Chen Shidao, we can know that the Tang Dynasty painter Zhou Fang once painted the image of Li Bai. In Zhou Fang&#39;s writings, Li Bai is a scholar wearing a black gauze hat and a white silk robe, which is highly consistent with the dress of most scholars in ancient times. Wusha was originally a skullcap commonly worn by the people, but it was not until the Ming Dynasty that it became an official hat. The white silk robe, made of white ramie, became the mainstream of fashion in the mid-Tang Dynasty, and people even became obsessed with this kind of clothing. Li Bai&#39;s own description is different from the image in the painting: &quot;The grass is wrapped in black scarves, and the purple Qi Qiu.&quot; He said that he often wore &quot;Ziqi Qiu&quot;, unlike the &quot;white robe robe in Zhou Yan &quot;. However, among many paintings that portray Li Bai&#39;s image in later generations, most painters have chosen the characteristics of &quot;Wu Sa Bai Yan&quot;. It can be said that Zhou Yan&#39;s &quot;photo&quot; to Li Bai has become the &quot;sample&quot; of Li Bai&#39;s image created by later generations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The monument corridor of the Sichuan Jiangyou Li Bai Memorial Hall, with the &quot;Kuangshan Taibai Stele&quot; and &quot;Li Bai Xiang Stele&quot; painted by the famous Northern Song Dynasty painter Li Gonglin. The former painted Li Bai, a cloth, a bamboo stick when he was studying in the mountains, and he was in full swing. After that, many young Li Bai&#39;s image originated here. The latter&#39;s prosperity Li Bai opened his face round, his ear beads were thick, his expression was realized, and he was happy and peaceful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;Tai Bai Xing Yin Map&quot; is the most representative Li Bai image painting, which is the painter Liang Kai hand in the Southern Song Dynasty. Liang Kai has the willfulness and unrestrained personality of &quot;Golden Belt Hanging Wall, Leaving the Office&quot;, and his preference for wine, which can be described as Li Bai. In the painting, Li Bai is wearing a wide clothes similar to the robe. The bun described by Jiao Mo is slightly leaning backwards, which seems to be expected to chant the poem. Almost in one go. Modern painter Zhang Daqian has painted many Li Bai, and most of them are based on the form in the form of Liang Kai&#39;s &quot;Li Baixing Yin Map&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;&quot; src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/28db5ac1.png&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot; 1080 &quot;height =&quot; 2874 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/28F6db5ac1.png &quot;data- key =&quot; 260278 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p STYLE = &quot;COLOR: #999999; Text-Align: Center;&quot;>; The &quot;Li Baixing Yin Map&quot; of the Southern Song Dynasty painter Liang Kai is now hidden in the Tokyo National Museum.

In the painting, Li Bai is supported by two insiders. Internal servants&#39; clothing is dark, her eyes are beautiful, and their gestures are hidden. Li Bai wore a bachelor&#39;s scarf, wearing a white bachelor&#39;s clothes, cinnabar boots and belts. The color tone was fast, with a nobleness; This portrait is reminiscent of Li Bai who &quot;tastes the drunk temple and leads Gaolishi to take off the boots&quot;, revealing all the free and elaboration of the emptiness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;&quot; src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/1b2cae5820.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot; 1080 &quot;height =&quot; 2376 &quot;data-src =&quot; // images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/1b2cae5820.jpg &quot;data- key =&quot; 260279 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p STYLE = &quot;COLOR: #999999; Text-Align: Center;&quot;>; The &quot;Too Drunk Map&quot; of the Qing Dynasty painter Su Liupeng is now hidden in the Shanghai Museum.

Although Li Bai looks fair, there is not much beard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Taibai Hall in the Li Bai Memorial Hall is located in a bronze statue, created by Li Xiangqun, a professor at the School of Fine Arts of Tsinghua University. The poet&#39;s slender body stands upright, with his head to the sky, the raised beard fluttering, his lips are slightly open, the most special thing is that the eyes are blurred. After the statue is exhibited, it is recognized by the cultural and art circles, and young people can accept it, but the elderly over 60 years old have expressed great puzzles for the treatment of no eyes and freehand methods, and some even protested. It can be seen that the folks in Tai Bai&#39;s hometown are not easier to emotion in Li Bai. The image of Li Bai, which is traditional, has become popular. It seems that he should be like people&#39;s imagination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;&quot; src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/8580deb4ef.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot; 1080 &quot;height =&quot; 1283 &quot;data-src =&quot; // images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/8580Deb4ef.jpg &quot;data- key =&quot; 259842 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p STYLE = &quot;COLOR: #999999; Text-Align: Center;&quot;>; Li Bai&#39;s bronze statue in Taibai Hall, author Li Xiangqun.

Going down, they are all old as literati. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Jiang Shizhen once expressed in the article that when he read his own works, he would say that this is an excellent poet. How short it is. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; So, what does Li Bai think of himself? I am afraid this biggest mystery will not have a clear answer. Only the historical horselights continued to rotate, and gradually illuminated him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>; • &lt;/span>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>; (&quot;>; ( Part of the content of this article refers to: &quot;Born My Materials: Biography of Li Bai&quot;, &quot;The basis and trajectory of the evolution of Li Bai&#39;s image&quot;, &quot;Evolution of Li Bai&#39;s image in painting works&quot;, &quot;Research on the Story of Li Bai in the Tang and Song Note Novels&quot;, &quot;Yuan Ming and Qing Li Bai&#39;s theme opera opera研究》）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 01 Dec 2023 19:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国考连续6年“扩招”，大专生可报考岗位减少106个丨时政周报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261673]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-12-01 19:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;November 26, 2023, test site in Wuhan Wenhua College, Hubei Kao District, Hubei, Many candidates are reviewed at lunch breaks.

(People&#39;s Visual Pictures) &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On November 26, 2023, the central authorities and its direct institutions in the 2024 examination were officially held in public subjects in public civil servants, and the test was officially launched in 237 cities and 87682 test rooms across the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the State Civil Service Bureau, a total of 3.33 million people passed the recruitment unit&#39;s qualification review. The number of applicants exceeded 3 million for the first time. Among them, 2.613 million candidates performed registration before the exam. 2.252 million people actually took the exam with a reference rate of about 86.2%. The &quot;National Examination&quot; plan recruited 39,600 people, and the ratio of the number of people participating in the test to the number of recruitment plans was about 57: 1. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is not difficult to find historical data, and the scale of the &quot;National Examination&quot; recruitment is rising as a whole. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In August 1993, the State Council promulgated the &quot;Interim Regulations on the National Civil Service&quot; to establish and implement the civil service system at the state administrative agencies at all levels. In June 1994, the former Ministry of Personnel issued the &quot;Interim Provisions on the Recruitment of State Civil Service&quot;, which marked the formal establishment of the national civil servant examination system and organized the first central state administrative organs civil servant recruitment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For the first time, the &quot;National Examination&quot; provided 490 places of more than 30 national organs, and the 4,400 people officially applied for the exam, equivalent to 9 people competing for 1 position. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Since then, the number of &quot;national examinations&quot; has continued to increase. From 2019 to 2024, the number of recruits was 14,500, 24,100, 25,700, 31,100, 37,100, and 39,600, respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Cheng Lianchang, the former executive deputy minister of the Ministry of Personnel and the leading group leader of the national civil servant system, has personally experienced the process of establishing and implementing the civil service examination system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He has recalled that the previous hiring system was in the form of recommendation, delivery, introduction, and transfer. In his opinion, this lack of openness, justice, and science, often causing the situation where the people they want by the state government cannot find it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 29 years after the first &quot;National Examination&quot; was held, civil servants recruited the requirements for their degree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Liu Youzhen, chief researcher at Huatu Education, noticed that there were 56 posts in the 2024 National Examination College students, which was 106 from the previous year. The number of positions and recruiters who require the master&#39;s degree to increase significantly, and the postgraduate graduate degree and above are required to have 246 posts, an increase of 814 from the previous year; there are 24 posts requesting a doctoral degree, an increase of 14 over the previous year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Grassroots positions are still recruiting big testors. The &quot;National Examination&quot; has nearly 27,000 plans to supplement directly to the county (district) level and below, and properly adjusts the qualifications, majors, working years and experience of grass -roots positions in difficult and remote areas according to the actual situation. Further enrich the grass -roots civil servants. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Another thing worth noting is that &lt;span>; 2024 The State Administration of Finance and Administration of Financial Supervision and Administration for the first time &lt;/span>;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In March 2023, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the &quot;Reform Plan for Party and State Institutions&quot;. It was decided to set up the State Administration of Financial Supervision and Administration on the basis of the Bank of China Insurance Supervision and Administration. On May 18, the State Administration of Finance and Administration was unveiled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The State Administration of Finance and Administration has a total of 1,166 positions this time. It is planned to recruit 1,660 people, and the number of recruits is ranked fifth in the system in each system. As of one hour before the end of the registration, the total number of applicants exceeded 80,000, with the largest competition ratio of 591: 1. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Earlier, the Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission recruited and other positions in the national examination at the same time, but it was actually a public institution managed by the Civil Service Law. The post was essentially a career establishment. However, after the reform, the State Administration of Finance and Administration has become a direct institution of the State Council, and the post is already administrative. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to Liu Youzhen, this year Huatu Education has opened 22 custom -made classes at top universities such as Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Renmin University of China to provide special training for students dedicated There are more than 2,000 people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is worth noting that while the number of &quot;national entrance examinations&quot; reached a record high, the number of postgraduate applicants in 2024 decreased by 360,000 after 8 years in a row. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In Liu Youzhen&#39;s view, in the severe employment situation, seeking stability is still the primary factor for most candidates to choose to take the test. &quot;To test the public, simply avoid the increasingly difficult postgraduate entrance examination, and directly join the test of the army. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; Personnel movement &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, simkai, stkaiti;&quot;>; [&lt;/span>; &lt;/strong>; &lt; span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; Hu Jinglin as the Party Secretary of the State Administration of Taxation &lt;/span>; &lt;strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body_GB2312, simkai, simkai, simkai, Stkaiti; &quot;>;] &lt;/span>; &lt;/strong>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The State Administration of Taxation, on November 28, 2023, the relevant responsible comrades of the Central Organization Department attended the meeting of the State Administration of Taxation and announced that Hu Jinglin was appointed Secretary of the Party Committee of the State Administration of Taxation eliminates the position of party secretary of the State Administration of Taxation of Wang Jun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Hu Jinglin, born in June 1964, is a doctor of economics.

&lt;p>;儿时的基辛格热衷于踢足球，一度加入了菲尔特足球俱乐部的青训。 But with Hitler coming to power in 1933, the Nazi regime&#39;s oppression of the Jewish community intensified. Because he broke into the stadium to watch games in violation of Jewish segregation regulations, Kissinger was often scolded and beaten by guards, and he was also kicked out of the team. Later, Kissinger&#39;s father was also dismissed from his teaching position without reason. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在一切变得更糟糕前，基辛格一家于1938年移民美国，此后他改名为亨利·基辛格。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/01/urcUvA76c5dNtpo6hqBOMmoB02EtHgR8Z7JDixSR.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;从政前，基辛格已是颇有名气的国际政治学者，并曾在多个有美国政府背景的机构或智库任职，三次担任纳尔逊·洛克菲勒（Nelson Rockefeller）竞选总统时的外交政策顾问，期间曾尖锐批评尼克松是“最危险的总统竞选者”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但在尼克松成为总统后，二人却戏剧性地成为了一对默契十足的搭档。 Faced with the turbulent global situation in the 1960s, Nixon gave Kissinger great room for action. &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;1973年1月，各方签署《巴黎和平协约》。南北越停火，美国撤出在越南的所有部队，北越释放所有美国战俘。 Kissinger and Lede Shou were also awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.黎德寿拒绝领奖，基辛格则宣布，他将把奖金捐给在越南战争中阵亡或失踪的美国军人的子女。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/01/aEHVSSeCESW1K1fSjsluI22dS6GuKWQLx61XkSTe.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;战后，基辛格却一度试图推迟美国对以色列进行的军火物资补偿，并致力于推动联合国安理会第242号决议实现和平。以沙特阿拉伯为首的中东产油国对美国实行石油禁运后，基辛格下场多方斡旋。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从1973到1975年，基辛格来往于埃及、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚和以色列的各路领导人之间，开展“穿梭外交”，成功取得了包括埃及总统萨达特等人的信任，以承诺出售武器换取沙特阿拉伯解除石油禁运，促成关于西奈半岛问题的两项协议——以色列将从西奈部分领土上撤走并放弃了结束战争状态的要求，埃及则同意对以色列的非军事物资开放苏伊士运河，这被认为是美国在福特政府时期取得的为数不多的外交成就之一。 &lt;/p>;
