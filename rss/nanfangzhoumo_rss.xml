Some are old ones that have been refurbished and some are new. of. A relatively recent one is: The Chinese student&#39;s thesis &quot;You must endure hardships to become a superior person&quot;. As a result, the New Zealand professor gave a zero score and asked the soul question, &quot;Why should you become a superior person while others are inferior?&quot; What do people do? Why do you divide your compatriots into three, six or nine grades? Shouldn’t everyone be equal?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you do some Internet archeology, it is not difficult to find that this is A piece of three-nothing news concocted by a certain self-media, with no specific time, university, or person. The motive of the fabricator is to use the words of foreigners who regard them as authoritative to show how low some Chinese people&#39;s words, deeds, and values ​​are, and how high their own preferred values ​​are. However, there are still many people who believe in this rumor that &quot;foreign monks like to chant sutras&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The original version of &quot;Only when you have to endure the most hardships can you become the best among people.&quot; The original version should be &quot;If you don&#39;t suffer the most hardships, you can become the best among people.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chapter 32 of &quot;Journey to the West&quot;. Tang Monk said: &quot;Disciples, be careful. If you encounter a high mountain ahead, you may be blocked by tigers and wolves.&quot; Sun Wukong said: &quot;Master, as a monk, don&#39;t talk at home. Do you remember the &quot;Heart Sutra&quot; written by Monk Wuchao, which says, &#39;If you have no worries, you will be free from worries.&#39; No fear, stay away from words that confuse dreams? But it is just to sweep away the dirt on the heart and wash the dirt on the ears. If you don&#39;t suffer in the suffering, it is difficult to be a good person. You should not worry, but there is an old man, even if the sky falls, you can Be safe. What are you afraid of?&quot; This was an education for the master. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also from &quot;Warning Words to the World&quot;, &quot;It&#39;s Hard to Meet Your Husband after Spring Falls in the Yutang&quot;. I saw a couplet hanging on the door: &quot;After ten years of suffering in front of the window, he became famous all over the world.&quot; &quot;This is the couplet written by my father-in-law. He passed the national examination and became a minister: Later, our father was When I study here, I will become a minister. I am studying here now, and I also want to climb the dragon and the phoenix to carry forward the ambitions of my predecessors.&quot; I also saw a couplet on the second door: &quot;If you don&#39;t suffer the hardships, it is difficult to become a master.&quot; The young master hurriedly returned. Study room...with my mind turned around and my determination to study diligently. This is a lot of self-motivation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The difference between the two versions is: &quot;Only when you endure hardships can you become the best among people.&quot; The first sentence is a necessary condition for the latter sentence; &quot;If you don&#39;t suffer the most hardships, you can become the best among people&quot; is the probability. Expression. The latter seems more rigorous and allows exceptions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What do you think of this kind of saying? If you regard &quot;You must endure hardships to become a master&quot; as a full judgment, then it is not difficult to find counterexamples. In a logical sense, this proposition has been refuted. However, after that, everyone thought this was wrong and discarded it? Obviously not, everyone will just think you are making excuses, because this is not the correct way to open the proverb. The use of proverbs is inherently situational: only when specific preconditions are added or placed in a specific context can the proverb be established and can be used. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are a large number of sayings in various languages ​​with completely opposite meanings. Here is an example of Chinese: &quot;A powerful man cannot bend&quot; vs &quot;A man can bend and stretch&quot;; &quot;I will not offend others unless they attack me&quot; vs &quot;Strike first to gain strength, but to attack later will suffer&quot;; &quot;It is better to be broken into pieces than to be left intact&quot; vs &quot;to stay intact&quot; With the green mountains there, you are not afraid of running out of firewood&quot;; &quot;Take a step back and the sky will be brighter&quot; vs &quot;The brave will win when you meet on a narrow road&quot;; &quot;Tolerate a moment of calm&quot; vs &quot;It is tolerable, but what is intolerable&quot;; &quot;Everything is inferior, only reading is good&quot; vs &quot; Three hundred and sixty lines, he will be the number one scholar&quot;; &quot;The blue is better than the blue&quot; vs &quot;The hair on the lips is weak, and the work is not solid&quot;; &quot;Three cobblers are better than Zhuge Liang&quot; vs &quot;Three monks have no water to drink&quot; ...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tell me, which sentence before and after is right, which sentence is wrong, or are they both wrong? In fact, as long as they are put into the appropriate context, these common sayings with opposite meanings can be used correctly. This is the correct way to use common sayings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Specifically, &quot;Only when you have to endure hardships can you become the best&quot; or &quot;If you don&#39;t suffer the most hardships, can you become the best among others&quot;, there are also common sayings that have the opposite meaning or different emphasis, such as &quot;One life.&quot; &quot;Second Movement and Three Feng Shui&quot;, &quot;Choice is more important than effort&quot;, &quot;Don&#39;t use tactical diligence to cover up strategic laziness&quot; and so on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In my opinion, success is determined by many innate and acquired factors. 1. Fate: when you were born in which country and family, this constitutes your initial conditions and boundary conditions; 2. Wisdom: intellectual endowment, the computing power and algorithm of the brain, which are also innate; 3. God: you Your knowledge system and values, as well as your vitality, motivation, courage and patience, have both innate and acquired components, but the acquired component is greater, because you can always choose your values ​​and choose to be a courageous person; 4. Luck: Factors you have no way of knowing or controlling because you are in a complex random system. In a specific process, &quot;god, wisdom, fate, luck&quot;, which factors are more important cannot be generalized. A person&#39;s success always resonates with the trend of history and personal destiny. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, among the many factors that determine success, hardship, diligence or patience are certainly important, especially for people without background. Other statements such as &quot;The sharp edge of a sword comes from sharpening, and the plum blossoms bloom from the bitter cold&quot;, &quot;There are roads in the mountains of books, and diligence is the path, and there is no limit to the sea of ​​learning, and the boat is made by hard work.&quot; Do they sound more pleasing to the ear? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What many people don’t like is “people superior to others”. This needs to be looked at twice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, from the perspective of rights or rules, of course everyone should be equal. No one is above anyone else, and no one is subordinate to anyone. It is against anyone&#39;s privileges or slavery. , which is the basic principle of civilized society. In this sense, there should be no &quot;people superior to others&quot; and &quot;people inferior to others&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, there are always certain professions that are more respected in society and have higher social evaluation or reputation. For example, professionals such as surgeons enjoy a higher social status and are not considered &quot;human beings&quot;. What about &quot;Master&quot;? Also, some people are respected and admired by everyone because of their ability, knowledge or virtue, and they even have many followers. For example, people like Xinxiang Xian are the core of society. If neighbors come to him to resolve disputes, does he count? What about &quot;people superior to people&quot;? In a company or organization, whether it has a strict hierarchy or a relatively &quot;flat&quot; management, there is a chain of command and a superior-subordinate relationship. The subordinates must obey the instructions of the superiors to do things. Can senior executives and superiors be considered &quot;superiors&quot;? &quot;Woolen cloth? In a nutshell, from the perspective of power or influence, elites or those with higher social status are often called &quot;dragons and phoenixes&quot;, and there is nothing wrong with being considered &quot;superior&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, if you want to be &quot;superior&quot; and pursue the privilege of overpowering others or trampling others under your feet, it is naturally a despicable value; What&#39;s the problem if you deepen your field, improve your talents and virtues, become popular, and gain a higher social status? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 02 Nov 2023 08:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[书城伏案的侧影：写在刘世南先生百年诞辰之际]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259765]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/01/gJOH0MA1fEMOll8Ren0VMWx1Krulso5uG3AasqhT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;916&quot; height=&quot;687&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/gJOH0MA1fEMOll8Ren0VMWx1Krulso5uG3Aasq hT. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256565&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Mr. Liu Shinan took a photo in front of the Chongshao Library of Jiangxi Normal University. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of Li Taosheng)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;People who long for friends who fear friends&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Liu Shinan Mr. (1923-2021) was a fighter. This is the first impression of him by people who are familiar with him and those who are not familiar with him. He dared to criticize various scholars, including those older than him, those of his generation, and those younger than him. His articles were scattered in various books and periodicals from the late 1970s to the new century, making readers People who feel the enthusiasm and persistence of his criticism are of course embarrassed by the critics, but they do learn from him, and many criticized scholars express their gratitude to him and respect him even more. His criticisms were actually aimed at problems, especially the style of study. His straightforward writing style contained a profound call for sincerity, simplicity, seriousness, and a down-to-earth style of study. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not many people know that he is very eager to be criticized. He criticized Mr. Liu Mengfu (&quot;Outside the Academic Hall&quot; page 301), and Mr. Mengfu also criticized him. He invited Mr. Mengfu to write a preface to his &quot;Daluo Ju Shi Cun&quot;. Mr. Mengfu wrote a long preface in which he included his own critical opinions. He criticized it with real swords and guns. Mr. Shinan did not think that Sorry, let it remain in the preface as it is. This is the style of sincerity and magnanimity. He said in a letter to me on July 26, 2005:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Mr. Liu Mengfu is middle-aged and a poet. Learn the art of poetry and achieve the best of both worlds. He looks down upon him as a servant, looks down upon his followers, and is sincerely afraid of his friends. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He respects and looks forward to his &quot;fearful friends&quot;. When he heard Mr. Tao Wenpeng mention that some parts of his &quot;History of Qing Poetry Schools&quot; were a bit &quot;old&quot;, he wrote a letter asking Mr. Tao to point out his shortcomings in detail. Mr. Tao replied, and Mr. Shinan made a copy of the letter. Send me a copy and write:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Send me a copy of Mr. Tao Wenpeng’s letter, to be compared with Mr. Tao Wenpeng’s book review Although Mr. Yun and Mr. Tao made many mistakes in their compliments, Mr. Tao was able to correct their flaws. I hope Mr. Yun can do the same. In the past, Chen Si once said: &quot;The writings of the world cannot be without disease. I always have good people to ridicule my writings, and if there are bad ones, I should revise them in due course.&quot; He also quoted Ding Jingli and said: &quot;Who in future generations will know that my writings are evil?&quot; I hope that Mr. Zou Zhen, as the editor-in-chief of &quot;History of Qing Poetry Schools&quot;, will be able to rectify the shortcomings of my book and inform future generations of those who govern Qing poetry about what to avoid. This is the meaning of an academic public instrument. (January 12, 2005)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that he is still not satisfied with Mr. Tao&#39;s criticism and hopes to get more and more real criticism. He regards criticism as an &quot;academic official tool&quot;. &quot;To look at it. This allows us to understand more clearly that the reason why he carried out academic criticism with all his might was because he really had no selfish motives and was only dedicated to the healthy and mature development of the academic world. His attitude towards criticism is not only aimed at others, but also aimed at himself, which is conducive to his own improvement and is conducive to clear understanding in the academic community. He sets an example and has a bright mind, which is admirable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/A2lmlAB2WbWNF9rofeqfKqiPLtvwopiAQGhCByuu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height= &quot;866&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/A2lmlAB2WbWNF9rofeqfKqiPLtvwopiAQGhCByuu.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256567&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Professor Liu Shinan and his &quot;Detailed Notes on Three Hundred Qing Poems&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He was very moved by others&#39; corrections to him and expressed his gratitude repeatedly. Our publisher was planning to launch chronological anthologies one after another. Considering that Mr. Shinan was familiar with Qing literature, editor and editor Zhou Xuanlong, then director of the Classics Department, sincerely invited him to annotate &quot;Selected Works of the Qing Dynasty&quot;. Considering that time was tight, he asked his Student Professor Liu Songlai assisted. After the manuscript arrived, Ms. Wen Lichen, a graduate student at Beijing Normal University, intern, reviewed it for the first time under my guidance. Then I reviewed it again. After writing two revisions, I sent it to Mr. Shinan for review. He said in a letter written in the Provincial Library on October 1, 2005:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;September 22 and Review comments and copies of book reviews have been received. Please read them. After reading it, I feel ashamed and excited! &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the articles of Kuangzheng and Supplement, we can also see that Mr. Wen Lichen and Wen Lichen have made profound achievements in the study of female history, and their admiration for them cannot be overstated! I secretly say that the &quot;Selected Works of the Qing Dynasty&quot; will be of some benefit to this world in the future. It shows that the cooperation between the four of us is not caused by Song Lai and me. I plan to add a few words to the preface of this book to clarify the meaning and to show that we do not dare to take advantage of beauty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He later insisted on adding words of praise to me and Xiaowen in the preface of the book, which shows that he was happy after hearing about it and had an open-minded and sage mind, which was like a spring breeze. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/9ICJwEasJaiGQCkwpKLheTnuNb0kMpOpfGgmCBxe.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height= &quot;774&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/9ICJwEasJaiGQCkwpKLheTnuNb0kMpOpfGgmCBxe.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256566&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Professor Liu Shinan’s two works. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;A silverfish in the book of life and death&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Mr. Shinan&#39;s fighting spirit is mainly reflected in his diligent reading and writing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He does not have many books, mainly because the collections of two generations of his were destroyed during the special period, which made him extremely sad, and he generally stopped buying books (&quot;Odd Records of Masters and Friends&quot;, page 117). He mainly visits the library. He is a frequent visitor to the provincial library and school library. In 1994, after fourteen years of arduous reading, research, and writing, he finally completed &quot;History of the Qing Poetry School&quot;. When proofreading the manuscript the following summer, he reviewed the process with joy:&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Reminiscent of the past, when every year passes, the bookstore is still busy with calligraphy. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wan Jiaqing Tuanluan, sitting alone and smiling. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The box is full of cards, and there are more than delicious meals. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After fourteen years of hard work, the book is finished with a pen and inkstone. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Appendix to &quot;History of Qing Poetry Schools&quot; &quot;Proofreading in the Midsummer of Jiaxu&quot; &quot;History of Qing Poetry Schools&quot; Manuscript...&quot;)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Note: &quot;Every Spring Festival and New Year&#39;s Eve, I sit in the library, facing the administrator from a distance.&quot; Our publisher is preparing to publish the simplified version, and I am honored to be responsible. The editor, during the editing process, greeted him and mentioned this impressive scene. He wrote me a reply in the sample library on the evening of December 30, 2003 and the next day:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Thank you for your attention.

One New Year&#39;s Eve, the curator and he &quot;faced each other from a distance&quot;, which was quite a scene. He wrote to his student Professor Guo Dan: &quot;It is now nearly 4 o&#39;clock in the afternoon on New Year&#39;s Eve. Director Zhang and I are the only two people left in the library reading hall; Director Zhang is on duty in person and will accompany me until 4 o&#39;clock with a smile. The bell closes the door.&quot; (Guo Dan&#39;s &quot;The Realm of Scholarship and the Style of Personality - A Note on Mr. Liu Shinan&quot;, &quot;Occasions of Teachers and Friends&quot;, page 237) Such a curator is really a good curator, and such a reader is really a good reader. This is called It is a good story in the contemporary reading world. The postcard he sent me on December 31, 2006 said: &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The bookstore is sitting at the desk, cocooning and feeling pity, forgetting Time passes in a hurry. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;If Hua Yan was not drunk this night, who would have known that the day after tomorrow would be the New Year. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Still reading on New Year’s Eve, it is indeed the style of reading seeds. Of course, he didn&#39;t just focus on New Year&#39;s Eve. In fact, every day was precious to him. Letter from June 4, 2004:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Selected Works of the Qing Dynasty&quot; is very busy, I have never been so nervous , because the school will be closed during the summer vacation, so I have to finish this before the vacation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the scene when I was rushing to select and annotate &quot;Selected Works of the Qing Dynasty&quot; with Professor Song Lai. Later, when there was no urgent work, I still went to the library unremittingly. In the past, revolutionaries had a heroic saying: &quot;Sit through the prison.&quot; Mr. Shinan, in his old age, still insisted on going there regardless of his illness. He really had the spirit to penetrate the library. The letter dated January 10, 2013 said:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;One ​​year has passed and I was recently hospitalized for removal of nasal warts. Medical advice It was basal cell carcinoma and had been completely removed. I am already ninety years old and have lived and died for a long time, so after I was discharged from the hospital, I still sat in the library. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Professor Guo Dan called Mr. Shinan to wish him a happy New Year on the morning of the first day of the Spring Festival in Year Yiwei in 2015, the answer he heard was &quot;I am already reading in the provincial library&quot;! (Postscript to the reprint of &quot;Occasions of Teachers and Friends&quot;) Mr. Li Taosheng has been accompanying Mr. Shinan for many years. He said in the article &quot;Unforgettable words from the bottom of my heart&quot;: &quot;Books are all his spiritual sustenance.&quot; &quot;No matter the wind, frost, rain or snow, he always He would always show up at the library on time like a staff member. He said he hoped he could die at his desk in the future.&quot; (&quot;Occasions of Teachers and Friends&quot;, page 249) This shows how obsessed he is with books. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;From thousands of books&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Mr. Shinan has read extensively and is particularly familiar with classics and history, so he can read many treatises We are sensitive to misunderstandings, misjudgments, and corrections and can provide corrections. In addition to helping others publish absurdities, he mainly devoted his energy to the research and writing of &quot;History of Qing Poetry Schools&quot;. In addition, a lot of study was done on the annotations of &quot;Selected Works of the Qing Dynasty&quot;. After taking on this task, he devoted himself wholeheartedly to the selection of articles. Although Professor Song Lai was invited to participate in the annotation work, he still did everything personally:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From text selection to punctuation to the comments, I will read them all and revise them. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;At these times, I was busy selecting articles, mainly from &quot;Sikuquanshu&quot; and &quot;Continued&quot; Choose from &quot;Xiu Siku Quanshu&quot; and &quot;Cunmu Series&quot;, and a few have to be found separately from the thread-bound library. For example, Jiang Shiquan has no text in &quot;Continued Cultivation&quot;, but &quot;Pictures of Night Classes with Sound Machines&quot; must be selected. Others can be deduced by analogy. The selection of the text is time-consuming. After selecting it, it must be photocopied and then hand-copied into simplified Chinese characters. (December 16, 2003) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to concentrate on the work of &quot;Selected Works of the Qing Dynasty&quot;, he served as the chief academic consultant for the compilation of &quot;Yu Zhang Series&quot; in Jiangxi Province universities for several years. (that is, final check) also resigned. This shows his determination to devote himself wholeheartedly to the work of &quot;Selected Works of the Qing Dynasty&quot;. Because he was familiar with the collected works of the Qing Dynasty, and he read them day and night, by December 30, 2003, he had &quot;read page by page the Qing Dynasty Collection of Continuing the Complete Collection of Siku Quanshu&quot;, and had reached 154 of the 188 volumes. , there are still 30 volumes left, I can finish them before the winter vacation,&quot; and said, &quot;Then I will read &quot;Sikuquanshu&quot;, there are not many collections. I haven&#39;t read &quot;Cunmu&quot;, so I don&#39;t know how many.&quot; In selecting articles, &quot;Be sure not to show off your hands and eyes, and don&#39;t be attracted by people&#39;s enthusiasm&quot; (letter dated December 30, 2003). In this letter, he still could not hide his critical eye and expressed his opinions on several books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I was reading the collected works of Zeng Guofan today, and I found four books that were annotated by modern people. Take &quot;Yuancai&quot; as an example , Tu Xiaoma&#39;s version, Lai Xinxia&#39;s version, and Guo Yuheng&#39;s version all concluded: &quot;Is it possible to say that it is not false?&quot; &quot;Is it possible to say that it is not false?&quot; On the contrary, Zheng Zhenduo&#39;s &quot;Late Qing Dynasty&quot; &quot;Selected Works&quot; concluded: &quot;Is it true to say that the accusation is not false?&quot; That&#39;s right. Tu, Lai and Guo...I don&#39;t know that the &quot;ye&quot; in &quot;Ke Hu Ye&quot; is actually &quot;ye&quot;. Books such as &quot;Jing Zhuan Shi Ci&quot; make it very clear, and the ancient prose written by Han Yu and Ouyang Xiu is swaying and often colorful. There is this aria. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the &quot;king&quot; in &quot;Everyone is king and is ordered to do so&quot; has been misunderstood. &quot;Mistakenly changed to &quot;must&quot;, it is also analyzed. He did not deny your contribution, he just wanted to explain that he would learn from their achievements, but would never simply plagiarize:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;Even if we refer to this kind of annotated version, we must analyze every detail, never make vague and influential remarks, but strive to be clear and accurate. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are actually very few similar works that we can rely on. Even if we refer to them, they must be adopted with discernment. This is in line with what Mr. Shinan has always advocated: &quot;Speak from the heart, never tamper with a single word.&quot; academic spirit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By June 26, 2004, it was the final stage of &quot;Selected Works of the Qing Dynasty&quot;. He wrote to me to introduce the writing situation of the preface of the book:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot; font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The preface can prove that the two of us have a slightly new understanding of Qingwen and do not follow what others say, precisely because we have put a lot of effort into the annotation of the works. For example, &quot;the genre is single but the styles are diverse&quot;, we not only pointed out &quot;how it is&quot; but also explained &quot;why it is so&quot;. This is the characteristic of our learning. It is also aimed at traditional Chinese literary criticism. The traditional method is improvisational and perceptive, and only points out &quot;how it is&quot; without analyzing &quot;why it is so&quot;. We have accepted the influence of Western academics and always like to pursue a &quot;why&quot;. Therefore, with regard to the emergence of the Tongcheng School (including the later Yanghu School and the Xiangxiang School) and the praise of &quot;all the articles in the world can only be found in Tongcheng&quot;, we try to find out its logical inevitability through this phenomenon. There are always laws to follow in phenomena, among which the law of cause and effect is most worth pondering, and the results of pondering are also the most thought-provoking. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Tao Wenpeng heard about this preface and immediately asked Mr. Shinan to publish it in &quot;Literary Heritage&quot; in advance. Mr. Shinan said in his letter on January 12, 2005:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Tao Jun asked to rewrite the preface of &quot;Selected Works of the Qing Dynasty&quot; For the thesis, I have cooperated with Song Laijun. However, Huamei may not be fashionable and Zhu Yi may not nod. But I can be confident that the words and sentences of these two people come from their hearts and come from thousands of books. There is no suppression or similarity. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The confidence reflected here comes from his steady reading and long-term cultivation. This spirit is reflected in his works and critical articles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The method of popularizing culture through book selection is traditional, but it is an effective method of cultural communication for thousands of years. However, few people are willing to take on such work now because it requires Investing a lot of energy requires a high level of appreciation, extensive knowledge reserves and profound cultural heritage. The art of annotation is extremely difficult to learn, and it can easily lead to mistakes. However, Mr. Shinan resolutely agreed to do the work of &quot;Selected Works of the Qing Dynasty&quot;, which shows his confidence and responsibility. After the publication of this book, readers responded very well. Mr. Shinan was very happy and wrote a letter saying:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What will your company do next year? If there is a new topic that is suitable for me to work with, I hope it will be successful. Although Gai Pu is already old, his spirit has not faded, but he is itching again and again, and he is unhappy and unprepared to do anything. (Written in Provincial Map on October 1, 2005)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that he has the ambition of &quot;being an old man, but aiming for a thousand miles&quot;. Considering that he is old and cannot be overworked, we did not invite him to do another one. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Young Thinker&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Mr. Shinan seems to be a bookworm while sitting in the library, but he is actually a &quot;young thinker&quot; ( Chen Ji&#39;s &quot;Mr. Forever Young&quot;, &quot;Occasionally Diary of Teachers and Friends&quot;). In addition to &quot;History of Qing Poetry Schools&quot; and &quot;Daluoju Poetry and Essays&quot;, Mr. Shinan also has &quot;Outside the Academic Hall&quot; revised and reprinted, and &quot;Occasional Notes of Teachers and Friends&quot;. These two books are not &quot;pure&quot; books. , the collection is relatively mixed, the form is very random, but the theme is clear, they are all academic texts, and they are all &quot;dry information&quot;. It preserves a large number of academic correspondence, collects some book reviews, talks about academic methods, and more importantly, the academic spirit. It is interesting. We also collected some opinions that differed from those of Mr. Shinan. He said in the preface of &quot;Occasions of Teachers and Friends&quot;: &quot;&#39;The dispute is between gentlemen&#39;, and it is by no means a dispute of will. For me, it is &#39;I love my teacher, and I especially love the truth.&#39;&quot; He once again praised Mr. Mengfu, Praise him as a &quot;critical friend&quot; and &quot;admire his courage to stick to the truth.&quot; Regarding this book with the theme of &quot;I and the Intellectuals I Understand&quot;, Mr. Shinan said: &quot;The nature of this book is similar to &quot;The Inheritance of Sinology Teachers in the Kingdom of China&quot;. It is academic and can be used as a modern and contemporary book. Materials on academic history and intellectual history.&quot; Indeed, its content is more than an independent paper. It contains rich materials for contemporary scholars&#39; ideological exchanges and even confrontations. It has great academic value and is undoubtedly a breakthrough in form. and pioneering. The letter dated July 18, 2004 stated:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You will feel that this is a picture of the times, which reflects the The vigorous fighting of the soul. It can leave a valuable legacy to future generations and let them know how intellectuals in our era are searching. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;External Edition&quot; of this book includes an article &quot;How do contemporary intellectuals inherit and carry forward the fine traditions of ancient Chinese scholars?&quot; &quot;&quot; embodies his exploration on the ideological and spiritual level, letting people know that he is not a nerd, and his active mind and body surpass many young people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In academic research, he has direct and in-depth discussions. In terms of poetry creation, it also has profound meaning and is worth appreciating. On January 12, 2005, he wrote a letter to talk about his &quot;Da Luo Ju Shi Cun&quot;:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Mr. , you will know that the humble poems are not works criticizing the wind and the moon, but are all words of crying and sighing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said in the preface to &quot;Shi Cun&quot;: &quot;Any poem must be written for a purpose. It will never lament the old age and humbleness, but only the worries of the people, the country and the world.&quot; Many of his poems directly record reality, which makes people sigh and impress him with his broad mind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I felt that it took Mr. Yu fourteen years to write &quot;History of Qing Poetry Schools&quot;. After the book was edited and published, I wrote a book review and published it in &quot;Hainan Daily&quot;, which was later revised and published. In Guangming Daily. I sent it to Mr. Wang for review. He said in the letter dated June 4, 2004:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;is busy working on &quot;Selected Works of the Qing Dynasty&quot; , I usually put the letter aside and reply later. I didn’t expect to receive your letter today, let alone read your book review. After reading the book review carefully, I burst into tears. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You may be wondering: Why am I so easily excited? There are about seven or eight book reviews about &quot;History of Qing Poetry Schools&quot;, but I have never been so excited. As for you, as the editor-in-chief, you obviously read &quot;History of Qing Poetry School&quot; carefully, so you also carefully read &quot;Outside the Academic Palace&quot;. In addition, you have superb appreciation, rich life experience, and correct ideological understanding. , can I write such a book review that makes me excited. The masterpiece is not long, but it all hits the point, especially the point of humanistic care, which only you dare to point out. Frankly speaking, when I wrote &quot;History of Qing Poetry Schools&quot;, I really had the mentality of Confucius writing &quot;Spring and Autumn&quot; and Ma Qian writing &quot;Historical Records&quot;. This point was only pointed out in a book review by Professor Wang Qizhen of our school, but the article seems not to have been published yet. But you coincide with Mr. Wang, which is the most gratifying thing for me. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Mr. Yunbo, please let me say a word of sincere gratitude: &quot;Uncle Bao, you know how to take care of me. I am proud that Yu Qing will not be a guest.&quot; This is a couplet made up at random, all using &quot;Historical Records&quot;, and I feel it is very relevant. Some people may question: How can people deal with things? Then I have to say it without any shame: Just consider yourself dead. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My husband affirmed the book review I wrote. I have this confidence, but I never expected that it would make him &quot;cry with emotion&quot; and write &quot;Uncle Bao knows how to manage&quot; and so on. words of thanks; he directly confided his ambitions and pursuits, which shows that he didn&#39;t take anything for granted. In 2011, he recorded a super-star academic video, talking about &quot;Me and the History of the Qing Poetry School&quot; (later included in &quot;Occasional Notes of Teachers and Friends&quot;), and mentioned that &quot;Mr. Ge Yunbo is really my close friend.&quot; All of this moved me very much, and made me feel the power of the seniors to inspire the younger generations. It also made me feel the glory of being a down-to-earth editor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above experiences have undoubtedly increased our closeness. When our family went to Nanchang for the first time to visit Mr. Shinan on October 6, 2018, the host and guest were delighted. He held my hand forcefully and held on for a long time. It was not like the hand of a 96-year-old man at all. He can support himself. He also often goes to the library. We all believe that he can easily survive his old age. We look forward to visiting him again. But unexpectedly, I received a text message from Professor Song Lai on August 2, 2021, and learned that Mr. Shinan passed away the night before. I originally wanted to write a sentimental article after learning from the pain, but I was burdened with publishing projects and was unable to do so. This year marks the 100th anniversary of Mr. Shinan&#39;s birth. I made up my mind to write a brief statement of my admiration and gratitude for him, so I came up with the above immature commemorative text. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 23:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[娄底7岁女孩遭性霸凌疑云：到底是夸大其词还是轻描淡写？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259761]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a netizen in Loudi, Hunan claimed that his 7-year-old daughter was raped by more than a dozen female classmates in her class during lunch break at school. Bullying and even injuries to the private parts have attracted great attention on the Internet. The local report stated that an investigation confirmed that a female student was involved in a brief brawl, but no intentional harm was found. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 28, a parent from Loudi, Hunan Province posted on social media, saying that his 7-year-old daughter was studying in the second grade of a primary school in a township in Loudi, Hunan Province. During lunch break on October 20, she was raped by 16 or 17 girls in her class. The classmates bullied her on the playground. These female classmates not only beat her daughter, but also sexually bullied her, causing injuries to her lower body and causing unbearable pain. Both the school and the parents of the bullying students have a negative attitude toward solving the problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Little girls in the second grade collectively bullied their female classmates, especially sexual bullying, which was appalling. People can&#39;t help but think of the sexual bullying incident of a 9-year-old primary school student in a bilingual school in Datong, Shanxi that came to light a few months ago. Therefore, the incident quickly became a hot spot on the Internet and attracted great attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 30, Lengshuijiang City (a county-level city under the jurisdiction of Loudi City), where the incident occurred, issued a situation statement in the name of a joint investigation team, saying that after discovering the relevant video, it immediately established a joint investigation team led by the Municipal Education Bureau , the Public Security Bureau and other departments. After preliminary investigation by the public security department, it was found that the girl involved Zhang and six other female classmates were classmates in the second grade of a primary school in the city; at noon on October 20, because of an incident while skipping rope on the playground There was a dispute and &quot;mutual fighting&quot; occurred for about 1 minute, during which Zhang was &quot;briefly surrounded and slapped&quot; by several other classmates; after monitoring and monitoring was obtained, the girl involved was questioned &quot;protectively&quot;, and the witnessing teachers and students were investigated, but no evidence was found. Intentional injury. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The characterization of the incident in this official report is completely different from the accusation made by the victim’s mother. The description of the incident process is also vague and unclear, and there is no clarification on the key issues of the accusation. If the official has sufficient evidence that the girl&#39;s parents are exaggerating, they should publicly refute the evidence. Otherwise, not only will it fail to eliminate public doubts, but it will arouse greater doubts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first question is whether the girl Zhang’s lower body was injured. According to information released by Zhang&#39;s mother, Zhang had multiple soft tissue injuries on his body and his lower body was also injured. He was in unbearable pain when urinating and was forced to hold in his urine. However, although the official report confirmed that &quot;mutual fighting&quot; occurred, it did not mention whether Zhang was injured. This is also the aspect that attracts the most attention from netizens and makes people the most angry. Officials should not shy away from this, they should investigate this and make the results public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If Zhang’s lower body is indeed injured, then this is a very serious violation of minors. The cause of the injury must be found out. If it involves criminal behavior, he must be severely punished. If Zhang was not injured, then enough credible evidence must be produced to refute the accusations made by the girl’s parents. For example, Zhang can be taken to a tertiary hospital outside Loudi City for examination accompanied by his parents, and the examination results can be announced. If Zhang’s mother exaggerates or lies, she should not avoid it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, it is necessary to release the relevant video of the incident that occurred on the playground to set the record straight. Zhang’s mother said that Zhang was beaten by 16 or 17 girls in his class on the playground. The official statement stated that except for Zhang, only six students were involved in the incident, and that several girls were &quot;fighting with each other&quot; for only about a minute, while Zhang was only &quot;briefly surrounded&quot; and &quot;swatted&quot; by several classmates. According to the two sides, not only the number of participants is hugely different, but there is also a huge difference in nature between &quot;beating&quot; and &quot;fighting with each other.&quot; Since the official statement mentioned that the police obtained the school&#39;s surveillance video, it means that the incident was recorded, and it was not the &quot;aging surveillance&quot; mentioned by the school in Zhang&#39;s mother&#39;s post. Since there is a video, it should be made public in its entirety so that the public can judge for themselves whether it was a &quot;beating&quot; or a &quot;fighting&quot;, how long it lasted, and whether there was any &quot;intentional harm.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, for the sake of protecting minors, minors who can be identified in the video can be treated with protective techniques, such as mosaic, blurred faces, etc., but it should be ensured that several minors can be seen. The individual&#39;s involvement in the incident, and the extent of the &quot;ruffling&quot; involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It seems a bit incredible that a 7-year-old girl would bully her classmates and also be sexually involved. But it&#39;s not impossible. In a bullying incident at a bilingual school in Datong, Shanxi, the bully was only 9 years old. This was not the first time that bullying had occurred, it had also started in the second grade. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a stereotype that bullies in school are boys. In fact, this is not the case. Among school violence incidents, the proportion of women committing violence is not low. In March 2023, a bullying incident broke out in Hainan in which a 13-year-old girl was beaten and humiliated by a group of same-sex peers. When the Datong incident attracted great attention, criminal law teacher Cai also received news that a female classmate was bullied by other female classmates in the dormitory, and also engaged in sexual behavior, and the perpetrator even took a video. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early years, CCTV reported on a study and found that more than 80% of the perpetrators of school bullying videos posted on the Internet were women. Of course, this may be related to the fact that female bullies are more likely to take videos and upload them online to humiliate their victims, but it also shows that female perpetrators of school violence are by no means uncommon. Moreover, among the campus bullying committed by women, many of them are a group of people bullying one person, and the targets of their bullying are mostly women. Also, among the bullying committed by women, a high proportion involves sexual humiliation, such as being forced to strip naked and take photos. This may be because it creates a stronger sense of shame for the victim. These characteristics of female bullying are consistent with the accusations made by the mother of the victim in the Loudi incident that more than a dozen girls beat and sexually bullied her daughter. This is one of the reasons why netizens are more willing to believe victims’ accusations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This matter has attracted great attention on the Internet, and the official understatement of the situation is obviously difficult to convince the public. This reminds people of the sexual bullying incident at a bilingual school in Datong, Shanxi. The school and the authorities tried to turn the incident into a minor matter, but in the end, the bullying incident was confirmed. The same is true for this suspected bullying incident in Loudi. If the authorities have sufficient evidence to support their account of the situation, they should make it public promptly to refute the accusations made by the girl&#39;s parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[舒徐礼乐自圆融：礼学宗师沈文倬先生小记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259627]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 20:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/30/E4iGWSPPxsQh8e00gO9ijH5s3ebTpOzxQVWlMy0o.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;864&quot; height=&quot;610&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/E4iGWSPPxsQh8e00gO9ijH5s3ebTp OzxQVWlMy0o. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256139&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Shen Wenzhuo (1917-2009), a contemporary master of rituals and a famous Confucian scholar, dedicated his life to Studying the study of the three rites, he has made outstanding achievements in many fields such as etiquette, history of Confucian classics, philology, inscriptions on oracle bones, bibliography, and compilation of ancient books. In particular, the study of the &quot;three rites&quot; has solved many problems in the history of etiquette and Confucian classics. Many unresolved problems were highly praised by Gu Jiegang. The picture was taken in May 1986. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Shen Wenzhuo (1917-2009) was an &quot;invisible man&quot; at Hangzhou University. In October 1978, I entered the Chinese Department as an undergraduate student. He once gave us a few lectures on &quot;Common Knowledge of Ancient Culture&quot; in the &quot;Ancient Chinese&quot; class, but no one had much impression of him. When I was in graduate school, he was a member of the mentor group, and I started to get to know him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The headquarters of Hangzhou University (today’s Xixi Campus of Zhejiang University) in the early 1980s was small in area. Tall plane trees stretched out towards the boulevard, forming domes, showing the history of this campus. years. In the southeast corner are several rows of four-story buildings made of blue-grey bricks. The teachers&#39; dormitory and the graduate student dormitory face each other. Between the two floors is the boiler room, where the fire roars in the morning and we go there every day to turn on the water. In autumn and winter, the sycamore leaves have faded to gray, and the walkways of the boiler room are covered with finely crushed coal ash. Against the blue-grey brick walls, the vision is gray. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, Mr. Shen lived in a room on the first floor of the first unit of Building No. 1, about fifteen or six square meters, opposite the public toilet. It was humid in spring, sultry in summer, and cold in winter. . There was no kitchen, so he could only light a fire in the corridor, so for more than 20 years, he had been eating in the canteen, occasionally cooking hoof bones and the like to improve his life. It wasn&#39;t until 1986 that he was assigned a two-bedroom house and moved out of here (in July of that year, he was approved as a doctoral supervisor by the State Council&#39;s Discipline Review Group). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have never entered his residence, but every time I pass by, I will stop for a moment. Later, I visited his door many times in my dreams. Through the glass above the door, I seemed to see the banners on the wall, but I couldn&#39;t always see clearly what was inside. It was like his personality and education were very mysterious and hard to see clearly. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I often meet him on the way to the cafeteria. He was over sixty years old at that time, with a broad forehead, sparse hair, and a gray beard, but his face was very rosy. He is not tall, but very strong. In winter, he put on an old gray smock over his old cotton-padded jacket, and carried a shallow bamboo basket in his left hand, which also looked like a dustpan. His big hands had thick knuckles. He always had a smile on his face and seemed to be moving as he walked on the road, making a slight &quot;huffing&quot; sound in his mouth. If he encounters the gaze of others, he responds with a smile in his eyes, his mouth seems to be moving, but he does not speak. He looked gentle and calm, yet as deep as the ocean. He beams with energy when he smiles, inspiring passers-by. So I think he was in a good mood at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What we &quot;new&quot; graduate students often talked about at that time was our own supervisors and each other&#39;s supervisors: which field we mainly worked in, what books we published, where we published papers, and what we heard about them. What are the requirements for students, what are the mantras, what new things were said in class...proudly introduce the findings of the instructor, share with each other, and listen carefully to other people&#39;s additions and discussions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Roommate Chen Shenyong is the first graduate student led by Mr. Shen Wenzhuo. My understanding of Mr. Shen gradually enriched through classmate Sheng Yong’s admiring explanations and everyone’s discussions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/kTlWhOwgCv9rDWA37zbDLtgi7iIhLLAXRfIVGRBC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;999&quot; height= &quot;750&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/kTlWhOwgCv9rDWA37zbDLtgi7iIhLLAXRfIVGRBC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256136&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;From left: Fang Jianxin, Mr. Shen, Li Jiemin, Wang Yunlu (photographed in 1997). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Shen Wenzhuo, whose courtesy name is Fengsheng and nickname is Yinan, is from Wujiang, Jiangsu. He entered a private school when he was young, and studied by himself when he was older, without obtaining any diploma. In his early years, he studied ancient Chinese poetry from Shen Chang, and studied literature and history from Jin Tianhe and Yao Tingjie. In the early 1940s, he specialized in the study of &quot;Three Rites&quot; from Cao Yuanbi and became his close disciple, teaching and mentoring him for nine years. Cao Yuanbi (1867-1954), known as the last outstanding Confucian scholar of the Qing Dynasty, was already in his seventies, so he placed high hopes on Shen Wenzhuo: &quot;If you observe well, you can expect success.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1946, he published He wrote articles such as &quot;Shuo Gao Le&quot; and &quot;Wax&quot; and &quot;Wax&quot;, which attracted Gu Jiegang&#39;s attention, and he was hired as the deputy editor and reviewer of the National Translation and Translation Center. He was mainly responsible for proofreading classics, compiling summaries, and drafting classics dictionaries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1950, he was sent to study at the Political College of North China People&#39;s Revolutionary University in Beijing. In June of the following year, he was assigned to Shanghai Library as deputy director of the Cataloging Department. The &quot;Zhongshu Zonglu&quot; we often consult, which is three very thick volumes and is more than a foot high when stacked, was compiled under his leadership. In 1960, the editorial team of &quot;Zonglu&quot; was rated as an advanced collective in Shanghai. As the team leader, he attended the Shanghai Heroes Meeting as a representative. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 1963, at the invitation of Professor Jiang Liangfu, he was transferred to the Language and Literature Research Office of the Zhejiang Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (located at Hangzhou University, with Xia Chengtao as the director) as a full-time researcher and went to Hangzhou alone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March, as soon as I arrived in Hangzhou, I went to pay a visit to Mr. Ma Yifu; in late April, I went again. &quot;From now on, we will learn to pay homage to our predecessors and scholars, and when we meet each other, we should treat relatives with respect and be harmonious.&quot; I had some enlightenment and thought, and wrote &quot;Jiangzhuang Wen Xue Ji&quot; to record it. After autumn, he went to the Northeastern Institute of Literature and History in Changchun to teach &quot;Etiquette&quot; and returned to Hangzhou in the winter. I wanted to visit again, but I couldn&#39;t. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following year, &quot;the trend of talking about ancient studies came to an abrupt end, and the interest was greatly reduced.&quot; Soon, I went to the countryside to participate in the &quot;Social Education Movement&quot; and stayed in a commune in my hometown of Zhuji County. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, he had published many papers in &quot;Archaeology&quot; (1961, 1963). It is said that Mr. Guo Moruo, then president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, spoke highly of him after seeing him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; occurred, the research office was disbanded, and he transferred to the Chinese Department of Hangzhou University and worked as a document clerk in the department&#39;s reference room. Because of his extensive knowledge and strong memorization, his colleagues were shocked to call him a &quot;walking dictionary&quot;. He lived alone in silence, but never stopped studying etiquette. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1974, he was arranged to go to Anji to participate in the &quot;Agricultural and Forestry Class&quot; of the last &quot;May 7th&quot; Cadre School of Hangzhou University. He worked as a &quot;Duck Commander&quot; during the day and explored the secrets of etiquette at night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 1975, four types of works, including the &quot;Review of the Han Bamboo Bamboo Bamboo Slips Unearthed in Wuwei&quot;, were sent to Mr. Gu Jiegang for review. Gu Fuxin said that &quot;Taituan is actually the first person in the contemporary world to organize the Book of Rites&quot;, but at the same time he lamented that he didn&#39;t know when these results would be available. The above words were only circulated within a small circle at that time and were not known to the outside world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/jHofSRDsIAXS1YQGGmUlO06aJt08qBm9Z1fpUvxx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;854&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/jHofSRDsIAXS1YQGGmUlO06aJt08qBm9Z1fpUvxx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256137&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Gu Jiegang replied to Shen Wenzhuo&#39;s letter. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the end of the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, the situation had changed again. In 1979, he transferred to teaching position. The following year, he was rated as an associate researcher at the age of 64. Our 1982 graduate student is his first enrollment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, Hangzhou University highly regarded the &quot;Literature and History&quot; of Zhonghua Book Company and the &quot;Chinese Literature and History Series&quot; of Shanghai Ancient Books as the top journals in the field of ancient literature and history, and Mr. Shen was a frequent reader. Among them, &quot;A Brief Discussion on the Practice of Rituals and the Writing of Books on Rituals&quot; (Wenshi, Series 15 and 16, 1983) states that &quot;the practice of rituals existed earlier than written records&quot;, thus clarifying the relationship between rituals and ritual books. Mr. Yang Xiangkui later called this article &quot;a monumental work with unprecedented achievements.&quot; Another example is the article &quot;The Enrollment of the Twelve Doctors of Huanglong and the Establishment of the Taixue Prefecture and State School&quot; (1983), which analyzes the complex historical facts of the establishment of the Doctor of Confucianism in the Han Dynasty, corrects the mistakes in Pi Xirui&#39;s &quot;History of Confucian Studies&quot;, and corrects Wang Guowei&#39;s &quot;Han and Wei&quot; &quot;Doctoral Examination&quot;, thus making a detailed analysis of the rise, fall, increase and lack of doctorates in the three dynasties of Wu, Zhao and Xuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Referred to as a later scholar, Mr. Shen&#39;s articles have a very broad vision. They have both macroscopic concerns, covering ancient and modern times, and microscopic research, and are as meticulous as hair. At the same time, various methods are used to contain materials, and the amount of information is huge. He has unique insights into almost any issue in traditional etiquette, and almost every sentence in his article embodies the result of his thinking. His narrative language is very elegant and can be almost seamlessly connected with the cited documents, which is a state that is difficult to achieve. I also deeply agree with this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, I did not seriously read Mr. Shen’s works and papers at that time, and I was afraid to read them because they were too profound. I have only read his column in &quot;Chinese Literature and History&quot;, titled &quot;The Secret of Rituals&quot;. Sometimes several articles are published in one issue, and the length is only one or two pages, and the explanation is one word or one thing. , are all explanations of difficult issues, and are of great relevance to the study of literature and history. The elegant and concise writing impressed me endlessly. He has been writing this kind of short essays since 1946, and he has accumulated a lot of copper from the mountains. Many years later, he compiled it into a book, still named as a column. It was only a thin volume with more than 100,000 words, but it was well received. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/48zsNz45py5GAydBqZLHrzAwV4pvbvSzSSnFdV4w.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;801&quot; height= &quot;564&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/48zsNz45py5GAydBqZLHrzAwV4pvbvSzSSnFdV4w.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256138&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Mr. Shen Wenzhuo is in the study. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I started learning to write papers, I knew that short papers were the most difficult to write because they were hundreds of words long. , more than a thousand words, how difficult it is to ask a real question, list the materials and explain it clearly! It is said that Mr. Shen&#39;s other book, &quot;An Interpretation of Different Texts on Chinese Bamboo Slips of &quot;Li&quot;&quot;, had more than 400,000 words when it was written. He was not in a hurry to publish it and repeatedly compressed it. When it was finally published, it only had 160,000 words. When we were graduate students (1982.9-1985.6), except for some papers, he had no published works. His first monograph, &quot;An Examination of Zongzhou Rites and Music Civilization,&quot; is actually a collection of his essays. It was only published in 1999. The writing spanned more than 40 years, and the total number was only 14 articles. He was already an octogenarian by then. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Shen has always been indifferent to fame and fortune. He said: &quot;It is not easy to manage the classics and rituals. Only when the mind is clear of &#39;devil obstacles&#39; and the mind is as clear as water, can one focus on learning and become more general.&quot; In fact, he did not write much in his life, but scholars praised him as &quot;the master of rituals.&quot; , because his articles do not rely on accumulation of quantity, but win on quality. Each of his articles solves an unsolved problem in history. Cumulatively, it is breathtaking and even more admirable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We are very fortunate that Mr. Shen opened a class specifically for us. At that time, we were five graduate students, guided by five tutors. Each of them taught three classes, which constituted a semester&#39;s graduate course. Even Teacher Guo Zaiyi attended his three classes and sat in the back row. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Shen has suffered from a severe stutter since he was a child. It is very difficult for him to even speak a complete sentence. This is why he rarely attends classes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The content the teachers taught at that time was self-selected and derived from years of deep thinking. In my impression, Mr. Shen Wenzhuo talked about issues related to various schools of thought in the pre-Qin period and ancient and modern texts. In my limited knowledge at that time, &quot;Lun&quot;, &quot;Mencius&quot;, &quot;Lao&quot; and &quot;Zhuang&quot; were independent writings, and I had a little dabbling in them. I had never read &quot;Mozi&quot;, and I dared not touch &quot;Li&quot; and &quot;Shu&quot;. As for each There is no understanding of the relationship between families. Mr. Shen&#39;s class revealed the intricate relationships between various schools of thought, especially the Jixia School and the famous schools. These schools, which had few works handed down to the world, used to dominate the competition with other schools, making other schools Each school had to respond and adjust; some schools that disappeared had their doctrines integrated by other schools and passed down to later generations. This made me suddenly understand that each argument was not a complete and systematic explanation of a certain theory, but an expression of its own views on the opponent. If you don&#39;t know the background of this debate, you will feel that its argument is extremely biased, like It&#39;s fighting against the air, I don&#39;t know why. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is very much like when I play center on the basketball court. Every time I hit hard, I have to push the person behind me away so that I can turn over and score the ball. You have to know how powerful the &quot;top&quot; is to understand how much effort it takes for me to &quot;rely on&quot;. If the person behind me is blurred, and people only see me turning backwards and forward into the air, they will definitely laugh at me for using too much brute force, which is the so-called &quot;biased approach&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In our classroom, Mr. Shen burst out each word from his mouth vigorously. Some words took him two or three times to complete, so he wiped the sweat with a handkerchief. Still mouthing. When he talks about happy things, he will also chuckle. He first used his own research and explanation to redefine the old concepts, and then extended them to put forward new definitions for a series of issues. As a result, the related characters, events, schools and theories were swept away from the long-accumulated dust and revealed. A completely different appearance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We all listened attentively, lest we miss a syllable. Because the words that burst out one by one were like formation symbols flying in the air, forming a wonderful formation from which the truth of history emerged. The formation was so turbulent, with forces coming and going, waves vying with each other, sounds and principles echoing each other. This was the era of a hundred schools of thought contending! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than forty years have passed, and Mr. Shen’s specific explanation left only a few impressions on me. For example, “Book of Rites” is later than “Lidian”; &quot;Jinwen&quot; refers to Han Li, who explains the inheritance of various texts in the Han Dynasty from the perspective of the characters used in writing the texts; someone&#39;s interpretation is established as an academic official, which is &quot;learning from the law&quot; before it is established. , it is &quot;Family Law&quot;... Most of the other specific knowledge has been forgotten now. Only his &quot;chichi&quot; voice occasionally still rings in my ears, so the feeling caused by his explanation came again. It flowed through my brain like a tide, making me feel an inexplicable shock. More importantly, through these explanations, I understand that I must look through the surface of documents to feel the &quot;forces&quot; and their interactions behind the times, in order to vaguely see the &quot;invisible hand&quot; of God. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After meeting Mr. Ma Yifu, Mr. Shen wrote a poem:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Confucian Classics and Interpretation Canon 1 Furnace melting, &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Prove that the mind is the same and the same. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Goodness, beauty, depth and subtle appearance can be understood in different ways,&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Shu Xu&#39;s rituals and music are harmonious. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also recorded: &quot;Mr. (Ma) knew about Yu&#39;s etiquette for treating Ji Dan, and he expressed the purpose of the etiquette, kindness and beauty, and was amazed by it. I also introduced the meaning of &#39;Shu Xu&#39;, No matter how hard you look at Mr. Shen, don’t dismiss him with different opinions.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now I recall Mr. Shen’s three classes, record every bit of what I saw and heard at that time, and respectfully take his last sentence as title to express my memory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[解聘247名自聘科级干部：萍乡经开区“瘦身”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259704]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/01/aRbzoDBFvweqUXSNpmmpnQkAxjFfXOcZzgoPAzbx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height=&quot;846&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/aRbzoDBFvweqUXSNpmmpnQkAxjFfXOcZzgoPA zbx. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256318&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Pingxiang Economic and Technological Development Zone was established in 1992 and upgraded to a national-level economic and technological development in 2010 district. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Zhai Xingli/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This is a major choice in my life.&quot; In April 2023, Zhang Shichun chose Give up his status within the system and stay to work in a large state-owned enterprise in Pingxiang Economic and Technological Development Zone, Jiangxi Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, he had worked in this state-owned enterprise for 4 years, but retained the establishment of a public institution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2023, Pingxiang Economic Development Zone announced the cancellation of 19 self-established institutions and the dismissal of 247 self-employed section-level cadres based on the personnel system reform plan adopted by the Pingxiang Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A considerable part of the dismissed personnel were originally on-staff personnel. After their self-employed positions in the Economic and Technological Development Zone are dismissed, they can choose to retain the establishment and have the Economic and Technological Development Zone coordinate the arrangement of new jobs, or they can Give up the establishment and work in an enterprise. The dismissed persons who were originally non-staff personnel can participate in the full-scale competition for recruitment, or they can choose to resign. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Shichun is a department-level cadre self-employed by Pingxiang Economic Development Zone. Facing the reform, he has two choices. Abandon the establishment.&quot; After a family meeting, he decided to stay in the business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reasons why Zhang Shichun became a self-employed cadre are not complicated. As one of the earliest economic development zones established in China, after 31 years of development, the population of Pingxiang Economic Development Zone has increased from the initial 10,000 to about 250,000 now, and its functions have also expanded from solely economic development to taking into account social management and public affairs. Services, etc., have set up their own management agencies, established their own positions, and hired their own personnel during the development process. This has both objective reasons and subjective reasons such as previous organizational establishment management was not standardized and personnel were highly arbitrary. This is also a common phenomenon in domestic development zones. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2023, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the &quot;Plan for the Reform of Party and State Institutions&quot;, clarifying that both the central and local governments must streamline their staffing. On this basis, many places have begun to clear out non-staff personnel. Harbin City in Heilongjiang Province, Shiyan City in Hubei Province, Chuxiong Prefecture in Yunnan Province, Huizhou City in Guangdong Province, Zhuzhou City in Hunan Province and other places have introduced plans to clear out non-staff personnel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pingxiang Economic Development Zone has comprehensively standardized personnel management. Among the 247 dismissed cadres, 63 people who were illegally borrowed were dismissed, 17 people were dismissed, and another 8 people gave up their business establishment to work in enterprises. After the reform, all employees will implement &quot;host management&quot; (a personnel management method in which staff and non-staff staff are hired as hosts at all levels), rather than simply &quot;throwing out&quot; non-staff staff. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The fired deputy minister&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Zhang Shichun, who was born in 1970, worked as a teacher for 10 years after joining the workforce. His original identity was in the professional establishment. After leaving school, Zhang Shichun worked in the Education Bureau. In 1997, he was transferred to Pingxiang Economic Development Zone and later became deputy director of the Party and Mass Work Department of the Economic and Technological Development Zone Party Working Committee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, due to work needs, Zhang Shichun was adjusted to a large state-owned enterprise in the Economic Development Zone as deputy secretary of the party committee and secretary of the Discipline Inspection Commission, and the establishment was still retained in the Party and Mass Work Department of the Economic Development Zone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There were quite a lot of situations like Shichun at that time.” Yu Zhifeng, deputy director of the Party and Mass Work Department, explained that from the economic development zone agencies to working in enterprises, there are still such personnel established by the agencies. , seven or eight in total. State-owned enterprises do not have public institutions, but they still retain the status of public institutions and are self-employed department-level cadres in the Economic Development Zone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Self-employment means self-employment. Without filing with the superior organizational department, the superior organizational department will not recognize it. If a civil servant or public servant is appointed as a deputy section-level cadre through normal organizational procedures, the superior organizational department needs to register for it, but the Economic Development Zone hires him to a full-section level without filing with the superior organizational department based on work needs. In fact, His rank is still deputy section level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2020 and 2022, the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee inspection team pointed out this problem during its two inspections of Pingxiang. Take 2022 as an example. In April of that year, the Fourth Inspection Team of the Provincial Party Committee inspected Pingxiang. On July 28, the Fourth Inspection Team reported the inspection situation to the Party Working Committee of Pingxiang Economic Development Zone. The third of the four main opinions was on the economic development. In the organizational work of the open area, “there is a big gap in improving the organizational system that is connected from top to bottom and has strong execution.” The inspection team put forward suggestions and suggestions for rectification, &quot;focusing on solving key issues in the personnel field of the institution.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yu Zhifeng introduced that the more prominent problems in the personnel field of the Economic Development Zone are that there are too many self-established institutions and too many self-employed cadres: after years of development, the number of self-employed section-level cadres in the Economic Development Zone has reached 247. There are three main categories: on-staff personnel in the Economic Development Zone, cadres transferred from higher-level agencies or brother districts and counties, and self-employed non-staff personnel in the Economic and Technological Development Zone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the personnel reform work was launched, the Economic Development Zone organized relevant leading cadres to conduct one-on-one interviews with the 247 self-employed cadres, led by the main leaders of the Economic Development Zone Party Working Committee. Yu Zhifeng said that the one-on-one conversations lasted for several months, mainly to explain the urgency of policies and reforms, and to &quot;patiently and meticulously do the ideological work of the dismissal target.&quot; For self-employed cadres who are already on staff, we should give them the right to choose whether to give up their staff and choose to work in enterprises or retain their staff and work in government agencies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Shichun prefers to give up his official position and stay in the company, but he also made it clear to his family the risks of working in the company: once the company encounters difficulties in its development, his income will also drop, and may even Unemployment, &quot;After discussion, we finally decided that I would stay in the company. I also believe that the company will develop better after the reform of the Economic Development Zone.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Yu Zhifeng, who carried out the dismissal work, was also a self-employed cadre. Before his dismissal, he served as party branch secretary and deputy director of the Party and Mass Work Department. After his dismissal, he remained the business editor, but only retained the position of deputy director of the Party and Mass Affairs Department. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Little horse and big cart&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;While dismissing 247 self-employed cadres, Pingxiang Economic Development Zone also dissolved and merged 19 self-established institutions , including the District Political and Legal Committee, District State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, District Letters and Calls Bureau, etc. Yu Zhifeng explained, “In the course of the development of the Economic Development Zone for many years, with the continuous increase in social affairs and service population, the Economic Development Zone set up its own institutions and hired a large number of cadres in violation of regulations without obtaining the consent of superiors.”&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;Pingxiang Economic and Technological Development Zone was established in 1992. It was upgraded to a provincial development zone in 1995 and a national economic and technological development zone in 2010. After the area adjustment and expansion at the end of December 2021, the total area under its jurisdiction is 119 square kilometers. The permanent population is about 250,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of June 2021, there are 230 national-level economic and technological development zones. The GDP of Pingxiang Economic and Technological Development Zone has been ranked among the top 100 economic and technological development zones in the country for five consecutive years, ranking 62nd in the country in 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like other economic development zones across the country, Pingxiang Economic Development Zone is also a dispatched agency of the municipal government and is a functional area rather than an administrative district. &quot;At the beginning of its establishment, the functions of the economic and technological development zone were single, mainly economic development tasks, so the higher-level departments approved a small establishment for the economic and technological development zone.&quot; Zhu Min, director of the Party and Mass Department of the Party Working Committee of Pingxiang Economic and Technological Development Zone, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Materials provided by the Economic and Technological Development Zone to Southern Weekend reporters show that the specific regional scope was not delineated at the beginning of the economic and technological development zone. After it was upgraded to a provincial development zone in 1995, the Pingxiang Municipal Government decided to divide the six The administrative village is designated as a direct development area with a development area of ​​10 square kilometers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“With such an area and population, the Economic Development Zone did not need much establishment at that time.” Zhu Min said, but in the process of development, the area of ​​Pingxiang Economic Development Zone gradually expanded, and with the agglomeration of industries , Pingxiang City’s old urban area population relief and other factors have led to a sharp increase in the population of the Economic Development Zone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to official data released by Pingxiang City, the permanent population of the Economic Development Zone has increased from 110,000 in 2011 to 250,000 in 2021. In the same year, the permanent population of Luxi County under the jurisdiction of Pingxiang City was 260,000, and the permanent population of Lianhua County was 210,000. This means that the population managed by the Economic Development Zone is equivalent to that of an ordinary county town in Pingxiang City. In terms of economic scale, the 2022 New Year&#39;s message of the Pingxiang Economic Development Zone shows that the economic development zone completed a regional GDP of 22.3159 billion yuan in the first three quarters of 2021, ranking first in Pingxiang City. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How many establishments does the Pingxiang Economic Development Zone have, which manages a population of 250,000? Zhu Min introduced that in 2022, the superior establishment department re-examined the establishment of the Economic Development Zone Management Committee. There are currently 102 public employees and 138 business employees, for a total of 240 employees. Southern Weekend reporters learned from authoritative channels that a certain district in a surrounding city has more than 700 civil servants and more than 1,000 public servants. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to cope with the increasing social management functions as the population and regional area continue to increase, Pingxiang Economic Development Zone began to set up its own institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned that there are basically two situations when economic and technological development zones set up their own institutions: population growth creates social management needs, and they must set up their own institutions to provide public services; municipal functional departments have vertical management needs , requiring the Economic and Technological Development Zone to set up corresponding institutions for work docking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, the Economic and Technological Development Zone has set up five social work bureaus, each of which manages several administrative villages. In fact, it performs the functions of the township government or city sub-district office; the Urban Management Bureau of the Economic and Technological Development Zone, The establishment of the Garden Management Bureau was because the Pingxiang City Urban Management Bureau and the Garden Management Bureau required the Economic Development Zone to also set up a management agency to facilitate the unified planning and implementation of urban management and gardening work in Pingxiang city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also some self-established institutions set up by the Economic Development Zone to coordinate line work. The Public Security Bureau of the Economic Development Zone is the Development Zone branch established by the Pingxiang Municipal Public Security Bureau. The prosecutorial functions are performed by the Procuratorate in the Development Zone established by the Pingxiang Municipal Procuratorate. The judicial institution is hosted by the Anyuan District Court and the Development Zone Tribunal is established. In order to coordinate the work of public prosecutors, prosecutors and law enforcement as well as petitions, inspections and comprehensive management, the Economic Development Zone has set up its own political and legal committee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After 31 years of development and construction, the Economic Development Zone has become a functional area with a high degree of industry-city integration. The functions of the Economic Development Zone Management Committee have shifted from single to comprehensive, and in fact are performing functions similar to those of district and county governments. . During an interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend, a major leader of the Economic Development Zone analyzed that with the current establishment and number of personnel, the Economic and Technological Development Zone&#39;s ability to perform all management functions is a bit like a &quot;small horse and a big cart&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“Lock the entrance and keep the exit smooth”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Although there are too many self-established institutions and self-employed cadres, it is necessary for actual work, but it is also a matter of organizational personnel management. Caused by insufficient standards, too many agencies and cadres have also produced many adverse consequences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“In terms of cadre team building, the superior organizational departments do not recognize the self-employed cadres of the Economic Development Zone, which has a negative impact on the growth of cadres. This is objectively not conducive to the training of cadres.” Yu Zhifeng explained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhu Min served in the Organization Department of the Pingxiang Municipal Party Committee before being transferred to the Economic Development Zone as the director of the Party and Mass Work Department. In 2019, Zhu Min went to work in the first cadre section of the Organization Department of the Pingxiang Municipal Party Committee and was responsible for contacting the Economic Development Zone. “At that time, I raised the issue of irregular organizational work in the Economic Development Zone and too many self-established institutions.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, the Pingxiang Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government vigorously promoted the reform of the personnel system of the Pingxiang Economic Development Zone. The Municipal Party Committee Organization Department, the Municipal Party Committee Editorial Office, the Municipal Development and Reform Commission and other departments took the lead in organizing outings to learn from the experience of personnel reforms in economic development zones in other regions. . By 2022, the advancement of personnel reform will be significantly intensified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 11th issue of &quot;China Institutional Reform and Management&quot; magazine in 2021 published a signed article &quot;Pingxiang promotes standardized management of non-staff personnel&quot; written and edited by the Pingxiang Municipal Party Committee. The article summarizes Pingxiang City’s work experience in cleaning up non-staff personnel. The overall principle is to integrate non-staff personnel and on-staff personnel into total management. The institutional establishment department shall approve the number of non-staff personnel based on the department’s functions and staffing situation. We must resolutely clean up the non-staff personnel employed in the post, and standardize the management of the non-staff personnel employed within the post. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The article also summarizes the direction of the use of non-staff personnel. It is prohibited to use non-staff personnel for administrative examination and approval, administrative law enforcement, archives management, political personnel, letters and visits, and confidentiality-related positions; insisting on &quot;doing things without hiring people&quot; In principle, employers are not allowed to use non-staff personnel for property management, security, greening maintenance, canteen services, information network services, public building facilities and equipment maintenance, etc., except for primary and secondary schools and kindergarten canteens, and all use market service outsourcing, The government purchases services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the cleanup of non-staff employees in the Economic Development Zone is also carried out within the framework of the above principles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the personnel system reform in April 2023, the Economic and Technological Development Zone implemented overall control of posts based on the personnel system reform plan approved by the Pingxiang Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government. On this basis, the Economic Development Zone further stipulated that in accordance with the requirements of the general staff control, no new non-staff personnel will be added in the future, and only personnel within the establishment quota will be recruited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Lock the entrance of non-staff personnel into the Economic Development Zone, strengthen the assessment and management of existing personnel, implement the last elimination system, and smooth the exit.” Zhu Min said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;It is by no means “sweeping out”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When dismissing self-employed cadres, the Economic Development Zone’s main concern is causing excessive reactions from the dismissal targets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhu Min reported on the reform plan to the main leaders of the Pingxiang Municipal Party Committee, &quot;The leader emphasized the general direction: the purpose of the reform is not to destroy your Economic Development Zone, the Economic Development Zone is still the engine of Pingxiang&#39;s economic development .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After dismantling and merging 19 self-established agencies, the work was reorganized and the functions of the dismantled agencies were merged into 8 offices including the Party and Government Office of the Economic Development Zone, the Economic Development Bureau, and the Social Development Bureau. It has internal institutions and 8 public institutions including the park enterprise service center and social governance center. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the Economic Development Zone breaks down the identity boundaries and implements a unified &quot;sponsoring system management&quot; for both staff and non-staff personnel. It does not distinguish whether they are on staff or not, only based on the position. The sponsorship is divided into 12 levels. Each level is divided into 12 levels. Levels correspond to different salaries. The host has a promotion and downgrade mechanism, and has set an annual assessment failure rate of 5%. It is clear that those who fail the assessment for two consecutive years will be eliminated directly, so that the host level can be moved up or down, and the salary and performance can be improved or reduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Zhu Min’s view, the economic development zone’s gradual digestion of non-staff personnel is by no means simply “sweeping them out”, but using a sponsorship system to allow the remaining staff and non-staff personnel to compete on the same track, “Whether it is Whether within the system or outside the system, opportunities must be given to these young people.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the Southern Weekend reporter’s interview, the Economic Development Zone was conducting a survey. The theme was to explore a new mechanism for motivating cadres, and to build a competitive system through competition, job transfer, waiting for job, demotion, dismissal, etc. selection mechanism. Southern Weekend reporters asked several organizers of the Economic Development Zone for confirmation. They said that after the organizational reform, the work pace is faster, the work intensity is higher, and the work pressure is greater. After the National Day holiday in 2023, many organizers have been working continuously and can basically only take half a day off on weekends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another reason is that after the organization was dissolved and personnel were eliminated, the social management functions of the original organization were not completely divested, and various functions were divided into newly established public institutions. Therefore, the overall work The amount has not decreased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, with the arrival of the next round of reforms, economic and technological development zones across the country may usher in a functional &quot;downsizing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;High-Quality Development Plan for Development Zones in Anhui Province&#39;s &quot;14th Five-Year Plan&quot;&quot; released in March 2022 has a special chapter discussing the reform of the development zone system and mechanism, focusing on the rational division of development zone management agencies , territorial governments, and development and operation companies have real power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2023, the &quot;Regulations on Promoting High-Quality Development of Development Zones in Henan Province (Draft)&quot; was submitted to the Standing Committee of the Henan Provincial People&#39;s Congress for its first review. The draft clarified that the Management Committee is mainly responsible for policy formulation, development planning, Administrative management functions such as administrative approval, investment promotion, and corporate services do not mention social management functions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The statements in both places send a signal: the functional positioning of development zones at the provincial level may still be economic development. So, how to deal with the social management functions that are gradually increasing in the development process of development zones in various places? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned that in the national overall plan for the next round of institutional reform of development zones across the country, straightening out the relationship between development zones and administrative regions and gradually stripping away social affairs management functions is one of the trends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国际足联：沙特是2034年足球世界杯唯一申办方]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259759]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 19:55:17&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;FIFA announced on October 31 that the Saudi Arabian Football Association was the only one to submit a proposal to host the 2034 Football World Cup before the deadline.

This is also where the headquarters of Gome Electric Appliances is located. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since its opening in 2000, this 36-story light blue building with an apron on the top floor has witnessed the founder of Gome Huang Guangyu become the richest man in China three times, and now it has witnessed the rise of Gome The embarrassing situation of electrical appliances due to losses, payment arrears, and wage arrears. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In mid-October, on the lottery page of the Gome APP, a pop-up window targeting Gome founder Huang Guangyu and current Gome Chairman Huang Xiuhong appeared, including &quot;arrears of wages and arrears of payment.&quot; In fact, issues such as wage arrears at Gome have already emerged as early as 2022, and angry employees clashed with Huang Guangyu in Pengrun Building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;To what extent have employees been forced to do pop-up windows? Now Gome is in a state of no one&#39;s supervision, and employees can only find windows by themselves.&quot; Leaving Gome in Beijing in March 2023 Zhao Qiang, an employee at the headquarters, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Headquarters&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Empty&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to Gome Retail (0493.HK) Financial report data shows that Gome Group has a total of approximately 32,000 employees in 2021. As of the first half of 2023, the number of Gome Group employees is 3,609. This means that in one and a half years, Gome has lost 90% of its employees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Pengrun Building used to be full of American people. There was no place to park in the morning, and the cafeteria was full of people at mealtime.&quot; Zhao Qiang told Southern Weekend reporters, but when he left , most floors of the building were deserted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of Monday, October 30, Southern Weekend reporters came to Pengrun Building. It is divided into two buildings, A and B. The 3rd to 36th floors of Building B are the offices of Gome Electric Co., Ltd., and the only building in Building AB is The difference is that only Building B has strict access control. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I walked into the Gome headquarters, the corridor lights were still on. The biggest feeling was that it was &quot;empty&quot;. Conference rooms, office areas, and reception rooms of all sizes were locked, and there were only a few staff members. Walking around with the cleaning staff, I saw strangers visiting me, but no one came up to ask. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the 18th floor of Pengrun Building, banners hanging on both sides of the elevator read &quot;Become a trusted world-class retail enterprise&quot; and &quot;Lead the survival and development of enterprises with &#39;faith&#39;&quot;. The black background wall in the middle is printed with &quot;Gome&quot; is two big words. On the right side of the background wall is the publicity room of Gome Group, which is densely packed with various certificates and trophies from Huang Guangyu, Du Juan and Gome Group in the past. But the time is mostly concentrated before 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Conflicting with these past honors, there are now A4 papers posted everywhere here saying &quot;No entry for non-staff members of this floor&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The 18th floor is the place where Gome receives merchants and suppliers. There are several large VIP conference rooms, and there used to be many people every day.” Zhao Qiang said. Southern Weekend reporters observed this floor for nearly half an hour, but no one came except one or two cleaning staff. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Gome supply chain companies responsible for providing support to merchants and suppliers are concentrated on the 16th floor. They used to include Gome Customization Company, Ningbo Gome Zhenxuan Technology Co., Ltd., etc. The original office areas of these companies have been locked. And was removed from the floor guide board. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2021, Huang Guangyu was officially released from prison after serving his sentence. He made a high-profile statement that he would strive to restore the company to its original market position in the next 18 months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;His biggest move after his return was the launch of the &quot;True Happiness&quot; APP, which represents Gome&#39;s retail strategy. The financial report shows that in 2021, Gome spent 962 million yuan on advertising on this APP. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Traces of &quot;True Happiness&quot; appear intensively on the 17th floor of Gome&#39;s headquarters. The red banner of &quot;Let&#39;s fight for a better career together and create a better life together&quot; is still hung in the office area, and the words &quot;12.24 9 :00-12:00 The room for the scheduled meeting of &quot;Home Appliances Division, Life Electrical Appliances&quot; has been locked. Zhao Qiang lamented, &quot;&#39;True happiness&#39; is earned by how many Gome employees work hard, work overtime and stay up late.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fifth floor of the headquarters includes the national third-party logistics company established by Gome Group in 2012.&quot; The office area of ​​&quot;Anxun Logistics&quot;, a logistics company that had previously been rumored to be planning an IPO. It&#39;s pitch dark here now. At the end of 2022, news has emerged that Anxun Logistics and its subsidiaries owed more than 3 million in freight to multiple carriers in Henan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It can be said that after 2023, the entire United States will fall into a state of deathly silence.” Zhao Qiang told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/bt8FPUdo6Mqi7q4arE3fifbQywWAnz0zpzEUxeUm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/bt8FPUdo6Mqi7q4arE3fifbQywWAnz0zpzEUxeUm.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256383&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The traces of &quot;really happy&quot; are still there. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Mei Ling/photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Where did the money go&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; The top 36 floors of Pengrun Building were Huang Guangyu’s office in previous reports. However, a former employee of Gome who had successfully &quot;climbed&quot; told a Southern Weekend reporter, &quot;Boss Huang also lives here, and there is a villa on the 36th floor that he renovated in a Chinese and Western style.&quot; If you want to climb to the 36th floor, You need to take the exclusive elevator. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“In the past, many employees came to ask for their wages and climbed up one level at a time, causing trouble twice. Later, in order to prevent people from going there again, we couldn’t enter that level.” Zhao Qiang remembered that there had been The supplier came to ask for payment, and squatted at the door of Pengrun Building until Huang Guangyu, and &quot;followed Boss Huang to the 36th floor, but I don&#39;t know how to deal with it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 30, many media reported the news that Daqing Gome suddenly closed down and nearly 20 home appliance dealers begged for payment but &quot;didn&#39;t know who to ask for it from.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the Judgment Documents Online, Gome was involved in 268 lawsuits in 2022, and this number reached 1,219 in 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This year’s lawsuits include an electrical equipment company in Foshan City, Guangdong Province requiring Foshan Gome Electric to pay a payment of 1.26 million yuan, a company in Zhejiang requiring Zhejiang Gome Electric to return rent and liquidated damages totaling 2.2 million yuan, and a construction company in Ningbo The decoration company requires Gome Electrical Appliances and Gome Retail to pay 2.4 million yuan for the project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was March and April 2022 when employees who resigned began to discover problems in the company. &quot;The biggest problem is the funding problem, which means we can&#39;t settle the account,&quot; Zhao Qiang told a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A former employee who was directly involved in Gome’s sales and purchase still remembers that in the past, his work did not require consideration of billing issues, but starting in 2022, he was in a “pay here, then that” situation. I just can’t pay” situation. &quot;It&#39;s very intuitive to feel that cash flow is very tight.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, he checked Gome&#39;s daily sales. &quot;I remember that the daily sales at that time could still reach tens of millions to 100 million or even higher, so I personally felt that it would not be overwhelming, but I don&#39;t know where the money went when it came back.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;At the beginning of 2022, &quot;employees&#39; basic salary is still there, but the performance part is rarely paid&quot;, and the situation gradually becomes more and more serious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2022, at an all-staff meeting held in Pengrun Building, Huang Xiuhong, chairman of Gome Electric Appliances, publicly stated, “The company will only provide social security to employees and will not pay wages until the end of December. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gome also requires employees to sign a commitment letter, which mentions that “starting from October 2022, we understand that the company may delay the payment of employee wages in the next six months to one year... Commitment adjustment Have a positive attitude and believe in the company... As employees, we promise to work hard, deliver business results on time, with high quality and quantity, and achieve performance goals.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I also read this commitment letter at the time. If I don&#39;t sign it, does it make sense that I still owe back wages?&quot; Zhao Qiang said that some employees have already had zero income for a year. After his salary appeal failed, Zhao Qiang also filed for arbitration. According to the judgment, Gome owed him more than 200,000 yuan in salary plus provident fund. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another manager of a relevant Gome department told a reporter from Southern Weekend, &quot;I am not owed wages, but all the children under me are owed wages. 200,000 yuan is a lot.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is even more unacceptable to Zhao Qiang is that starting from May 2022, Gome will no longer pay social security provident funds for its employees. &quot;But our personal contribution was deducted, and the company did not hand it over to the Provident Fund Management Center. This is the case for all employees.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This is equivalent to using our money, but we don’t know where it was used. .&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An employee of the Lianyungang branch of Gome Electric Co., Ltd. told a Southern Weekend reporter, &quot;Since October 2022, we have realized that Gome has begun to have financial problems because wages have not been paid on time. , it was postponed until the store closed in March this year.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The employees all filed for arbitration, but they did not have much confidence. &quot;There is no money in Gome&#39;s account, so it will end in vain.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gome Electric Appliances has 3,895 chain stores and more than 200 million members across the country. However, starting in 2023, news of Gome store closings appeared one after another. In October, some media reported that all Gome stores in Guangdong were closed. Later, the company responded that not all Gome stores were closed. However, published data showed that Gome reduced its self-operated stores in Guangdong Province by 12 in the third quarter. There are 74 franchise stores. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gome employees and consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, Lianyungang and other places also told Southern Weekend reporters that Gome stores in their cities are also gradually closing. Many interviewees said, “Gome stores across the country are basically closed.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the process of store closures, situations that were unacceptable to consumers emerged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A consumer in Shanghai purchased a 7,200 yuan washing machine at the Shanghai Gome Changning Head Office in December 2022. Gome did not deliver the goods and did not refund the money. The consumer sued Gome and then mediated. Gome promised Refunds will be issued before August 2023, but there has been no news so far. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Although I know that Huang Guangyu has been in and out of prison, it does not affect my shopping at Gome. I have never thought about not shipping the goods after paying,&quot; the above-mentioned consumer told the Southern Weekend reporter. Among the thousands of lawsuits involving Gome in 2023, there are a large number of similar sales disputes, employee wage arrears lawsuits, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the funding problem, in Zhao Qiang’s impression, the second change in the company is the frequent changes of direct leaders, which means that there is a problem in the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to incomplete statistics from Southern Weekend reporters, dozens of core executives including the former Gome Online CEO, Gome Electrical Appliances CEO, and Gome Retail President have resigned since 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Yuan&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;How did you get to where you are today&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Huang Guangyu was born in Chaoshan, Guangdong, and is 54 years old. According to official information from Gome Group, Huang Guangyu established the first &quot;Gome Electrical Appliances Store&quot; with an area of ​​less than 100 square meters on Zhushikou Street, Qianmen, Beijing, in 1987. Gome&#39;s retail road officially started. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1990, Gome tried a new supply and marketing model, breaking away from middlemen and directly underwriting customization with manufacturers, launching a &quot;direct sales&quot; home appliance model. In 1993, Gome unified its store names, product display methods, store after-sales services, and publicity, becoming the prototype of China&#39;s retail chain model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2004, Gome Electric Appliances was successfully listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange through a backdoor approach. Huang Guangyu used this to reach the top of the Hurun Report as the richest man in mainland China with a net worth of tens of billions, and he aspired to the top spot again in 2005 and 2008. , personal wealth once reached 45 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In November 2008, Huang Guangyu, who was at his peak, was detained by the police on suspicion of economic crimes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two years later, Huang Guangyu was sentenced to 14 years in prison for illegal business crimes, insider trading and unit bribery. In June 2020, the Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People&#39;s Court ruled that Huang Guangyu should be paroled in accordance with the law. In February 2021, Huang Guangyu was officially released from prison after serving his sentence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/qHZYecYdZ7CXsA6rbq10BtLrX0iwfuC3R4DNFtfG.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/qHZYecYdZ7CXsA6rbq10BtLrX0iwfuC3R4DNFtfG.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256384&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Huang Guangyu’s past honors are still on display at the Gome headquarters. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Mei Ling/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhao Qiang joined Gome the second month after Huang Guangyu was released from prison. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I have some understanding of Gome’s glory days, and I think its foundation is pretty good and its market share is huge. At that time, I thought that after Boss Huang came out, he would definitely have some new measures and methods that would bring Gome to the forefront. After vigorously developing it again and combining it with my resume, I joined.&quot; He told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Huang Guangyu returned in 2021, he first renamed Gome APP &quot;True Happiness&quot; as the &quot;total platform&quot; of Gome&#39;s retail ecosystem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to past media reports, when Huang Guangyu was in prison, he still communicated with company executives by writing letters. Gome executives even used drawings in their letters to try to make Huang Guangyu understand intelligence. The principles of mobile phones and APPs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Zhao Qiang said frankly, &quot;Until the day I resigned, I didn&#39;t know what the positioning of this APP was.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the &quot;True Happiness&quot; platform, there are three major scenes: competition venues, shows, and entertainment venues, as well as multiple sections such as content sharing communities, short video live broadcasts, event lists, and e-commerce shopping platforms. gather. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhao Qiang doesn’t know how to position this APP. Is it a community e-commerce, a hobby e-commerce, or a traditional e-commerce? In his opinion, this APP, which the boss has put all his efforts into, has no core and focus from design, product production to experience, which has a negative impact on communication. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This is a problem for decision-makers.” However, Zhao Qiang also mentioned that by the beginning of 2022, the basic functions of the “True Happiness” platform will already be in place, and consumers can buy things and return goods normally. . As long as there is a burst point in one plate, this route can still be followed after the overall tilt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The serious internal friction within Gome made him begin to doubt the company&#39;s prospects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He gave an example. Generally, the supply chain of e-commerce platforms is relatively concentrated, but within Gome, there are several companies that are engaged in supply chain at the same time. The same product of a brand may cooperate with many supply chain companies in Gome.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These supply chain companies have only one output port, which is the &quot;True Happiness&quot; APP. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This brings a huge waste of manpower. Each supply chain company has dozens or even hundreds of people, but multiple teams do repetitive work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Every team must survive. Everyone is constantly asking for money from the group and dividing it up. The boss may want to compete, but this kind of competition is not external, it is scattered and internal.&quot; Zhao Qiang Speaking to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gome has also built a shared and co-construction platform internally that is not open to the outside world. Small businesses and suppliers can access this system after paying a certain usage fee. &quot;The biggest problem with this platform is that no one uses it. If merchants want to open a store, they can just open a store on another platform.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the &quot;True Happy&quot; APP, Huang Guangyu has also continued to It has launched a number of apps such as &quot;Decorate Home&quot; and &quot;Zheshangzhe&quot;, which puzzled the market. &lt; /p>; &lt;p>;A mid-level person from Gome Group told Southern Weekend reporters, “In addition to the decision-making issues of company leaders and lack of understanding of the market environment, they are also affected by the epidemic.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《Chinese Enterprises Home&quot; reported that in late October 2021, on the 36th floor of the Pengrun Building, Gome held high-level meetings for five consecutive days. Huang Guangyu was sitting in the main seat, but staring at the iPad lying flat on the table, playing the game &quot; angry Birds&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhao Qiang said, &quot;Sometimes Boss Huang sleeps during the day, and meetings are held late at night, and the executives go crazy.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Can it still be &quot;resurrected&quot;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters contacted a retired vice president-level executive about Gome’s current situation, but the other party refused to discuss the matter. In addition, all members of the public relations department of Gome Group have resigned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, the domestic official website of Gome Group cannot be opened, and the “Dressing Home” and “Zheshangzhe” apps have been removed from the Apple App Store. After spending a huge amount of promotion fees, in January 2023, “True Happiness” changed its name back to “Gome” APP. At present, some brands of Gome APP have been withdrawn, and some categories such as TVs and refrigerators have been removed from the shelves. In addition, the live broadcast sales list is blank, the cleaning, repair and other services that could have been provided have been deactivated, and no one has responded to customer service. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the financial report, in the first half of 2023, Gome’s retail revenue was 415 million yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 95.74%; it achieved a net loss attributable to the parent company of 3.539 billion yuan. During the same period, Gome Retail&#39;s current assets were only 5.326 billion yuan, and cash and cash equivalents were 146 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Gome Retail’s total liability balance is as high as 37.313 billion yuan, with an asset-liability ratio of 106.55%, making the company insolvent. Among them, current liabilities were 36.106 billion yuan, accounting for 96.78%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, starting from the second half of 2021, Huang Guangyu and Du Juan have frequently reduced their holdings of Gome retail stocks, from 60.98% of their holdings at the end of 2021 to the current 10.79%. Cashed out nearly HK$2 billion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2021, when Huang Guangyu was officially released from prison after serving his sentence, Gome’s stock price experienced a surge. It was once nicknamed the “release concept stock” by the market. As of press time, Gome’s retail stock price was only The remaining price is 0.037 yuan per share, which is 97% lower than when he was released from prison. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;In the past ten years, Gome&#39;s development strategy has been mainly reflected in two words - conservative, and try not to spend as much money as possible. This is Du Juan&#39;s point of view.&quot; Liu Buchen believes that in e-commerce, In an era of dominance, the decline of traditional home appliance chains is inevitable. It is just a matter of speed or slowness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in the eyes of former employees, the decline and end may be more dignified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhao Qiang sighed, &quot;Looking back, I feel regretful. We joined Gome in the hope of helping the former myth to reshape another myth. You gave me the opportunity and I contributed my ability, but now it is difficult to come back to life. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/gs8kFYyE5HhpP4GeCU4CIBL2FXr70QkUaQp1jN3g.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/gs8kFYyE5HhpP4GeCU4CIBL2FXr70QkUaQp1jN3g.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256385&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Gome&#39;s headquarters office remains in the Christmas atmosphere of 2022. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Mei Ling/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(should At the request of the interviewee, Zhao Qiang is a pseudonym in the article.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[海上危机专家谈：“我们需要的不是排外战略，而是包容的战略”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259713]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In recent years, the ocean has become an emerging development space that countries are paying attention to, and a new ocean order is taking shape. At the same time, new issues such as maritime military crises and marine ecological security have also emerged. Are we ready for the new order? How should maritime disputes be managed? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Now that we are entering a new maritime order, we should do our best to maintain maritime security and avoid entering a state of disorder.” Jayanath Colombaj, former commander of the Sri Lanka Navy, said. He believes that many countries rely on the ocean, and people need an interconnected system for ocean governance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 30, 2023, at the Beijing Xiangshan Forum &quot;Maritime Military Crisis Prevention and Control&quot; group meeting, many Chinese and foreign scholars conducted in-depth discussions on issues such as maritime crises, maritime risks, maritime order and rules, etc. Discuss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/5b6586d3f0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/5b6586d3f0.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256367&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 30, 2023, a number of Chinese and foreign scholars held discussions at the Xiangshan Forum in Beijing around &quot;Maritime Military Crisis Prevention and Control.&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Yao Yijiang/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Conflict-prone Period&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Today&#39;s world is facing tremendous changes, and maritime security issues have been affected A variety of factors influence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Retired Lieutenant General Ding Yiping, former deputy commander of the People’s Liberation Army Navy, judged: “Various risk factors are superimposed, linked, and amplified, and the maritime situation is affected by them and enters a period of conflict-prone situations.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“On the one hand, there are traditional maritime security issues, sovereignty disputes, usage disputes, resource development, fishery and other issues.” Ding Yiping mentioned, “On the one hand, there are at least 60 countries involved in maritime usage disputes alone. More than 200 maritime disputes have arisen.” On the other hand, “criminal activities such as piracy, robbery, and terrorist attacks occur frequently.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We are living in a maritime crisis.” Jayanath Colombaj is a retired lieutenant general and former commander of the Sri Lanka Navy. He is particularly concerned about maritime security issues in the Indian Ocean and its littoral countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Indian Ocean is the third largest ocean in the world, rich in fish and seaweed resources, and maritime trade is very developed. However, Colombaj noted that countries surrounding the Indian Ocean are still troubled by security issues, &quot;human trafficking, illegal immigration at sea They all occurred in the Indian Ocean, posing a great threat to the maritime order. In addition, there are a large number of military operations in the Indian Ocean,&quot; Colombaj said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the increasing security crisis, the deterioration of the marine ecological environment has increasingly become a problem for marine governance. In recent years, climate change has led to frequent marine disasters. Melting glaciers, rising sea levels, and rising ocean surface temperatures have caused serious harm to marine and coastal ecosystems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ding Yiping said, &quot;Some countries discharge industrial sewage and dump garbage into the ocean, resulting in seawater pollution and serious damage to marine ecology, while disorderly and uncontrolled development has caused the rapid decline of marine resources.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;The Indian Ocean that Colombaj is concerned about is also facing ecological damage. &quot;There is a 60,000 square kilometers area in the southern Indian Ocean, and there is a large area of ​​garbage.&quot; Colombaj is worried that if it is not dealt with in time, the environmental problems in the Indian Ocean will become more and more serious. serious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind the frequent maritime security issues, there are also more complex national games, which are not easy to solve. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ding Yiping said, “Because maritime disputes involve historical roots, national sentiments, economic and security interests, the countries involved are unwilling to compromise, and some major foreign countries intervene in other countries’ disputes for their own interests, resulting in disputes and confrontations. It has seriously affected the security and stability of some regions.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Colombaj said that whether it is marine security management or marine environmental governance, countries are facing cooperation difficulties. &quot;There are several major obstacles to ocean governance, including a lack of trust, a lack of financial resources, a lack of political vision among leaders, a lack of public awareness, and a lack of broad policies,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;New Maritime Order&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Currently, there are many &quot;strategies&quot; regarding the Indian Ocean. Colombaj believes that these strategies have led to strategic competition, strategic tightening, strategic dilemmas and strategic differences among a large number of countries surrounding the Indian Ocean, making the Indian Ocean unsafe. Similar to these strategies, there are a large number of joint initiatives in the Indian Ocean region, many of which remain on paper. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Why do we, a small country, need so many strategies? What goals are these strategies going to achieve? Can they bring great development to the Indian Ocean region?&quot; Colombaj believes that these strategies are about &quot;order and rules.&quot; The definition is controversial; what the Indian Ocean needs is not an exclusive strategy, but an inclusive strategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;When things go in the wrong direction, we can look back to the starting point. For example, with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea adopted in 1982, we need to return to the original consensus.&quot; Colombaj believes that many The country relies on the ocean, and people need an interconnected system for ocean governance. For example, &quot;sustainable and integrated ocean governance and enforcement are needed&quot; and &quot;military means cannot be used once a dispute arises on the ocean.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He called on governments, non-governmental organizations, business and the private sector to unite together, because &quot;we can go fast alone, but we can go far together&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We often hear that we live in an unpredictable world. Yet it is our (researchers’) job to anticipate the ‘unpredictable’. Now, we are entering a new ocean order. To prevent There is disorder, and we need to find order in disorder,” Colombaj said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Retired Lieutenant General Shekhar Sinha, former Chief of the Joint Defense Staff of India, believes that after the end of the Cold War, more and more countries have improved their economies and strengthened their military strength, and the center of gravity of the balance of world power has shifted from the West to the East. , which in turn brings more great power competition. &quot;The intensity of military conflicts at sea will increase and will continue,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shekhar is worried that violations in the military field will inevitably draw out the military, especially at sea, such as warship collisions. At the same time, the operation of military or military assets overseas involves disputes over maritime jurisdiction. The parties involved’s different understandings of history, regulations, conventions, etc. will also intensify the disputes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shekhar proposed that global commerce is very important and conflicts should not affect the navigation of commercial ships. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said that only 10%-15% of the world&#39;s ships are warships, and the rest are commercial ships. Whenever the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is violated or violated, there must be a global warning and a law enforcement mechanism to stop such violations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Warships account for a very small proportion of global ships. We must abide by relevant rules and protect commerce and trade. Conflicts between major powers are more reflected in maritime conflicts than trade conflicts.&quot; He said . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The &quot;China Plan&quot; for Crisis Management&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Ding Yiping said that the focus of the maritime security concept advocated by China can be summarized into three aspects - jointly safeguarding maritime and territorial security, and jointly responding to Maritime security threats, respect the maritime rights and interests of all countries, and oppose maritime hegemony. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Most of the ocean is public domain, and its security needs to be safeguarded by all countries in the world.” Ding Yiping proposed that we must maintain the maritime order based on international law, respect the peaceful maritime interests of all parties, and oppose the use of The oceans contain, contain, and suppress other countries, and use conflicts in other countries’ maritime interests to stir up trouble. Practice has proven that only by trusting each other, strengthening communication, active cooperation, positive interaction, and joint maintenance can we effectively ensure maritime security and maximize common interests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, how to prevent and control maritime military crises? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ding Yiping proposed that the first suggestion is to announce a strategy to prevent maritime disputes from escalating out of control and to stop inappropriate behavior by maritime military forces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The current extraterritorial maritime military forces, dominated by the United States, conduct high-frequency reconnaissance, surveillance, and measurement activities in the waters surrounding China, especially the provocative acts against sovereignty in the South China Sea and the East China Sea, to control the intensity of the crisis. The increase has posed a serious obstacle to the prevention and control of maritime crises,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, U.S. warships have frequently transited the Taiwan Strait, stimulating tensions in the Taiwan Strait and constantly provoking China. Zhang Yazhong, the president of Sun Wen School in Taiwan, spoke at the meeting and said that the most fundamental and necessary way to establish a cross-strait military mutual trust mechanism, or to prevent and manage cross-strait maritime military crises, is that both sides of the strait must have a &quot;political consensus.&quot; Taiwan should return to the position of the &#39;1992 Consensus&#39;.&quot; He expressed the hope that both sides of the Taiwan Strait would have the wisdom to get rid of foreign influence, and that the two sides would resolve cross-Strait political and military problems on their own and work together to create peace across the Strait. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend interns Zhai Huan and Bao Jingyue also contributed to this article)&lt;/span>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 18:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[保障“外嫁女”合法权益，最高检、全国妇联联合发布6件典型案例]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259736]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 18:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;On November 1, the Supreme People’s Procuratorate and the All-China Women’s Federation jointly issued a Typical cases of administrative prosecution of legal rights and interests in land. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;There are a total of 6 typical cases in this batch, including the case of Zhi Moulan v. the Natural Resources and Planning Bureau of a certain city in Shandong Province for collective land registration inspection and supervision, and Zhang Moujia v. a certain person in Jiangsu Province.

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;检察机关经审查认为，本案为土地承包经营权争议，不属于人民政府土地权属争议受案范围，终审判决并无不当。但某社区未经张某甲等法定继承人同意，以自然闭户处理收回案涉土地，侵犯了张某甲等人的继承权，且张某甲户口迁回某社区后，作为村民亦应享有相应宅基地使用权。案涉争议持续近十年，历经多轮诉讼，张某甲的合法权益一直未能得到有效维护，且有引发新诉讼的可能，两级检察机关遂决定一体开展化解工作，彻底解决其多年“程序空转”难题。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;某市人民检察院致函某镇人民政府，指出张某甲权益受到侵害客观存在，镇政府应重视张某甲合理诉求，处理好当事人房屋土地问题，避免争议激化上行，保障妇女合法权益。同时，向当地妇联通报该案情况，共同至某镇政府开展化解工作。镇政府充分听取检察机关和妇联意见后，召集政法综治中心、某社区等部门商讨解决方案，最终确定张某甲可凭村民资格，以拆迁安置价格购买一套安置房用于解决居住问题。同时，检察机关向张某甲说明重新建房已不现实，应尽早从诉累中解脱，开始新生活。张某甲感受到人民政府的诚意，同意某镇政府方案。 2022年10月11日，张某甲与某镇政府签订和解协议，张某甲向检察机关撤回监督申请。该案的行政争议与民事纠纷得到实质性化解。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;【典型意义】&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;新修订的《中华人民共和国妇女权益保障法》规定，妇女在土地承包经营、宅基地使用等方面，享有与男子平等的权利。涉及村民利益事项的决定，不得以妇女未婚、结婚、离婚、丧偶、户无男性等为由，侵害妇女在农村集体经济组织中的各项权益。在办理争议历时长、关联诉讼多、民行交叉的涉损害“外嫁女”权益案件时，检察机关针对“案结事不了、程序空转”等问题，坚持人民至上、检察为民，聚焦群众急难愁盼问题，准确把握法律关系实质，统筹考虑法理情，综合运用实地走访、工作函告、协同属地妇联共同化解争议等方式“一揽子”化解行政争议与民事纠纷，切实维护农村妇女的合法权益，促进社会公平正义。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;2022年3月29日，某区人民检察院向某自然资源和规划分局发出检察建议书，建议该局：1. 对“外嫁女”进行补偿安置时，要充分保障妇女合法权益，以是否依法登记所在地常住户口作为形式要件，以是否实际在本集体经济组织生产生活为实质要件，综合判断其是否具有集体经济组织成员资格。 2. 对“外嫁女”是否按单独一户进行补偿安置，制定统一的补偿认定标准。 3. 完善行政应诉机制，提升依法行政水平，维护政府公信力。检察建议发出后，某区人民检察院与某自然资源和规划分局、某区妇联多次召开联席会，交流意见，共商整改重点。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;2022年4月27日，某自然资源和规划分局书面回复，表示进一步完善征地拆迁安置政策和补偿认定标准；严格落实“三轮会审”机制，及时梳理总结涉拆案件情况；提升自身应诉能力水平。 2022年5月，某自然资源和规划分局制定新的《征拆安置政策和补偿认定标准》手册，对“外嫁女”制定了统一的身份认定、户型认定的补偿标准，按单独一户标准对符合规定的王某等“外嫁女”及其子女计算安置补偿费。聘请4名专职律师负责行政应诉工作，从源头堵塞行政应诉不规范问题。某区人民检察院与某区妇联会签《检察监督保障妇女权益协作配合机制意见》，在线索移送、支持起诉、行政争议化解、司法救助等多方面达成合作意见，建立长效机制。 2022年6月以来，该区未再发生因“外嫁女”补偿安置标准不统一而引发的行政诉讼。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;检察机关由该案进一步推动行政机关制定科学、合法、可行的土地征收安置补偿政策。目前，某区政府已修订土地征收安置补偿方案，涉“外嫁女”安置政策得以调整。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;【典型意义】&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;男女平等是我国的基本国策。党的二十大报告强调“坚持男女平等基本国策，保障妇女儿童合法权益”，充分彰显党中央对妇女儿童事业发展的高度重视。新修订的《中华人民共和国妇女权益保障法》也要求检察机关在履职中加强对妇女权益的保护。检察机关在履职过程中，坚持问题导向，针对将“外嫁女”土地征收安置补偿权益排除在外，违反男女平等基本国策及相关法律规定的现象，通过一体化办案、成立联合办案组、院领导包案、府检联动、法检联动等方式，依法开展监督，妥善化解争议，有效维护妇女合法权益。同时，通过案件办理，推动地方政府在行政管理中重视妇女权益保障，完善土地征收安置补偿政策，有力提升社会治理法治化水平。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;据了解，近期一款名为“萝卜刀”的新型玩具在中小学生（幼儿）群体中走红。该玩具是一种外形酷似胡萝卜的彩色塑料玩具刀，由于该玩具本身具有攻击性，存在一定的安全隐患，又会形成心理暗示，激发孩子暴力倾向，对未成年人安全健康成长产生不良影响。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为此，广东省教育厅要求，加强对学生的安全教育。各地各校（园）要进一步加大安全教育力度，让学生（幼儿）认识到“萝卜刀”等玩具的危险性，自觉拒绝“萝卜刀”等危险性有害玩具，做到不购买、不携带、不玩耍。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;加强对家长的安全提醒。要采取多种形式提醒家长认真履行监护责任，务必选择正规厂商出产的、适合孩子年龄阶段、有益身心健康发展的儿童和学生用品，不要为孩子购买“萝卜刀”等危险性有害玩具。在玩具使用前，要仔细阅读包装上的警告和提醒内容，做好孩子使用时的安全防范。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;严格对校园的安全管理。各中小学校、幼儿园要严禁此类危险性有害玩具进入校园，在进行安全教育的基础上，对仍带入校园的此类有害玩具，要清查封存。被封存的危险性有害玩具，要通知学生（幼儿）家长到学校接受教育，在作出承诺之后可由家长领回，并督促其销毁。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;加强对校园及周边的治理。学校要管好校园内商店，不得售卖此类危险性有害玩具。要关注校园周边商店，发现有售卖此类危险性有害玩具的，要报告属地市场监管等职能部门，由职能部门查处。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;各地教育部门要会同相关部门深入开展儿童和学生用品安全治理，以“萝卜刀”等存在物理危害、化学危害、可燃性危害、心理暗示等危险性有害玩具产品为重点，加大校园周边商铺和流动摊贩管理力度，一旦发现存在售卖危险性玩具产品和学生用品的，要严肃查处。各地级以上市教育局于11月10日前，将排查治理工作情况反馈省教育厅。 &lt;/p>;
