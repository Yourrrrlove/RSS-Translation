On the morning of September 12, 2023, Mao Lixin, a lawyer at Beijing Shangquan Law Firm, noticed a piece of news: the Supreme People&#39;s Court, the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, the Ministry of Public Security, and the Ministry of Justice jointly issued the &quot;Notice on Carrying out Special Work to Promote the Increase in the Rate of Second Instance Trials in Criminal Cases&quot; 》, this work has been carried out since September 1. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the requirements of the notice, it is necessary to improve the overall low rate of second-instance hearings of criminal cases, promote the establishment of a regular mechanism to increase the rate of second-instance hearings of criminal cases, and give full play to the importance of court trials in ascertaining facts and identifying evidence. effect. The &quot;two highs and two ministries&quot; will carry out a one-year special work to promote the increase in the rate of second instance hearings of criminal cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This is a great benefit for lawyers.” Mao Lixin sighed. Five months ago, he participated in a seminar on the difficulties of opening a second trial. At the meeting, he said that except for the cases he represented in the first instance, he basically did not take on criminal second-instance cases. &quot;If there is no trial, there is very little room for lawyers to perform.&quot; This statement resonated with the lawyers present. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mao Lixin plans to start acting as an agent in second-instance criminal cases if the difficulty of opening a second-instance trial cannot be alleviated. &quot;At least I will have a starting point for my work.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/NT944p2PXwAmylBUIwd2Dp1SLgMdA2liQC4Aqe5T.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height= &quot;865&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/NT944p2PXwAmylBUIwd2Dp1SLgMdA2liQC4Aqe5T.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250674&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 19, 2023, the second trial of the &quot;Wu Xieyu Patricide Case&quot; opened. On that day, citizens passed by the electronic bulletin board of the Fuzhou Intermediate People&#39;s Court. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(People&#39;s Vision/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The court opening rate in some places has increased by 75%&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p >;The low rate of criminal second instance hearings has become a common feeling among lawyers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The book &quot;40 Years of China&#39;s Criminal Procedure Legal System&quot; edited by Sun Changyong, chair professor of Kaiyuan Law School of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, provides data support for this: In 2013, the rate of criminal second instance hearings exceeded 40%, and in 2014 From 2016 to 2016, it basically remained between 30% and 40%. However, since 2017, this figure has dropped below 20%, showing an overall downward trend year by year. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The COVID-19 epidemic has also affected the rate of second instance hearings to a certain extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2022, the Henan Provincial High Court issued a reply to the proposal of the Provincial Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference. It mentioned that local courts usually give priority to ensuring the hearing needs of first-instance cases and death penalty, suspended death, and second-instance protest cases. The court hearing resources of other second-instance cases have been squeezed out, and the second-instance hearing rate in some prefectures and cities has dropped by nearly 10% compared with before the epidemic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Southern Weekend reporters noticed that since 2023, before the issuance of the above notice, the local court has begun to explore. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to public reports, on February 14, 2023, Hao Zhuo, deputy director of the Fourth Criminal Division of the Henan Provincial High Court, went to Pingdingshan Intermediate Court to investigate the situation of the second criminal trial; on March 8, Hao Zhuo et al. People also went to Puyang Intermediate People&#39;s Court to conduct special research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the investigation, Hao Zhuo mentioned that the work of increasing the rate of second instance hearings is based on the work arrangements made by the Central Committee and the Supreme People&#39;s Court on the reform of the criminal litigation system. &quot;The court session is an exception&quot; principle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 25, 2023, the Xuchang Intermediate Court of Henan Province published an article, which mentioned that the Xuchang Intermediate People’s Court and the Xuchang Procuratorate jointly signed an &quot;Opinions on Increasing the Hearing Rate of Criminal Second Instance Cases&quot; 》. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to data released by the Supreme People&#39;s Court, since 2023, as of August 31, the second-instance hearing rate of criminal cases in Henan, Shaanxi, and Hunan courts has increased by more than 75% year-on-year, and the rate of second-instance hearings in Fujian, Chongqing, and Heilongjiang courts has increased by more than 75% year-on-year. 50%, and the courts of Beijing, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Gansu, and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps increased by more than 10% year-on-year. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The &quot;change rate&quot; is low, &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;the actual effect remains to be seen&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This notice points out that investigation and research must be carried out. Analyze various reasons that affect the low rate of second-instance hearings, take effective measures to reduce the adverse factors that affect the second-instance hearing rate, and ensure that the rate of second-instance hearings increases steadily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2020, the Jinhua Intermediate People&#39;s Court admitted in response to the suggestion of a National People&#39;s Congress deputy that the reason for the decline in the rate of criminal second instance hearings is that the number of defendant cases has increased significantly in recent years. It is difficult for police personnel to meet the needs of court sessions; prosecutors cannot meet the needs of second-instance criminal trials; and post judges are under heavy pressure to open trials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tian Yuan, associate professor at Tianjin University Law School, has been engaged in trial work in grassroots, intermediate and above courts for more than ten years. He also found in his research that, faced with increasingly heavy case-handling pressure, second-instance judges tend to make the choice not to hold court sessions. When hearing criminal cases of second instance, a collegial panel should be formed, and the number of second-instance judges is relatively limited. In order to form a collegial panel, one has to frequently go to the civil court, commercial court, or administrative court to &quot;recruit reinforcements.&quot; Naturally, the effect of the case hearing and subsequent collegial proceedings will be greatly reduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Han Yi, dean of the Law School of Minzu University of China, has also previously written an article calling for the second instance of criminal cases to be heard. After seeing the notice jointly issued by the four departments, he believed that the statements contained in it are relatively principled, and specific details still need to be issued on how to implement it in practice. For example, Han Yi believes that there needs to be supporting policies to follow up on the allocation of judges. In addition, in practice, &quot;the circumstances under which a second instance hearing must be held and under which circumstances do not require a hearing need to be further refined, which will also be more conducive to implementation by the grassroots courts.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some lawyers also believe that given the low rate of criminal cases being revised and remanded for retrial (referred to as the &quot;reissue rate&quot;), it remains to be seen what the actual effect of the second instance hearing will be. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to data released by the Supreme People&#39;s Court, in the first half of 2023, the rate of change of first-instance criminal judgments in courts across the country was 1.65%, a year-on-year decrease of 0.22 percentage points. This means that among 100 criminal cases, the average number of cases whose sentences were changed after the first instance was less than 2. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 15, 2023, &quot;Ban Yue Tan&quot; published a report, pointing out that for a long time, courts in various places have used the low reissue rate of cases as an important indicator to evaluate the quality of cases handled by courts and judges, prompting the second-instance courts to Cautious changes to judgments and strict remands lead to &quot;not changing the sentences that should be changed.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“If we don’t increase the rate of reform, the value of supervision and check in the second instance will still not be realized.” Han Yi also believes that the issuance of this notice is worthy of praise. At the same time, the policy should also be paid attention to in subsequent practice. Whether the implementation is effective. In addition to the low reissue rate, Han Yi also mentioned that attention should be paid to avoid blindly focusing on increasing the second-instance hearing rate. “This may cause the second-instance court to choose to hear some relatively simple cases, while choosing to hear major and complex cases. No court session.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 14 Sep 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[从初代网红到二次出狱：郭美美曾说“不想以这种方式出名”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256605]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-13 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&quot;Slowly understand the world and slowly update yourself.&quot; On September 12, Guo, who has been silent for nearly three years, Meimei updated her personal social media account to show that she may be released from prison again. On the same day, Guo Meimei confirmed the matter to reporters from Nandu and N Video, saying that everything was fine now and she wanted to &quot;rest for a while first.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After returning to the social platform, she disbanded the fan group she formed. The million-fan account she created after her first release from prison now only has 6 Weibo posts left to view. Prior to this, Guo Meimei&#39;s last appearance was at a public court hearing in August 2021. In October of the same year, she was sentenced for selling poisonous and harmful food. This was the second time she was sentenced in a criminal case. She was sentenced to five years in prison for opening a casino and was released in July 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Twelve years ago, a modification of the authentication information made Guo Meimei become the first generation Internet celebrity, and she became famous for a while. At that time, Guo Meimei admitted in an interview with a reporter from Nandu that she had the desire to be famous, but &quot;don&#39;t want to be famous in this way.&quot; However, for more than ten years, words such as &quot;showing off wealth&quot;, &quot;going to jail&quot;, &quot;gambling&quot; and &quot;selling fake medicine&quot; have gradually become entangled with her name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/116df681e74128d4a9bca29fbe552420.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;437&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/116df681e74128d4a9bca29fbe552420.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;250672&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 12, Guo Meimei’s personal social account was updated after being discontinued for nearly three years. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Jailed for the second time&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On September 12, Guo Meimei’s personal social account, which has been disconnected for nearly three years, posted a new message - &quot;Slowly understand the world, slowly Update yourself slowly”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After announcing her return on social platforms, Guo Meimei’s first move was to disband her fan group. She once generously shared her updates in the fan group, and some fans said, &quot;We have been in the group for all these years, and then we disbanded the group.&quot; Regarding this, she explained, &quot;I had some ideas of my own, so I disbanded.&quot; Guo Meimei also told Nandu reporters that everything is fine now and she wants to &quot;rest for a while first.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guo Meimei’s last Weibo update was in December 2020, and her last public appearance was at a public trial two years ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 13, 2021, the first instance trial of Guo Meimei and others suspected of producing and selling toxic and harmful food was held in the Shanghai Railway Transport Court. Screenshots of the court hearing showed that the defendants Guo Meimei and Wang Zouya were brought into the court by bailiffs wearing protective clothing. During the statement stage, Guo Meimei shed tears and confessed. In the end, she wiped her tears with her hands and was taken away by the bailiff. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/482c73cce6e1a98a05c40064770e39c3.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;360&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/482c73cce6e1a98a05c40064770e39c3.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250671&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The court hearing scene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 18, the Shanghai Railway Transport Court publicly pronounced its verdict on the case of Guo Meimei and Wang Zouya selling toxic and harmful food in accordance with the law.

It attracted the attention of more than one million fans in just over a year. She sells goods through multiple channels by building a fan group and diverting traffic from Weibo to WeChat. &quot;Slimming&quot; is a word that often appears on her Weibo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guo Meimei’s high-profile actions attracted attention. In December 2020, the Economic Investigation Detachment of Shanghai Pudong Public Security Bureau received a clue that someone was selling fake weight loss pills online. The manufacturing and sales den promotes its products through online advertisements to attract beauty-loving women. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a report from the Shanghai police, on March 11, 2021, the Pudong police successfully detected a case of producing and selling weight-loss foods with banned ingredients (sibutramine), and arrested the production worker Guo Moumou (female, 30 years old) and other 32 criminal suspects have been detained in accordance with the law. Nandu reporters confirmed from authoritative sources close to the Shanghai police that the 30-year-old Guo Moumou involved in the report was none other than Guo Meimei. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The public prosecution agency accused Guo Meimei and Wang Zouya of knowingly knowing that the slimming candies sold at the premises of their previous owner Zhao (handled in a separate case) may illegally contain sibutramine since January and February 2021 respectively. Even under such circumstances, they are still sold at unit prices of 699 yuan per box. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Up to the time of the incident, Guo Meimei had sold more than 100 boxes of slimming candies and received more than 70,000 yuan in payment. During this period, Guo Meimei also helped Wang Zouya order and pay Zhao, and jointly sold 4 boxes of slimming candies, receiving RMB 2,796. After the incident, the public security organs detected sibutramine in the diet candy seized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the day of the first-instance trial, a relevant person from the prosecution revealed to Nandu reporters that before the trial, Guo Meimei had signed a confession of guilt and punishment. However, during the trial, Guo Meimei defended whether she “subjectively and knowingly” knew that the weight loss pills sold contained sibutramine. &quot;Whether this behavior constitutes &#39;repentance&#39; and whether it will be considered as a sentencing circumstance needs to be determined by the judge.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;First arrest&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When Guo Meimei was detained by Pudong police in accordance with the law, she was She was released from prison in Changsha only 607 days ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2014, Guo Meimei and others were criminally detained by the Dongcheng Branch of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau on suspicion of gambling crimes. After investigation, Guo Meimei confessed to the illegal and criminal facts of participating in gambling and organizing gambling during the World Cup football match, and also confessed to the criminal facts of long-term participation in gambling activities and opening gambling bureaus for making huge profits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Long-term gambling began in 2010, long before the &quot;Guo Meimei incident&quot; that made it famous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The police found that between 2010 and 2014, Guo Meimei traveled to and from Macau, Hong Kong and surrounding countries for gambling more than 60 times. At the end of 2012, Guo Meimei met Kang, a foreign professional Texas Hold&#39;em gambler, at a Macau casino. The two soon developed into lovers and lived together in Beijing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2013, Guo Meimei changed from gambling to gambling. In February of the same year, Guo Meimei and Kang planned to open a casino in Beijing.

Later, Guo Meimei personally called her friends to invite her to gamble. The first time, Guo Meimei invited 6 people, and she made a profit of 70,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guo Meimei was not satisfied with this. Her assistant at the time, Lu Moumou, once revealed that Guo Meimei felt that it was inadequate and said, &quot;A woman still has to be in charge. Next time I will set up the card game myself.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, Guo Meimei hired a professional dealer every time, found someone to be responsible for settling gambling funds, and called or sent WeChat messages to invite &quot;friends&quot; to come and gamble. She herself took 3% to 5%. Rebate points are used as &quot;water money&quot;. According to verification by the Beijing police, the amount of money Guo Meimei opened in each gambling game was more than one million yuan, and she personally made hundreds of thousands of yuan in illegal profits through &quot;extracting money.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2014, the 20th World Cup opened.

The amount involved in the case exceeded 50 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, the account &quot;Guo Mei May works hard&quot; only has 6 Weibo posts left to view. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Twelve years ago, a change in authentication information brought the Weibo account &quot;Guo Meimei Baby&quot; into the public eye. On June 20, 2011, Guo Meimei, whose certification information is &quot;Commercial General Manager of the Red Cross Society of China&quot;, showed off her luxurious life on Weibo, claiming to &quot;live in a big villa and drive a Maserati&quot;, causing an uproar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Red Cross Society of China clarified that there is no &quot;Red Cross Chamber of Commerce&quot; organization, let alone &quot;Guo Meimei&quot;, but doubts still arise one after another. Affected by this, one month after the incident, the charitable donations received by the Red Cross societies across China dropped sharply, and their credibility was questioned. Other official charities were also implicated. The amount of donations received by charitable organizations dropped by 86% from June to August. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 4, 2011, Guo Meimei apologized in tears on a TV show, saying that she certified the &quot;Commercial General Manager of the Red Cross Society of China&quot; out of vanity and comparison mentality, and emphasized that everything had nothing to do with the Red Cross Society. . However, a charity trust storm has formed, and a round of discussion on charity system reform has arisen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an interview with a Nandu reporter in the same year, Guo Meimei said that before the incident happened, she &quot;didn&#39;t know much about charity&quot;. She only heard about &quot;godfather&quot; Wang Jun at a dinner in March and April. The name &quot;Commercial General Manager of the Red Cross Society of China&quot; was mentioned. One afternoon in April, Guo Meimei saw the Weibo posts of friends she followed. The certification information said president and general manager, “But I know there are a few people who are not. One of them, a classmate in our class, just took 100,000 yuan to register.

Influenza, this familiar “old friend” will also arrive as scheduled. Most people don&#39;t think of the flu as a serious illness. The typical symptoms of a sore throat, runny nose, and muscle aches are often the same as a bad cold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the COVID-19 epidemic, influenza was the first infectious disease to be monitored globally by the World Health Organization (WHO). According to WHO statistics, seasonal influenza kills 290,000 to 650,000 people every year. Part of the reason why influenza is so destructive is that the virus mutates quickly, and people who have been infected with influenza viruses in the past cannot develop defenses against new viruses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In our country, influenza is a seriously underestimated infectious disease. A large number of people are infected with influenza every year, and the health risks and disease burden it brings are far greater than imagined. A meta-analysis by scholars on the results of influenza epidemiological surveys conducted in different cities in my country in different years concluded that the annual number of influenza cases in China from 2011 to 2019 was approximately 84 million to 144 million. From the 2010-2011 to 2014-2015 epidemic season, there were an average of 88,000 excess deaths from influenza-related respiratory diseases in my country every year, of which 80% of the excess influenza-related deaths among the elderly over 60 years old accounted for the entire population. The risk of illness in children is about 1.5-3 times that of adults; pregnant women infected with influenza during pregnancy increase the risk of severe illness and stillbirth. A systematic review analyzed the economic burden caused by influenza in my country. Among them, outpatient cases in all age groups were 768-1,000 yuan/person, inpatient cases averaged 9,832 yuan/person, and direct medical care for children 5 years old and under and elderly people over 60 years old for inpatient cases. The cost is much higher than other groups. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike many new infectious diseases, influenza scientists are already very familiar with it. The World Health Organization updates the antigenic components of influenza vaccines every year based on global surveillance and provides candidate strains for vaccine preparation. , for industry to develop the latest influenza vaccines. Although the mutation of new strains causes fluctuations in the effectiveness of influenza vaccines, vaccination is still the most cost-effective way to prevent influenza and complications. WHO recommends that countries set vaccination rate targets for recommended vaccination groups such as the elderly. 75%. In my country, the influenza vaccination rate is only 2%-4%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The status of influenza vaccination in my country is very unsatisfactory.” Peng Zhibin, associate researcher at the Infectious Disease Management Division of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, disclosed at the 2022 National Vaccine and Health Conference that during the 2021~2022 influenza season, vaccines The vaccination rate was only 2.46%, a year-on-year decrease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because the vaccination rate is too low, the annual scrap rate of corporate influenza vaccines is as high as 20%-40%. How to improve the vaccination rate of influenza vaccine in my country and protect the public health has been a difficult problem that has long troubled public health researchers. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Three major factors&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Recently, the team of Professor Feng Luzhao, deputy dean of the School of Group Medicine and Public Health of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, conducted a study on influenza vaccination in my country. The current situation and problems are summarized, and a series of strategic suggestions are put forward to promote influenza vaccination in my country. This article was published on September 12, 2023 as the output of the &quot;Vaccine Delivery Research Innovation Laboratory&quot; project at Duke Kunshan University . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What factors influence the low influenza vaccination rate? Professor Feng Luzhao’s research pointed out that three factors affect my country’s influenza vaccination rate:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, vaccine hesitancy caused by cognitive misunderstandings about influenza viruses and influenza vaccines. The survey shows that &quot;thinking that you are in good health and do not need to get a flu vaccine&quot; and &quot;even if you get the flu will not cause serious consequences&quot; are the main reasons for people&#39;s flu vaccine hesitancy; more than 40% of public health personnel believe that the flu will not cause serious consequences. disease, 18% of public health workers and 45% of medical workers said they lacked confidence in answering questions about influenza vaccines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, the cost is closely related to the influenza vaccination rate. In my country, the influenza vaccine is a non-immunization program vaccine and needs to be vaccinated at your own expense. In recent years, some provinces and cities have included influenza vaccines as local free services, which has greatly increased the vaccination rate in some areas. According to a survey by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the vaccination rate of people in areas with free influenza vaccination can exceed 50%, and the medical insurance reimbursement policy can also increase the vaccination rate to a certain extent, while the vaccination rate of self-paying people is only 1.8%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, the current vaccination system does not match actual needs. It is the best time to vaccinate against influenza before the epidemic season. my country’s annual vaccination work is concentrated between September and December. At present, influenza vaccination services mainly rely on vaccination clinics of the children&#39;s immunization program. Most vaccination sites only provide influenza vaccination for 1-2 half days on working days, which is not suitable for the annual concentrated vaccination demand. From the perspective of vaccination services, demand exceeds supply and it is difficult to make appointments for vaccination services, resulting in poor accessibility and convenience. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Others&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The 1918 influenza pandemic struck with almost unimaginable intensity and speed - infecting one-third of the Earth&#39;s population One (about 500 million people). Since then, all countries have been actively establishing public health systems to prevent influenza and exploring effective promotion measures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Getting people to take the initiative to get vaccinated is the top priority of public health actions in all countries. As of 2021, 65% of WHO member states (128 countries and regions) have included influenza vaccination for high-risk groups such as the elderly and medical staff in national immunization plans or public health projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Professor Feng Luzhao was a member of the WHO Advisory Committee on Immunization (SAGE) Influenza Vaccine Working Group and currently serves as an expert on the WHO New Influenza Vaccine Comprehensive Value Assessment Advisory Group. He studied influenza vaccination promotion strategies in many countries and found that many countries have rich experience in policy advocacy, improving vaccination accessibility, motivating vaccination service providers, and monitoring influenza vaccination behaviors and social drivers. The successful experience of the intervention measures effectively increased the influenza vaccination rate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Research found that many countries have included influenza vaccines in national immunization plans or introduced compulsory vaccination strategies. For example, in order to reduce the risk of infection among medical workers and patients, the health administration departments of the United States and Canada require medical workers and nursing home staff to receive influenza vaccines compulsorily. Secondly, we should vigorously increase the number and convenience of vaccination service points. In North America and European countries, influenza vaccination points have covered pharmacies, supermarkets, private clinics, hospitals and other places. Implementing incentive policies for service providers is also an effective means. The United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, etc. use the influenza vaccination rate of key groups as a performance evaluation indicator for medical personnel. The United Kingdom provides general practitioners with influenza-related educational materials and implements a performance incentive strategy to encourage medical staff to achieve the established influenza vaccination rate target and provide financial or material incentives to promote medical staff to vaccinate and recommend influenza vaccines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, some innovative incentives can also increase the willingness of medical staff to be vaccinated. In 2017, institutions such as Birmingham Children&#39;s Hospital in the UK implemented a vaccination campaign. When a medical staff completed the influenza vaccination, Medical institutions will donate 10 tetanus vaccines to children or mothers in developing countries through UNICEF. This measure has enabled the influenza vaccination rate of medical staff in these institutions to reach 95.7%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the procurement challenges caused by the uncertainty of demand for influenza vaccines and the diversity of strains, the &quot;Vaccine Delivery Research Innovation Laboratory&quot; once summarized the experience of developed countries and found that through quantity commitments during the procurement process, etc. The method of linking quantity and price is often conducive to lowering prices. For example, the UK allows manufacturers to give different quotations based on different purchase quantities during the bidding process (often the larger the purchase quantity, the lower the price), thereby effectively utilizing economies of scale and reducing manufacturer risks. The Canadian government will require each province or region to estimate its demand before awarding contracts to manufacturers, and requires each province or region to purchase at least 75% of its estimated amount, thus forming a quantity guarantee for manufacturers. At the same time, the government uses long-term contracts to reduce manufacturers&#39; risks, lower the price of vaccine procurement and increase the stability of vaccine supply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the public, extensive scientific and educational propaganda is also indispensable. The status of influenza vaccination in 15 European countries reminds that government departments&#39; monitoring of influenza vaccination rates and sending text message reminders for free vaccination are important factors in promoting vaccination among target groups. The United States, through media propaganda, not only increased the influenza vaccination rate among the elderly by 8%, but also advanced the vaccination time by 1.8-4.1 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These state-led measures have achieved remarkable results. Taking the elderly as an example, Brazil’s vaccination rate is as high as 89%; the UK’s vaccination rate for people over 65 years old has remained above 70% since 2004; the United States has maintained a vaccination rate of more than 70% for many years. Maintained above 60%; Canada, Spain, and New Zealand are about 60%-70%, and France, Australia, and Japan are about 50%-60%. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Strategic Recommendations&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Influenza vaccination can significantly reduce the risk of influenza and complications, and effectively reduce the number of outpatient and emergency visits, hospitalizations and deaths from influenza-related diseases. , the cost-effectiveness is very obvious. Since 2020, scientists have monitored and found that influenza and the new coronavirus are showing an alternating epidemic trend. Multiple studies have confirmed that co-infection with the new coronavirus and influenza virus will increase the risk of hospitalization and complicate the patient&#39;s condition. For years, scientists have emphasized the importance of influenza vaccination, but increasing vaccination rates remains difficult. In view of the low influenza vaccination rate in my country, Professor Feng Luzhao&#39;s team put forward the following strategic suggestions for policy makers to refer to:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Vaccine hesitancy has left many groups who should have received influenza vaccines in a &quot;streaking&quot; state. &quot;Health education should identify effective ways to target the public&#39;s misunderstandings about influenza and vaccines, especially for the elderly, primary and secondary school students and other groups covered by free programs, study the influencing factors of vaccination and effective intervention measures, and carry out precise publicity and science popularization .&quot; In the view of Professor Feng Luzhao, all localities should actively improve the public&#39;s understanding of influenza and enhance vaccine confidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For key groups, the study recommends gradually promoting free influenza vaccination for the elderly, primary and secondary school students, medical staff, etc., and striving to include influenza vaccination within the payment scope of basic medical insurance. They also encourage medical institutions at all levels to set up adult vaccination clinics, continuously strengthen the public health and prevention responsibilities of medical staff through continuing education, vocational training, etc., explore the right of medical staff to prescribe vaccines, and incorporate vaccination work into the evaluation system of medical institutions. Increase the enthusiasm of medical staff in recommending influenza vaccination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, in view of the high scrap rate of influenza vaccines every year, we can learn from international experience and sign long-term (such as not less than five years) contracts for influenza vaccines with enterprises, purchase in quantities, and ensure supply based on quantities. , not only can share market risks, but also ensure the stable growth of enterprise production capacity. Avoid the situation of annual production and large amounts of scrapping. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People don’t know when we will encounter another influenza pandemic, but it cannot be ruled out that it will happen again. As the WHO says: At the heart of an effective pandemic response is a strong, well-resourced health system. These include well-trained health workers; effective water, sanitation and hygiene systems; quality rapid diagnostic laboratory services; access to medical products, including vaccines; and reliable systems for tracking and reporting disease cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2023, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) updated the 2023-2024 influenza vaccine ingredient changes and vaccination recommendations, reminding the public that it is best to get vaccinated in September or October. In China, the 2023-2024 batch of influenza vaccines have arrived in various places and are open for reservation. According to the CDC surveillance data, the positive rate of influenza virus testing in some southern provinces has been rising slightly since the end of July. For individuals, facing the seasonal epidemic of influenza, proactive protection and vaccination to minimize the harm of the virus are practical choices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[店员控住偷窃女子：这不是执法权而是公民扭送权丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256574]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-13 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a netizen shot and uploaded a video:&amp;nbsp;On September 7, in Joy City, Xidan, Beijing, A woman was caught shoplifting in a cosmetics store. Two men (presumably both clerks) grabbed her arms and controlled her. The woman struggled hard and tried to escape and shouted &quot;Help&quot;. When a man called the police as if to call the police, the woman Once she broke away, the second man immediately hugged the woman&#39;s waist. At this time, an aunt who was watching stood up and asked, and the second man replied &quot;thief&quot;. The aunt yelled, &quot;Thieves are human beings too.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On social media platforms, many netizens believe that store clerks or security guards have the right to catch thieves, but aunts are not alone. There are also voices on the Internet that &quot;security guards or store clerks have no law enforcement power and have no right to restrict women&#39;s personal freedom.&quot; For example, some netizens said: &quot;Auntie is right. Although thieves are hateful, these two men are not law enforcement officers. There should be boundaries in their behavior. The behavior seen so far can easily cross the boundary and get themselves into trouble.&quot; This is a very representative point of view, so it deserves analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, it is correct that only law enforcement officers authorized by law have the power to enforce the law, but it does not mean that ordinary people have no right to defend their natural rights such as life, property and freedom. Going back to the above case, if these two men are the owners of the store, they are blameless in protecting their property; if they are not the owners, as employees (clerks or security guards) of the store and shopping mall, their duty is to protect the store. Or the goods in the shopping mall are protected from theft, which means that the owner of the goods authorizes them to protect the safety of the property. The cosmetics sold in such stores in shopping malls are generally expensive. If the store staff neglects to take precautions and protection, or just sit back and do nothing when they see someone stealing goods, then they will not only be derelict in their responsibility, but may also be required to bear the cost of the goods. loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people may say that if you see someone stealing cosmetics, just let them keep the cosmetics and then let them go. Why not forgive them? If you do this in a single incident, it seems that the store or shopping mall has no losses, but it undoubtedly creates an incentive: if you steal something from this store or shopping mall, as long as you are not caught, it is yours; if you are caught, it will only be yours. By leaving something behind, the individual can escape unscathed. The mathematical expectation of stealing is positive, which calls the thief to &quot;be stupid, have plenty of money, and come quickly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, store clerks, security guards or ordinary passers-by can control existing thieves, restrict their personal freedom, and either call the police and wait for the police to deal with them, or transfer them to the police. This is not the so-called &quot;law enforcement power&quot; , but the right of citizens to transfer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 84 of the current Criminal Procedure Law stipulates: Any citizen may immediately transfer a person to the public security organ, the People’s Procuratorate or the People’s Court for handling under the following circumstances: (1) While committing a crime or immediately after committing a crime Being discovered; (2) being wanted; (3) escaping from prison; (4) being hunted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, if the above-mentioned woman stole valuable cosmetics, she might fall into the first situation. Article 264 of the Criminal Law stipulates that whoever steals public or private property in a relatively large amount, or commits multiple thefts, burglaries, thefts with weapons, or pickpockets shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention, or surveillance, and shall also or solely be fined... …The &quot;Interpretation of Several Issues Concerning the Application of Laws in Handling Criminal Cases of Theft&quot; stipulates that theft of public and private property worth more than 1,000 yuan to 3,000 yuan shall be deemed as a &quot;large amount&quot; as stipulated in Article 264 of the Criminal Law, and also That is to say, the threshold for imprisonment is one thousand yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the case where the above-mentioned woman was caught stealing and suspected of a criminal offence, anyone can exercise the citizen&#39;s right to surrender. During the implementation process, the woman&#39;s personal freedom and freedom of movement will inevitably be restricted, which is also the proper meaning of the citizen&#39;s right to transfer. If a woman &quot;voluntarily&quot; goes to the public security organ or waits for the police to come to her door under the supervision and escort of everyone, the two clerks can certainly behave in a more polite manner, but no matter how &quot;gentle&quot; the clerk&#39;s behavior is, it is based on the fact that the woman&#39;s personal freedom has been temporarily suspended. based on restrictions. A woman is more &quot;gentle&quot; if she cooperates with the clerk, and less &quot;gentle&quot; if she doesn&#39;t cooperate with the clerk. In the final analysis, there is a certain reciprocal relationship between the actions of both parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, a store or shopping mall has the right to formulate and implement rules within its property scope, which is a manifestation of property rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, if the zoo requires visitors not to feed the animals, otherwise they may be asked out on the spot and blacklisted for refusing transactions. Shops or shopping malls require customers not to make loud noises or cause trouble and disrupt the peaceful shopping environment. Do not listen to the advice. You may be asked to leave. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These situations also inevitably involve restrictions on customers’ freedom of movement or forced eviction, but this is not a “law enforcement power” but a manifestation of “property rights” because businesses only restrict “their freedom of movement”. The freedom of movement of customers who break the rules &quot;within the property&quot;, that is, refusing such customers to continue to stay &quot;within the property&quot; is like saying to someone who is causing trouble in your home, &quot;Please leave, you are not welcome in my home.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, businesses that restrict the personal freedom of criminals currently in the store or hand them over to the police for processing, or expel unwelcome customers are not exercising the so-called &quot;law enforcement power.&quot; Law enforcement power often involves restricting personal freedom and freedom of movement. However, when restricting the personal freedom and freedom of movement of others, it may be law enforcement officers exercising &quot;law enforcement power&quot;, it may be good citizens exercising their legitimate private rights, or it may be criminals. To commit a crime, as this article demonstrates, we must understand the essential difference between exercising legitimate private rights and committing a crime, and we cannot equate stopping a crime with committing a crime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[4000万中央资金建3个民生项目，竟全烂尾]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256566]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-13 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;video id=&quot;contents-video-0&quot; data-fileid=&quot;5576678021071762841&quot; data-media=&quot; video&quot; data-resource=&quot;tencent&quot; data-filename=&quot;Focus Interview丨Why did three people&#39;s livelihood projects involving more than 40 million yuan of central funds all come to nothing?.mp4&quot; data-cover=&quot;&quot; data-url=&quot;http: //1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/93ffc8dfvodgzp1251434507/9d66c4e85576678021071762841/fz8j2DawytoA.mp4&quot; poster=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot;>; &lt;source src=&quot;http://12514345 07.vod2 .myqcloud.com/93ffc8dfvodgzp1251434507/9d66c4e85576678021071762841/fz8j2DawytoA.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;>;&lt;/video>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, in order to promote the development of local economic and social undertakings, the central finance department will Certain investment fund subsidies will be provided to qualified local government investment projects and enterprise investment projects, covering areas such as affordable housing construction, pollution control, energy conservation and carbon reduction.

However, residents reported that the three-dimensional garage was indeed built, but it was not used at all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/80800df64ecbf4c08126c36f5543cf27.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/80800df64ecbf4c08126c36f5543cf27.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250497&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;When I walked into this garage, it was full of dust and flying catkins, and there were no signs of a car parked on the ground. Some places have been damaged, and the circuits have not even been officially connected, and some corners have even become places where garbage is piled. The three-dimensional garage is a mechanical equipment system that can store and store a large number of vehicles, which can solve the problem of insufficient parking spaces on the ground. The built three-dimensional garage is idle and abandoned. What is the reason behind this? The reporter found the property owner of the community to learn about the situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liang Caiyun, manager of the Hepingli Community Property Company in Changyuan City, Henan Province:&lt;/strong>;“So far, the technical management rights have not been transferred to us.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/a5653e7091b5089187f435a828f6dc81.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height= &quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/a5653e7091b5089187f435a828f6dc81.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250501&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This three-dimensional garage Who actually built it? After it is completed, why not hand it over to the property for use? The property manager said that these garages were applied for construction by the developers of the converted shed community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/495785deec4c3387618896218e02e6b3.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/495785deec4c3387618896218e02e6b3.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250496&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Changyuan&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Aoqi&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Head of Real Estate Development Company&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Fu Caiting&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;:&lt; /strong>;“Because there are not enough ground parking spaces, since there are government support policies, I applied for three-dimensional parking spaces.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The government support policy the person in charge mentioned is the central government’s special funds. The application materials at that time showed that in 2016, this community, which is the three-dimensional garage project of the food company&#39;s shantytown reconstruction and resettlement housing, and the property and sanitary housing were included in the central budget investment of Henan Province&#39;s affordable housing infrastructure, with an estimated investment of 5.42 million. Yuan. Why do good things come to an end? We found the construction company of the three-dimensional garage to learn about the situation. The person in charge of this company said that most of these three-dimensional garages are not easy to use in actual use. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/e72fa1c5560d65de11ba00bb418e132c.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/e72fa1c5560d65de11ba00bb418e132c.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250489&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhongyuan&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Aoqi&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Fu Sen, the person in charge of Industrial Co., Ltd.:&lt;/strong>;“It is special equipment and needs to be inspected every two years. Like an elevator, you need to sign up for a professional maintenance team every year. A parking space costs more than 100 yuan. If you keep investing in it, the owner will not spend money to buy this thing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It seems that when this type of product is actually used, Parking is difficult, has many restrictions, and incurs relatively high operating expenses. Market acceptance is very low, and garage manufacturers are obviously well aware of this. Is this situation clear to the city&#39;s Shanty Town Renovation Office, which is responsible for implementing this project? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/20359fe454dfac9ffdfcf811afdaed52.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/20359fe454dfac9ffdfcf811afdaed52.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250491&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;With the funds, three six-story three-dimensional garages with a capacity of 123 parking spaces were quickly built. The person in charge of the company undertaking the construction of the garage said that it is most appropriate to use special government funds to build a three-dimensional garage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/47aa3363e5e4ee66f308c75fec70618a.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/47aa3363e5e4ee66f308c75fec70618a.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250488&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Dong Peng, Director of the Shantytown Reconstruction Office of Changyuan City, Henan Province:&lt;/strong>; “If the garage is implemented, it will be beneficial to the people, the government, and individuals. The result will be beneficial to the people. They did not do it well, but they themselves benefited.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no doubt that Aoqi Industrial, the company that built the garage, became the biggest beneficiary of this project. According to the winning bid documents at the time, they won the bid at a price of 4.61 million yuan to build 123 parking spaces, with an average price of nearly 40,000 yuan per parking space. The reporter learned during the interview with Aoqi Industrial that even now, the market price they offer is only about 20,000 yuan per parking space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/a67f6eb37c23d88650bbcbd43ed3fb8c.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/a67f6eb37c23d88650bbcbd43ed3fb8c.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250492&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;The market price is about 20,000 yuan. When the project in this community was implemented, the company won the bid at a price of nearly 40,000 yuan. The profit margin is really not small. Even so, why is the garage still not put into use normally? The reporter&#39;s investigation revealed that the reason behind this is not unrelated to the poor project management of the relevant departments. According to the bidding plan issued by the Changyuan City Shantytown Renovation Office at the time, the bidding content not only included the construction of the three-dimensional garage, but also clearly included &quot;the training, trial operation and delivery of installation and commissioning personnel.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms-emer-res.cctvnews.cctv.com/image/3003/upload/15a347e52fa44d4aabaac9abe3a47192.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 0.5; &quot; width=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cms-emer-res.cctvnews.cctv.com/image/3003/upload/15a347e52fa44d4aabaac9abe3a47192.png&quot; data-key=&quot;media-1694567076243 -8&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only have they not been put into use, in fact, these three garages have not even been completed at the most basic level. The construction of these three garages with a total of 123 parking spaces was completed at the end of 2017. However, in June 2018, the garage builder received a demolition decision from the local planning bureau, requiring them to demolish one of them within 15 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Deputy Director of the Natural Resources and Planning Bureau of Changyuan City, Henan Province&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Mao Yongxia&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;:&lt;/strong>; “Residents also reported it, saying that it affected the lighting , so he issued a demolition penalty decision, but the 15 days were not up, so he demolished it on his own.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the garage was demolished, the company did not find a place to rebuild it, but piled a pile of waste materials in the community. . However, this does not affect the relevant departments from allocating the remaining nearly one million yuan of project funds to the company in 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/9c6f911d1293bab50ccd767bf8547d2d.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/9c6f911d1293bab50ccd767bf8547d2d.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250490&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;The number of parking spaces is insufficient and has not been delivered for use, but the company has received all 4.66 million yuan in financial funds. In this way, no one will take care of the later trial operation, delivery operation and other issues. The problem of difficult parking in the community has not yet been solved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first project on the schedule ended up running out of funds and the garage became a decoration. What about the next project on the schedule? Let’s take a look at the Puguang community resettlement housing supporting project. The local government submitted an application to build a kindergarten, a clinic and other related facilities, and the central government allocated a total of more than 18 million yuan. However, the reporter walked around the community twice and found no newly built kindergarten. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/b46d588ea3a34e7f7dda17777fc3f608.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/b46d588ea3a34e7f7dda17777fc3f608.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250494&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Song Guangjun, deputy general manager of Henan Great Wall Construction Company:&lt;/strong>; &quot;Originally, I applied for a location in the south district of the community, but that location in the south district was unrealistic.

After the two areas are planned, we can&#39;t say that a building will pop up.

There is a row of commercial front rooms at the entrance of Puguang Community. The developer said that two of the front rooms are health rooms. According to the winning bid documents for the supporting projects in Puguang Community at that time, Great Wall Construction Company won the bid for this project in December 2016, and the completion date of the building where the clinic is located was also December 2016, which means that this project is recruiting When the bidding process was held, the entire building was already completed, so how could there be any talk of a new health room? &lt;p>; &quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/1f9dc021ec5ddc8fa6813f3e582b68ed.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/1f9dc021ec5ddc8fa6813f3e582b68ed.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250500&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is said to take practical use into consideration , In fact, this so-called health room has not been put into use yet.

The central government has allocated a total of 17 million yuan in funds, and it is scheduled to be completed in 2017.

At the construction company of this road, the reporter learned that they actually only received more than 6 million yuan in funding. In accordance with the requirements of relevant documents, local development and reform departments and housing construction departments should take measures to strengthen dynamic supervision of project construction implementation, and projects that cannot be completed on time or fail to pass completion acceptance will be criticized through notices, withdrawn or deducted from the central budget Domestic investment and other measures shall be punished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the reporter&#39;s interview, the local government rectified these problematic projects, and now garages, health rooms, etc. are gradually being put into use. Central fiscal funds are invested in local people&#39;s livelihood projects. In order for central fiscal funds to be used wisely and truly promote development, benefit the people, and benefit the country, it is necessary to strengthen effective supervision of fund implementation and project implementation.

Starting from July 20, audit reports from various regions will be released one after another. As of September 10, only Xinjiang, Tibet, and Guizhou have not yet released. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The level of detail in audit reports varies from place to place. The audit reports of Henan, Inner Mongolia, and Sichuan have detailed data. When talking about the problems that occurred, Fujian&#39;s audit report only mentioned irregularities and did not specify the specific amounts. The same is true for the Shaanxi audit report. Most of the issues do not state the amount involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Guangxi published the audit report on the government website, it removed the original text. &quot;A university has received a cumulative financial investment of 131 million yuan in scientific research funds, implemented 862 scientific research projects, and achieved 0 results transformation.&quot; In early August, the above content in the Guangxi audit report became a hot search on Weibo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters carefully read 28 audit reports and reported on the outstanding issues in the audit reports of Hebei, Henan, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Chongqing and Shanghai (see Southern Weekend App&#39;s &quot;Interpretation of Provincial and Municipal Audit Reports&quot; special topic). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The financial problems presented in the audit reports of 28 regions also have common characteristics, including misappropriation of funds, large scale of temporary fiscal payments, idle special debts, illegal lending by city commercial banks and rural credit cooperatives, etc. How to find a solution is the key to the &quot;second half of the article&quot; in audit rectification. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;22&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Lands involved in misappropriation of funds&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Among the 28 provinces that released audit reports, the same problem occurred in 22 places The problem - misappropriation of funds, including transfer payment funds, special debt funds, employment subsidies, project funds, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Two cities and four counties misappropriated 4.491 billion yuan of government special bond funds for 23 projects, which were used for real estate commercial development projects, other debt repayments, and other expenses.” Guangxi audit report wrote. Looking at the audit reports that have been published in various places, 4.491 billion is the highest misappropriation amount. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The misappropriation of funds includes the misappropriation of compulsory education funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relevant agencies in Inner Mongolia audited 469 urban schools and 184 rural schools and found that 21 banner counties misappropriated 265 million yuan of compulsory education funds to make up for the funding gap in other projects; 42 banner counties 991 million yuan Funds for compulsory education are stagnant, resulting in projects such as improving school conditions being unable to be implemented or completed on schedule. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Insufficient funds will cause other problems. &quot;41 banner counties have borrowed 923 teachers on a long-term basis, and 74 primary and secondary schools in 16 banner counties have insufficient staff, and long-term temporary employment of substitute teachers.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chongqing, which is more than a thousand kilometers away from Inner Mongolia, is facing Faced with the same problem, &quot;177 schools in 8 districts and counties illegally used 33.0776 million yuan per student in public funds, training funds, etc. for daily operations and other expenses.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The State Council’s audit report also disclosed the misappropriation of education funds: After an audit of urban and rural compulsory education subsidy funds, it was found that 16 provinces had misappropriated 2.524 billion yuan to balance budgets, repay debts, and issue benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the audit reports of various provinces, the main flow of misappropriated funds is daily expenses or filling a certain funding gap. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“19 units occupied 9.7214 million yuan in employment subsidy funds to make up for the lack of unit administrative funds and office building maintenance and other expenses.” The Hubei audit report stated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many places also use false expenditures to obtain funds. The audit reports of 8 provinces mentioned &quot;false expenditures&quot;, with the largest amount involved being in Sichuan, with 4.832 billion yuan of fictitious expenditures in 4 cities and counties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Two departments and three affiliated units falsely listed electricity expenses of 1.6293 million yuan.&quot; Heilongjiang audit report introduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The audit report of the State Council mentioned that 2 departments and 8 affiliated units obtained 80.7967 million yuan of funds through fictitious expenditures and other methods, of which 4.7185 million yuan was used for food, drink, gifts, etc., or was misappropriated by individuals. . This reflects on one side that behind the false expenditures, there may be corruption issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Budget Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; promulgated in 2019 stipulates that governments at all levels and relevant departments and units are ordered to fail to include all government revenues and expenditures in the budget, or to falsely list revenues and expenditures. To make corrections, the directly responsible person in charge and other directly responsible personnel will be punished by demotion, dismissal, or expulsion in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Hundreds of billions of temporary payments to be solved&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Among the problems found in the provincial audit reports, most of the problems involving the highest amounts are financial temporary payments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found that the issue of temporary payments was mentioned in the audit reports of six provinces including Inner Mongolia and Hebei. Among them, the temporary payment balance in 5 provinces exceeds 10 billion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Financial temporary payments are generally funds temporarily lent by the financial department to budget units. It is required that they should not be left on the books for a long time and should be cleared and settled in a timely manner. The Ministry of Finance stipulates that all localities must digest the fiscal temporary payments formed in 2018 and before by the end of 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The State Council audit report shows that as of the end of 2022, the balance of temporary fiscal payments in 54 regions reached 148.139 billion yuan, an increase of 8.363 billion yuan over the previous year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Inner Mongolia audit report stated, “The balance of temporary payments in 4 cities reached 47.055 billion yuan at the end of 2021, and the progress of digesting the stock is slow. 2 cities at the same level and 8 banner counties (districts) have not completed the digestion progress. Task&quot;. Among the six provinces that have announced temporary payment issues, Inner Mongolia has the highest temporary payment balance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Ministry of Finance stipulates that the newly formed fiscal temporary payment balance after 2019 shall not exceed 5% of the sum of general public budget expenditures and government fund budget expenditures at the same level. Audit reports from Guangxi, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, and Hebei all revealed that some counties and cities failed to meet this requirement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Guangxi audit report shows that as of the end of 2022, the cumulative balance of fiscal temporary payments newly formed after 2019 has exceeded the 5% control line in 10 cities and 54 counties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, the provisional payments in Hubei and Guangxi have not decreased but increased. &quot;As of the end of 2022, the balance of temporary payments in 20 cities and counties reached 26.055 billion yuan, an increase of 1.386 billion yuan over the previous year.&quot; The Hubei audit report revealed that some were used for unbudgeted and over-budget expenditures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2018, the Ministry of Finance issued the &quot;Notice on Strictly Regulating the Management of Temporary Payments of Local Finances&quot;, requiring the financial department not to lend to enterprises, nor to lend to enterprises through other budget units. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, illegal lending to enterprises still exists today. The Inner Mongolia audit report stated that “one city level and three banner districts illegally lent 4.585 billion yuan to enterprises.” The Hebei audit report also showed that four cities illegally lent 1.068 billion yuan to enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Excessive temporary payment balances will crowd out other funds for special purposes and normal treasury funds, creating a situation where &quot;the budget has targets, but the treasury has no cash.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The gap between local revenue and expenditure is widening, and it is difficult to get back the money borrowed.” A financial bureau official in a coastal province told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年7月公布的《2022年广西壮族自治区本级决算报告》中写到，要建立暂付款分类管理机制，稳妥消化存量，严格控制增量，推动基层暂付款保持合理规模，逐步回补被挤占的库款，保障预算内支出需要。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;数百亿专项债闲置&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;作为政府拉动消费、扩大内需的一项重要手段，专项债成为各地审计报告关注的重点内容。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;28份省级审计报告中，有19份提到了专项债存在的问题。其中，12份报告都表示存在专项债闲置的情况。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;地方政府专项债券，又称“专项债”，指省级政府为有一定收益的公益性项目发行的债券。长期以来，主要投向社会基础性投资领域。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果是一般债，主要投向无收益的公益性项目，还本付息来源是一般公共预算收入。相较之下，专项债的还款资金是政府性基金收入、专项收入及再融资专项债券资金，要求实现项目收支平衡。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;部分地区审计报告透露，有些专项债资金闲置的时间长达一年。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;江苏审计报告称，审计机构抽查62个市县发现，截至2022年末，54个市县有337个项目的政府专项债券资金未全部投入使用，结存金额229.44亿元。其中，91.23亿元结存1年以上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“省本级债券资金19.54亿元，滞留闲置最长达247天；南阳等29个市县债券资金66.37亿元，滞留闲置最长达300天。”河南审计报告透露。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;专项债闲置后，除了原本的投资目标无法实现，地方政府还需为这笔资金支付利息。专项债在账上多“躺”一天，就多出许多成本。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据财政部数据，专项债平均利率略高于一般债。截至2023年7月末，地方政府债券平均利率3.33%。其中，一般债券3.31%，专项债券3.34%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以江苏审计报告为例，结存1年以上的专项债资金为91.23亿元。按专项债平均利率3.34%计算，一年大约要付3.05亿元利息。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;什么原因导致了数百亿专项债闲置？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;综合各地审计报告，主要是前期准备阶段出现问题。例如，吉林在审计报告中坦言，因未能取得建设用地手续等原因，项目准备不充分，难以按时开工，7市县22个项目资金闲置59.93亿元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;江苏审计报告介绍专项债闲置是因为“建设项目开工条件不成熟、实施进度滞后或债券资金安排超前等原因”。 &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中央财经大学教授温来成告诉南方周末记者，按照正常流程，项目完成所有的政府审批手续后，再上报省一级财政部门申请发行专项债，资金到位便立即开工。然而，一些地方政府走审批流程时就开始申报专项债，财政部门有时候也会同意发行。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他解释，专项债属于政府投资项目，参与审批的政府部门多达二十多个。如果有一个部门不同意，项目就不能开工建设。即使专项债资金到位，也没办法使用，容易造成闲置。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;城商行&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;、&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;农信社违规放贷&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;除了紧盯财政领域的问题，审计报告也关注金融系统存在的乱象。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;8份省级审计报告提及，多家城商行、农信社在风险管控、合规经营等板块存在漏洞。其中，涉及金额最大的部分是违规放贷。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;过去几年间，主管部门正收紧区域性商业银行异地放贷的空间。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2020年公布的《中华人民共和国商业银行法（修改建议稿）》要求，城市商业银行、农村商业银行、村镇银行等区域性商业银行，应当在住所地范围内依法开展经营活动，未经批准，不得跨区域展业。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;河北审计部门发现，8家城商行违规发放贷款，包括向贷款已经逾期的客户或关系人发放贷款，以及一个辖区内的不同分支机构，给同一借款人发放贷款，违规放贷涉及金额406亿元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;9家城商行不能严格履行“贷款三查”制度，导致59.59亿元贷款资金存在较大风险。 “贷款三查”指的是贷前调查、贷时审查、贷后检查。这一制度能使银行了解借款人的经营状况，判断贷款风险，也是事后追责的重要依据。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;江西审计报告披露，32家农商银行“贷款三查”不严，违规向征信等不符合条件的借款人发放贷款25.02亿元。 29家农商银行未对贷款资金用途进行有效跟踪检查，47.9亿元信贷资金被挪用。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了违规放贷，多家城商行的风险管控还存在问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;江西审计报告介绍，28家农商行通过违规调整贷款分类结果、以贷还贷等方式掩盖贷款风险，少反映不良贷款25.52亿元；8家农商行违规扩大授信，通过向第三方发放贷款承接债务、贷款平移等方式，处置不良资产18.54亿元；23家农商行违规核销不良贷款16.26亿元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;辽宁审计部门重点调查了2家城市商业银行经营情况，发现“1家银行行长和副行长岗位长期缺位，部分高级管理人员任职未经监管部门核准”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;内蒙古审计报告透露了一个细节，某县卫健委、公安局等政府部门领导干部6人及其他12名公职人员违规入股2家农村商业银行，涉及320.36万元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;做好审计整改“下半篇文章”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;二十届中央审计委员会第一次会议强调，审计整改“下半篇文章”与审计揭示问题“上半篇文章”同样重要，必须一体推进。要把督促审计整改作为日常监督的重要抓手，将审计结果作为干部考核、任免、奖惩的重要参考。对整改不力、敷衍整改、虚假整改的，要严肃问责。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年12月，贵州省审计厅官网发布《关于2021年度省级预算执行和其他财政收支审计查出问题整改情况的报告》。报告介绍，针对1个市和10个县挤占挪用生态环保资金17.64亿元的问题，相关地区对挤占挪用的资源环境类资金进行清理，已通过原渠道归还等整改4.75亿元，剩余资金计划逐步归还到位。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年度18个省份的审计报告中，有专门章节介绍违纪违法线索移送情况，或者审计查出问题初步整改情况。根据各地审计厅（局）官网，审计报告出台后一年左右，会专门发布一份报告，关注审计报告中查出问题的整改情况。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;海南审计报告中介绍，2022年，省审计厅共移送违纪违法问题线索28宗，涉及82人、4.40亿元。截至2023年6月，已办结7宗，正在办理21宗，12人受到处理处分。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;移送事项表现为公职人员违规决策、以权谋私等，造成国有资金、国有资产和国有资源损失浪费，涉及11宗72人1.25亿元。此外，工程建设领域“相互串通”“内外勾结”问题隐蔽多样，主要是项目违规招投标、违规分包转包、围标串标，涉及5宗3人2.78亿元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;财政收支矛盾加大，挪用的资金如何补上，成为审计整改过程中的难题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位在南方某省审计厅任职的官员向南方周末记者介绍，地方政府挪用资金被审计部门发现后，因为整改要求，需要把资金悉数补回，但因为财力紧张，部分地方又出现了挪用其他资金来归还挪用款项的情况。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“过去5年来，全国共审计44万多个单位，向纪检监察、司法等部门移送重大问题线索3.8万多件，涉及9200多亿元、5.1万多人；促进增收节支和挽回损失2万多亿元。”在2023年1月的全国审计工作会议上，审计署审计长侯凯介绍。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;6月28日，对国务院审计报告的汇报中，侯凯说，截至2023年4月，对2021年度审计发现的问题，已整改问题金额8501.11亿元，完善制度2900多项，追责问责1.4万多人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他表示，重点督办的问题线索总体进展顺利，铲除了一些阻碍改革发展和长期未解决的顽瘴痼疾。 “审计整改总体格局初步成型，审计工作&#39;下半篇文章&#39;更加权威高效。”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;肇庆市高要二中小卖部，现由道诚百货经营，平均年租金十余万。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（南方周末记者卫琳聪/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年9月9日，广西贺州市平桂区人民政府办公室发布一则通报，将对贺州第五高级中学小卖部经营权进行调查。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此前，该校以224万元的价格，将校园小卖部2023年秋季学期至2024年春季学期的经营权承包给当地一家食品批发店，而这家店成立仅一个月，引发舆论关注。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是半个月来因校园小卖部拍出高价第二次引发热议。8月22日，广东肇庆市怀集中学小卖部5年租金拍出943万余元，约合189万元/年。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“天价”小卖部也并非最近才有。早在2016年，广西南宁三中小卖部就因租金高达173万元/年被各大媒体报道。近两年，湖南邵阳等地也接连爆出年租金上百万的校园小卖部。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者调查发现，正是由于校园小卖部招标方式越来越公开透明，才令这门被人忽视的“大生意”受到前所未有的关注，而校内小卖部的稀缺性，是其拍出高价的根源。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“9&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;00&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;万元的大生意”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2023年9月1日，怀集中学刚刚开学，一排排新生正在操场上列队军训。这所2011年成立的公办学校有8300多名学生，涵盖初中和高中。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;学校对面遍布各类餐饮店和便利店，麻辣烫、螺蛳粉、奶茶、流动小吃摊等花花绿绿的招牌挂满了一条街。中午放学时间，校门打开，穿蓝白校服的学生蜂拥而出，整条街瞬间热闹起来。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管刚开学，但学校小卖部租金拍出高价的消息已经在学生和商户间传开。这家150平方米的小卖部开在校园内，现在是学生口中“900万元的大生意”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;周边商户告诉南方周末记者，怀集中学对面近百平方米的店铺，每月租金在2000元左右。校内小卖部租金折合月算，比校外这些店铺高出六倍多。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但对于校内这个租金水平，商户们并不感到惊讶。他们介绍，怀集中学实行半封闭式管理，不少学生住校，只有中午和下午几个小时外出时间，多数时候在校内消费，而校内只有一家小卖部。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“一个军训下来，一天不说多，光饮料就能卖五六百箱。”一位在校门口开奶茶店的老板说，他的小孩就在怀集中学读书，小卖部卖的商品价格要比校外贵5毛到1块。多位学生也向南方周末记者证实了这一点。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张雪瑞和丈夫在肇庆经营一家食品行，给肇庆多所学校小卖部供货，已经做了十几年。她告诉南方周末记者，校外小卖部的毛利率一般为25%-30%，而校内小卖部可以达到40%，消费主力是住校生。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她详细算了一笔账：怀集中学小卖部租金一年近两百万元，扣除人工、水电费等成本，小卖部每天营收3万左右才能保本。学校共有8300多名学生，如果有4000人住校，每人每天消费10元，单日营业额能达到4万元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这家小卖部位于怀集中学西门附近。9月1日开学这天，小卖部正忙着进货，成堆的货物从门口停放的货车里卸下。店里已经摆好了9个货架和两排冰柜，除了零食、饮料，还卖文具和生活用品。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;怀集中学小卖部的中标公告，并未显示中标人信息。但小卖部的价格标签上都写着“都市通便利店”。都市通便利店隶属于深圳市都市通实业有限公司（下称都市通）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;企查查显示，都市通曾中标深‬圳‬市‬第‬三‬高‬级‬中‬学、布‬吉‬高‬级‬中‬学、深‬圳‬市‬龙‬岗‬区‬第‬二‬职‬业‬技‬术‬学‬校等多所学校的采购项目，为其供应方便面、饮料等食品和文具、生活用品。‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;怀集中学小卖部的招标公告和怀集县对此事的说明，均透露了当时竞争之激烈：34个人（含公司）进行了2274轮竞价，按照1000元的加价幅度，38万余元的挂牌价最后被抬高到超过943万，加价近24倍。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年5月10日，肇庆市高要区第二中学小卖部3年经营权以728万元成交，一年租金约243万元，比怀集中学小卖部还高。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;广东广播电视台的报道显示，该项目经过167次增价竞拍，最终由广东省成隆校园便利店连锁管理有限公司竞得，负责人姓许。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;许姓负责人在接受采访时表示，投标的时候没底，也不知道最终会去到那么高的价格。为了和对手竞争，他以3万元的加价幅度逐步抬高价格，“想着对方都能做，我们也能做，（最终成交价）只比对手多了3万元”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;凡是以竞价方式招租的小卖部，战况都很激烈。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据《上游新闻》报道，2021年4月，湖南邵阳新宁县第二中学100平方米小卖部3年租金起拍价68万元，最终以320万元成交，约合107万元/年。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在一则背景为“新宁县第二中学小卖部门面经营权公开拍卖会”的视频中，竞拍者不断举牌加价，拍卖价格一路攀升。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《法制晚报》报道，2016年广西南宁市第三中学172平方米小卖部年租金拍出173万元。一位参与竞拍的人士介绍，共8位竞价人参与竞争，使用电子竞拍器出价，以50万元底起拍，加价1次最低1万元，最终经过44轮竞价方才成交。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，有些小卖部的高租金并不是一次性缴纳，大大降低了中标者的资金压力，也让投标者在竞标时可以大胆加价。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如怀集中学小卖部承包合同中明确，租金按月计缴。5年930多万元的租金，每月缴纳约15.5万元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;店内一位工作人员亦向南方周末记者表示，第一个月租金交了就可以开业。“十几二十万而已，你有钱也可以做这个生意。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;公开竞&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;价&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;实际上，近年来“天价”小卖部频频见诸报端，也和招投标流程逐步规范、公开有关。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;公立学校小卖部属于国有资产，租金收入应纳入政府非税收入管理。早在2004年，财政部就曾发布加强政府非税收入管理的通知，提出“要依法推行国有资源使用权招标、拍卖”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此后各地开始逐步推进。高要区财政局一位工作人员向南方周末记者回忆，区里逐步规范小卖部招租是从2009年开始。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“2009年之后，校园小卖部招租要由财政局审批后进行招拍挂。此前只需学校向教育局报批，招拍挂流程也没有现在规范。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2016年南宁三中校办主任在接受《法制晚报》记者采访时表示，当时南宁市对校园进行规范化试点，将原本捆绑在一起的小卖部和食堂进行剥离，开始对小卖部公开招租。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在全国公共资源交易平台上，能检索到的校园小卖部招标公告大多出现在2020年之后。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;肇庆第一条公告出现在2021年，招标人是高要二中。上述高要区财政局工作人员介绍，校园小卖部招标工作归属资产管理股负责，这个部门正是当时成立的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不经过公开竞价的小卖部，有时则存在一些问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如福建厦门第十中学官网显示，2014年8月31日至2017年7月31日，学校食堂和小卖部实行捆绑承包经营，由学校组织相关人员组成评标小组进行综合评标，择优中标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;公告中特别说明，教职工配偶可参与投标，以帮助其就业。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而小卖部承包中不透明招租、教职工亲属参与等方式，曾屡屡引发校园腐败。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年广西横州市纪委监委网站披露的一则案例显示，横州市石塘镇一所小学的校长在2006年至2014年间，将学校小卖部以每年8000元的价格承包给其妻子经营，2014年后租金上调至1万元/年，由其妻子继续租到2020年，租金远低于同类小学小卖部。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2006年至2020年，该小学小卖部均未向社会公开招标，也没有报经主管部门审核同意、报财政部门审批。涉事校长被查后受到留党察看二年、降低岗位等级处分。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;新的矛盾&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;然而，公开竞价在增强招标透明性的同时，也产生了新的问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;外界的担忧在于，中标商家可能会通过提高商品售价，将租金成本转嫁到学生身上。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年小卖部拍出3年320万租金后，邵阳新宁二中一直面对这样的质疑。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位曾负责此次招标的新宁县政府工作人员向南方周末记者透露，以往新宁县也采用公开竞标方式拍卖校园小卖部经营权，年租金大多二三十万元。2021年因为商家互相竞争，价格被炒得比较高，落选商家将此事爆料给媒体，进而引发了关注。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随后新宁县叫停了此次招标，并对招标情况展开调查。调查结果并没有发现招标过程有违规之处，但政府担心商家在高租金压力下抬高商品价格，难以监管，最终决定关闭县里所有公立学校的校园小卖部。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我们县主要是不能解决这个矛盾。如果以招拍挂把小卖部承包出去，（商家）利润和学生消费（权益）存在矛盾。如果不承包出去，学校不是商业机构，不能作为法人自己经营。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同样因“天价”小卖部引发舆论关注的南宁三中，作出了同样的选择。一位总务处的工作人员告诉南方周末记者，学校已经好几年没有开设小卖部了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以728万拍得高要二中小卖部3年经营权后，承包商在实际经营过程中出现问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据广东电视台《今日一线》栏目报道，该承包商经营不到半年就关门歇业。校方负责人接受采访时称，承包商2021年9月份向学校及教育局提出关门请求，表示经营亏损，无法持续。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;高要二中在小卖部租赁合同中明确要求，“小卖部经营的所有商品必须明码标价，商品价格不得高于市场价格”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张雪瑞曾给该承包商供货，她告诉南方周末记者，截至关门歇业，对方还欠她16万元货款未付。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张雪瑞展示了2021年丈夫对该承包商的微信催款记录，对方表示：“二中做三个多月，保证金24万亏掉，租金连装修，要亏掉六七十万，这六七十万欠供应商一大半，现在需结算完毕，股东们拿钱来付亏损，所以要点时间。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;实际上，对于在校内开设小卖部，有关部门一直有所管控。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2019年12月，教育部、市场监管总局等四部门联合印发《关于落实主体责任强化校园食品安全管理的指导意见》，要求非寄宿制中小学、幼儿园原则上不得在校内设置食品小卖部、超市，已经设置的，要逐步退出。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;高要区教育局一位工作人员向南方周末记者介绍，他们曾反复研讨过这份指导意见，认为意见并没有要求学校完全不能开设小卖部。目前高要区只在寄宿学校中开设小卖部，以满足学生需求。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对政府而言，小卖部租金也是一笔财政收入。上述多地政府部门的工作人员均向南方周末记者表示，按照财政部对非税收入的管理规定，公立学校小卖部作为国有资产，其租金收入目前都统一上缴国库，按收支两条线进行管理。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;综合评分&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;高要区没有对小卖部一关了之，为了解决部分寄宿学校实际需求与“天价”租金之间的矛盾，对招标方式进行了改革。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上述高要区教育局工作人员表示，全区总共有七八十家公办学校，目前25家仍设有校内小卖部。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年3月，高要区将18家租约到期的校内小卖部进行打包，统一招租。评标方式也从“价高者得”变为“综合评分”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;全国公共资源交易平台发布的公告显示，这一整体招租项目5年租金挂牌价1062万元，最终以1221万元成交。平均一家小卖部年租金仅13.6万元，比高要二中之前的价格低两百多万元。中标人为佛山市活道投资有限公司（下称活道投资）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者探访了其中一家校内小卖部，发现其挂上了广东省道诚百货有限公司（下称道诚百货）的营业执照。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年6月以来，道诚百货先后注册成立18家公司，地址分布在高要区打包招标小卖部的18家公立学校内。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;活道投资与道诚百货是什么关系？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上述高要区教育局工作人员表示，“道诚”是活道投资的品牌。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;企查查显示，活道投资法定代表人为戴朝国，他也曾是道诚百货的法定代表人。2023年3月1日，道诚百货法定代表人变更为李瑞强，他是道诚百货唯一股东。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年6月，道诚百货与国企肇庆市高要高庆农业科技发展有限公司等，共同投资成立了一家公司，李瑞强任监事。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为什么将18家学校小卖部打包出租，并且租金比之前低？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上述高要区教育局工作人员解释，打包招租是为了方便管理，并规避“天价”租金。招标时也会选择有实力的公司，避免出现后续无力经营的情况。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;具体的评标办法政府方面并未披露，相关公告显示，招标采用综合评分法确定中标人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年9月，肇庆宣卿中学的小卖部招租同样采用综合评分法，学校同时发布了一份评标报告：评标根据技术与商务评审得分、价格评审得分计算综合得分，综合得分高者中标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;宣卿中学三位中标候选人中，租金报价最高的公司，综合得分最低。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（应受访者要求，张雪瑞为化名）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国际观察｜“美国的手上沾满智利人的鲜血”——起底美国阴谋颠覆阿连德政府始末]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256568]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-13 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;“我将以生命捍卫祖国的宝贵原则。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1973年9月11日，智利首都圣地亚哥，在被政变军人包围的总统府，来自左翼阵营的智利总统萨尔瓦多·阿连德发表广播讲话，表达战斗到底的决心。当天晚些时候，总统府被攻占，阿连德殉职。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“这场政变翻开了智利历史上最黑暗的章节之一。”古巴拉丁美洲通讯社一篇报道这样评价。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;今年9月11日是阿连德政府遭政变推翻50周年纪念日。半个世纪以来，许多历史研究和解密档案显示，美国在阻止阿连德上台和颠覆阿连德政府的过程中费尽心机、不择手段。今年也是美国提出“门罗主义”200年。长期以来，美国抱持霸权主义，操弄“民主自由”话术，利用政变干涉、经济制裁等手段，给拉美国家和人民造成深重苦难。如今，越来越多的拉美国家和人民正在觉醒，反对美国霸权干涉的呼声日益高涨。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;“很明显，要想阻止阿连德政府行使权力，任何形式的政治或宪法途径都不可能成功，唯一有可能成功的机会是在阿连德掌权之前或之后立即发动军事政变……希望情报站尽可能多地与有影响力的军方人物建立直接联系。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1970年9月9日，美国中央情报局将一封秘密电报发给其在智利的情报站。此前，智利总统选举投票刚结束，左翼政党联盟人民团结阵线候选人阿连德得票第一，这令美国政府十分恼火。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美国政府对阿连德的打压可以追溯到1964年。这一年，在上届智利总统选举中落败的阿连德再次参选。彼时，美苏冷战正酣，视拉美为自家“后院”的美国政府不愿看到这名左翼领导人当选智利总统。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;于是，美国秘密扶植阿连德的竞选对手，向阿连德对手的党派提供数百万美元竞选经费，并通过中情局资助智利右翼团体和媒体，发布大量攻击抹黑阿连德的信息，鼓动民众不要给他投票。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美国的干涉行动得偿所愿，阿连德在1964年的总统选举中落败。这些幕后操纵明显违背了美国一贯宣扬的“民主”说辞，但美国政客给出的荒谬理由是：美国干涉对智利造成的损害小于通过民选上台的左翼政府可能带来的危害。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1970年9月4日，智利举行总统选举，再次参选的阿连德得票第一，但未获得半数以上选票。按照法律规定，需由国会在得票前两名的候选人中投票选出总统。眼见拉美即将出现“第二个古巴”，惊慌失措的美国政府决定加大干涉力度，全力阻止阿连德在国会投票中获胜。9月15日，时任美国总统尼克松向中情局局长理查德·赫尔姆斯等人下达指示：“不要考虑风险，不要把大使馆牵扯进来，1000万美元可用资金，必要时再增加。全天工作，选派我们最好的人……让智利的经济痛苦尖叫，48小时内拿出行动计划。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中情局拿出的方案是在智利策动军事政变。中情局后来解密的文件显示，美方当时向一些智利军官承诺，一旦他们发动政变，美国将提供除直接出兵之外的任何援助。时任智利陆军司令雷涅·施奈德坚决反对政变，因此成为中情局的“眼中钉”。1970年10月22日，他遭到一个与中情局有关联的团伙袭击，几天后不治身亡。美国此举弄巧成拙，震惊了智利全国，反对外国干涉的呼声高涨。在10月24日举行的国会投票中，阿连德以明显优势胜出，当选智利总统。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;政治层面，据美国《纽约时报》报道，美国政府曾拨款81.5万美元，用于在阿连德政府内各党派之间制造分裂。1970年至1973年间，中情局在智利一共花费超过800万美元，其中大部分用于资助右翼反对派团体组织的罢工、示威等活动。与此同时，在1964年智利选举中打磨成熟的中情局“黑色宣传机器”高速运转。智利记者维克托·埃雷罗搜集的资料显示，仅在1973年9月15日至11月3日间，中情局就通过各种渠道在智利国内外发表了726篇抹黑文章，指责阿连德想对媒体施加管控。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经济层面，美国政府为打击智利经济，一方面阻止世界银行和国际货币基金组织等国际金融机构向智利提供贷款，另一方面在国际市场上压低铜价，打击铜产品出口这一智利重要外汇来源。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;军事层面，美国政府公布的《智利秘密行动1963-1973》报告显示，美国持续向智利军方提供援助，对智利军售额也保持在高位，同时还培训大批智利军官，在智利军队内培养亲美势力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在美国一系列破坏打压手段的作用下，到1973年政变发生前夕，阿连德政府已陷入困境：政府内部分裂严重，国内物价飞涨、抗议频发，军队内部也愈发不稳定。最终，在这一年的9月11日，时任智利陆军司令奥古斯托·皮诺切特发动政变，推翻了阿连德政府。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“如果没有美国的支持与资金援助，智利反对派的势力不会那么强。”智利历史学家维克托·布朗吉耶告诉新华社记者。智利学界普遍认为，美国的干涉为智利军队发动政变创造了条件，导致了阿连德政府的垮台。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此后，长达17年的军政府统治给智利造成了巨大伤害。智利官方数据显示，这一时期，智利有超过4万人因政治原因被捕，3000多人死在秘密警察手中或失踪，至少有20万人被迫流亡海外。对此，美国难辞其咎。正如英国《卫报》一篇文章所说：“美国的手上沾满智利人的鲜血。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;智利共产党众议员路易斯·奎略说，美国的干涉“深刻改变了智利的历史进程，违反国际法对各国选择其政治、社会制度权利的保护，是对人权的系统性侵犯”。智利前参议员亚历杭德罗·纳瓦罗说：“美国从来都不关心美洲人民的民主，只关心自己的经济和政治利益。美国将智利和拉美国家都视为自己的&#39;财产&#39;，任何影响美国利益的人都会自动成为其敌人。”&lt;/p>;

&lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“门罗主义”是帝国主义强权政治&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;阿连德的悲剧充分暴露了美国的虚伪与霸道。拉美地区的历史证明，当一些国家的政府不合美国之意，华盛顿的政客们就会毫不犹豫地策划鼓动政变，甚至手持屠刀亲自上场。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1915年，海地发生动乱，美国以“保护侨民”为由出兵海地，对该国实施全面控制，直至1934年才撤军。20世纪50年代初，危地马拉政府推行土地改革，将美资联合果品公司的闲置土地分给无地农民。美国政府在联合果品公司游说下，扶持卡斯蒂略·阿马斯发动政变推翻了政府。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美国的种种行径在拉美激起不满。近年来，拉美国家反对美国霸权的意志越来越强烈：2022年3月，巴拿马政府宣布将每年12月20日定为“全国哀悼日”，以纪念美国1989年对巴拿马军事行动中的遇害者；今年1月拉美和加勒比国家共同体峰会期间，与会领导人共同敦促美国结束对古巴的长期封锁；6月，尼加拉瓜总统奥尔特加向联合国秘书长古特雷斯致信，要求美国支付超过120亿美元的赔偿款，履行国际法院20世纪80年代对美国资助尼加拉瓜内战一事作出的判决。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;玻利维亚前外长费尔南多·瓦纳库尼日前接受新华社记者采访时指出，200年来，美国抱持“门罗主义”，将拉美视为“后院”，以霸权主义和干涉行径阻碍拉美国家发展，攫取拉美地区资源。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“&#39;门罗主义&#39;的本质是干涉拉美国家，在拉美推行霸权主义，”瓦纳库尼说，“美国悍然干涉拉美国家内政的事例200年来不胜枚举。这完全就是帝国主义的强权政治，它注定会走向失败，因为越来越多的国家希望自主决定自己的民主、经济模式和国家治理模式。”&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;卢二妹为此付出的代价是十多万元的打赏。“有一个姐姐，打赏了五十多万，也没追回来。”在秀才出事之前，卢二妹便对曾经的不冷静和异想天开感到后悔，“现在他的号被封死了，我就很开心”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年9月2日，坐拥上千万粉丝，素有“中老年女性收割机”之称的主播秀才，其短视频账号因违反平台相关规定被封禁。此前，秀才故作羞涩的招牌动作撩头发、捂嘴、抛媚眼，被竞相模仿、恶搞，在各大平台病毒般传播。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;秀才封禁事件也把他的“疯狂粉丝”暴露在镁光灯下。在秀才的粉丝当中，不乏卢二妹这样打赏金额高达十几万元甚至几十万元的“真爱粉”。这些老年情感向主播，究竟有什么样的魅力，能让粉丝们慷慨解囊？这些出手阔绰的中老年人，内心究竟在期盼着什么？&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;诱导性“打回流”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;卢二妹老家是安徽省怀宁县，在江苏省常熟市一家服装厂打工。因为在家族里排行老二，被称为卢二妹，她干脆就把短视频账号起名为“卢家二妹”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她成为秀才粉丝已有三四年时间。刚开始那会儿，秀才只有五六十万粉丝，后来一路飙升到上千万。“说是教我做视频，让我帮他打PK。”卢二妹对南方周末记者回忆二人最初的交流，因为给秀才刷礼物，得到很多与之交流的机会，建立起最初的信任。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据公开信息，秀才是安徽省蒙城人，39岁。他家境一般，早年间和老婆在苏州打工，孩子留在老家读寄宿学校。几年前，在同学的建议下，开始拍摄短视频，刚开始是以农民工题材为主，慢慢转成着西装、对口型唱歌的主播。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;渐渐地，卢二妹萌生起做短视频的想法。她把和秀才的合成视频发在账号上，积累了一些粉丝。不过，要想得到曝光露脸的机会，最直接的方式是在直播间里和秀才互动，而这需要刷礼物。从最基础的小心心、金链子、热气球，到价值不菲的保时捷、直升机，卢二妹一路刷上来，于是频频得到秀才的赞美：妹妹长得挺漂亮、妹妹就要听哥哥的话，等等。秀才还夸二妹视频做得不错，粉丝涨得快，卢二妹很开心，回复说，都是你带得好。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;卢二妹得到秀才带她做账号的承诺，但是索要打赏的要求也愈来愈多。“就让我帮他打PK，喊我去直播间里搭把手。”所谓的打PK，是直播平台中常见的人气比拼形式，主播连麦展示才艺或技巧，号召各自的粉丝通过打赏的方式“上票”，谁得到的打赏多，谁便是PK赛的胜者。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在激烈的角逐中，秀才频频提出打赏“马车”“华子”的要求，“华子”是礼物“嘉年华”的俗称，折合人民币3000元。最多的一次，卢二妹在一场直播中打赏了4000余元，几年下来，她自称消耗掉十几万元的积蓄。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“做账号，带徒弟是比较常见的形式。”梁州（网名）是社交平台上一位知识型博主，她曾在一家MCN公司负责虚拟主播业务，作为短视频平台的深度用户和长期观察者，她因为系列分析“秀才”现象的博文引发关注。她向南方周末记者说，这种承诺教人做账号从而讨要打赏的方式，存在一定程度的欺骗性和诱导性。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;梁州分析，除了“教做账号”的形式外，更多且直接的诱导方式是“打回流”：“就是当托，把直播间人气拉上来。”所谓的打回流是指，主播和粉丝事先约定，粉丝帮忙在直播间刷礼物衬托人气，私下里主播再将其花费金额返还。不过，因为平台会抽水一半，打回流的成本很高，而且由于涉及数据造假，平台并不提倡，甚至是禁止这一行为。所以，打回流通常是MCN机构为了捧新人才会运用的操作。个人的打回流承诺，往往涉嫌一定的诱导、欺骗。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据媒体报道，一位来自北京的62岁女性称，她通过刷礼物的形式向秀才打赏52万余元。她称，之所以如此豪爽，是因为秀才向她承诺，不会亏待她，还会把钱返回，但是承诺一直没有兑现。最近三年，她一直在向秀才讨要这52万元，但是只追回来1.7万元。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“他这无情无义的东西”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;不过，卢二妹的短视频账号没有做起来，粉丝数量停留在一万多，她也没有财力继续打赏，秀才便也不再在直播间里搭理她。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“他说是自愿刷礼物，别人也不可能拿我的手机刷对不对？”2021年，卢二妹去到安徽蒙城找秀才理论，遭到对方的数落，后来还被对方拉黑，“他这无情无义的东西”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;虽然混杂着做短视频账号的想法，但是在粉丝心目中，最被吸引的原因，还是主播提供的情绪价值，只是这种价值需要金钱供养。“这类主播，其实&#39;整活&#39;能力比较差。”梁州分析，很多直播间为了吸引粉丝，会搭建影棚，灯光、道具和陈设一应俱全，才艺展示很丰富，有的还会设计剧本，相对而言，老年人情感向的直播套路会少很多，“老年人不喜欢吵，他们需要的是陪伴”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/UXZYTnTr7JHSV5qkyvCfGgwpNodqtpXVV7xWen9D.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;452&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/UXZYTnTr7JHSV5qkyvCfGgwpNodqtpXVV7xWen9D.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250515&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;秀才的经典羞涩表情。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（网络截图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;梁州注册一个新账号，刻意点赞、收藏老年人视频，从而喂养这个账号的“习惯”，由此打开一个新世界。她第一次在首页推荐里，刷到老年人集体连麦的直播间，连线的用户皆为六十多岁的男性，他们也打PK，观众可以指定他们当中的主播“开擂台”，然后分别给他们上票。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，这场PK没有任何才艺展示，只有和粉丝语音聊天，聊天对象多是中老年女性。梁州通过聊天内容判断，两人彼此熟悉，并不是第一次连麦，主播通过即时通讯软件，喊粉丝过来帮忙“上票”。聊天内容也很寻常：今天喝的什么茶？路好走不好走？下雨了，千万别出门，鞋子会沾上泥。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“这些话，肯定是她在家里听不到的。”梁州说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通过视频和留言判断，这位主播大爷年轻时办过企业，在他们当地村子里算是头面人物。不过，虽然他比秀才年长很多，但是视频风格大同小异，固定场景、固定音乐，通常捧着紫砂壶在泡茶。大爷的账号只有一两万粉丝，但是互动量很高，每个视频都有好几千个点赞，评论数更是接近点赞的一半或是三分之一。通过这一次PK，大爷主播上了6000余票，折合成钱，可以拿到手300元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;秀才最早出圈，是因为2023年5月，一位七旬老太独自坐火车去安徽蒙城寻求线下见面。张姐是秀才同学，曾做过一段时间的短视频拍档，她自称，后来和秀才关系恶化，是因为她发现秀才以答应和粉丝私下见面为诱导，要求粉丝打赏大额礼物。张姐认为，这突破了道德底线，不是一件很光彩的事情。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张姐自认是秀才做短视频的领路人，看到这样的局面感到惭愧，2023年7月，她开始在短视频平台上公开征集被秀才“诱骗”的受害人。一个二十多岁的女孩求助说，父母已经离异，母亲喜欢上秀才后，给对方打赏一万多元，还念叨着要去寻找秀才，她和哥哥怎么劝都劝不住。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“七十几岁的老太太来这里，具体有没有给他打赏不清楚，但是老太太能来到我们这里，绝对他俩是有联系的。”张姐对南方周末记者说。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;秀才的粉丝们&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;梁州还翻阅了上文中大爷主播一位活跃粉丝的账号，其人物形象十分清晰：早年间事业有成，如今丧偶，儿子已经成婚，在大城市定居，她留在老家独居。尤其令人印象深刻的是，这位女性分享欲很强，最多的一次，一天就发了33条视频。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“她似乎没有一个可以在现实生活里说话的人。”梁州说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我支持奶奶刷秀才短视频。”小谢是一位90后，参加工作三年，她向南方周末记者介绍，她的奶奶68岁，前些年身体硬朗的时候，还会去跳一跳广场舞，2022年不小心摔跤导致骨折，康复后很少出门，养成了刷手机的习惯。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;小谢说，她的爷爷早在几年前便用上了智能手机，整天抱着手机刷。爷爷奶奶平时生活中本来就很少交流，爷爷迷上刷手机后，两人更少说话。直到奶奶也用上智能手机，情感有了很大寄托。两个老人家经常刷到晚上一两点才睡，“可以说非常痴迷”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，小谢发现，奶奶的辨别能力非常低，之前很喜欢“假靳东”，但是她看不出来是假的，后来喜欢秀才，视频平台慢慢也冒出很多模仿、冒充秀才的账号，奶奶同样识别不出真假。“分不清是平台还是主播，是机构还是个人，反正她都信。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;每次回去，奶奶会阐述一下自己的择偶观，嘱托孙女，要找就找秀才这一类型的男生做对象，不仅长得好看，还很有本事，同时又善解人意、嘘寒问暖。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;奶奶也动过给秀才打赏的念头。小谢每次回去，她会给爷爷奶奶清理手机内存，取关一些不可靠的账号。她发现，奶奶手机里收到过打赏失败、绑定银行卡失败的短信。“年纪大了，不会操作这些。”两位老人的手机一直就没绑定银行卡。家里人意识到，应该不会挥霍什么钱财，只要老人家高兴，就放心让他们刷短视频。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不光老年人，刷短视频也是卢二妹的精神寄托。“在厂里上班太累，手脚都要动。”卢二妹夫妻俩在江苏常熟的服装厂结识，结婚已经有十多年，不过多年来，老公辗转于常熟、苏州等地打工，两人聚少离多。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在服装厂上班非常枯燥，每个月只放3天假。因为做账号、打赏，她和丈夫的感情出现严重危机，丈夫一个人跑到苏州去干活，两个人很少联系，基本处于冷战状态，“他（老公）怀疑，以为我背叛他似的”。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“老去不意味放弃一切需求”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“老年人的盲目追星跟我们不一样，我们追星买一张演唱会票，至少这种东西都是表面上能看到的，他们是内在的（情感需求）。”张姐说，很多老年人的精神世界里，情感比较匮乏，空虚的内心无法得到安慰。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张姐补充说，男性通常比女性早离世，留下老太太一个人；也有的是男人要去外面赚钱，女人留守，她们的感情世界普遍空虚。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“之前，我看到一个帖子说，女性到了一定年纪，分泌激素下降，就没有性欲了，这肯定是不对的。”梁州说，当一个人步入老年，似乎就在社会意义上丧失了活力这一概念，而这也代表着，与之相关的情欲与情感需求，都不应该出现在老年人身上——这显然是非常不正确的认知。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“陪伴、幽默、爱、谈话和其他许多东西，都是人类的本质需求。我们在年轻时希望得到这一切，但当我们步入老年，年岁的老去并不意味着我们放弃了这一切需求。而社会与周围的人，更不应该直接忽视这一系列需求，这是对基本责任放弃的体现。”梁州说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“秀才走红过程中，老年女性也好，中老年人也好，喜欢秀才我觉得无可厚非。”北京师范大学发展心理研究院教授彭华茂做了多年老年人心理认知、训练的研究，她在观察了一些秀才的短视频和粉丝留言后，认为这些留言是一种较为张扬的情感表达，反映的是老年人的情感需求，“这些评论，有好多是女性对情感的渴求，或者说，对内心自己情感需求的觉醒”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;彭华茂分析，这一群体的情感需求，平时很少得到外界关注，尤其是在中老年女性身上尤为明显。“年轻的时候，都是为家庭生活，到老了以后，在家庭当中的价值没有体现。”她说，与其探究为什么秀才受欢迎，不如去关注中老年人在现实生活当中，他们的情感需求如何满足。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;彭华茂说，社会普遍存在一个认知误区即爱会随着年龄增长而减弱，这才使得大家漠视老年人的心理。而过度的嘲讽和污名化，反而会掩盖掉本质的问题。“所以，我觉得给秀才打赏也好，关注秀才也好，其实都表达了她需要有一个精神的寄托。”&lt;/p>;
