(Pien Tze Huang, composed of bezoars, musk, notoginseng, and snake gall, is used to clear away heat. Detoxify, cool blood and remove blood stasis, reduce swelling and relieve pain. This small pill is said to have been introduced from the Ming Dynasty. The company that manufactured it was founded in 1956 and has been on the market for 20 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Pien Tze Huang has reached a turning point again.” Li Bin, a long-term holder of Pien Tze Huang shares, private equity fund manager Li Bin, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 6, 2023, Lin Zhihui, the new chairman of Pien Tze Huang (600436.SH), with a total market value of more than 164 billion and known as the &quot;Moutai of Medicine&quot; by the market, attended the 6th &quot;Belt and Road Initiative&quot; Traditional Chinese Medicine Development Forum. Investors believe this is his first appearance since becoming the new chairman in early August. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is Pien Tze Huang’s fourth coaching change since 2021. The previous two chairman of the board were investigated by the Discipline Inspection Commission for suspected serious violations of disciplines and laws. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of August, the Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision of Zhangzhou City, Fujian Province released information that Liu Jianshun, who had served as chairman of Pien Tze Huang for seven years, was expelled from the party for violating laws and disciplines. He will retire in 2021. Pan Jie, who succeeded him, was also subject to disciplinary review and supervisory investigation by the Zhangzhou Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision in May for suspected serious violations of discipline and law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to incomplete statistics from Southern Weekend reporters, five executives of Pien Tze Huang and its subsidiaries have been investigated in 2023. From June 2022 to the present, Pien Tze Huang’s board secretary, chief engineer, chief auditor, etc. Many senior executives have resigned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of Lu Dingliang, a lawyer at Jingshi Law Firm, the products of traditional Chinese medicine companies such as Pien Tze Huang leave room for power rent-seeking due to their certain resource nature and scarcity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The number of Pien Tze Huang executives who have been investigated is relatively prominent, which is closely related to the company’s stock price, product selling price and scarcity.” He analyzed to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Chairman of &quot;Liu Shui&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Zhangzhou Pien Tze Huang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. was founded in 1999 by the restructuring of Zhangzhou Pharmaceutical Factory, which was established in 1956. , currently has 13 directly held subsidiaries and 9 joint-stock companies. Its controlling shareholder is a state-owned enterprise in Zhangzhou City. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of August, the Zhangzhou Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision released information that former chairman Liu Jianshun was expelled from the party for serious violations of discipline and law. It mentioned that he &quot;received gifts and large amounts of money in violation of regulations; relied on enterprises to support enterprises, and took advantage of his position to provide Others seek benefits and accept huge amounts of property from others.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Jianshun is 60 years old and served as chairman of Pien Tze Huang from 2014 to 2021. During this period, Pien Tze Huang’s revenue increased from 1.4 billion yuan to 6.5 billion yuan, and the stock price rose from 21 yuan/share to 4 in 2021. The monthly highest price is around 350 yuan/share. Three months after he left office, Pien Tze Huang experienced a period of intense speculation, with its stock price rising to a new high of 480 yuan per share, and Pien Tze Huang tablets on the market selling for thousands of yuan per pill. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2021, Liu Jianshun retired early due to &quot;personal physical reasons&quot; and resigned from relevant positions. Pan Jie, who had served as general manager of Pien Tze Huang and other positions, took over as chairman. But within eight months, Pan Jie resigned from the relevant position on the grounds of &quot;work adjustment.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the &quot;&lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;http://static.sse.com.cn/disclosure/listedinfo/announcement/c/new/2022-04-16/600436_20220416_6_1FsQWSqY. pdf&quot;>;Zhangzhou Pien Tze Huang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. 2021 Social Responsibility Report and ESG (Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance) Report&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&quot; mentioned that in 2021, Pien Tze Huang established the &quot;Zhangzhou Municipal Supervisory Committee in Office of the Ombudsman of Zhangzhou Pien Tze Huang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July of the same year, according to information on Pien Tze Huang’s official website, the Discipline Inspection and Supervision Offices of three Pien Tze Huang-owned enterprises, including Cosmetics Co., Ltd., were established, achieving full coverage of supervision of all public officials exercising public power in the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2021, Lin Weiqi, a member of the Party Committee and Deputy Director of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of Zhangzhou City, Fujian Province, became the new chairman of Pien Tze Huang. During his tenure from June to July 2022, the then secretary of the board of directors, deputy general manager, supervisor, chief engineer, and chief auditor resigned one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Less than 17 months after taking office, in July 2023, Lin Weiqi resigned from the company due to &quot;work adjustment&quot;. A month later, Lin Zhihui became Pien Tze Huang&#39;s new chairman. According to the announcement issued by Pien Tze Huang, Lin Zhihui has served as a member of the Standing Committee of the Zhangzhou Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and a member of the Zhangzhou Municipal Supervisory Committee. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taking stock of official notifications over the past year: In May, former chairman Pan Jie was subject to disciplinary review and supervisory investigation by the Zhangzhou Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision on suspicion of serious violations of discipline and law; in June, the former deputy director of Pien Tze Huang Cosmetics Co., Ltd. Chairman Yang Puquan was put on file for review and investigation for serious violations of disciplines and laws; in August, former chairman Lin Jinsheng of Pien Tze Huang Cosmetics Co., Ltd. was expelled from the party and public office for serious violations of disciplines and laws; at the end of August, former chairman Liu Jianshun was expelled from the party for serious violations of disciplines and laws. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In these intensive notifications, words such as &quot;relying on enterprises to eat enterprises&quot; and &quot;seeking personal gain&quot; were mentioned. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;More corruption problems occur in dealers&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;How much impact does frequent coaching changes have on the company? Pien Tze Huang&#39;s stock price has dropped from the highest of 482.33 yuan per share at the end of 2021 to the current price of 271.98 yuan per share, a drop of 43%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Bin believes that Pien Tze Huang has a very mature brand, system and customer base, so the role of management is relatively downplayed, and the replacement of senior executives will have little impact on the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the financial report, from 2020 to 2022, Pien Tze Huang’s revenue increased from 6.511 billion yuan to 8.694 billion yuan, and its net profit increased from 1.672 billion yuan to 2.472 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Bin said, &quot;Generally speaking, Pien Tze Huang&#39;s main sales channels are not in hospitals, but in pharmacies and the Internet.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the financial report, in 2021, Pien Tze Huang&#39;s operating income was 8.022 billion yuan, and sales expenses were 650 million yuan. In 2022, operating income was 8.694 billion yuan, and sales expenses were 483 million yuan. Selling expenses account for 8.1%-5.55% of revenue. In comparison, the IPO report of Hanwang Pharmaceutical, a traditional Chinese medicine pharmaceutical company, showed that sales expenses accounted for more than 80% of its main business revenue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Dingliang believes that traditional Chinese medicine is different from Western medicine and equipment. “The public relations focus of medical equipment and Western medicine is to have a good relationship with doctors and hospitals. But the corruption of traditional Chinese medicine in the C-end market is more about distribution. Corruption issues have arisen in the business chain.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the financial report, Pien Tze Huang’s domestic sales model is mainly OTC, that is, over-the-counter drugs. The main sales channel for prescription drugs is hospitals, and for over-the-counter drugs is pharmacies. Pien Tze Huang&#39;s sales channels include Pien Tze Huang experience centers, retail pharmacies and regional distributors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Pien Tze Huang Experience Center&quot; appeared for the first time in the 2015 financial report. There were more than 20 experience centers that year. By the end of 2020, there were more than 300 “Pien Tze Huang Experience Centers” operating across the country. According to a report by China International Finance Securities in August 2023, there are nearly 400 Pien Tze Huang experience centers across the country, covering more than 100,000 terminal stores. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Liang became the person in charge of a Pien Tze Huang experience center in 2019. In his view, the changes in Pien Tze Huang’s management will not have a big impact on the experience center he runs. In comparison, the impact of price increases is more direct. &quot;The market is indeed relatively weak now, and the experience center itself does not want to increase prices. After the price increase, sales will decline,&quot; he told a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although it is still growing, Pien Tze Huang&#39;s revenue growth rate in 2022 is the lowest in five years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2023, Pien Tze Huang stated that due to reasons such as the increase in main raw materials and labor costs, it would increase the domestic market retail price of its main product Pien Tze Huang tablets from 590 yuan/tablet to 760 yuan/tablet, and the supply price would be increased accordingly. About 170 yuan per pill, the largest price increase in history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Pien Tze Huang&#39;s 2003 prospectus, in 2000, the average domestic sales price of Pien Tze Huang was 93.2 yuan per pill. In twenty years, the price increase has been as high as 715%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the ex-factory price is 390 yuan/tablet, the market retail price of Pien Tze Huang tablets is 590 yuan/tablet. How much is the difference between the current ex-factory price and retail price of Pien Tze Huang tablets? Zhang Liang said, &quot;The ex-factory price is confidential, but our price difference is not high and cannot be compared with Moutai.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A long-term investor in Pien Tze Huang told a Southern Weekend reporter, &quot;This price adjustment (to 760 yuan), as far as I know, the ex-factory price should be 560 yuan.&quot; That is, the difference between the ex-factory price and the retail price is 200 yuan/pill, the same as before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person in charge of the Pien Tze Huang Experience Center who is familiar with Li Bin also believes that after the price increase, there will be a certain impact on sales within half a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Generally, sales will gradually return to normal after half a year. This year&#39;s price increase directly increases the ex-factory price and retail price by the same amount. In other words, the profit from the price increase belongs to Pien Tze Huang Company, and the profit It will be reflected in the performance, and the dealers will not make more money,&quot; Li Bin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the 2023 semi-annual report, the gross profit margin of Pien Tze Huang pharmaceutical manufacturing industry was 74.2%. In the 2022 annual report, this figure was 78.7%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person in charge of a traditional Chinese medicine company told a Southern Weekend reporter, &quot;The high profits of traditional Chinese medicine companies do not mean high profits for dealers. Products that can be sold at the C-end will not have much price difference.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“ &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Depend on the success of the enterprise &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;” &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;A senior person in the pharmaceutical industry told Southern Weekend Reporter, in terms of drug research and development, Pien Tze Huang is a national secret formula with mysterious origin and high price. It seems to be widely used, but the price/performance ratio is unclear, but the sales volume is very impressive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the official website of the State Drug Administration, the protection level of Pien Tze Huang is level 1, which is the highest level. Among the national traditional Chinese medicine varieties, only Pien Tze Huang and Yunnan Baiyao are national top-secret formulas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pien Tze Huang is now known as &quot;Moutai of Medicine&quot;, and the last one to be so called was Dong&#39;e Ejiao. From 2001 to the end of 2018, the price of Dong&#39;e Ejiao has been raised 18 times, an increase of 37 times. The reason for the price increase is &quot;the shortage of donkey skin resources.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person in charge of the above-mentioned traditional Chinese medicine company also used Dong&#39;e E-jiao as an example. The profits of Dong&#39;e E-jiao dealers are also very thin. If the dealers stock up, the company will give a slight discount. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The gameplay is to stock up downstream + increase prices. Frequent price increases are also because listed companies want to increase profits. I find Pien Tze Huang (price increases) a bit confusing, but only this type of company can have excess profits &quot;, he told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2018, Dong&#39;e Ejiao&#39;s growth has stagnated, and in 2019 it suffered its first loss in 23 years since its listing. From 2017 to 2019, the company&#39;s book inventory exceeded 3 billion yuan. It began cutting prices and selling stakes in its subsidiaries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2023, Dong&#39;e Ejiao (000423.SZ) issued continuous personnel change announcements. The then chairman and vice president both resigned due to &quot;job changes.&quot; This is the third chairman the company has replaced since November 2019. Similar to Pien Tze Huang, three chairmen resigned in three years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2020, nine senior executives including Qin Yufeng, the president of Dong&#39;e Ejiao, the assistant president, and the vice president resigned one after another. Two years later, Qin Yufeng was suspected of serious violations of discipline and law and is currently undergoing disciplinary review and supervisory investigation by the Discipline Inspection Commission of China Resources Pharmaceutical Holdings Co., Ltd. and the Supervisory Committee of Liaocheng City, Shandong Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar to them, there is Tongrentang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2021, when Pien Tze Huang was on the rise, Tongrentang (600085.SH) raised the terminal retail price of Angong Niuhuang Pills from 780 yuan to 860 yuan, saying it was due to the rise in raw materials for traditional Chinese medicine. Since then, many Prices of varieties have been raised one after another. Angong Niuhuang Pills is the core product of Tongrentang. In 2022, Tongrentang&#39;s revenue was 15.4 billion yuan, and the top five products, including Angong Niuhuang Pills, achieved revenue of 4.5 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2021, relevant reports published on the website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the State Supervisory Commission mentioned that Gao Zhenkun, the former general manager of Beijing Tongrentang, made more than 15 million yuan in profits from the purchase of raw materials for Angong Niuhuang Pills. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The article mentioned that when making Rentang’s signature patent medicines such as Angong Niuhuang Pills, Dahuoluo Pills, and Niuhuang Qingxin Pills, leopard bone, musk, antelope horn, bezoar and other ingredients are indispensable, and these are in high demand. , endangered fine materials with high profits, Gao Zhenkun saw huge space for rent-seeking power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During his tenure at Tongrentang Group Secondary Enterprise Co., Ltd., Gao Zhenkun firmly held the power to purchase fine materials and used his supply and information advantages to make private profits of more than 15 million yuan. In order to maintain the relationship with Gao Zhenkun, many suppliers competed to provide food and clothing for him. Gao Zhenkun could get the key to a two-bedroom rental house by casually saying, &quot;The children go to school far away.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relevant information about Wang Qingquan, the deputy general manager and operating branch manager of Tong Ren Tang, who accepted bribes published on the Judgment Documents website, mentioned that he took advantage of his position to repeatedly offer bribes to relevant parties at internal prices that were significantly lower than those stipulated by the group. Buy Angong Niuhuang Pills. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the currently released information on the investigation of relevant executives of Pien Tze Huang, &quot;depending on the enterprise to eat the enterprise&quot; has been mentioned many times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Lu Dingliang’s view, traditional Chinese medicine products are fields with many intermediate links, large profit margins, high professional and technical barriers, and insufficient procurement transparency. These characteristics provide room for corruption. At the same time, the method of transferring benefits in this field is relatively hidden, making it difficult to discover corrupt behaviors, obtain clues, and form evidence chains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“For traditional Chinese medicine, which faces the C-end market, the products are scarce and irreplaceable to a certain extent. If dealers obtain the right to sell, the profit margin will be relatively large, and they will provide a It’s possible,” he told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, Pien Tze Huang’s stock price once rose to 483.69 yuan/share. As of press time, it was reported at 269.81 yuan/share, a drop of more than 40%. But for Li Bin, a long-term holder of Pien Tze Huang, he is more optimistic about Pien Tze Huang&#39;s performance in half a year since the price increase in May. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(At the request of the interviewee, Zhang Liang’s pseudonym is used in this article.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[澳研究发现可致儿童痴呆症的145种遗传病]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257000]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-20 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Australian researchers recently identified 145 genetic diseases that can cause childhood dementia, aiming to improve the Awareness of the severity of these diseases. Relevant research results have been published in the quarterly journal Brain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dementia in children is caused by progressive brain damage caused by a range of genetic disorders. Just like adults with dementia, children with dementia can experience memory loss, confusion, personality changes, severe sleep disturbances, and difficulties with concentration, comprehension, learning, and communication. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A research team led by the University of Adelaide in Australia conducted modeling and analysis of published data from this country and overseas. The results showed that symptoms of childhood dementia usually begin to appear when patients are two and a half years old. The average age at diagnosis is about four years. The average life expectancy of patients is only 9 years, and 70% of patients die before the age of 18. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers said that the 145 genetic diseases that cause childhood dementia are very complex and diverse, such as Krabbe disease, Sandhoff disease, Huntington&#39;s disease, etc., but the common point is that they all cause progressive Sexual neurocognitive decline and severely shortened life expectancy. The findings provide a clearer picture of who is vulnerable to the effects of these devastating and under-recognized diseases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers are calling for greater investment in research into effective treatments for childhood dementia, while there is an urgent need to improve care and support for affected families. This new study will increase awareness among researchers, clinicians, governments and policymakers of the severity of these diseases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[江苏宿迁遭遇强龙卷风，灾情造成5人死亡4人重伤]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257182]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-20 13:32:55&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;At about 17:20 on September 19, Daxing Town, Suyu District, Suqian City, Jiangsu Province Economic Development Strong tornadoes occurred one after another in Cai Township in the southern part of the district.

Yesterday I watched the movie &quot;&quot; adapted from Agatha&#39;s novel &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; finds director Kenneth Branagh starring as detective Poirot, who also plays Professor Niels Bohr in Nolan&#39;s latest film &quot;Oppenheimer.&quot; Oppenheimer thought that his tutor was too much and did not allow him to attend a long-awaited lecture. He injected potassium cyanide into the apple. The next day he remembered that he ran away and found the apple in the hands of Professor Bohr. When Bohr was about to eat, Oppenheimer stopped him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to understand human despair? Oppenheimer was desperate at that moment. The taste of a good movie will make people imagine. My family said that before he met me, he was on vacation in South France. He thought that life was unpredictable, his heart was empty and he had no cares. He walked toward the river, and was discovered by his friends and caught on the river bank. Not long after, he met me at a birthday party in England. He said that your hair was half long and half short at that time, which was very avant-garde. I say people are like this. If you are extremely miserable inside and don’t live a decent life, you will use external forms to dilute the pain, such as intentionally or unintentionally tending to be abnormal, or even clothes and shoes. Good guy, I wore high heels for many years. With such irregular hair. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, you don’t have a tattoo. He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If I had a tattoo, would you still fall in love with me? I asked him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said, even if you had, I would never have been disgusted with you at that time. When people meet at the right time, everything will be forgiven and tolerated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This made me think deeply. So many things have happened in the past three years, and everyone&#39;s destiny has changed. I used to be a fetishist. Everywhere I went, I would collect souvenirs, ranging from a small piece of porcelain to a large sculpture. I loved looking for old postcards and stamps at antique flea markets. One year I attended the Frankfurt Book Fair, and I happily walked around the largest open-air market in the area with my friends. When I saw an old carpet with a silver spoon, I took it without a counter-offer. Now I won&#39;t accept it. There are so many things outside my body and it&#39;s so tiring. Except for books, I don’t throw them away. From last year to this year, I have been cleaning out necessary and unnecessary items, extra pots, bowls, chopsticks, extra clothes, shoes and furniture. The house gradually became a little empty, and I felt relieved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Being alive is better than anything else. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This movie and this story &quot;Moonlight Samurai&quot; was the first time I heard it from my family and neighbors when I was five years old. A family was walking on the wide and long stone steps of Middle School Street. The mother above was wearing a kimono. We have to return to Japan. Below is the father and his three daughters rushing behind. On both sides of the stone steps are people watching. Decades passed, and that scene kept flashing in my mind. From this, I wrote a short story of less than 3,000 words, and then rewritten it into a script of 50,000 words, and then changed the script into a novel of more than 200,000 words. Every character came alive in my heart. After the novel was published, I broke down the previous script and rewrote it. Each scene was based on the actual situation and actors were found according to the image of the characters in the script. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The early stage of a movie involves script preparation, preparation of funds and team, and then shooting. The later stage involves editing, sound, music, and color grading and special effects. The early stage is difficult, and the late stage is even more difficult. Many people will lose patience during this process. I strive to absorb fresh professional knowledge, research and think, so that my hearing, smell, and intuition are always in a sharp state. It’s like walking from one distant country to another. You must first determine the location, plan the route, prepare the equipment needed along the way, and then put aside all worries. No one can dissuade you. They all say that the road ahead is a trap, a pit, and a road of no return. , but I don’t believe it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Strong wind and heavy rain? This happens too often and there is no need to be afraid. Robbers appear on the road, beggars appear on the road, and smiling tigers appear on the road. Tang Monk, when you go to the West to obtain Buddhist scriptures, you meet monsters who want to eat your flesh in order to live forever. As for me, everything I encounter is God’s way of testing my sincerity towards movies. The film is so bitter and hard that it is completely inedible and must be swallowed whole. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/jMsUG4dRkoKT9WR4Q0OnBQP75lqpYKXZLydTKIQG.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;949&quot; height= &quot;607&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/jMsUG4dRkoKT9WR4Q0OnBQP75lqpYKXZLydTKIQG.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251099&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The heroine Qin Jiahui of &quot;Moonlight Warrior&quot; is a nurse who first met Dou Xiaoming, a 12-year-old boy at work.

You are too brave to cross the border from a writer to the film industry to make such a nostalgic and unflattering movie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Occasionally I will express my opinion, and sometimes I will remain silent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The young male protagonist Dou Xiaoming in &quot;Moonlight Samurai&quot; is played by Zuo Hang. Many of his fans urged &quot;Moonlight Samurai&quot; to be released as soon as possible on Weibo, and even said unpleasant things. I expressed my opinion on Weibo, saying that the cycle of making movies is not what they imagined. The filming of this movie was at the end of 2021, and the post-production period was a year, because during the epidemic, many of the post-production companies, including the main creators, were in isolation. It has only been less than three months since our film received the Dragon Award. We have been doing follow-up work and looking for the most suitable promotion company. It’s not that we don’t want to go to theaters and meet the audience as soon as possible. The tweet attracted polarizing comments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In depression, I recalled my favorite Chinese and foreign movies, and thought of the scene in &quot;Tunnel War&quot; in which the Japanese invaded the village and were beaten and fled; I thought of the figure running in the wilderness in &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;; I think of the piano music in &quot;Casablanca&quot;; I think of the charming desert in &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;; I think of the long shot of the boy finally walking to the seaside in &quot;The 400 Blows&quot;, the endless sea and the cloudless sky; I think of the endless sea and cloudless sky; In &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; the heroine walks down the stairs with rays of sunshine. I try to be calm, accept the things I can&#39;t change, and try to change the things I can. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was immersed in my own work and didn’t have time to pay attention to you, but you immediately kicked me out of your world and ran counter to me. We were such good friends and relatives. Because of making this movie, I I have lost you, and I have also lost my eldest sister who was born to the same mother. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yes, I have encountered many things that make me inexplicably sad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From time to time I meet people asking me why I didn’t contact him/her before making a movie? Claiming that if I find him/her, my movie will have stars, funding, and will have greater commercial value. I said, if I come to you then, you will not pay attention to me. If you pay attention to me, it is not too late to extend a hand to me now. This kind of people say that the first-rate movies in the world are those with a cost of more than 500 million; the second-rate movies are those with less than 500 million, with big productions and big actors; and the third-rate movies are small productions with no stars. Hong Ying, you are making this third-rate movie. You are a writer, and it is your duty to be a writer. You want to promote your movie, which is just nonsense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I interrupted the other person: What I do is my business, and are you talking about a movie? You&#39;re talking about money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Money can produce movies. There is no first-rate, second-rate or third-rate money. Money is money, but money never equals movies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Film is art, the seventh art, Giotto. Kanudu said that film is a comprehensive art that includes static art and moving art, time art and space art, plastic art and rhythm art. Movies use lenses to tell stories, tell a story about a person who is gradually forgotten, tell long-standing legends, tell historical truths, and use visual and sound effects to tell the story of justice and ideal spirit that existed in long ago. Movies are about realizing impossible dreams. Movies use It’s just about making dreams. Without dreams, how can we make movies? How to watch movies?

I often ask myself, and I am also asked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many times it feels like the movie has entered my body, sucking my blood and aura. Do I walk into the river with stones in my arms? But the movie wouldn&#39;t let go of me, so I had no choice but to look back. I saw that when I was a child, I and my father were sitting on the bank of the Yangtze River, watching the boats sailing on the river. They were all in fixed focus, and they came to me frame by frame. They were the world. This world was not as gray and dark as the one I lived on the south bank of the river. Hopeless, so poor, this world has bright colors and hope, endless passion and love on the other side of the river. This is a movie that will always belong to those who are indomitable, believe in the good side of the world, and never lose the ability to love others and the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was dreaming that night, and I was standing on the Chongqing riverside again, together with the executive director, waiting for the ship to ship the filming equipment. Mist comes. I walked forward, the river flowed carefully, I could hear my own footsteps, and I saw an abandoned cable car in front of me. It was exactly the same as the one I had walked along the river thousands of times when I was a child. There was even a bridge hole. I walked over and immediately Walking back from the cave, I saw the fog dissipating, and the mountains, houses and some factory sheds on the other side were looming. The river was green and rippling with waves. Looking to the left, I saw the scenery of the Jialing River to the left of Chaotianmen in the center of Chongqing. I was extremely excited, and there was a wide beach on the right. I pointed there and said to the people around me, why should we go to the opposite side to shoot that fight scene? No, it is right here. This is the scene I was most familiar with when I was a child. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Somehow, I feel that this is a gift from Chongqing, where I was born and raised, to my firm heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I woke up and clearly remembered that it was a morning in the winter of 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two years, it seems like a long time, it seems like a blink of an eye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While writing this article, I read a Weibo post by Xiaofeng, the host of &quot;Xiaofeng Live Room&quot; on Weibo: &quot;&quot;Moonlight Samurai&quot; is really the most mysterious movie of the year, directed by the internationally renowned Hong Ying, winner of the Rome Prize for Literature, adapted it from her own novel and directed it for the first time. She loved this story so much. Pamuk liked &quot;The Museum of Innocence&quot;, but he just built a museum with limited time and space. It is unimaginable. He picked Füsun and Kemal by himself and let them sway in the old streets of Istanbul, but Hongying did it. She not only hypnotized us on paper, but followed Dou Xiaoming and Qin Jiahui into the winding mountain city Xiejie, also put their stories on the screen, allowing the dense atmosphere of the mountain city and the majestic beauty of the river to flow through our eyes. Congratulations to &quot;Moonlight Samurai&quot; for being nominated for the Best Screenplay Award at the Hollywood Next Generation Independent Film Award. This Another piece of much-anticipated good news.&#39; The film awards&#39; highest honor goes to outstanding storytellers and visionary filmmakers from around the world.&#39; Outstanding storytellers, yes, that five The girl who ran and shouted in the drizzle by the Yangtze River when she was young, the daughter who only found out about the river where she was born at the age of eighteen and has determined her life since then, she has always been the woman who lives by telling stories like Scheherazade!&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her words touched the softest part of my heart. Even if one person sees my walking track or notices my movies, I should be grateful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like Dou Xiaoming and Qin Jiahui, I was swaying on the steepest stone staircase in the mountain city. I saw the city lights pouring on the river little by little, and the tugboat came from the darkened confluence of the two rivers. , sounding the air horn, and someone holding a loudspeaker shouted, &quot;Stop at Pier 2,&quot; and then used local swear words in Chongqing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s such a familiar scene. It’s not someone else’s tugboat, it’s my father’s. From the old photos he showed me, I know its appearance and shape. Of course, it has long since become a pile of waste. Iron, but I imagined it appearing on the river more than a hundred times. I resurrected it in the movie and made it exist forever. My father, I believe that you will see this movie in Tianzhiling. This movie pays tribute to Chongqing and Chongqing people. It also pays tribute to foreigners and foreigners like you. Father, I believe that you will see this movie.

The article said that according to incomplete statistics, almost all car 4S stores within the Third Ring Road of Shijiazhuang City are involved, and there are more than 100 dealers of various brands. The large-scale relocation and reconstruction are expected to cause direct economic losses of more than 1 billion to the dealers. Yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 15, &quot;Automotive Business Review&quot; magazine reported that according to statistics from the Shijiazhuang Commerce Bureau, the relocation involved 177 sizable 4S stores, affecting almost all 4S stores in Shijiazhuang. The notice, stamped with the bright red seals of the local Natural Resources and Planning Bureau, the Public Security Bureau, the Urban Management Bureau, the Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau, the Fire Rescue and the Subdistrict Office, requires that all 4S stores be relocated and vacated before September 30, and the stores must be closed. , those who do not move into the automobile industrial park must close their stores before September 10th; temporary and illegal 4S stores must be demolished by themselves before September 10th, otherwise they will be demolished by force; &quot;Refuse to cooperate, maliciously obstruct and hinder the execution of official duties&quot; &quot; will be &quot;seriously dealt with in accordance with the law, and those suspected of committing crimes will be held criminally responsible in accordance with the law.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, demolition work has begun, and many car brand showrooms have been razed to the ground in the Hebei International Automobile Trade Park, the largest local automobile park. According to reports, the relocation of automobile 4S stores was carried out in the name of &quot;comprehensive improvement of temporary (illegal construction) low-end market&quot;: the government requires existing 4S stores to be closed and demolished, and relocated to four new parks planned by the government. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not uncommon in various places to require companies to relocate to new parks planned by the government under various pretexts. A few years ago, a county in eastern Shandong Province required all stone companies in a town famous for stone production to relocate to a newly built &quot;stone industrial park&quot; in the name of &quot;industrial agglomeration.&quot; A few years later, on the grounds of &quot;air pollution control&quot;, all barbecue restaurants in the county were required to move to the newly built &quot;BBQ Street&quot;. If you don&#39;t want to relocate, then close without negotiation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same is true for the car 4S store in Shijiazhuang that &quot;requires time-limited relocation&quot;. Once a document is issued by the city government, the district and sub-district offices will enforce it. If they are unwilling to relocate, they will close the store and demolish it. However, the expenses and costs associated with relocation, as well as the possible impact on industrial development, need to be calculated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What impact may relocation have on companies and industries? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, of course, the renovated business premises must be abandoned and moved to a new location. Not to mention the rent, renovating is a huge expense. According to an estimate from an article by the China Automobile Dealers Association, each new store after the centralized relocation is expected to require an additional construction investment of 10 million to 20 million yuan. In recent years, car sales have dropped from their peak, especially due to the impact of the epidemic. Many dealers were already struggling to survive until the epidemic was relaxed, and they are planning to take advantage of the opportunity to develop their business. Some stores even just opened a few months ago, and were required to dismantle and relocate the store before selling a few cars. The tens of millions of yuan invested just now were in vain. It was difficult for the store owners to invest more funds in the construction of new stores, so they had to Forced into bankruptcy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some shop owners questioned the procedural issues. According to a report by Shijiazhuang Daily in June, the policy formulated at the special meeting of the Municipal Party Committee at that time was to &quot;build first and then destroy&quot;. First, ensure that the new automobile industrial park is completed and put into use by the end of September, and then complete &quot;overdue temporary construction and illegal construction&quot; in October. &quot;4S store relocation and renovation. However, in actual implementation, &quot;establish first and then destroy&quot; has become &quot;first break and then establish&quot;. According to reports, the four new parks currently planned are still under construction. Even if work is rushed 24/7, it will be difficult to complete before the end of September. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Part of the reason why Shijiazhuang City proposed the relocation and rectification of 4S stores is that some current 4S stores have problems such as &quot;extended temporary construction and illegal construction&quot; and are a &quot;low-end market&quot; that need &quot;rectification and improvement.&quot; In fact, the current automobile 4S stores in Shijiazhuang City are relatively concentrated in four parks. Some of these parks are automobile industrial parks previously planned by the government, and some are actively gathered and formed spontaneously during the market development process. The location selection of these stores was a decision made by dealers after investigating factors such as the business district environment and customer needs, and was also in line with the municipal planning at the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Requiring time-limited relocation&quot; affects not only 4S stores, but also the millions of existing car owners in Shijiazhuang, as well as new car owners who are preparing to buy cars. Officials require almost all 4S stores to close before the end of September. It is not yet known when the new park will be completed. Even if the new park is built, and even if the 4S store has the money to relocate, the decoration of the new store will usually take at least two to three months. There will be a window of several months in between. During this period, let alone citizens being unable to buy new cars, it is even difficult to ensure vehicle maintenance and repairs for old car owners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2023, the central government issued the &quot;31 Articles on the Private Economy&quot;, which requires optimizing the development environment of the private economy, protecting the property rights of private enterprises and the rights and interests of entrepreneurs in accordance with the law, and promoting the development and growth of the private economy. The Hebei Province Private Economy Leading Group also announced the &quot;Hebei Province Private Economy Development Work Points in 2023&quot; in April 2023, proposing to continue to optimize the business environment. As for optimizing the business environment, the most fundamental thing is probably not to provide enterprises with various industrial guidance and policy preferences, but to reduce interference in the market, respect the property rights of enterprises and the autonomy of entrepreneurs, and allow entrepreneurs to make market decisions independently. Only with more services and less guidance, more support and less trouble can the private economy develop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[证监会再出“新招”规范上市公司分红强化制度约束和激励]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256974]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-20 11:30:49&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;It is the common wish of investors to obtain higher dividends within a reasonable range. On September 18, a reporter from 21st Century Business Herald learned that the China Securities Regulatory Commission plans to launch a series of measures to improve the normalized dividend mechanism for listed companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, the China Securities Regulatory Commission has introduced and implemented a &quot;linking&quot; policy between dividends and shareholding reductions. Listed companies have not distributed cash dividends in the past three years, or the cumulative cash dividend amount is less than 30% of the average annual net profit in the past three years. , controlling shareholders and actual controllers are not allowed to reduce their holdings of the company’s shares through the secondary market. According to the person in charge of the relevant department of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, it is planned to further strengthen institutional constraints on companies that do not pay dividends or pay small dividends to urge dividends, promote the optimization of dividend methods and rhythm, so that companies that pay dividends can get more incentives, and at the same time, strengthen the supervision of companies that exceed their ability to pay dividends. constraints, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that the amount of dividends paid and the proportion of A-share companies ranked among the top in the world. Data show that in the past five years, the amount of dividends paid by A-share listed companies has increased year by year, with a cumulative dividend of 8.2 trillion yuan, and the amount of dividends has exceeded the amount of financing that year. In 2022, a total of 3,291 Shanghai and Shenzhen listed companies in my country&#39;s domestic market paid cash dividends, accounting for 67.1% of the total number of listed companies at the end of 2022. The total cash dividends for the year reached 2.06 trillion yuan, of which the amount of dividends attributed to A-share shareholders was 1.62 Trillion yuan. From an international comparison, the number of dividend-paying listed companies in the domestic market ranks first among the world&#39;s major securities markets, the total amount of cash dividends ranks second in the world, and the proportion of dividend-paying companies ranks second in the world. In addition, 163 listed companies announced cash dividend plans for their 2023 semi-annual reports, with dividends expected to be 203.01 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/4cc2cabe70cda1d4f140901286cc0992.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;675&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/4cc2cabe70cda1d4f140901286cc0992.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251172&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;h4>;Mature companies with continuous improvement in dividends, and companies listed on the main board have a higher proportion of dividends&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In recent years, the sustainability and growth of dividends of listed companies in my country have continued to improve. Data shows that as of 2022, the proportion of companies that have paid dividends for five consecutive years has increased from 20% ten years ago to 48%, and the proportion of companies that have paid dividends for 10 consecutive years has increased from 8% to 31%; 412 listed companies have paid dividends continuously. The proportion of companies that have grown in three years has increased from 3% ten years ago to 12%, and the proportion of companies that have grown in five consecutive years has increased from 1% to 4%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dividend yield and dividend payout ratio also show a fluctuating upward trend. The dividend yield distribution range has gradually increased from 0.5%-1.5% before 2010 to the current 1.5%-2%. In 2022, the average dividend payout rate in my country&#39;s domestic market is 32.5%, and the average dividend rate is 1.97%, which is in the middle and upper reaches of major global markets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Which sectors and industries pay higher dividends? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Industry insiders believe that dividend features are generally in line with the company’s development stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of sectors, the dividend payout rate of main board companies is the highest, reaching about 33%, which is 8 percentage points higher than the Science and Technology Innovation Board and GEM. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of industries, industries with stable performance and low investment demand tend to have higher dividend ratios. Judging from the average dividend payout ratio, energy, major consumption, and public utilities rank among the top three, with dividend ratios as high as 50%, 48%, and 45% respectively. Listed companies in these industries have low new investment needs and relatively stable cash flow. Hence the average dividend payout level is higher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the contrary, the real estate, industry, and information technology industries have greater investment demand, and the average dividend payout ratio is also lower, at 28%, 26%, and 25% respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the dividend level of A-share companies in the start-up and growth stages is lower than that of companies in the mature stage. Due to their relatively weak financing capabilities and strong willingness to save and defend, private enterprises have slightly lower dividend levels than state-owned enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Whether a high proportion of dividends is reasonable or not needs to be viewed comprehensively and accurately&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Dividends of listed companies need to comprehensively consider multiple factors such as profitability, cash flow, debt, growth stage, development goals, etc. Different types of The attitudes and demands of shareholders towards cash dividends are not completely consistent, and it is necessary to balance the interests of the company and shareholders, major shareholders and small shareholders.&quot; The interviewed experts believe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the opinion of this expert, whether a company can pay dividends and how much it pays are mainly affected by three factors: first, the undistributed profits accumulated by the company from its operations in the current year and in the past; second, the cash it currently has; It is whether the retained earnings can meet the company&#39;s future development needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The dividend ratio needs to be determined comprehensively based on the company&#39;s profitability, development stage, and future development needs. According to industry insiders, whether a company pays dividends and how much it pays are not necessarily linked to the profit of the year. Although the dividend ratio of some companies in individual years is relatively high, it is still reasonable. This must be comprehensively analyzed and viewed accurately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, some companies have stable profits and cash flow and have little investment demand, so they maintain a high dividend payout ratio. On the other hand, some companies will keep the amount of dividends unchanged despite declining profits or losses, and stabilize investor expectations through continued dividend payments, which will lead to higher dividend payout ratios in certain years. At the same time, in order to reduce redundant funds, some companies will implement special dividends based on accumulated undistributed profits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Experts interviewed believe that, of course, it is not ruled out that major shareholders may distribute dividends arbitrarily and hollow out the company regardless of the company&#39;s future development needs. This should be strengthened, but this should be a very small number. To judge whether dividends are reasonable, we need to start from three dimensions: first, we need to see whether the profits are real and whether there is fraud; secondly, we need to see where the cash comes from and whether it is borrowed money to distribute dividends; finally, we must make a comprehensive judgment based on the motivation of major shareholders to pay dividends. A high proportion of dividends cannot be equated with dividends beyond capacity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Therefore, we need to view high-proportion dividends comprehensively and accurately. On the one hand, we must identify dividends based on false profits at the expense of the interests of listed companies; on the other hand, we welcome dividends based on the company’s true profit level and development needs. A high proportion of dividends that can effectively return investors.&quot; said an industry insider. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Four aspects will be followed to further standardize dividends of listed companies&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Recently, the China Securities Regulatory Commission plans to review the &quot;Supervisory Guidelines for Listed Companies No. 3 - Cash Dividends of Listed Companies&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Dividend Guidelines&quot;) ) &quot;Guidelines on Articles of Association of Listed Companies&quot; (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Guidelines on Articles of Association&quot;) and other rules have been revised. On the basis of the &quot;linking policy&quot; for dividends and shareholding reductions that have been introduced in the early stage, we will continue to improve and optimize the cash dividend supervision system and strengthen information disclosure supervision. , conveniently optimize the mid-term dividend payment process, better play the role of investment side, and continue to enhance investors’ sense of gain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the head of the relevant department of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, this policy adjustment will proceed from four aspects:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, strengthen institutional constraints and urge companies to pay dividends that do not pay dividends or pay small dividends. The first is to strengthen information disclosure supervision. For companies listed on the main board that do not pay a certain proportion of dividends, they are required to disclose and explain the reasons. The second is to strengthen disclosure requirements for companies with large financial investments, and urge companies to improve the efficiency of asset use and better focus on the main business and return investors. The third is to strengthen inquiries and supervisory interviews. Strengthen regulatory inquiries to help investors make better judgments on dividend information, and urge more dividends through interviews and other methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, promote further optimization of dividend methods and rhythm. Specific measures in this regard can be summarized in two points: First, simplify the mid-term dividend payment procedures to facilitate the company to further increase the frequency of dividends and allow investors to better plan capital arrangements. Second, guide the company to formulate a dividend policy for stable growth. Promote companies to amend their articles of association to improve the operability of dividend policies; guide companies to explore dividend distribution policies with stable growth and reward investors with more stable dividends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, let companies with good dividends receive more rewards and &quot;taste the sweetness.&quot; On the one hand, it gives more &quot;honor&quot; to companies that pay good dividends. The exchange will study how to further favor high dividend-paying companies in the evaluation of information disclosure; the Listed Companies Association will study and optimize the preparation method of listed companies&#39; dividend lists and increase publicity efforts to guide companies to establish a correct value orientation. On the other hand, promote the development of more influential dividend index products; encourage fund companies to issue dividend fund products, and guide market funds to increase their preference for cash dividends from listed companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, strengthen restrictions on companies that pay dividends beyond their capabilities. Although paying dividends beyond capacity is not a prominent problem in A-shares, the China Securities Regulatory Commission will still pay close attention to it and take multiple measures to strengthen prevention. The first is to work hard to ensure that the company&#39;s performance is true and the basis for dividends is solid, and to effectively prevent listed companies from falsifying their finances and financing dividends. Second, for listed companies that have high asset-liability ratios and insufficient operating cash flow, but continue to pay dividends at a high proportion, detailed disclosure of the rationality of the dividend plan and its impact on the company&#39;s production and operations is required. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 11:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[当“杀猪盘”受害者决定复仇]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256936]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-20 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/18/7r1sWaprdhm6KsLiuHJndtO0Uye3iXJ0D57PCasl.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;655&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/7r1sWaprdhm6KsLiuHJndtO0Uye3iXJ0D5 7PCasl. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251122&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The story of &quot;Parrot Killing&quot; is inspired by a large number of real cases of &quot;Pig Killing Plate&quot;. Zhou Ran, played by Zhou Dongyu, decided to take revenge after being defrauded of 550,000 yuan. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When we met for the first time, Zhou Dongyu asked Ma Yingxin in a joking tone, what do you think about me? Like a person who has been cheated? It was September 2021, not long after Ma Yingxin returned to China. In the first week after arriving in Beijing, she had a meal with Zhou Dongyu and talked about Zhou Ran, the heroine of &quot;Parrot Killing&quot;, a victim of emotional fraud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Yingxin felt that the real intention in the witty words was that she thought the audience would not be convinced if she played a deceived person. Ma Yingxin’s answer: When you think you will not be cheated, you are basically increasing your chances of being cheated. After hearing this, Zhou Dongyu did not refute or admit, &quot;But she did go back and think about it for two days and said, let me play this role.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;I believe that after the movie is released, the first reaction of the audience will be, will Dong Yu be deceived?&quot; Ma Yingxin told the Southern Weekend reporter, but this was precisely one of the reasons why she chose Zhou Dongyu. &quot;I don&#39;t want to choose someone who everyone will think will be deceived when they see her. Then she acted in this story. I don&#39;t think she conveyed anything. It&#39;s precisely Dong Yu who is like this. Maybe in the audience&#39;s perception, they don&#39;t believe her. If you will be deceived, then it will be more interesting for us to read this story.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was early autumn in Beijing in September. In an office building near the China World Trade Center, Ma Yingxin wore a black knitted sweater and pushed Wearing a wheelchair, he entered the conference room neatly. After a car accident when she was young, she has been using a wheelchair. Stopping in front of the long white table, she did not say any greetings and only said softly, &quot;Let&#39;s get started.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The creation of &quot;Parrot Killing&quot; is based on a large number of real cases. The background of the story is the emotional scam in telecommunications network fraud, commonly known as &quot;Pig Killing Plate&quot;. After 2019, Ma Yingxin began to receive relevant news frequently. What puzzled her was that mainstream comments were belittling and blaming the victimized women. They were &quot;love-brained,&quot; &quot;stupid,&quot; and even the word &quot;pig-killing plate&quot; itself was a stigma. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Many people, without thinking deeply about this problem, think how could I be deceived. But in fact, so many people have been deceived.&quot; When writing the script, in addition to online information, Ma Yingxin also Ask a friend to find the real victim and chat. She discovered that there were many more victims than she thought, and many of them were very smart and outstanding people. Emotional deception is different from ordinary financial fraud. The victim will feel humiliated and dare not tell others. Some people do not even call the police. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Emotional fraud usually refers to online fraud that induces victims to make &quot;investments&quot; based on opposite-sex online dating. The long-term process of establishing an emotional relationship is called &quot;pig farming.&quot; In recent years, as more information has been disclosed, people have discovered that the means of emotional fraud are highly specialized and even involve psychological knowledge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A woman working in the financial industry in a big city in China also had doubts when communicating with scammers. The other party claimed to be a colleague. She asked some questions about the industry intentionally or unintentionally, and the other party could answer them appropriately. After being deceived, the woman did not tell her family, and only a few friends vaguely knew about it. She worries that if her colleagues find out, what she says in the company will have no weight in the future. When talking to Ma Yingxin, she always used a relatively relaxed tone, &quot;I thought everyone had passed the financial test, so there should be no problem.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2020, Ma Yingxin finished writing the script of &quot;Parrot Killing&quot;. The heroine Zhou Ran, played by Zhou Dongyu, is a female drifter from Beijing who was defrauded of 550,000 yuan. She followed clues to a small coastal town and met the con man Lin Zhiguang, played by Zhang Yu, and his friend Xu Zhao, played by Zhang Youhao. Emotional deception is based on imitation, performance, manipulation, and insight into and gaming of the subtleties of the human heart. Zhou Ran decided to retaliate in his own way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The filming location of the movie was Dongshan Island in Zhangzhou, Fujian. Maying hoped to find an island filled with fog. When writing the script, the first thing that came to her mind was the scene of three people meeting in the fog. She thought that this scene was like the state of a deceived woman - &quot;She was in the fog and couldn&#39;t see anything, but a male voice kept coming. She had been in a heavy fog for nine months.&quot; Until the source of the voice came out of the fog and a specific image of a man appeared, the fog began to disperse. &quot;From this moment on, Zhou Ran saw some things clearly. She wanted to take action. Finally, she was not in a place shrouded in fog and without anything. A situation that cannot be caught. I see you clearly, but you don’t know my situation or my mentality. She took the initiative.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1986, Ma Yingxin was born in Northeast China. She has loved watching movies since she was a child. After online paid movies became available, her father paid two to three thousand yuan in internet fees in one month. As an adult, Ma Yingxin went to Spain to study and study law, where she lived for more than ten years. She likes Almodóvar, has been writing scripts for the past ten years, and has made short films &quot;Dead Words&quot; and &quot;Man in the Chair&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Parrot Killing&quot; is Ma Yingxin&#39;s first feature film. As a new director living overseas, this project was set up by accident. A few years ago, she met the writer Shuang Xuetao at a literature lecture in Spain. She introduced that she was engaged in film work in Spain and also wrote scripts. Shuang Xuetao said, if you want to hear other people&#39;s opinions, you are welcome to send them to me. At the end of 2020, after writing the script of &quot;Parrot Killing&quot;, she sent it to Shuang Xuetao on WeChat, &quot;I said that we exchanged WeChat messages when you came to Spain two years ago. Who am I? At that time, you said that you could give the script to Look, I now have a story that happened in China.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two days later, they had a long phone call. Shuang Xuetao was on the sidelines preparing to play football at the time, but did not play until the end of the game. &quot;We didn&#39;t talk too much about the script on that phone call. He was actually trying to find out if I could be a director.&quot; Later, Shuang Xuetao became the producer of &quot;Parrot Killing&quot;, and Don He, who had collaborated with &quot;Fire on the Plain&quot;, served as the producer. Producer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the one-and-a-half-hour interview, Ma Yingxin occasionally needed to put her hands on the armrests of her wheelchair and lift her body to relax. Before becoming a director, she may face some labels, &quot;maybe a woman, followed by my personal physical condition&quot;, which she can accept, but in the final analysis, she wants to introduce herself as: an honest creator. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The title of &quot;Parrot Killing&quot; partly comes from parroting. The liar uses parroting techniques to help teach and complete the deception, which is essentially an act of imitation. She wanted to express, &quot;Women&#39;s appreciation of emotions is not a disadvantage of women, or something that should be eliminated.&quot; This is part of being a woman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/TFzP0fFlVRzfYq5kgKfXAqrgeekK3vc1pDTRhA5l.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/TFzP0fFlVRzfYq5kgKfXAqrgeekK3vc1pDTRhA5l.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251123&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Director Ma Yingxin was born in Northeast China in 1986 and has lived overseas for many years. &quot;Parrot Killing&quot; is her first feature film. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;These women are ordinary people&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;,&lt;/strong>; strong>;&lt;strong>;Very smart, even outstanding&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot; >;You once said that you would not make a movie based on a certain social issue, but rather that a certain issue fits the issue you want to discuss and use this issue to develop a story. You think &quot;Pig Killing Plate&quot; is very much like a fable. What does it contain to you? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Yingxin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When I was watching the news about &quot;Pig Killing Plate&quot;, the comments below kept discussing that the victim was stupid and must be It’s some very stupid, love-minded women who get scammed. After seeing these words, I have doubts based on my understanding of people. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think it is impossible for a person not to have emotional connections with people in this life. It is not only limited to emotional love relationships, but also has emotional and trusting connections with your friends and people around you. . If this is the case, a group of people come here, and they are deliberately trying to deceive you. What can you do? It has nothing to do with whether you are a smart person, unless you don&#39;t relate to people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, I tried to find out what kind of people the victims were. I read online information and asked friends to contact me. I came to the conclusion that these people were ordinary women, just like me and the people around me. Nothing is different, have normal expectations for life and love. They are very smart, even brilliant women. So I&#39;m not going to create a typical or any kind of spectacle victim image. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, regarding why people are deceived, I had a communication with the producer Shuang Xuetao. He said that liars are an ancient industry, and cheating with feelings has been happening since ancient times. , but in a different form today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The process of being deceived involves many essential human issues, such as people’s eternal desire for true love, and the use of emotions to manipulate, deceive, and game between people. This is a very tense relationship. , which is theatrically intense. So this story has two levels. One is that the &quot;pig killing plate&quot; itself is an unfair or biased impression of the female victims, and the other is that this issue also contains other more essential issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You start from the emotional state and inner struggle of the victim after being deceived. , was this perspective formed from the beginning? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Yingxin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I spent half a year to a year thinking about the script. I feel that the creation is not a complete representation of reality, and I don’t want to film it. I have so many news materials in my hands and then put them together in the form of a movie. Movies need to have a structure that puts in the things you most want to discuss. Later, I started writing the script after having two relatively clear ideas. One was that I wanted the victim and the liar to meet in reality, and the second was that I wanted to reenact the process of cheating and being cheated. I wrote it on and off for about half a year. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xue Tao is very interested in many liar movies. He feels that this movie is a subversion of liar movies, because they usually focus on liars and describe how powerful liars are. How clever. He said that you did it from the perspective of a victim, which kept the genre of the con man movie and was subversive at the same time. In addition, he also said that liars have existed since ancient times, including big liars, small liars, and industry liars, so this is also a movie about trust. From both perspectives, this issue is worth pursuing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also, he said that I provided a female perspective, because if a man were to make this movie, it might turn out differently. Don He has worked with female directors before and feels that this is a female expression, which is very precious and should be expressed like this. As a male, he could not understand every expression in it very accurately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/JVyo3c1SdHHQFzQ7hQcrX0dpZ8yTatBMEE5bHG7G.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/JVyo3c1SdHHQFzQ7hQcrX0dpZ8yTatBMEE5bHG7G.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251124&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The two male protagonists in the story are engaged in &quot;pig killing&quot; in a fraud park, and their true identities are confusing. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Don&#39;t think this movie is going to teach women a lesson&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why did you choose Zhou Dongyu to play Zhou Ran? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Yingxin: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After we promoted this project, the first thing we considered was who would play Zhou Ran, because it depends on an actress. Get up drama. At that time Don He recommended Dong Yu because they had collaborated on &quot;Fire on the Plains&quot;. Frankly speaking, I was hesitant at the time. Of course Dong Yu is very good, but in my heart I am a girl, and I think this character is exactly the opposite of her screen image. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, &quot;Fire on the Plains&quot; was shown to friends and family, and I went to see it. In the first half of the movie, Dongyu was still a girl, but in the second half, she showed another state. . Another more important reason is that I found that Dong Yu can handle very complex emotions, which is a very rare ability, because Zhou Ran has to constantly deal with complex emotions, not a simple &quot;I want revenge&quot; character. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How do you understand the complexity of the character Zhou Ran? There are a lot of undercurrents and real and fake games in this story. Do you think she ever hesitated? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Yingxin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think her determination for revenge started from the moment she met the liar, even before she met the liar. Yes, but it was after she met the liar that she decided how to take revenge. Because this liar walked up to her and said, I am sincere, how many difficulties I have, what a special person you are, and he is still using words at this moment. She may have wanted to put him in jail before, and wanted to catch him, but after that scene, something deeper was aroused. She felt that just letting him go to jail was not enough, so she adopted a series of subsequent methods. Including the voices she heard from other female victims in the car, it also gave her a lot of strength and she must do this. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But you said whether she swayed and struggled during the process, I think she did. Because she is an ordinary person, not a well-trained liar, her doing this is beyond the scope of what ordinary people can bear. If she didn&#39;t struggle, it was a revenge, I came to act a scene, without any emotional fluctuations, and finally sent you in, it was not so powerful for me. On the contrary, she struggled a little bit and finally completed it, which I think is a very powerful act. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Through the perspective of female victims, the expression you ultimately want to point to What is it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Yingxin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think we can understand the common experiences of women and the common intellectual and emotional struggles through the experience of this victim. Especially in recent years, with the emergence of the so-called &quot;love brain&quot;, I feel that it has been dwarfing women&#39;s natural appreciation of emotions, and has obscured the real problem in such an incident, which is the use of Those who seek benefits based on emotions are at fault, or this is what society really needs to be vigilant about. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not actually the core of this movie, but my own idea is that I hope that we can at least make a movie with a female protagonist. When the audience walks out of the cinema, they don’t just feel This movie wants to teach women a lesson about how women should not do anything. In the very few screenings we had before, female viewers could understand her way of revenge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/Uy98gxa2ZovcOK2j2PSY9puf61TbDG6IEi7wbK7s.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;628&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/Uy98gxa2ZovcOK2j2PSY9puf61TbDG6IEi7wbK7s.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251125&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Ma Yingxin believes that the &quot;Pig Killing Plate&quot; is a fable that contains more essential issues such as trust and emotion. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;What is sincerity?

How did it feel to work with Zhang Yu this time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Yingxin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Of course, the role of Lin Chiguang is very different from his previous screen image, such as in &quot;The Calm&quot; and &quot;Siberian Tiger&quot; In it, he is a reserved, restrained and even repressed character, or another very reckless, direct, and fierce character. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Zhiguang is completely different. He is a person who thinks very, very much. He is constantly performing true and false performances. He is very good at using language to manipulate others and use language to game or deceive others. The same thing is that Zhang Yu himself is also a very good thinker. At that time, he read the script and found it very interesting, but at the same time he had some opinions, so he wrote a page and sent it to Don He. A screenshot of the Don River was sent to me. When I saw it, I was very unconvinced and asked why you had so many opinions. So I wrote him a letter to answer these questions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think Zhang Yu is such an actor. He has a lot of questions to ask you, but after getting the answers, he can communicate and he will be very happy. Moreover, Lin Zhiguang has a relatively gentle trait in dealing with people. This is also something Zhang Yu himself has. He is also a very gentle person. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What was written on that piece of paper? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Yingxin: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;For example, why should I kill an octopus? Is this directed at me? What is the purpose of this image? I say that movies should not explain things. The more you explain, the less things you will learn. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Did he himself create anything for this character? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Yingxin: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The language he created most is Lin Zhiguang’s language. We have fought many times about this matter. He wants Lin Zhiguang to have A very soft, Southern and not-so-Southern accent. This character deceived people and said that he was in Southeast Asia. He should have a unique accent, not Zhang Yu&#39;s accent, and not a Mandarin speaker. This was something he felt was very important to this character. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Your image of these two male scammers How do you understand it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Yingxin: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Lin Zhiguang is a person who does not believe in anything. He plays Achang online and Lin Zhiguang in life, so he basically He is a person who lives in acting. He is very good at manipulating others and emotions. He is an empty, helpless and hesitant person. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Zhao is a ruined person. He arrived at that place relatively young. He has no understanding of all this and starts doing these things in order to survive. He has not really experienced what love is and what sincerity is, and he is already using it to deceive others, which leads to him being in a very chaotic state. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So in reality when he faced Zhou Ran and a real woman, he was actually very confused and couldn&#39;t tell whether he loved her or cherished her. Lin Zhiguang has a line that says, I thought you really liked her. He said I really like her, you said it, you have to be sincere. But what exactly is this sincerity? I don&#39;t think he knows either. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/8sZtRFcVewUDgJd1gypnAc9MpeOf7XbGV0wxcK8Z.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/8sZtRFcVewUDgJd1gypnAc9MpeOf7XbGV0wxcK8Z.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251126&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Ma Yingxin was at the shooting scene. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Women’s way of revenge is unique&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;, &lt; /strong>;&lt;strong>;Powerful&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Zhou Ran The scene where he and Lin Zhiguang were kissing in the car was not a very direct kissing scene, it was even a bit like a &quot;borrowed position&quot;.

I don’t think Lin Zhiguang fell in love with Zhou Ran in such a short period of time. , especially for a person like Lin Zhiguang, it is almost impossible. I think that at that moment he was delusional about this woman being able to forgive him and possibly even build a future life with him. Even though he was a liar, he had a moment of delusion and returned to this carriage. There&#39;s also the possibility that he needed to get back to the car to get the money. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那场戏冬雨处理得也非常复杂，我几乎不太愿意用语言解读那场戏，但我核心的认识是最后的对峙，冬雨的表演非常有力量，她甚至做了一个鬼脸。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;那是她自己加的反应？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;麻赢心：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;对，她在那一刻突然有那一个动作，我认为是一个非常强大的反应，而且是只有她会给的一个反应。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;对于你来说，周冉最终的复仇是一种女性主义表达吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;麻赢心：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我觉得我在这部电影里非常诚实，我本身是一个女性，所以一定是女性的表达，但是它是不是女性主义的表达，坦白说女性主义我还在学习。但这部电影至少提出了一种女性看待事情的方式，和她行动的方法。提到复仇，你总会觉得它是一种暴力行为，因为由复仇带来的联想，之前是由男性电影或以男性为主导的电影来给人建立印象的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我觉得这是一个新的印象，女性复仇的方式是独特的。如果你认同情感或者谎言能给人伤害，那她复仇的方式就是有力的。确实有一些观众会觉得是不是不够爽，期待一些更暴力或更剧烈的复仇方式。但对我而言，反而这种方式才是真正有力的，而不是更暴烈、更外化的东西，我觉得她真的用了一个人是如何被摧毁的方式去报仇或回应。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;那你觉得林致光体会到了这种伤害，或者接收到了这个信息吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;麻赢心：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我觉得林致光至少是诧异的，是他意想不到的。至少从表演上来说，最后那一场戏章宇的角色非常用力地看周冉，他就是想要看到一些答案，但是他看不到。我认为至少这个问题会困扰他。而且除了被绳之以法，对过去做的事情，他可能有机会真正地反思。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[211高校女硕士遭杀猪盘被骗138万：财务决策与婚恋决策分开是防骗关键]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256938]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-20 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, &quot;211 female master&#39;s degree was defrauded of 1.38 million in two weeks&quot; became the first hot search topic . The client, Xueer, joined a bank in Shanghai after graduating from a 211 college in Jiangsu with a master&#39;s degree. In May and June this year, she posted about choosing a spouse on a social platform. A man took the initiative to contact her, saying that he lived in Wujia Plaza, Yangpu District, Shanghai, graduated from Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, worked in a major Internet company, and was on a business trip in Beijing. After communicating online for a period of time, the other party sent Xueer a link and asked her to click to download an app called &quot;luno&quot; and teach her to buy coins on it, and then use the coins to buy up and down to earn some extra money. At first, Xueer made some money. Later, the other party asked Xueer to invest more than 1.3 million yuan for various reasons. In the end, Xueer found out that she had fallen into a scam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The endless emergence of &quot;pig-killing plates&quot;, killing all kinds of people, naked chat traps for men, and marriage and love traps for women show that scammers have a precise grasp of the psychological differences between the sexes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although they have high education, high income, and good looks, many women are also trapped in it. The reason is that some highly educated women often fail to make good financial decisions and marriage decisions during marriage, especially when they mix them up, giving scammers an opportunity to take advantage of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called financial decision-making involves financial expenditure, investment and other behaviors. It is necessary to comprehensively consider the reasonable feasibility of the investment project, investment scale, investment stop-loss standards, and the consequences of investment failure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;pig-killing plate&quot; cash-out routine often uses high interest rates to induce victims. However, what you want is high interest rates, and scammers are targeting your principal.人们应建立一个投资常识，投资产品的预期收益与投资风险是正相关的。 Just like the daily purchase of various financial products, financial products will be marked with different grades. Financial products with low expected annualized yields but marked with low risk mainly invest in high-credit-rated bonds (such as treasury bonds), money market and other low-risk financial products. , and financial products with high expected annualized returns but marked with medium and high risks will have a high proportion of high-volatility financial products such as stocks, commodities, and foreign exchange in the investment product portfolio. When customers purchase products, financial management institutions also conduct personal investment risk assessments and recommend investment varieties that are more in line with their risk preferences based on past investment categories, income status and other information reported by them to avoid blind investments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, when the woman hears the other party introducing investment products that &quot;guarantee no loss and interest rates far exceed the market average&quot;, she should be alert. Guo Shuqing once reminded the majority of financial consumers and investors: high returns mean high risks. If the return rate exceeds 6%, there will be a question mark. If the return rate exceeds 8%, it will be very dangerous. If the return rate exceeds 10%, you will be prepared to lose all your principal. In addition, do not trust unknown information, do not disclose personal information at will, do not open unknown network links, and do not transfer money easily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whenever you encounter a large amount of capital investment, learn more about investment and financial management expertise in advance, or ask people or institutions with relevant experience to provide advice, and then make investment and investment decisions based on your own risk tolerance, funding level, etc. Decisions on whether, the amount of investment, and how to stop losses promptly when problems arise should become the &quot;financial intelligence&quot; possessed by everyone. Especially as highly educated women, they should have minimum learning ability. Xueer in the above case works in a bank. Although she is engaged in IT work, it is not difficult to find a few colleagues who understand financial management for advice. However, she was deceived by her husband, especially the initial profit from &quot;investment&quot;, and stepped deeper into the trap. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, men and women also need to make good decisions about marriage and love. Generally speaking, in the marriage and love market, men and women have different demands. Men tend to pay more attention to women&#39;s appearance, age, etc., while women focus on men&#39;s wealth, family background and other criteria. For Kochi women, there are many men who are excellent in certain aspects in the marriage and love market, but there are very few rich men. The tall, rich and handsome people with both appearance and wealth are a typical scarce group. Their choice space is huge, so they are interested in the &quot;rich and handsome&quot;. The competition for &quot;handsome&quot; is actually very fierce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why scammers create rich and handsome characters is that they know that this group of people is in a seller&#39;s market, and women are often hard to find. Once they meet, some women are eager to capture Prince Charming tightly, have a serious dependence mentality, and are prone to obey the tricks of scammers. Some women are too pursuing the perfection of love and high returns on investment, and ignore the risks and uncertainties in reality. When faced with the &quot;Pig Killing Plate&quot; scam, he was tempted by emotions and interests, and fell into the scammer&#39;s trap, ultimately losing both his life and money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether you are a man or a woman, when making a marriage decision, you must make at least three prior assessments: First, objectively evaluate your own conditions. What is your approximate ranking in the marriage market? Don’t just think about winning five million by buying a lottery ticket for two yuan. He who knows others is wise, and he who knows himself is wise. The ancients are honest and do not deceive me. Secondly, if the other person&#39;s words, deeds and person make you feel comfortable, like bathing in the spring breeze, then don&#39;t be too proud. You should blow a cold breeze and judge rationally. Is this the other person&#39;s character or is he always catering to you? It&#39;s understandable to covet emotional value, but the price the other party secretly bids may be too expensive for you to bear. Third, even if you decide that the other person is the right one, don’t tie your marriage and love decisions to your financial decisions. More and more men and women who have reached the stage of marriage are beginning to emphasize the &quot;AA system&quot; of property and living expenses after marriage. How can you give your hard-earned money to the other party to help invest before marriage? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 10:25:34 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[澳门街坊的横琴生活：粤澳合作区两周年记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256972]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-20 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/19/3IlYVTST4u7boDGwr3CZwE7hFkzeXhdwCKSbR0bN.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;606&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/3IlYVTST4u7boDGwr3CZwE7hFkzeXhdw CKSbR0bN. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251169&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At dawn, accompanied by the crisp prompts when passengers cleared customs, the new passenger inspection building standing at Hengqin Port once again ushered in a busy moment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every day, about 12,000 Hong Kong and Macao residents travel between Hengqin and Macao through the Hengqin Port. Macao resident Huang Huixia is one of them. Almost two years ago, she moved to the Guangdong-Macao Deep Cooperation Zone in Hengqin and became a &quot;new Hengqin native&quot;; now, she lives in Hengqin and returns to Macau three or four times a week. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The transportation is more convenient, the house is more spacious, the living environment is more comfortable, the community services are better, and more and more Macao people come to the cooperation zone...” Talking about the two projects in Hengqin Huang Huixia has a treasure trove of her life experiences over the years. In the future, as the Macau light rail extension Hengqin Line project comes into use, the transportation from Hengqin to Macau will become more convenient. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 5, 2021, the &quot;Overall Plan for the Construction of the Hengqin Guangdong-Macao Deep Cooperation Zone&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Hengqin Plan&quot;) was issued, giving Hengqin &quot;a new platform to promote the moderately diversified development of Macao&#39;s economy&quot; It has four major strategic missions: &quot;a new space to facilitate the life and employment of Macao residents&quot;, &quot;a new demonstration to enrich the practice of &#39;one country, two systems&#39;&quot; and &quot;a new highland to promote the construction of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area&quot;. Twelve days later, the management agency of the Hengqin Guangdong-Macao Deep Cooperation Zone was officially unveiled, and the construction of the cooperation zone has entered the &quot;fast lane&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Since the issuance of the &quot;Hengqin Master Development Plan&quot; in 2009, the country has successively introduced a series of innovative policies to draw a bright blueprint for the development of Hengqin.&quot; Dean of the Institute of Regional Opening and Cooperation at Sun Yat-sen University Mao Yanhua told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;The Hengqin Guangdong-Macao Deep Cooperation Zone has multiple advantages such as superior location conditions, solid cooperation foundation, and strong support. The current development momentum is strong, and the future will definitely be more promising.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; h4>;&lt;strong>;Macao Neighbors in Hengqin&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“My original house in Macao was very small, only about 60 square meters. After moving to Hengqin, the living area suddenly increased. 150 square meters.&quot; After two years of moving to Hengqin, Huang Huixia has the most vivid feelings about the changes in Hengqin&#39;s living environment, transportation conditions, community services, medical care, and customs clearance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In early autumn, the water of Tianmu River is shining, with green trees and lush vegetation on both sides. Strolling along the 7.2-kilometer-long ecological corridor along the river, rhythmic urban waterfront landscape belts such as ecological community areas and park-like communities gradually unfold, and across the water are the Macau Tower and the Grand Lisboa Tower. , MGM Hotel and other Macau landmark buildings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huang Huixia moved to Hengqin Shangcun from Macau two years ago, where 60% of the residents are Macau residents. Shangcun is only about ten minutes&#39; walk from Tianmu River. In her free time every day, she would go for a walk by the river. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huang Huixia still clearly remembers the situation when she first moved to Hengqin. At that time, due to insufficient flow of people and few bus lines, it took a long time to go back to Macau. &quot;Now I travel to and from Macau three or four times a week. There are several buses to Hengqin Port after leaving the community.&quot; Huang Huixia told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hengqin Port is located on the west bank of the Cross Gate Waterway on Hengqin Island and is connected to the Macau Bridge. It is at the intersection of &quot;one country, two systems&quot; and the junction of &quot;internal and external radiation&quot;. At present, Hengqin Port has achieved &quot;cooperative inspection and one-time release&quot;. Entry-exit personnel only need to &quot;stand in the same hall, line up once, and undergo inspection once&quot; to complete the entry-exit procedures for both the mainland and Macao. The average customs clearance time per person is only 30 About seconds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The customs clearance time has been greatly shortened and the process has been optimized, allowing Macao residents traveling between the two places to live a more comfortable life in the twin cities. Huang Huixia clearly feels that more and more Macao residents are passing through customs and entering the cooperation zone every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics, there are currently more than 7,000 Macao residents settling and working in Hengqin. The average daily passenger flow of Hong Kong and Macao residents entering and exiting through Hengqin Port will increase from more than 5,900 in 2022 to nearly 1.2 in 2023. Thousands of people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to major improvements in the living environment, daily life and transportation conditions, the elderly care, medical and community services in the Hengqin Cooperation Zone are also constantly moving closer to Macau standards. In 2019, the Macau Federation of Neighborhood Associations set up a service center in Hengqin and formed a professional service team to provide Macau-standard home care home care services for seniors aged 60 and over in the cooperation zone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“As of the end of August 2023, we have provided services to more than 960,000 residents in Qinzhou and Macao.” A person in charge of the Macau Neighborhood Association told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thanks to the continued advancement of the cross-border practice policy, there are currently a total of 67 short-term medical practitioners from Hong Kong and Macao practicing in Hengqin. &quot;New Hengqin residents&quot; including Huang Huixia can seek medical treatment from familiar Macao doctors without leaving the area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We can participate in local insurance in Hengqin and enjoy the same medical insurance treatment as Zhuhai citizens. It is very convenient to buy medicines and see doctors, and the personal expenses are not high.” Huang Huixia said, “Follow-up’ Macao New After the completion of the Neighborhood project, a Macau medical team will be stationed and a large medical service center will be equipped, making life more convenient in the future.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Macau New Neighborhood&quot; mentioned by Huang Huixia is a cooperation area The first comprehensive livelihood project for Macao residents, it will be equipped with various Macao standard public services and social welfare, and will create a high-quality and livable community for more than 10,000 Macao residents. Currently, the project has entered the acceptance stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Life in the cooperation zone will definitely get better and better in the future.” Huang Huixia told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Four New Industries&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Taking advantage of the rapid development of the Hengqin Cooperation Zone, Wang Ruiming came to Hengqin to seek development. In the past few months, he acquired an Australian-funded company and plans to establish a new company, mainly engaged in the financial and Internet industries, which is expected to be officially opened at the end of September. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because he is engaged in the financial industry supported by the cooperation zone, his company can enjoy a 15% tax preferential policy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Ruiming is a &quot;third generation overseas Chinese&quot;. In recent years, attracted by the business policies and environment of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, he has been actively deploying in the Bay Area and has registered financial companies in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, focusing on funds, trusts, insurance and other businesses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Hengqin’s financial industry is highly open and cross-border capital flows freely. It is the most active area for cross-border RMB settlement. Many Fortune 500 companies have settled here. It is very promising to become China’s financial industry in the future. A new highland for opening up to the outside world.&quot; Wang Ruiming told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first half of 2023, the added value of the financial industry in the cooperation zone reached 8.8 billion yuan, accounting for nearly 40% of &lt;span>;GDP&lt;/span>;, with a year-on-year growth of 2.9%, showing a trend of accelerating agglomeration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The cooperation zone has made solid progress around the &#39;Four New Industries&#39;. Not only has the industry positioning become clearer, but a system and mechanism for consultation, construction, management and sharing has also been initially established.&quot; Mao Yanhua pointed out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Macao has a small land but a large population. There are more than 680,000 people living in less than 33 square kilometers of land, with an average of more than 20,000 people per square kilometer. It is one of the cities with the highest population density in the world. Problems such as insufficient land resources and a single industrial structure have always plagued Macao&#39;s development. Hengqin, across the water from Macau, covers an area of ​​106 square kilometers and has significant spatial advantages, providing sufficient space to support the diversified development of Macau&#39;s economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as August 2009, the State Council approved the implementation of the &quot;Hengqin Master Development Plan&quot;, clearly stating that Hengqin should be used as a carrier to jointly create a cross-border cooperation innovation zone, in order to gradually change the economic structure of Macao. Single questions provide new space. With the gradual advancement of high-quality development in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the introduction of the &quot;Hengqin Plan&quot;, the integration of Hengqin and Macao has reached a new level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Since the beginning of development, Hengqin has been given the mission of serving the diversified economic development of Macao. In more than ten years of development and construction, this mission has not only remained unchanged, but has become more prominent.&quot; Mao Yanhua pointed out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since its inauguration and operation, the Hengqin Cooperation Zone has focused on the &quot;four new&quot; strategic positioning and vigorously developed the &quot;four major&quot; technological research and development and high-end manufacturing, Macao brand industries such as traditional Chinese medicine, culture, tourism, exhibition and trade, and modern financial industries. Industry&quot; and launched a series of new policies targeting the integrated circuit industry, financial industry, cultural tourism and exhibition industry, etc. In the past two years, a number of key projects have been accelerated, and the integrated development pattern of Macao and Macao has been initially established. The supporting role in promoting the moderately diversified development of Macao&#39;s economy is gradually emerging. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first half of 2023 alone, there will be more than 40 integrated circuit companies actually operating in the cooperation zone, initially forming an integrated circuit design industry ecosystem covering intellectual property (IP), third-generation semiconductors and other fields; Guangdong The Australian Cooperative Traditional Chinese Medicine Science and Technology Industrial Park contributed nearly 80 million yuan in corporate tax revenue in the first quarter, a year-on-year increase of 59%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With industrial agglomeration and policy dividends, the Hengqin Guangdong-Macao Deep Cooperation Zone has become a new platform and new highland for Australian people and enterprises to invest and start businesses. Currently, there are more than 5,600 Australian-funded enterprises in the cooperation zone, an increase of 22.3% compared with before the cooperation zone was established, and the registered capital exceeds 148 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“《横琴方案》开启了粤澳深度合作区建设的新篇章。”毛艳华表示，“未来合作区建设要继续围绕服务澳门产业多元发展这一初心，从建设一流产业功能园区出发，大力发展实体经济，利用好创新体制，进一步吸引园区内外要素充分流动集聚，从而打造珠江西岸高质量发展的新增长极。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（文中黄惠霞、王瑞明系化名）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[接连停运，有轨电车真的没“出路”吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256990]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-20 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/19/8spu9Ts8vYeI5iLwBTHBFbpnaz72rSzHzGpQrZ3O.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1267&quot; height=&quot;950&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/8spu9Ts8vYeI5iLwBTHBFbpnaz72rS zHzGpQrZ3O. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251205&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In August 2019, the Shanghai Zhangjiang tram in operation was nicknamed &quot; Dangdang car”.

On August 11, the chairman of Honghe Prefecture Modern Tram Co., Ltd. responded that the announcement was false news. At present, the local tram has not been suspended and is operating normally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July, the Tianjin Development Zone Guide Tram Line 1, which had been in operation for 16 years, announced that it would cease operation and started procurement of demolition projects. In June, Shanghai Zhangjiang Tram No. 1, which had been in operation for 13 years, was suspended and the tracks were quickly dismantled.

How to avoid the &quot;chair transport&quot; situation? Compared with subways with large passenger flows, trams are &quot;urban rail transit low-capacity systems,&quot; Li Hongchun, an expert and deputy director of the academic committee of the China Urban Rail Transit Association and vice president of the Modern Tram Branch, told Southern Weekend that doing a good job Line network planning achieves a high degree of integration of multiple transportation modes, and low-capacity systems can develop systematically and healthily. There are also many successful cases in the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Low passenger flow is the key to the suspension of trams&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Insufficient passenger flow and serious losses are the key reasons for the suspension of trams. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Jiemian News, before the suspension, the daily passenger volume of Shanghai Zhangjiang trams had dropped sharply to about 1,000 passengers.

The passenger volume that month was only 26,000, with an average of less than 900 passengers per day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/Tmq4xCmR5RV33EHVVB48glNjtPxj5yA5Jau13Uos.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height= &quot;566&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/Tmq4xCmR5RV33EHVVB48glNjtPxj5yA5Jau13Uos.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251206&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On March 29, 2018, a tram was undergoing joint debugging and testing in Honghe, Yunnan. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Low operating frequency is an important reason that affects passenger flow. The longer the departure interval, the lower the attractiveness of passenger flow. Low passenger flow further affects the departure interval, forming a vicious circle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The interval between Zhangjiang tram trains before they stop running is 15 to 20 minutes. For commuters, the waiting time is too long. &quot;Instead of waiting for the tram, it&#39;s better to buy a shared bicycle.&quot; Wang Qingfeng said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only shared bicycles, but also the opening and operation of many subway lines such as the eastern extension of Shanghai Metro Line 2, Line 11, and Line 13, have dispersed the passenger flow of trams. Before the suspension, in February 2023, Zhangjiang trams reduced their operating hours from 17 hours a day to only 4 trips during the morning and evening peak hours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shanghai Pudong Modern Rail Transit Co., Ltd. stated in the announcement that in recent years, the public transportation system in Zhangjiang area has been continuously enriched and improved. Multiple urban rail lines have been put into operation, and ground bus lines have been optimized and adjusted many times. The passenger flow of Zhangjiang Tram 1 has been declining year by year, and ground buses will replace the connection. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Insufficient technical applicability and high maintenance costs&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In addition to low passenger flow and long departure intervals, the trams in Tianjin Development Zone and Shanghai Zhangjiang are subject to The vehicles are imported products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both use the Translohr system produced by the French company Raul, which has rubber wheels, single track and a small footprint. However, not many cities around the world use this system. With the gradual decline of Raul after its acquisition, the production of related parts has been greatly reduced, resulting in high vehicle maintenance costs and long maintenance cycles, and some parts are facing the risk of &quot;supply interruption&quot;. Difficulties in purchasing parts have also led to difficulties and high costs in maintaining trams in Shanghai Zhangjiang and Tianjin Development Zone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Qingfeng recalled that when he was riding a tram in Zhangjiang, he discovered that there was a thick wooden pole in the driver&#39;s cab. The tracks are sometimes blocked by debris, and drivers need to get out of the car and use wooden poles to clear the debris, which greatly affects traffic efficiency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the Zhuhai tram, Li Hongchun mentioned in an interview that the TramWave ground power supply system it used lacked engineering practice, and the builders had insufficient understanding of the applicability of the technology, resulting in system problems after the line was opened. The failure rate is high and the operation service is unstable. At the same time, factors such as low passenger flow and high maintenance costs have directly affected the remaining section of Line 1 that was originally planned to be rebuilt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to being low in frequency, the out-of-service trams were also considered too slow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Report&quot; shows that the average travel speed of subways in 2022 will be 36.47 kilometers/hour, the average travel speed of trams nationwide is only 22.3 kilometers/hour, and the travel speed of Zhangjiang trams is only 19 kilometers/hour Hour. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the maximum design speed of Zhangjiang trams is 70 kilometers per hour. The reason for the slow running speed is that trams do not have dedicated right of way - they share the road space with all vehicles and are still subject to traffic lights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/MULPiJB1yaIIJktaDidZAsI5dHdXiQeen0UHbVz8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1079&quot; height= &quot;751&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/MULPiJB1yaIIJktaDidZAsI5dHdXiQeen0UHbVz8.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251208&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Shanghai Zhangjiang tram does not have a dedicated right of way. It shares the road space with all vehicles and is still subject to traffic lights. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Long trams waiting for traffic lights exacerbate congestion. For example, the Zhangjiang tram passes by Pudong Foreign Languages ​​School Affiliated to Shanghai International Studies University. Parents will park their private cars on the roadside when picking up their children. When the tram comes in, it will occupy the entire road. One citizen said: &quot;You can either use the non-motorized lane next to it to overtake, or you can only follow the Dangdang tram.&quot; Dangdang tram is the nickname given to Zhangjiang trams by Shanghai residents. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Planning issues, not standard issues&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Looking around the world, trams are not a niche issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;China Tram Development Report (2020)&quot; released by the Modern Tramway Branch of the China Urban Rail Transit Association shows that subways and trams are the mainstream systems of urban rail transit in the world, of which subways account for 47 %, trams account for 42%, and light rail accounts for 11%. In Europe, trams are the mainstream public transportation mode in many cities. For example, in Berlin, Germany, trams account for as high as 55.6% of the rail transit mileage. In China, this proportion is only 5.71%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some voices pointed out that the tram was &quot;unacclimated&quot; after it came to China. But Li Hongchun reminded that many tram projects are operating well. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In very large and megacities, trams can be used as extension lines and encrypted lines of large and medium-sized transportation systems such as subways. For example, Beijing&#39;s Xijiao Line, as an extension of Metro Line 10, starts from Bagou Station and connects tourist attractions such as Xiangshan Park, National Botanical Garden, Yuquan Country Park and the Summer Palace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Western Suburb Line is positioned to be “mainly for commuting, supplemented by tourism,” Li Hongchun added. The Xijiao Line is the first tramway in the country to be operated with multiple connections - two train sets are connected together to increase passenger flow. During the &quot;Xiangshan Red Leaf Festival&quot; in 2019, the maximum daily passenger flow reached 94,700, making it the first single tram in the country. The daily passenger flow is the highest recorded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/s3uq4s1bVWB4UFBFEPYKPTqk9SJPFsZy9Wmvy4UG.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;609&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/s3uq4s1bVWB4UFBFEPYKPTqk9SJPFsZy9Wmvy4UG.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251210&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;During the May Day holiday in 2022, in order to reduce the full load of the carriages, the Beijing Xijiao Line will adopt a multi-connection operation mode. A single train will change from 5 carriages to 10 carriages, with 8 groups per day. Heavy-duty trains are put into operation with a minimum departure interval of 5 minutes. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(China News Service reporter Jia Tianyong Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Huai&#39;an, Jiangsu, trams even serve as the city&#39;s backbone public transportation, ensuring Passenger flow demand. Huai&#39;an Tram Line 1 is the first tram line in China that enters the core area of ​​the city, and its passenger flow has always been at the forefront of tram lines in the country. According to the rail transit operation data of 52 cities across the country in July released by the Ministry of Transport, the passenger flow in Huai&#39;an was 580,000, reaching nearly 20,000 passengers per day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/YZuUx67kFi1vu1dBrGUZDMvEdIKHCoUO5fyNCSws.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;665&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/YZuUx67kFi1vu1dBrGUZDMvEdIKHCoUO5fyNCSws.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251211&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On March 16, 2020, in Huai&#39;an City, Jiangsu Province, modern trams that were suspended due to the epidemic resumed operation. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In tourist areas, trams can also play the role of special tourist buses, such as the Nanping Wuyi New District Line in Fujian , connecting Nanping City High-speed Railway Station to Wuyishan Station, seamlessly connecting with Wuyishan Scenic Area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the experience of successfully operating trams, unlike large-capacity systems such as subways, trams, as low-capacity systems, are redeveloped on existing road resources, which is difficult and needs to be adapted to local conditions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Hongchun believes that the suspension of some trams does not reflect problems with the tram system itself, but problems in planning and design. For example, the area near the first phase of the Zhuhai tram project is mostly high-end communities. Residents mainly travel by car. Moreover, the north side of the line is dominated by mountains. The development intensity along the line is low, there is little residential land, a lack of commercial facilities, and the line radiates from one side. , resulting in low passenger flow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to plan rationally? Li Hongchun believes that trams are positioned as an environmentally friendly transportation system that fills the gap between large-capacity subways and conventional buses. First, we must ensure a clear level of public transportation planning and strengthen integration with comprehensive transportation. For the connection of hubs, the division of labor between trams and conventional bus systems must be properly handled, and the line network layout must consider the integration of large-capacity systems and medium- and low-capacity systems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/DmwvK48RywdbQN78U7uYDMv8EtXxxxr81ofWHEj6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/DmwvK48RywdbQN78U7uYDMv8EtXxxxr81ofWHEj6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251212&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On December 26, 2020, the first tram in Wuyishan City, Nanping City, Fujian Province slowly drove out of the Xiandian depot and entered the trial operation stage. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, the Sanya tram is located closest to the entrance and exit of Sanya Railway Station, and the Jiaxing tram The station is directly connected to the newly developed campuses on both sides by pedestrian tunnels, making these designs more convenient for residents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Site selection needs to be supported by a certain population density. Li Hongchun mentioned that it is necessary to accurately predict the passenger flow in the line corridor to avoid the situation where the actual passenger flow does not reach the estimated amount. In terms of construction timing, &quot;we must first consider what needs to be built most, not where it is easier to build.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the first section of Chengdu Rong Line 2 was opened, the low passenger flow was questioned because it had not yet been connected to the urban rail network. After the opening of the second section, it was connected to the subway, and the passenger flow reached nearly four. Ten thousand people, an increase of dozens of times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of operations, regarding the issue of tram rights of way, Li Hongchun believes that priority signals should be provided for trams to ensure the safety, speed and efficiency of tram operations. For example, Huai&#39;an Tram Line 1 is equipped with three major systems: tram signal priority control system, intersection red light electronic police and road section checkpoint system, and intersection video surveillance system, and arranges traffic coordinators to realize tram priority at intersections. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Hongchun believes that under the dual influence of my country&#39;s rapid urbanization and the substantial increase in private car ownership leading to congestion, the development of public transportation is an inevitable trend in history. The construction cost of the subway is at least ten times higher than that of the tram. Compared with the bus, the tram has the advantages of large transportation capacity, high comfort and punctuality. Under the trend of carbon neutrality, tram It is an important option for public transportation construction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 08:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[哈尔滨：黄昏缄默的时候，建筑在说话]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256976]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;At 9:30 am on October 26, 1909, Congkuanchengzi (&lt;span style=&quot;font- family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Changchun&lt;/span>;) Ito Hirobumi, who arrived in Harbin by special train, stepped off the train.

Ito Hirobumi was put on a special train and died 30 minutes later. The man with a resolute face, An Zhonggen, was captured in an almost tragic manner; the seven gunshots fired over the Harbin Railway Station, which was built in 1899 and named in 1903, rapidly and profoundly changed the 20th century. The situation in Northeast Asia at the beginning - Although the train station was demolished and rebuilt in 1959, there are still vivid traces of this incident in the station, including the Ahn Jung-geun Memorial Hall and the platform where the incident occurred: the &quot;Δ&quot; and &quot;□&quot; on the ground , respectively, where Ahn Jung-geun and Ito Hirobumi are standing, about 5 meters apart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/BzUbpnhNJemtaGe2sadLVozJk7FY8TzRbmI4NHrT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;551&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/BzUbpnhNJemtaGe2sadLVozJk7FY8TzRbmI4NHrT.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251173&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Old scene of Harbin Railway Station&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Yameng/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just like Ruo Ge As Li said, &quot;When poems and legends are silent, only buildings speak.&quot; - Around the train station, everything is completely different from what it was more than a hundred years ago.

China&#39;s defeat in the Sino-Japanese War and many factors such as Tsarist Russia&#39;s use of alliance with Japan as bait to seize more interests in Northeast China gave birth to the construction of the Middle East Railway. In 1896, Russia obtained the right to build the Middle East Railway. In June of that year, Russia&#39;s Middle East Railway The General Administration of Construction moved from Vladivostok (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Vladivostok&lt;/span>;) to Harbin. At the same time, the railway was divided into The six ends of the east-west and south-west lines are being constructed in opposite directions at the same time. As the center of the 2,500-kilometer &quot;T&quot;-shaped railway that runs from Manzhouli in the west, Suifenhe in the east, and Lushun, Dalian in the south, it has quickly become an international city with &quot;sky-high buildings, merchants, soaring land prices, and every inch of land is precious.&quot; - &quot;The desolate wilderness turned into a prosperous port in an instant.&quot; Capitalism has become the &quot;power&quot; for Harbin&#39;s rapid growth and rise, but at the same time, foreign capital has inhibited and hindered the development of national capitalism, making it an &quot;alien&quot; between traditional Chinese cities and modern capitalist cities; a railway has even more influence on Harbin. The local architectural culture has had a huge impact, with a wave of compulsory and replacement architectural design trends - integration, addition, mutation... In the silent dusk more than a hundred years ago, in this city with wonderful characteristics, it began Continuously “cultivating”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/D2guwa6iQiMwc38cNPPYloIc751903YJ6dUZCGdE.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;718&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/D2guwa6iQiMwc38cNPPYloIc751903YJ6dUZCGdE.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251175&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Today&#39;s Harbin Railway Station and St. Iver&#39;s Church&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Meng Huizhong/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Red Army Street, which shoots out straight from Harbin Railway Station, was originally named Horvat Street. It is the starting point and germination of Harbin&#39;s city construction. It spreads outwards with it as the axis, showing the annual rings of the city&#39;s growth. The original site of the Longmen VIP Building was built in 1907. At the other end, there were the Russian Consulate General in Harbin and the Officers Club of the Russian Trans-Amur Military District, as well as the &quot;famous&quot; Yamato Hotel in the Northeast; the Sino-Russian Daosheng Bank, built in 1920, is now It is the Heilongjiang Provincial Research Museum of Literature and History, still maintaining the original French Renaissance style; the Cheschakov Tea House’s mixed classicism, baroque and Renaissance style exterior bay windows, overhanging awnings, and open-air balconies are set among the Among the green trees, looking at the signboard of &quot;HSBC Camera Company&quot;, it is difficult to imagine that it was designed by Zhdanov, a Russian Jewish architect who has lived in Harbin for 37 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Red Army Street and the east-west Dazhi Street once intersected at the ancient Gothic wooden structure St. Nicholas Church. Nowadays, there is no trace of the Church of San Nicola. The International Hotel built in 1937 looks like a huge accordion.

The octagonal exterior walls are stacked upward layer by layer to form a lovely eclectic building dominated by Baroque style. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another group of &quot;solemn vs. cute&quot; buildings is on Dazhi Street.

Twenty or thirty years after the Russo-Japanese War, Harbin has become an international city.

From 1899, when the first Russian Jew, S. I.

It is said that in the church on a snowy day in winter, the Byzantine-style appearance can allow more snow to stay on the surface of the building. The wind blows the snowflakes, which are like the ultimate romance in a crystal ball; on a snowy night, the church will turn into gold bricks. The castle with bright tiles and the towering cross are like stars in the night sky. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/V2YQMM3KsZcLyDiOizRXmYD6bVw7ZexK84FjSyq4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/V2YQMM3KsZcLyDiOizRXmYD6bVw7ZexK84FjSyq4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251178&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hagia Sophia on a snowy night, the scenery is as dreamy as a crystal ball. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you want to observe the details of the church quietly, the best time is at dusk. The full dark green dome full of momentum is lifted very high by the main body of the clear red brick building. The golden cross shines brightly, showing a dynamic beauty of rising successively. Viewed from the side, the tops of the four tents are staggered, and the slanting light shines on it. The architectural details cast mysterious shadows, honest and simple. Step into the church and enjoy the daily rotating concerts, as well as the mottled walls and Roman-style arched windows. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The setting sun reflects on the top of the church, which reminds people of its sister with the same name on the other side of the Eurasian continent, and also allows people to relive the rich history of the city&#39;s past. In fact, this church had &quot;humble origins&quot; and was only the military chapel of the 4th Infantry Division of Tsarist Russia in Eastern Siberia. In March 1907, it was renovated with funds from the Russian businessman Cheschakov, whose home was on Red Army Street. In 1912 A layer of bricks was laid on the original foundation. In 1923, the Russian architect Kasikov re-selected a site in the southeast corner of the old church and built it. It was completed in November 1932, giving it what it looks like today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/hdtifd6oogFdGgcFPgG8de1ZB92LWtDhnNDnlwJQ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;718&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/hdtifd6oogFdGgcFPgG8de1ZB92LWtDhnNDnlwJQ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251177&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Concert in Saint Sophia Church&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Meng Huizhong/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Saint Sophia The architectural style and decorative style of the church draw on the Russian brick carving art of the 17th century. The St. Alexeev Church at the corner of Gogol Street and Shikes Street organically combines a huge building volume with facade brick decoration. Giving it a strong Russian accent and unique mood. Although this century-old building, which was originally an Orthodox church and was converted into a Catholic church in 1980, also has a majestic and scattered beauty. Even under the clear blue sky in the northeast, it can be regarded as the appearance of the city&#39;s architecture, but it is not as lively as Sofia Square. There are very few people around after sunset. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Lights&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;: Chinese Baroque&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Qiulin Kvass rustles after opening the bottle cap. This famous drink looks like Beer, slightly red in color but with only 1% alcohol content, is very suitable for &quot;bottle blowing&quot; when traveling and hiking - such as walking from Alexeev Church, along Gogol Street to the L-shaped building built in 1908 A grand building with a light green tone - Qiulin Yangxing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many old buildings on Gogol Street, but while maintaining their former glory, they have inevitably declined and become dilapidated - just like Daowai District. To the north from the train station, east of the railway across the river, is the Daowai District, formerly known as &quot;Fujiadian&quot;, where immigrants from Shandong and Hebei settled in Guandong. Although it is one of the earliest urban centers in Harbin, due to the lack of complete and precise planning, in the 1930s the streets here were &quot;narrow and uneven&quot; and &quot;everywhere you go is so disgusting that you have to cover your nose and avoid it.&quot; &amp;nbsp;——The folk proverb at that time said: &quot;Nangang is heaven, inside the road is the world, and outside the road is hell.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unique &quot;Chinese Baroque&quot; architecture also grew here. Along the street, the Western Baroque facade is used, while incorporating the auspicious decorative patterns of traditional Chinese architecture. Iron railings or &quot;Guanyin bottle&quot;-style concrete railings are set up on the edge of the protruding platform. Stepping inside, it is purely a northern courtyard. The architectural shape combines earth and western elements, giving it its own charm. The Chinese Baroque neighborhood, which is mainly located on South Second and Third Streets and has been renovated into a tourist attraction, is lackluster. Many of the green brick streets and wide courtyards have been transformed into catering shops. They are more organized but lack the liveliness and prosperity of the past. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In contrast, the &quot;Chinese Baroque&quot; on Dong Jingyu Street in the neighborhood is the most authentic. Originally built in 1890, this long street was originally called Zhengyang Street. It is also the birthplace of Harbin&#39;s national commerce: Zhengyang Tower, Laodingfeng, Shiyitang, Daluoxin Department Store, Hengdeli, Tongji Shopping Mall... every inch of land Jin&#39;s Old Street used to be lined with businesses. At the intersection of Jingyu Street and Nantou Street, the four-story brick and wood structure Purification Hospital was built in 1920. It was formerly known as Tongyi Qinghuo Store. It is one of the masterpieces of &quot;Chinese Baroque&quot;: the swaying reliefs of vine flowers from Ioni The exterior walls of the sub-column and Corinthian columns are winding all the way down, and the gorgeous and luxurious style is unforgettable, fully reflecting the hope of fame of the national industrial and commercial people at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/H2HaomUi40Tfp1di33htXnYLR2z81FDQEy5p4fNF.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;718&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/H2HaomUi40Tfp1di33htXnYLR2z81FDQEy5p4fNF.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251179&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Purification Hospital located outside Laodao&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Meng Huizhong/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All famous, Prosperity and bustle have their end. Today&#39;s Laodaowai has lost its popularity due to large-scale construction, and its decline is fully visible: dilapidated buildings can be seen along the street, and the roofs are covered with decaying grass, as if the old buildings are sighing; the cats and dogs wandering on the street look full of vicissitudes of life. Feeling; beside the ruins, you can occasionally see small electric cars with the sign of &quot;darning&quot;, which is a common livelihood for middle-aged and elderly women in the Northeast - sewing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In old Harbin, if the window of &quot;Zhong&quot; is &quot;Zhengyang Street&quot;, the epitome of &quot;West&quot; is Central Street - in Xiao Hong&#39;s pen, the city street is like a &quot;complex and unclear color&quot; &quot;Map&quot;, Harbin today has similar characteristics - it is also a commercial street, Jingyu Street outside the road has become a large construction site, and Central Street inside the road, at 7 o&#39;clock in the morning, there are tourists wandering around carrying kvass bottles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/Jt6BaNZEvKBbBo0gbLrmB46GwPl3f8A6k8AsvD8z.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;718&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/Jt6BaNZEvKBbBo0gbLrmB46GwPl3f8A6k8AsvD8z.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251181&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Street scene in Laodaowai&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Meng Huizhong/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Night, spring night, Central Street is a night full of music. Music from homeless people, music from Japanese dance halls, music from foreign restaurants... After 7 o&#39;clock, in the middle of Central Street, at a crossroads, the loud loudspeaker screamed, this The singing almost resounded throughout the street.&quot; Xiao Hong once wrote about Central Street in &quot;Spring Hangs on the Treetops&quot;, with a lot of irony and banter; however, the &quot;gradually countless&quot; things she recorded were &quot;like long ropes pulled in the sun&quot; The bright lights, like a string of yellow copper bells, seem to be still hanging on the 1,450-meter-long Central Street, which starts from the Songhua River Flood Control Victory Memorial Tower in the north and ends at Jingwei Street in the south. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;On some side streets, it is quieter. The light of the street lamps imprints the shadows of the leaves on the road. The aging Russians are talking about the good days that no longer exist. ... In You may think it is ugly during the day, but on a beautiful night, you put beautiful clothes on everything, and everything seems to be beautiful.&quot; The shorter streets in Jin&#39;s works form a fish-like formation with the Central Street. The bone-shaped street layout supported the &quot;enchanting&quot; appearance of this street after the completion of the China-Eastern Railway in 1903, where foreign merchants gathered and shops were dotted; especially in 1924, the Russian engineer Komut Rashok was responsible for the design and supervision of the construction. After the rectangular bread-shaped granite pavement was replaced, the bread stone road replaced the muddy dirt road. The appearance of the street was greatly changed, and it became rich and luxurious. In the 1930s, Central Street had become an architectural art gallery and an international architectural expo. Both sides of the street Most of them are Baroque, Gothic, Renaissance and other styles of buildings, creating a beautiful skyline; there are many foreign stores, dance halls and cinemas, restaurants and bars... At that time, Central Street became a place of pilgrimage for commodity fetishism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/4cCg5StykNWAWuSug1zFc7uhbhVW0nLaG8gUXJHD.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;454&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/4cCg5StykNWAWuSug1zFc7uhbhVW0nLaG8gUXJHD.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251182&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;China Street (today’s Central Street) is beginning to take shape&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Yameng/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the streets paved with square stones, the sound of Victorian carriages has long since passed into the twilight of history. Only the pieces of breadstone that have been worn away by the passing years are still shining brightly on today&#39;s pedestrian streets. Visitors tell stories about the smoky past of the long street - on summer evenings, the brilliant sunset shines slantingly on more than 70 European-style and imitation European-style buildings, and they seem to have their own unique character. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Music: Soul of the North&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Of course, there is also the Madiel popsicle that is essential when visiting Central Street - Matsuura 1918 West, which was renovated in the Matsuura Yoko Building. Diagonally across from the restaurant is Madiel&#39;s cold drink hall. Nowadays, &quot;Madiel&quot; can be eaten all over the country at different prices, but it is said that they are all &quot;a bit uninteresting&quot;. You still have to buy 5 yuan a piece here, which is made in the front store and in the back factory, without wrapping paper, which is the most authentic: In winter, the daily sales here start at 10,000 sticks, and sales usually explode on New Year&#39;s Day, with 30,000 to 40,000 sticks sold a day. During the peak tourist season in Harbin, &quot;Naked Madiel in the North Wind&quot; is one of the features of Central Street. Everyone wants to &quot;cool themselves down to the bottom.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After nibbling on the popsicles, you can turn around and taste the hot red cabbage soup, mandarin fish in milk and delicious canned shrimps at the Madier Western Restaurant - since the Russians started cooking pots in Tianjia in 1898 With the opening of railway canteens, Russian-style Western food began to take root in China. In the Central Street area alone, there are Tadaos and Huamei (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;former Mars There are more than 30 Western restaurants such as Western Food Tea Shop&lt;/span>;) and Madiel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The food and delicacies are endlessly memorable, especially when accompanied by music - whether in Matsuura, Huamei, or Madiel’s own Western restaurant on the first floor, Madiel can often be heard in the summer The music show on the balcony on the second floor of the hotel includes violin music, saxophone performance or bel canto solo. Artists who appeared to be from Central and Eastern Europe took turns performing hard, attracting tourists to stop and adding a lot of excitement to Central Street. It was also reminiscent of their &quot;predecessors&quot;, the foreign musicians who gathered here in the first half of the 20th century. : In 1936, singers Alexander Wilkinsky and Fedor Chaliapin came to Kazakhstan to hold a concert; in 1938, 10-year-old Helmut Stern came to China with his parents, and at the age of 14 He held a concert in Harbin and later joined the Harbin Symphony Orchestra, which was founded in 1908 and was once known as the &quot;First Symphony Orchestra in the Far East.&quot; After going to Israel in 1948, he became the chief violinist of the Berlin Philharmonic... Starting in the 1920s, Foreigners in Harbin have founded nearly 30 music schools. The strong music atmosphere that has lasted for a century has become an important cornerstone for Harbin to be awarded the title of &quot;City of Music&quot; by the United Nations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/Pww276vsMjnYQx0VjT6gEc7pijLlfoy5G7WMWdzP.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;674&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/Pww276vsMjnYQx0VjT6gEc7pijLlfoy5G7WMWdzP.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251180&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Old view of Madier Hotel&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Yameng/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Madiel Hotel Er&#39;s balcony music show is just a small note in the &quot;Music City&quot;. &quot;In the Madier Hotel, that hotel with a big stage and a luxurious hall, a play was organized between the movie screenings and a dance program was started... I happily put aside the boring rehearsals of the troupe and went to them specifically There.&quot; Dancer and poet Larisa Angell lived in China for 34 years and often performed at the Madier Hotel founded by Russian Jew Joseph Kasper in 1906. Her beautiful figure and summer Photos of Ryabin and Wilkinski, as well as tableware, lamps, electrical appliances, accessories, and promotional posters of Madier Cinema, together form the &quot;historical and cultural corridor&quot; in the hotel; during her years of activeness in Harbin , this very ancient building on Central Street is regarded as &quot;having the most luxurious ballroom and restaurant, the most modern and comfortable guest rooms.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, the scenery of the Madier Hotel was unparalleled, until the &quot;Casper Kidnapping Case&quot; that shocked Harbin in 1933 came to an abrupt end. On the evening of August 24 of that year, after dining at the Madier Western Restaurant, Simon, the son of Joseph Kasper Sr., was kidnapped by the Inspector General of the Kazakhstan Police Department, Martinov, and 15 gangsters; on December 3, Simon’s body was found It was discovered in Xiaoling near Harbin, causing an outcry. The following year, the sad old Joseph took his wife and children and left for France. Soon he died of illness in Paris. Madier also declined from glory to glory. Only the leather bag left by Casper in the &quot;Historical and Cultural Corridor&quot; of the hotel can be traced. Talk about being a witness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 25, 1948, representatives of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and democrats such as Shen Junru and Zhang Bojun in Kazakhstan reached an &quot;Agreement on Various Issues Concerning the Convening of a New Political Consultative Conference&quot; in the No. 1 conference room of the Madier Hotel. . At that time, the 73-year-old &quot;Heng Lao&quot; Shen Junru lived in a hotel and often went for walks along the Songhua River. He saw the rare scene of the river freezing and then thawing again, so he wrote a poem: &quot;After the river freezes, I see rushing water and snow. Even the tide is not full. The atmosphere of the earth also changes with people and events. From now on, geese from the north no longer have to go south.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/09/19/MeUDNfEc5bjBva429SBk5G5VHfqoybUYFksExSJs.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;718&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/ MeUDNfEc5bjBva429SBk5G5VHfqoybUYFksExSJs.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251183&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The Dormition Church in the Cultural Park&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa ;&quot;>;(Meng Huizhong/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The south bank of the Songhua River at the end of Central Street is Stalin Park, a narrow and long &quot;riverside&quot;.
