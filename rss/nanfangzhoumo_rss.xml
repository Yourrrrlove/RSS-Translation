My pronunciation is actually Japanese pronunciation, because they are almost the same as the pronunciation of &quot;Dunhuang&quot; and &quot;Kumaroshi&quot; when I learned about it more than 20 years ago, so I was very impressed. This impression originated from a documentary produced by Japan&#39;s NHK TV station that I saw at that time: &quot;Silk Road&quot;. I am ashamed to say that before that, I had no understanding of either Dunhuang or Kumarajiva. Later, I gradually learned that Dunhuang has an extraordinary status in the hearts of Japanese people. In October 2018, I went to Dunhuang for the first time due to a meeting. After transferring in Xi&#39;an, I found that I was on the same plane with a Japanese tour group, and the TONKOU images in my memory flashed back frame by frame. At that time, I secretly sighed: Japan’s “Dunhuang Fever” is indeed well-deserved. Speaking of the origin of &quot;Dunhuang fever&quot; in Japan, this book published in 1943 is undoubtedly one of the initiators. Since this book is a &quot;novel&quot;, to avoid spoilers, the content will not be mentioned here. However, readers must have realized by now that it might be a pity to read this book as a novel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73794&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70583&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/30/6ddafb8163.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;Killing Season.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1484&quot; style=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;//images .infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/6ddafb8163.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260274&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;《 &quot;Killing Season: A History of the Indonesian Genocide 1965-1966&quot;, written by [Additional] Robinson, translated by Xie Kankan and Roger, World Knowledge Press, June 2023. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the six months starting from October 1965, approximately 500,000 members of the Indonesian Communist Party and its affiliated organizations were killed, becoming the leader of the twentieth century. One of the most famous massacres in human history. What was the cause of this massacre? What is the identity of the executioner who carried out the massacre? What role did the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and other major powers play in this tragedy? These may be some questions that our general readers will think of. The author of this book is a well-known expert on the politics of Southeast Asian countries. Therefore, although this book is titled &quot;History&quot;, it is not a general straightforward narrative, but has clear analytical features. The author carefully depicts the distribution of the huge energy that triggered the massacre along several cracks within Indonesia such as ideology, military-political relations, religious beliefs, and ethnic identity. Of course, because it involves many complex and sensitive issues such as religion and race relations, the author writes with different shades of ink, which can be said to be prudent; however, the almost rare silence of the countries involved on this incident has been overshadowed by this excellent historical research Totally shattered. The people want the truth, and that is what true learning is about. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73795&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70584&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/30/bda9db9a0d.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;Real and Virtual.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1591&quot; style=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/bda9db9a0d.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260275&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>; &quot;Reality and Virtuality: Philosophy in the Post-Truth Era&quot;, by Jin Guantao&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;, CITIC Publishing Group, July 2023. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The word &quot;philosophy&quot; in the subtitle of this book actually refers to &quot;philosophy of authenticity&quot;, and the core part of this book can be positioned as &quot;philosophy of science&quot; &quot;Epistemology&quot; or &quot;theory of knowledge.&quot; Having said that, we understand that there is a high threshold to cross in order to read this book. However, the book&#39;s argument is unusually clear because the author has a consistent model throughout. This model is very simple: authenticity R (X, M, Y) is a structure composed of subject X, control means M and object Y. The &quot;authenticity&quot; of object Y only depends on the universal repeatability of M. . So, isn’t this just a repetition of the basic methods of modern scientific research? Not so; the author realizes that authenticity should be divided into three incommensurable fields: science, individual and society, and therefore wants to establish a unified theory for this purpose. In this book, such as the theoretical blind spots of Kuhn, who was famous in the field of scientific philosophy in the 20th century, the &quot;kingdom of lies&quot; spun by humanistic intellectuals who regard themselves as academic leftists in European and American circles, and the opinions of great physicists such as Einstein on mathematical abilities. &quot;Surprised&quot;, and even the properties of gauge field theory and superstring theory, which are the most cutting-edge in theoretical physics, the author has given his own very unique and bold views, which can be said to have great philosophical ambitions. In the process of reading this book, I would often compare it with my own experience gained from studying and researching in recent years. Although the results are similar and different, they all made me think deeply. This can be said to be due to the author&#39;s strong and clear extreme thinking ability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73796&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70585&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/30/5c87f2a91e.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;Qiu Chengtong&#39;s Mathematics Concept.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1566&quot; style=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;/ /images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/5c87f2a91e.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260276&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong >;&quot;Truth and Beauty: Qiu Chengtong&#39;s Views on Mathematics&quot;, written by Qiu Chengtong, Jiangsu Phoenix Literature and Art Publishing House, August 2023. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When I just finished reading this book, I had a &quot;delusional&quot; thought: Is there a channel for at least all junior high schools, high schools and universities in the country to Have all math teachers read this book? After years of reading, I can see that such original Chinese works that are full of vitality are extremely rare. Reading them makes me feel refreshed. This makes me sigh from time to time: Mr. Qiu is really a powerful gentleman and a great scholar in the world. This great strength is not only reflected in his courageous advancement in mathematical research, but also in his outspoken criticism of the low academic style that takes fame and fortune in the academic world. It is also reflected in his enthusiasm for cultivating students. It is also reflected in the fact that he has a secret that is not easily known to others. The psychological mechanism: &quot;Study the relationship between heaven and man, understand the changes of ancient and modern times, and become a family.&quot; This is the famous saying of Tai Shigong, and I don&#39;t know how many scholars have been inspired. I have seen criticism of him on the Internet, to the general effect that Yau Shing Tong is domineering; for some details of the story, please refer to &quot;My Geometric Life: The Autobiography of Yau Shing Tong&quot;. At that time I thought: Well, as long as the critics can point to one of the above four points, I will accept it; otherwise, please listen to your instructions. In fact, if we look at the Chinese people who have left their names in the history of human science since the 20th century, one of their teachers is Chen Shengren, Yang Zhenning is another, and the third one is Yau Shing-tung. However, in terms of being able to make decisions for real academics and scholars, there may be no one at the moment who can surpass them. Master once said: &quot;Virtue is never alone, it must have neighbors.&quot; Good readers of this book will definitely agree with this statement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73797&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70586&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/30/254212bb7b.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;Conquest and Culture.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1622&quot; style=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/254212bb7b.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260277&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>; &quot;Conquest and Culture: A History of the World&quot;, written by&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;[&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;US] Sowell, translated by Jiang Lin, CITIC Publishing Group, October 2023. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The author of this book is a famous black economist, thinker and public intellectual in the United States, and is also labeled as a &quot;black conservative&quot; . Knowing this background, it will be easier to understand the tepid style of the book: although the author is outspoken about the evils caused by the conquest of the major Western colonial empires in the nineteenth century, such as the slave trade and the massacre of Indians, he does not High-profile accusations. His economic perspective gave him an awareness of &quot;conquest and culture&quot; from the perspective of human natural history. For example, the situation of black people on plantations in the United States in the 19th century was better than that on plantations in Latin America. The reason was that the price of purchasing slaves in the United States was relatively high. Naturally, slave owners did not want their property to suffer losses easily, so there was a trend of preferring to hire slaves. Irish immigrants doing dangerous jobs. So, how does the author view the issue of &quot;colonial conquest&quot;? It can be said that the violent conflicts in the current world are still a continuation of this helpless natural history of mankind. The pace of progress of human civilization seems increasingly slow and heavy today. Because of his special ethnic identity, the author&#39;s relatively gentle and tolerant reappearance of this period of history, as well as his quiet criticism of &quot;tribalism&quot;, make his expressions and thoughts more meaningful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font -family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The author is an associate professor in the Department of Political Science, East China Normal University)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br >;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/ a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[作为文本的茶馆丨记者手记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258517]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/27/k7XSaOnKmcU72AMhUa66c91RrEJSV10jWfkJLuh9.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/k7XSaOnKmcU72AMhUa66c91RrEJSV 10jWfkJLuh9. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252385&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wang Di at Heming Tea House in Chengdu People&#39;s Park&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa ;&quot;>;(Hua Xiaofeng/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For relevant reports, please see &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https:// www.infzm.com/contents/257991&quot; title=&quot;Wang Di: Historian in the Teahouse&quot;>;Wang Di: Historian in the Teahouse&lt;/a>;》&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Di’s generation in Chengdu When people meet, they like to say, &quot;I eat three flowers in my mouth.&quot; &quot;Kouzi&quot; means &quot;Jiekou&quot;. &quot;啖&quot; means &quot;to eat&quot;. Su Dongpo&#39;s famous sentence &quot;Eating three hundred lychees a day&quot; will be pronounced more accurately in Sichuan dialect. This is easy to understand. The term &quot;Three Flowers&quot; requires experienced Chengdu people to explain it in detail before they can understand it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I first met Wang Di, I proposed to sit in a teahouse. Wang Di said, let’s meet at Heming Teahouse in People’s Park. At Heming Teahouse, as soon as we sat down, Wang Di explained what &quot;three flowers&quot; were. &quot;When I was a child, I drank third-grade flower tea, which is the most popular tea. I went to the United States in 1991, and when I returned to Chengdu in 1997, I went to a teahouse to drink tea. The tea waiter asked, what kind of tea should I drink? I said, &#39;Sanhua&#39; &#39;. He said that the worst ones now are &#39;special flower&#39; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 混体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Special Flower Tea&lt;/span>;).&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;From &quot;three flowers&quot; to &quot;special flowers&quot;, it seems to conform to a certain &quot;law&quot; of &quot;rising&quot; along time. Wang Di said that maybe the &quot;Special Flower&quot; now is the &quot;Sanhua&quot; back then, but the name has just been changed. Older Chengdu people say &quot;eat tea with your mouth in mind&quot;. At that time, there was not even the word &quot;三花&quot;. An author signed by &quot;Follower&quot; made a somewhat pessimistic prediction in a Chengdu newspaper in 1942: &quot;As long as society progresses and a replacement for the teahouse appears, it will definitely decline or even cease to exist.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;Wang Di wrote at the end of &quot;Teahouse: Public Life and Microcosm in Chengdu, 1900-1950&quot;: &quot;A few hours later, they will still open the door of the teahouse just like they did on the first day of the century fifty years ago. They were unloaded piece by piece, but they didn’t know that together with this city, they had entered a completely different era that, although vigorous, no longer belonged to teahouses and tea guests.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to write this Teahouses in different eras, thus &quot;Teahouse: The Decline and Renaissance of Public Life in Chengdu, 1950-2000&quot;. Wang Di was born in 1956 and has more personal experience of Chengdu teahouses during this period. These two books constitute a century-old history of teahouses in Chengdu. &quot;Although the theme of this century-old history is teahouses, it is also a century-old economic history, a century-old social history, a century-old cultural history, a century-old popular history, a century-old history of daily life, and even a century-old Chinese city&#39;s history seen from the microcosm of the teahouse. The history of character.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Di&#39;s years of writing about teahouses earned him the second biennial (2018-2019) &quot;Best Book Award&quot; from the American Urban History Society. The award citation said: &quot;This book adopts a multi-disciplinary research orientation, adopts anthropological and sociological research methods and theories, and mines various historical documents, including newspapers, diaries, personal records, and oral data of teahouse culture, so that This research is very in-depth.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For media professionals, Wang Di’s works have a lot to learn from. How to think big from the micro? How to see the times from ordinary people? How to find new ideas from numerous materials? These are common problems we face. Wang Di took me to many places. The feeling of telling history on the spot is extraordinary. It allows people to see three-dimensional and rich details, and naturally compare teahouses and tea guests in time and space. Everything is emotional. The collision and fusion of opinions and rational thoughts will form complex and fresh texts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Texts, or &quot;fragments,&quot; written by specific individuals provide new perspectives on history. Everyone adds their own text to history itself, so that history will be richer and more visible, and it will continue to get closer to the &quot;reality&quot; itself. There is no overall history, only ever-expanding history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[短剧制造者：哪有什么一夜暴富？不过是流量的打工仔]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261641]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The shooting scene in Xuanpingli, Dahan, Xi&#39;an.

Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Luo Huanhuan&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Short plays are popular, but what are short plays? There are many descriptions in the industry: &quot;small local drama&quot;, &quot;mini program short drama&quot;, &quot;vertical screen drama&quot;, &quot;paid short drama&quot;, &quot;one-minute short drama&quot;... These words are put together to form the legendary &quot;short drama&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a video-based novel. You have to jump to WeChat, Douyin, and Kuaishou mini programs to watch it. The first few episodes are free, and then one yuan per episode, one minute per episode, and one episode is about 100 episodes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After all, it is more expensive than watching a movie, and the box office is about the same as a movie. Industry insiders have speculated based on internal data released by Douyin that annual sales can exceed 30 billion. By comparison, the national movie box office in 2022 will only be 30.067 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past month, this kind of imagination has made capital excited, and stocks related to short dramas have experienced skyrocketing prices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of November 22, 2023, Tianwei Video and Chinese Online have both increased by more than 140% within the month, and Gravity Media, Guangbo Shares, Jiayun Technology, etc. have increased by more than 60%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The unfinished story of capital is that this business looks very &quot;rich&quot;, but in fact it is difficult to make money. Many industry insiders told Southern Weekend reporters that the profit rate will not exceed 10%. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;90% of the income is used to pay for advertising on Douyin, Kuaishou, and WeChat. They are the driving forces behind the short drama’s popularity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person in charge of a short drama platform told a Southern Weekend reporter that the life of short dramas is given by traffic. It can make you rich overnight, or it can make you lose money overnight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said, just like e-commerce and merchants, &quot;If we don&#39;t support you to go online, your goods will sell hundreds of thousands a month, but if we support you, it will be tens of millions.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An industry insider explained that according to Douyin’s traffic bidding mechanism, the cost of acquiring customers for short dramas is actually the result of competition with e-commerce, live streaming, games and other industries. Short dramas can acquire customers at a lower cost. Guest, this is the fundamental reason for its rise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the ability of other industries to pay for traffic is weakening, and their ability to pay for traffic affects the future of short dramas. &quot;If live broadcasts become popular again next year, or those live broadcast rewards are at the top of the list, If guys are willing to pay for gifts again, they will steal more traffic with higher bids, and this will truly end the future of short dramas.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Right now, the leaders in the industry are deploying their own apps in order to seize this period of time and keep users on their own platforms, thereby getting rid of dependence on traffic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In late November, the wild growth of short dramas ushered in a new round of supervision, and the State Administration of Radio and Television once again launched a one-month special rectification work on online micro-short dramas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Major short video platforms have removed a large number of illegal micro-short dramas from the shelves and banned a large number of accounts that have illegally published micro-short dramas. The micro-short drama &quot;Black Lotus&#39; Handbook for Ascension&quot; produced by Mi Meng&#39;s team was removed from the shelves for &quot;exaggerating the bad values ​​of extreme revenge and using violence to counter violence.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A short drama platform founder told Southern Weekend reporters that supervision had begun as early as November last year, and starting from March 2023, the platform will also require &quot;review before broadcasting.&quot; In the past year, &quot;Every episode will be reviewed. After review, you will be given clear instructions whether you have passed the review or not, such as too many intimate scenes, etc.&quot; The founder has also had one or two dramas abandoned due to too many revisions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since a large number of companies in the industry have transformed from online novel platforms, most companies are equipped with &quot;self-reviewers&quot;. &quot;Overall, it does not have a big impact on us.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his view, supervision is a good thing. Now everyone is waiting for the &quot;Detailed Rules for the Creation, Production and Content Review of Online Micro-Short Dramas&quot; formulated by the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television. With it, the waste of investment caused by failure to review will be reduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The State Administration of Radio, Film and Television has launched a special rectification work on online micro-short dramas since late November 2022, and has removed from the shelves more than 25,000 short dramas, totaling 1.36 million episodes, and &quot;small-format dramas&quot; that contain illegal content. Programs&quot; 2420. From March 2023 to the present, more than 350,000 episodes (strips) of vulgar and harmful online mini-drama have been cleared, and 429 related &quot;mini programs&quot; and 2,988 accounts have been dealt with at different levels. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Xi&#39;an has become a center for short dramas&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Sorry, my voice is hoarse.&quot; Li Tao has to meet more than a dozen people every day, &quot;Chen Ou flew to Xi&#39;an yesterday, just to gather beautiful and beautiful people. As for Chen Ou, some state-backed companies also came to me to see if there was any possibility of cooperation.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Tao is the founder of Fengxing Studio, which was originally a little-known film and television company. Previously, it mainly produced information flow advertisements and occasionally hosted weddings. I just started filming short plays last year when I couldn&#39;t get any work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Douyin releases an advertising consumption list every week. Being on the list is considered a hit. In the past year, Li Tao filmed 14 short dramas, 9 of which were on the list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Especially &quot;Wushuang&quot;, which was online for 24 hours, had a top-up of more than 50 million, and consumed 100 million ads in 8 days. It became this year&#39;s &quot;King of Dramas&quot; and Feng Xing became a &quot;hot star&quot; in the industry overnight. Fried chicken&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Li Tao was doing information flow advertising before, Xi&#39;an gathered more than half of the country&#39;s information flow advertising shooting team. After the short drama became popular, Xi&#39;an also transformed from an information flow advertising production base to a short drama center. Li Tao said, &quot;Sometimes, nine out of ten hits on the list come from Xi&#39;an.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Tao moved his office to Xi&#39;an Silk Road Center at the beginning of this year. There is a floor-to-ceiling window with a 270° panoramic view, overlooking the entire Chanba Ecological Zone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He regards this place as his blessed place. &quot;After moving here, the drama started to explode.&quot; More and more people came to him. He added a large coffee table, prepared a complete set of tea sets, and learned Acting like a southern businessman, he made Kung Fu tea for the guests. &quot; I want to feel happy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What people who come to drink tea are most concerned about is whether there is a password for the popular product? Li Tao&#39;s answer is &quot;book&quot;. A good script plus good production equals a big hit. A good script plus poor production equals a small hit. A bad script plus good production may not necessarily lead to a hit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Someone re-filmed &quot;Wushuang&quot;, &quot;I just changed the character names, even the actors&#39; sentences were the same, and the result was still a hit, which shows that the script is really good,&quot; Li Tao said . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He can read dozens of scripts a week and has developed a skill. &quot;After watching the first episode, I can guess the content of the next dozen episodes.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For these production teams, only by making hits can they have the opportunity to select good scripts. Only by selecting good scripts can they have the opportunity to make more hits. In order to get a good script, they are even willing to advance funding for filming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But what kind of book will explode? &quot;This is a metaphysics.&quot; Li Tao is more confident about how to present a good script. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first time I found the feeling of filming a short play was during the Spring Festival this year. At 3 a.m. on the sixth day of the lunar month, he checked the surveillance on his mobile phone and found that two shareholders were working overtime in the office to edit a film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fengxing has six shareholders, all of whom have been friends for more than ten years. Li Tao felt uncomfortable, &quot;My brothers are working overtime, and I am celebrating the New Year at home. This is not going to work. I called the others and said, Let’s go to the company and work overtime together.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At around four in the morning, six people were editing a film in the company. The first episode was cut out to 3 minutes, but the pace was not fast enough and the impact was not strong enough. Everyone started arguing while talking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One side believed that the story should be complete and the main line should be clearly explained. The other side believed that the pace should be fast and the impact should be strong. No one could convince anyone. The final decision was that &quot;one person would cut one version and compare it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After comparing the two versions, the controversy disappeared. &quot;The audience will definitely know what this is about through two short sentences.&quot; Li Tao explained to Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;The core of the short play is The rhythm, if it is very long, it will be over if you feel relaxed.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Short dramas need to subvert many concepts in the past. The experience of the traditional film and television industry has become a burden for short dramas. Now, compared to mature actors in the traditional sense, Li Tao prefers actors with experience in short plays. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Xi&#39;an has become a center for short dramas.

Photographed by Southern Weekend reporter Luo Huanhuan&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Between being happy and not happy&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Wu Shuang&quot; tells the story of the male protagonist Chu Qing who helps his wife make a comeback. After the wife becomes famous, she dislikes her husband and wants to divorce. But she didn&#39;t know that Chu Qing&#39;s other identity was the supreme master of the Dragon Palace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This drama has never explained what the Dragon Palace is, why it has supreme power, why Chu Qing needs to conceal his identity, he has to prove his identity, why can&#39;t he just say it...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Li Tao’s experience is that there is no need to pursue logic and rationality. “Many themes are fictitious. You don’t need to worry about which dynasty it is, or trace whether it is from the Song Dynasty or the Tang Dynasty. It is just a costume drama, the Three Palaces and Six Dynasties.” The courtyard is a matter between the emperor and his concubines.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key to the short drama is to control the audience&#39;s emotions and keep them in a state of &quot;between being happy and not yet happy&quot;. A small hook must be left at the end of each episode to make everyone want to read on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first and paid episodes are the key to a short drama. Li Tao&#39;s experience is that people must be retained in the first episode, and paid episodes are usually set before the biggest suspense is solved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On average, editors at Fengxing Studio edit 1.6 episodes of short dramas a day, including the first episode and paid episodes, which usually take 5 to 15 days. Editor Er Pang told Southern Weekend reporters that their requirement is that &quot;every frame must be meaningful&quot; and there is no way to add water to a short drama. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Tao described that a good screenwriter can stabilize the audience&#39;s emotions, set a hook every time, and untie the hook reasonably, so that the suspense is still there and the audience will not lose patience. For example, the male protagonist has been suppressed for two episodes, and his emotions are almost suppressed. A small reversal is interspersed to stabilize the audience&#39;s emotions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of high-reversal, high-frequency, fast-paced plot is designed to stop the brain from thinking. &quot;As soon as you think about it, I fail,&quot; a short drama producer told a Southern Weekend reporter , &quot;When you think about it later, you will wonder whether the money was worth it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Tao introduced, &quot;We meet the needs of users in minutes,&quot; which is faster and more exciting. It is denser, has more reversals and fuller emotions. He believes that short plays have created an unprecedented form of film and television. &quot;I have never seen anything so dramatic in the history of film. No matter how good the film is, it cannot be cut into one minute.&quot; Sell ​​by the minute.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the professional shooting team in Hengdian, these &quot;people on the margins of the film and television industry&quot; in Xi&#39;an have an advantage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They once visited Hengdian for inspection and found that they still use traditional film and television techniques to shoot short dramas. The sound and pictures are recorded separately, the picture quality is 4K, and large machines are used to shoot on site. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The production team in Xi&#39;an can sometimes shoot a 100-minute drama in four days. In order to improve efficiency, the picture and sound are recorded at the same time. The picture quality is 2K. All shooting machines are handheld and no large machines are used. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some traditional film and television people will also come to Li Tao to communicate. He obviously feels that, &quot;From the other side&#39;s heart, they don&#39;t like short dramas, and they feel that they are doing big dramas. But this does not exist Many big teams looked down on dimensionality reduction at first, but then they wanted to do it but found that they couldn&#39;t do it. This is a very common phenomenon in short dramas.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In less than a year, this office that brought good luck to Li Tao was already overcrowded. On the day of the interview with Southern Weekend reporters, Li Tao had just found a new office, &quot;more than a thousand square meters.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“The protagonist is either a security guard or a delivery person”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When Wang Xiaoshu started filming short plays in 2021, no one was optimistic about the short plays. “The first batch of people who filmed short plays , taking me as an example, they may all be losers.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2020, he founded Jia Shu Technology, a free novel platform. &quot;The business will not close, but it is not very good either.&quot; Seeing the story experts on Kuaishou, he felt that it was very similar to online novels. &quot;If we produce novels such as Son-in-law and God of War, which we are good at, there should be a market.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2021, he filmed his first short drama &quot;The Strongest Female Security Guard&quot;. He didn&#39;t use a film camera, just a camera. &quot;It&#39;s a bit too much to call it a drama. You can&#39;t imagine how crude it is.&quot; The budget was 30,000 yuan to shoot for 100 minutes. &quot;I didn&#39;t even accept weddings, saying it was too cheap.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He remembered that, including Jia Shu Technology, there were maybe four short drama companies at that time. &quot;The protagonist of the short play is either a security guard or a food delivery guy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He found a Kuaishou expert in Tongnan, Chongqing. &quot;In Tongnan, one led one by one, and there were several teams specializing in photographing security guards. Their names were all very crude, and they were called &#39;shooting jokes&#39;.&quot; &#39;&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to film a story, Wang Xiaoshu flew from Shanghai to Chongqing Jiangbei Airport, then took a three-hour bus ride, and finally met his heroine in a remote town - a story with millions of fans. Blogger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This business is also very magical to me, and I don’t know how to shoot it.” Wang Xiaoshu asked the expert to shoot the popular content on Kuaishou again. “At that time, I can’t say that I was polishing it. , I can only say that in order to extend the time, enrich the dialogue, and add a bit of conflict.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The purpose is to leave space for recharging. &quot;Users have to watch about 10 minutes before paying, and the whole show is only 30 minutes. It feels bad to pay. For fifty, sixty, seventy or eighty episodes, users The recharge space will be larger.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everything is very primitive, there are no actors, &quot;her grandfather, grandmother, and cousin came to help&quot;, and the venue did not cost any money, &quot;just in front of a factory that has stopped production.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was very hot in Chongqing in July, so I had to take a break after taking a photo. Wang Xiaoshu squatted in front of the factory with an umbrella and finished the photoshoot in four days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The other party also suspected that he was a liar and asked him to pay the money in one lump sum. The reason was: &quot;A similar story has been published on Kuaishou. If you shoot it again, will anyone see it?&quot;&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;Wang Xiaoshu actually had no idea, &quot;it was too shoddy&quot;, but he soon discovered that he was wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Middle-aged and elderly people love to watch it&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;He bought 100,000 yuan of traffic for &quot;The Strongest Female Security Guard&quot; on the WeChat public account, and then played it on the mini program after on-demand viewing. The reason why we choose mini programs is that it is much easier than promoting apps. After all, the cost for users to download and install is very high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The platform charges a channel fee from the recharge he withdraws. The channel fee for the WeChat mini program has risen to 5-8 yuan per 100 yuan, while Douyin only costs 1-2 yuan, but WeChat is still the big one. &quot;Short drama&quot; The audience is more accustomed to using WeChat to pay, and Douyin needs to be redirected, which will create an additional payment obstacle.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;&quot;The Strongest Female Security Guard&quot; has returned about 100,000 in almost 20 days,&quot; which gave Wang Xiaoshu a premonition that this model could work. &quot;There are still people watching this crude production, so let&#39;s make it better. You can get your money back.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The short dramas that became popular at first were all security dramas, and their audience was also summarized as the &quot;three guarantees&quot; personnel, &quot;security guards, cleaners, and nannies.&quot; However, Wang Xiaoshu discovered through the backstage that these people were not necessarily low-income groups. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After accumulating tens of millions of fans, Wang Xiaoshu made user portraits and found that half of them were over 45 years old. “Most people may think that when people get older, they stop reading. We found that when people get older, It’s very impressive to see.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After starting his business for more than four years, Wang Xiaoshu interacts with this group of people every day. He feels that the entertainment life of middle-aged and elderly people is very lacking. &quot;Young people have many activities and do not need to consume online. These dramas are not cheap. An episode costs about 60 cents, and 100 minutes costs 60 yuan. Middle-aged and elderly people have both money and leisure.&quot; Moreover, young people are very familiar with the Internet. &quot;You can find pirated copies if you search casually, and it is difficult to pay for short dramas.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The entry threshold for short plays is also very low. &quot;No need to think, no need to read, no need to think, everything is placed in front of you.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It completely follows the classification system of online articles, which is divided into male channels and female channels according to the gender of the audience. The consumption psychology of the two groups is also different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Female video drama consumers are all grandmothers or mothers, and the most popular themes are sadomasochism and sweet pets. Wang Xiaoshu felt that they were &quot;still very eager and longing for love.&quot; Their marriage may have been like this. They had never been in love when they were young, and they longed to be cared for. &quot;It should be said that people need to be loved throughout their lives.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More men watch short dramas than women, and the male dramas dominate. God of War is the most popular theme, followed by son-in-law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The self-media &quot;Short Drama Study Room&quot; found based on the statistics of the streaming list released by Douyin that among the popular short dramas from January to July 2023, the theme of God of War accounted for 32.98%, ranking second. It is a female video drama with a sadomasochistic theme, accounting for only 9.42%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called &quot;God of War&quot; refers to a person with a powerful identity who hides his identity and transforms into a small person. He is bullied by the villain and finally reveals his identity to fight back against the opponent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Xiaoshu said that security guards or couriers will make the audience feel more involved. &quot;In reality, these groups are not respected, but in dreams they are very powerful and have status.&quot; It empathizes with the suppression and is released from the protagonist&#39;s counterattack. &quot;Dignity is something that many men lack on a daily basis.&quot; Wang Xiaoshu believes that short dramas can satisfy them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Short plays are used to create dreams. What does a dream look like? The dream is when he threatens you with &#39;bad reviews&#39;, and you suddenly laugh and say, &#39;Actually, I am a rich second generation, I will Being a delivery boy is just about experiencing life, but has it suddenly changed?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Wushuang&quot; combines the elements of God of War and son-in-law. &quot;The male protagonist conceals his identity and becomes the son-in-law, not because he is not strong enough. It&#39;s because I like that woman, and her strong identity will always be made public.&quot; Li Tao feels, &quot;People who are suppressed by their wives or mother-in-law in life can be greatly released here.&quot; &lt;p>; com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/e2488df4d8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;2337&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/11/30/e2488df4d8.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260288&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Wushuang&quot;, online for 24 hours recharge With over 50 million, he became this year’s “King of Dramas”. Picture source: Screenshot of the film &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Unexpected interests &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; After March 2022 Millions suddenly rose to tens of millions. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Douyin and WeChat achieved interoperability at the end of 2021, and short dramas have become beneficiaries. Wang Xiaoshu said that in the past, he could recover 40%on the first day of buying traffic. After the Douyin allowed to jump to the WeChat Mini Program, &quot;the recovery was 100%on the day.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Douyin also invited a short drama platform to start in March 2022 (that is, the merchant paid to increase the traffic), which brought a huge turn to the industry. The flow consumption is 80 million a day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Wang Xiaoshu believes that the first year of the short drama was 2021. In June of that year, the WeChat ecosystem opened short dramas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Actually before that, there were a lot of micro -short dramas. For example, Tencent Video&#39;s &quot;Please!&quot; Don&#39;t spoil me &quot;, the amount of the third quarter of the third quarter reached 32.49 million yuan, known as the short drama&quot; Drama King &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But these short dramas are not paid short dramas. Its business monetization is still platform subsidy, and the big head is still the production fee. &quot;please! &quot;Don&#39;t spoil me&quot; production costs are as high as 20 million, and the advertising cost is only millions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; These short dramas are essentially the business model of long videos. The broadcast platform will be divided by the production party according to the click rate of thousands of people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The paid short drama adopts the business model of online novels. The monetization path is the user paid on -demand, but more than 90%of the income must be paid to the advertising fee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This set of business models is completely rooted in the CPS model of online novels, that is, the copyright owner opens the promotion link to the distributor, and the distributor will create secondary creations on the materials. Attracting users to recharge, the two parties shall be divided according to the recharge amount. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Most of the short drama companies have done novel business before, such as Chinese online, nap, peanuts, etc. have their own network distribution system. They are the core of the industry, the copyright party, and the most important resource -script. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is connected to the producer like Fengxing Studio. The copyright party will give the other party some guarantee costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is a current distributor, and the copyright party provides technical and content, and is drawn 15%from the recharge. There are also short drama companies to distribute them by themselves. Kyushu Culture is a company with a market -based company with a research team of 300 people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The distribution is the lowest downstream of the short drama industry and the most mysterious and low -key group. Mu Changqing and several short -headed drama platforms are very familiar. He is the founder of the &quot;28 Push&quot; short drama community in the market community. , The script party. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He told the southern weekend reporter, &quot;Most of the well -made distribution is very low -key, and never dry cakes because they are afraid of being dug.&quot; Seeing that some media reports said that the team of e -commerce brushing made the short drama, he believed that it was inconsistent with the facts. &quot;The mainstream short drama platform I know includes their main distributors. of&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Distribution is a very resources industry. &quot;The distribution is done well, most of which are related to the platform.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The return on return refers to the money that users recharge after buying traffic. Mu Changqing introduced, &quot;If the information party is underwritten, if it is a private e -commerce, it is good to return 60%to 80%of the day, because the private domain will slowly return to the book. , The return on investment must reach 150%to make money. In comparison, the short drama is doing well to 130%. &quot;Mu Changqing said that short dramas are also a few projects that can be returned to this day. Many powerful distribution companies They all chose to do short dramas, &quot;I feel that I can grab this cake.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Yan Min, the founder of &quot;Pedestrians in the Short Drama&quot;, has also done a short drama distribution business. He is different from Mu Changqing&#39;s point of view. It is not easy, &quot;the drama that can reach such a return rate can be regarded as the &#39;magic drama&#39;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The short drama is actually difficult to make money. Yan Min said, &quot;As long as the return rate exceeds 105%, it will continue to invest. 100 yuan advertisement, recharge 105 yuan, pay Tencent 5 yuan for 5 yuan Artificially is actually losing money. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He explained that the core of the current is to start, recharge 100 million, and the profit margin is only 1%, and it can also earn 1 million. There is no starting volume, a recharge of 100,000, a profit margin of 10%, and a profit of only 10,000, still losing money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The current system of Douyin can set the return rate. For example, if you throw 100,000 first, the return rate is 110%. Only when the user recharge 110,000 can the next round of flow be triggered. The distributors will expand the scale as much as possible without losing money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Yan Min said that distribution is an industry with high labor costs and thin profit margins. profitable&quot;. In the entire industrial chain, the threshold for distributors has the lowest threshold and the thinnest profit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The short drama uses the content as the king, and the copyright party is the highest threshold, and it is them mainly to make money. They can only provide technology and content to let the distributors bear the current cost. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The producer is also risky. Wang Xiaoshu said, &quot;In a month, 30 dramas, the content cost will cost 10 million. If the box office does not have 100 million, you will lose money? This has not been considered the platform&#39;s own labor expenditure. &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; The real winner is only the traffic side &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; The short drama is already a red sea. Wang Xiaoshu calculated the account. According to the daily consumption of the daily consumption before the Douyin, a monthly short drama flowing water It is about 2 billion, corresponding to about 700 new dramas. The production cost of a drama is about 300,000, and the average flow of 3 million is just profitable. In fact, the explosion has taken most of the share, and most of the short dramas are less than 3 million, which is a loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Mu Changqing said, &quot;Many media think that the recharge of 30 million can make 30 million yuan. If the setting is 110%of the current return rate, the gross profit is only 3 million.&quot; The profit is only 1 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Yan Min believes, &quot;Those people deliberately say so easily, just want to cut leeks and let others invest.&quot; Some traditional industries boss will mistakenly think that hundreds of thousands of investment can have tens of millions of income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The real winner of the short drama industry is the flow of traffic, and most of the income flows to Douyin, fast hands, WeChat, and the profit left to the industry is only about 10%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The producer generally needs to stick money to shoot. The short drama was posted more than 1 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Compared to the guarantee production fee given by the copyright party, the purpose of their money is to improve the quality. &quot;It is meaningless to earn you 100,000 production fees. I want it.&quot; He asked Southern Weekend reporter, &quot;50,000 and 5 million, which one do you want?&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; He has not been in the short drama circle for less than half a year. This is his first short drama. &quot;I see this me, me Will definitely win &quot;, if you can&#39;t win, even pay for your hobby. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Li Tao is more cautious than the newcomer. He calculated a account, &quot;More than 300,000 filmed a drama, the recharge reaches 3 million, and it can be profitable. If you are 600,000, you can get 78 million to make a profit. What about it? &quot;He hopes to make some more stable money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Chen Nan, the owner of Xi&#39;an Muzanli Film and Television, has made three explosions. The capital chain is broken, &quot;I don&#39;t know if I can support it next month.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; The movie or online drama industry is often a temporary team, but the short drama production company needs a assembly line to produce. Chen Nan raised more than 40 people in four shooting groups. The monthly salary must be 200,000 to 300,000. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Li Tao admitted, &quot;I can say responsiblely that less than 10%of the industry can really make money, 90%are losing money.&quot; After the short drama, the first explosion appeared. &quot;But everyone only saw the &#39;wolf eating meat&#39; and did not see the &#39;wolf beating&#39;.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In October 2023, Chen Ou announced that he was actively watching short dramas. One month later, he told the Southern Weekend reporter that &quot;still studying the research stage&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On November 26, the famous Hong Kong director Wang Jing appeared at a starting ceremony of a short drama. This may be the first startup ceremony organized by the short drama industry. You know, the vertical screen short drama The names of the actors have never appeared. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[监察官等级首次确定工作全面完成]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261626]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-30 19:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; As of mid-November, 31 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps City The county -level supervisor level determined that the work was completed for the first time. This marks the first time that the national supervisor level has been promoted since 2022 to complete the successful end of the work. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; Doing a good job in the level of supervisor is an important measure to deepen the reform of the national supervision system. It is of great significance to adhere to and improve the party and state supervision system, and promote the high -quality development of disciplinary inspection and supervision. Under the unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, the State Supervision Commission of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection took the lead and carried out from top to bottom. The party committees and disciplinary committees of various places have resolutely carrying political responsibilities, and strictly follow the relevant regulations such as the &quot;People&#39;s Republic of China Supervisor Law&quot; and &quot;Supervisor&#39;s Grade Management Measures (Trial)&quot;, and promote the first determination of the supervisor level. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; The provincial disciplinary committees&#39; supervision committees actively reported to the party committee at the same level to propose planning for planning for planning. The main leaders of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee presided over the meeting twice to study the confirmation of the supervisor level; Organize implementation. Under the leadership of the party committees at the same level, Hebei, Shandong, Shanghai, Sichuan, Zhejiang, Jilin, Jiangxi, Jiangxi, Xinjiang and Xinjiang&#39;s Corps and other places for the Discipline Inspection and Supervisory Commission of the Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision and Supervisory Commission were studied and issued, and detailed regulations on scope, approval procedures, and disciplinary requirements. Guangdong ’s post -production templates make key tips on the leakage links or matters; Hainan establishes a problem account to study the existing problems one by one to ensure accurate grasping policies, standardized work procedures, and strict discipline requirements. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; The work of determining the level of the supervisor as an important task, the disciplinary inspection and supervision organs at all levels carefully organize and implement it, and promote it carefully and steadily. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection issued the first phase of the supervisor&#39;s level to determine the work and answer for the first time, carefully answer the consultation of localities, and timely summarize the publishing and publishing the province&#39;s experience and practices to promote exchanges and mutual learning. The provincial disciplinary commissions and supervisors generally adopt the methods of issuing Q &amp; A, holding special training courses, and policy preaching in accordance with the actual situation to strengthen guidance and standardized procedures. Gansu, Henan, Hubei, Liaoning, Shaanxi, Tianjin, Tianjin, Yunnan, Chongqing, Anhui and other places to establish a working mechanism for the leading comrades, the specific responsibility of the leadership, the implementation of the organization and the implementation, and the close cooperation of the functional departments to set up a special work class , Actively strengthen communication with departments such as the Organization Department of the Party Committee, the establishment of the organization, and other departments to study and solve the problem. Guizhou selected some cities (states) disciplinary committees to conduct field surveys to study and solve difficult problems; Qinghai organized a special scheduling meeting according to different time nodes; since November, Ningxia has insisted on the &quot;day report&quot; and confused about the policies encountered. Formulate unified calibers with issues such as procedures; Shanxi summarizes the progress of the work of the province every month, and supervises and guidance on the slow progress of progress to ensure that the supervisor determines the work layer and orderly development for the first time. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; Insist on putting political standards first, strict standards, strictly review and check. Disciplinary commissions at all levels strictly follow the conditions of the supervisory supervisors, comprehensively understand the institutions, personnel, and establishment, comprehensively consider the performance of cadre morality, rank, etc., and determine the level in accordance with the law, scientifically and reasonably.

Among them, the case was: Li has repeatedly threatened the pesticides in the face of his wife Wang&#39;s workplace many times. In order to ensure personal safety, Wang&#39;s personal safety protection order to the court. The court believes that Li&#39;s self -injury and self -disabled will cause Wang to have nervousness and fear, which is a spiritual infringement. Wang&#39;s application meets the legal conditions of personal safety protection order. Ruling: It is forbidden to perform family violence on Wang; prohibit Li from harassing, tracking, and threatening Wang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The typical significance of this case is expressed as: &quot;The harm of mental violence is not lower than the harm of physical violence. In this case, although the respondent has not been assaulted, harm, etc. Humanity causes physical injury, but its self -injury and self -harm behavior will definitely cause the applicant to have nervous and fearful emotions, resulting in the applicant&#39;s mental not free, so as to act according to the respondent&#39;s will. This behavior is mental violence. &quot; It is also home violence to hurt yourself to control the other party. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Theoretically, this case should be established in the following rules: Anyone in the husband and wife uses one cry, two troubles, and threatening to the other party. The injury to self -harm is to ask the other party to meet their specific requirements (whether the requirements are reasonable or not), and they will implement spiritual control/mental violence/domestic violence, so the other party will get judicial relief. Of course, it is necessary to ensure that men and women enjoy the same judicial protection and new rules for the integration of men and women, respect the principles of equality between men and women&#39;s rights and equality of each party and each party. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In social media, this case has been concerned, discussing and questioning. It is necessary to ask questions: What is the man who threatened the woman by jumping from the building and drinking pesticides to the woman&#39;s unit. What is the threatening content? In the basic case, only the expression of &quot;controversy between the two parties often occur due to family chores.&quot; From the &quot;frequent controversy&quot; to the man&#39;s &quot;self -harm&quot;, there is a process of upgrading the contradiction. How is this upgrade completed? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The title of this case is: &quot;Wang&#39;s application for personal safety protection order -threatening to others by self -injury and self -harm to others&quot;, the set keywords are &quot;self -harm, spiritual, spiritual spirit, spiritual spirit control&quot;. From self -injury, self -harm to mental control/mental violence/home violence logic chain is: one party said, &quot;If you do not agree with my request and do not follow my will, I will hurt myself&quot;+this means that the other party &quot; &quot;A nervous and fearful emotions&quot;, which leads to the other party &quot;unwillingness&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; There are two points or worth further discussions. First, according to this logical chain, one party&#39;s many different types of &quot;language violence&quot; should also be identified as spiritual control/mental violence/home violence, because the other party will &quot;have nervous and fear emotions&quot; and lead to the other party &quot; Style is not free. &quot; For example, through habitual, persistent complaints or derogation, derogatory and humiliated remarks, the personality, dignity and achievement of the other party will be degraded to reduce the self -evaluation of the other party, so as to better control the other party; Put forward ridiculous or harsh requirements, exaggerated or false allegations to the other party, forcing the other party to abandon their rights and self -esteem, and hand over the control of property and income to control each other in spirit and property. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Back to the above cases, some netizens&#39; questions are: &quot;Disputes between the two sides often have controversy due to family chores.&quot; In the dispute, does the woman perform &quot;language violence&quot; or mental violence to the man? If the man unilaterally continuously performs mental control/mental violence/domestic violence through self -injury, why not sue to divorce? In the current judicial practice, domestic violence is a very fully divorce complaint. From the previous details, the necessity of maintaining this marriage cannot be seen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; From this, you may wish to think about it: In the relationship between lovers or husbands and wives, one side is injured and self -harm. Does the other party need to be responsible for this? The answer is self-explanatory. Because the self -injured and self -harm, as a person with full capacity for civil behavior, as an adult who has a good spirit, should bear the responsibility and bear all the consequences of their own behavior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2021, a case in Inner Mongolia sentenced a case, which caused huge controversy. Prosecutor&#39;s allegations: On September 28, 2020, Er Moumou drove his car to visit his wife to see his daughter in Tongguer Pastram, Bayanhot Town. During the vehicle&#39;s driving process, it suddenly jumped behind the car door after opening the vehicle by the vehicle. After landing, he died of severe brain injury. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Media reporting is more specific: The man drove his wife to see his daughter over 3 years old. The two on the road have been quarreling because of the problem of &quot;eating hot pot&quot; ... The wife said that she just wants to eat hot pot now and does not want to see the child. The man insisted on seeing the child first. The wife saw that her husband did not turn around the car to take himself to eat hot pot. After angry, he made an unexpected move: when the vehicle was still driving, opened the door to jump. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the end, the court believed that the man was &quot;too confident&quot; to cause one person to die, which constituted the crime of death and death. The problem is that the woman did not have any warning before jumping. According to the rules and jumps established in the above -mentioned typical cases, jumping is like jumping from the building and taking pesticides. It is a self -injury and self -disabled behavior. I should also know the consequences of my behavior and do not make the other party responsible. Article 66 of the Road Traffic Safety Law also stipulates: passers -by ... must not affect the driver&#39;s safe driving behavior. It is impossible to establish such rules and law: In the relationship between husband and wife, one side self -injury and self -harm threatens the other party. No death is to perform spiritual control/mental violence/family violence on the other party. criminal responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Further, the only correct rule is that adults rather than anyone else should be responsible for their behavior. &quot;Strive to make the people feel fair and just in every judicial case&quot;, then judicial practice should be reasonable, consistent and systemic through the rules and laws presented by each case, so that the people will have stable expectations and expectations and stable expectations and Fairness and justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 18:25:17 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“并案处理”应被精细化对待丨法眼]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261628]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-30 17:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/30/Lazyzv4X2ZMZMCA5US0HEL7XM29DDGTCULYOSKR5.JPG &quot;Border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 960 &quot;height =&quot; 640 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm /medias/ims/ims/im Age/23/11/30/Lazyzv4x2ZMZMCA5US0Hel7xm29ddgtculyoskr5. jpg &quot;data-key =&quot; 260149 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999; text-align: center; &quot;>; In the&quot; Sweeping Evil &quot;operation, cases often occur in cases. The picture shows on October 28, 2019, the public security organs in Wuhu City, Anhui Province held a special fight for the special campaign of &quot;sweeping and eliminating evil&quot;. &lt;span style = &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (People&#39;s Visual/Picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In criminal cases, a case often takes its own set of litigation procedures. However, under special circumstances, &quot;handling&quot; will also occur, that is, multiple cases will be merged together. According to relevant regulations in my country, public security organs, people&#39;s procuratorates, and people&#39;s courts can be handled in accordance with the relevant regulations of the same person, the people&#39;s procuratorate and the people&#39;s court. The original intention of handling the case is to make judicial staff more efficiently handle the case, and it has also produced good results in practice. For example, it can better discover the truth of the facts, ensure consistency of sentencing, and the efficiency of litigation can generally be improved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In recent years, there are hundreds of giant cases that have appeared in cases of anti -evil, anti -telecommunications fraud and other cases. Instead, some new problems have been exposed, and it is urgent to pay attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Unprecedented systems and practice &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; From the perspective of my country, the case of China and the case of the lack of criminal proceedings is clearly stipulated, and the provisions of the judicial interpretation are low. The specifications are too general and other defects, resulting in the system in judicial practice not only inadequate authority, but not strong operability, which will inevitably affect the rights and interests of the parties after the handling . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first is not enough protection for the parties. Public, prosecution, law and other case -handling agencies have a greater decision to decide whether to merge the case and how to do the case. Sometimes, some case handling agencies bring their own case handling needs into decision -making. Whether the case can be handled and how to deal with the case often depends on whether it can make the case handling more convenient, and whether it affects the rights of the parties very little. This has led to the same parties in the same case in practice. The rights he should have when he was not merged, and it was sometimes difficult to realize after the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For example, some of the case processing will have the common evidence, and some evidence that is originally used in a certain case will be used by another case. Some parties often make innocent confession in order to get rid of their allegations, but these confession may contain information that proves guilty of others. When the case was not handled, once the defendant obtained the innocent judgment, he was only a witness in other cases. At this time, he could have refused to appear in court to accuse other defendants by reasons such as testimony. However, during the handling of the case, he essentially had the identity of the defendant in the two cases. In the confession, the evidence that others were guilty could be used in the whole case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Second, the party&#39;s program selection right is not affected. With the continuous development of negotiated criminal justice, my country&#39;s criminal proceedings have given the parties the right to voluntary choice in some special procedures. In the case of meeting specific conditions, the parties can choose whether to apply a simple program and a quick layout procedure, or make a judgment on whether to appeal. However, when the case is handled, these options will be affected. According to my country&#39;s current lawsuit rules, the application of these two procedure diversion mechanisms shall be consent from all the defendants. When there are differences between the defendants, some of the defendants who want to trial as soon as possible may not be able to adopt simple procedures or fast -tailor proceedings. Similarly, in my country&#39;s criminal proceedings, the second instance procedure also stipulates that as long as some defendants appeal, as long as some defendants appeal, they should review the entire case and handle them together. The defendant who does not have the willingness to appeal will force the second instance to enter the second instance procedure because of other defendants. For these defendants who have no appeal, they could have obtained the effective judgment after the first trial, but the mandatory second trial procedure extended the time they waited for the judgment. During this time, they will suffer because the final judgment is full of uncertainty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Third, the case without a limit will affect the quality of the case. In practice, sometimes there will be a huge case of dozens or even hundreds of defendants. Compared to the split into multiple cases, giant cases need to be coordinated between more parties, and more time to take up in preparation procedures and trial procedures. Weighing also requires more energy than ordinary cases. Improper handling will have a negative impact on the quality and results of the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Fourth is the time that may delay the case handling. The Criminal Procedure Law did not clearly stipulate the calculation of the later period of the case. The judicial interpretation only provided in principle the issue of the period of consolidated trial. Cases that requested that &quot;the trial may cause excessive delay&quot; should be avoided. But in fact, what extent is &quot;excessive delay&quot; without operating standards. Some case -handling agencies are not efficient in work, and they are more willing to delay the duration of the lawsuit. They will use more surplus cases as the basis for the newly incorporated case. This leads to the approaching period of the case handling of the previous case, and some cases handle the case will use the newly incorporated case as a reason for the extension of the case handling period. In this way, the case handling has become a means of extending the case for handling cases. Unfortunately, the current system handling system has not yet identified and regulated it. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; The refined system promotes refined practice. &lt;/H4>; &lt;p>; In order to make the merger processing better play its original value, it is necessary to improve it under the existing institutional framework. We believe that the treatment of merger should focus more on the protection of the rights of the parties, to be reasonably split on giant cases, strictly restrict the case handling period, and give more space for the parties to choose more procedures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; First of all, pay attention to the protection of the rights of the parties. my country&#39;s merger treatment is dominated by public power, and some unreasonable phenomena have occurred in the rights protection of the parties. To change this situation, we need to make efforts from two aspects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the one hand, it is necessary to ensure that the parties have the same rights when dealing with the case. The International Criminal Court&#39;s &quot;Procedure and Evidence Rules&quot; stipulates that the parties shall enjoy the same rights when the consolidated trial cases. Inspired by this, my country is necessary to emphasize that regardless of whether or not or not or not, the parties have the same rights in the lawsuit — reduce. Regardless of whether the case or the case is divided, or the pursuit of other purposes, they need to protect the parties&#39; right to get fair trials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the other hand, we must establish the party&#39;s right to apply and improve the party&#39;s objection. In terms of application rights, in addition to the decision of the public power organs, it can also be initiated by the party&#39;s application. This allows the party&#39;s demands to be paid more attention. In terms of objection, we must seriously treat the parties&#39; objection to the procedure of the Case, and protect these objections to be expressed smoothly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Secondly, the right to give the parties more. In criminal proceedings, the long litigation procedure itself is a kind of torment and a punishment. In order to maximize the complaint, the parties can enjoy the right to the same choice when they are not merged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; First, we must emphasize the right to choose the compliance with the prosecutor in the pre -court meeting system. Since the substantive trial has not yet entered, the pre -court meeting can effectively solve and prevent some procedural problems. However, in the relevant judicial interpretation of my country, it has not emphasized whether &quot;whether there is any objections to the handling of merger and the treatment of the case&quot; belongs to the content that can be discussed during the pre -court meeting. The parties allowing the case to handle the case during the stage expressed their opinions on the handling of the case. If the prosecutor cannot reach a intention between the simple procedures, the fast -tailoring procedure, and the ordinary program, the possibility of discussing and consideration at the pre -court meeting stage may be discussed and considered in the case of the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The second is to explore the division of cases in the second instance stage of the case to deal with the case. In my country, not all criminal cases cannot be divided at the second instance stage. The Supreme People&#39;s Court stipulated in the judicial interpretation that there are many defendants &#39;cases, and some defendants&#39; criminal facts are unclear, insufficient evidence or new criminal facts need to be prosecuted, and the crime is not associated with other defendants in the same case. According to the case of the case, the second instance people can divide the case of the defendant.并案处理的二审规则可以参照该规定，当并案处理中出现与该条文相近的特殊情况时，也可以将无关联的被追诉人在二审程序中进行分离，以避免因为“部分上诉、全&quot;Case review&quot; has deprived the parties&#39; dominance of the right to appeal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Again, a reasonable division of giant cases must be split. When the cost of giant cases exceeds a certain amount of load, it may have a negative impact on the fairness and efficiency of judicial referees because it consumes too much judicial resources. To this end, two steps can be used to promote the reasonable division of giant cases from concepts to technology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first step is to clearly establish a sense of reasonable division of giant cases. Article 136 of the International Criminal Court &quot;Procedure and Evidence Rules&quot; stipulates that when the negative impact of the fairness of the case on the case is greater than that of the case, even if it is jointly charged, it needs to be tried separately. The concept of this division can be transplanted in Chinese judicial practice. The highest judicial organs can encourage the reasonable division of giant cases to conduct a rational division first trial under the guidance of the principles of fairness, efficiency and proportions under the guidance of the principles of fairness, efficiency and proportions, and gradually establish a giant case between the case handling agency and the personnel handling personnel. Reasonable subconsciousness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The second step is to improve the provisions of the reasonable division system in the relevant judicial interpretation on the basis of the aforementioned work. At present, the judicial interpretation related to the handling of the case does not specify the case and how to sub -case the case and how to share the case with the advancement of the lawsuit. Once the case handler decides to deal with the case and the case, even if an unreasonable giant case has occurred, it rarely adjusts the case. Therefore, it is necessary to supplement the relevant judicial interpretation, and the case handling authorities are required to be divided into cases after the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Finally, the time limit for handling and handling the case. In order to prevent the &quot;borrowing period&quot; of the case handling, it shall prohibit the extension of the case handling time in a formula, that is, the specification and case treatment cannot naturally lead to the extension of the case handling period. The procedures are extended. At the same time, the behavior of delaying the lawsuit in the name of the case in the name of the case is unreasonable, and the case handler should bear the corresponding case responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; (Author Liu Renwen is a researcher at the Institute of Law of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Qin Han is a lecturer in Zhejiang University of Technology) &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 17:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“基辛格不会有第二个，但基辛格的担忧却会不断重复”丨智库视点]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261631]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-30 15:11:44 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; According to media reports such as Xinhua News Agency, on November 29, 2023, local time, former US Secretary of State Henry Kisin Ge died at his home in Connecticut at the age of 100. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Just two months ago, Kissinger was still mediation of Russia and Ukraine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On September 24, local time, according to the Ukraine Trip, Ukrainian President Zeleizki met with former US Secretary of State Kissinger during his visit to the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The director of the Ukrainian President&#39;s Office Andrey Yeermack posted the above news on social media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Kissinger visited China in July and also attended the Bund Financial Summit online on September 23. The Southern Weekend has launched the &quot;Confusion of Russia and Ukraine, Centennial Kissinger&#39;s achievements and controversy | Think Tank Viewpoint&quot;, which is now pushed to show commemoration. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Why is Kissinger still active &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Today the world is facing huge risks, which is different from all risks after the Cold War. The previous risks, whether they were sold in Afghanistan or Iraq, have occurred between the world&#39;s great powers and small and medium -sized countries, and the possibility of risk upgrades is not much. This time, it became a counterpart between the world&#39;s great powers and a strategic confrontation that occurred between nuclear powers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the one hand, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the Big Western game behind it have a strong impact on the world order after the Cold War.俄乌冲突标志着冷战后世界秩序面临严峻的挑战。另一方面，这也是俄罗斯与美西方阵营之间在冷战后的第一次间接对垒。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据叶尔马克的描述，基辛格在会面时对泽连斯基说，“在这场战争之前，我反对乌克兰加入北约，因为我担心这会启动我们现在看到的进程（冲突爆发）。现在，这一进程已经达到了这种程度，在这种情况下让乌克兰保持中立的想法已不再有意义”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这已不是基辛格第一次提及乌克兰加入北约。 5月17日，《经济学人》刊发了对基辛格专访的内容，基辛格接受采访时表示，他支持乌克兰加入北约。他还说：“乌克兰应继续受到欧洲的保护，而不是成为一个靠自己保护自己的孤立国家。”对于俄罗斯，基辛格则说，“如果我跟（俄罗斯总统）普京谈，我会告诉他，乌克兰留在北约，他也会更安全。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对俄乌冲突，基辛格呼吁各方坐下来开展外交谈判。他警告说，如今存在着这样一种风险，即大国军事关系主导了他们的地缘政治考量。俄乌冲突因此可能会发展成一个全球冲突，外交谈判将“愈加重要”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另一方面，中美关系从特朗普时期开始发生质变，冲突开始替代合作，成为中美关系中的主题词。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，以中美俄关系为代表的世界大国间关系，已经非常危险。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在此背景下，基辛格对中美关系越来越忧虑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据新华社6月16日报道，基辛格在接受媒体采访时表示，中美关系正处在“悬崖之上”，“目前的关系轨迹必须改变”。后来，基辛格又称，中美冷战如今“正走在山路”上。基辛格认为，中美“双方都确信，对方构成一种战略威胁。我们正在走向大国对抗”。这是一个“不应该继续”的进程。中美之间一旦发生冲突，将堪比第一次世界大战。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此基辛格积极斡旋俄乌冲突、拖着老迈之躯访问中国，就是试图在稳定中美关系再发挥余热。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;为何是基辛格？ &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在美国，有影响的战略家也不少。对国际局势感到忧虑，试图推动俄乌关系、中美关系改善的人，也不在少数。但为何是基辛格，而不是其他人？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一方面，基辛格对美国有一种迷信式的崇拜和使命感。 As a German Jew who escaped the Nazi regime, to hold a high position in the United States is an example of an American success story. This also makes him always grateful to the United States.他曾经写道：“在其他任何地方都找不到同样慷慨的精神和没有恶意的东西。”这种对美国的近乎感性的感谢与崇拜，使得他在外交上不惜一切地服务于美国，致力Maximize the national interests of the United States.为此，他不惜牺牲个人的信仰，也不顾个人的毁誉得失，达到“苟利国家生死以,岂因祸福避趋之”的高度。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另一方面，基辛格的外交成就，半数以上在中美关系方面。 Kissinger is an eyewitness and operator of America&#39;s transformation from decline to prosperity. If President Nixon had not accepted his suggestion, destroyed the Sino-Soviet alliance, and shifted the strategic focus of the United States from Asia to Europe, it would have been difficult for the United States to win the Cold War in this way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在他进入美国政坛时，美国正经历二战后的最低谷，同时经历对外战略、经济和社会三重危机。美国陷入越南战争不能自拔；经济困难，美元失去兑付黄金的能力和信誉；国内社会混乱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在基辛格离开美国政坛的时候，美国已经成功地把中国从美国的敌人转化为美国对抗苏联的“友好的非盟国”。美元虽然不再能与黄金自由兑现，但重新与石油贸易绑到一起，实现了从美元向国际本位货币的升级。美元从世界经济贸易的中介，变成了真正意义的霸权货币，变成了国际本位货币。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些都使得基辛格具有独特性，是外交界的神话与传说。 His status and influence in international politics, especially in Sino-US relations, are irreplaceable. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;时代的象征&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2023年6月16日，据新华社报道，基辛格在接受媒体采访时说，美国政治极化，眼下“过分关注”自身利益，其外交政策如果无法平衡美国和全球的利益，美国“将变得孤立”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当年中美关系从敌对转向合作，根源是两国都必须应对来自苏联的威胁。但是，如果没有基辛格的见识与胆略，中美关系也很难在那种恶劣的双边关系状况中，迅速重启。这种个人与时代重叠互动所产生的符号效应，是任何其他人都无法具备的。基辛格已经成为一个符号，一个时代的象征，具有不可重复性。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从历史上来看，那是中美两国困难时期，团结抗击苏联的时代产物。基辛格秘密访问中国时，正是苏联的上升期和强硬期，是中国和美国的困难时期。中美实现跨越太平洋、跨越意识形态鸿沟的握手，不仅造就了一段外交传说，也稳定了当时的世界局势，也提前注定了冷战的结局。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当年基辛格到中国来，就是看到中国与苏联之间的战略矛盾和意识形态分歧，要联络中国共同对抗苏联。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在这个意义上，中美两国也因此成为冷战结束的最大受益者。冷战结束以后，中美两国都得以摆脱安全顾忌，减少安全负担，专心发展经济。中国在世界的崛起，以及美国在西方阵营内部的崛起，交相辉映。可以说，站在中美关系和世界格局的转折点上，是基辛格的个人幸运。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从个人层面来看，基辛格经常被称为是一个现实主义者，主要是因为，他把战略思维置于意识形态前面考虑。 This distinguishes Kissinger from the current strategic researchers in the United States who are guided by ideology. However, he did not take ideological factors into consideration.事实上，他把自己的对外政策原则，称为“自由的国际主义”，相当于小布什时期的新保守主义，是把强调价值观、国际主义原则与基于国家实力的外交结合起来的产物。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也正是因为这种自由的国际主义，让他得罪了特朗普和拜登两位美国总统。 On November 25, 2020, Trump fired Kissinger from his position as an advisor to the U.S. Defense Policy Council.但是，他对拜登从阿富汗撤军也不满意，认为这是一种不负责任的行为，背叛了从威尔逊总统以来的美国对外政策传统。 One result of expressing this rhetoric is that Biden inherits Trump&#39;s approach to Kissinger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，美国战略界人才辈出，比基辛格年轻一代的战略界人士，很多也已经退出舞台。美国中青代战略人才，现在已在美国挑起大梁。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是，年龄是基辛格一大优势。基辛格已经100岁了，已经超过了他的所有朋友和对手。基辛格是世界上唯一百岁高龄还在积极活动并具有重大影响的国际政治家。 This makes Kissinger&#39;s role largely unrepeatable. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;基辛格可否复制？ &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;基辛格是时代的产物。时代不可重复，基辛格就不可复制。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一方面，中美关系的形态变了。冷战时期，中国和美国的最大外部威胁都是苏联。中美为了自身安全，建立起跨意识形态鸿沟的准同盟体系，符合自身的利益。现在，随着中国史无前例地走入世界权力舞台的中心地带，中美关系也成为最重要的一对双边关系。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另一方面，外交的时代特征已变。基辛格所代表的现实主义者，崇尚个人因素，迷信秘密外交。这在冷战结束的时候，就已经落伍了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;基辛格一生执迷于那个激情燃烧的岁月，陶醉于从巴基斯坦秘密坐上飞机前往北京的惊险与刺激。在后冷战时代，尤其是在高度透明和公开的自媒体时代，这些个人英雄主义的外交行为，都是难以再现的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实上，基辛格在美国的影响，衰落得比在中国要快得多。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在新的时代背景下，很多美国人对基辛格曾经的贡献和功绩，也在进行反思与挑战。著名国际关系学者汉斯·摩根索早就说过，基辛格像荷马史诗中的奥德修斯那样，“有许多立面”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在美国，对基辛格有两种描述：一是骗子，这个人从来没有讲过真话，从来都讲模棱两可的话，几乎从来不对重大事件公开做明确的评论，这可能是他在国际关系界百年长青的秘诀之一。二是基辛格是记忆力绝佳的惊世之人。他是许多重大事件的亲历者和活字典。克里斯托弗·希钦斯对基辛格的描述也许更为准确，称基辛格为“记忆力绝佳的惊世骗子”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后，有一点非常危险。与主要成就在冷战时期的基辛格相比，现在的美国战略家们，基本都是在和平氛围中成长起来的。对于他们来说，和平不再是国际政治的首要目标，而是国际政治的前提或背景，是不需要争取和付出代价的。所以，我们可以看到，与基辛格对冲突前景的担忧相比，很多美国战略家似乎对冲突的可能性，并不放在心上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以，基辛格不会有第二个，但基辛格担忧的危机，却是会不断重复的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（作者系复旦大学美国研究中心教授）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p >;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 16:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[西藏阿里全体公务人员为一女子献血？应以令人信服的证据消除特权嫌疑丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261624]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 14:57:06&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;上海一女子在西藏出车祸大出血，其亲戚通过上海卫健委联系阿里地区，发动全体公务员为其献血？近日，这一消息在互联网引起极大关注，网民们纷纷质疑背后是否存在特权问题。尽管当事人不断否认有亲戚是公职人员，但许多网友并不买账。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据新京报等媒体报道，近日一自称小余的女子在社交媒体发布短视频，说自己蜜月自驾游到西藏阿里地区时发生严重车祸，肝脏破裂，失血严重，有Danger to life.她丈夫的小姑姑通过上海市卫健委联系西藏阿里地区，协调上海援藏医疗专家为其进行治疗，还发动了阿里地区“所有公务人员”包括派出所民警、消防官兵、部队官兵为其献血，最终用7000多毫升血，将她从死亡线上拉了回来。随后，她又通过医疗包机转运到四川华西医院进一步救治，在伤情稳定后又从四川回上海继续治疗。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;视频很快引起极大关注。很多网民质疑“小姑姑”是何方神圣，竟然能让上海市卫健委调动援藏医疗专家，还能发动阿里地区所有公务人员为其献血，是不是有利用特权的嫌疑？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;引起极大舆情后，当事各方都接受媒体采访作出了回应，否认存在特权干预。不过，这些回应未能消除大众的疑问。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先是“小姑姑”到底是何许人。余女士丈夫陶先生后来对媒体说，他小姑姑不是上海公职人员，是在妻子车祸后当地相关部门建议向上海卫健委求助，平时关系密切的小姑姑才“想办法”联系到上海卫健Division.而上海卫健委则表示，当时他们是接到了“相关部门”函件，请求正在西藏日喀则市的援藏医生前往当事医院参与救治，此事不存在因私人关系等不正当因素导致的行动。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;可见，这个小姑姑确实能够联系到上海卫健委，还能让“有关部门”给卫健委发函。在一般人看来，一个普通市民，恐怕最多也就能打个卫健委的热线电话，因此“小姑姑”难免让人生出疑问。上海卫健委有必要作出更多说明，到底是接到了哪个部门的函件，该部门也有必要进行解释。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其次，余女士后来被用医疗包机从阿里送往四川成都华西医院救治，医疗包机的费用不菲。她父亲说，他们是普通家庭，包机费用120多万，钱都是从亲友、领导处借的。但这一说法也令人生疑。花百十万包机从西藏撤回内地更好的医院，虽然是为了挽救女儿的生命，但短期内要筹集这样一笔巨款，也不容易。据余老先生说，他是“在单位开车的”。这样的单位，这样好的领导，引起很多网友实名羡慕。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，网友们最关心的，还是到底有没有发动“全体公务人员”为她献血。陶先生后来说，当时妻子刚刚做完手术，伤势依然很重，这么说是为了鼓励妻子打起求生意志，实际上是医院的工作人员在朋友圈和群里发消息，希望有好心人去献血，自己也联系了当地派出所、消防等部门，希望得到他们的帮助。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;阿里方面政府工作人员则表示，确实有干部职工为受伤女子献血，但不是官方组织的，而是看到相关消息后自愿去献血。阿里医院工作人员也称，血库库存告急后，是医院向职工、社会人员求助，家属也向当地多个部门求助，后来有不少人来献血，其中有几十名公职人员。前述政府工作人员还表示，阿里地区医疗条件相对落后，血液库存本来就很紧张，如果有人求助，很多干部职工都会自愿献血。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上海游客在西藏出车祸，上海、阿里两地相关部门通力合作，一边协调援藏专家救治，一边自愿献血救人，终于将重伤游客救回，这本来应该是一个感人s story. However, because of a short video, it caused a great wave of questioning privileges on the Internet.究其原因，是因为公众见过了太多以权势谋私利的不公平现象，也见过了太多网上炫富炫权而不经意间暴露了腐败问题的事件。而余女士发布的短视频，可能也给人一种炫耀“小姑姑”能力（也就是炫耀自己家的能力）的感觉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以，怪不得公众会怀疑这里面有特权，如果想让大家相信这是一个纯粹的感人的事件，涉及的各方，尤其是牵扯到的官方机构，应该拿出更多令人信服的证据。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[查理·芒格逝世 “我没有什么要补充的了”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261619]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/65rPbMhQMAk6Wb5LlOGb5rwNujlbtMcUqyWfR7Dm.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2019年5月3日，美国内布拉斯加州奥马哈，伯克希尔·哈撒韦公司首席执行官巴菲特（左）和副主席芒格&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（视觉中国/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“比大多数人少一些疯狂和愚蠢”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;距离100岁生日还有一个月，查理·芒格在加利福尼亚州的一家医院里与世长辞。沃伦·巴菲特永失挚友，世界又少了一位幽默而桀骜的智者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;99岁的芒格是沃伦·巴菲特的合伙人。 1978年以来，他一直担任伯克希尔·哈撒韦公司副董事长。过去的四五十年间，二人联手将伯克希尔从一家摇摇欲坠的纺织品制造企业打造成为史上最成功的跨国企业集团之一。该集团的子公司已覆盖保险、铁路运输、能源、制造、零售和服务等多个领域，持有的股票价值超过3180亿美元，其中约半数为苹果公司股票。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;两周前，芒格曾接受CNBC记者贝基·奎克的采访。相比半年前的股东大会，他的思维依然敏锐，陈述观点时喜用长句，声音却愈发沙哑难辨。躯体的局限是智识无法冲破的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;奎克问起他当前有什么特别想做的事情，得到了否定的回答。他的手已经无法像年轻时那样感知不同的鱼咬钩时钓鱼线的拉力。他不再执着地要将“钓一条200磅（注：约90公斤)重的金枪鱼”从人生清单上划去。 “这需要太多的体力。即便现在有机会，我也不会前往，我甚至不会去追击他们。时间总会让你放弃。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与96岁时相比，他正愈发频繁地觉察到身体的衰老和虚弱。面对奎克的问题，他说自己不再有计划。对于各种变化，他都能“欣然接受”。接受采访时，他坐在洒满阳光的庭院里，身旁的草坪边摆着一排红掌，又称花烛。这种花色泽鲜艳，花期持久，从绽放到枯萎会先后呈现出米黄、乳白、绿色和黄色，各具特色。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/QlY37KH7E81EYH1sOkTaiqbGA2Cmb0CkWmOADdgm.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;芒格始终认为，他和巴菲特得以拥有出类拔萃的职业生涯的重要原因，是有足够长的时间保持在场，但“复利”的魔法得以施展的前提仍然是“比大多数人少一些疯狂和愚蠢”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;芒格1924年1月1日出生于内布拉斯加州奥马哈市。他从小酷爱阅读，尤其对传记着迷，有极强的逻辑思维能力。作为优秀毕业生从哈佛大学法学院毕业后，芒格延续了祖父和父亲的衣钵，在洛杉矶开启了律师生涯。随后，为了获得比资深律师更多的收入，芒格开始依托既有的客户资源，开展律师业务之外的投资，并创建了自己的投资合伙公司。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/mp7jsMBqiHAWf10KmMJXxXhIPShRxI9hoGZ1sDuV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;959&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/mp7jsMBqiHAWf10KmMJXxXhIPShRxI9hoGZ1sDuV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260228&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;1988年3月9日，芒格在美国加州&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（视觉中国/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1959年，芒格的父亲去世。回乡料理后事的他在朋友安排的一次晚宴上结识了29岁的沃伦·巴菲特，相差6岁的二人一见如故。在巴菲特的建议下，芒格1965年起开始全力经商。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;两人互为知己，也促成了彼此人生道路的重要转折。巴菲特曾表示，是芒格的思想力量拓展了他的视野，让他“以非同凡响的速度从猩猩进化到人类”，否则他会比现在贫穷得多。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;职业生涯之初，巴菲特是本杰明·格雷厄姆的忠实信徒，后者被称作“价值投资之父”。格雷厄姆主张找到那些以低于营运资本的价格出售的公司股票，便宜购入，待股票价格上涨后抛售，并留有足够的安全边际。这些“便宜而不受宠的股票”被他比作“烟蒂”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/DgBzqofMqcGvRNWJU3WDvArA4pJap8FglGpU91EU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1592&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/DgBzqofMqcGvRNWJU3WDvArA4pJap8FglGpU91EU.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260227&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;《芒格之道》&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而推动巴菲特投资哲学向前演化的关键力量正是芒格。芒格认为，格雷厄姆的投资策略建立在未来“更多是危险，而不是充满机会”的假设上，可实际上投资股价公道的伟大公司远比投资股价超低的普通公司要好。受芒格思想的影响，巴菲特逐渐从格雷厄姆理论的局限中走了出来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他们发现，有的股票虽然价格是其账面价值的两三倍，但仍然是非常便宜的，因为该公司可能正处于增长的通道上，拥有非常优秀的管理人员，或者整个管理体系非常出色等等。通过对资产负债表、社会和经济潮流等的详尽分析，巴菲特和芒格从浩瀚的股市中探测出了被他们视作“复利机器”的优质股票。长期持有这些股票会带来超额的利润回报，这些资金将被用于再投资。巴菲特把这个过程比作“滚雪球”，“只有找对了雪地才可以滚雪球”，“一边前进一边选择积雪皑皑的地方，让雪球越滚越大。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;自1965年到2022年年底，伯克希尔的年复合收益率为19.8%，57年来的总回报达到近3.79万倍，远远跑赢同期标普500指数的表现。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“如果没有查理·芒格的灵感、智慧和参与，伯克希尔·哈撒韦就不可能发展到如今的地位。”芒格去世后，巴菲特在声明中这样写road. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/O7v0oHkL2z4eLmMxBbVRqU7G2xtdZwWNS8lw4ThR.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;根据福布斯的数据，截至2023年11月28日，芒格的净资产约为26亿美元。然而，相比其难以复制的财富人生，更让普通人受益的还是芒格的思维模式。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;巴菲特将芒格称为“世界上最优秀的快速思考者”。作为股票的挑选者，巴菲特会通过芒格的质疑来测试自己的想法。 “他能一下子从A想到Z，甚至在你话没说完前，就已经看到一切的本质。”这种洞察力的背后是芒格久经训练的思维方法，被他称作“多元思维模型”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;芒格在公开场合多次谈及在商业世界和现实生活中使用“多元思维模型”的价值和重要性。比如在作出投资决策前，他会对意向公司的内部经营状况及其所处的更大的整体“生态系统”做全面分析，所以他总能在“60秒内找出令人信服的弱点” . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据芒格估计，他脑海里储存的多元思维模型多达百种。这些模型会帮助他收集和处理信息，并在此基础上提供决策指导。这些模型需要借用并糅合各个传统学科的分析工具、方法和公式，包括工程学的冗余备份系统模型，数学的复利模型，工程学的断点，物理学和化学的倾覆力矩、自我催化模型，生物学的现代达尔文综合模型，以及心理学的认知误判模型等等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/CmTkpEB3YqZ184Ju7dBlvWVXmJpC6Sg8ZqUNmcab.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1525&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/CmTkpEB3YqZ184Ju7dBlvWVXmJpC6Sg8ZqUNmcab.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260224&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;《穷查理宝典》&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所谓的“直觉”背后，其实是一场漫长思维旅途的终点，是芒格对人类行为、商业系统和其他跨学科长期研究的产物。他主张“迅速歼灭不该做的事情，接着对该做的事情发起熟练的、跨学科的攻击，然后，当合适的机会来临——只有当合适的机会来临——就采取果断的行动”。他喜欢将自己的生活视作一场教育实验，“一个很好地掌握了自己专业的人，在非常广阔的学术领域，试验这种基本治学精神和方法的可行性和有效性。”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在芒格看来，获得智慧并不只是为了让个体的生活变得更加美好，更是一种道德责任。 2007年，他在南加州大学古尔德法学院毕业典礼的演讲中提出了这个观点。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在演讲中，他还提醒年轻的毕业生们“要避免极端强烈的意识形态”，“尤其是那种以非常激烈的方式表达出来的意识形态”，因为“它只给人灌输一些观念，而不是让人心悦诚服地接受一些道理”，“这无异于将大脑禁锢在一种非常不幸的模式中”，“这样你们的头脑就会坏掉，而且有时候是以惊人的速度坏掉。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了帮助自己在偏向于支持某种强烈的意识形态时保持清醒，芒格设定了一条“铁律”——“只有能比对手更好地反驳我自己的立场时，我才有资格拥有一种观点。”当然，这条“铁律”不仅限于避开强烈意识形态的漩涡。芒格认为，这种思维方式值得不断训练，唯有不断证伪和拷问自己，才能减少自己的无知。在他看来，或许更适合作为意识形态的是“准确、勤奋和客观”的精神。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与之相对，灾难性的思想状态则包括“妒忌、怨憎、仇恨和自怜”。芒格曾经历过人间至痛。 1953年，和妻子离婚后不久，他的大儿子泰迪罹患了致命的白血病，当时骨髓移植手术尚未出现，泰迪很快因绝症而死去。在朋友的回忆中，那时在医院探望完儿子，29岁的芒格常常会痛哭着走在街头。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;多年之后，芒格告诫年轻人，“过度自怜可以让人近乎偏执。偏执是最难逆转的东西之一。每当你们发现自己产生了自怜的情绪，不管是什么原因，哪怕由于自己的孩子患上癌症而即将死去，你们也要想到，自怜是于事无补的。”然而，不同的人生阶段总是会遇到非常棘手的难题，他的建议是：期望别太高；拥有幽默感；让自己置身于朋友和家人的爱之中。 “最重要的是，要适应生活的改变。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为一个富裕而高寿的智者，芒格最常被问到的是“如何才能变得幸福和富裕？”在他看来，生活不仅仅是精明地积累财富，生活和生意上的大多数成功来自那些应该避免的事情，比如过早死亡和糟糕的婚姻。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/qxt9znRMzJc1X9gzp3gXf67kE7UzJkseFJjzmsKJ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;639&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/qxt9znRMzJc1X9gzp3gXf67kE7UzJkseFJjzmsKJ.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;他还有另一个答案——“每天起床时，争取变得比你从前更聪明一点。认真地、出色地完成你的任务。慢慢地，你会有所进步，但这种进步不一定很快。但这样能够为快速进步打好基础……每天慢慢向前挪一点。到最后——如果你足够长寿的话——大多数人会得到他们应得的东西。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;82岁时，芒格的朋友送给他一本由本杰明·富兰克林出版的《西塞罗论美好人生》，书中包括一篇西塞罗《论老年》的译文。受这篇文章的启发，芒格写下了《歌颂长者：芒格论晚年》一文。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;文中，芒格摘录了这位出生于公元前106年的智者的一段总结：“晚年的最佳保护铠甲是一段在它之前被悉心度过的生活，一段被用于追求有益的知识、光荣的功绩和高尚的举止的生活；过着这种生活的人从青年时代就致力于提升他自己，而且将会在晚年收获它们产生的最幸福的果实；这不仅是因为有益的知识、光荣的功绩和高尚的举止将会陪伴他终生，甚至直到他生命的最后一刻，也会因为见证了正直的人生的良心和对过往美好功绩的回忆而给灵魂带来无上的安慰。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;芒格的一生正是对此的最佳阐释之一。和他乐于效仿的本杰明·富兰克林一样，他始终拥有旺盛的求知欲和广泛的兴趣，他始终在创造、给予，然后被铭记。他悉心度过了饱满的99年，正如他在伯克希尔年会上的口头禅：“我没有什么要补充的了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;（参考资料：《穷查理宝典》《芒格之道》。）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[糖分摄入过多有危害，上海试水含糖饮料健康提示]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261576]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“3元羽绒服”上热搜：不是买不起还是感冒药更有性价比]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261501]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;最近，关于羽绒服的讨论热度高涨。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“羽绒服何时卖到五位数的”“国产羽绒服卖到7000元”……几千上万的羽绒服频频登上热搜榜，慢慢地成为了冬日“奢侈品&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而在不久前，“3元钱的羽绒服”引起了网友的关注和讨论，显示3元但实际售价仅35元的低价羽绒服给寒冬里的普通人送来了最温暖的礼物，对于他们来说，比起大牌奢侈品，能用够用足矣。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随着小雪节气已至，各大城市步入冬季，很多人翻出了压了一年箱底的保暖神器——羽绒服，有数据显示，超半数网民在需要时购买羽绒服，双11期间，羽绒服成了各大电商平台的热销品，很多国产羽绒服登上天猫热销榜，收获了不少好评。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其实，国产羽绒服的崛起离不开背后厂家生产综合实力的提高，而长江三角洲是羽绒生产的主力军。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在江苏、浙江、山东，与羽绒相关的公司数量均超过一万，不少国产羽绒服品牌逐步开启转型之路。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;面对五花八门的羽绒服品牌和类型，很多网友说急需一套科学的挑选指南。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先，要看羽绒服填充物：鹅绒因绒朵大而饱满，蓬松度好，保暖性强，使用时间长等因素会比鸭绒更贵。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其次，真正起到保暖作用的是绒子，绒子含量更直观反映羽绒服品质。值得注意的是，不是越厚重越保暖。蓬松度越高的羽绒服，隔热的空气越多，保暖作用越好。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从数据来看，选择千元羽绒服的网民还是少数，大部分网民更追求性价比。正如网上常常看到的那句话：不是羽绒服买不起，而是感冒药更有性价比。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;你会选择什么价位的羽绒服？今天，“知道”就和你一起看看怎么挑选高性价比的羽绒服。 &lt;/p>;
