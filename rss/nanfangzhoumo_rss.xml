I don&#39;t know when. A saving trend is taking over social media. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;How hard can young people of this generation work to save money? It can be said that only you can’t think of it, but there is nothing young people can’t do. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Contemporary people’s new hobby: don’t consume, save money like crazy&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;span>;In Between going to work and making progress, this generation of young people choose incense; between buying bags and getting drunk, they are more likely to choose to buy lottery tickets; between ideals and reasons, financial management is the favorite of young people - the main thing is One saves money and makes money! &lt;/span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Douban&#39;s &quot;Living with Interest: Savings Group&quot; now has more than 100,000 members in the group, &quot;Living with Interest: Investment and Financial Management&quot; group , the number of team members exceeds 600,000. Not to mention the &quot;Stingy Women&#39;s Association&quot; and the &quot;Stingy Men&#39;s Association&quot;, with a total of millions of people joining the groups. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In order to save money, some people choose to keep accounts and plan carefully, some choose to live with interest, manage finances and buy funds, and some choose to do both their main business and side business, and become a slash youth. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;When using the accounting APP, sorting out personal bills regularly is just an entry-level step. Learn from the collective wisdom of various money-saving groups and discover various wool-gathering artifacts, shopping red envelopes, Membership discounts, point deductions, live group buying, multi-platform price comparisons, and resolutely not letting go of any hidden benefits are the new life wisdom that young people get. For example, there are young people who squat after midnight every day to grab expired food and leftovers. boxes to reduce the cost of food expenses. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;These can be regarded as an evolved version of actions for young people, and students at higher levels have already started playing special forces to save money. Compare banks across the country to see whose interest rate is better. Higher, choose to travel thousands of miles to go. Some media reported that after bank interest rates were lowered this year, some young people traveled 2,000 kilometers a day and spent 330 yuan on fares just to earn an extra 1,800 yuan in interest. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Some people feel that this is too unfair to themselves. The reason why young people are happy to live in peace with the &quot;hard life&quot; is that there is a high probability that saving money is like a snowball, and seeing themselves The small treasury is getting fuller day by day, and the sense of accomplishment can, to a certain extent, make people forget the hardships in the early days. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As the Japanese writer Yataro Matsuura once wrote in &quot;Getting Rich Slowly: Money and Work Rules to Make Your Life Richer&quot;: &quot;It is easier to save money than to spend it. After all, there are many ways to spend money, but there is only one way to save money, and that is to &#39;spend less&#39;.&quot; Because the path is single and clear, as long as the goal is firm enough and you continue in the established direction, you will always succeed. Realization, and therefore, attracts more and more young people to join the game. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Rejecting the trap of consumerism, young people have truly become sober in the world. I am no longer obsessed with following trends and buying the latest electronic products; I no longer order takeout frequently, but choose to go to the market with the aunts to buy food and bring my own meals; I no longer have to take a taxi every time I walk, but can walk. Walk, take the subway and never take a taxi. The money saved at every step is like a trickle, which eventually converges into a stream or a river. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/db7bc1d8642781493c9860d7666c2e84.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;721&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/db7bc1d8642781493c9860d7666c2e84.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253558 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo&amp;nbsp;/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt; span>;Saving money, can you save money&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;So when it comes to saving money, to what extent do young people hope to save money? A report shows that more than 53.7% of 30-year-olds believe that saving 100,000 yuan can be regarded as having a certain basis for savings. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;However, the cold reality is that a survey by China Business News shows: with a deposit of more than 100,000 yuan, you have already surpassed 53.7% of your peers. More than half of young people have less than 100,000 in savings, and it is a reality that they are &quot;powerless&quot;. Young people who are trying their best to save money find that money is like fine sand. The tighter you hold it, the more it will be lost. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The road to financial freedom is full of thorns. However, the will of young people is gradually firming up, and they are no longer attracted by the lavish spending of consumerism. Instead, they do not want to buy and save everything, and everything is compromised for the enrichment of their small coffers. What social trends does it reflect that young people are working hard to save money? Some people&#39;s ambition to save money is to retire early and implement a FIRE plan (Financial Independence, Retire Early); others are saving money for more security and more confidence to cope with the future. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After all, the greater the balance, the greater the sense of security. Money means having enough protection against unknown risks. It can help young people live without panic and ask for help less when encountering problems. In the final analysis, it is essentially due to the inherent risk aversion. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As Ulrich Beck said in &quot;Risk Society&quot;, life risks are always present, and individuals are forced to face the individualization process, which is constructed in the early modernization stage. The security system can no longer provide protection for individuals, and individualization has therefore entered a new stage. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Increased social mobility, the increasingly blurred boundaries between unemployment and employment, the disintegration of clan-based family relationships, work and intimate relationships, all of which are unavoidable issues for this generation of young people. Making young people aware of risks also inspires their desire to cling to something stable when the wave of risks strikes, so as to seek peace and tranquility in their own years. But before the dawn of dawn, money becomes the coordinate axis of reality, and saving money is the magic weapon for young people to resist risks. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;If you think that young people save money without spending it, you are totally wrong. Different from the older generation who simply save money, young people focus on saving money and spending money when they should. In this Houlang’s value perception, saving money is to spend money better, to spend money wisely, and to pursue a higher sense of value and cost-effectiveness. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Bill Gates once said: &quot;It is as difficult to spend a sum of money wisely as to earn it.&quot; Therefore, if you feel it is worthwhile, travel to see the world and learn New skills and new experiences are worth saving money to achieve. However, if you feel that it is not worth it, such as a takeaway meal that has increased in price, or expensive ugly clothes in the mall, then you are not willing to pay extra for it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Young people who often surf the Internet have given various &quot;painless money saving&quot; methods a new title, naming them &quot;Princess Money Saving Method&quot; &quot;365-day money saving method&quot; &quot;Muyu money saving method&quot;...&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Even in order to increase the sense of ritual of saving money, when achieving the goal, you will appropriately increase yourself Rewards, such as saving 50 yuan a day and saving up money for a concert ticket in three months, will not affect your normal living standards, but at the same time, you can satisfy your hobbies and interests, just like making a coin-operated wish, in the wilderness of life Here, brave people are at the forefront, enjoying the world first and creating their own unique style and lifestyle. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Bulk up your wallet and enrich your life. Are you in love with this young generation’s view on saving money? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 11:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[主持人实名举报，法院12368热线能不能外包？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258377]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-11 11:13:55&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Host Zhang Zequn.

(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 7, 2023, CCTV host Zhang Zequn reported to the Chaoyang District Court in Beijing with his real name on social media. He said in multiple updates that the court&#39;s 12368 litigation service hotline was outsourced, and &quot;the staff did not know what a collegiate bench was, and there was dereliction of duty.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Immediately, Zhang Zequn’s report became a hot search topic, attracting the attention of netizens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporters found that outsourcing of the court’s 12368 hotline is relatively common. According to a cursory search, dozens of courts at the provincial, municipal, and county levels across the country , there is a phenomenon of public bidding for hotline outsourcing services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some netizens raised questions about the functions, responsibilities and positioning of the 12368 hotline. What is &quot;12368&quot;? Can it be outsourced? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In order to meet the multi-level and diverse judicial needs of the people, the People&#39;s Court has established a 12368 litigation service hotline and vigorously promoted the &#39;one-stop service&#39; work.&quot; Supreme Court Liu Xuemei, deputy director of the filing division of the People&#39;s Court, once told the media that as of the end of 2022, all four levels of courts across the country had opened a 12368 litigation service hotline, helping to resolve an average of 59,000 claims every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;As of the end of 2022, all four levels of courts across the country have opened litigation service hotlines, and an average of 59,000 claims have been resolved every day.

(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Send a work order to the judge”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Public information shows that &quot;12368&quot; is the number determined by the Supreme People&#39;s Court. Judicial information public welfare service number common to the national court system. Beijing is the first pilot area for the &quot;12368&quot; judicial service hotline, which was officially opened on January 7, 2009. The &quot;Beijing Court 12368 Hotline&quot; has set up a main platform in the Beijing High Court, and has set up sub-platforms in all middle and grassroots courts. Six courts, namely Dongcheng, Xicheng, Chaoyang, Haidian, Fengtai and Daxing, have set up direct dial lines and do not need to be forwarded through the Municipal High Court&#39;s main platform; calls from other court sub-platforms will be uniformly answered and accepted by the Municipal High Court&#39;s main platform, and will be forwarded according to the situation of the call. The case shall be handled by the lower court on separate platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to the &quot;Rule of Law Daily&quot; report in 2021, the 12368 direct sub-platform of Xicheng Court consists of 5 lines, and staff will receive more than 200 calls every day , looking for judges, investigating cases, answering questions, receiving opinions, making demands, etc. According to the relevant person in charge of the Beijing High Court, if parties call the 12368 hotline to ask for simple matters such as checking the progress of the case, submitting applications and materials, and procedural litigation consultation, the hotline will &quot;answer the lawsuit&quot; as soon as possible and give a direct reply; If the exercise of judicial power or matters closely related to the case require a response from the judge, the hotline will issue a work order to the judge, who will handle it in a timely manner within the specified time limit to ensure that the contact rate of the judge reaches 100%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Zequn reported to the Chaoyang Court 12368 hotline. On October 8 and 9, 2023, Southern Weekend reporters called the hotline several times to inquire about the &quot;collegial panel&quot; and hotline outsourcing. On one occasion, the operator responded that he could ask the judge about the legal terms and the circumstances in which they appeared, and he would give a reply within two days. Another time, the operator replied that 12368 is mainly responsible for registering complaint information and cannot directly handle complaints. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another call occurred at around 8 pm. The artificial intelligence voice assistant provided a self-service intelligent voice query service. When the keyword &quot;Collegial Court&quot; was mentioned , gave a more detailed answer. However, artificial intelligence voice assistants may have unclear or inaccurate hearing from time to time, and if there is a semantic recognition error, they will continue to output large sections of legal or procedural regulations and cannot be interrupted manually. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The role of 12368 focuses on information consultation.&quot; A lawyer surnamed Liu told a Southern Weekend reporter that the customer service line of the 12368 hotline mainly relies on the query system. No special professional answering ability is required; more professional questions related to court functions can mainly be completed by calling the legal aid hotline 12348 or going to the court case filing window. Lawyer Liu often interacts with courts and does legal knowledge popularization work on Internet platforms in his spare time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He also introduced that many parties involved in the case have little contact with the court and do not understand the existence of 12368. In contrast, lawyers entrusted by parties are the group who have more contact with the 12368 hotline. For lawyers, 12368 is mainly used to understand the progress of the case and to inquire about other channels for detailed consultation. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Outsourcing is more common&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;April 2023, Beijing The &quot;Beijing Higher People&#39;s Court 12368 Hotline Litigation Platform Service Fee Project Winning Announcement&quot; published by the Municipal Government Procurement Network revealed that China Mobile Online Services Co., Ltd. won the bid for &quot;Beijing Higher People&#39;s Court 12368 Hotline Litigation Platform Service&quot; at a price of 7.74972 million yuan. &quot;Fees Project&quot;, the service period is 12 months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Introducing the &quot;overall model&quot; in the announcement, the 12368 manual hotline service adopts the access model of the main platform of the High Court and the sub-platforms of the middle and grassroots courts to provide the society with 5× 8 hours service. The bidder provides workplace wiring services, as well as operation team recruitment, training, management, call quality inspection, callback, etc. The number of seats in the operation team shall not be less than 65, and there shall be no less than one full-time call quality inspector. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to media reports, in 2022, the number of manual calls to the Beijing Court’s 12368 hotline reached 1.4942 million, a year-on-year increase of 67.2%, ranking first in the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;You will know after going to the court a few times to do things. They really have a lot of things to do and are very busy.&quot; Wang Cailiang, director of Beijing Cailiang Law Firm, once organized lawyers to go to the court. The &quot;Legal Aid Hotline 12348&quot; of the judicial system provides free consultation. He explained to Southern Weekend reporters that it is very common not only in the court system, but also in some government agencies and institutions to outsource hotlines involving legal issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He said that if normal bidding procedures are followed, this kind of outsourcing behavior is not a bad idea. The key is that the legal professionalism of the outsourcing unit must be excellent so that it will not be criticized by the outside world. &quot;If you are not professional, wrong and knowledgeable, you will not be able to satisfy the masses,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Many people are unwilling to do consultations and receive public consultations.&quot; Wang Cailiang explained that staff in some units regard receiving public consultations as a kind of burden and therefore tend to outsource this work. He believes that communication and consultation are originally good opportunities to resolve conflicts. If used as a burden, conflicts will accumulate and expand, thus consuming more judicial resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporter&#39;s search found that the outsourcing of &quot;12368&quot; is common in courts at all levels across the country, but the specific bidding details vary greatly. Due to different levels of economic development, the business volume of courts in various regions varies greatly, and the contract amounts therefore vary significantly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For example, a provincial high court in an economically underdeveloped southern province issued a bidding announcement in July 2023, which showed that its “12368 litigation service hotline outsourcing The project&#39;s budget is only 600,000 yuan; while the contracting budget of another large city district court in March 2023 reached 1.5 million yuan. In addition to the separate bidding model for each court, a province in East China has adopted a model of &quot;provincial centralized deployment and social outsourcing of the 12368 litigation service hotline of the province&#39;s courts&quot;, with an overall budget of more than 24 million yuan, requiring intelligent voice, intelligent work orders, Intelligent agent assistance and a unified litigation service knowledge base empower the core engine, open up the litigation service system, and realize the entire process of consultation, inquiry, appointment, and processing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The contract period of these outsourcing services usually ranges from 1 to 3 years, and subcontracting and subcontracting are expressly prohibited. Among the winning bidders, state-owned enterprises and private enterprises It’s both. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Currently, there are no regulations that clearly allow or prohibit outsourcing.&quot; Wu Liwei, a lawyer at Beijing Beidou Dingming Law Firm, often calls the court hotline because he needs to check the progress of the case. Consultation was conducted, but I felt that many outsourcers did not understand legal issues. &quot;Since it is a litigation service hotline, it is to facilitate parties, lawyers and other people who may be involved in the lawsuit to understand relevant legal issues and litigation processes. From this function, internal court personnel should be responsible for answering calls and answering questions.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, Wu Liwei also believes that outsourcing the court hotline may involve leaking privacy. He explained that lawyers and clients often need to call the hotline to inquire about the progress of the case. Although the specific details of the case will not be involved, the &quot;cause of the case&quot; itself contains a lot of private information. &quot;For example, who files a divorce lawsuit against whom, and who sues whom for defamation, insult, or damage to reputation, all involve the privacy of the parties concerned.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[误认家长为人贩子被打：一场基于双向误解的冲突]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258369]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-11 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A few days ago, a netizen told an experience of his on social media, which caused widespread attention and controversy. The blogger herself described the version as follows: She said she had a &quot;fracture on her face&quot; and was beaten by her parents because she felt her parents looked like human traffickers. She then had a sense of justice and finally the two parties went to the police station. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She wrote: At the police station...it was said that I hit him with a pole first, and then he hit me. In fact, I just followed them from beginning to end, constantly asking the little girl: &quot;Kid, is he a member of your family?&quot; Once or twice I tried to gently hold her hand to confirm with her what the relationship between this man and her was. The little girl didn&#39;t say anything, and I didn&#39;t dare to confirm whether he was a trafficker, so I kept delaying time and told him to stop and not leave. My purpose was to wait until the police came to investigate clearly. He was too fierce, and I was afraid that he would beat him. I. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then he was really beaten: Later, when he walked near his car, he suddenly put down the child, turned around and punched me on the head several times... and broke the handle (of the camper) with all his strength. He hit me on the head with the broken end of the metal handle...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On this Weibo, there are those who sympathize and support, but also those who ridicule and ridicule. Of course, what we can see so far is the blogger’s unilateral perspective and description, which may not be accurate or complete. To understand the full truth, the media should interview the other party or ask the local police for information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the subject of the facts described by the blogger is true, that is, he is well-intentioned, suspects that the parents are human traffickers, and then follows them, talks to the child, and &quot;once or twice tried to gently hold her hand.&quot; &quot;Hand&quot;, because the child kept silent, &quot;I had to keep stalling for time to tell him to stop and not leave.&quot; This is one party’s perspective. What if we look at it from the perspective of the child’s father? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a father, he carried his child to a private car. Suddenly a stranger appeared and was following me. He also approached the child and kept saying incomprehensible words. He also tried to touch his child and questioned whether he was the child&#39;s biological father. A normal reaction would be to get angry. When he got near his car, he felt that the child was safe, so he decided to teach the other party a lesson, letting the child know that his father would protect him, and venting his anger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It should be said that protecting one&#39;s children is a normal reaction of any parent. If strangers continue to behave in this way, parents with children will see it as provocation or bad intentions. As for children not answering strangers&#39; questions, it is normal. They may be introverted, or they may not want to talk to strangers of unknown origin due to safety education at school or at home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is rumored that in order to snatch children from their parents, one of the tricks used by traffickers is to snatch the children from their parents when the parents are not paying attention, and then lie to passers-by that they are the parents of the children, or Lie that it is a dispute between husband and wife and snatch the child, in order to dissuade passers-by from intervening, so that passers-by will be less willing to intervene. And these urban legends (Urban Legends) actually have their roots. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A father posted a video introduction. On the evening of July 13, 2023, his wife took her child out to play. A woman directly tried to snatch the child. Fortunately, she was not far from the child and stopped her in time. &quot;The woman She kept telling others that she was her child, but the people around her didn’t dare to interfere. Later she tried to run away, but I restrained her.” According to a local police report: The woman involved had a history of multiple medical treatments for mental illness. Although the woman was proven to be mentally ill and not a trafficker, she used the phrase &quot;it&#39;s her child&quot; when she robbed the child. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also sane people who snatch children from others in public. On December 17, 2019, Ms. Wang and her mother came to Shanghai Station with their 2-year-old twins, preparing to take the bus back to their hometown in Zhengzhou. When they were resting at the southeast exit of the station, a middle-aged woman pushing a stroller and wearing a black coat picked up her little daughter and prepared to leave in public. Ms. Wang and the surrounding passengers hurriedly stopped the woman and immediately called the police. The woman lied that she &quot;had the wrong hug.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Going back to the case at the beginning of the article, the logical chain may be that the woman believed that the child’s father was a suspected human trafficker; conversely, the child’s father probably also regarded her as a suspected human trafficker or mentally ill, which led to A conflict based on misunderstandings on both sides. The starting point of the blogger involved is worthy of recognition, but in fact, when an adult walks on the street holding a child, from the &quot;prior probability&quot; (prior probability), the probability that it is a parent holding their own child is still extremely high. At the same time, there is no reason why it is normal for parents to have close interactions with their children anytime and anywhere. If the child who is being held cries and screams and says he wants his mother, he clearly says &quot;Who are you? I don&#39;t know you, I want my mother.&quot; That&#39;s indeed a bit suspicious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This incident also reminds us that it is a good thing to have love and a sense of justice, but we should proceed from common sense and rationality, based on reliable judgment, and on the premise of safeguarding our own safety; when we meet the real In suspicious situations, do not directly conflict with the other party. It is best to use legal means to solve the problem. Of course, acting bravely should be encouraged, but it must be objectively true, such as stopping an ongoing crime. If you misjudge the nature of the matter, you are actually infringing on other people&#39;s personal freedom and reputation rights, which will inevitably lead to the consequences of misjudgment and wrong actions. This is the revelation beyond what is right and what is wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[最高人民检察院依法对殷美根决定逮捕]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258375]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-11 10:05:59&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;The reporter learned from the Supreme People’s Procuratorate today (11th) that the former deputy party leader of the Standing Committee of the Jiangxi Provincial People’s Congress The case of secretary and deputy director Yin Meigan suspected of accepting bribes was investigated by the National Supervisory Commission and transferred to the procuratorate for review and prosecution.

(Southern Weekend reporter Zheng Dan/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A meal for 9 people, 13 dishes, and the average cash per person was 72 yuan. Wiping his mouth and getting up, another day passed by. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;68-year-old Hong Jianming stood in front of the neon-lit hotel lobby, watching old friends walking in twos and twos, supporting each other across the zebra crossing until they disappeared. He took steps in the darkness across the road. “They don’t know that I live nearby, and I don’t want them to know.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;They are single old men whom Hong Jianming met at the IKEA restaurant in Xujiahui, Shanghai. In order to &quot;eat more diverse dishes&quot;, we get together to eat together every Tuesday. Neither of them knew each other&#39;s names, and they seldom asked because there was no need. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Most of the single elderly people who go to IKEA restaurants want to find a companion. While they boldly express their love for the person they like, they can&#39;t help but be suspicious and wary out of self-protection, lest they suffer a loss. As time goes by, everyone has become acquaintances who maintain a sense of boundaries, and they get together just for fun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Loneliness is the background here after all. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Private land&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Lack of a communication platform for the elderly&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text- align: left;&quot;>;It is rainy in Shanghai in early autumn, but the IKEA Xuhui Shopping Mall at No. 126 Caoxi Road is bustling with people. On the afternoons of Tuesdays and Thursdays, the young people dining in the restaurant on the second floor slowly dispersed, and crowds of elderly people poured in. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At 3 pm on September 12, 2023, Southern Weekend reporters first arrived at the IKEA restaurant. At first glance, the dining area with nearly 700 seats was scattered. It was completely occupied by elderly people sitting apart, and there were always people walking around in the aisles, chatting with each other. Occasionally, someone walks up to the reporter, looks at the new young face and asks: &quot;Are you here to see some company?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This is a place where the elderly in Shanghai spontaneously Set dating angle. Xuhui Mall, opened in 1998, is IKEA&#39;s first store in mainland China. It&#39;s hard to explain how its restaurant came to be occupied by a group of singles. As long as you buy a cup of coffee for 7.9 yuan and get free refills, you can hang out in the restaurant with the mug in hand all day long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;71-year-old Chen Cuixia remembers that 18 years ago, the Xuhui shopping mall was still a small two-story building. She and her six sisters came to play as a single person. I walked around the mall and found that there was food on the second floor. &quot;It&#39;s pretty good here. Let&#39;s talk about it after it&#39;s over. How about we come back next time?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Later, more and more people gathered together. At the most, More than 300 single elderly people gathered here, all looking for companionship. The entire hall had to rely on shouting to communicate, &quot;the sound was so loud that it could knock off the roof.&quot; Someone suggested that everyone pick a day to get together. Tuesday is the big day and Thursday is the small day. Chen Cuixia feels that the elderly actually have no other place to chat&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;“Except here, it is the People’s Park, and there is a lack of a platform for the elderly to communicate.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Shanghai is the super-large city with the highest degree of aging in the country . According to the 2022 Shanghai Municipal Elderly Population and Aging Care Monitoring and Statistics Information, there were 5.5366 million registered elderly people aged 60 and above in Shanghai in 2022, accounting for nearly 40% of the total population. Among them, the number of elderly people living alone 300,600. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;IKEA restaurant has undoubtedly become a private place for them to relieve their loneliness. Every Tuesday, a 90-year-old old lady takes bus No. 456 from Sanlin. After spending more than 40 minutes arriving at the restaurant, she just sits silently in the corner and watches the crowds of people; The wife treated her like a sister, so she packed some pumpkin seeds in a plastic bag for the old lady to eat. The two have known each other for four or five years since they met in the restaurant. When asked if they were looking for company, they shook their heads and said, &quot;Just chat, as long as Allah (in Shanghai dialect, we) are happy.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Guicheng Coming from a farther place, he sets out from Fengxian District every Tuesday and takes two and a half hours by bus and subway. He comes here to chat and eat, and then goes back. He loses 70 to 80 yuan a day, just because he is lonely. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The 71-year-old is a matchmaker in Shanghai People&#39;s Park. He has worked for decades, but now he is also facing the dilemma of not being able to find a partner. &quot;Dating for the elderly is the same as dating for young people. They are all about business. Are your conditions good? How much money do you have?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Guicheng said, it is the same as all dating angles. , the most important condition here is also money. Everyone&#39;s opening remarks are nothing more than a few questions: Are you from Shanghai? How old are you? Have children? Is there labor insurance (retirement pension)? Have a house? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A 65-year-old old lady told Zhang Guicheng that she wanted a gift of 500,000 yuan. Zhang Guicheng also asked her this set of questions: Is there labor insurance? No; do you have a house? nor. Zhang Guicheng couldn&#39;t hold back a word, &quot;You have nothing, why would anyone give you 500,000? You just don&#39;t want the gift, and no one wants it from you.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>;Contempt chain&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Old ladies and old men will lose money in getting certificates&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot; text-align: left;&quot;>;On the surface, the people who come to the IKEA restaurant are all wealthy elderly people, and bright gold jewelry is the most indispensable decoration here. Most of the men wear short-sleeved shirts and a bunch of keys on their waist belts, which makes them look well-behaved; those who are more individual like to wear a peaked cap upside down and stand up the collar of their short-sleeved shirts; a man often wears a brightly colored suit. The clothes, with big logos and patterns on them, reveal his wealth. He said he has had seven or eight girlfriends here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Women have also mastered the secrets of fashion. Sunglasses, silk scarves and cheongsam are all necessary items to enhance their temperament. There are also people who attract everyone&#39;s attention with their slender figures and use black masks to cover their wrinkled faces, giving them a sense of mystery. Another woman in her sixties from Gansu wears a purple top hat with huge flowers sewn on it. She speaks softly and smiles. However, because she is a foreigner, she has not found a partner yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/50a46731bf.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;743&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/50a46731bf.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253622&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 21, 2023, two women over sixty took a group photo at the IKEA restaurant in Shanghai. (Southern Weekend reporter Zheng Dan/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As long as you spend an afternoon in an IKEA restaurant, you will clearly feel the chain of contempt among the elderly dating circle. Shanghai men with houses and high pensions are the most popular here. If you are more particular, you can also classify people from various districts in Shanghai into different grades. As for women, young and beautiful Shanghainese are the hot commodity, and some pensions are the best. Outsiders, regardless of gender, are at the bottom of the contempt chain and will be suspected of having ulterior motives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Past lessons tell the old people here that there are all kinds of &quot;traps&quot;. According to the old people&#39;s stories, there are men who dress in gold and silver and lie about how rich their family is just to sleep with the woman they &quot;took&quot;; there are women who claim they are in good health, only to expose their full body after they get together. Because of her illness, her male partner had to take her to the hospital every day; young women from other places often came to this place to &quot;talk about friends&quot; with single Shanghai men in their eighties or nineties with no children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Song Xiaofei is the &quot;confused person&quot; that everyone calls &quot;the trick&quot;. He is an 80-year-old old Chinese medicine doctor who is thin and has a slimy food residue at the corner of his mouth. Wang Xiumin, who is in her 40s, sits opposite him and peels longans for him. The two got together just a few months ago. Due to the huge age gap, they treat each other as father and daughter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Song Xiaofei receives a monthly pension of 8,000 yuan, which is quite high in a restaurant. All the pensions were given to Wang Xiumin for safekeeping. Song Xiaofei would receive 50 yuan of pocket money every day, which he would put into the interlayer of the veteran&#39;s preferential treatment certificate and used to buy cigarettes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Xiumin said that she felt sorry for Song Xiaofei&#39;s experience. Song Xiaofei has experienced three failed marriages, and his first wife made him suffer for 18 years. After the two divorced, the woman&#39;s natal house was allocated to Song Xiaofei. This house was divided into half during the second marriage. After the third marriage ended, the house was completely divided. Now Song Xiaofei can only rent a house in Shanghai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The third wife is Song Xiaofei whom she met at an IKEA restaurant&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>; &quot;She said she owned three houses. We got a marriage certificate, but later we found out that she didn&#39;t own any of them.&quot; Song Xiaofei divorced decisively and became alone again. &quot;The third one has a very bad conscience. Now I want to find someone with a good conscience.&quot; Song Xiaofei looked at Wang Xiumin next to him, &quot;She has a pretty good conscience.&quot;&lt;span>; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Xiumin described Song Xiaofei&#39;s experience as a cow turning into a sheep, the sheep turning into an egg, and finally the egg shell was gone. Song Xiaofei smiled after hearing this, &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter, I see clearly. As long as I have been around, it will all be in vain if I leave.&quot;&lt;span>; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In order to avoid falling into the &quot;trap&quot;, the most common way for the elderly is not to get a marriage certificate or transfer the name on the real estate certificate . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the past, Wang Liren talked about a beautiful female companion in a restaurant. &quot;We got along pretty well at first, but then she asked me to put it on the real estate certificate. Her name. I said if I don’t have a son, all three houses will be given to you after my death, but I have a son.”&lt;span>; &lt;/span>;Finally, considering that the two had already slept together, Wang Liren gave his female companion 2,000 yuan as compensation, and the female companion clutched the money and left angrily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;No one wants their property to be divided in their old age. &quot;If the old woman and the old man don&#39;t have a good negotiation, they will lose money in getting the certificate! For example, if you have 500,000 yuan and want a divorce, you have to give her 250,000 yuan.&quot; A man raised his eyebrows and said that he was old &lt;span>;to&lt;/span >; said in a tone that he had already seen through the group of women in front of him. The woman on the side was not happy to hear this. She even supported the popular saying: Love without the purpose of marriage is a hooliganism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some people take the example of a successful couple in a restaurant: the man&#39;s financial conditions are not as good as the woman&#39;s, but his pension is high, so he gives all his pension to the woman and lives in the restaurant. Entered the woman&#39;s home. A few years later, the two of them did not get a marriage certificate, and their relationship was still good. &quot;It&#39;s enough to have company with each other, even if we don&#39;t get a certificate, we can live the same life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Loneliness&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot; I sold myself for my son”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Lao Zhang, a frequent customer in the restaurant, is also a famous &quot;confused person&quot; in IKEA restaurants. Some elderly people describe him as Being a &quot;bad guy&quot; (a dialect word for fooling around) also ruined the atmosphere of the restaurant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He is 78 years old and has lost all his teeth. He relies on the friction of his gums with black roots to eat. He can only eat mashed potatoes and liquid food, and chew a small bite of fried food. The chicken steak needs to be chewed slowly for seventy or eighty times before it can be completely swallowed. The soft chin moves the loose skin of the neck up and down, and the heavy gold chain flashes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Everyone used to call him the &quot;little tailor&quot;, which was a label for his poor days. When he was working in a garment factory, he had no money, so he would spend the night in a bathhouse near the factory. But 8 years ago, due to the demolition of his old house in Shanghai, Lao Zhang received 5 million demolition funds, became rich overnight, and more and more women began to surround him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Lao Zhangtu was cheap and spent 1.5 million to buy two 92-square-meter houses in Qidong, Jiangsu. Almost every half month, he takes away a female companion from the IKEA restaurant and takes a bus back to Qidong to look at houses. He calls such women &quot;temporary workers.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;I spend money to buy someone to accompany me, take care of me, cook for me, wash clothes, 200 to 1,000 yuan a day.&quot; Lao Zhang said, he Prices will be based on age and appearance. The younger and more beautiful the price, the more expensive it will be. &quot;The younger ones are in their forties (years old) and want to sleep together and cuddle&quot;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;48-year-old Shen Sufen is the &quot;temporary worker&quot; called by Lao Zhang. She served Lao Zhang for a period of time, earning 300 yuan a day. One time, I went to Lao Zhang Qidong&#39;s house. The smell was overwhelming. The things in the refrigerator had been there for a month or two. They were all packed and brought back by Lao Zhang after eating out. The ceiling was almost covered with mosquitoes and moths, and Shen Sufen spent three days cleaning it up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;My daughter doesn&#39;t care about me, she&#39;s busy.&quot; Every two or three months, my daughter will come to see Mr. Zhang and give him a wad of 3,000 yuan in cash. Zhang squandered all the money on his three major hobbies in life: coffee, mahjong and women. &quot;It&#39;s lonely every day, but having someone by your side will at least make you richer.&quot; In fact, what Lao Zhang is most worried about is that if one day he falls ill, there won&#39;t even be anyone around him to call 120. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/ca8bf0b00a. jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/ca8bf0b00a.jpg&quot; data-key= &quot;253623&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023 On September 20, Lao Zhang was going to take a bus from Shanghai back to Qidong.

Some of the old people are living for the next generation. And abandoned by the next generation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For a long time in the past, there was a beautiful woman in the restaurant who was looking for a companion. She was born in 1975. There was no restriction on the age and appearance of the man she was looking for. The only condition is to give her two million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The reason for making such a request is because my son is getting married soon and there is not enough money to collect. As long as you have 2 million yuan, you can buy a house and a car in your daughter-in-law&#39;s hometown, and you can also pay for the lottery gifts. The woman said, &quot;I sold myself just for my son.&quot; Later, she became what the old people called a &quot;psychopath&quot; and never came back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Hong Jianming told another story about a single woman in Shanghai wearing a green dress who often hung out in restaurants. Ten years ago, her daughter asked her to help take care of the children at home. Now that the children have grown up, her daughter and son-in-law want her to live out. After several years of looking for a companion, no one wanted her, and she is still living at her daughter&#39;s house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;She told me personally that they had two bedrooms and one living room, and the house was large. When her daughter and her family all went to bed, she went in quietly, washed up, and went to bed. Don’t meet them.” As he spoke, Hong Jianming waved the woman over to chat, and the woman waved her hand. &quot;Her brain has been damaged. She has no other idea but to find an old man to take her home to live with.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Old Face&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style =&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;If we can&#39;t become partners, at least we have a common topic&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After 5 o&#39;clock in the evening, the old people After getting up and going home one after another, 68-year-old Pan Yinhua chose a corner and sat alone. She laid out the cold steamed buns she brought from home, picked up a glass of hot water, and started to eat her dinner. “I don’t want to go back to that home and see He just makes a noise&quot;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He is Pan Yinhua’s ex-husband. It has been 10 years since their divorce, but neither one wants to move out of the house and they are still roommates. Pan Yinhua hopes to marry a Shanghai man who owns a house and then move out of that house. &quot;When I first got divorced, I just wanted to find a good and convenient one, so I divorced. I didn&#39;t expect it to be so difficult to find, and I was already discouraged.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;Once, Pan Yinhua and an 80-year-old man fell in love with each other. The man took her home and looked around, and Pan Yinhua was quite satisfied. &quot;But that house is not his, he only has the right to use it.&quot; Pan Yinhua could see that the man wanted to form a companion, &quot;But I think he is pitiful and has no children, and I just want to remain friends with him. He is old and has difficulties. Call me and I can help him&quot;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the end, the 80-year-old man was attracted by a Shenyang woman in her forties who came to the restaurant, and he rented out the house in Shanghai. I followed the woman back to the Northeast. &quot;If this woman has a good conscience, she can take care of him and live for two more years. If it costs a lot of money for the old man to fall down, she will definitely not spend it.&quot; In the end, Pan Yinhua was still worried, &quot;He can talk to me very well, you can He&#39;s a reporter, can you go to Shenyang to find this old man?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Everyone who frequents IKEA restaurants knows that finding a partner here is extremely difficult. The blind date of the elderly is quick and decisive. On the basis of &quot;well-matched&quot;, the role of companionship is far greater than love. According to the usual process, as long as there is a compatibility in the first meeting, it means that the first level has been passed. Generally, the man will take the initiative to invite the woman to visit his home. If the conversation is good, they will live together. If the conversation is not good, don&#39;t waste each other&#39;s time. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/0081db2f79.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/0081db2f79.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253624&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;At 21:00 on September 21, 2023, the remaining three elderly people were chatting at the IKEA restaurant in Shanghai.

Hong Jianming knew it was inappropriate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Often after the two parties chat for half an hour, Hong Jianming will politely send the other party to the subway entrance downstairs and tell her to go home slowly. But what Hong Jianming wants most is another scene of seeing off guests: &quot;I told her, go down by yourself. Do you know the way?&quot; This means that Hong Jianming is &lt;span>;favorite&lt;/span>; of the other person. &quot;I will tell her that she will come again in the future, so I don&#39;t necessarily have to pick you up at the subway station every time, right?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In order to be in my own When the person he likes appears, he shows his intentions.

Time pushed him into his twilight years, accompanied by intense loneliness, and there was no way around it. Facing the same old faces day after day, it is impossible to become a partner, so just chat with each other as friends.

Before the physical education class, a group of boys and girls in my son&#39;s class knelt down and prayed for rain, saying, &quot;God bless you, let it rain quickly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Kneel down and pray for rain&quot;, the first reaction in my mind is the plot in the TV series &quot;Journey to the West&quot;. A group of children knelt down to pray for rain in a serious manner. Of course I understood that there was an element of comedy in this, but I also realized an indisputable fact: some children do not like to attend physical education classes. On the one hand, the weather in Guangzhou is very hot. Running, skipping rope, and playing with hula hoops on the scorching playground for forty minutes is very painful or even torturous for most students; more importantly, some children There is a clear resistance to taking physical education classes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I can’t help but think of the time when I was in school more than thirty years ago. Physical education was, without a doubt, the most popular class, without “one”. During recess or physical education classes in elementary school, we would roll hoops, fold cards, play marbles, hopscotch, shuttlecock, and tug-of-war, and have a great time. Whether you come into the classroom with a red face after playing in the summer or warmed up after playing in the winter, it is always a very happy moment. In junior middle school and high school, before the class ends in the morning or afternoon, or before the physical education class, many of our classmates carry table tennis rackets. As soon as the bell rings, the students sitting in the back row of the classroom sprint at the speed of 100 meters. Running to the table tennis table and sitting or lying down on the table tennis table means &quot;we have occupied this table&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;PE classes at that time were synonymous with relaxation, happiness, and fun, which perfectly matched the playful nature of children. Times have changed, and today’s physical education classes are far less popular than before. Some students don’t like or even hate physical education classes. What is the root cause? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As we all know, the original intention of physical education classes is to strengthen children&#39;s bodies. The &quot;physical fitness&quot; here is not only about physical health and fitness, but also about cultivating the children&#39;s perseverance and fearless qualities. It has both physical and psychological implications, both of which are indispensable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to overeating, anorexia, other improper, unscientific, and unreasonable diets, or lack of exercise, or no exercise habits, many children are seriously out of shape, obese or suspected of being obese or weak. There are not a few children who are suspected of being weak. Out of shape will affect children&#39;s learning, social interaction and other aspects to a certain extent. As natural attributes, the body, body shape and body shape will construct and affect children&#39;s social attributes, usually with negative effects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to effectively solve or alleviate the above-mentioned difficulties and strengthen children&#39;s physical exercise, education authorities and schools have begun to pay attention to physical education. The importance of physical education in various subjects is increasing day by day. Not only weekly physical education The number of classes has increased significantly. In some provinces and regions, physical education classes have been officially included in the scope of entrance examinations, and physical education scores have been included in the high school entrance examination subjects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to achieve a higher overall score and not lose points along with the sports score, the original sports items as random or optional fun functions have been transformed into compulsory compulsory content for students. In other words, taking physical education classes is not to play, not to sweat, not to develop a lifelong habit of exercise, but to take the entrance exam and get a temporary score. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The original intention of including physical education as an examination item is to allow students to develop their moral, intellectual and physical development in an all-round way. The problem is that under such incentives, most students hope to get close to full marks or high scores in physical education. Many students In addition to physical education classroom training, students also spend a lot of time, energy and money on training for physical education examinations. Various expensive training courses, improvement courses and crash courses have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. There is no difference between these extracurricular training programs for major subjects such as Chinese, Mathematics, and English. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the school perspective, some areas have implemented a policy that links student physical examinations to the performance of principals, and therefore to the performance of teachers. Therefore, physical education classes and physical tests are not just a matter for the physical education teacher, but also a matter for all teachers in the school, involving the welfare and treatment of all teachers in the school. Under such circumstances, strengthening physical education classes, allowing students to strengthen physical exercise even when they return home, and doing everything possible to improve students&#39; physical test scores has naturally become a common choice for many schools. &quot;Using the whole school&#39;s efforts to develop and revitalize sports&quot; has become a goal of many schools. slogan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let students strengthen physical exercise. The specific exercise content is very specific and clear, including the physical test items required above. Students have to insist on punching in every day, and ignore other items at all, such as kicking shuttlecock, Projects that are interesting to students or more popular among students, such as hoop rolling and hopscotch, are basically excluded. In other words, the sports that students play in class may not necessarily be what they like. They have no right to choose. They can only passively accept several types of sports designated by the school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, some schools in some areas have also popularized activities designed to allow students to exercise for one hour a day - &quot;big break&quot;, which specifically includes free exercise, relaxation exercise, running exercise and other sections. The problem is that the evaluation criteria for this kind of &quot;big break&quot; are mainly beautiful formations, which require uniformity in an absolute sense. The row spacing, shoulder distance, arm raising range, left alignment, right alignment, and uniformity throughout the formation are not important. There are strict rules about not allowed to laugh and not allowed to make any sound. Students are forced to spend most of their &quot;recess&quot; time on superficial tasks such as formation rehearsals and pattern displays. Actual sports and exercise time are very limited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to win the &quot;big break&quot; competition, to come out on top in the gymnastics competitions of other schools, to gain greater honors, and to get richer bonuses, some physical education teachers in some schools go to great lengths. Use your brains and find ways to &quot;create&quot;. How to &quot;create&quot; is nothing more than working on the formation and making the movements more difficult. For example, inventing a &quot;flexibility exercise&quot; requires students to be proficient in difficult movements such as splits and lower backs. How? Only repeated training once and for all, this kind of high-intensity training brings huge harm to the students&#39; bodies, and some of the damage is irreversible. From a psychological point of view, most students will feel that practicing these innovative exercises is more boring, boring, and uninteresting, and it is extremely painful for them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned various innovative exercises wearing a fitness &quot;hat&quot; are more difficult and less interesting, and there are fewer practical exercises for students. As a result, if the school radio station broadcasts &quot;Due to ****** reasons, today&#39;s recess is temporarily canceled&quot;, bursts of cheers will be heard from every classroom on the entire campus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is obviously contrary to common sense, because not every student has the physical condition and talent to practice gymnastics, and not every student is suitable for doing difficult movements. This kind of training is only for professional gymnasts. It is really unreasonable to transplant standard machinery to ordinary students. The motivation behind this move - to win awards for the school and to increase the income of the school and some teachers, feels despicable and dirty, which is not an exaggeration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Standardizing and homogenizing sports, converting physical measurements into results and scores, and linking sports to the performance of school leaders and the pocketbooks of teachers have greatly reduced or obliterated the diversity of sports. The essential stipulations such as sex, diversity, and interest are used to alienate the children into tools for some people to pursue their political achievements. Such behavior is naturally not welcomed by the students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, we cannot oversimplify our understanding of students’ “kneeling down to pray for rain”. We cannot simply attribute it to the fact that today’s children are generally afraid of sweating, suffering, weak willpower, and weak ability to withstand stress. If you don’t like or even hate physical education classes, relevant parties should think about it in all aspects: Is the current function of physical education classes to strengthen your body, please your body and mind, or is it something else? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a professor at the Department of Sociology, Guangzhou University)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010; &quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 23:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[研究女性劳动力市场的女性，问鼎2023诺贝尔经济学奖]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258365]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 22:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/10/X0B4ScncQcKaw0hR2fkONFJQebCS37mC6nfK2fZl.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height=&quot;846&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/X0B4ScncQcKaw0hR2fkONFJQebCS3 7mC6nfK2fZl. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253618&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Claudia Goldin. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 9, 2023, Beijing time, Claudia Gore, professor of economics at Harvard University Claudia Goldin will win the 2023 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for &quot;advancing our understanding of women&#39;s labor market outcomes.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I studied Golding’s economic thought during my Ph.D., and in 2011 published “Review of Claudia Golding’s Economic Thought—Potential Female Nobel Economics” in Economic Trends &quot;A Review of the Academic Contributions of Academic Award Winners&quot;. Now I am very happy to see that she has actually won the award. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are traces of Goldin winning the Nobel Prize in Economics. She has served as president of the American Economic Association and the American Economic History Association, and has also been elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences. These important indicators of a scholar&#39;s academic status have long meant that Goldin has the potential to aspire to the top. The strength of the Bell Prize in Economics. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Uniqueness&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The 2023 Nobel Prize in Economics not only continues the common rules of previous years, but also has its own unique features. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, the winner Golding is still from an American university. More than half of the scholars who won the Nobel Prize in Economics from 1969 to 2023 were from the United States, far ahead of the number of winners from other countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Goldin was born in New York City in 1946. He received his bachelor&#39;s and doctoral degrees in economics from Cornell University and the University of Chicago. He has taught at the University of Wisconsin, Princeton University and the University of Pennsylvania. Now a professor of economics at Harvard University, she is the first female tenured professor in the history of Harvard University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, Goldin is the third female economist to win the Nobel Prize in Economics. When the Nobel Prize was first established, it did not include economics awards. Since the Nobel Prize in Economics was first awarded in 1969, male economists have always won this honor. Until 2009, Eleanor Ostrow Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize in Economics for &quot;innovative research in economic governance, especially in the governance of public resources.&quot; This is the first time a woman has won the prize. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ten years later, in 2019, Esther Duflo became the second female scholar to win the Nobel Prize in Economics. The reason for the award was for her outstanding contributions in the field of global poverty research. contribute. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third place is this year&#39;s Goldin. She revealed the main driving factors of gender differences in the labor market, which has far-reaching significance for understanding the female labor market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Interestingly, both Ostrom and Duflo shared the Nobel Prize in Economics with other scholars. For example, Duflo won the Nobel Prize in Economics at the same time with her husband, Abhijit Banerjee of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Professor Michael Kremer of Harvard University. Goldin’s husband, Lawrence F. Katz, is also an economics professor at Harvard University. The two have collaborated on many classic articles on labor economics and are a couple in the academic world. But it is a pity that Goldin and Katz were not able to share the Nobel Prize at the same time this time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, the research fields of the Nobel Prize in Economics are becoming more and more &quot;down-to-earth&quot;. In the past, the Nobel Prize in Economics focused more on theoretical contributions. In recent years, the Nobel Prize in Economics has gradually begun to focus on the applied value of research. For example, Duflo, the second female economist to win the prize in 2019, studied poverty. Golding&#39;s systematic research on female employment and gender discrimination, the history of educational development and changes in wage structures also has important practical significance. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Goldin’s research characteristics&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Goldin’s research not only focuses on the construction of a theoretical analysis framework, but also focuses on combining a large amount of economic history data to analyze Conduct research on real-life problems. Its research characteristics are to use a large amount of historical data combined with econometrics and other methods to conduct empirical research, and to analyze current problems through the perspective of the past in order to draw more practical conclusions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here, we quote two cases from Goldin, one is a study on women’s working time legislation in the United States. In the 1940s, 40 states in the United States passed legislation on women&#39;s working hours, setting mandatory maximum working hours for each day of the week. Many scholars believe that these laws not only fail to effectively protect these groups, but even harm their own interests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Golding used manufacturing data to conduct research and found that the maximum working hour legislation not only reduced the working hours of women, but also reduced the working hours of men, and the proportion of women in the manufacturing sector was also reduced. It has not been reduced due to restrictions in working hours laws. She also pointed out that the proportion of women in other industries such as sales has increased as working hours legislation has become more restrictive. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another example shows the skill of Golding&#39;s approach to researching problems. Most studies generally use some traditional &quot;discrimination coefficient&quot; and other methods to measure female employment discrimination. However, Goldin cleverly directly measured female employment discrimination by comparing the recruitment methods of American symphony orchestras before and after the reform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the reform of recruitment methods, symphony orchestras mainly selected musicians through direct interviews among the many outstanding candidates selected by the music director. This method favored male applicants and favored female applicants. discrimination against persons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the 1970s to the 1980s, the recruitment method was reformed in the form of &quot;blind performance&quot;, that is, listening to the performance level through a curtain screen. In this way, the judges will not know the gender of the musician applicant and can only recruit based on the applicant&#39;s technical level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the implementation of this reform, Golding found that the &quot;blind performance&quot; format can increase the likelihood of women advancing from the preliminary round by 50%, and the likelihood of entering the final stage has also increased several times. , the possibility of becoming an orchestra musician also greatly increases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Employment discrimination problems may occasionally be encountered in real life, so some of Goldin&#39;s research may help solve these problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Main Economic Thoughts&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Goldin has made important contributions to the study of gender discrimination, the history of educational development and the evolution of wage structure gaps. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Female employment and gender discrimination are important research topics in the field of labor economics, which have attracted the attention of many economists. Goldin&#39;s research mainly focuses on occupational segmentation caused by gender differences, factors affecting female employment, and the measurement of gender discrimination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Systematic research on the theory of discrimination in the labor market began with G. Becker (1957). Later economists gave various explanations on the causes of discrimination and the influencing factors of discrimination. Such as the crowding hypothesis (Bergmann, 1971) and statistical discrimination (Phelps, 1972). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different from these theoretical explanations, Golding focuses on analyzing the influencing factors of gender discrimination in female employment from an empirical perspective. She believes that the gender discrimination faced by women in the job search process is the result of a combination of factors, and analyzes it from the perspectives of World War II, the availability of contraceptive pills, and legislation on maximum working hours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Scholars such as Golding believe that birth control pills reduce the likelihood of pregnancy and thus increase the age at which women get married for the first time. The widespread use of contraceptive pills among unmarried women has also reduced the cost of women&#39;s long-term career investment and increased the proportion of educated women. More female college graduates have entered the labor market, promoting women&#39;s employment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Workers can improve their labor productivity and thus their income by receiving education, but what is the relationship between years of education and income? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the article &quot;The Quiet Revolution that Transformed Women&#39;s Employment, Education and the Family&quot; (2006), Golding divided women&#39;s employment from the late 19th century to that time into four stages based on changes in women&#39;s educational attainment: In the first stage, from the late 19th century to the 1920s, women in the labor market were usually young, unmarried women. At this time, the income elasticity of labor supply was very high, while the substitution elasticity was very small. Most female workers were not well educated. . The second stage lasted from the 1930s to around 1950. In this stage, restrictions on married women&#39;s work were relaxed. The income elasticity of labor supply dropped significantly in absolute terms. Secondary school enrollment and graduation rates increased, and part-time work increased. The rise of the economy and the popularization of office facilities have greatly increased women&#39;s labor market participation rate. The third stage, from the 1950s to the 1970s, was the origin stage of the &quot;Quiet Revolution&quot;. In the two age groups of 45-54 and 35-44, the labor force participation rate of women increased significantly, from 25% in 1950 rose to 46% in 1970. The fourth stage is from the late 1970s to the time when the paper was published, that is, the &quot;quiet revolutionary stage.&quot; The Quiet Revolution is mainly manifested through three indicators: horizon, identity, and decision making. Horizon mainly refers to a woman’s ability to predict her future career more accurately; identity refers to a woman’s name after marriage. retaining their surname; decision-making allows her to be better prepared to enter the labor market. The conclusion is that changing trends in women&#39;s education have promoted women&#39;s employment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Economic inequality is closely related to the level of educational development. Goldin also gave a detailed explanation of the relationship between the two in his book &quot;The Race between Education and Technology&quot; (with L.F. Katz, 2008). She pointed out that the United States began to implement mass education at the beginning of the 20th century, making the 20th century known as the &quot;human capital century&quot; and the &quot;American century.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About education, technology and economic inequality, it can be summarized as follows: 1. A more educated labor force can produce higher labor productivity, which in turn produces rapid economic growth. However, it is important to note that economic growth does not depend solely on investment in education, but also on the type of government, the degree of protection of property rights, and many other prerequisites. 2. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development of education can also drive technological progress. In turn, the continuous progress of technology also requires more and better-educated labor force. Relative to the labor force with less education, the wages of labor force with more education are higher, and the insufficient supply of labor force with more education will inevitably lead to the labor force with more education and more education. The wage gap between the less educated workforce continues to grow. If the relative proportions of different levels of education remain unchanged, technological progress will inevitably bring about economic inequality; in other words, if the quantity and quality of education increase, technological progress will promote the decline of economic inequality. 3. Throughout the 20th century, the economic growth of the United States showed a continuous rise, but economic inequality showed discontinuity. In the first 70 years of the 20th century, economic growth brought about a decline in inequality, but in the last 20 years of the 20th century, economic inequality gradually increased. 4. Judging from the above statements, the main reason why inequality in the United States first declined and then increased in the 20th century was due to the out-of-synchrony between the speed of educational development and the demand for talents in the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, there is a close connection between female employment and gender discrimination, educational development history and economic inequality. The development of education is an important factor influencing the increase in female employment and changes in economic inequality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Goldin has a wide range of research interests. In addition to the above-mentioned fields, it also involves many issues such as slavery and immigrant migration. She is a female economist with extensive research fields and rich academic achievements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a professor and doctoral supervisor at the Department of Economics, School of Economics, Liaoning University)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net &lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div >;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 22:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“国家需要就是我的专业”丨钱伟长110周年诞辰]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258367]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/10/9CXRlLqfFveyoWxWucuEqpM9sLsWKAY9XzF2d1VJ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;731&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/9CXRlLqfFveyoWxWucuEqpM9sLs WKAY9XzF2d1VJ. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253614&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Qian Weichang (1913-2010), born in Wuxi, Jiangsu, majored in physics and mechanics , applied mathematician, academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and president of Shanghai University during his lifetime. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;October 9, 2023, is the 110th anniversary of Chinese scientist and educator Qian Weichang Birthday anniversary.

I only scored 5 points in physics.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, according to research, the facts may be doubtful. A document titled &quot;Admission Standards for Undergraduate Students Recruited by National Tsinghua University Over the Years&quot; shows that in 1931, Tsinghua University required an overall average score of 54 or above in the entrance examination, and the average score requirement for the three subjects of Chinese, English, and mathematics was at least 54 points. 49 points or more. According to the requirement of taking five compulsory exams and two elective exams at that time, according to this calculation, the total score of the seven subjects should reach 378 points. If only the five compulsory subjects are counted, it will be at least 270 points, both of which are higher than 225 points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Soon after enrolling, Qian Weichang successfully passed the &quot;High School Algebra Analytical Geometry&quot; screening test organized by Tsinghua University. In 1932, in April of his second year of enrollment, Qian Weichang was able to independently translate mathematician Fox&#39;s English paper on algebraic equations. &quot;According to our historical data research, he received very strict (academic) training at Suzhou Middle School, and their textbooks were almost all English textbooks.&quot; Wang Yuandi, secretary of the Party Committee of Shanghai University Library (Archives Museum), told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Weichang spent his later years at the Yanchang Campus of Shanghai University. People often see Qian Weichang walking on the quiet campus. He enjoys greeting students and watching them walking hurriedly through the campus. He was particularly fond of a wide red jacket and always wore it when talking to students or communicating with leaders. Li Yin used to be the chairman of the Shanghai University Graduate Student Union and is now an academic teacher at Shanghai University. She and Qian Weichang met three times. She remembered that Qian Weichang, who was over 90 years old, was always full of energy and smiled with the innocence of a baby. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Weichang maintained the curiosity of a scientist throughout his life. He once wrote an article sorting out &quot;The Origin of &quot;China&quot;&quot; and also discussed &quot;the structural characteristics and non-uniqueness of the Chinese Rubik&#39;s Cube&quot;; he was concerned about the problem of sandstorms in the north and once wrote to Premier Zhu Rongji in 2001: The problem of sandstorms in the north may be It is related to the number of goats raised in Inner Mongolia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He did not use political business cards during his lifetime. When introducing himself, he often used three titles: president of Shanghai University, editor-in-chief of &quot;Applied Mathematics and Mechanics&quot;, and director of the Shanghai Institute of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics. These are the three identities he cherishes and are also important achievements in the later life of Qian Weichang as an educator. Dai Shiqiang, a tenured professor of Shanghai University who has worked with him for many years at the Shanghai Institute of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics, recalled that the magazine &quot;Applied Mathematics and Mechanics&quot; edited by Qian Weichang had only two academicians including him at the beginning, but later the editorial board had a total of There have been 15 academicians, 16 presidents and vice-presidents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dai Shiqiang said that Qian Weichang had three major interests in his life: football, Go and speaking. When he entered Tsinghua University, due to his poor family, Qian Weichang was only 1.49 meters tall, which was 1 centimeter shorter than the starting point of the height measurement benchmark. Like the ambitious young people of that era, he armed his body with patriotism. Less than two years after entering school, he participated in the Tsinghua cross-country team and won the championship at the sports meeting. He was later selected to the Tsinghua football team and represented the Chinese football team in the Far East Games held in the Philippines in 1937. When he graduated, Qian Weichang&#39;s height reached 1.65 meters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Weichang likes to talk. Dai Shiqiang noticed that during speeches, Qian Weichang liked to tear off a corner of the newspaper on the table and chew it in his mouth. As president of Shanghai University (1994-2010), he gave speeches to students at the opening and graduation ceremonies every year, which was his unshakable practice in his later years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Weichang&#39;s last public appearance in the media was in 2007, in Phoenix TV&#39;s feature film &quot;The Light of Life&quot;. At that time, he occasionally couldn&#39;t recognize people. Qian Wei always loved playing Go. Later, when he had no one to play with, he started playing backgammon, holding black in one hand and white in the other. Dai Shiqiang remembered that the last time he went to see him, Qian Weichang had sunspots in both hands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last time he spoke in front of students was at the graduation ceremony of Shanghai University in 2005. Qian Weichang gave a motto: &quot;Be worried about the world&#39;s worries first, and be happy after the world&#39;s happiness.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;He said to the students in the audience: Children, can you keep it in mind? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/HczUuZyE2ottYvWPOH3AOiVT6hMg5eEJsltukdNj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;659&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/HczUuZyE2ottYvWPOH3AOiVT6hMg5eEJsltukdNj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253616&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Qian Weichang was in the study before his death. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Science is needed to save the country&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;In 1913, Qian Weichang was born in a rural intellectual family in Wuxi. His fourth uncle was Qian Mu, a master of Chinese studies. There is an anecdote that is still talked about today: During the Tsinghua University Entrance Examination, Chen Yinke asked a question in the history test paper, requiring him to write down the name, volume, author and annotator of the Twenty-Four Histories. This question was difficult to answer. Many people were interviewed, but Qian Weichang answered them all and finally got full marks for this subject. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With a solid foundation in literature and history, it was a natural progression to enroll in the Chinese Department of Tsinghua University. But in 1931, on the third day after Qian Weichang entered school, the &quot;September 18th&quot; incident broke out. Qian Weichang&#39;s famous saying is widely known, &quot;I have no major, the country&#39;s needs are my majors.&quot; He felt that &quot;science is needed to save the country.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to enroll in the Department of Physics, Qian Weichang spent a week with Wu Youxun, the dean of the Department of Physics. Classes were held at eight o&#39;clock every day, and Qian Weichang went to the office to wait at a quarter past six. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Youxun couldn&#39;t test him, so he agreed to let him try it out. At that time, the Department of Physics of Tsinghua University had requirements for probationary students. The three courses of general chemistry, general physics and advanced mathematics needed to reach the intermediate level (70 points) or above. If they did not meet the standards, they would be returned to the original department. During the first seven weeks of the trial, Qian Wei studied physics according to the memorization method of studying Chinese studies, and his test results were &quot;a complete mess&quot;. It was only after Professor Wu Youxun&#39;s guidance that things changed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He goes to the Science Museum at five o&#39;clock every morning to recite. Usually when he gets there, Hua Luogeng has already finished reciting. After finding the key to learning, Qian Weichang successfully stayed in the Department of Physics. After graduating from his undergraduate degree, he was admitted as a graduate student in the Department of Physics of Tsinghua University with first place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like many progressive students at that time, Qian Weichang actively participated in the national salvation movement. In 1935, Qian Weichang participated in the &quot;December 9th&quot; student demonstrations. At the end of that year, he and several male classmates formed a bicycle team to go south and rode all the way to Nanjing to promote anti-Japanese and national salvation to the masses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After arriving at the Southwest Associated University in Kunming in 1939, he, Lin Jiaqiao and Guo Yonghuai were admitted to study abroad at the Chinese and British Boxer Indemnity Fund. The majors that the three people took the examination were all &quot;mechanics&quot;, and their scores were the same. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taking a boat trip from Shanghai to study in Canada, they were surprised to find a Japanese visa in their passports. The person in charge explained the reason: The cruise will be suspended in Yokohama, Japan, and the Japanese endorsement can facilitate their shore excursions. &quot;While the Japanese aggressor army occupied most of the motherland, they could not accept visas from the enemy&#39;s government,&quot; Qian Weichang wrote. They disembarked with their luggage. Seven months later, we set off again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After studying abroad at the University of Toronto for about fifty days, Qian Weichang co-authored &quot;The Intrinsic Theory of Elastic Plate Shells&quot; with his tutor Xin Ji. His research on the theory of elastic plate and shell bending unity began as early as Kunming. When I arrived in Canada, I found that I could combine the macro and micro ideas of my mentor. During World War II, due to the lack of guidance from a unified plate and shell strength theory, aircraft crashes and high-speed aircraft test failures were common. &quot;Intrinsic Theory of Elastic Plate Shells&quot; is also one of the first papers in this field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This article is included in the 60th birthday collection of American scientist von Karman. The authors of the collection also include physicists such as Einstein. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;To study plates and shells, Qian Weichang creatively used Riemannian geometry and tensor analysis to study the unified theory of plates and shells. Einstein studied general relativity and also used Riemannian geometry as a tool. So Qian Wei After the director reported the relevant results, it is not surprising that Einstein wanted to discuss and ask for advice from him.&quot; Dai Shiqiang told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After receiving his Ph.D., Qian Weichang went to the von Kármán Jet Propulsion Institute at California Institute of Technology as a postdoc. He collaborated with von Karman on &quot;Torsion of Variable Torque Rate&quot;, which von Karman called the most classic elastic mechanics paper in his life. Both Synge and von Karman belonged to the &quot;Göttingen School&quot;, a mathematical school that emphasized application. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Xin Ji&#39;s most significant influence on Qian Weichang is not to drown in the sea of ​​applied mathematics, but to climb up after solving the problem. After you get a knife, you have to sharpen it again. It&#39;s fast and good, and it can chop melons and vegetables, but you can&#39;t always appreciate how good and sharp my knife is,&quot; Dai Shiqiang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Weichang attaches great importance to practicality. When encountering practical problems that interest him, he does not limit himself to the subject areas in which he specializes. Some people call Qian Weichang a &quot;universal scientist&quot;. In 1970, domestic tank development faced difficulties: the four lead-acid batteries used in the tanks could only be started 15 times, and sometimes they could no longer walk after traveling dozens of kilometers. Qian Weichang is not a battery expert, but according to his creed, &quot;the needs of the country are my expertise&quot;, he organized a research team to study tank batteries while translating foreign documents and monographs. The next year, a high-energy battery was actually made that was the same size and weight as an ordinary battery but had eight times more energy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even in his later years, Qian Weichang will study new majors for the &quot;national needs&quot;. In 1980, Qian Weichang led a delegation to Hong Kong to participate in the International Chinese Computer Academic Conference. At the meeting, the Chinese computer technology of overseas companies such as IBM was relatively mature. Some people said disdainfully: It is too difficult for you to do this. China only needs to buy the products. Qian Weichang, who was over 60 years old at the time, began to learn computers and designed a macro glyph code for Chinese characters, referred to as &quot;Qian Code&quot;. At the first national Chinese character input program evaluation meeting, the single-person input speed of &quot;Qian Code&quot; ranked first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1946, Qian Weichang returned to China on the pretext of visiting relatives. In order not to attract attention, he only brought simple luggage and books. After returning to China, he worked as a professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Tsinghua University. From 1946 to 1949, domestic prices soared, and professors lived in poverty. Qian Weichang&#39;s salary of 140,000 French currency was not enough to buy two thermos bottles. In order to supplement his family income, he went to Yenching University School of Engineering and Peking University School of Engineering to teach part-time, &quot;contracting&quot; applied mechanics and materials mechanics courses at the three schools, as well as some senior courses, teaching more than 15 hours a week. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following year, the Jet Propulsion Institute of California Institute of Technology invited him to return to the United States to work, promising generous remuneration that could solve his financial difficulties at the time. Qian Weichang filled out the application form at the U.S. Consulate. The question on the last line was: If China and the United States go to war, will you be loyal to the United States? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Weichang resolutely filled in &quot;No&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/njgTdhnyAXpHUGqupVzYzcckzxEFgcaGXRRkBxf5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;633&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/njgTdhnyAXpHUGqupVzYzcckzxEFgcaGXRRkBxf5.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253615&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1986, Qian Weichang lectured at the Shanghai Institute of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“I am trying to recapture the good years that have been lost for a long time”&lt;/strong>;&lt; /h4>; &lt;p>;Qian Weichang has the typical stubbornness of a scientist. &quot;He can&#39;t rub his eyes with sand and likes to make judgments and decisions,&quot; Dai Shiqiang observed. This caused him to suffer a lot in a special era. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1952, Qian Weichang was appointed provost of Tsinghua University and was responsible for Tsinghua’s teaching reform. His educational philosophy was contrary to the Soviet model promoted at the time. The Soviet education model promoted the cultivation of specialists, but Qian Weichang believed that university education should cultivate students&#39; self-learning ability, and majors should not be divided too finely. Only in this way will students have the ability to discover and solve problems after entering society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1957, &quot;People&#39;s Daily&quot; published the article &quot;Issue on the Training Objectives of Higher Industrial Schools&quot;. This article is a relatively complete presentation of Qian Weichang’s educational thoughts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the article, he wrote: &quot;Before the teaching reform, the teaching work in higher industrial schools was aimless generalist teaching. After learning from the Soviet Union&#39;s experience in teaching reform, we learned to carry out effective teaching around a clear goal. A complete set of systems and methods for planned teaching work. This is a great progress... The quality of teaching has been improved in some aspects, but students are overloaded with learning, have poor ability to work independently, and the majors are too detailed and too specialized. , resulting in difficulties in allocating employment. These are not in line with the requirements of our country and are worthy of our study and improvement.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this reason, Qian Weichang was deprived of the right to speak on the podium after 1957. Only the title of &quot;Professor&quot; was retained, and the level was reduced from first-level professor to third-level professor. Later, when Deng Xiaoping was in charge of education work, he proposed, &quot;Qian Weichang should not stay in the laboratory, let him take classes.&quot; Later he said, &quot;There are many classes that cannot be taught, so let Qian Weichang take them; there are many problems, why don&#39;t you I understand, he understands, let him drive!&quot; So from 1961 to 1965, Qian Weichang went to nine departments of Tsinghua University and wrote nine lecture notes, and others used his lecture notes to teach. In his later years, he accepted an exclusive interview with CCTV&#39;s &quot;Everyone&quot; column and said: &quot;I still stick to everything I have.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;His son Qian Yuankai was also unable to continue higher education due to identity issues. In front of CCTV cameras, he recalled his father&#39;s teachings: &quot;What you learn in school is only a small piece in a person&#39;s life... People can deprive you of the opportunity to go to school, but no one can deprive you of the opportunity to learn.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;The main job of scientists is to discover and solve problems. When people and scientific and technological workers came to consult or send letters, he tried his best to help: he translated machine instructions for the factory free of charge; he provided corresponding enhancement plans for the stability of the &quot;work&quot; beams at the edge of the balcony of the Great Hall of the People; At that time, he relied on a hand-cranked calculator to calculate the &quot;sum of Fourier triangle series&quot; in a large table and made some practical contributions. The final manuscript was 30 centimeters thick. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There is a passage he said that I admire very much: I think about some problems every day, thinking about these problems that have not been solved by others in the past. Later, someone solved them and I was very happy. Later, no one solved this problem. I just wonder why. I am very happy when I can figure out a problem, and I am happier than being an official.&quot; Dai Shiqiang told a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the end of the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, Qian Weichang began to give lectures on the four modernizations across the country. &quot;Mr. Qian is so smart. He understands the spirit of the above very well. How to build our country (four modernizations) is clear and logical. Everyone likes to listen... He kept talking about Ili, Xinjiang, and the ethnic minorities in Ili came here on horses and camels. Listen to his lectures.&quot; Dai Shiqiang recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the preface of &quot;Selected Scientific Papers of Qian Weichang&quot;, Qian Weichang revealed his mood at that time: &quot;I regained the right to do scientific work. I was delighted to see the National Science Conference convened by the Party Central Committee in 1978, and the spring breeze was blowing. , a feeling of excitement arises spontaneously. Although I am nearly seventy years old, I can still serve the &quot;four modernizations&quot; and feel infinite happiness. I strive to recapture the good years that have passed away and work day and night.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong>;Advanced education reform&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 1983, Qian Weichang left Tsinghua University and went to Shanghai University of Technology (later merged to become the current Shanghai University) as president. The transfer order signed by Deng Xiaoping read: &quot;There is no age limit for this person&#39;s appointment.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Weichang&#39;s identity as president of Shanghai University continued until the last moment of his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a saying that Qian Weichang was appointed as the president of Shanghai University of Technology when he came to Shanghai. I was a little disappointed after reading &quot;Quality School&quot;. Dai Shiqiang told Southern Weekend reporters that this was not the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said that in 1979, as Qian Wei grew older, he began to think about leaving Tsinghua University. Huazhong Institute of Technology (now Huazhong University of Science and Technology), Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Shanghai University of Technology are all interested in asking him to be their president. Zhu Jiusi, the dean of Huazhong Institute of Technology at that time, was a close friend of Qian Weichang. In 1980, when Qian Weichang founded the first domestic magazine &quot;Applied Mathematics and Mechanics&quot;, Zhu Jiusi contributed money and efforts to help publish the English version. When he learned that Qian Weichang was leaving Tsinghua University, he was willing to give in to others. However, Qian Weichang refused based on various considerations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Between Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Shanghai University of Technology, someone advised him: &quot;Jiaotong University is a famous school, and the famous school does not want your famous professors to increase its glory, but Shanghai University of Technology is not a famous school, and they are looking for talents. If you are thirsty, you can do it right away with real swords and guns.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he first arrived at Shanghai University of Technology, Qian Weichang quickly started reforms. He offered to “tear down the four walls.” The first is to tear down the wall between school and society. In order to adapt to the changes and needs of society, some majors are streamlined and compressed, and majors such as applied mathematics and mechanics, fine chemical engineering, etc. are added. The second is to tear down the walls between various departments and majors in the school. Wall, the first two years of college are not divided into majors, regardless of arts and sciences, it is recommended to study computers; the third is to tear down the wall between education and scientific research. The last item is to tear down the walls of the old concept of &quot;teaching and learning&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Weichang opposed teachers who read from the script. He once said: &quot;For any teacher who reads from the script, students can be absent from class or not attend his class, because the students themselves can read faster than he can.&quot; Zhong&#39;s requirements for teachers were initially influenced by his teacher Ye Qisun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On New Year&#39;s Day in 1939, when Qian Weichang arrived at Southwest Associated University after many twists and turns, his teacher Ye Qisun was transferred to the Chongqing Research Institute. Qian Weichang was responsible for teaching a one-semester thermodynamics course to Ye Qisundai. After getting Ye&#39;s lecture notes, Qian Weichang discovered that although the basic principles to be taught remained the same, the example questions had been replaced with the latest questions raised in international science and technology magazines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Although the same course is taught every year, the application scope of its basic theory should be changed every year, so that a basic course must keep up with the pace of scientific development. A large number of relevant international science and technology journals must be read every year. Only by digesting and absorbing the teaching materials can the professor fulfill his teaching responsibility.&quot; Qian Weichang was inspired by this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Weichang also proposed three system reforms for the school: credit system, course selection system, and short-term system. The credit system and course selection system give students autonomy to the greatest extent. The course selection system allows students to &quot;jump&quot; classes and choose courses across grades. &quot;Students who study particularly well can learn more.&quot; This kind of educational reform was far ahead of other universities at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Yuandi was a college student in the 1980s. He recalled that many schools followed the Soviet system at that time. &quot;The College of Engineering is the College of Engineering, and the College of Agriculture is the College of Agriculture. The distinction between majors is relatively strict. For example, if you study steel, you will immediately enter the blast furnace plant as a technician after leaving. For example, if you are a student of the Mining Department, you must be comprehensive. Knowing how to find ore, how to mine, and being able to use it right away is such a very specialized education.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Weichang does not believe that there should be clear distinctions between disciplines, especially between liberal arts and science. . In 1998, he made it very clear in an article published in Guangming Daily: &quot;I believe that the traditional disciplinary boundaries between natural sciences, technical sciences, social sciences and humanities will soon be eliminated, and they will be combined into a complete scientific knowledge. system. Different disciplines are no longer separated by lines like mountains, but by learning from each other&#39;s strengths.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Qian Weichang&#39;s scientific research also benefited from his foundation in Chinese studies to a certain extent. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dai Shiqiang gave an example. Qian Weichang studied the intrinsic theory of plate and shell using the same ideas as studying Chinese studies. &quot;People who study Chinese studies are very good at analyzing and classifying.&quot; Qian Weichang divided the plates and shells into 12 plates and 35 types of shells based on their characteristics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On today’s Shanghai University campus, traces of the lifelong president’s reforms can be found in many places. When designing the campus, Qian Weichang specifically proposed that the women&#39;s toilets should be larger than those for boys. Shanghai University has a corridor that is common in southern schools, making it easier for students taking courses to move around in different classrooms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yin is now responsible for the academic work of international students. During the first lesson of the semester, she often takes the students to familiarize themselves with the campus environment. She told Southern Weekend reporters that when arriving at Weichang Building, she would always tell the students about the origin of the building: &quot;At that time, he felt that every university must have a very grand (place) where The student takes it from his parents, and when he graduates, he will be ceremoniously sent to society.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Weichang attaches great importance to cultivating students&#39; problem awareness and innovative spirit. &quot;Society needs people who can come out of college with a head full of questions and be creative rather than imitative.&quot; He believes that college teachers should make it clear to students that they should not think that they have learned a lot after graduation. I understand everything, but actually I still understand very little. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“From a person without problems to a person with problems, this is the success of university education.” Qian Weichang said that if students feel that they should solve these problems, they will continue to create and innovation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;(Note: Main reference: Volumes 4, 5 and 6 of &quot;Selected Works of Qian Weichang&quot;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 22:25:07 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[心理咨询中的性争议：“咨询师没有任何理由和来访者发生性关系”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258353]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/10/iyq1ToLamR5wWT8RlEbvi1gVIZVrifMYdJP2MdA1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/iyq1ToLamR5wWT8RlEbvi1gVIZVrifMYdJ P2MdA1. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253592&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The relevant ethics code of the Chinese Psychological Society clearly stipulates that psychologists are not allowed to seek professional services with current any form of sexual or intimate relationship with a person or a member of their family. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 16, 2023, netizen &quot;Dong Ni&quot; posted that she was between 2014 and 2018 , received psychological counseling services from counselor Li Songwei, and was repeatedly sexually assaulted, mentally abused and psychologically controlled during four years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 25, psychological counselor Li Songwei made a public response, saying that the accusations posted online were pure slander, denying that he had committed the above-mentioned behavior, and expressing his willingness to accept the supervision of psychological counseling ethics and accept relevant investigations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2007, the Chinese Psychological Society formulated and announced the &quot;Code of Ethics for Clinical and Counseling Psychology (First Edition)&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Code of Ethics&quot;), which is regarded as a reliable guide for the psychological counseling industry. Statute; in 2018, the first edition was revised by the Chinese Psychological Society. Both versions of the code have strict regulations on sexual or intimate relationships in the counseling relationship: psychologists shall not have any form of sexual or intimate relationships with those currently seeking professional services or their family members; psychologists shall not engage in sexual or intimate relationships. Professional services are provided to clients in an intimate relationship; within three years after the counseling relationship ends, any form of sexual or intimate relationship with the person seeking professional services or their family members is not allowed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not the first time that a client and counselor has been involved in controversy over inappropriate intimacy and sexual relations in the Chinese psychology community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2014, psychological counselor Wang Xingbo was complained to the &quot;Ethics Subcommittee of the Professional Institutions and Professional Registration System of Clinical and Counseling Psychology of the Chinese Psychological Society&quot; for having inappropriate sexual relations with clients. Wang Xingbo was then The registration supervisor for this registration system. After nearly half a year of internal and external investigations and cross-examination by parties, the ethics subcommittee finally confirmed that Wang Xingbo clearly violated the Chinese Psychological Association&#39;s &quot;Ethical Code&quot; and was removed from the registration system. This is the first ethics violation case in the country to be publicized by the registration system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, Hunan psychological counselor Luo Dengguo was convicted of forced indecency by the Changsha Intermediate People’s Court in the second instance. The final judgment document of the case shows that since May 2017, the victim Chu sought psychological counseling services from Luo Deng State Office 5 times due to depression and bipolar disorder. During the consultation process, Luo Dengguo took the initiative to talk to the visitors about sex-related topics, and used methods that Chu mistook for psychological treatment, and repeatedly committed indecent acts against the victim. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Kaiwen, PhD in clinical psychology from Peking University and founder of DaRu Psychology, is a member of the Psychological Work Consultant Committee and leader of the Ethics Working Group of the Chinese Psychological Society. In 2014, he served as the secretary-general and ethics committee member of the committee. Members of the ethics working group on the Wang Xingbo incident participated in the investigation. He also participated as a team member in the revision of the second edition of the Code of Ethics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the experience of handling many ethical incidents, Xu Kaiwen summarized five possible situations of sexual and intimate disputes in psychological work, and proposed the handling directions respectively: 1. The counselor did commit sexual assault, which is a criminal offense If there is a problem, judicial channels should be taken; 2. There is an inappropriate sexual relationship during the consultation, which is an ethical issue and needs to be dealt with by professional associations such as the Chinese Psychological Society; 3. Sexual transference occurs during the consultation, that is, an emotional reaction occurs between the client and the consultant. , it is a clinical issue and the counselor can discuss it with the supervisor; 4. The client has delusions of love and may have mental illness and needs psychiatric help; 5. False accusation is a legal issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the Li Songwei incident, Xu Kaiwen told Southern Weekend reporters that he would not comment on the incident until the facts are clear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of September 2023, Xu Kaiwen accepted an exclusive interview with Southern Weekend regarding possible ethical misconduct and sexual abuse during consultation. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;We have no way to completely determine whether he is completely voluntary&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font- family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The Wang Xingbo incident in 2014 was the first ethical complaint case regarding inappropriate sexual relations between a counselor and a client that was publicized by the &quot;registration system&quot; in China. As a member of the ethics working group at the time, you were specifically What work was done? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The visitor made a complaint. Based on a large amount of relevant evidence provided by the visitor, we confirmed the facts after nearly a year of investigation and evidence collection. Afterwards, our ethics working group put forward disciplinary opinions in accordance with the &quot;Code of Ethics&quot; after multiple rounds of discussions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When proving that a visitor has been sexually assaulted or harassed , which can be used as evidence? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think this is very difficult, because it is not easy to prove that two people have had sexual relations when they were alone. . However, if the visitor can provide information such as ambiguous text messages, WeChat, and contacts other than the consultation relationship, this can indirectly prove that they have indeed had sexual relations. In this case, it should still be possible to indirectly prove that inappropriate sexual relations did occur. relation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From 2019 to 2021, you served as a The visitor’s expert witness, what was the situation at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It means that the counselor and the client had inappropriate sexual and intimate relationships, and the client felt hurt, so the client filed a lawsuit A consultant. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Experts assist witnesses in similar sexual controversies What role does it play? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Tell the judge why it is not against his professional ethics for a dentist to fall in love with his patient, but it is not against his professional ethics for a psychological counselor to fall in love with him It is a violation of professional ethics for clients to have sexual and intimate relationships. Because psychological counseling is based on trust, the client candidly show us everything in his heart. First of all, it is not because he trusts us as a person, but because he trusts our profession. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, I had an appendicitis operation under general anesthesia. General anesthesia meant that I completely lost control of my body for about three or four hours. Just kidding. It is said to be &quot;at the mercy of others&quot;. But why was I lying on the operating table &quot;at the mercy of others&quot;? I want to fix my appendicitis. First of all, because I trust my doctor, he will not do anything to harm me because I am unconscious, but will help me instead. But I may not know this doctor at all, so why would I trust someone I don’t know? It&#39;s because I trust the profession, not the person. And there is legal protection here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The process of psychological counseling is similar to the process of surgery in that only when the client completely trusts us and can confess all the pain, sadness, shame, and hurt he has experienced in front of me, can we It might be possible to help him better. So if we want to win this trust, we must not betray this trust. When a visitor comes to seek help, he must be fragile, he is easily hurt, he is in pain and needs help, so he is in a psychological state. fragile state. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The trust of our clients in us is the premise and foundation for effective psychological counseling, so this trust must not be destroyed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of trust cannot be used to obtain improper benefits. For example, if I do a consultation and I charge him 100 yuan, but the visitor finds it helpful and wants to give me an extra 100 yuan, this is also not allowed. Or he wants to give me an expensive gift to express his gratitude, which is also not allowed. There are additional benefits involved. Because I have mastered your inner secrets, it is theoretically possible for me to use my mastery of your inner secrets to blackmail you into agreeing to some of my inappropriate demands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just like why teachers in colleges and universities cannot have sex and intimate relationships with students, because he will decide whether you can get credits, whether you can graduate, and whether you can get a degree. This kind of power is not right. Equality may be abused, resulting in improper benefits. In order to avoid this situation, the professional ethics of our industry require that any such improper and additional benefits cannot be obtained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If there is a violation of the &quot;Ethical Code&quot;, even if the client is voluntary, it will be considered a violation of psychological counseling ethics. Because we have no way to completely determine whether he is completely voluntary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You supervised a public welfare psychological counseling project last year.

To put it simply, it is the client&#39;s belief that the counselor has sexual implications for her. The school conducted a very serious investigation. Of course, whoever accuses has to provide evidence. How do you think the other party sexually harassed you? You need to provide relevant evidence. For example, the teacher sent very ambiguous and sexually charged text messages and WeChat messages to students. These are considered violations of teacher ethics. At least there must be such indirect materials. The student who made the complaint did not provide such evidence, she only talked about her subjective feelings, and no substantive behavior occurred, so of course the accusation is not valid. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/H9QNNJcZX730QWNkD7Mee1KvCKTYL5BiYzSzB16a.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/H9QNNJcZX730QWNkD7Mee1KvCKTYL5BiYzSzB16a.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253593&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the 2008 American TV series &quot;Inquiry into the Heart&quot;, a case of a female client showing empathy towards a psychological counselor was shown. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Removal from the registration system is the heaviest penalty&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Chinese Psychological Society&#39;s Code of Ethics for Clinical and Counseling Psychology (Second Edition)&quot; involves sexuality There are two rules for relationships. What are the considerations behind these two rules? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The formulation of this rule is actually the consensus of the psychological counseling industry. Regulations like this have long existed abroad. In this sense, they are the result of learning from foreign psychology circles. Such an inappropriate sexual relationship will cause serious physical and mental harm to the visitor, so it is an expressly prohibited behavior. The most important principle in psychological counseling ethics is the principle of benevolence. Maximizing the interests of clients is the first priority and is the purpose of our work. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In recent years, the &quot;Code of Ethics&quot; and Have the rules around sex changed? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Basically not. If anything, behaviors including sex and intimacy electronically are also prohibited and unethical. Cybersex, which does not involve actual physical contact, is also included. In the counseling relationship, any form of sexual and intimate relationship with the client is considered to be exploitative, harmful and exploitative of the client. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How to define cybersex? In the absence of physical contact, are confessions, flirtations, ambiguities, etc. on the Internet counted? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There are currently no practical cases in this regard. As far as I know, there are currently no relevant legal regulations on cybersex and virtual sex in our country. However, after three years of the epidemic, remote consultations such as Internet phone calls have become more and more developed, so the possibility of such problems becoming more and more likely to occur. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From a psychological point of view, if consultation If a teacher performs inappropriate sexual behavior on a client, what kind of psychological harm will it cause to the client? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kevin Xu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think the main trauma that may be caused to him is at the level of trust. Because the client believes that we will put his interests first, trust that we will keep his secrets, and we will not use the client&#39;s trust in the counselor to do things that harm him, but all this happens, then he may It will be difficult to build trust with everyone. Because he may have been harmed by others, if this harm occurs again in the counseling relationship, the harm may appear more serious. None of the counselors who should be trusted can be trusted, perhaps all of them, or most of them. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Compared to general sexual harassment or assault , when it occurs between counselor and client, will it cause additional harm? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kevin Xu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;No matter what profession, sexual assault or sexual harassment is against the law. If the visitor is non-consensual, it is sexual assault and sexual harassment, which is a legal issue. But if the visitors are voluntary, it may not be a problem in other industries, but for our industry, it is an ethical issue. Because you may have taken advantage of the client&#39;s trust in the psychological counseling profession. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When a female visitor, during the psychological consultation process I feel uncomfortable in this regard. Is there any channel through which I can complain in the psychological counseling industry? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;You can complain to the Ethics Working Group of the Clinical Psychology Registration Committee of the Chinese Psychological Society, but the complaint channels may not be very suitable. Because this is the ethics complaint mechanism of an academic organization, it is not a national government agency. If the consultant complained against is not a member of the Clinical Psychology Registration Working Committee of the Chinese Psychological Society, it will be difficult to handle the subsequent complaints. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In other words, in China, if a person Want to become a psychological counselor, but there are no barriers to entry? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes. Currently, there are no strict barriers to entry. It turned out that there was a psychological counselor examination from the Ministry of Social Security, but this examination was stopped in 2017. Now, except for those who had obtained the qualification of psychological counselors from the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security at that time (psychological counselors), as well as psychiatrists and psychotherapists, other practitioners do not have clear certificates. Our country&#39;s licensing system in this regard has not yet been established. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Can it be understood that in the &quot;Registration System&quot; Can these consultants registered here be regarded as regular practitioners? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think it is possible, but it cannot be said that only those who work in the &quot;registration system&quot; are formal. There are also a large number of well-trained counselors, including those who have obtained master&#39;s or even doctorate degrees, including those who have returned from studying abroad, as well as counselors with rich clinical experience and good professional ethics, who have not participated in the registration because this is not a mandatory national standard. . So this cannot be the only criterion, but it is a reliable criterion. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Code of Ethics&quot; seems to be just an industry restraint, what role can the Chinese Psychological Association play when encountering specific sexual controversies? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Just like the situation of Wang Moumou (Note: Wang Xingbo) you just mentioned, this should be the most typical Chinese world No. 1 An ethical complaint about inappropriate sexual relations.

In fact, the solution should be to establish a license system, just like a doctor has a license. If his license is revoked, he cannot practice medicine. Otherwise, he will practice medicine illegally and may even be held criminally responsible. But we haven&#39;t established a license system yet, so it&#39;s more difficult at this point. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Industries with relatively high requirements for moral self-discipline&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font -family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Some literature believes that sexual ethical aberrations appear as &quot;erotic transference&quot; and &quot;eroticized transference&quot; on the client&#39;s side. This Is it what you call &quot;sexual transference&quot;? Why does sexual transference occur in a counseling relationship? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There are various reasons, which may be difficult to summarize in one sentence. For example, if the client has experienced sexual assault, she may develop a mentality that all her value lies in her body, so she will use her body to gain recognition from people with power and authority. It&#39;s a possibility, it&#39;s very individual. So it is difficult to say which one is absolute, it depends on the specific situation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the psychological counseling relationship is also a kind of interpersonal relationship, a professional and professional interpersonal relationship. In the process of psychological consultation and psychotherapy, the counselor will focus on the client, deeply empathize, understand, feel and respond to the client. This is a kind of complete care and unconditional support, which is both professional and There is a certain unreality, because such an almost one-way, client-centered interpersonal relationship is an idealized existence in real life. Because even the closest interpersonal relationships between family members and friends are two-way. While giving and giving, you will also receive the same similar support and rewards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I once interviewed a client who fell in love with her counselor and came to complain. During the consultation, she felt that the counselor was the most understanding and supportive person in the world, and he was also the most considerate. and warm person, so I fell in love with the counselor. But once she enters a relationship or even a marriage, the client soon feels more and more disappointed because she discovers that the person who is completely centered on her will also have emotional demands for herself and cannot fully express herself once she becomes a lover or a couple. Self-centered. This disappointment then led to the breakdown of the marriage, and even led to doubts about the other party&#39;s motives for falling in love with him at that time, and eventually he filed a lawsuit in court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This change in feelings from heaven to hell is the inevitable result of crossing the boundaries of the professional counseling relationship and having sex and intimacy. But this does not mean that it is untrue or unscientific for the counseling relationship to provide clients with such a safe, trusting, warm, and supportive relationship. Clients have encountered difficulties and setbacks in their real lives, resulting in psychological pain and distress. , so when people come to seek help, counselors provide them with a psychological healing environment, just like when a person is sick, he needs to live in a very clean hospital ward. Professional doctors and nurses provide professional and scientific medical equipment, environment, nutrition and medicine to help them improve their immunity and restore health. Even when their immunity is low, they have to be admitted to sterile rooms and negative pressure wards. Under the careful care of doctors and nurses, patients can enhance their resistance and restore their immunity. Once you are healthy, you can be discharged from the hospital and live a normal life - in psychological consultation, the client will have the ability to solve his own interpersonal and intimate relationship problems, and the consultation can end at this time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not wrong for the client to feel that he has fallen in love with the counselor, but it may be an illusion. Counselors need to clearly understand this and work professionally as an important clinical issue in counseling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Does the client need to avoid this kind of sexual transference? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think there is some inevitability in the occurrence of sexual transference. It&#39;s not a scary thing, it&#39;s a normal psychological phenomenon. Therefore, if such a situation occurs, it should be discussed and resolved during consultation, which itself is an important issue in consultation. This is a professional question. If a counselor encounters such a problem and has no experience, he can discuss with his supervisor or his superior counselor how to better help the client deal with all this. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;If the counselor has counter-transference to the client Love, what should I do in this situation? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This may also happen to counselors. Counselors are also human beings, and they also have emotions and desires, and they also have personal issues that they have not solved well. . He may indeed mistake the client&#39;s sexual transference for love, or even fall in love with the client. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the training and professional ethics of counselors require that we cannot have such sexual and intimate relationships with clients under any circumstances. This is like a law that everyone in this industry implements to the letter. The reason why this article is implemented is because there have been many such situations in the foreign psychology industry before, which have caused great harm to visitors and the reputation of the industry, so it is expressly prohibited. If he can handle such clinical issues well, of course it would be best; if he can&#39;t handle it well, he should find a supervisor; if he still can&#39;t handle it after finding a supervisor, he should stop consulting and then refer the consulting work to a more suitable consultant. Not just keep doing it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In this case, the moral self-discipline of counselors is very high? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes.

If the consultant himself is the head of the agency, or if this is a private organization, such as the consultant&#39;s personal studio, it is recommended to consider terminating the consulting relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The psychological counseling industry should establish a licensing system&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You mentioned that the controversy over sex and intimacy during psychological counseling also involves delusions of love and false accusations. Can you introduce these two situations? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kevin Xu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>; Delusion of love is a serious mental illness. For example, celebrities often fall in love with crazy fans, and the fans think that the celebrity loves him. , in fact, the celebrity has never met him and clearly denies any love for him. This is an example of delusion of love. Delusions are inconsistent with reality and cannot be corrected by reality. Delusions are based on biological genetic factors and do not need to have any realistic basis or psychosocial reasons. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What are the common motives for false accusations? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The false accusation may be due to dissatisfaction with the consultant. In order to ruin the reputation of the consultant, it is not based on the facts or fabricates some Facts then accuse the counselor. So I say, &quot;Facts are wisdom.&quot; Let’s get the facts straight first. Have you ever had sex or intimate relationships? If so, then the counselor has at least violated ethics and even the law. If this behavior had never happened, then there would be no question of illegality and ethical violation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What price will the false accuser have to pay? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;False accusations mainly involve issues of reputational rights.

It is indeed very difficult to determine this, and this is obviously not a job that psychologists are good at.

Many clients may not know that sexual relations between counselors and clients violate the ethics of counselors, and this is worth publicizing to the public. Of course, if the visitor knows that he can refuse and knows how to protect himself in a similar situation, this is obviously an effective way.

We also hope that the media can help our industry call on the country to strengthen legislation in this area. There are legal provisions related to the &quot;Mental Health Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot;, but they are still not enough for the management of this industry.

It is not systematic and comprehensive enough and cannot adapt to modern times. Today&#39;s psychological counseling industry in China is different, and the demand for mental health has greatly increased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The simplest and most direct solution is to establish a licensing system. Only after obtaining a license can you work as a psychological counselor, and then accept the supervision of the state and industry associations. If there is any behavior that violates ethics, professional ethics and the law, his license will be revoked. If he engages in such work without a license, he is practicing medicine illegally and can be held criminally responsible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[为什么要讲“科技伦理”？这是攸关文明与人类存续的大事丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258345]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On October 8, 2023, the official website of the Ministry of Science and Technology announced the &quot;Technology Ethics Review Measures (Trial)&quot;, which stipulates: Units engaged in scientific and technological activities such as life sciences, medicine, and artificial intelligence, if the research content involves sensitive areas of scientific and technological ethics, should establish a scientific and technological ethics (review) committee (Article 4). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This concerning regulation not only reflects that scientific research activities in these fields are highly active and are making visible progress, but also reflects that some scientific research breakthroughs are not only cognitive boundaries, but also ethical boundaries. There is indeed a necessity and urgency to clarify ethical boundaries and build social consensus, because this is not just a matter for individual scientists or the so-called &quot;internal&quot; matter, but a &quot;matter for everyone&quot; involving everyone&#39;s rights. During this period, some misunderstandings about scientific research ethics also need to be analyzed and clarified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, &quot;Scientific research activities are benevolent or at least neutral, so there are no restricted areas for scientific research.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Scientific research is different from scientific research and cannot be generalized. Mathematicians use paper and pencil to perform calculations, while physicists use astronomical telescopes to look into the universe, and use particle accelerators to try to blast apart atomic nuclei to peer into microscopic mysteries. There is no problem in saying that these scientific research are benevolent. It not only expands the boundaries of human cognition and sets a benchmark for truth-seeking, but also has no impact on the values ​​​​that support the survival of human society, but rather adds to it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The human trials of drugs, human brain interfaces, artificial wombs, and the manipulation of human embryos and DNA are obviously very different. This kind of scientific research not only directly uses people as research subjects or people themselves as participants, but also the research process and possible results have real and potential major impacts on human society itself, including but not limited to lifestyles and values, and must be treated with caution. Again, proceed cautiously and with social consensus, which is the responsible attitude towards society and civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be more serious, if anti-human elements are allowed to conduct such research and use such discoveries for anti-human purposes, it is not impossible that human society will be destroyed as a result. For example, the cost and acquisition threshold for genetic modification and editing technologies are getting lower and lower, and this technology is not neutral to the survival of human society. Appalling things have happened in the past: using human bodies as test subjects to develop bacterial weapons is a crime against the entire human race. Therefore, in the 1970s, the international community formed the Biological Weapons Convention, which prohibited the development, production and stockpiling of such weapons. Nowadays, genetic technology is advancing by leaps and bounds. If such technologies are not regulated, the entire human race will face unprecedented threats. This threat is much higher than the probability of nuclear annihilation. The most terrible thing is not to have risks, but to ignore the risks and fall into arrogance and arrogance. The importance of science and technology ethics can be seen here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thus, the saying that “scientific research has no restricted areas” is difficult to establish. Scientific research includes research purposes/effects and research methods. In terms of purpose/effect, there are many possibilities such as good/beneficial, neutral, bad/unfavorable, and good/evil/mixed of pros and cons; in terms of means, there are also different situations such as legal, ethical, illegal, and ethical violation. For a specific scientific research field or a specific scientific research activity, should a restricted area be established? What kind of restricted area should be established? Should the restricted area be established from the beginning of the research and development process or should it be established in the dissemination process? The specific scientific research purpose must be systematically measured/ Effects and means cannot be generalized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2. &quot;Scientific research is a matter for scientists, and the public has no say.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the analysis of the first point, it is not difficult to infer that this point is also untenable. Scientific research activities are high-level cognitive activities that scientists engage in. It is true that they cannot be carried out without a certain amount of talent and professional training. &quot;Debating whether coal should be washed with water or anthracite for rocket launches,&quot; even if professionals reply seriously, they will lose. But beyond that, there are many things that the public or taxpayers have the right to ask about. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, if scientific research activities are originally funded by taxpayers’ money, taxpayers certainly have the right to interfere with the rationality of the use of the money, including but not limited to: the expansion of the boundaries of knowledge and the impact of this project on society. What are the benefits and possible impacts on values, whether the cost budget is reasonable, whether the scientific research methods are ethical, and whether the results have achieved the expected goals. If it is private funding, the private sponsor also has the right to ask similar questions. Whoever contributes money has the right to intervene. This reflects the basic ethics of human society: &quot;Being entrusted by others and being loyal to others&quot; is the ethical prerequisite for engaging in any activities, including scientific research activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, as mentioned in the first point, if the research field or research activity uses human research objects, or/and has an impact on human life style, values, civilization and even the existence of Homo sapiens as a species, Impact or threat, that is, it is related to everyone&#39;s vital rights and interests. Every member of society has the right to intervene. Research is not funded by taxpayers or &quot;individual freedom&quot; or &quot;scientific research is noble and sacred and an elite activity&quot; are not evading the public. Reason for intervening. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To sum up, the two major reasons why the public has the right to intervene are the roots of the need for scientific and technological ethics. In this sense, science and technology ethics are not mysterious. They are just the embodiment of universal ethics and values ​​that everyone in human society must follow in the field of scientific research: If any activity you engage in is funded by someone, then you must accept it. Accountability of funders; if the activities you engage in have actual or potential &quot;negative externalities&quot; on third parties or society, you must effectively control them and not do whatever you want. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Scientists have a halo, but having a halo does not mean that they can ignore ethics, or be dismissive of the public’s right to intervene, thinking that &quot;scientists can just rely on self-discipline.&quot; Scientists are also members of society. They must abide by the ethics that everyone abides by in daily life and follow the guidance of scientific and technological ethics in scientific research activities. Only in this way can scientific research be good and not lose its way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
