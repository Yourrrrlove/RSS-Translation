(hereinafter referred to as Jikun Coal Mine&lt;/span>;) +290m east of Shimen South Wing, a large gas explosion accident occurred on the second floor of the fourth uphill coal mining face, causing 4 deaths and 4 injuries (another 4 people Physical discomfort, recovered after receiving oxygen), direct economic loss of 10.16 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the accident, Jikun Coal Mine failed to report the accident as required, illegally transshipping and cremating the remains of the victims, and sealing off the accident site to conceal the accident. After receiving reports from the masses, when the Baishan City Emergency Management Bureau and the Jiangyuan District Emergency Management Bureau went to the coal mine to verify the reported cases from April 3 to 12, 2023, the mine still failed to report truthfully. On April 13th and 14th, four people including the mine investor and mine manager surrendered under pressure. The accident was verified to be true by the Baishan Municipal People&#39;s Government. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, the Jilin Bureau of the National Mine Safety Supervision Bureau released the accident investigation report. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;How the accident occurred&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;During the day shift on April 2, 2023, mine manager Li Yonghai organized a pre-shift work meeting. Li Yanping, deputy director of production, Lu Wanping, chief engineer, and Li Shichen, technical consultant, assigned production tasks to each team. After the meeting, Yang Licheng, captain of the third mining team, assigned production tasks for the shift to Wang Hongchang, the squad leader of the accident squad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Hongchang’s team has 13 people on duty and 1 tile inspector. Wang Hongchang arranged for Leng Jun, Ji Yaomin, Zhang Chengxue and Zhang Qinglong to set off cannons and produce coal at Sanshang Mountain. He, Wang Junfu and Sun Cheng set off cannons and produce coal at Sishang Mountain, Li Junsheng and Guo Wensheng built wood stacks for reinforcement at Wushang Mountain, and Yang Lianpeng and Gao Cai installed equipment in the main alley. Cars, Huang Fujun and Zhang Yongsheng are responsible for pulling coal. Lu Xiang is responsible for checking the gas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The workers entered the well from the abandoned heating tunnel at about 8:00, and picked up their own miner&#39;s lamps from the &quot;Miner&#39;s Lamp Supermarket&quot; there. They did not carry personnel identification cards and self-rescuers, and arrived at their respective operations at about 8:15. Place. At around 10 o&#39;clock, in order to solve the ventilation problem at the Wushangshan working face, the ventilation team leader Guan Yanlin led three workers to move the local ventilator between Sishangshan and Wushangshan at +290m East Shimen back 20 meters and move it away from the wind The bifurcation of the cylinder connects the air duct to Wushangshan. This local ventilator supplies air to the three working surfaces of Sanshangshan, Sishangshan and Wushangshan at the same time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At around 13:30, Ji Yaomin and others who were working on Sanshang Mountain suddenly saw a puff of black smoke and the wind stopped. They felt difficulty breathing and could not see anything. Zhang Qinglong and Zhang Chengxue took the lead to escape. Ji Yaomin and Leng Jun took the tools and then ran outside. When they ran to Sanshang Pass, they found that there was wind in the alleyway. At this time, Zhang Qinglong and Zhang Chengxue were lying on the ground and lost consciousness. They immediately performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation and rescued them. About 5 minutes later, The two woke up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this time, Liu Tiezhu, the project manager who was walking to the entrance of the central water pump room at +290m, felt a large fluctuation in the wind flow, and saw a lot of dust in the wind flow in the direction of Dongyi Shimen, so he went After checking, they saw the injured Lu Xiang, Gao Cai and Guo Wensheng respectively (Gao Cai and Guo Wensheng were seriously burned), and heard Leng Jun&#39;s voice at Mikami Pass, and then returned and took Lu Xiang to the +290m water pump room, and Call the dispatch office to report the incident. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Accident rescue process&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After receiving the accident report, dispatcher Meng Fanjun reported the accident to mine director Li Yonghai. Yonghai immediately reported the situation to mine investor Wang Haoming and legal representative Cong Peifu, and arranged for Li Tao and Huo Jianguo to organize personnel to go down the mine to carry out rescue. The rescuers met Lu Xiang, Zhang Chengxue, Ji Yaomin, Guo Wensheng, Huang Fujun and Zhang Yong and other survivors, and sent people to escort them to the well. At the same time, a person (Yang Lianpeng) was found buried in coal at the fan switch, with only one leg exposed. He was confirmed dead at the scene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rescuers found a fall at the Sishang Pass. They checked that the carbon monoxide concentration on the inside of the Sishang Pass was 999ppm (portable multi-function detector range 0~999ppm), the gas concentration was 0.1%, and the oxygen concentration was 5%. All people on the mountain were believed to have died, and the search for rescuers continued. When we arrived at Sanshang Pass, coal fell and blocked the tunnel. We found 4 people calling for help in Sanshang Mountain. We immediately cleared the coal and entered Sanshang Mountain to rescue the seriously injured Gao Cai and Li Junsheng. Then we lifted out Zhang Qinglong, who could not stand on his right leg, and finally Rescue Leng Jun and escort him to the surface. At 18:10, all survivors had reached the ground and were sent to hospitals for treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At 18:40, rescue workers began to clear the pile of coal where Yang Lianpeng died, and pulled out the body and transported it to the ground. Then the carbon monoxide was discharged section by section up the mountain. When the discharge reached 13 meters from the mountain pass, the deceased Wang Hongchang was found. The gas continued to be discharged, and the victims Wang Junfu and Sun Cheng were found about 1 meter below the shelter. So far, all the bodies of the victims have been found and transported to the ground. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Direct reasons&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;+290m East Shimensi Mountain is connected to the +355m goaf area, and gas surges in the goaf area out; one local ventilator was used to supply air to three working locations at the same time. The air volume was insufficient, causing gas accumulation, and the workers fired cannons in violation of regulations, leading to accidents. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;The accident concealment process&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After the accident, Wang Haoming, the investor and actual controller of Jikun Coal Mine, arranged for the mine manager Li Yonghai organized the rescue on his own without reporting to the emergency department; arranged for Wang Zhenshan and Wang Weidong to treat the injured and the aftermath of the deceased; arranged for Cong Peifu to assist the mine manager in handling the accident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Weidong sent four seriously injured people to the Hunjiang District Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, and then transferred them to the First Affiliated Hospital of Jilin University in Changchun City. Four workers who felt unwell were sent to Tonghua City Hospital for inhalation. Oxygen therapy. Wang Zhenshan sent the four victims to the Jiangyuan District Cemetery Funeral Home, Jiangyuan District Ni Tai Hospital, Sanchazi Forestry Bureau Hospital Morgue, and Textile Factory Funeral Home, and reached a compensation agreement with the families of the victims. Subsequently, he purchased two &quot;Medical Certificates of Resident Death (Presumption)&quot; (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Death Certificates&quot;) from Wang Yonghai, director of the textile factory funeral home, for 50,000 yuan each, resulting in the illegal disposal of the remains of the two deceased persons. At the same time, Wang Zhenshan arranged for personnel to delete video surveillance data related to the accident on the afternoon of April 5, deliberately concealing the accident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At around 2:00 on April 3, after the on-site rescue work was completed, Li Yonghai arranged for Guan Yanlin to lead the ventilation team members into the well, and at the original sealed position of +290m East Shimen and +355m return air alley. Construct a &quot;quick seal&quot; to seal the accident scene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Concealing the verification process&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 23:00 on April 2, Baishan City Emergency Management Bureau, Jilin Provincial Emergency Management Department, and Provincial Party Committee Inspection Team have successively received reports about the Jikun Coal Mine accident. report. On April 3, the Baishan City Emergency Management Bureau took the lead in setting up a joint verification team with the Jiangyuan District Emergency Management Bureau to verify the reported cases, inspected the safety monitoring system, personnel location monitoring system and video surveillance system, and conducted a review of the April 2 incident. During the day shift, 52 people working in the well were questioned and collected evidence. As of April 13, the inspection team found no signs of a gas accident in Jikun Coal Mine, and evidence collection from those who entered the mine on duty showed that no accident occurred in Jikun Coal Mine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of April 13, in accordance with the spirit of the Baishan Municipal Party Committee meeting on April 12, the relevant leaders of the Baishan City and Jiangyuan District governments took the lead and organized the Public Security Bureau, Emergency Management Bureau and other departments to establish a joint verification team. , conduct in-depth verification of reported matters.

(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Halloween has passed, but the &quot;Ten Thousand Stem Festival&quot; has not. This large-scale carnival still has lingering warmth in the metropolis of Shanghai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;November 1st every year is the traditional Western festival of Halloween. The most lively moment is on Halloween, when children dress up as various cute ghosts, knock on doors and do trick-or-treating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Halloween in Shanghai in 2023 comes earlier. Starting from October 28, the city switches to the magical side. Major theme parks and some Internet celebrity bars will hold Halloween activities, as well as spontaneous street parties. Monsters and monsters of different shapes appeared on the street. What is unexpected is that Internet memes with a strong Chinese style have suddenly emerged and become popular all over the Internet. They are dubbed as a new trend of &quot;Renaissance&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the lanterns come on, an ordinary old street can turn into a movable feast. It will be a fairy tale world where you can cosplay various characters and experience another identity; it can be a channel to release stress and express yourself; it can also be a traffic pool full of temptations. The cosplayers in the pool are eye-catching enough, and there are precedents for Xiti’s hot search lists on major platforms, which means that traffic and money will have the opportunity to be included in the bag. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters interviewed more than a dozen &quot;crazy citizens&quot;. According to them, Shanghai has not been this lively for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On October 30, the Julu Road area was crowded with people. Visual China&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11 /03/66c8c013f9.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/66c8c013f9.jpg &quot; data-key=&quot;256937&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 30, the Julu Road area was crowded with people. (Visual China/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Pure happiness&quot; on Julu Road&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After leaving the subway station, the flow of people under the bright yellow lights was surging in one direction. Even without navigation, you can determine the general direction of Julu Road. The closer you get there, the denser the crowds will be. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The location with the strongest Halloween atmosphere is Julu Road in Huangpu District, Shanghai. This is a commercial street named after the giant cruise ship &quot;Julu&quot; of the French Post Line. There are many exotic and Western-style shops. Historical buildings spread across this prosperous area. The most iconic one is the Sunken Plaza at No. 158 Julu Road, which has always been the most popular place to visit on Halloween. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of October 31st, the night in Shanghai was getting darker and the carnival began. There is Tathagata Buddha riding a shared bicycle inadvertently passing by, exuding golden light; there is a zombie bride and the fire ghost king who are all dressed in red; there is also Lu Xun in a long robe, lamenting that studying medicine cannot save the Chinese people ; Pretending to be a potted plant, acting out a famous painting, or even raising a middle finger in a headband can create a bizarre landscape... The journey from Julu Road to Fuxing Park, less than 1 kilometer away, is packed with people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The level of crowding made police nervous. The entrance to Julu Road has been blocked by police with iron railings, and blue and red police lights are flashing everywhere. While maintaining order, the traffic police repeatedly emphasized: &quot;I am not a cosplayer.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even the fence could not stop the enthusiastic flow of people. They took a shortcut from the nearby green slope about ten meters and sneaked into Julu road. Southern Weekend reporters followed the flow of people up the slope. Looking from above, Julu Road looked like a colorful light strip. The crowds of people almost filled the entire space on the road and flowed slowly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The adjacent Chengdu South Road disperses some of the flow of people overflowing from Julu Road. Relatively speaking, this place is a lot ordinary. There are two or three-story private houses on both sides of the road, full of clothing stores, leather bag stalls, taverns and fly restaurants. A restaurant owner sitting on the street is surrounded by a crowd of people. &quot;Normally there are not many people here.&quot; Here, from last Saturday until now, there are many people in the store.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you take a few steps, you will see large and small black and white impermanences. They hold long red tongues. On their black and white high hats are written &quot;Peace in the world&quot; and &quot;Wealth at first sight&quot;. , including many children wearing thick black eye shadow and looking cute. At the corner, I met the White Snake and Fahai living in harmony. The masked men from the popular Korean drama &quot;Squid Game&quot; stood in a row against the wall and obediently cooperated with tourists to take photos. It had nothing to do with horror. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most eye-catching people at the scene were the boys cosplaying Batman. They were tall and tall, with black masks covering their eyes, clear mandibles and indifferent expressions. From time to time, girls around him would scream, &quot;So handsome.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Batmans have been touring twice, always causing commotion at the scene. Their trump card is to take off their tight tops and expose their porcelain chest muscles if they disagree. Circle after circle of people gathered around to cheer. The tourists on the outside couldn&#39;t see it. They just stood on tiptoe and pointed their raised mobile phones towards the center to take pictures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Within only three seconds, the Batmans were pushed out of the crowd by the police, and there was a burst of laughter from the crowd. This is a routine operation to maintain order on Halloween. People and &quot;ghosts&quot; causing congestion will be taken away by the police and moved to another place to ease the flow of people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Batman Strong Man.

Photo by Li Zixuan&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A God of Wealth holding a gold ingot was undoubtedly respected. There was a long queue of tourists taking photos. Some people clasped their hands and bowed their heads in worship to the God of Wealth, begging her to bless them with good fortune. For about half an hour, the God of Wealth was blocked and did not move a step. The gold ingot was touched here and there. Every time he wanted to leave, he was pulled back by the person who took the photo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The faces of the elderly also appeared in the crowd, and they were also very busy. Maybe it’s because “I can’t understand it, but I’m very shocked.” An elderly man sighed, “We also get to know the things of young people. It’s lively, fun, and fresh.”&lt;/p>; &lt; p>; &quot;Don&#39;t you think this is a release? A release of stress.&quot; Another Shanghai uncle talked to a Southern Weekend reporter. He had been standing on the roadside for two hours, observing and feeling the carnival atmosphere. My uncle is from Shanghai, but he has never seen such an atmosphere. &quot;I am very happy to see such an atmosphere. I think everyone is also happy from the bottom of their hearts. This is not a festival. Everyone is just using the festival as an excuse to be happy.&quot; , pure joy.” &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Go crazy together and release stress”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;A novel scene appeared at the subway entrance near Julu Road. Many people gathered together to exchange professional opinions. So much so that the subway entrance was blocked again. Some said they were studying law, some were studying civil engineering, and some were studying architecture. Everyone complained that it was difficult to get along in the corresponding industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What resonated strongly was the boy Xiao Xie who was surrounded. He looked haggard and had pale lips. The card hanging on his chest had four big words written on it: Studying Architecture. He was also carrying a bag with two wads of toilet paper. take-out box, looking impoverished. &quot;It is true that this industry is not very prosperous, and my work is not going well, so I take this opportunity to go crazy together.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Everyone is going crazy, and I want to go crazy too. It feels so good, and I put all my inner thoughts into it.&quot; Release the pressure.&quot; Xiao Xie just did a bold thing and resigned naked in October 2023. It was a period of work where &quot;I couldn&#39;t move even if I wanted to curl up, but I didn&#39;t dare to lie down&quot;. Everyone didn&#39;t dare to leave their seats after get off work, and they were chased by their leaders to make work demands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The migrant worker who is even more out of the circle is Li Qiubai, the actor of Party B who wanders the same street. His makeup was rough and exaggerated, and the dark eye shadow and highlighter applied to his face made it look like his cheekbones were protruding and his cheeks were sunken. He had an A4 paper with &quot;Party B&quot; written on it in the collar of his checkered shirt, clearly showing a person who had been squeezed by Party A for a long time. haggard beat worker. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Party B coser.

Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I cosplayed a character who had just finished his shift, and I didn’t expect the effect to be so good.” Li Qiubai had indeed just finished his shift, and it was already late at night when he arrived at Julu Road, so he decided to perform a Party B, who was tired, was constantly surrounded by people taking photos. The number of views on his social account has &quot;exploded&quot;, and many netizens have left messages expressing sympathy. &quot;Some people read the jokes, and some people look in the mirror. There are many comments like this.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Maybe it&#39;s because after the epidemic, there is no such activity that everyone can enjoy. Although the previous festivals were holidays, various tickets were not available.&quot; Li Qiubai said that now it has reached a In a festival where everyone can go crazy, I have an outlet to vent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here, Li Qiubai also encountered many poor people who did not need to dress up, as well as the resentful Party A. Some people held up signs: &quot;People who usually have a hard time pretending to be themselves don&#39;t need to dress up for Halloween.&quot; It&#39;s OK.&quot; Li Qiubai summed up this type of cosplay as: using realistic expression techniques to present the things that workers fear most. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of October 31st, many cosplayers said they came over right after get off work. A King Zhou finished putting on a solemn dramatic face in his company, and walked around the streets to find two strangers, Daji, to form a CP; a 28-year-old young man drove here from Jiaxing City, Zhejiang Province, and she cosplayed Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s classic animated character, the Faceless Man, stood hunched silently on the roadside, with more than a hundred people gathered around to take a group photo. Because she had to go to work the next day, she returned to Jiaxing overnight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Gongzi chose to release herself in another way. She played the role of SpongeBob SquarePants, who is also 37 years old. On weekdays, she is engaged in the company&#39;s business work, talking about cost-effectiveness and the company&#39;s maximum benefits. But before Halloween comes, the homemade yellow felt board square shell makes her purely the embodiment of happiness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Mr. Wang cosplayed Spongebob Squarepants into Happy Valley, he immediately became the center of attention and was even mistaken by tourists for being a professional staff member of the park. A crowd of chirping children followed her, stuffing her with candies and throwing out a hundred thousand whys: Did Mr. Krabs give you a day off? Why don&#39;t you bring Xiaowei to play with you? What’s the secret ingredient to the Krusty Krab? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That night, Mr. Wang said, the whole group went crazy. Di Dixi, a colleague cosplaying as a Haidilao waiter, was originally a typical i person (referring to an introvert). In this atmosphere, she was directly reshaped into an e person (referring to an extrovert). She would take the initiative to get in front of some tourists. There is no real thing to do in the crazy performance, just twisting the hands in the air, but it is self-intoxicating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That night, Di Dixi also interviewed &quot;Li Jiaqi&quot;, a cosplayer who sells eyebrow pencils for 79 yuan. The other person responded in a long voice, &quot;Why is it so expensive? It&#39;s always the same price. It&#39;s really annoying.&quot; Dixi burst into laughter on the spot. Later, this video unexpectedly went viral. Prince Wang and his friends were all shocked. Is the Sheniu girl in front of them the same Didixi who dared not speak in front of others and pretended to be immersed in looking at her mobile phone? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;She became more aggressive after she woke up the next day. Looking back, she felt so embarrassed and a little bit ashamed.&quot; Didisi&#39;s friend recalled to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Within a few days, Didixi led her two friends who were smarter than herself and headed towards Julu Road. She put on heavy makeup and went back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;There are people on the street who cosplay and learn computers.

In 2022, he was dressed like An Lingrong and danced on roller skates, which made him a hot search. After all, &quot;The Legend of Zhen Huan&quot; is the &quot;electronic mustard&quot; for all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this sea of ​​folk joy, Halloween has also become a traffic carnival, with many video teams wandering around. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“She is so hot.” ​​A Ying, who cosplayed An Lingrong’s Maid, was a little proud. She told Southern Weekend reporters that after deciding to perform the scene of “An Lingrong singing on the bow”, several commercials A team of people made careful planning and posted a &quot;thaw&quot; trailer on the short video platform, implying An Lingrong&#39;s return. They also made a video invitation with a route plan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“What we are looking for is Lalamove to drag the prop boat over. As soon as it got off the cargo puller, many people called An Lingrong.” On the evening of October 28, An Lingrong was sitting on the boat. As soon as he came out, he was surrounded by a crowd of people, which directly diverted the traffic of other nearby cosplayers. They put on cheap wigs and the same costumes as in the play. An Lingrong on the bow of the boat was holding a lotus. The music &quot;Lotus Can Be Picked in Jiangnan&quot; was played on the Bluetooth speaker, and everyone sang along. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The number of likes for the short video shot by the team at that time soared to tens of thousands. When it came to Fuxing Park for the second time, thousands of people watched the live broadcast. &quot;It&#39;s quite fun. Everyone came up with a lot of creative ideas. I finally saw how relaxed the people in Shanghai are.&quot; A Ying said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An Lingrong’s previous appearance in the industry also inspired the Hangzhou boy Xingxing. In this Halloween, he became popular with his cosplay of Xiang Tai. In one of his most widely circulated videos, Xingxing is wearing a pink coat that the team temporarily bought for 400 yuan, looking rich and wealthy. Someone asked him what he thought of Xiangtai&#39;s daughter-in-law Guo Biting. He smiled slightly and imitated: &quot;It&#39;s easy to control.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In response, Xiangtai himself responded from a distance: &quot;The clothes are too low, he should imitate Make it more beautiful.&quot; This shocked the Xingxing team. Originally, everyone joked that the Halloween cosplay star lineup would be enough to receive letters from lawyers from all the celebrities on the Internet, but it was so popular that people were still caught off guard. &quot;We were actually a little scared, afraid that if the Xiangzuo team came to us and asked us if we had any problems, but in the end they only said to interact, then we went to interact.&quot; Ami, a staff member of the Xingxing team, told a Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ami introduced that Xingxing is a self-media beauty blogger. After causing trouble with Taizhuang, many cooperative merchants approached us, &quot;Many people sent us private messages to discuss cooperation. We should wake up We woke up and pretended to interact with each other, but we refused because we were afraid of being scolded.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people were worried and some were happy. After seeing Xiang Tai and An Lingrong become popular on the Internet, Na Ying, the actor who plays Na Ying, was also moved. &quot;Then I have to go.&quot; On November 1, she imitated Na Ying&#39;s tone on the other end of the phone when being interviewed by a Southern Weekend reporter. Previously, she bought the clothes of Li Minglang in &quot;The Wife&#39;s Secret&quot;, the lowest version of sunglasses, hairpins and a microphone, and went to Julu Road for three nights in a row, imitating Na Ying and constantly uttering &quot;that language&quot;, &quot;I&#39;m a Open your mouth and they will howl and scream.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The results are immediate. This British version of Na Ying brings traffic wherever he goes. Even if he puts on a mask, takes off his glasses, or puts on friends&#39; clothes, he will still be recognized. He has experienced the treatment of a star being chased. &quot;They thought I was the real Na Ying. Everyone screamed, saying it looked too much like me. They shouted, &#39;That sister, don&#39;t run away,&#39; and &#39;That sister, take a picture of me.&#39;&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Before I went, I I knew I would be out of the circle, but I was just not sure to what extent.&quot; In three days, Naying&#39;s Douyin followers increased by nearly 100,000, and she held on to her traffic password tightly, &quot;After I got home on Halloween night, I still I started a live broadcast, hoping to take advantage of the popularity to gain some followers.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the carnival on October 31, a roar suddenly made the noisy crowd pause. &quot;Aren&#39;t you going to let people pass?&quot; A delivery boy who was stuck in the crowd got angry, and his wheels were unable to move at this moment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the atmosphere soon recovered. Scenes like this were no stranger. From time to time, a delivery boy shouted in the excited crowd: &quot;Give way, it&#39;s timeout, it&#39;s timeout.&quot; In this moment of discussion. In a carnival where it is not clear whether it is true or false, it is difficult not to suspect that they are cosplaying with the delivery boy. During the interview, some people also cast doubtful looks at Southern Weekend reporters and asked, &quot;Are you a cosplay reporter?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Until midnight, the flow of people on Julu Road gradually died down. After this night, Shanghai will return to the tense and rhythmic side of the metropolis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ The names of the interviewees in this article are pseudonyms)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https:// feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 10:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[划着轮椅，出门去]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259854]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-04 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/01/Xm69IGLIOY0RdqFGd0x7xHAkdl2sxvVquGUPdTNq.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/Xm69IGLIOY0RdqFGd0x7xHAkdl2sxvV quGUPdTNq. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256503&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tianye in his Chuanchuan store picture/provided by MYBank Charity Store Alliance&lt; span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sea is blue and you can&#39;t see the edge at a glance. To the outside is a beach filled with vacationers. Further outward is the main road, which is flat and wide. A wheelchair is coming from a distance and is moving from the asphalt road to the seaside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is Sanya, Hainan. The soft and fine sand shows high quality, but it is a challenge for wheelchairs. The wheels of the wheelchair sank easily, and Ye Ye sat on it. Someone had to pull him backwards and forward so that he could move slowly. Little by little, and then little by little, the beach and the sea came to the young man at a slower speed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most difficult situation when going out is that you often have to wait, &quot;waiting for someone to help you show up.&quot; Tian Tian recalled the journey with me several times. For example, from the main road to the beach, a half-meter-high iron railing blocked his eyes. Others could step over it in one go, but he could not. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Skating, playing, and driving, before the age of 17, the young man from Xi&#39;an was very active in the fields and saw a future that was &quot;omnipotent.&quot; In 2004, an accidental car accident caused him to become a high-level paraplegic and he could only sit in a wheelchair since then. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While waiting passively, he and other &quot;injured friends&quot; in wheelchairs encouraged each other and went out to draw a map of barrier-free facilities within the third ring road of Xi&#39;an&#39;s main city. Mark the existing problems and open the way out. It took 3 months, 4 wheelchairs, and 15 hours a day to create a barrier-free map of 597 square kilometers. Thousands of marks were made in three color categories, covering all the main roads in the Third Ring Road of Xi&#39;an. The relevant departments cleaned up accordingly. Obstacles, more ways out appear in the eyes of people with disabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Along the way, they have encountered a lot of criticism, &quot;Why can&#39;t we just take a detour? Why do we have to take this road?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I didn&#39;t want to take a shortcut, I just wanted to Take the original path.&quot; Tian Ye sat in a wheelchair and repeated this answer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/H8IgQNi0WPgEHVQguJObawbf6qFhz4KA5xiCCPJJ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;541&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/H8IgQNi0WPgEHVQguJObawbf6qFhz4KA5xiCCPJJ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256495&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Injured Friends&quot; push wheelchairs together on the barrier-free passage Picture/Microfilm &quot;Hey, Come Out&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span >;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Precise physical needs&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;One wheelchair met another wheelchair, more and more, five or six people driving wheelchairs gathered in the open field, &quot;Hey , come out!&quot; After a simple greeting, they started the competition - wheelchair racing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The track is very long and needs to go through some barrier-free passages. Slight irregularities on the road may cause the wheelchair to slow down or even pause. This is the road they have driven on countless times in wheelchairs. Irregularities were marked, fed back, and resolved one by one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the race is over, they will meet for a meal at a Chuanchuan restaurant in Tianye. There, people with disabilities receive a 50% discount on dining, and it is a regular gathering place for &quot;injured friends&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But for several days, I never waited for such a scene. In mid-September, it was the rainy season in Xi&#39;an. The rain lasted for more than ten days, separating the previous summer from the following winter. &quot;There is no autumn in Xi&#39;an,&quot; the locals say. The weather turned from hot to cold in the blink of an eye, leaving no time for preparation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even after living in Xi&#39;an for decades, the &quot;injured friends&quot; still feel uncomfortable even with slight changes in the weather. When the rain comes, they can&#39;t get out even more. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s not easy to get together. They are slowly getting used to it, just like many details in life, they need to adapt again and find a new order in time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They need precise control over their physical needs. For example, drinking water, the simplest thing, needs to be done regularly, quantitatively, and managed accurately. Otherwise, it will be impossible to control the timing of defecation and defecation, which will make it more difficult to go out. It is impossible not to drink water. Some people have tried it to treat bladder system infections and urinary tract infections. Problems will ensue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/UlsQrXIjBHgH2o9TqtQrZZpjwhsb6zBL2GZwJCRj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/UlsQrXIjBHgH2o9TqtQrZZpjwhsb6zBL2GZwJCRj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256500&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;After the filming of the micro-film was completed, Tian Ye and the crew took a group photo&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the Online Merchant Bank Charity Store Alliance)&lt;/span >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The speed of drinking water must also be controlled. If you drink too fast or too hard, the water will flow from the throat to the bladder too quickly, and errors will occur. A five-minute time difference will be enough for a wheelchair when going out. It could mean an accident lasting more than two hours. The two-hour trip was compact: find a suitable spot, clean yourself up, then open the door and walk onto the street, pretending that nothing had happened. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Developing a tacit understanding with the body requires coping with seasonal changes. For example, in summer and winter, people sweat differently, and the corresponding drinking patterns are naturally different. The exploration of every tiny pattern comes from the fact that &quot;injured friends&quot; cannot resist the temptation to go out deep in their hearts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 50% discount skewers shop opened by Tian Ye is also one of the temptations for &quot;injured friends&quot; to go out. When he was 17 years old, he suffered an accidental car accident and became paraplegic. He relied on a wheelchair to travel and became a member of the &quot;Injured Friends&quot; circle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first time I saw Tianye was at his home. Urinary tract infection is one of the common diseases among injured people. Tian Tian has just returned from the hospital for infusion. He is sitting in a wheelchair, his body tilted to one side, and the tail end of his speech hangs on the ground, with the exhaustion of struggling to maintain his strength. He has sneakers on his feet, and he needs help from time to time to move him, making sure he is on the pedals of his wheelchair. When chatting for a long time, he needs to move. The effect of gravity will make his feet more and more uncomfortable until he asks the people around him for help. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the time, this person is his father. &quot;Dad, drink water.&quot; &quot;Dad, Coke.&quot; There is no need to thank you, explain, or any other reason. A long time will reduce such a conversation to the most direct expression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ye Ye lives in Qujiang New District, Xi&#39;an City, where there is an average of one public restroom every few hundred meters, equipped with barrier-free restrooms. Tian Ye sat in an electric wheelchair and drove skillfully to a public restroom near his home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Open the door of the barrier-free bathroom. The facilities inside are complete. There are facilities where babies can be placed on horizontal boards while they lie down to change diapers, and there are facilities where babies can be fixedly seated on one side for parents to use the toilet. There are also facilities with handrails for people with disabilities to use the toilet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, only those who actually use it can feel the subtle differences. Tian Ye pushed his wheelchair and walked to the mirror. He couldn&#39;t see himself in the neat and clean half-length mirror. Tian Tian explained that the mirror needs to have a certain tilt so that you can see your face from a low position. I tried to bend down and lower my head so that my line of sight was at the same height as his head in the wheelchair. I no longer dare to call it a &quot;slight&quot; difference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two sides of the barrier-free passage leading from the main road to the bathroom are not smooth, but standing aside, you can&#39;t tell the abnormality. &quot;Both sides are uneven,&quot; Tian Ye&#39;s father measured it with his hands. The relevant road regulations stipulate that the error cannot exceed 2 centimeters. &quot;Within 1 centimeter (error) does not affect the wheelchair going up and down, but there is at least a 5 centimeter error on this road.&quot; Until Tian Ye&#39;s wheelchair slowly moved up, it pushed hard several times. If I don&#39;t get up, a sudden acceleration may cause it to roll over. Only then do I realize what the slightest difference in sight means to a wheelchair. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tian Ye then explained the classification of the blind walk he just walked through: there are two types of blind walk bricks. The strip-shaped ones are guide bricks, which guide the blind people to move forward safely and securely. These are called marching blind walk bricks; the other kind They are dot-shaped reminder bricks that are used to remind blind people that there are obstacles ahead and they should make a turn. These are called blind trail bricks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I didn&#39;t understand anything before,&quot; Tian Ye smiled and began to recall the point where he &quot;understood&quot;, which was an accidental car accident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/wQfffxl6KOaODmI8pg8ZKFKJx3CfUGGQw8fThb3J.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/wQfffxl6KOaODmI8pg8ZKFKJx3CfUGGQw8fThb3J.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256502&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tianye’s Chuanchuan shop has become a gathering place for &quot;injured friends&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the Online Merchant Bank Charity Store Alliance/Picture )&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;A show for everyone&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The gray-white Santana passed by, and the license plate number stayed in Tianye’s heart, and he could still blurt it out many years later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the car passed by, life in the field was &quot;moving&quot;. He was born in 1987, and his ancestors have lived near the Big Wild Goose Pagoda in Xi&#39;an for generations. Tian Ye has been naughty and active since he was a child, and likes to watch martial arts movies. The famous scene of &quot;The Lion King&#39;s Fight for Hegemony&quot; in &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; starring Jet Li left a deep impression on him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, he went to a martial arts school and practiced martial arts for two full years from the age of 13 to 15. When he was young, he loved roller skating. He was always the best and fastest skater. At that time, there was a popular game called &quot;train driving&quot;. A group of people were dragged forward and backward, sometimes straight, sometimes diagonally, changing formations. The person driving first was called the &quot;locomotive&quot; and asked whether the train was fast or not. &quot;It all depends on the head.&quot; Tian Tian always plays the role of the locomotive. With a background in martial arts school, his speed, balance and strength are outstanding, &quot;like autumn leaves falling in the air&quot;, he can do side flips and splits easily, and he can pull more than a hundred people while pulling a train. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, I stopped studying and learning martial arts. I drove a bulldozer and repaired cars in the field. At the construction site, except for tower cranes, he has driven all other &quot;cars&quot; that can be seen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This speed stopped when I was 17 years old. In 2004, Tianye was involved in a car accident. After saving his life, he stayed in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) for 21 days, which cost him no idea how much money he spent. Then he lay in bed for another eight months, becoming skin and bones. It was the most painful period in his life. Tian Ye recalled that at that time, he was over 1.7 meters tall and weighed only 70 to 80 kilograms. His ribs were clearly visible, and he could be seen clearly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the next 10 years, his parents took him to seek medical advice everywhere, including specialist hospitals and charlatans. I don’t know how many folk remedies and secret recipes have been tried, money was spent, and hardships were endured, but the person failed to stand up. &quot;Kaizi (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;local dialect, meaning &#39;fool&#39;&lt;/span>;) was deceived, and Dangdang was different,&quot; Tian Ye lamented the state of the family at that time , unwilling to accept the facts, always feel that I can still stand up, and I should be able to stand up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unable to find an exit in reality, Tianye kept a dream in his heart. In the dream, he entered a temple. Many monks were meditating and knocking wooden fish. He knelt in front of the Buddha statue. Suddenly the door of the Main Hall opened, and with a golden light, an old monk came in. He said to Tian Tian, ​​&quot;You should have gone to hell.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tian Tian was puzzled and asked crying, &quot;I am so kind, why not What terrible bad things have you done? Why do I have to go to hell? Why do I have to sit in a wheelchair?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The monk replied, &quot;Sitting in a wheelchair is already very good. You were going to hell.&quot; The monk was in the air Drawing a circle, it looked like a TV. In it, Tianye saw that he was a prince. He ran into a temple during the fighting and knocked off the head of a Bodhisattva statue with a wooden stick. After reading it, Tian Ye cried loudly in his dream and continued to cry when he woke up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After crying, although the dream was illusory, Tian Ye seemed to have found some reason for comfort outside of reality. He was no longer confused, no longer felt targeted by fate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When talking about the node of change, Tian Ye pondered for a while and talked about &quot;mission.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;What is your mission?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I am performing a play, and the audience is everyone. I used to be a very naughty child, and I had an accident. Some people say that it is retribution, or karma, because I was too naughty before, and others would use me to educate their children. At first I felt disgusted, but later I was happy, and my experience became the opposite of what parents should do to educate their children. Textbook - &#39;Don&#39;t learn from Tianye&#39;. From here, I slowly found the direction of my life and was no longer lonely.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tianye decided to open a skewers shop. It was first opened in a community. In May 2013, from eight briquette stoves, an umbrella, and a few benches, to sixty or seventy stoves, sheds, and prefabricated houses, it &quot;became stylish.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/HhSWrv4fr2rlVImIZRyMe3AFC0sx4JLiDOIl0a8O.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/HhSWrv4fr2rlVImIZRyMe3AFC0sx4JLiDOIl0a8O.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256499&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the summer of 2021, Tianye and &quot;injured friends&quot; experienced barrier-free facilities at Qujiangnan Lake in Xi&#39;an&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewees/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2021, the store moved to a shop about 1 km away from home. &quot;That was the best time for business.&quot; The 120-square-meter store can accommodate hundreds of tables every day, and there are so many people that it can&#39;t accommodate them. Half a year later, the store expanded again, and Tian Tian changed the lease to a 300-square-meter store next door. In the middle of the month after the move, cases of new coronavirus pneumonia appeared in Xi&#39;an. In November 2021, Tianye&#39;s Chuanchuan store closed just after it opened. For the entire year of 2022, the store was closed for 180 days and suffered a loss of hundreds of thousands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By 2023, Tian Ye thought that the epidemic was gone, policies were relaxed, and everything would get better, but business has slowed down. In mid-September when we met, the store was being renovated, and Tianye wanted to use a new look to welcome back its former prosperity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Should the new store install a barrier-free bathroom?&quot; I looked at him and asked at another rice noodle shop in Tianye. This rice noodle shop may not be able to open anymore. Tian Tian wants to alleviate some of the financial pressure so that he can start it again in the future. The rice noodle shop&#39;s rent expense is about 90,000 yuan a year, and its business is not doing well. He analyzed that it is because the location is not good. While we were chatting in front of the store, light rain fell from time to time. This store is sandwiched behind an office building. There are several fast food restaurants nearby. The business is not very good. There are few pedestrians on the street on rainy days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said that he had considered installing a barrier-free bathroom, but it was still unrealistic. Fortunately and conveniently, there is a public restroom about 100 meters away from the Chuanchuan store. There are barrier-free facilities there to facilitate &quot;injured friends&quot; to solve toilet problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the store opened, people with disabilities will receive a 15% discount when they come to the Chuanchuan store in Tianye. In May 2021, the MYbank Charity Store Alliance was established, and Tianye’s Chuanchuan store joined. With the support of MYbank, it launched a set meal activity for people with disabilities to eat skewers at half price. Wang Ye is the initiator of this charity store project. She introduced that the main users of the platform are small shop owners. While doing this charity project, she wanted to know who the “shopkeepers” were. During the epidemic at that time, Wang Ye first came into contact with the owner of a dumpling restaurant in Xi&#39;an. Some people came to Xi&#39;an to look for jobs but could not find jobs and had spent all their money. The boss posted a piece of paper at the door to the effect of &quot;It&#39;s no big deal if you have difficulties. Come in.&quot; Eat a bowl of dumplings for free.&quot; The charity shop project gave the dumpling shop owner a subsidy of 10,000 yuan. &quot;How can there be such a sincere person? He is obviously very difficult.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, Wang Ye discovered Tianye&#39;s Chuan Chuan shop and also gave him 10,000 yuan in support. &quot;Injured friends can eat Chuan Chuan at 50% off.&quot; ” activity is online. Wang Ye&#39;s task is to find 1,000 such stores across the country. &quot;1,000 is our upper limit. We don&#39;t look for people who are determined to do charity from the beginning, because it will be difficult to persist. We look for people who are already in the normal business.&quot; run.&quot; After contacting many such small charity shops, Wang Ye lamented that charity does not rely on emotional impulse. It requires a sense of purpose and values ​​​​in the heart. It cannot be a temporary passion, but must always be a belief, &quot;I Know what I&#39;m doing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/HRxm6HYZRBJQrPvguHMPfH6yDPutZ5LttZbHWl4j.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/HRxm6HYZRBJQrPvguHMPfH6yDPutZ5LttZbHWl4j.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256497&quot;>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;During the filming of the micro-film, director Wang Ye (first from left) and the injured experienced wheelchair travel&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Photo provided by MYBank Charity Store Alliance)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Leave it to time to present&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In addition to Chuan Chuan store, Ye Ye and the wounded friends’ charity territory “It’s also about creating an accessibility map. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2018, Tian Ye and six people with disabilities he met jointly raised funds to establish the &quot;SCI Wingless Flying&quot; charity center. &quot;You want to fly even if you don&#39;t have wings&quot; is their original intention of establishing &quot;Wingless Flight&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the establishment of &quot;Wingless Flying&quot;, Ye Ye and the wounded friends spent three months conducting a road barrier-free environment survey within the third ring road in Xi&#39;an. The idea was originally proposed by &quot;wounded friend&quot; Huang Yuan of. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huang Yuan, 52 years old, was involved in a car accident in July 2011. The 9th to 12th ribs of his chest were injured. Since then, he has needed to use a wheelchair to travel. In a wheelchair, he ran a half-marathon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to going out with &quot;injured friends&quot;, he feels less pressure. The most difficult thing may be the problem of temporary toileting. For example, if you cannot control your bowels and bowels well, especially stool, you have to return home or clean yourself little by little in the accessible toilet, which can take an hour or two. &quot;Injured friends&quot; can completely understand each other with a look or a word. They can give full understanding without explanation, because they have &quot;equal bodies.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most serious problem with his body is that he has no feeling. His thigh swelled three times its original size after going out once, and the injury was not discovered until then. The scar on the right leg was left in May 2022 and is still not healed. He rolled up his trouser legs, and there were deep and shallow scars on his uneven calves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to going out, Huang Yuan is always full of smiles. &quot;Injured friends&quot; drove wheelchairs on the road to observe, and if they found any problems with barrier-free facilities, they took photos and sent them to Huang Yuan, collecting tens of thousands of photos. Huang Yuan finally selected the 5,000 available photos and made them into an electronic map. This requires a lot of behind-the-scenes work, such as reversely reading the coordinates from the GPS, then mapping the photos to the corresponding locations and marking them with markers of different colors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This electronic map is distinguished by different layers: one is divided according to administrative regions, and the other is classified according to reasons, including irregular design, inadequate construction, and later damage and loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on Huang Yuan’s experience, most of the design plans are in place because there are standard drawings. However, during the construction and supervision and acceptance processes, problems sometimes occur and &quot;look-alikes&quot; appear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After three months of research, Huang Yuan compiled the &quot;Investigation Report on the Status of Accessible Facilities in Xi&#39;an&quot; and produced a special electronic map of the distribution of accessibility problems in Xi&#39;an, clearly marking every existence Location, image representation, cause category, etc. of accessibility issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The results of the investigation were sent to the relevant road administration departments by email, and some of the problems were corrected. The map and report are still kept in Huang Yuan&#39;s computer, even though the &quot;Public Welfare Center&quot; is currently unable to maintain due to insufficient funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The complete investigation was not there at the beginning. It was initially a sporadic &quot;love post&quot;. Liu Sifang took out a pile from under the coffee table. The pink post-it note had the words &quot;I am a disabled person and your vehicle blocks the barrier-free passage&quot; printed on it. He also had a pile in his wheelchair backpack and took it with him when he went out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Sifang is 60 years old this year. When he was 50 years old, he suffered from a vascular attack and leaked his carotid artery. The doctor told him that there were no more than 50 cases of people suffering from this rare disease worldwide. In 2014, he underwent surgery at Xi&#39;an Medical College, and his life since then has been inseparable from crutches and wheelchairs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Sifang keeps several parrots at home. They fly around the room, sometimes landing on their shoulders and sometimes on their heads, adding a bit of life. He gave these birds names, which was a lot of fun at home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When talking about making love stickers and barrier-free access maps, Liu Sifang mentioned, &quot;It is to find a reason to go out.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was originally a sporadic love sticker, but later it hurt Friends thought, &quot;Forget it, just run by yourself and be a whole person.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The people who check and accept are not disabled.&quot; When talking about the problems encountered in using barrier-free facilities, Liu Sifang has more options Understand: You will encounter non-compliant &quot;slope problems&quot;, and some make barrier-free passages into gravel roads, maybe for the sake of appearance, but small-wheel wheelchairs cannot go there, so you have to use large-wheel wheelchairs, which limits some wheelchairs. Travel... Such details can only be truly understood by sitting in a wheelchair. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Acceleration is addictive. In order to let more &quot;wounded friends&quot; go out and to encourage themselves, for 3 months, 4 wheelchairs, and 15 hours a day, the &quot;wounded friends&quot; of the small shop walked out of Xi&#39;an. A barrier-free map of 597 square kilometers, with 3 colors and thousands of markers, covering all the main roads in Xi&#39;an&#39;s third ring road. The &quot;injured friends&quot; are called the &quot;little princes of wheelchair racing&quot;. They often meet in the suburbs of Xi&#39;an to compete in wheelchairs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Going out is a dilemma and a temptation. The farthest place Tian Ye has ever been was Sanya, which was five or six years ago. Facing the sea, with the sun on his head and the beach at his feet, drinking ice-cold watermelon juice and wearing sunglasses, he seemed to be in a new world. It was the Spring Festival, and it was the middle of winter in my hometown of Xi&#39;an, thousands of miles away. The wind was blowing and the snow was shining. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He is not good at expressing himself. How can he describe the sound of the waves? Speaking of that kind of remoteness, Tianye&#39;s gaze lengthened and became farther and farther, passing through the wall in front of him. A faint smile appeared on his face, and he seemed to hear it again, that &quot;like the spring in Xi&#39;an&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Waiting for someone to help you appear&quot; is the good luck you may need when going out. Just a few days before our interview, it rained heavily in Xi&#39;an. There was something going on in the store that had to be checked. Tian Ye drove his electric wheelchair out and accidentally fell into a puddle on the side of the road. He didn&#39;t notice it because the rain was so heavy that the puddle was covered. The mother saw that he hadn&#39;t left for a long time, so she came back to look for him along the road, only to find her son kneeling on the ground, half of his body soaked in water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There were not many pedestrians on the rainy day. A woman wanted to help, but she was not strong enough. Later, a man came and several people worked together to rescue Tianye. The wait took half an hour. &quot;There were also people who passed by but didn&#39;t help,&quot; Tian Ye added lightly at the end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you go out, you will hear voices of opposition, &quot;Disabled people can&#39;t do anything, just stay at home. Why go out? It will only cause chaos to society.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tianye is not satisfied with this. He felt angry when he said, &quot;A normal society should be an inclusive society. It should not only tolerate people, but also small animals, flowers and plants on the road.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the contact, Wang Ye felt the affection of Tian Ye Optimism has a sad undertone. &quot;He is not heartless or painless. He will have many moments of contemplation. The difficulties he encounters are all business-related. Physically, he is used to it.&quot; In Wang Ye&#39;s eyes, Tian Ye is a store owner who operates with heart. &quot;I would rather introduce him as a hard-working person and a store owner, rather than introducing him as a person with a disability first.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;10 years Before, I had the idea of ​​writing a book. Sitting in a wheelchair, Tian Ye talked about the past intermittently. He wanted to write about his life. The window was behind him, and the rain was pattering outside, making the room a little cool. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I have not thought about the beginning and the end,” Tian Ye answered my question about the book “A Lifetime”. “Maybe life is meaningless, but it does not mean that it should be spent casually. I know my own No matter what the script looks like, I will still act it out.&quot; In this book, he wanted to tell it step by step and use time to present it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[黄仕忠：怀念郭在贻老师]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259816]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-04 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/02/VtJosBtrjhfwd8TDOJidGESphrBDcbzN0ZrDVbVt.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;464&quot; height=&quot;704&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/02/VtJosBtrjhfwd8TDOJidGESphrBDcbzN0ZrDV bVt. png&quot; data-key=&quot;256610&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guo Zaiyi (1939-1989). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of Guo Xianyu)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teacher Guo Zaiyi is fundamentally a very proud person. More than thirty years after his death, I read a long letter he wrote to his brother Guo Lianyi on November 21, 1977. He talked freely about calligraphy schools and famous calligraphers at that time, and criticized Fang Qiu. in this way. The depth of calligraphy attainments seen in the handwriting astonished me. Because he knew what he said, it flowed out naturally from his mind. To him, it was just a normal conversation with his brother. Since it was a private letter, there was no need to be restrained, so he spoke frankly and heartily, rather than pretending to make shocking remarks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/02/FfXSAW9J2JSE9FokIQ036gM9yZDexKcABY9Nb7wV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height= &quot;847&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/02/FfXSAW9J2JSE9FokIQ036gM9yZDexKcABY9Nb7wV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256609&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guo Zaiyi wrote to his brother Guo Lianyi. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1988, Teacher Guo worked with students to complete the first draft of &quot;Review of the Dunhuang Bian Anthology&quot;. A friend wrote in a letter: &quot;This manuscript is devoted to our own opinions. We are confident and not without inventions. There are many unique secrets in the research and interpretation of common words and proverbs.&quot; It is also full of confidence rather than boasting. This tone can be seen or heard in his letters and conversations with friends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teacher Guo and I only exchanged words occasionally. He is not tall and his eyes are not big, but they are bright and bright. When he glances past with slightly squinted eyes, he seems to be condescending, which makes me feel uncomfortable. Health shrinks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, he had just passed his forties, and his body seemed to be condensed with infinite energy, shining so brightly that it was impossible to look directly at it. Especially in the field of Chinese history, he is the person who carries the banner after Jiang Liangfu and Jiang Lihong. In July 1986, with the approval of the Discipline Review Group of the State Council, the Chinese Department of Hangzhou University welcomed a new group of doctoral supervisors after Mr. Jiang Liangfu. They are: Shen Wenzhuo, Jiang Lihong, Xu Shuofang, and Guo Zaiyi. The first three are all over 60 years old, and Mr. Guo is only 47 years old. He was the youngest doctoral supervisor in the field of humanities and social sciences at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was an undergraduate (1978-1982), he offered elective courses for the 1978 and 1979 students. I didn’t choose them at the time, but I have looked up to him for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, several students in Grade 77, influenced by Teacher Guo’s ancient Chinese class, spontaneously formed an interest group to carry out research on word exegesis. One of them is named Bian Xincan, who is from my hometown, and we are the same age, so we have a lot of exchanges. He said: &quot;Teacher Guo is knowledgeable and humorous in class. One of the sentences touched me very much: &#39;Discovering a new meaning is like discovering a planet.&#39; It can be said to illuminate my soul.&quot; So he dived into ancient books. In the pile, I made cards and copied words. By the fourth grade (1981), I published papers in &quot;Hangzhou University Journal&quot; and &quot;Chinese Language&quot;. He was only 21 years old that year. His graduation thesis was also supervised by Teacher Guo. I have read his paper published in &quot;Hangzhou University Newspaper&quot;. The words he explained are well-documented and convincing. They are exactly the same as Mr. Jiang Lihong&#39;s &quot;Explanation of the Meanings of Dunhuang Bianwenwen&quot;. He said that after the article was written, he cautiously submitted it to Mr. Jiang Lihong, and received enthusiastic guidance and recommendation to &quot;Hangzhou University Newspaper&quot;; the article in &quot;Chinese Language&quot; was accepted by his own submission. At that time, many teachers were struggling to write papers and therefore could not be promoted, so this incident left a deep impression on me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Yimin, Zhang Yongquan, and Ji Weiqiang in the interest group also published papers in influential professional journals when they were in college or early after graduation. Yimin said that he was slightly excited when he saw his name listed with Mr. Ni Baoyuan, a teacher from Hangzhou University, in the catalog of &quot;Chinese Language&quot;. Yongquan re-entered Hangzhou University two years after graduation and studied for graduate school with Professor Guo, opening up a new world in the field of Dunhuang colloquial word research. Behind this, you can see the figure of Teacher Guo Zaiyi. They were just undergraduates, but under Teacher Guo&#39;s guidance, they achieved such outstanding results. As a student at the time, I admired him very much and could not imagine how great he was. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was in the autumn of 1982 that I was admitted to the graduate school of ancient literature at our university after graduating from my undergraduate degree. Teachers Guo Zaiyi, Zhu Hongxi and others recruited six graduate students in ancient Chinese, including Fang Yixin, Chen Baiye, Jin Xiaochun, Guo Xiaowu, Wang Yunlu and Ye Qing. The boys&#39; dormitory is next to each other. Yixin, Baiye and I are undergraduate classmates, so I often visit them and listen to their discussions. Teacher Guo asked me to read through the paragraph notes of &quot;Shuowen&quot; first with punctuation. At that time, there was a photocopy of the notes, with a purple cover and a large format. Each of them had it open on the table. It was very solemn and quite showing off, because &quot;our Teacher Guo&quot; believed that this was the right way to get started, and Teacher Guo himself ordered it. Read it three or four times. This made me very envious, and I bought a copy. However, I hesitated repeatedly on whether to read it through, and finally gave up, because at that time I was working on &quot;Historical Records&quot; and &quot;Han Dynasty&quot; under the guidance of Master Xu Shuo. There is not enough time for comparison of books. In the second academic year, I returned to opera from &quot;History&quot; and &quot;Han&quot; and systematically read through the basic literature on Yuan and Ming opera. In fact, I was indirectly influenced by Teacher Guo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teacher Guo gave his graduate students a course on &quot;Exegesis of Chu Ci&quot;, and I also took the course. This was the first time I walked into his class. It was an eye-opener and I was hooked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/02/nOgen87qOxr0PuPE2YstF401S5uyak71yRpmVexM.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/02/nOgen87qOxr0PuPE2YstF401S5uyak71yRpmVexM.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256607&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;When Teacher Guo was young, he was full of sunshine. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of Guo Xianyu)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teacher Guo is from Zouping, Shandong, and has a strong accent. For me, a Zhejiang native, it sounds a bit strange. The pronunciation of the characters is quite difficult to distinguish. Even so, his lectures were engaging. He first put forward examples and listed different theories, and then laid out his evidence, one, two, three, four, as if he were doing vertical arithmetic problems for primary school students, with clear layers and a clear view. In fact, it is extremely difficult to select examples for exegesis. Unless you are very familiar with the semantics of words and their origins, you will not be able to find accurate examples. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unfortunately, I only thought that it was enough to understand some &quot;methods&quot; of exegesis. I only had a superficial taste of Mr. Guo&#39;s thesis, and my understanding was not deep enough. Teacher Guo is based on his own years of research and combines the results of his predecessors to provide supplementary extensions and demonstrations in class. The core content has been published. One article is &quot;Exegesis of Chu Ci&quot;, published in &quot;Literary History&quot; (6th and 14th series, 1979, 1982); the other is &quot;Explanation of Vernacular Poems of the Tang Dynasty&quot;, published in &quot; Chinese Language, Issue 6, 1983. In 1984, with these two papers, he won the second prize of the first Young Linguist Award of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (a total of three people won the award, the other two being Li Jiahao and Jiang Shaoyu from the Chinese Department of Peking University). This award was established after the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; by Mr. Lu Shuxiang with a donation to commend young scholars (limited to those under 45 years old). There was no first prize in the &quot;first edition&quot;, so this is the highest award. Two years later, he was approved as a doctoral supervisor. It is said that Mr. Xu Fu greatly appreciated his research and strongly recommended him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have mostly forgotten many of Mr. Guo’s incisive explanations, but some of the “methods” he taught played a real role in my subsequent academic research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, Teacher Guo introduced the concept of continuous words, which are mostly double-sounding rhymes that must emphasize their sounds. There are different writing methods with similar sounds, and they cannot be broken into single characters for explanation. He also said that some of them were discovered by Mr. Jiang Liangfu. Mr. Jiang&#39;s famous work &quot;Collation and Annotation of Qu Yuan&#39;s Fu&quot; was completed when he was only 29 years old (originally written in 1929 and completed in 1931). I looked through the &quot;Chu Ci&quot; and found that dozens of words are continuous words. However, most of the annotated versions of contemporary scholars still use split words for explanation. In other words, just relying on &quot;continuous words&quot; as a trace gave the young Jiang Liangfu many new insights. His graduation thesis at Tsinghua University, &quot;An Examination of Shi Sao Lian Mian Zi&quot;, was supervised by Wang Guowei. Wang Guowei keenly listed the discussion of Qing Confucianism as a special topic. He only pointed out the problem in one article and gave the topic to the students. The students followed this and expanded it to open up their own fields. This allowed me to see the necessity of mastering &quot;academic principles&quot; and &quot;criteria&quot;, and at the same time I also learned the importance of &quot;family law&quot; and &quot;teacher-to-teacher inheritance&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teacher Guo gave a wonderful explanation in class on the difficult words in Chu Ci, as well as the words that scholars in the past considered &quot;unexplainable&quot;. From Wang Yi, Zhu Xi, Hong Xingzu, to Guo Moruo and other contemporary famous Chu Ci scholars, they all revealed certain weaknesses in the face of his exquisite &quot;exegesis&quot;. He stands on a high platform in this field and gives guidance to the country. In addition to explaining the exegesis, he also told us some tidbits, with a proud tone. He said that he would buy any new annotated version of the Songs of Chu that came out, look through it, and then throw it away because he didn&#39;t see anything new. At the same time, he would write to some annotators to express his congratulations, indicating that I have read your book, and also giving a hint: &quot;If you use Guo Moruo and Wen Huaisha, you will specify it; in my explanation, I will use Even if you don’t tell me, I actually know it!” After saying this, he tightened his lips, tilted his head slightly, and raised his chin, leaving a freeze in my mind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;——I then knew that for a scholar to be recognized, it requires a process of accumulation of qualifications. This gives me the peace of mind to face the same thing in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teacher Guo Zaiyi was one of the most dazzling young scholars at that time. This also makes us very curious, how does he stand out? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is said that he was a &quot;Xiaoyao sect&quot; during the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;. He brought books about &quot;Chu Ci&quot; from the reference room and read them one by one. His &quot;Exegesis of Chu Ci&quot; was written after reading hundreds of relevant materials. The obsession and fascination during this period can be evidenced by a story told by himself: Once when he went to buy meat, there was a long queue. He was holding a book and was fascinated. When he woke up, he found that it was dark and the market had already dispersed. , he was the only one, standing there reading for a long time. But at that time, &quot;the more knowledge, the more reactionary&quot;. Reading these things only had negative effects, so many people laughed at him. An old classmate of his, who may or may not be inferior to him in terms of talent, but far surpasses him in terms of &quot;shrewdness&quot;, actively participated in the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; and once dominated the world. After the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, he became one of the &quot;three types of people&quot; under inspection. When he returned to teaching, Guo Zaiyi had already shone in the academic world. Only then did he realize his past mistakes and start over. This led to a consensus that scholars should stay away from the “movement.” At the same time, there are also vague rumors that Teacher Guo is not in good health because he studies too hard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the summer of 1985, after I graduated as a graduate student, I stayed at the school to teach. I was assigned a faculty dormitory and shared a room with my classmate Jin Xiaochun. Xiaochun’s graduation thesis was supervised by Teacher Guo. In the following year, I heard many stories from him about &quot;our teacher Guo&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, I have a story related to Teacher Guo. In the autumn and winter of this year, Teacher He Chunhui and I went to Shanghai to deliver review materials for the promotion of teachers in our department, involving teachers such as Wu Xionghe, Cai Yijiang, Guo Zaiyi, and Ni Baoyuan. I am responsible for serving the experts in literature, and Chunhui is responsible for serving the experts in language and philology. She said that she was very enthusiastic when she met Mr. Shi Cunzhi from East China Normal University, and spoke highly of these teachers at Hangzhou University, especially Teacher Guo. I have participated in the promotion of several of my respected teachers to professional titles, and I feel quite &quot;honored&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiaochun got married before the Chinese New Year. His wife was from Hangzhou and her family was very well off. He moved to a new house and rarely came back. But when I come back, I always share the story of &quot;our Teacher Guo&quot; with me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the spring and summer of 1986, because of his professional title promotion, Teacher Guo improved his salary and purchased some new furniture. He was in a very happy mood, playing with his newly purchased items for Xiaochun. Xiaochun and the teacher are both teachers and friends, and sometimes they deliberately quarrel with the teacher. I remember that Teacher Guo was proud of his newly bought double sofa, so Xiaochun said jokingly: My sofa is a three-person sofa! Teacher Guo was speechless for a moment and said, &quot;Hey, I won&#39;t compare with you.&quot; He looked left and right, admiring it for himself, unable to contain his inner joy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Listening to Xiao Chundao telling such short stories, the common feeling in our hearts is one of indescribable bitterness. However, fortunately, all this will be a thing of the past, and the teacher’s vision has been filled with sunshine! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the fall of this year, I was admitted to Sun Yat-sen University to study for a Ph.D. Soon after, Xiaochun also went to the United States for academic exchange, and I rarely heard from Teacher Guo. More than two years later, in mid-January 1989, the news suddenly came that Teacher Guo Zaiyi had passed away. I was simply shocked! Is it fate? I have no words to say, I can only pray silently, may he be well in heaven. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many years later, I learned about Teacher Guo’s final condition from Zhang Yongquan’s article.

If the two are interacted and lost the &quot;courtesy&quot; about emotional value, and make the emotional value only become a supply of one party, then it must show that the power and status between the two people are not equal. Continuously provide emotional value, the so -called &quot;low low&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The relationship between the sexual relationship should generally be a peer relationship. It is a normal relationship to respect each other and please the other party. In this sense, men&#39;s needs for emotional value are often ignored, which is a problem that cannot be avoided. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A blogger said that men actually need emotional value very much. He mentioned a typical example: an Internet old man complained on Weibo, talking about his middle -aged crisis, his emotional collapse For a moment. Old Internet men usually appear as &quot;friend of women&quot;, so they have accumulated a certain amount of female fans. As a result, when he began to complain, he did not get the sympathy and comfort of his female fans, even if he always provided emotional value to his female fans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The blogger said with emotion: Some women seem to think that men must be very happy and should not complain and complain. And they are complaining all the time, even if many times they are very happy to outsiders, but they can always find some complaints. These women seem to have a collective consciousness. &quot;Do not make men feel happiness, and must not make men get emotional value. As for why, I can&#39;t understand it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This is the words of my heart. Of course, a couple can always raise a lot of examples of respecting each other or pleasing each other. However, according to my observation, men are always more likely to be frustrated in the process of getting emotional value from women. What Fang Hongjian met in his wife in &quot;Siege City&quot; was this sense of frustration. When not married, the relationship between the two was okay. Sun Roujia gave him a special psychological satisfaction in the adversity. But after the marriage, Sun Roujia seemed to change a person, making readers feel a little incredible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Blogers believe that men are not all for sex with women. If a woman hangs the emotional value every day to play the limit, all men who have a little self -esteem will eventually leave -for example, Fang Hongjian has intended. Of course, the way to leave is different. Many men find that &quot;the emotional value that women can&#39;t give, brothers can give, games can be given, and even fishing can be given.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This is a &quot;straight man&quot;, which not only explains the reasons why there are many &quot;fishing guys&quot; gathering in front of the river in front of my house, but also explain some middle -aged men. The principle of always playing games before getting home or staying downstairs for a while before entering the door: They know that there are endless complaints and endless mental loss in the house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This is the case, as the blogger said: In the past many years, men&#39;s demand for emotional value has been suppressed. So many women think that men only need to pay. The reason why this deformity is barely maintained is because a kind of ideological steel seal called &quot;responsibility&quot; is bound to men -whether it is to society or family. Traditional thoughts and values ​​tell men that you must settle this baby. And should endure any value, including happiness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This must have hit the hearts of many men who can&#39;t feel happy in marriage. Many ladies say that they have to find a &quot;emotional stability&quot; when they get married. Why? The main reason for such a choice is not just to eliminate those men who are emotionally unstable, but also in a deeper and more practical scene to make &quot;emotional stable&quot; men work hard for their families and endure tolerance as the highest pursuit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The question is, who is born as a person, who should be more emotional than who? This is a pseudo -proposition. Whether emotional stability is always relative, no life is a &quot;emotional stability&quot;, there is no time to be unstable -if such a person exists, it must be made of plastic and steel. It is worth noting that when this requirement becomes of course, it will inevitably lead to an unfair situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; What is the marriage for marriage? I am afraid that everyone has their own ideas, but in general, it is nothing more than these points: continue to write love, get stable sex, and raise offspring. Mentioning the responsibility after marriage, in most cases, men often become the main or even sources of income from the family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The discounts between Fu Shiger and Lao Liu fully show that emotional value is affected by family economic relations. Once a man brings children at home, it is often not optimistic. Because society is not the same for full -time wives and full -time husbands. If men want to maintain dignity, they are not discriminated and not suffered from being angry. After all, a man who flows into the world is more likely to be lightly seen by public opinion than a woman who only brings a baby at home, and even regarded as a &quot;waste of a soft rice&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It stands to reason that in the external mode of the male lead, men have a great hope of getting emotional value in the family. But it is interesting that theoretical connotation is often broken in reality. Some men are exhausted and died, and they have to be said to be said: if they know that playing games, they do not know how to do housework. Sometimes it is also labeled with the &quot;Paramilia Parenting&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The so -called emotional value is &quot;persuasion&quot; in the final analysis, women are sad, men are coax, and in turn should be the same. If a man is always forcibly given &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;hard&quot;, it is created as a role that is insulating with emotional value, and paid blindly in a wider range; It wo n’t be able to come over. Even men can only solve them by themselves, so this relationship has changed, and it also loses the emotional foundation of suffering from the chief and common. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Is there no emotional needs for men, or shouldn&#39;t they seek emotional help? Of course not. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Men and women should be equal on the issue of emotional value. It is a normal way to get along with emotional values ​​like men and women, and to give respect and care. Based on this, it is the way to balance each other and solve each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A family must not be a quagmire that has absolute power and the other party can only be checked. No one will be willing to marry or marry a &quot;slave master&quot; for confession. Therefore, no matter whether men and women want their rights and spirit to be respected by the other side, they refuse to kneel and lick and endless unilateral efforts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The current marriage rate has plummeted, the divorce rate rises, and the increasing number of unmarried families will explain to a certain extent that the connotation of &quot;home&quot; is more rational and stricter to a certain extent, so as to take the initiative Escape from an invisible shackle. This cold fact tells us that marriage and family are the &quot;intangible&quot; subjects that two people operate with love and sincerity. For a long time for marriage and family, if you want everyone to have more confidence in marriage and family, you must look at the emotional needs of both parties fairly and create a kind of love relationship, especially abandoning the prejudice of &quot;men without emotional value&quot;. , So that we can maintain each other&#39;s consciousness to the greatest extent, and warm each other can be stable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>; • &lt;/span>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>; (&quot;>; ( This article is only the personal point of view of the author, does not represent the position of this newspaper) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>; &lt;br>; &lt;hr>; &lt;div>; Get more RSS: &lt;br>; &lt;a href = &quot;&quot; https://feedx.net &quot;style =&quot; color: orange &quot;target =&quot; _blank &quot;>; https://feedx.net &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href =&quot; https://feedx.best &quot;style = &quot;COLOR: Orange&quot; target = &quot;_blank&quot;>; https://feedx.best &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[戛纳金棕榈获奖影片，一场对亲密关系的审判]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259887]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-03 21:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/03/OCO1C2XV8ZTBS2C46CQ4necozc4eqxitma884bp.jpg &quot;border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 960 &quot;height =&quot; 519 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm/medias/i Mage/23/11/03/OCO1C2XV8ZTBS2C46CQ4necozc4eqxitma884bpf. jpg &quot;data-key =&quot; 256876 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999; text-align: center; &quot;>; After the husband fell to the building, the court started a trial of murder or suicide. At the same time, the analysis of family relations was also revealed. &lt;span style = &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (data map/picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the cabin under the Alps in France, an interview is ongoing. Female writers look good at avoiding problems, and once anti -customers became questioners. The young reporter sitting opposite her seemed a little unable to fight, so she had to chat along with her wishes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Suddenly, the sound of music played by the writer&#39;s husband came upstairs, and his dissatisfaction was obvious. The interview was forced to terminate, and the female reporter left. Shortly after she left, the writer&#39;s husband was found to be killed from the snow outside the cabin by their son. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The question is, who is the murderer? If the previous suspense narrative strategy, the plot must be reversed by multiple reversals, the truth will come out of the water. In 2023, the film &quot;Analysis of the Death of Falling Death&quot;, which was only awarded the Cannes Film Festival Golden Palm Award in 2023, provided another solution. Director of the director, Rostein Trier, did not seem to care whether the plot was reversed, and even the murderer was anyone else. unimportant. Dripping the suspenseful coat, Terier is even more interested in how people use their respective descriptions to complete the analysis of a death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The film cleverly set up the trial session, so the intimacy of the private field should be spread out naked to present in front of everyone. One party wants to prove the murder, and the other party wants to prove her husband&#39;s suicide to show his innocence. Both sides are trying to use their own narrative to approach the truth. All clues may become a confession. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; As a novelist, Sandler&#39;s writing has become the object of the prosecution&#39;s review. &quot;Her life is in the book, especially her relationship.&quot; In the novel, the wife&#39;s disgust of her husband, the possibility of the husband&#39;s death in the mind, and the imagination of how to kill, these fictional contents are understood as a mapping of the motivation to real killing. Under this review, the narratives in the book are no longer complete. They are cut into fragments, and even sentences, and then connect with reality with the will of people to reconstruct the narrative. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; One of the key evidence in the film is the recording of the husband Samuel before death. Samuel was a teacher before and also liked to write. Because Samuel has some responsibility for his son Daniel&#39;s permanent vision damage. Out of guilt, he spends a lot of time in various family affairs and his companionship for Daniel. He seemed to have no regrets and willingness, but the recording showed the other side of the family&#39;s intimate relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the recording, Samuel asked his wife to re -consider the family division of labor and believe that he had sacrificed too many people in the family affairs. He wanted more time to write. After listening, Sandler mocked him indifferently that the writer would not stop writing because he had children and housework. No one forced him, and he did not owe him. The director seems to be intended to adjust the gender. Samuel has experienced many women&#39;s situations in reality in reality, but they are helpless and struggling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Next, the dispute between the two in the recording is becoming more intense. Sandrey&#39;s bisexual identity, derailment and other private information were unveiled in Samuel&#39;s mouth and fell into the ears of everyone in the trial. From the perspective of the prosecution, these are the motivations and reasons of the unbalanced relationship between husband and wife and murdering their husbands. Here, it was originally a recording of a dimension in the relationship between the relationship between people, and it was also used to refer to the full picture to help the prosecution complete the deduction and reconstruction of the truth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Sandler attempts to deny this kind of narrative that has always been reconciled. She said to Samuel&#39;s psychologist as one of the witnesses, &quot;You are just a small part of the whole situation, a pair of pairs Husbands and wives are like a mess ... &quot;She believes that this cannot prove that herself is a murderer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In contradiction, Sandler himself also described the truth intentionally or unintentionally. , All became the reason for her reconstruction of his suicide during the defense process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Even if the evidence fragments presented by both parties are real, maybe no one dares to confirm the suicide or his killing story itself based on these fragments. As the director Rostein Trier said, &quot;This is very modern, this is our life today. In trials, various things will change and give additional weights to generate new fiction. &quot;&amp; Nbsp; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; evidence is not only presented in front of the prosecution, but also expands Xu Xu in front of his son Daniel. He also started to examine his parents again. At the beginning, he was convinced of his mother, and with the narrative of the two sides in the trial, his attitude gradually became swinging. In his mind, his mother even hit his father and pushed him downstairs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the other side, he also tried to feed the dog to verify the fact that his mother had taken medicine and vomiting. He also remembered his father talked to him when sending a dog to see a doctor. He thought that This shows his father&#39;s suicide tendency. From all kinds of swaying to the selection of facts of facts, Daniel finally built his own narrative version of the truth in his mind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/hsp4i05lqvgiert0uszvagtwr6wapo1ubgq.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot;960&quot; height = &quot;540&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/hsp4i05lqvgiert0usza4b1zvagtwr6wapo1ubgq.jpg =&quot; 256875 &quot;>; &lt;/p. >; &lt;p style = &quot;coloror : #999; text-align: center; &quot;>;&quot; Analysis of the Death of Falling &quot;(also translated&quot; Falling Trial &quot;) stills. &lt;span style = &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (data map/picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Director Rostein Trier mentioned in an interview that &quot;these trials come to people to come It is a nightmare, because your own life has been deprived. Everyone is creating a fictional story and has not really tried to achieve the truth. I am very fascinated by the truth and try to seek the truth through the story. I think this is very interesting. . &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Obviously, the director also wants to pull the audience into the construction of the truth about the truth. Under the suspenseful shell, as the audience, we have been thinking about who the murderer is since the fall of Samuel. In the confrontation between the two parties, whenever they list new evidence and make new statements and debate, we will involuntarily invest in Samuel and Sandler, just like Daniel, trying to provide what they provide from the two parties. The factual evidence and their narrative find their own narratives and deduce the truth of death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But we are more passive outside the film. All narratives are always constructed on the interpretation of the truth about the truth in the film, which also means that our perception of the truth is more uncertain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The film eventually ended with innocence. Since both sides have fictional factors, why can one describe be defeated by another? Perhaps because of the emotional power -Daniel&#39;s done told by Daniel told his father, he moved the judge, and successfully helped his mother to win. After Sandler returned home, Daniel hugged and kissed her. In the silence of a room, a rare tenderness lingered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Is this the truth? Not really. In the previous narratives of all parties, the director had successfully buried the skeptic seeds between the audience. Even if Sandler was convicted, people&#39;s hesitant and uncertainty did not disappear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The heroine&#39;s actor Sandra Hueller once asked the director on the script problem. Her role was guilty or innocent. Terier told her, &quot;I don’t know, but I hope You seem to be innocent. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;She may have a responsibility but has no guilt, or she may be guilty but has no responsibility. She can bear the responsibility of persecution of him, but did not kill him, or she could not kill him Kill him in the case -whether in an impulsive way or in the way we can try. The truth exists, but it is too complicated and cannot be grasped here. &quot;Director Rastein Terier is I said in an interview. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But looking back, how the truth may not be important. Fiction is a human talent. As long as you are happy, you can build your own narrative with a few keywords. However, if the relationship between people is like this death, it is reviewed and reconstructed like this death, and there is actually no relationship that can withstand such rigorous and fine analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[亚太安全专家谈：中国发展红利被周边国家共享]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259863]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-03 20:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; After the Cold War is over, although there are some geopolitical tension or hot issues in the region, the Asia-Pacific region still maintains peace in peace.

How to continue to maintain prosperous and stable Asia Pacific? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On October 29, 2023, at the Beijing Xiangshan Forum &quot;Dialogue of Chinese and Famous Masters&quot;, a number of Chinese and foreign scholars conducted in -depth discussions on issues such as &quot;China&#39;s role in maintaining the safety of Asia -Pacific&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Fu Ying, former deputy minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People&#39;s Republic of China and the founder of the Tsinghua Research Institute of International Security Strategy, said at the meeting that after the Cold War, the Asia -Pacific region seized opportunities, quickly opened to the outside world, and quickly entered regional integration. In the past few decades, the Asia -Pacific region has no major war and political conflicts, and there is no major social turmoil. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;There are more than 40 years of peaceful development in the Asia -Pacific region. In this process, China has played a core role. The rapid development of China&#39;s region has been shared by neighboring countries.

At the time of turning, many countries are still walking on the verge of development and poverty. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Fu Ying said in his speech that in the past long period of time, the Asia -Pacific region has achieved extremely fast economic development, surpassing beyond Many countries and regions in the market. She listed the data of Bank of Asia that in the past 42 years, Asian GDP has increased 7 times. And this phenomenon is also called &quot;the Economic Development Miracle in the Asia -Pacific region&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Fu Ying believes that peaceful and stable, regional focus on cooperative dialogue and economic globalization are important reasons for the development of the Asia -Pacific economic development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; What are the unique driving forces behind the stability and security of the Asia -Pacific region for decades? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;In order to maintain the long -term stability and security of Asia -Pacific, we need to discover a unique&quot; Asia -Pacific model &quot;.&quot; Chen Dongxiao, Dean of the Shanghai International Institute of International Issues, said that &quot;open regionalism&quot; is an important driving factor And this concept contains many contents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;First of all, economic development cooperation is the focus. It transcends ideology and government differences. Secondly, under regional openness, regardless Following social rules in an equal way. We should not have dual standards, which is very important. &quot;Chen Dongxiao said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In contrast to the peaceful and stability of the Asia -Pacific region, in recent years, Europe and the Middle East have continued to ignite war. In the forum discussion, two European and American scholars also expressed their thinking about &quot;Chinese and Western differences&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Why is there a difference between the Asia -Pacific region and Europe? There are many reasons behind it.&quot; Michael Shiwen, chief director of the East Asia Project of the Institute of Institute of the Institute of Qinxi National Affairs, believes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The Dean of the School of World Economics and International Affairs of the Russian University of Higher Economics, the dean of the School of Economics and International Affairs, agreed with Shi Wen, saying that &quot;it is still in the early stages, we still have to be cautious&quot; &quot; . At the same time, he also emphasized &quot;cultural factors&quot; different from Asia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;There are many wars in European history. Peace or war in Europe is always closely related to European problems,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; The risk of the US leadership is growing. &lt;/H4>; &lt;p>; For the role of the United States in the security of Asia Pacific, Huang Zaihao, director of the International Research Center of the University of Foreign Languages, proposed that &quot;Although there is no perfect leader in the world (there is no perfect leader in the world (there is no perfect leader in the world ( ), But the risk of US leaders is getting greater and greater. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He used the US policy to China&#39;s policy, and said that from the Trump administration to the current Biden government, the United States has changed many times in global strategy and economic details. &quot;The United States does not see the overall situation clearly, and its strategy and tactics are not clear. Therefore, the lack of consistency vision and policy in the United States has caused the current international order unstable.&quot; He said. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; At the meeting, Michael Shiwen, chief director of the East Asian Project of the Institute of Qinxi National Affairs Institute in the United States, mentioned the views of &quot;what is the ultimate security role of China in Asia is still uncertain&quot; in his speech. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Fu Ying directly refuted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;I don&#39;t agree with this type of point of view. Mr. Michael Shiwen&#39;s logic is very puzzled.&quot; Fu Ying said that China has actively promoted the economic development of the Asia -Pacific region, and the United States has benefited a lot from it. . This &quot;lack of persuasive&quot; logic is probably derived from the theory of power change for hundreds of years in the international community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;But you know that China&#39;s development background is completely different.&quot; She said that there is a big difference between China and the United States. But it does not affect the pace of Sino -US pursuit of their respective development and support each other. If the power of China has become a &quot;threat&quot; in the Asia -Pacific region, how do you look at the rise of emerging countries such as India and Indonesia in the future? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Fu Ying also pointed out that the United States is currently anxious about its own global influence, but this is not a problem that China arises, but because of the result of &quot;economic globalization and the United States&#39; own mistakes&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The problem of the United States has made it difficult. Look at what benefits the United States has gained in the trade war? The trade war has caused the US -China trade deficit to increase, but does it reduce China&#39;s export to the United States? In fact, there is no, on the contrary, the data is still increasing. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; She proposed that the United States should be an active contribution of the development of the region, rather than trying to use competition to prioritize the agenda of the region. Successful cooperation, dialogue and economic development in the Asia -Pacific region. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Finding balance, crisis control &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In his speech, a number of scholars said in unison that the old balance in international order may be broken and new changes are about to occur. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Sheri Garakanov said that as the United States and Western society began to impact and change globalization, the so -called era of globalization has ended. He said that we must have a new theory or a new global governance model, and this model must be determined by all partners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;In the past so many years, we have been saying that we want to achieve a win -win situation, we must benefit all relevant parties. But unfortunately, we don’t live in the ideal world. Different countries have reached a balance, &quot;Sidega Karaganov said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Michael Shiwen said that any international system must balance the needs of different countries and cooperate under balance. (Between the country) We must seek common interests and the demands of the same economic development, and whether there are the same historical problems to be solved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He insisted that the current uncertainty still exists between the country and cannot be regulated. Countries will be affected by power change, and there will be no doubt that there will be uncertainty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;It cannot be said that China thinks that countries are Datong, we can do this. It cannot solve many basic problems. Moreover, this is not caused by the United States It can also trigger changes in international order. &quot;Shi Wen said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; So how to maintain the safety and peace of the Asia -Pacific region before the formation of the new international order? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Chen Dongxiao proposed the principle of &quot;three nos&quot; -that is, regardless of the group camp, no military war, especially the nuclear war, and not using dual standards. &quot;In the past few years, the Chinese government has repeatedly reiterated on many occasions that war is not a good way to deal with different countries, but it has brought more crises.&quot; He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Chen Dongxiao believes that Sino -US relations are an important factor in regional security. At the same time, the role of small countries in the Asia -Pacific region cannot be ignored, and which faction should not be divided into. &quot;Some neutral countries can play an important role, such as ASEAN countries that can respond to differences in the Asia -Pacific region and achieve related cooperation,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Huang Zaihao proposed that compared with other areas, the Asia -Pacific region is relatively stable, and it can maintain relatively balanced between China and the United States. At present, there are external voices that China and the United States have entered the &quot;New Cold War&quot;, but he thinks it is more like a &quot;compound competition&quot;. Moreover, the two major powers have begun to carry out crisis management and have set up communication channels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;But now there is no war, only fighting, so it can be controlled.&quot; Huang Zaihao said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>; &lt;br>; &lt;hr>; &lt;div>; Get more RSS: &lt;br>; &lt;a href = &quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style = &quot;color: orange&quot; target = &quot;_blank&quot;>; https://feedx.net &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;cone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>; https: // feedx.

Different from Dounan&#39;s main fresh cut flowers, most of the Yinlian Penpertflower markets built in 2012 are green plants and potted plants. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the past 10 years, there were all kinds of seedlings and succulents in the greenhouse, and now some vegetables have been planted. This is related to natural resource inspectors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the afternoon of September 15, 2023, on Furu Street, Beijing, the Ministry of Natural Resources reported the main issues of illegal and violations found in the regular inspector in 2023. Among them, the issue of &quot;large shed houses&quot; in Yinlian Pen Flower Market was named. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In addition to reporting typical issues, the Ministry of Natural Resources also had a interview at the same time: commissioned by the National Natural Resources Supervisor, Chen Chenzhao, Vice Governor of the National Natural Resources of Natural Resources, discovered illegal and violations of the inspection in 2023. The problem highlights the main person in charge of 9 cities (states) governments to interview in a face -to -face interview. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 9 cities (states) are Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, Harbin City, Heilongjiang Province, Wenzhou City, Zhejiang Province, Luzhou City, Anhui Province, Linyi City, Shandong Province, Hechi City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and southwestern Guizhou Province, Guizhou Province State, Kunming City, Yunnan Province, Lanzhou City, Gansu Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In addition to the city (state) of these cities (states) governments participating in the interview, the provincial (autonomous region) government deputy secretary -general of these cities and prefectures, and the provincial and municipal natural resource departments &quot;Also asked to attend. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; The article published by the Office of the National Natural Resources Governor&#39;s Office shows that the interview is &quot;the prominent problems found in the face of the inspector, urge the local government Cultivation land protects the red line. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This is the first large -scale and high -standard concentration and public interviews held for the first time since the establishment of the Ministry of Natural Resources in 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &lt;span>; &lt;/span>; &lt;strong>; illegal occupation of cultivated land &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; 77 acres &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; First of all, the states are all kinds of shops printed with &quot;flowers&quot;, &quot;seedlings&quot; and &quot;gardening&quot;.
