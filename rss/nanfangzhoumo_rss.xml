In such a long process, the ups and downs, grievances and resentments between China and the United States are a very complicated record. Since China switched to welcoming the world, the entanglement between China and the United States is probably more complicated than the relationship between China and any other country in history, and has far-reaching consequences.</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 23:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[被渴慕的军训丨记者手记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259426]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/A72oqQdD8BybPWTNg0BalhXWNoO5Mh57DFsDOpHt.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;612&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/A72oqQdD8BybPWTNg0BalhXWNoO5Mh 57DFsDOpHt. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254443&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guangxi Guilin University of Electronic Science and Technology 2023 freshmen military training demonstration&lt;span style=&quot;color: # aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For relevant reports, please see &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https:/ /www.infzm.com/contents/258988&quot; title=&quot;How is hard-core military training accomplished&quot;>;How is hard-core military training accomplished&lt;/a>;》&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Interview with Guilin University of Electronic Science and Technology ( &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as &quot;Guidian&quot;&lt;/span>;) and Guilin Institute of Aerospace Industry (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as &quot;Guihang&quot;&lt;/span>;) as a person in charge of military training, I wanted to understand the difficulties of organizing hard-core military training, but I always failed to do so. The two schools borrowed simulated weapons and combat vehicles without much trouble. The tactical training seemed to come naturally. The local garrison area and military training and education base are willing to open their doors to the school and can deliver realistic equipment and a sufficient number of active or retired military personnel to the new students participating in the training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in addition to these objective factors, I feel that there is a strong spiritual power that allows the hard-core military training in these two universities in Guangxi to be implemented smoothly. In the minds of students participating in special warfare training, military training is not an obligation that is forced to be completed, but a life experience that is desired. One kind of person looks forward to the sense of relief when everything ends from the first day of military training; the other kind of person hopes to pursue the intrinsic value of military training and is eager to continue it even after the military training ends. I think that when I participated in military training as a student, I belonged to the former; but many training students in Guilin universities fell into the latter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Shen Hong was interviewed, he was a little shy. Huang Yilong, chairman of the Patriotic National Defense Education Association, often said that Shen Hong was an outstanding representative of the Red Army&#39;s demining gunners. Upon hearing such compliments, Shen Hong would either bury his head in the ground or look at the street lights in the distance, deliberately hiding his smile from me. Different from the occasional erratic expression, even if the person had already stepped out of the queue, for more than 20 minutes, Shen Hong&#39;s simulated gun was fixed on his chest in a standard gun-holding posture from beginning to end, without moving at all. Two weeks of freshmen military training and two weeks of daily association training seemed to have carved his rock-solid movements into a habit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to the hardships of special warfare training, Shen Hong always downplays: &quot;There are bruises on elbows, knees, legs, and feet, but they will be over with some medicine.&quot; &quot;While leaping forward, I suddenly heard something The body cannot react to the enemy&#39;s instructions on the left and right, so I keep practicing this movement and practice harder. I will do it wrong at first, but after practicing for three or four days, I can reach the standard.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with these, the &quot;soldier&quot; Identity has more appeal to Shen Hong. He was born in Huanjiang Maonan Autonomous County, Guangxi. He is a freshman this year and has been following war movies and spy dramas for more than ten years. Recalling the time he spent watching TV with his father, Shen Hong&#39;s tone raised a few notches, &quot;Chinese soldiers are very handsome.&quot; The first time he knew that his father, a farmer, had been a soldier was because he saw his marching kettle. &quot;That&#39;s a unique kettle in the army.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shen Hong is convinced that if he meets the recruitment standards, he will definitely join the army after graduation. For him, this military training is not only a required course according to the syllabus, but also a serious preparatory exercise before officially joining the army. What attracted him to join the tactical company was not only the rich firearms training, but also the &quot;soldier&#39;s pride&quot; that comes with pressure. In Shen Hong&#39;s eyes, his teammates are also &quot;people with a strong sense of family and country, who speak directly and boldly.&quot; &quot;I like to be friends with people who can tell their true feelings.&quot; He also longs for the future life in the military camp: if he is bitten by ants during training on the grass, a comrade will happily hand him a dose of ointment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 28, it was already dark when the Guihang military training performance ended. The special operations team members who had no chance to ride in the armored vehicle during the performance climbed into the armored vehicle one by one in groups of eight or nine. They sat in a small circle on the roof of the car, arms around each other, singing songs as the chariot moved forward. Everyone&#39;s face was covered with tired camouflage makeup, but the singing was still loud. They were like battle-hardened soldiers returning in triumph. Marching to the center of the playground, the armored vehicle suddenly stopped, and the team members staggered, as if they were waking up from a dream. But when they climbed down from the car, they saw other team members sitting cross-legged under the street lamp in the distance, noisy and lively, so they ran over. The WeChat messages, photos, and words of their comrades remained forever in the camouflage-colored dream. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 23:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“最后一代务农人”：他们正在消失的技艺、生活方式与价值观]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259340]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On the afternoon of the fourth day after returning home during the National Day holiday, my mother and I went for a walk. We met Grandma Yang in a vegetable field near the river. She was planting radish seedlings with her hunched back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My mother told me that Grandma Yang is 81 years old and is the oldest person in the village. Grandma Yang’s wife has passed away many years ago. Her two sons are developing in Wuhan, the provincial capital, and she lives alone. I saw that there were daikon, carrots, beetroot, and cabbage planted in the field, so I asked Grandma Yang why she planted so many. She said, &quot;Four months later, the children all went home, and together they had 9 mouths.&quot; Zi realized that the Spring Festival would be in four months. She also added, &quot;Not only do they come back to eat during the Chinese New Year, I also have to prepare some for them to take with them when they leave.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Seeing that the radishes I planted earlier were not growing very well, I asked Why, she told two reasons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Firstly, many farmers have gone to cities to work, many fields are deserted, bushes are everywhere, and there are many more wild boars, badgers and other animals than before. Just like the numbers of people, they have Instead of sneakily eating crops including vegetables at night, they can also freely invade vegetable fields, valleys, and sweet potato fields during the day. During the day, the old man can come to the vegetable fields with a stick from time to time to guard them and drive away wild animals. , at night, she had absolutely no choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, due to the long-term use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers, the soil structure of farmland has changed. The soil has become seriously compacted, fertility has dropped sharply, and the output of various crops, including vegetables, has dropped sharply. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;In fact, we can’t go back&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After telling Grandma Yang to be careful, my mother and I continued walking. There was a large field of rice fields in front of me. My mother asked me which one belonged to my family. I guessed twice, but my mother shook her head. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I suddenly felt ashamed. I didn’t even know where my own farm was. Probably since I started working in 2008, every time I go home, my parents rarely go to the fields to do farm work, but stay with me. Of course, I rarely have the opportunity to go to the fields. As time went by, I forgot the exact location of the fields at home. Seeing that the rice was golden yellow, I suggested harvesting it the next day and helped cut it. Unexpectedly, my mother was very worried about my rice cutting skills. &quot;It&#39;s better to wait until you return to Guangzhou. Your dad and I will take our time. If you haven&#39;t gone to the fields for many years, it will be bad if you cut your hands.&quot; I was speechless, because the fact is that although I go home often, I rarely work in the fields. I am no longer an important labor force in the family like when I was in elementary school and junior high school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I work at a university in Guangzhou. I have a long summer and winter vacation. I go home for many more days every year than other young people in the village. For example, my brother started his working career after dropping out of school in his second year of high school at the age of 17. He basically works outside all year round, except for about half a month when he goes home during the Spring Festival. My brother is 44 years old and has been working for 27 years. Now, he has bought a house in Wuhan, and his sister-in-law and two nephews also live in Wuhan permanently. The eldest nephew is studying in college, and the sister-in-law takes care of the younger nephew who is in elementary school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, my family of four is in Guangzhou, and my brother’s family of four is in Wuhan. We have all been actively or passively involved in the wave of urbanization, and it is difficult for us to return. The hometown is developed or settled. In fact, we can&#39;t go back because we are no longer an &quot;agricultural population&quot; and have been engaged in &quot;non-agricultural industries&quot;, which has nothing to do with my brother&#39;s household registration in his hometown. No matter whether we enjoy the various benefits or treatment of authentic Guangzhou or Wuhan citizens, we are already veritable (new) Guangzhou people or (new) Wuhan people. Guangzhou or Wuhan is our permanent residence, and it is the place where we and our children A place to eat, drink, have sex, and have basic necessities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My brother and I are born in the 1970s. What are the people born in the 80s and 90s who are younger than us in the village doing? Where now? A small number of people have left their hometowns by studying, but most of them, like my brother, work outside all year round. What they have in common is that they are away from home all year round, and they only come home for ten and a half days during the Chinese New Year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What are those born in the 1960s who are older than us doing? There are eight people born in the 1960s in my village. Four of them went to the city to work with their children, either taking care of their grandchildren who were in school or working for their sons who were construction workers. Two of them opened decoration companies, starting in Wuhan and Xining respectively. The last two are in the education industry. One is a teacher at a university in Wuhan, and the other is the principal of a village primary school in his hometown. It is not difficult to see that the eight people born in the 1960s have basically left the countryside and agriculture, and they all only go home during the Chinese New Year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The people born in the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s have all moved into the city and are currently working hard in the city. Do they have any plans or signs of returning to the village in the future? I feel minimal. They have been in the city for many years, and their food, culture, and habits have already been highly urbanized. The post-80s and post-90s generations have experienced the rinsing of urbanization. They can no longer live without these things in shopping malls, KTVs, cinemas, fast food, and game arcades. Even Uncle Xia, who was born in 1962, said, &quot;Although I have been farming in my hometown for more than 20 years, I am no longer used to going home because life in my hometown is too inconvenient and the city is too convenient.&quot; In Northeast China Brother Wen, who works part-time, also mentioned, &quot;The winter at home is too cold and I am not used to it. I have stayed in Harbin for 32 years. Although the outdoor temperature is low, the indoors are heated and very comfortable.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Farmers Vs Peasants&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It goes without saying that the only people who are still farming in their hometowns are those born in the 1940s like Grandma Yang, and those born in the 1950s like my parents. As children have gone to the city to go to school, many women have also joined the migrant workers, and the post-60s generation who went out to make a living in the early 1980s have adapted greatly to urban life. In the past, the &quot;386199&quot; army, which mainly constituted the rural population , now only the lonely &quot;99&quot; is left, and the corresponding specific groups are those born in the 40s and 50s. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I would like to express that this group of people is truly the &quot;last generation of farmers&quot;. In particular, the author does not use the concept of &quot;farmers&quot;. In my opinion, concepts such as &quot;farmers&quot; and &quot;workers&quot; have distinct political and identity attributes. In the context of the use of the word &quot;farmers&quot;, there are often several contrasting groups, such as &quot;which group does farmers correspond to?&quot; &quot;Farmers are in rural areas, and workers are In the city&quot;, this is not the case. In essence, they are just differences in industry or professional division of labor. There are no political or identity differences or oppositions. A similar situation exists with the word &quot;worker&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As times have changed, we are more willing to use concepts that are familiar and easier for ordinary people to accept, such as &quot;migrant workers&quot;, &quot;migrant workers&quot;, &quot;migrant girls&quot;, &quot;farmers&quot; and &quot;migrant workers&quot;. Whether they are &quot;farmers&quot; or &quot;laborers,&quot; they are all industrial workers/laborers in the true sense of the word. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The skills of farmers&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As &quot;farmers&quot;, this group of elderly people are naturally well versed in various techniques and techniques of farming or rural areas and agriculture. They have been familiar with agricultural seasons since they were young. , know when to spring plow, when to raise seedlings, when to sow seeds, when to fertilize, when to weed, when to harvest, and what to use to store crops. They know how to use ashes from stoves or firewood piles as fertilizer, and they also know how to use human, chicken, pig and other manure as an important supplement for crop nutrients, instead of just relying on pesticides or chemical fertilizers to improve soil fertility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They will use the corner land in front of and behind the house to grow some vegetables, or reclaim idle or abandoned land in the mountains that is full of rocks or has been deserted for a long time to grow things. Before building a house or choosing a cemetery, they would ask Feng Shui masters to take a look; they invented bamboo beds for cooling in the summer, drying cages for heating in the winter, and chamber pots for using the toilet at night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many of them have been standard rural craftsmen since they were young, such as blacksmiths, painters, oilers, carpenters, quilters, tailors, midwives, barefoot doctors, fortune tellers, and witch doctors. When the village was renovated, they reminded young people not to easily remove the ancient trees at the entrance of the village, and strongly recommended that the old ancestral hall in the center of the village be retained. When family members have stomachaches, diarrhea, or other three diseases and two pains, they will go to the fields to find Houttuynia cordata and mugwort leaves, and use them to soak their feet, bathe, smoke them, or boil them in water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is no exaggeration to say that there are countless skills that they are familiar with or master. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, the vast majority of them have a very low level of education, with a high proportion of illiterates or semi-illiterates, but this does not hinder their deep understanding and familiarity with agricultural technology, rural memories and agricultural civilization. They may have never spoken about circular economy, ecological agriculture, intensive and economical land use, intangible cultural heritage, etc. in textbooks or propaganda slogans, nor do they know how to express them, but they have been practicing them all their lives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This illustrates the truth that culture and civilization often or usually have little or not much to do with educational level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be honest, the &quot;last generation of farmers&quot; has made significant contributions to the inheritance of agricultural technology, the continuation of agricultural civilization, the harmony of families, and the country&#39;s urbanization and modernization. It is they who have succeeded their forefathers and ancestors, passing on from generation to generation, that agricultural civilization can be carried forward and passed on; it is they who guard their hometowns and rear areas so that their children and their younger generations can enter the city calmly and confidently Work hard to create a new life for the new generation; it is the kindness and hard work of them and their children that created the miracle of China&#39;s low-cost industrialization, urbanization and modernization. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The lifestyle and values ​​of farmers&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In terms of lifestyle, the &quot;last generation of farmers&quot; generally have a thrifty character, such as eating as little as possible and eating as much as possible. How many people eat leftovers for pigs, dogs, chickens and other livestock and poultry? Although they are very pleased with the various express delivery out of filial piety and respect for their children, they occasionally complain. They feel that their children spend money like water and spend money lavishly. . The acquisition and cultivation of thrifty character is certainly related to the most difficult and difficult years they experienced, but in that era of extreme material poverty, without frugality and frugality, there was no way to achieve the accumulation of material and wealth, as well as capital accumulation. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;capital accumulation&quot; here can be understood as &quot;without money, unable to pay tuition, even if the children are admitted to college, they will not be able to go to college. As a rural person, the biggest ambition is to &#39;jump out of the farm gate&#39; , as well as the future glory of the family and the glory of the ancestors, naturally they cannot be fulfilled.&quot; The assumption of the above statement is that children are the most important investment area of ​​the family, the expenditure on raising children is the investment cost, and the future development and returns of the children are investment income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of values, the &quot;last generation of farmers&quot; are very &quot;selfless&quot; and &quot;selfless&quot; to the extreme. The whole meaning of their lives lies in contribution and dedication. Many of them spend most of their lives or their entire lives living for others and their families. They have gone through untold hardships and have been stuck to the land all their lives. They have never or rarely left their hometowns and have been doing farm work all their lives. The so-called &quot;face to the loess and back to the sky&quot; accurately refers to their generation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many of them have been the main labor force in their families since they were young. They work hard and save all their lives, build houses, marry and have children, and then live frugally to raise their children and provide them with education. When the children grow up, they still think about Give your children a subsidy to share the pressure of buying a house in the city or getting married and starting a family. A few people even endured the torture of acculturation and still chose to go to the city to cook for their children and take their grandchildren to and from school when they were in their twenties. Only when their grandchildren were older could they return home to the home they had been used to all their lives. . After returning home, they finally no longer have to be busy, but they find that they have already fallen ill. Some people choose not to tell their children because they are afraid of using their children&#39;s money. Some people simply do not go to the hospital for a physical examination, fearing that if the problem is found, it will cause trouble for their children. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since they are the &quot;last generation of farmers&quot;, they are the &quot;last generation&quot;. Just like many villages that have experienced and are experiencing decline and decline, the torrent of the times will not pity them because of their hard work or hardship. them, or keep them. The exit of the old and the emergence of the new has always been an inevitable law of historical development and evolution, and no one can stop it. We can feel desolate, but we still need to let go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is the author&#39;s personal opinion only and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 22:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[胡适之父胡铁花之死真相]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259328]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/26/cmE0watQ4X4hR3EdC4BMdX1zy6V3ZcKH0xoxzto7.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;641&quot; height=&quot;577&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/cmE0watQ4X4hR3EdC4BMdX1zy6V3ZcKH0 xoxzto7. png&quot; data-key=&quot;255537&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hu Chuan (Hao Tiehua), the father of Hu Shi. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1895, the Qing government ceded Taiwan. Hu Shi&#39;s father, Hu Chuan, was the magistrate of Taitung Prefecture at the time. Hu Shi recalled that his father was &quot;unable to &quot;Willing to release&quot; delayed medical treatment and died, and most academic circles gave a conclusion of &quot;death from illness&quot;. The author discovered from the diary of Yuan Chang, a disciple of Zhang Zhidong, that Hu Chuan was imprisoned and blackmailed by Liu Yongfu, which worsened his condition and died on the ship back to Xiamen. Liu Yongfu finally let him go because Yuan Chang asked Zhang Zhidong to intervene. Yuan Chang was killed in 1900 for speaking out. He was a loyal and upright person, and his record deserves attention. The content of Yuan Chang&#39;s record is consistent with Hu Shi&#39;s recollection, but the wording is slightly different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Shi&#39;s father&#39;s official name was Hu Chuan, also known as Shousan and Shoushan, also known as Tiehua and Blunt Man. He experienced twists and turns in his life. He went north to Ninggu Pagoda, south to Hainan Li District, and finally arrived in Taiwan. The governor of Dongzhili Prefecture. For a long time, people have been under the impression that Hu Chuan died of illness. Luo Ergang, a disciple of Hu Shi and the famous scholar who compiled &quot;Hu Tiehua&#39;s Manuscripts&quot;, also agrees with this theory. There are many people who hold this view. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The author also believes that Hu Chuan died of illness, but he died of an aggravation of his illness due to delays in treatment in captivity, and did not die of a normal illness. Hu Shi recalled: &quot;My father was in Taitung in charge of the defense of Houshan. Telegraphs were blocked and his salary source was cut off. At that time, he had suffered from beriberi and could no longer move his left foot. He stayed there until the third day of the fifth lunar month before leaving. Back Mountain, when they arrived in Anping, Liu Yongfu insisted on keeping him for help and refused to let him go. By June 25, he could no longer move his feet, so Liu Yongfu let him go. On June 28, he arrived in Xiamen. He could no longer move, and he died in Xiamen on July 3rd.&quot; (Hu Shi&#39;s &quot;Autobiography at Forty&quot;) Hu Shi later added: &quot;But in my &quot;Autobiography at Forty&quot;, I stated that my father&#39;s death was due to beriberi. It can be cured. My father originally wanted to rush to Shanghai to seek medical treatment, but because Liu Yongfu refused to let him go, it was delayed for nearly two months. It was not until he was critically ill that he was let go. He arrived in Xiamen on June 28th and arrived in Xiamen in early July. He died at the age of three. My original intention (and the opinion of my late brother and late mother) is that my late father’s death was due to Liu Yongfu’s refusal to let him go.” (Hu Songping’s “First Draft of the Long Chronicle of Mr. Hu Shizhi”, Volume 1 Page 27) The person accompanying Hu Chuan that day was Hu Shi&#39;s second brother Shaozhi, who was also responsible for carrying the coffin back home. The situation described by Hu Shi should come from his second brother. Hu Shi&#39;s addition is extremely important and is consistent with Yuan Chang&#39;s diary records. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/8eG93hRZLCT8OzKR3OWQNDJHsCTfvSs2GHoZ85hf.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;584&quot; height= &quot;750&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/8eG93hRZLCT8OzKR3OWQNDJHsCTfvSs2GHoZ85hf.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255536&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Liu Yongfu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reading Hu Chuan&#39;s &quot;Taiwan Diary&quot;, he wrote to Tang Jingsong on the 6th of May, requesting &quot;to open a vacancy and return to his hometown for medical treatment&quot; and &quot;recover as soon as he obtains Yuan Shuangqiu&#39;s observation book from South Anhui Province.&quot; This diary entry proves that Hu Chuo&#39;s intention was to return to the mainland for medical treatment, and that he had frequent correspondence with Yuan Chang. Yuan Chang&#39;s official position at this time was Guangtai Road, Ningchi, Anhui Province, referred to as &quot;Wannan Road&quot;. Because he was stationed in Wuhu, he was sometimes referred to as &quot;Wuhu Road&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Yuan Chang&#39;s Diary&quot;, Hu Chuan was &quot;imprisoned and deprived of food&quot; by Liu Yongfu, which caused his condition to worsen. He died on the ship, and only a corpse arrived in Xiamen. Yuan Chang was a student admitted by Zhang Zhidong when he was the deputy chief examiner of Zhejiang Province in his early years. Yuan Chang&#39;s &quot;Diary of a Sanren in Bixietai Mountain&quot; collected in &quot;Diaries of the Past Dynasties&quot; has the same content as Sun Zhimei&#39;s punctuated version of &quot;Yuan Chang&#39;s Diary&quot;. It is an abridged copy of reading notes and a small number of notes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the diary, in the 22nd year of Guangxu (1896), he met Chen Wenluo (Chen Zhongying) and recalled what happened the previous year. Yuan Chang wrote in 1896: &quot;Chen Zhongying once guarded Tainan. He talked about how his late friend Hu Shousan (biography) was an official in Taitung Prefecture. He asked Liu Yongfu for a bribe of 20,000 yuan for the commander-in-chief Liu Yongfu, but he was not allowed. He was imprisoned and had no food. Yongfu originally surrendered to the thieves. It is a true act of thieves. I went to Xia to beg the governor Zhang Gong to interrogate Liu, and released Huzhou as a pastor. Before crossing the Taiwan Strait to Xiamen, he drank wine on a ship. He was so angry that he could not pursue his ambition and became ill.&quot; (Compiled by Sun Zhimei, &quot;Yuan Chang&quot; (Diary, Volume 2, page 1224) Chen Wenluo was appointed as the prefect of Taipei in 1892. He had never been stationed in Tainan, but he obeyed the order to cross over in May. Chen Wenluo is a colleague of Hu Chuan. His official experience makes his testimony irreplaceable and authoritative, and he is closest to the historical scene. Jiawu and Yiweizhangzhidong were in charge of the governor of Liangjiang, and Wuhu Road was under the governor of Liangjiang. According to the diary, it was Yuan Chang who asked Zhang Zhidong to call Liu Yongfu to release Hu Chuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the governors of the late Qing Dynasty, Zhang Zhidong paid the most attention to Yi Wei&#39;s surrender. Tang Jingsong, the governor of Taiwan, and Liu Yongfu, the assistant commander of Taiwan Defense Nan&#39;ao Town, were all supported and commanded by Zhang Zhidong during the Sino-French War. , Hu Chuanze inspected the Li District of Hainan in 1887 on the order of Zhang Zhidong. These three people all have deep connections with Zhang Zhidong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The situation in Taiwan during the Yiwei period was very complicated. Zhang Zhidong, the Governor-General of Liangjiang, ostensibly complied with the imperial court&#39;s decision to cede Taiwan. He also secretly supported Tang Jingsong and Liu Yongfu in resisting Japan and protecting Taiwan, and provided money and weapons. However, after receiving a telegram from the imperial court to challenge him, he stopped and left Tang and Liu to their own devices. Decide on orientation. Tang and Liu were originally famous generals who fought against the French, but were misled by their fame. They initially decided to stay in Taiwan to fight against the Japanese. However, their military strength could not last long. Tang Jingsong soon sneaked back to the mainland, while Liu Yongfu was &quot;overshadowed&quot; by others. Liu Yongfu felt that he had been tricked by Zhang Zhidong. When most of the local officials had been transferred inland, it was impossible to detain Hu Chuan, the magistrate of Taitung Prefecture, to demand payment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Liu Yongfu cut off support from the mainland, it was a relatively simple way to obtain military pay from local officials. After careful reading of what Chen Wenluo said about &quot;asking for bribes,&quot; I feel that it is more reasonable to interpret it as &quot;asking for salary.&quot; Liu Yongfu detained Hu Chuan and &quot;deprived him of food and drink in captivity.&quot; However, Hu Chuan had no cash in his hands, and it was very difficult to raise wages as the Japanese troops advanced deeper and deeper. Yuan Chang from Wuhu Road asked Zhang Zhidong for help and called Liu Yongfu to release him. Hu Chuan died on the ship returning to Xiamen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Chuan died because he was imprisoned by Liu Yongfu and fasted, which delayed his treatment and his condition worsened. This was not a normal death. During the Sino-French War, Tang Jingsong took the initiative to sneak into Vietnam and fight side by side with Liu Yongfu. He had a deeper understanding of Liu Yongfu. In 1884, he reported to the court through Cen Yuying, the governor of Yunnan and Guizhou, saying that Liu Yongfu &quot;valued wealth too much, treated his subordinates with little kindness, and showed no mercy.&quot; No discipline.&quot; (Page 91 of Volume 1 of &quot;The Telegram of Duke Zhang Wenxiang (Unpublished)&quot;) Linking this phrase with the way he treated Hu Chuan in 1895, another side of Liu Yongfu&#39;s character becomes apparent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[在何种情况下，以色列会使用核武器？丨军事]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259428]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/25/lPGP575q0cEcOl9oyhbIVi2CCvaUQuFNCyKKvSjE.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/lPGP575q0cEcOl9oyhbIVi2CCvaUQuFNCyKK vSjE. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255391&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The northern Gaza Strip was attacked in Sderot, Israel, on October 23, 2023.

Jericho missile! Strategic alert. Before considering troops entering. Doomsday weapon (used)! This is mine Viewpoint.

It’s time to kiss the end of the world. Launch powerful missiles without limit. Don’t level a neighborhood, smash and level the entire Gaza…nothing Show no mercy! Show no mercy!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, this is an outright nuclear threat. Gottliff is a lawyer and an opponent of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Her remarks have always been known for being extreme and crazy, so her extreme remarks this time were not regarded by anyone as a serious nuclear threat. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, we have to admit the fact that Israel is indeed the only country in the Middle East that possesses nuclear weapons, and it almost decided to use nuclear weapons to save the defeat in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although there is now a lot of public opinion that if anti-Israel allies such as Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah join the war, Hamas&#39;s goal of completely destroying Israel is expected to be achieved. But even if we do not take into account the fact that the combined conventional military strength of these opponents is still far behind that of Israel, as well as the fact that two US aircraft carriers are within easy reach, and only consider the existence of Israel&#39;s nuclear power, if Israel is completely defeated, this war will be The possibility of escalation to a nuclear war cannot be ruled out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So is Israel ready to use nuclear weapons in reality? To answer this question, we first need to understand what kind of nuclear power Israel has and what is the positioning of its nuclear strategy? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because Israel does not accept the supervision of its nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and the Israeli government has always implemented a vague nuclear strategy, neither admitting nor denying the possession of nuclear weapons, and has not announced the deployment of its nuclear weapons to the outside world, the outside world is very concerned. It is difficult to know exactly how many nuclear weapons Israel possesses and whether the nuclear weapons are in a state of war readiness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The international arms control research community now generally believes that Israel possesses at least 90 nuclear weapons and also retains key nuclear materials that can produce 200-300 nuclear weapons. Although Israel&#39;s nuclear weapons are very small, it is one of the very few countries with a triad of nuclear strike capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Israel has the Jericho medium-range ballistic missile with a range that can cover the entire Middle East and parts of Africa and Asia. This system is considered the core of Israel’s land-based nuclear strike force, among which the latest Jericho The Type 3 missile has a range of up to 4,800 kilometers, enough to cover Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, and even Moscow, the capital of Russia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both the Israeli Air Force’s F-16 and F-15 fighter jets are capable of carrying nuclear bombs. The outside world even generally believes that Israel’s customized F-35 fighter jets will have the ability to drop nuclear bombs. It is expected that the Israeli Air Force’s There are at least 30 aerial nuclear bombs similar to the American B-61 type in the arsenal. This is the core of Israel&#39;s first-hand nuclear strike force. It maintains a very high level of combat readiness and can launch nuclear attacks from the air at any time, posing a threat to surrounding hostile countries. Very big. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以色列也是极少数拥有水下核力量的国家，尽管它并未装备核动力潜艇，然而已在其海军服役的海豚级常规动力潜艇装备了核巡航导弹，在以色列陆空军都不复存在的情况下，潜艇部队仍可执行末日打击任务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种三位一体的核打击能力，使得以色列虽然国土面积狭小，却拥有超越英法的核战斗力，是少数能对主要威慑目标实施先发制人核打击的国家。如果以色列确实面临灭国风险，最后时刻极有可能使用核武器孤注一掷。实际上，以色列的核威慑力量成型也是在第四次中东战争之后，这也是埃及等世俗阿拉伯国家决定与以色列关系正常化的战略考量之一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;戈特利夫议员宣称应对加沙使用核武器显然只是个人言论。无论以色列如何疯狂，核爆后的辐射尘埃对于近在咫尺的以色列而言，都是不能接受的灾难性后果。然而如果战事扩大，伊朗直接参战，那么以色列动用核武器却并非是不可能的选项。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年5月以色列曾与美国共同演习打击伊朗的核设施，而以色列的作战计划中很可能也包括在极端状况下对伊朗发动核打击的选项。这次哈马斯的袭击普遍被认为是赎罪日战争之后以色列所遭遇到的最糟糕状况，若1973年以色列有过实施核打击的准备，那么这次也不排除会有相关的预案。更糟糕的是，现在以军核武器的数量和使用手段已经远超当年。因此，国际社会对以色列准备动用核武器的可能性和危害性，应当有所戒备。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;于是，我就很高兴地给自己配了冰鲜海虾、文蛤和龙头鱼。店家问我要不要蛏子，我告知不吃蛏子，吃了会腹痛的，店家就拿着我选好的海鲜到后厨去了。我又想起俱乐部领队的提醒，去吃海鲜面要问清楚多少钱，她上次去吃没问被多收了不少，于是特地问了价格。老板顿了一下，说是48元。我有点小惊讶，心想，这海鲜面我今年一路吃下来从不超过30元的，现在一涨就涨了50%多？又一想，这48元也不是什么大数目，也就默认了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;等了一会儿，海鲜面上来了。我因为饿了，拿起筷子就吃，鲜没有尝出来，却吃出了很多的不对劲：怎么里面有蛏子？我选了三条十几厘米长的龙头鱼，怎么只有小小的三段？那个虾的壳怎么脆脆的，虾肉怎么干干的，不像冰鲜，倒像是晒干的？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我老公吃的是快餐，先于我吃好，吃好后就去付了钱。我吃过后，心有不甘，找老板理论，质疑他们食材掉了包。这下可好了，店里的三四个人围住我们，七嘴八舌，蛮横地否认我的质疑。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我问：“你们这家店谁做主？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我。”老板说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“那好，其他人闭嘴。我们和你交涉。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;老板问：“你想怎么办？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我说：“退我钱。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他问：“全退？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我想了想，说：“那倒也不是，面我也吃了，退20元。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;老板瞪大眼睛，提高嗓门：“什么？不可能的！你去投诉好了！”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;之前我真没有想到投诉，他这么一说，我也火了，直接拨打了12345热线电话。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大概一个小时后，我接到了一个电话，说是市场监管局的，已经到了现场，问我是不是投诉店家在海鲜面里多加了蛏子。我一听，大为惊讶，居然把食材掉包定性得这么清新脱俗，忙说，我把事情复盘给你吧。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;言简意赅地复述了一遍，对方说，等他核实一下再做处置。过了一会儿，电话来了，说是在后厨没有发现干虾，蛏子是后厨误放进去的，我这边也没有相应的证据，所以，不做处理。我道，不接受这样的结果，老板一开始就有恃无恐地让我“去投诉好了”，是不是吃定你们胳膊往里弯的？我要继续向上一级部门投诉。之前投诉的是：一、价格偏离市场行情，有宰客嫌疑；二、食材掉包；三、态度恶劣。如果你们坚持这样的态度，那么就再加一条：地方保护。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;50分钟后，电话来了，一是老板愿意就态度和弄错食材向我道歉，二是愿意退回20元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事情到了这里，是不是应该高兴一下？不不不，我一点都高兴不起来，吃一碗海鲜面味道不好不说，居然要打12345，市场监管人员还给你和个稀泥。虽说事情最终确实得到了处理，但我总觉得如果没有我的“威胁”，这事就会不了了之。如果事情的解决要靠这样的“威胁”才有推进，未免使人感到沮丧。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;12345，我一直信任有加，因为她的为人民服务的意识，因为她的高效的办事效率，因为她的事事有回应、件件有着落的作风。在我的这个投诉中，相应的职能部门人员一个多小时就赶到了现场，工作效率不谓不高。但如果就事论事，我觉得在这件事情的处置上，还是存在瑕疵的。如果存有公正之心，对本地商家不偏袒，对外地游客不敷衍，那么我也不会感到那么遗憾了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那天傍晚，我们来到了这个海岛的一个网红村子，看到有人在吃海鲜面，就问了价格，回说30元。做海鲜面的是一对年逾古稀的老夫妇，我问他们，海鲜面里放些什么海鲜，老妇人答曰，有活的虾，有蛏子，有文蛤，还有一个荷包蛋。我们愉快地叫了两碗海鲜面，里面的蛏子都归我老公吃，吹着海风，听着海涛，看月亮一点点升上来，这个感觉，很好。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在我们吃面的时间里，我看到这对老夫妇卖出了十几碗面。我粗略算了算，一碗面的成本大致10元，这样一天他们的收入还是蛮可观的。一碗30元的海鲜面，店家有得赚，游客能接受，多和谐的生态！想不通有些商家为什么还要宰客，宰着宰着不怕把自己的生意给宰没了？&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（作者为退休教师）&lt;/p>;

border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1417&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/27/c44527be08.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255765&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;付豚豚挑战坐高铁二等座被卡住。受访者供图&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;以下是“大码女孩”付豚豚的自述：&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“我们是不能说话的群体”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;我叫付豚豚，但我不姓付。我在幼儿园第一个朋友姓付，很多年我都联系不上她，叫这个姓是想纪念她。“豚豚”，是因为有一天我爸开玩笑说，我好像一只海豚在床上翻来覆去的，那就是这个名字了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;但我没想到，网友可以根据“豚”，联想到“猪”。我是因为身体有甲减和甲状腺（疾病），一直瘦不下来。从小到大，我一直被骂“肥猪”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;前期就策划想拍这样一则坐高铁的视频，太远的地方我不敢去，朋友说去清远，从广州过去不到半个小时。我说试试，就直接过去了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;我挤进高铁座位之后，突然发现比隔壁高那么多，屁股是有点紧张的状态，后腰因为有赘肉，卡得很紧。我当时穿的裙子有点膨，也不敢把扶手收起来，怕身体像水一样溢出来，非常尴尬。走过道也是这样的，我穿那件蓬蓬裙把过道都占满了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;一开始他们跟我说上微博火了，我第一反应是先回家躲起来，问粉丝和同事可不可以帮我看评论，我不敢看，好像会被网暴。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在发视频前，我猜到可能会有一些人骂，但没想到网友们骂得五花八门，看都看不过来。有一个粉丝在网上帮我说话，被七千多个网友网暴，有人说我不是大码，是特大码。我还收到一个女生私信，“建议你自杀，恶心的东西”，之后就把我拉黑了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;视频走红后，付豚豚收到的网络私信。受访者供图&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/27/ffae1bde1e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;607&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/27/ffae1bde1e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255766&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;视频走红后，付豚豚收到的网络私信。受访者供图&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;有趣的是，也有蛮多人喜欢我，他们可能会评论“喜欢你”“你很漂亮”。也有很多大码姐妹说，她们也遇到过这个事情，从小时候就被叫“肥猪”。就感觉我们是一个普通的群体，但也是一个不能说话的群体。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;我们一出门，就会被讨论。想保持平和的心态都做不到，恰巧大家都默不作声，可能每个人都觉得自己是个例，说出来也没有人帮我们。有些人对我们已经到了看到就厌恶的程度，之前我在城中村还被一个大爷吐口水。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;有一次，我在路边等公交，旁边一对情侣讨论我。女的说，“如果胖成这样，你还会爱我吗”。男的说，“你怎么可能胖成这种猪一样，我会爱你的”。他们跟我一起上车，又在公交车上说了我一路。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;前段时间，我在地铁口突然被人揪住，是一个跟我年龄差不多的女生，她问我多少斤，我说286斤。她说“你这样你还吃饭，怪不得长那么胖，你这样很容易死的”。虽然我看起来很大只，但跟她们吵架，我一直是哭的那个人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;也有人说，如果我是男生，可能就不会被这么说了。因为在大众的概念里面，比较高壮的男生，被挑衅以后暴打的几率比较大，但女生可能就忍过去了。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“很多场合我不能参与”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;有些时候，别人很轻易就能做到的事情，对我来说很难。我会提前想好要不要干，避免碰到很尴尬的点。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;比如我进地铁，基本不坐，一般就靠角落站着，因为我坐下去就会占1.5个位置。有时刚坐下，旁边的人就自动弹开了。还有一个原因是，胖人确实容易出汗，夏天穿得少，如果碰到别人之后会很尴尬。我从小到大都没有踩过别人的脚，也没有专门去挤过别人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;我没有去过外面的城市，到现在也没坐过飞机。我坐高铁都这样挤，飞机的宽度更窄，可能容不下我。我在单位就坐坏了两个转椅，之前也因为挤电梯超重，默默退出来，很尴尬的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;还有更尴尬的事。我有次租房，不想弄坏房东的床垫，就换成自己的薄垫，结果我坐了一下，下面的合成木板就出现了屁股大的洞，陷下去了。床板要找人回收，工作人员把床板抬下去的时候，我捂住脸，想找个地缝钻进去。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;像聚餐我也不太去，会提前看一下这家店的凳子我能不能坐。有一些大排档的塑料凳，我们坐上去很容易摔，还把人家凳子坐坏了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;出门住酒店时，我也总担心床会塌，会提前看一下床。没有任何东西是能让我很随意的定下来的，虽然这么说有点夸张，但真是这样，每次出行，我都会提前看很多东西。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;这也是导致我性格比较内向的原因之一，因为很多场合我不能参与。有时候大家出去玩，我这个玩不了，那个玩不了。作为朋友，他们也不想让我落单，可能会留下来陪我，我不想这样子。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;还有健身房追着我卖卡，我走在路上也会被围着。他们都觉得我像大客户，那种长期持卡者。实际上我真这么干，一直都有健身卡，不同的地方我都买过。从2016年开始，我就在学校附近办年卡，有空就去。上班以后也办，有回报了个很贵的课程，一百多块钱一节课，最后健身房跑路了，我还有二十多节课没上，亏死。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;他们的销售话术我熟到能背出来，前不久还有家保健品店的销售带我去店里玩游戏，玩得很开心。然后拿出来一个产品，说喝了就会变瘦，他们觉得我很好骗，但他确实赚到我的钱了。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“生活的全部是减肥”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;我记性不好，有些伤心的事偶尔想起来会难过一下。有一天，他们问我减肥经历了什么，我一边想一边哭，想起了很多遭遇，哭到停不下来，胖确实给我加了很多心理阴影。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;我是广东人，在南方长大，周边的人都跟杆子一样瘦。但我小学二年级就有80斤，看起来圆圆的，初中到了120斤，身高1米68也会被说胖，高中体重到160多斤，同学都喊我猛男。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;哥哥从小就比我瘦，我们俩出去，他们都说我把我哥的饭全都抢了，其实没有，我们俩一直吃一样的东西。上学时，班里同学会直接把我当成壮丁，扛书扛水搬东西，运动会被安排扔铅球，但其实不一定胖的人都力气大。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;我生活的全部就是减肥，一直减肥，一直没成功，减得我很崩溃。只要稍稍吃一点点碳水，体重就会很快涨起来，锻炼也没用。在外面看那些吃的东西，这个不能买，那个热量高。比如糖炒栗子我不吃，广东很常见的炒米粉、河粉、肠粉这些我也不能碰。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;上大学时，为了能够更好融入集体，我节食减肥，确实瘦了二十多斤，但是我身体出了问题，脱发，生理期也紊乱了。而且我一饿会发慌，整个人很虚脱。减肥因为各种原因撑不下去，那种放弃已经长期存在我的人生里。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;去年，我报了一个瘦身训练营，脱产三个月训练，学费15000元。60个学员里面，跟我差不多体型的可能有六七个人，我们互相鼓励。早上7点多起床，做健身操，下午练力量型的杠铃哑铃，晚上骑动感单车，一群人像蹦迪一样。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;每天要练四五个小时。一顿饭只有三勺米饭，搭配一小格素菜和很小一格子肉。但因为我吃的东西太少，锻炼有点撑不上劲。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;练到第三个月，大家都在咳嗽，但还是一边咳一边跳操，整个包房全是咳嗽的声音，很响。所以大码的女生她不想减吗？她不想努力吗？我们坚持了3个月，可最后我只减掉了22斤。我问教练，我没有偷吃东西，为什么瘦不下去？他说，“你就不要吃。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;后来我去医院检查，抽了11管血，查出了胰岛素抵抗和甲减，我代谢功能差，比大部分人瘦得慢，可能正常人减肥一天掉一两斤，我一星期才掉一两斤。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;2022年，付豚豚参加瘦身训练营。受访者供图&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/27/567c16cc49.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;749&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;我确实在很多的环境里面被排斥，在家里也无法被容纳，其中有六成原因是我的身材，我爸妈可能会向别人宣扬他儿子有多厉害，但从不宣扬我，觉得丢人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;所以我很少回家，不敢回去，每次都被人说。很多亲戚会劝我减肥，他们要说什么我都能背得出来。我妈会指着一个碟子问我，“你知道这是什么吗？你的脸就像这么圆。”你也知道她是开玩笑，但刀子永远是扎心的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;我退到无路可退，只会跳入一个更大的坑，我真的会跳下去。有段时间，我因为在公司受排挤，家里关系紧张，减肥又减不好，很失落。我们公司在18楼，我跨在栏杆上想跳下去。正巧有个附近工作认识的朋友发消息问我，要不要出来吃个雪糕。那条消息让我突然醒了一下，好像也有人关心我。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;我想，我可能真的没有办法生存下去了。我一个人吃饭，一个人走路，躲在房子里不愿意见人，崩溃过几次，也抑郁过，在很静音的状态中度过了一年。那一年。我哥哥每个月会打一次电话，他只问两句，你还好吗？还活着吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;直到后来跟家人关系缓和了一些，慢慢走出来了。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“做一些自己害怕的事”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;改变是从一次野外活动开始的。之前我跟公司的人团建，几十个人去玩山地摩托越野车。一开局，大家跑开了100米，就我的摩托车一直熄火。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;我也很着急，不想掉队，旁边的教练很不耐烦地说，“你这样很危险的，不要开了，我退钱给你。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;我同事看不下去，他怼了一句教练，“人家不会，你就教人家，为什么要叫人家下来？”我很感动，好久没人这样支持我了。教练教我以后，我刚开出去一会儿又死机了。教练又说，“不要开了，你下来，我退票给你，保险都退给你好吗。”我说你再让我试一次，就再试一次。那次我真的开上去了，虽然中途我熄火了十几次。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;你知道吗？到了很高的地方，我的车几乎要翻过来。坡很陡，车子要急速往上冲，我的体重可能会把速度拖慢。但我后来看那段路不止我过不去，很多人也过不去，还有体重太轻的，车真的翻了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;到山顶以后，几个教练问我合影。我以为他们又开我玩笑，但听一个教练说，“这个女孩很棒，一开始她一直在熄火，现在开到这里，真的很棒。”他夸我哎，那天心里一直都很暖。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;付豚豚骑越野摩托车。受访者供图&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/27/062697426b.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;811&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/27/062697426b.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;还有一次，健身房的朋友抓我登山，约好去一个比较高的风景区，爬几百级的阶梯。一开始我不敢上，有个妹妹每一层都拉着我，每上十几层台阶我就往回看，想着我等一下怎么下去，最后我是在台阶上躺着往下试探，一小步一小步挪下去的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;他们扶我，我说不要，我怕连你们一起滚下去，那天心跳飙到180。但每次铁着头去干我不敢干的事情以后，都能长点勇气值。后来，我还挑战坐过山车和旋转木马，比如铁索桥这种景点，我以前没办法接受，总担心我上去它就断了，后来也尝试了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;我确实很害怕各种东西。可能以前生活的全部都是减肥，但现在我想去做一些自己害怕的事情，用其他事情充实自己。我也希望“大码女孩”这个群体站出来，勇敢一些，被大家看见。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 18:25:11 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[深秋青海：如诗如画]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259290]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国家烟草专卖局原局长凌成兴落马，反腐震荡至烟草系统最高级别]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259432]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/27/JQJFMogZw7WnI1B7dpthiLXvmzRWXL7acvFQXdak.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;凌成兴曾提出“防止(控烟)扩大化、片面化、绝对化”。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（视觉中国/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年10月23日，中纪委通报，中国国家烟草专卖局原党组书记、局长凌成兴涉嫌严重违纪违法，目前正接受中央纪委国家监委纪律审查和监察调查。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;值得注意的是，三天前中纪委宣布，中央第八巡视组巡视国家烟草专卖局党组工作动员会召开，将“突出对&#39;一把手&#39;和领导班子的监督，深入查找关键岗位、重点领域的腐败问题”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;今年以来，国家烟草局已有多名前任官员落马。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;原党组成员、副局长何泽华7月被查，科技司原司长张虹7月被查。凌成兴则是国家烟草专卖局自成立以来，级别最高的落马官员。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此前，原党组成员、副局长赵洪顺在2019年2月被查，原党组成员、纪检组组长潘家华于2022年1月被查。赵洪顺已于2020年6月被判处无期徒刑，潘家华于2023年4月被判处有期徒刑11年。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;仕途的起点&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;凌成兴被查之前，烟草系统已经持续地震中，多位厅局级干部密集落马，遍布云南、安徽、江苏等地，其中凌成兴仕途的起点——江西更是重灾区。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年7月1日，江西省烟草专卖局（公司）原处级干部李本坚接受纪律审查和监察调查。据财新报道，此人曾担任过凌成兴的司机。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;4月6日，广东省烟草专卖局（公司）党组书记、局长、总经理郑伟落马，他此前是江西中烟总经理。同一天，江西中烟人力资源部一级业务经理付武军接受纪律审查和监察调查。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;江西省上高县是凌成兴仕途的起点，他1980年参加工作，27岁便升任上高县常委、副县长。此后，他曾担任江西省烟草专卖局局长，最终成为江西省委常委、常务副省长。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2015年，凌成兴正是在江西被选举为全国人大代表，一位曾在两会上采访过凌成兴的媒体人告诉南方周末记者，席间讨论时，大家还是称呼凌成兴为“省长”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2018年退休后，凌成兴对家乡上高依然非常关心，退休后唯一一次公开亮相就是在当地县委书记、县人大主任等人陪同下参观家乡的供水企业。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;腐败重灾区&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2013年－2018年，凌成兴出任工业和信息化部党组成员，国家烟草专卖局党组书记、局长。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他在任期间，2015年中国卷烟销售量下滑2.4%，是1995年以来首次下滑，相当于烟民减少消费600亿支香烟。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;原因在于，2015年5月10日起上调烟草税，幅度为6个百分点，将卷烟批发环节的价税税率由5%提高至11%，并按0.005元/支加征从量税。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;面对销量下降的趋势，一向低调的凌成兴主动接受了中共中央党校主办的《学习时报》采访，提出“防止(控烟)扩大化、片面化、绝对化”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2015年全国两会时，这也成为了记者追问的焦点，什么是控烟扩大化？凌成兴回答说：“我举个例子，有人说骨质增生都是抽烟引起的，我认为这没有科学依据，您说呢？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;到了2017年，中国卷烟销量止跌反升，全年卖出4737.8万箱，较2016年增长0.8%。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在控烟的讨论中，烟草业政企合一的体制，一直都是讨论的焦点。在控烟一方眼中，政企合一的体制已成为中国控烟的最大障碍。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;凌成兴的前任，国家烟草专卖局原党组书记、局长姜成康，对中国烟草业最大的制度性改革是力推了省级层面的“工商分离”，但改革未能再进一步。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;凌成兴上任后，沿用此前的思路，通过兼并与联合等手段迅速扩张企业规模。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他上任后调研的第一站就选在了云南，红云集团和红河集团合并后，新成立的“红云红河集团”成为了继奥驰亚集团、英美烟草、日本烟草、帝国烟草公司后的世界第五大烟草集团。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2013年5月30日，云产卷烟大品牌培育座谈会在红河州弥勒县举行，刚刚接任国家烟草专卖局局长的凌成兴第一次发表烟草“施政纲领”：坚持“三个不变”（年初确定的指导思想不变、目标任务不变、工作举措不变）；保持“三个稳定”（稳定领导班子、稳定干部队伍、稳定职工人心）；思考、谋划、实践“三大课题”（烟草行业改革的红利在哪里、发展的潜力在哪里、追赶的目标在哪里）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;凌成兴任内也推行了多项改革，从2014年开始，国家烟草专卖局连续四年印发《卷烟营销市场化取向改革工作要点》，但仅限于营销层面，重点是“商业企业如何真实反映市场需求，工业企业如何及时满足需求，提升工商企业对市场需求的响应速度”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与之前中国烟草直面与外资品牌竞争的“外患”不同，凌成兴面对的更多是来自内部的管理压力，在他任内，烟草系统出现了多起大案。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2012年，河南省烟草专卖局爆发窝案，包括原局长在内的多人被捕。还有与云南烟草科学研究院相关联的云南瑞升集团董事长杨伟祖案。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;十八大以来，烟草系统至少已有十几名中管干部落马。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2020年10月被查的湖南中烟工业有限责任公司党组书记、总经理卢平，涉嫌收受贿赂4.13亿元，挪用公款1.35亿元。该案被称为新中国成立以来烟草系统职务犯罪之最。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位纪检干部向南方周末记者分析了对烟草系统腐败原因的看法，“烟草系统和其他垂直管理的部门不同，它是政企合一的体系，权力的变现路径很短，所有环节都伴随着指标，这导致权力永远集中在少数人手中，又缺乏有效的监督，使得烟草系统的反腐败难度更大”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;烟草局手中甚至还掌握着地方政府的钱袋子。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一个有意思的细节是，2015年全国两会时，曾有市长公开向凌成兴喊话，想提高卷烟生产的档次，“原来基本以代加工七匹狼为主，七匹狼税利比较低。如果下一步代生产中华烟那不得了”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这遭到了凌成兴的当场驳斥，“那不可能。中华烟是烟草行业一面旗帜”。该市长笑称，“可能不可能都是（老）省长一支笔”，并提出可以投入更好的设备进行生产。凌成兴仍坚称，“你们来搞中华烟，马上把中华烟（牌子）给砸了”。&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随后，该市长继续表示，“趁着（老）省长在总局这个位子上，某某市烟草产业链税收争取到100个亿。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者了解到，当时这一段媒体记录在凌成兴的授意下得以保留，据知情人士透露，“他可能就是想展现自己拒绝了对方这一幕”。当年提出这一诉求的市长，不久后就因牵涉苏荣案而落马。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 16:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
