After rescue efforts by the mine rescue team, the fire has been extinguished and the temperature and gas at the working surface have returned to normal.

Among them, the &quot;Basic Funeral Services&quot; refusal to trade dispute case involves the identification and legal liability of public enterprises&#39; refusal to trade, which is worth mentioning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the website of the Supreme People&#39;s Court, the basic facts of this typical case are: Quanzhou Licheng Lisheng Funeral Service Co., Ltd. (Lisheng Company), which is mainly engaged in funeral intermediary services, sued for the prosecution of Quanzhou Jiying Funeral Service Co., Ltd. (Jiying Company) is a public enterprise that provides basic funeral services such as cremation of remains. Because Lisheng Company reported that Jiying Company charged illegally, Jiying Company refused Lisheng Company to apply for cremation services on behalf of the relatives of the deceased, which violated the regulations. In accordance with the provisions of the Anti-Monopoly Law prohibiting administrative monopoly, we requested a court to order Jiying Company to resume handling relevant business for Lisheng Company and to compensate for economic losses of 80,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The court of first instance held that Lisheng Company failed to prove that Jiying Company was the executive entity of the administrative monopoly regulated by the Anti-Monopoly Law, and ruled to reject all claims of Lisheng Company. Lisheng Company was dissatisfied and appealed, claiming that Jiying Company&#39;s refusal was an abuse of market dominance prohibited by the Anti-Monopoly Law. The second instance of the Supreme Court found that Jiying Company, as a public enterprise with a monopoly position in the basic funeral service market in central Quanzhou, refused to handle relevant business for Lisheng Company, constituting a refusal to trade prohibited by the Anti-Monopoly Law, and ruled that Jiying Company Compensate Lisheng Company for losses of RMB 80,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The trial process of this case is very interesting. In the first instance, Lisheng Company held that Jiying Company&#39;s refusal to trade with it violated the provisions of the Anti-Monopoly Law prohibiting administrative monopoly. The court of first instance held that Lisheng Company failed to prove that Jiying Company was the executive entity of the administrative monopoly regulated by the Anti-Monopoly Law, so it rejected Lisheng Company&#39;s appeal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what are the provisions of the Anti-Monopoly Law on administrative monopoly? According to Chapter 5 of the Anti-Monopoly Law, administrative agencies and organizations authorized by laws and regulations to manage public affairs shall not abuse administrative power to exclude or restrict competition. From a legal perspective, the implementing entities of administrative monopoly should be “administrative agencies and organizations authorized by laws and regulations to manage public affairs.” On the surface, Jiying Company is an enterprise, not an administrative agency, and is not authorized by laws and regulations to manage public affairs. It does not seem qualified to be the subject of administrative monopoly. So what kind of company is Jiying Company? After digging through the layers, it was discovered that Jiying Company is a state-owned company 100% controlled by the Quanzhou State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. More importantly, Jiying Company operates the only funeral parlor in the main urban area of ​​Quanzhou City. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yes, funeral parlors in other places are generally public institutions affiliated with the civil affairs department, but Quanzhou City hands over the operation of funeral parlors to a state-owned enterprise. This state-owned enterprise is responsible for providing basic funeral services, including cremation of remains, in the main urban area of ​​Quanzhou City. This is the only funeral home in the main urban area of ​​Quanzhou that can provide cremation services. According to the reply letter to the CPPCC members&#39; proposal published by the Quanzhou Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau in 2019, the funeral business in the main urban area of ​​Quanzhou was transferred to Jiying Group for management. In other words, Jiying Company’s monopoly on the basic funeral service market in the main urban area of ​​Quanzhou is the result of administrative transfer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is it legal for a state-owned enterprise that provides basic public services, which is in a monopoly position due to administrative orders, to refuse to trade with a downstream enterprise because it reported that it charged excessively? The court of first instance rejected the plaintiff&#39;s petition on the grounds that the defendant was not a qualified subject of administrative monopoly. There seemed to be nothing wrong with the procedure. However, it objectively maintained Jiying Company&#39;s monopoly status and made it impossible for the plaintiff to carry out normal operations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, during the appeal, Lisheng Company changed its strategy and claimed that Jiying Company’s refusal was an abuse of market dominance and refusal to trade. The Supreme Court also held in the second instance that Jiying Company is a public enterprise with an exclusive position in the local basic funeral service market, and the basic funeral services it provides are specific services that are indispensable for the downstream funeral intermediary companies to carry out services, and the downstream funeral agencies There is no alternative to the agency. Jiying Company refused to handle relevant business for Lisheng Company, which resulted in Lisheng Company being completely excluded from the funeral agency service market in downtown Quanzhou, excluding and limiting competition in the funeral agency service market, and damaging its reputation as a countermeasures company. The interests of consumers’ relatives of the deceased in the sense of the Monopoly Law constitute a refusal to trade prohibited by the Anti-Monopoly Law. Therefore, it was ruled that Jiying Company should resume Lisheng Company’s application for the cremation business on behalf of the relatives of the deceased under legal and compliant conditions, and compensate them The refusal to trade caused a loss of 80,000 yuan to Lisheng Company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the relevant judgment documents published on the China Judgment Documents Network, the cause of the incident was a business of renting ice coffins to store remains in October 2019. The plaintiff believed that the defendant had illegally charged an extra 200 yuan in rent. Complaints to market regulatory authorities. After that, the defendant no longer accepted the plaintiff’s application to the defendant for cremation of remains on behalf of the deceased’s family. In order to protect their rights and interests, the plaintiff complained to the Quanzhou Municipal Market Supervision Bureau, Civil Affairs Bureau, and National Development and Reform Commission, and took the civil affairs, municipal supervision and other departments to court many times for administrative inaction. However, these complaints and lawsuits all failed without exception. Even in the first-instance civil lawsuit heard by the intermediate court in another place, there was still no support. It wasn&#39;t until he appealed to the Supreme Court that he was finally supported. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar phenomena are not uncommon. Some local governments transfer the responsibility of certain basic public services to state-owned enterprises, which is called marketization and actually forms an administrative monopoly. These state-owned enterprises have an absolute monopoly in this field of public services and may even be assigned some management functions that should be the responsibility of the administrative department. Their leaders are often close to the regulatory authorities. Therefore, these state-owned enterprises are often arrogant when facing downstream enterprises or consumers. Once downstream companies or consumers mess with such state-owned enterprises, they will be put in the shoes of others. Just like in this case, because Lisheng Company complained about Jiying Company&#39;s excessive charges, Jiying Company used the excuse that Lisheng Company violated laws and regulations during the funeral process and refused to allow Lisheng Company to handle the cremation business on behalf of the family of the deceased. However, it is very difficult for downstream companies or consumers to safeguard their rights. Locally, they will basically encounter obstacles everywhere, and they can only be solved at a higher level or even at the central level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although this kind of public service provision by enterprises designated by administrative power does not comply with the legal provisions on &quot;administrative monopoly&quot; on the surface, it is essentially the same as administrative monopoly. They both rely on administrative power to monopolize the market. Put on a pair of &quot;corporate&quot; white gloves. These &quot;public enterprises&quot; with monopoly status should not be viewed with caution against administrative monopolies to prevent them from using their monopoly status to harm the interests of upstream and downstream enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 24 Sep 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[在德国小镇，偶遇“乱世佳人”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257446]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-24 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/20/2xLRyrFir4VYv8Pl4SihiUfphbeTRVncavXAsDeI.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/2xLRyrFir4VYv8Pl4SihiUfphbeTRVncavXAsDeI. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251388&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Portrait of Barbara and herself when she was young&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa ;&quot;>;(Children&#39;s words/pictures)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meeting Barbara and her story was a completely unexpected gain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I originally just came to see an old friend. She settled in Rothenburg, Germany, a small town that even Germans are not very familiar with. After not seeing each other for many years, my friend and I wasted no time chatting, and the topic somehow ended up on her German mother-in-law, Barbara. My friend really wanted me to talk to this old lady. Before I could ask why, she couldn’t help but introduce Barbara’s life: she was born into a wealthy manor family, and later became a refugee. It was like the movie &quot; Scarlett in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I had already smelled the flavor of the story. It happened to be that Friday, and my friend made an appointment to go to my mother-in-law’s house, so I quickly followed. The walk to Barbara&#39;s house was short, just through the garden from the back door of a friend&#39;s house. The kitchen door opened, and a silver-haired old man walked out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/Ewe46mb8M527fPetxAplol6ggihKhOi2qtw1apBB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/Ewe46mb8M527fPetxAplol6ggihKhOi2qtw1apBB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251386&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Barbara&#39;s family&#39;s manor&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Children&#39;s words/pictures)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First meeting with Barbara Bara, I can&#39;t help but marvel: This old lady is so tough! He walks steadily and has a loud voice. He doesn&#39;t look like he is 93 years old. After her husband&#39;s death, Barbara lived alone for more than ten years. Not only did she take care of her own daily life and food, but she also took care of the two-story house and large garden. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Seeing me as an unexpected guest, Barbara generously invited me in. A friend suggested that we sit at the dining table and chat. Barbara pretended to be angry and shook her head: &quot;How can we sit comfortably?&quot; She moved the brewed tea and small cakes to the coffee table at the end of the living room. The room was a little dark, so Barbara turned on the light, turned to the room, took out two photo albums, and placed them in front of me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/OcMHVTXqMHcQe2kwEIEp8f4ukEVBp6ihHTZqqzLr.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/OcMHVTXqMHcQe2kwEIEp8f4ukEVBp6ihHTZqqzLr.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251390&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The three Barbara sisters and their mother&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Children&#39;s words/pictures)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This It’s my old home,” Barbara said. She pointed to a black and white photo in the center of the album&#39;s home page. The pixels were very low and a bit blurry, but I could still tell that it was a large castle-like house that could accommodate at least a dozen luxurious suites. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Barbara, who was born in 1931, has lived in this big house with her two sisters since she was a child. Her family is very wealthy, and the town where the manor is located, whether it is farmland, shops or churches, is all Barbara&#39;s family property. They hired thousands of employees to take care of everything in the manor. Barbara&#39;s childhood was pampered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But such a privileged life came to an abrupt end when Barbara was 14 years old. In 1945, Germany was defeated and the country was occupied by partitions. Barbara&#39;s family estate was located on the border of East and West Germany, and was transferred to East Germany at the last minute. If they were ordinary people, they might not be affected too much. The prominence of the Barbara family and the &quot;corrupt farmer life&quot; they lived made them the target of public criticism. On the eve of the end of the war, the Soviet army that took over captured Barbara&#39;s father and gave orders to other family members to pack up and leave within 4 hours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/yoMl9Fb7ylFmYAlyagMxakIViKgJyJrPZuxY4mGV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/yoMl9Fb7ylFmYAlyagMxakIViKgJyJrPZuxY4mGV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251389&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Barbara&#39;s Little Bear&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Children&#39;s words/pictures)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One night During this time, Barbara was reduced from an aristocratic lady to a refugee. Fortunately, thanks to my mother&#39;s bravery and resourcefulness, the family of five was able to reunite safely. They climbed onto the train in the dark, crossed the border, and hid with relatives in West Germany. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From then on, Barbara not only had to take care of her own life, but also had to learn farm work from scratch. When I asked Barbara if she ever felt particularly miserable, she smiled. She is always smiling, and when she talks about the past, it feels like she is describing someone else&#39;s adventure story, without any resentment or sadness on her face. She even looked like a child, her shoulders curled up when she was happy, and she leaned on the sofa with a smile on her face. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Barbara said that she did not feel bitter at all, but felt extremely lucky. After all, the family was intact. She only remembers the ruins of post-war towns, or the happy times she spent laughing in the rice fields with her family. Later, they came to settle in the small town of Rothenburg. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The war delayed Barbara&#39;s studies, but she has always had a dream to become a flight attendant, because her mother said that being a flight attendant allows her to experience different cultures. At that time, Germany had very high requirements for flight attendants, and you had to master two foreign languages ​​to apply. In her early twenties, Barbara decided to go abroad. Her family contacted a family in Sweden who needed a nanny for her, and she set out alone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Barbara stayed in Sweden for three years and met her future husband, who was also German. Her husband wanted to return to Germany, so Barbara&#39;s dream of being a flight attendant ended. She settled down to become a housewife and raised four children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/iUpQf4uhYGqNGZWs078ZkOGV7cdJHXt16OvID5OU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/iUpQf4uhYGqNGZWs078ZkOGV7cdJHXt16OvID5OU.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251391&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Barbara in her garden&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Children&#39;s words/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Up In the 1970s, Barbara&#39;s family contacted the East German government. After numerous lawsuits, Sister Barbara finally received some compensation. The former manor is now managed by a government foundation. The pastoral scenery and splendor of the past can only be recorded thanks to the photos taken by Barbara’s mother during her lifetime. If no one asked, Barbara rarely told her story to outsiders. She just typed out an &quot;autobiography&quot; of more than thirty pages on a typewriter and left it to her four children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The epic story of nearly a hundred years was condensed into one afternoon&#39;s narration, which I found intoxicating and exciting. I asked Barbara if there was one item that she still regrets leaving in her home at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Barbara spent a few minutes thinking, and I guessed that the answer might be related to gold and silver jewelry. Unexpectedly, she answered: &quot;My little stuffed bear!&quot; She pointed behind her seriously. Said: &quot;So I sewed one for myself!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After hearing this, my friend and I burst into laughter. Barbara explained a little embarrassedly: &quot;I was only a 14-year-old child at the time...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before leaving, Barbara took out a small notebook and asked me to leave a message in it. I wrote in Chinese and Swedish respectively: Dear Barbara, I wish you health and happiness forever. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 24 Sep 2023 20:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[电影《流水落花》：努力将生活这张旧报纸展平]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257533]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-24 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The veteran escort for the Best Actress who has failed nine times finally stepped onto the podium. At the 41st Hong Kong Film Awards, Sammi Cheng, who won the Best Actress Award, couldn&#39;t hide her excitement: &quot;I want to thank God for not letting me have a smooth journey. It is these lack of smooth sailing that have taught me to be humble and gentle... (At this moment) I can’t be gentle. I’m really happy tonight. I finally don’t have to run silently with you on the track, and I can finally cross the finish line with my head held high.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 15, 2023, nearly half a year after winning the award, Sammi Cheng &quot;Flowing Water and Falling Flowers&quot;, the film&#39;s best-selling novel, has finally been released in mainland China. But in the movie, the honors on the awards podium disappear along with the ambition. People saw that Sammi Cheng appeared on the screen without any appearance and almost gave the most &quot;light&quot; performance in her career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/6iHG1ya14BlHIBF5Hl1mIeOOZ3W0uzIhzOHXLmqu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/6iHG1ya14BlHIBF5Hl1mIeOOZ3W0uzIhzOHXLmqu.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251821&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Sammi Cheng (left) in the movie &quot;Falling Water&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The story of &quot;Flowing Water and Falling Flowers&quot; is not complicated. Tianmei, played by Sammi Cheng, was originally a car rider on the school bus. As a caretaker, due to a change in the school bus route, she quit her job and returned home to be a temporary mother in a &quot;foster family&quot;. Together with her husband, Bin, who drove for her boss, she raised the children from social welfare institutions in stages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The children come from different family backgrounds: some have fathers in jail, and some are waiting for adoption due to their own illnesses. Life revolves around children again, and the hidden pain belonging to this family slowly emerges: a few years ago, Tianmei and Bin&#39;s young child died. Being a foster parent is also filling the void of &quot;parent&quot; status. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To some extent, Tianmei, Bin and the passers-by in this family are all &quot;aphasic&quot; in society. When this family decided to become a foster family, they began to encounter scrutiny from the so-called healthy operating system. Every time the social worker asked to come to the door in half an hour, Tianmei felt like she was facing an enemy. According to regulations, one of the couple must stay at home with the child during the parenting period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bed and table should be as tidy as possible, cigarettes are an absolute taboo, and even the smell of cigarettes must be dispersed, which is regarded as a sign of &quot;unhealthy&quot;. But for such a couple who have been silently enduring the shadow of the loss of their child for a long time and living a difficult life, they really can&#39;t imagine a healthier way to resolve it - those moments when they are discouraged, worn out by daily life, and scattered and need to be sorted out. It needs to be dispelled by a silent cigarette. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Movies that focus on people at the bottom of society or on the margins can easily tend to over-emphasize their social side, as if people’s situations have become props to display social problems; the other extreme is an excess of warmth that overwhelms people. The details of getting along too warmly with people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Flowing Water and Falling Flowers&quot; tries its best to stay in the middle ground. It never gives up on capturing tender moments. A foster boy was injured and sent to the hospital for injuries while he was alone at home. The social worker then questioned &quot;Aunt Tianmei&quot; and &quot;Uncle Bin&quot;, and he cleverly excused them - Aunt Tianmei was not at home and had gone to buy medicine for herself. They spent the Spring Festival together, watching the fireworks bloom over the city, and their emotions were intimate and harmonious. But almost the next second, the life of this relationship in the image came to an abrupt end. A new foster child has arrived. There were no ostentatious farewells or overly bitter farewells. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Flowing Water and Falling Flowers&quot; has a vague flavor of Japanese movies. When it needs concentration, it often falls into a sentimental and mournful atmosphere. For example, Tianmei was sitting on the balcony eating cake, letting the rain and wind splash into her territory, leaving water stains on her pants. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She often stood alone on the bridge, waiting for the sunlight to move inch by inch over the narrow water channel, taking away the darkness from her side. &quot;I don&#39;t like to express my feelings with open and wide expressions, but I like to observe things from a detached and cold perspective, so the film may be the same.&quot; Director Jia Shengfeng said in an interview with the media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no narrative ambition in the movie, and some exciting sequences seem to be just making up for the excessive static of life itself. When the mother of a foster boy came to her door feeling out of control, the social worker apologetically told Tianmei that she would immediately help find a new foster family. Tianmei therefore expressed dissatisfaction: He is not a commodity and can be moved around at any time. This is obviously not the first time a similar situation has occurred. The boy had just established trust with them, and they were about to be separated again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/c78u1GrqVdJMyQ3r85w3y4ocTJQqFYq0t5q7onpZ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/c78u1GrqVdJMyQ3r85w3y4ocTJQqFYq0t5q7onpZ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251820&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stills from the movie &quot;Flowing Water and Falling Flowers&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the foster children, Tianmei once considered adopting a girl with cleft lip and palate. But the social worker told her that adoptive families do not have the right to choose their children. According to certain assessment standards, the best adoptive parents for a girl with cleft lip and palate are an American couple, implying that Tianmei and Bin are economically disadvantaged. Tianmei rarely expressed anger: Have you asked your children for their opinions? How to judge the best? At that time, the girl with cleft lip and palate already called Tianmei &quot;mom&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sometimes, turbulent past events emerge suddenly and briefly, such as during bedtime conversations or invitations for intimate behavior. Her husband repeatedly proposed having another child, but Tianmei retorted: What should I do if there is another genetic disease this time? The conversation stopped there, with no further emotion. They accepted the death of their son tacitly, and had no intention of chewing, sorting out, or repeating their grief. Their life is like an old newspaper that is constantly being rubbed by fate. The purpose of living is just to flatten it bit by bit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the title of the film &quot;Falling Flowers in Flowing Water&quot; suggests, foster children are like flowers that have fallen temporarily, and life has temporarily brought them to Tianmei&#39;s family. Some netizens commented: In the first half of the film, the children are like falling flowers and the foster families are like running water. In the second half of the story, the foster family becomes the fallen flower, and the children are the running water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Indeed. Looking at it, after losing their children, Tianmei and Bin&#39;s lives have almost come to a standstill. The life they have been practicing year after year cannot see many changes. When the children arrived, the family just regained some vitality and was full of dynamics - the children&#39;s childhood naughtiness was left in the form of graffiti on the wall. Pencils marked the gradually rising height lines and pasted them on the mirror to teach the children to smile more cheerfully. The flower stickers were put on and then taken off, and a pair of siblings who loved skipping classes wrote on the wall: Jia Xi Jia Lang is here for a visit. These connected graffiti show the flow of time within this family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Flowing Water and Falling Flowers&quot;, there is a scene that illustrates the director&#39;s intention to capture the true form of time - in Tianmei&#39;s imagination and memories, the children who have been in this family stand in rows according to their size.

(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As a charitable organization with strong fundraising capabilities, the China Children’s Charity Aid Foundation (referred to as Children’s Charity Society) has recently fallen into disarray. In the midst of the donation turmoil. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In September 2023, Ke Mouxiao was accused of using the Children&#39;s Charity Society&#39;s &quot;9958 Children&#39;s Emergency Assistance&quot; project (hereinafter referred to as 9958) to defraud families of seriously ill children out of nearly 1,000 yuan. 10,000 life-saving money was detained by the police. The Children&#39;s Charity Association publicly stated that Ke Mouxiao was not its staff and had only served as a volunteer in the Hebei Langfang Team Cooperation Organization of the 9958 Project. But the controversy has not yet died down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Many parents of children who were deceived said that they participated in the &quot;matching donation&quot; initiated by Ke Mouxiao and transferred the funds to Ke Mouxiao. They expected that within a period of time Afterwards, a return higher than the principal amount will be obtained, and the excess will be donated by the enterprise. Because this kind of &quot;matching donation&quot; is a normal operation mode in the charity sector, and families of seriously ill children are accustomed to it, there is no doubt about the authenticity of the project initiated by Ke Mouxiao. (For details, please see Southern Weekly’s report &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/contents/256685?source=131&quot;>;China Children’s Charity Association volunteers are involved in nearly 10 million yuan in aid, and families with serious illness are in trouble again. Matching donation scam&lt;/a>;》)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, the &quot;matching donation&quot; that parents of children with children are accustomed to, is it a arbitrage donation in a gray area? According to relevant laws and policies, it is illegal for charitable organizations to induce parents of children with self-raised funds to participate in matching donations or donate for their own use. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Does the Children&#39;s Charity Association know about such &quot;matching donations&quot;? Southern Weekend reporters discovered that deficiencies in the management and operation of charitable organizations provide a breeding ground for the alienation of matching donations. The more money is raised, the more matching donations are made - with the same goal, the people who need the money most take their money out of their pockets, boosting the charity&#39;s fundraising figures. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Who dares to do it if you can’t get the money back?”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It’s the 99 Charity Day in September every year. Li Shan (pseudonym) from Guangxi I want to raise more life-saving money for my daughter who is suffering from leukemia. He decided to participate in &quot;matching donations.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;99 Charity Day is a national charity event jointly launched by Internet companies and hundreds of charity organizations, enterprises, and celebrities. September 9, 2015 is China&#39;s first Internet Charity Day. In order to arouse the enthusiasm of the whole people to participate in public welfare, the organizers introduced a popular foreign method-matching donations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Matching donation is matching donation. After one donor donates a sum of money to a charity organization, another donor (usually a company) will randomly or according to Donate a certain percentage of money to the same charity organization. The original intention of the matching donation model is to encourage the public to participate in donations. According to its original intention, the donation amount including corporate matching should not be used for the donor himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Charity Law also clearly stipulates that when a donor and a charitable organization agree on the purpose and beneficiaries of donated property, the donor&#39;s interested parties shall not be designated as beneficiaries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But Li Shan has never heard of the above regulations. On the eve of the 99 Charity Day in 2023, Li Shan opened a &quot;Donate Together&quot; charity matching donation project for each of the three charity matching projects launched by the Children&#39;s Charity Society: &quot;Sunflower Protects Children in the West&quot;, &quot;Girls in Need Guarantee Plan&quot; and &quot;Aiding Children in Need to Dream of Going to School&quot;. ” fundraising link and named it after his daughter, who has leukemia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Donate Together&quot; is a charity game launched by Tencent Charity Platform. Users click the corresponding button on the public welfare project homepage and fill in the target amount and sponsor information to generate a link. Donors open the link and enter the amount to donate. Subsequently, this donation information and the corresponding matching donation will be recorded in the initiator&#39;s &quot;Donate Together&quot; and can be publicly queried. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to the public information and implementation plan of the project, the recipients of &quot;Sunflower Guarding Children in the West&quot; are children in need in the western provinces under the age of 18. &quot;Girls in Distress&quot; The &quot;Guarantee Plan&quot; will provide long-term assistance to girls in need across the country, and the goal of &quot;Assisting Children in Need to Dream of Going to School&quot; is to allow children in need to go to school with peace of mind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;I really don&#39;t understand this.&quot; On September 17, 2023, Li Shan listened to a reporter from Southern Weekend introduce the above three projects and said that he neither I don’t know who these projects are aiding, and I don’t know whether my behavior counts as a donation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But before that, in the three days from September 7th to 9th, Li Shan raised more than 210,000 yuan for these three projects through &quot;donate together&quot; , including several &quot;donations&quot; worth 3,000 yuan and 4,000 yuan. According to the rules, Tencent will donate more than 22,000 yuan for this purpose. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Shan explained to Southern Weekend reporters that these &quot;donations&quot; were all his own money. &quot;The people who &#39;donated money&#39; were some relatives and friends. I gave the money to them first and then asked them to donate it to the project.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Shan said frankly , for the more than 200,000 yuan he &quot;donated&quot;, he had no intention of using it to aid children or girls in need in the west. &quot;We are all short of money ourselves.&quot; He believes that the money &quot;donated&quot; and matched by enterprises will eventually come back to him. &quot;Who dares to do it if he can&#39;t get (the money) back?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporters found that during the three days from September 7th to 9th, a total of 12,000 people participated in the above-mentioned activities in the form of &quot;donate together&quot; For the three projects, they &quot;donated&quot; a total of more than 8.86 million yuan. Each &quot;donate together&quot; raised an average of 45,900 yuan, and the largest single &quot;donation&quot; was 10,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/9658c1749b.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/9658c1749b.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251851&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A &quot;Donate Together&quot; link initiated by a parent of a seriously ill child for the project of &quot;Aiding Children in Distress to Dream of Going to School&quot;.

Li Shan began to form this understanding in 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, he was hospitalized in Dongguan with his daughter. In order to seek medical treatment for his daughter, who has not yet entered elementary school, he claimed to have spent at least 700,000 yuan in two years. He remembers that day, the patient next to him took out 2,000 yuan and asked him to &quot;donate&quot; the link he had opened for him, and at the same time help answer the questions (according to the rules of the platform, those who answer the questions will have a chance to get more matching donations). The patient told him that after doing so, the platform would randomly match an undetermined amount of matching donation, and &quot;after certain procedures,&quot; the patient would not only get the matching donation, but &quot;the principal can also be returned.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the eve of 99 Charity Day in 2023, Li Shan joined a &quot;matching donation group&quot;. He said that the organizer of the group is a staff member of the 9958 Tai&#39;an team, and the group members call him &quot;teacher&quot;. Southern Weekend reporters were unable to confirm whether the organizer was an official staff member of the Children&#39;s Charity Society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Tencent Foundation has provided a matching donation of 299.99 million yuan for all charity projects participating in the 2023 99 Charity Day activities. According to the matching donation rules announced by the platform, starting from 10:00 am on September 7th to 9th, every user donation greater than 1 yuan may receive a random amount of matching donation. The daily matching donation amount is on a first-come, first-served basis while supplies last. Together with the funds donated by donors, it will be transferred to the donated charity projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But Li Shan’s understanding of “matching donation” is obviously different. &quot;He (the group organizer) told us when to start investing, and then we started donating money.&quot; Li Shan recalled that through mutual communication among patients in the group, he learned that as long as he launched the &quot;Donate Together&quot; fundraising link in the designated project , find someone to donate money and help answer questions, the &quot;teacher&quot; can apply for a &quot;matching donation&quot; for him, and the principal can be returned through &quot;relevant procedures&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Before the start of the 99 Charity Day, the &quot;teacher&quot; announced the &quot;quota&quot; in the group, and he signed up in the group; after signing up, he sent it to his relatives and friends Transfer money; at 10 o&#39;clock on the day of the event, while there is still a matching donation quota, you must &quot;raise it yourself as soon as possible, otherwise you will not be able to vote later and the link is full&quot;; after the event is over, wait for the refund. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Within three days, Li Shan &quot;donated&quot; more than 200,000 yuan to three projects initiated by the Children&#39;s Charity Association. &quot;No parent asked why he donated to these projects. &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Public information of the project shows that a total of 54 people initiated &quot;Donate Together&quot; within three days of &quot;Assisting Children in Distress to Dream of Going to School.&quot; Two years after the project was launched, it has completed its fundraising goal and raised 4.35 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As of press time, &quot;Sunflower Protects Children in the West&quot; has reached the public fundraising goal of 5 million yuan. In addition to Li Shan, 102 people have launched the &quot;Donate Together&quot; &quot;. 78 people participated in the &quot;Donate Together&quot; program of the &quot;Girls in Distress Protection Plan&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/5944ffaa94.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/5944ffaa94.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251852&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Sunflower Protects Children in the West&quot; has reached its public fundraising goal of 5 million yuan. (Internet screenshot/picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It can be seen from public information on the Internet that during the 99 Charity Day, most of the link names of &quot;Donate Together&quot; are named after children. Naming; often multiple accounts repeatedly &quot;donate money&quot; to a link, with a single amount reaching a thousand yuan; multiple names appear in different projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;以孩子的名字命名筹款链接，据称是为了方便后期返款。曾在9958某地方团队工作过的王强（化名）说，99公益日结束后，家长们会把用孩子名字命名的“一起捐”截图发给9958地方分中心的财务人员，由财务人员统计每位家长实际投了多少钱。 “一起捐”的页面会分别显示家长自筹的资金和平台配捐的金额。自筹部分会在99公益日结束后返给家长，“这是儿慈会账上的钱”，配捐的部分要等到平台将配捐资金打到儿慈会后，“再通过各地的民非组织或其他途径返给家长”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;王强还向南方周末记者解释，拨付配捐金额时，家长需要向工作人员提供与基金会总拨款金额相一致的发票，“比如本金5万，配捐2万，家长就要提供面值7万的发票给基金会，不然账目做不平”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“患儿家长提供的发票内容要与孩子的病情相关，住院发票、门诊发票或外购药发票都可以。”王强进一步提到。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;9月17日，李山称还未拿到返款。柯某孝事件曝光后，他担心自己投出去的钱回不来。 “（工作人员）也没有说什么时候会把钱给我们，出事前说我们把小孩的资料提交过去，就等基金会（儿慈会）给我们回款，但现在这样我们也很慌。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;据南方都市报，曾有此前成功获得“配捐”的家长出示过银行汇款单，付款人为儿慈会。但儿慈会平台传播部主任孙丹丹称，一些家长收到来自儿慈会的款项，并非是因为“配捐”，可能是因为符合9958项目的救助标准，并且地方团队或救助站提交了患儿的信息和情况，评估后符合救助标准，则按照救助流程发放救助款。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;腾讯公益在9月13日通报称，柯某孝的行为虽未发生在腾讯公益平台，但基于平台运营规则、行业自律公约及以用户为本的原则，做出以下决定：对9958所有项目暂停筹款，等待官方调查结果。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“团队号召家长大额捐赠”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;儿慈会对于李山这样的“配捐”是否知情？南方周末记者获得的一份微信群交流记录显示，正是在工作人员及志愿者的号召下，不少大病患儿家长积极参与了2023年99公益日的所谓“配捐”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这个群名为“儿慈会项目四部全国分中心核心人员”，人数最多时有七十余人，群主王昱，这一名字正是儿慈会副秘书长、紧急救助部9958救助中心主任。儿慈会2022年年报显示的9958项目工作人员几乎都在群中，此外还有9958各地方团队的“负责人”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;紧急救助部又称项目四部，据儿慈会官网介绍，其下设立9958儿童紧急救助中心。儿慈会2022年年报显示，紧急救助部9958救助中心拥有16名工作人员，是儿慈会人数最多的部门。其下的9958儿童紧急救助项目于2012年成立，系儿慈会的自主品牌项目。这些年来，这个项目在全国搭建了渭南、河南、山西、泰安、石家庄等救助分中心25家。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023年8月以来，群昵称显示为“9958-曹丽芳”的工作人员在群里频繁分享与99公益日相关的信息和提醒。据微信公众号“9958儿童紧急救助”和儿慈会2022年年报，曹丽芳是儿慈会项目四部主任，还担任9958救助中心的主管。 99公益日期间，亦是9958项目的统筹。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;8月23日，曹丽芳在群里通知“平台在进行配捐测试”，请工作人员对参与项目进行小额捐赠，体验活动流程。 “不建议让家长参与测试，无法确定家长投入的金额，会占用项目剩余的筹款空间的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;8月29日，她又提醒，“参与患儿注意病种是否与项目相符合，如果未明确病种，项目按照全病种处理，如果项目明确了例如孤独症、早产儿、先心病，请团队在家长选择上对应相应病种，如项目为女童字眼，请团队把关男童不要使用。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2天后，她给大家分享了对99公益日的配捐规则的理解，如需要好友助力答题“是否答对都有机会获得配捐”，家长可以照着儿慈会的培训资料学习提升公益身份等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“团队可以直接号召家长大额捐赠，7号当天要完成80%的捐赠。”曹丽芳在群里说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;一位曾经在9958工作过的公益人士向南方周末记者解释，99公益日当天，许多患儿家长会往多个项目里投钱，平台很大概率会给捐款金额最多的项目配捐最多的资金，“一个好友一天只能给同一个大病患儿家长助力一次，大额捐赠得到最多的配捐”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;9月4日，曹丽芳又在群里通知所有人：“参与99公益的家长，提前给亲朋好友转账。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;9月7日配捐开始前，群昵称显示为“9958平台发展部-许嘉雯”的人（年报显示这一名字职务为“9958救助中心项目官员”）在群里通知，“公益捐赠是自愿无偿的行为，请做好动员规范管理，共同守护行业公信力。”但半个多小时后，群昵称显示为“9958平台发展部贾珍”的人又说，“高配的让家长赶紧冲。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;上述公益人解释，“高配”指的是平台当天的配捐比例比较高，“赶紧冲”是因为配捐开始后，越到后边配捐的金额就会越少，直到当天的配捐额度全部用完。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;9月7日19时左右，“9958平台发展部-许嘉雯”在群里发布统计结果，当天项目四部筹了8244余万元，获得配捐561万余元。石家庄团队共筹了2964余万元（含182万元配捐），在17个地方团队中排名第一；泰安团队共筹了1951万元（含116万元配捐），排名第二。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;9月23日，南方周末记者拨打了曹丽芳和贾珍预留在公共平台的手机号，均无人接听。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/6e635b278e.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;公开财报显示，有7.14亿元的捐赠在2022年流入儿慈会；这一数字，在2021年是8.38亿元，在2020年是8.34亿元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;其中，9958作为儿慈会的明星项目，在过去三年间的收入分别为3.22亿元（2020）、2.62亿元（2021）和2.27亿元（2022），约占儿慈会年总收入的三分之一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;不过，公开数据没有显示，儿慈会每年的筹款中，有多少属于严格意义上的公众捐赠，有多少是为了得到配捐的自捐自用。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023年腾讯公益规定，99公益日中，募捐机构可以将所得配捐的20%用于组织的运营和发展。这意味着，机构筹款额越高，获得平台配捐越多，最终得到的激励也就越多。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;此外，配捐之外的时间段，每个募捐机构最多还能得到200万元的非限定性捐款作为激励金。这部分激励金先到先得，机构可以不将它用于项目执行。 9月7日15时30分许，许嘉雯在群里通知大家：“后台非配奖励已达200w（万），不再获得新激励。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此次配捐风波中，儿慈会声明，从未委托过柯某孝个人为9958项目募集资金，柯某孝并非该会工作人员，而是9958廊坊团队合作机构的志愿者。但王强和上述公益人都表示，这样的人员合作机制在儿慈会普遍存在，不少以“9958工作人员”名义组织筹款的人，都不是儿慈会正式工作人员，但他们在筹款时拥有较大权限，也背负筹款压力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王强告诉南方周末记者，自己进入9958某地方团队任工作人员后，没有与儿慈会或者该地9958救助中心签订劳动或劳务合同。他说他平时的工资由当地的民非组织或企业发放，周围的同事也是这样的情况。某种意义上，王强的身份和柯某孝一样，也是“志愿者”，但在对外宣传中，他被称为9958某地团队的运营专员。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但王强也难以算做严格意义上的志愿者。按照《志愿服务条例》，志愿服务应遵循无偿原则。曾有法律学者提出，给患者筹款、收取执行费的行为更像外国慈善救济中常见的专业筹款人，只是国内现行筹款制度不完善，各方才把这一群体称为“志愿者”。 （详见南方周末报道《&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/contents/203083&quot;>;“筹款志愿者”的“配捐”疑云&lt;/a>;》）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在9958工作的几年间，王强觉得自己“像搞业务一样”。如果只做本职工作，每月收入不会超过4000元，若要更高收入，就需要找到更多大病患儿家庭，以“志愿者”的身份帮助他们在几个互联网平台公开筹款。王强将上筹款链接形容为“上项目”，自称可拿到筹款总额3%甚至更高的执行费，但其未出示转款凭证。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与无特定受益人的公众捐赠相比，大病患儿家长有更强的募捐动力，能够帮助“志愿者”更快达成筹款目标。事实上，柯某孝本人可能也是大病患儿家长，互联网上可查询到他2021年为患血癌的孩子筹款的信息，和他作为收款人、某慈善组织作为付款人的银行出账回单。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“有的家长很可怜，为了上筹款项目都会跪下来求你。”王强说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;甚至不同团队间也会对着抢“生意”。前述在9958工作过的公益人告诉南方周末记者，他此前在一家肿瘤专科医院对接一位大病患儿，已经收集了患儿资料，准备第二天给患儿拍照、写筹款文案、上传网络，“结果第二天家长不让我去拍了，还问我要走了之前（同意机构）公开使用孩子照片的授权书。后来才知道是其他团队的人把这个孩子抢走了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;9958内部也会进行团队筹款排名。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023年8月20日，群昵称显示为“9958新媒体~孙硕”的人（年报显示这一名字职位为“9958救助中心项目官员”）在工作群发布了8月11日-8月18日各地团队在快手平台做项目筹款金额时的排名：北京团队筹款5.1万元，贵阳团队筹款5320元，安徽团队筹款3326元，兰州团队筹款1912元，泰安团队筹款801元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“和其他团队老师还差的（得）有点远。”群昵称为“泰安团队蒙蒙”的人在群里说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;9月9日，2023年的99公益日即将结束。许嘉雯在群里通报了9958项目三天来的数据：三日获得总筹款超1.34亿元，获得总配捐超1181万元。她还附上各地方团队总筹款由高到低的排名图：石家庄团队排名第一，筹款超3640万元；泰安团队排名第二，筹款超2804万元；渭南团队排名第三，筹款超2736万元；山西团队排名第四，筹款超2074万元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“感谢活动期间各位老师们的努力，老师们辛苦啦。”许嘉雯在群里说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;南方周末记者未能从公开途径查询到9958设立的地方团队名单，但根据上述聊天记录，至少有石家庄、泰安、山西、广东、上海、渭南、青岛、兰州、保定等17个团队。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;模糊的信息公开&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;儿慈会从9958诸多项目中筹得的资金如何使用，按规定需要公开，但公开程度不一。 2020年女大学生吴花燕之死，就曾让9958陷入信息公开程度不够、超龄救助的争议。 （详见南方周末报道《&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/contents/174760?source=131&quot;>;“吴花燕之死”引发公益人士反思&lt;/a>;》）&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;模糊的项目信息公开，为捐赠和配捐资金回到李山们手中创造了便利。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;以李山参与的项目为例。李山在9958泰安团队的组织下“捐”的三个项目中，“向阳花守护西部儿童”“困境女童保障计划”尚未进入执行披露期，“援助困境儿童上学梦”（简称“上学梦”）立项已近两年，目前披露了项目进展、财务等数方面内容。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;公益项目的信息公开与其本身的帮扶范围有关，如医疗救助类项目应公开受助者的名单和病种，医疗机构的信息以及救助标准。但“上学梦”现有公开信息与它本身的帮扶目的存在矛盾之处。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;其项目介绍称，“捐赠10元，能够支持一名孩子买上一份学习用具。捐赠50元，能够支持一名孩子部分生活费”。但其2022年的财务披露明细表写明，给受助者拨付的206万余元，全部为受助者的医疗补贴，且未公布相应的生活补贴。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“助学项目给的是学费，财务上通常会记作&#39;生活补贴&#39;，除非救助的小朋友要同步做医疗救治。”恩友财务联合创始人周早英感觉自己难以理解这份明细表出现的问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“上学梦”在腾讯公益平台公开了2022年的财务支出发票，6月、10月和12月，儿慈会给泰安市圆梦公益事业发展中心（简称泰安圆梦）分别拨付了339万元、163万元、27万元，并注明有近129.2万元来自“上学梦”项目。儿慈会2022年审计报告也显示，泰安圆梦作为“大额支付对象”，接收了中华儿慈会一笔128.7万元的救助活动费。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;但“上学梦”公开介绍的执行方是9958北京向阳组救助中心，南方周末记者并未发现泰安圆梦与之存在公开业务关联。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;儿慈会拨给泰安圆梦的发票信息显示，泰安圆梦的复核人与收款人都是李蒙蒙。根据泰安圆梦2022年年报，李蒙蒙是机构的理事长，游国保是行政负责人。按9958微信公众号发布的内容，上述二人同时也是9958泰安团队的主任。南方周末记者还发现，李蒙蒙的微信昵称、头像与上述儿慈会工作群中“泰安团队蒙蒙”的一致。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;9月23日，南方周末记者拨通了李蒙蒙的电话，对方称不接受采访，拒绝透露这笔拨款具体的性质和去向。南方周末记者拨打了儿慈会平台部、传播部和儿童紧急救助的热线电话，均无法接通。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“李蒙蒙作为9958泰安团队的主任募集了资金，同时也作为泰安圆梦的法人代表执行这个项目，从乐观的角度说，&#39;上学梦&#39;是一个全国性的公益项目，她如果熟悉泰安的情况，在当地可以执行得更高效。”周早英说。但从悲观的角度来看，“项目不够公开、难以解释的信息，可能导致公众对公益行业的信任危机”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/7a90c82ab7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;665&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/7a90c82ab7.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“捐赠必须是自愿、无偿的，如果家长以返还捐款、获取配捐资金为前提，往公益项目里投钱，就连捐赠都算不上。”上海复恩社会组织法律研究与服务中心理事长陆璇向南方周末记者解释。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;有观点认为，一些大病患儿家长也是需要公益救助的对象，以自捐自用的方式套取配捐资金无可厚非。但陆璇不这样看。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“非常恶劣。”陆璇分析，慈善组织的公益性决定它的使命宗旨是要帮助社会中不特定的对象。项目工作人员如果鼓励大病患儿家长往项目里捐钱才安排拨款，就成了帮助“特定对象”，除了构成违反诚实信用原则的套捐行为之外，也违背了一个慈善组织的公益性，不符合慈善法规定的项目受益人选择应遵循的“公开、公平、公正”原则。这可能让更需要救助的困难人群得不到救助资金，也让慈善组织的整体社会评价受到贬损。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;北京师范大学法学院副教授马剑银同样不认为“先往公益项目投钱，再从基金会拿钱”的行为属于捐赠。 “这是为了套取配捐而进行的虚假捐赠，如果证据链完整，就是一种&#39;骗捐&#39;。”马剑银分析，这个行为中被骗者是拿出资金来进行配捐的主体，“他们可以向组织方追究责任，也可以向民政部门举报。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;需要找公益机构求助的大病患儿家长往往收入有限，也不具备强有力的社会关系，可能是社会中的弱势群体。一位研究社会组织的法律专家向南方周末记者分析，这一群体如果得知可以通过机构做“套捐”，会有非常强的参与动力，“因为会觉得自己是受益人”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;但这种行为会伤害更多潜在的、同样需要帮扶的对象，让其他困难群体得不到本可能属于他们的公众支持。另外，也会使资源本就匮乏的公益机构难以发展。业内普遍呼吁，慈善募捐应该坚持募、用分离。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023年9月4日，曹丽芳曾把一份名为《儿慈会99公益日自律公约》的文件发到上述工作群中，并要求各团队负责人签字、按手印。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;这份自律公约第七条写道，“杜绝任何形式的套取配捐行为”。如有违反，“将承担因此产生的所有责任及后果，接受中华儿慈会对此的一切处理”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“发了内部规定，机构就没有管理责任了吗？”陆璇分析，即便各地团队的工作人员与9958不存在直接的劳动或者劳务关系，但这些人实际上已经为9958提供了服务。通过机构间的资金往来，可证明几个主体之间存在一定的合同关系。 “如果9958的地方团队犯了错，到头来只是让地方团队自己承担责任，说不过去。”&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;前一天，一架F-35B“闪电”II型联合攻击战斗机在例行演练中突发事故，飞行员在紧急情况下选择弹射逃生。此后，该战机以“僵尸状态”继续飞行，并在南卡罗来纳州上空失联。为了找回失踪的F-35B战机，美国多军种和多部门联合出动，并在社交媒体上发布“寻机启事”，向民众公开征集线索。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一起大规模寻找战机的离奇事件在网上引发热议，不少人觉得不可思议。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南卡罗来纳州联邦众议员南希·梅斯在社交媒体质问：“怎么搞的，你们怎么弄丢一架F-35？为什么会没有追踪设备？还得请求民众帮忙找到战机并上交？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“空军训练基地一般建立在城市郊区，雷达部署不可能面面俱到，当飞机失速后处于较低飞行高度时，雷达探测不到目标并不罕见。更何况F-35B战斗机具有出色的隐身功能，其雷达反射面积极小。”前海军军官王群怀告诉南方周末记者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实上，战斗机在无人状态下自行飞走并不是没有先例，曾有战机在脱离驾驶员掌控后长途飞行近千公里，直到燃料用尽后在异国坠毁。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“战机去哪儿了”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“如果你有任何可以帮助我们找到F-35战机的线索，请致电基地防御行动中心。”当地时间2023年9月18日，美国查尔斯顿联合基地在社交平台上发布了一则“寻机启事”，引发舆论关注。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;失踪的战斗机隶属于美国海军陆战队第二航空联队第501战斗机攻击训练中队，该中队主要负责飞行员训练。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;9月17日下午，一名美军飞行员驾驶F-35B“闪电”Ⅱ型战斗机，从查尔斯顿联合基地起飞，执行训练任务。但不久后，战机突然出现意外事故，飞行员在生死关头选择弹射逃生。下午2时左右，该飞行员在被查尔斯顿社区安全落地，随后被送往医院，但其所驾驶的F-35B却下落不明。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;查尔斯顿联合基地一名发言人告诉美国全国广播公司，飞行员弹射跳伞后，战机处于自动驾驶模式，使得追踪变得更加复杂。法新社报道称，该战机将以所谓“僵尸状态”继续飞行，直至坠落。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;值得注意的是，事发时另有一架F-35战机伴随飞行。但飞行员并未继续跟踪无人驾驶飞机的踪迹，而是选择返回基地。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;战机失联后，美国军方迅速联合海军陆战队、海军以及美国联邦航空局、民用空中巡逻队和南卡罗来纳州当地执法部门，围绕北查尔斯顿市以北的莫尔特里湖和马里恩湖一带，从空中和地面展开立体搜索。 9月18日傍晚时分，数架搜寻飞机在威廉斯堡县斯塔基镇附近一片树林和农田地区盘旋。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一天一夜的搜寻过后，美国海军陆战队发言人证实，在威廉斯堡县一片田野中找到了F-35B战机残骸。坠机地点距离查尔斯顿联合基地约129公里。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“F-35B兼具隐身、短距起飞、垂直降落等诸多优点，具有高水平的通用性和互操作性，是世界上最先进、最受欢迎的战斗机之一。”英国知名防务媒体网站“谢泼德传媒”评价称。但就是这样一款被誉为“未来空战主力杀手”的先进战机，却在美国掀起了一场“战机去哪儿了”的网络群嘲。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美国广播公司新闻撰稿人、退休上校史蒂夫·甘亚德吐槽说，“尽管它是一架隐形飞机，但如此昂贵、如此复杂的飞机竟然会消失，这确实很荒谬。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“雷达捕获隐身战机其实并没有人们想象中那么容易。”王群怀指出，一方面，对空警戒雷达仰角偏高，发射的电磁波基本上是直线传播，战机要飞到足够高度才能被有效识别；另一方面，F-35B战机最高飞行速度最高可达每小时上千公里，几分钟就可以飞行上百公里，一旦应答器失去作用，雷达基本上看不见，就只能靠肉眼搜索。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;F-35战机加装有龙勃透镜，王群怀表示，这就是为了故意增大反射信号，在降落时便于被空管雷达发现，“当然在需要隐身飞行时，龙勃透镜会被收起”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;目前，美国军方将该事故认定为严重等级最高的A级事故，但并未透露涉事飞行员的名字，也没有公布事故发生的原因。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其实，这不是F35-B战机第一次发生A级事故。四个月前，驻日美军一架F-35B战斗机在飞行训练中发生零部件脱落，该战机随后返回岩国基地。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;米格-23横穿欧洲&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;先进战机的离奇失踪让人诧异，但这并不是史上头一遭。三十多年前米格-23战机的“僵尸飞行”经历，比F-35B更为传奇。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1989年，横亘在东、西德之间的柏林墙仍然高高伫立，以美国为首的北大西洋公约组织和以苏联为首的华沙条约组织在欧洲紧张对峙。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据公开记载，7月4日早晨，刚刚结束休假的尼古拉·斯库里丁上校像往常一样坐上米格-23战斗机，从波兰科沃布热格附近的巴吉兹空军基地起飞。对于这位驾驶经验丰富的飞行员而言，这不过是极为寻常的一次飞行训练，没想到这一天会被载入世界航空史。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当斯库里丁驾驶飞机爬升至150米高度时，他突然发现发动机加力燃烧室推力骤减，意识到飞机开始下坠的斯库里丁立即向地面指挥中心报告了发动机故障问题。在接到塔台弃机跳伞的指令后，他果断按下紧急抛盖按钮，米格-23战斗机座舱盖脱离机身，斯库里丁被安全弹射出座舱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但出人意料的是，这架无人驾驶的米格-23战斗机并未如预想中那样葬身波罗的海，反而在弹射作用下突然抬起头向上爬升，并很快恢复了正常飞行姿态，从波兰北部上空向西飞去，并横跨当时的民主德国（东德）。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管驻扎在波兰境内的防空雷达识别出了该战机，但误以为是常规训练，其飞行轨迹并未受到干扰。不到半个小时，米格-23战斗机进入联邦德国（西德）境内，被北约部署在汉堡的警戒雷达发现。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;北约军事指挥部在收到警报后，紧急出动驻扎在荷兰境内的两架美国F-15战斗机进行拦截。与美国战机的严阵以待相比，这架米格-23战斗机没有做出任何规避动作，保持着既有速度平稳飞行。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当已做好空战准备的美国飞行员逼近米格-23战斗机时，他们发现该战机没有座舱盖，也没有飞行员，更没有携带弹药。于是，北约军事指挥部解除拦截指令，命令两架F-15战机尾随米格-23战机。随后，米格-23战机一路西行飞跃荷兰领空，并进入比利时。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当地时间上午10时30分，在距离比利时首都80公里处，油料耗尽的米格-23战斗机坠落在比利时西部科特赖克贝勒海姆镇一所民宅，在家中睡觉的19岁少年维姆·德拉尔不幸遇难。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而此时，苏联正在波罗的海寻找米格-23战斗机的残骸。直到看到西方媒体的报道，苏联才知晓自己的战机在无人驾驶状态下继续飞行了79分钟，跋涉逾900公里，横穿波兰、民主德国、联邦德国、荷兰以及比利时五国，最终在比利时坠毁。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;7月6日，比利时就飞机坠毁事件向苏联提出抗议。最终，苏联向比利时支付了约62.5万欧元的赔偿金，其中大部分补偿给德拉尔的家人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;玉米田轰炸机&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”绝地逢&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;生&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;美国俄亥俄州代顿市是飞机发明者莱特兄弟的故乡，这里有着世界上历史最悠久、规模最大的军事航空博物馆——美国空军博物馆。据官网介绍，该博物馆收藏着自一战以来的约400架航空航天飞行器。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在美国空军博物馆展出的各类飞机中，其中一架采用大三角翼设计、机身呈蜂腰型的F-106战斗机似乎并不显眼。但其劫后余生的传奇经历，被一代又一代的美国飞行员口口相传，他们将其视为幸运战机，并亲昵地称它为“玉米田轰炸机”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1970年2月2日，飞行员加里·福斯特中尉驾驶着这架尾号为580787的F-106战斗机腾空而起。与此同时，另有3架F-106伴随起飞。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是发生在美国蒙大拿州马尔姆斯特罗姆空军基地的一次例行战术对抗训练。按照原计划，福斯特中尉将和其中一名飞行员组成一队，和另外两架F-106战机展开对等空战演练。不过，由于其中一架飞机阻力伞出现问题，原定的双机对抗项目变成了一场“一对二”的“战斗”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但当福斯特中尉驾驶F-106战斗机快速升至万米高空时，战斗机突然失速陷入极其危险的水平旋转状态，随后急速下降至约3657米高度。福斯特多次尝试旋转恢复程序，但均未成功，随后将自己弹射出飞机驾驶舱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由于飞行员弹射后导致战机重量减轻，重心发生变化，再加上座椅冲出飞机的爆炸力将飞机的机头向下推，F-106战斗机摆脱了旋转，在无人控制的情况下进入稳定滑翔状态，以每小时三百多公里的速度平稳直线飞行。而这正好是F-106战机正常状态下进行着陆的进近速度。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;挂在降落伞上的福斯特只能眼睁睁看着自己的座机越飞越远。随后，他降落在附近山区里，被当地居民&lt;span>;用雪地摩托&lt;/span>;救了出来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而他所驾驶的F-106战斗机则在飞行一段距离后，安全着陆在蒙大拿州大桑迪附近的一片玉米田，它甚至在滑行过程中完美绕开了田地中央的岩石堆。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当地警方赶到降落点时，飞机发动机仍在正常运转，雷达还保持扫射状态。一小时四十五分钟后，F-106战斗机燃料耗尽，发动机自动熄火。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随后，加利福尼亚州麦克莱伦空军基地后勤中心的技术人员抵达现场，他们惊讶地发现除了机腹几米长的擦伤外，整个战机受损程度很小。一名救援官员甚至表示，如果损坏程度再轻一点，他就会直接驾驶该战机返回基地。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在王群怀看来，有人战机在无人操控的情况下自行降落是万中无一的事，基本很难实现。 “飞机降落是飞行中最危险的环节之一，需要通过减速和下降来保持合适的速度和高度，还要调整机身姿态和推力来适应跑道位置和气流情况，任何一个环节出现问题，都可能对飞机降落造成威胁。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过“战争历史在线”网站称，地面上厚厚的积雪为战机轻盈着陆提供了缓冲。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;F-106战机被运回加利福尼亚州后，空军工作人员对其进行修复，该战机后续又重新投入使用。 1979年，福斯特再次驾驶这架战机飞上蓝天，在佛罗里达州廷德尔空军基地参与训练。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1986年8月，这架编号为580787的F-106战机退役，随后被捐赠给美国空军博物馆。几年后，F-106战机全部从美国军队退役，并于21世纪初彻底告别历史舞台。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;视频一开始是两段话的剪接。第一段是他16岁时对父母的喊话：“本来最希望我留在北京的是你们，你们应该为此（买房）努力”。第二段是他现在说“生活上我已经很满足了，也没有什么欲望。如果我真需要什么的话，给我爸打个电话就好了，他们还欠着我一套北京的房子，到现在也该值一千多万了，（记者：他们愿意给你吗？）不愿意又怎么样，不愿意也得愿意”，然后露齿而笑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;剪接的意图有些明显。果不其然，看了之后许多人对张炘炀的言论与价值观大加挞伐。随着讨论深入，越来越多的人发现事情有很多的秘辛，对他则多了一份同情与扼腕长叹。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在采访中，记者问他是不是神童，他说不是，显得很谦虚。不过，记者问他智商是什么样子的，跟韦神、柳智宇比如何，他说140左右，“应该是同一水平，比他们稍稍低一点”，对自己的智力还是非常自信的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张炘炀究竟是不是神童？我认为是的。他从小就显示出了过人的智力天赋，随后不断跳级，10岁就考上了大学，但考分只能上二本。而他的父亲似乎有一个执念，太希望证明儿子是神童，太希望儿子维持神童的人设，居然不同意他复读以上一个985大学，似乎晚一年上大学，这神童的光彩就暗淡了、这人设就保不住了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;记者问“假如你不是这么小就考大学，你有没有可能考到清华北大”，他答“可能性不大，恰恰是因为按照我这个智力，就即使在一个理想状态下，大概率也就是一个985高校”。这个回答非常谦虚。他如果晚几年等到心智更成熟时再高考，考上清华北大应是可能的或者去中科大少年班也是很好的选择。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先，这样才可以让自己的知识体系更完备、更扎实，才有可能考得更好。其次，智商高，在知识上可以较同龄人高出一大截，但对世事与人性的理解及社会化生存技能一般没法提前习得，只能随着年龄增长逐步增进，这不仅对人际关系与个人心理健康至关重要，对高考来说也并非无关因素。比如高考作文要写好得有这方面的体悟，10岁的孩子智商再高，社会化程度与跟其他18岁的同学没法比，很难写出高分作文。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张炘炀，10岁读大学，上的天津工程师范学院；13岁读硕士，上的是北京工业大学；16岁读博士，上的是北京航空航天大学。本科学校挺负责任，对他着重培养，导师帮他联系德国学校读研，“他们可能对天才的培养要比我们更好一些”，因为德国学校规定14岁才能独自上学，“我们就劝他父亲（等一年）”，但似乎在他父亲看来，等一年会导致神童失格，坚持要让他大三后直接读研。试想，要是张炘炀14岁时去了德国，人生道路会完全不一样。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;之后要求父母买房+16岁读博士在2011年闹得沸沸扬扬，他父亲要求他毕业后留在北京，所以他反要求父母买房，“本来最希望我留在北京的是你们，你们应该为此（买房）努力”让舆论哗然，大家觉得一个天才思想境界怎么这么低呢。说出这话，反映张炘炀对世情人性的理解不及他的智力。提出反要求，其实是他对父亲过度操控他人生的一种反叛。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;自此以后，对父亲作为的反弹、反叛与反噬一发不可收拾，8年才读完了博士。如果他有足够动机的话，恐怕早就读完了。对父亲的怨恨及心态上的放弃与躺平，令他失去了上进的动机，这是张炘炀本人的悲剧，也是一个家庭的悲剧。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现在，张炘炀这样说：“12年前我热衷北京的户口房子，现在完全反过来了，就是我完全没有买房的想法了，无业无房无贷一身轻不好吗？你以为房本上的名字是你的，这房子就真的是你的家吗？”躺平与激愤的心态一览无余。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他在采访中控诉父亲对他的极度控制，并表达将来如何培养自己的孩子：“我轻易不要孩子，一旦决定要了，一辈子资助到底，只要不违反国家法律，他愿意做什么就做什么，他如果强烈表现出我当时的表现，那我也会让他走这条路的。”这与其说是展望未来，倒不如说是对他父亲的控诉，及对心目中理想父亲的画像。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张炘炀的博导张耀辉曾说过：张炘炀确实是他学生里面成绩最好的一个，但是他的升学太快了，导致他的心智和心理都不是太成熟，如果他可以定下心来做学问，在某一个领域肯下苦功，那么将来肯定会有很大的成就。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张耀辉觉得张炘炀受到了太多挫折，很是怜悯，并给出一个忠告：“这个年纪不能再犹豫了，该干啥要决断。如果不干別的，就把（数学）这个大问题解决了。假如江郎才尽，那可以去做生意，说不定也能闯出片天来，千万不要躺平。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;问题是，张炘炀超高的智商仍在，但那股心劲儿不见了。人是意义的动物，没有精气神，就好比失去灵魂。希望张炘炀能放下过往的一切不堪，找回自己的存在意义，重新激发出强劲的动机来，有所作为，不枉费自己的天赋。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同时也希望天下的父母给孩子自由成长的空间，怵惕那种病态的控制心。孩子是天才也好，众人也好，每一个孩子都有他来到这个世界的意义，别过度干预与操控。唯有如此，孩子的人格与灵魂才不会受到伤害，才会焕发出应有的美丽光环。 &lt;/p>;

In the Han Dynasty, they were only tomb temples. From the Wei and Jin Dynasties to the Sui and Tang Dynasties, family ancestral halls appeared in the Song Dynasty, and after the Yuan Dynasty, ancestral halls for worshiping ancestors appeared. Ancestral halls are common throughout our country. As temples of blood worship, they have a long history and an indelible status. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>; Deeply influenced by Chinese traditional culture, there is also an obvious clan tradition in the Chaoshan area. Throughout the ages, Chaoshan people have built a large number of ancestral halls, which is the Chaoshan people&#39;s &quot;return to the original&quot; heart.

The genealogy and family history carried in the ancestral halls are closely related to the Chaoshan ethnic groups.

When worshiping, Chaoshan people use it to place offerings and incense candles, and when doing happy events, it becomes a dining table. The Eight Immortals Table often appears in Chaoshan weddings, gardening, giving birth to boys and other happy events. The Eight Immortals table placed in the Chaoshan ancestral hall is mainly used to place sacrifices. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;The project party urgently apologized&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Faced with the strong anger caused by the promotional photos&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;CIQICHINA, the party concerned, responded&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 21, the organizer of the project issued an apology statement on the Internet, apologizing The statement mentioned: All published content has been deleted and content rectification and reflection are being carried out.

For children, childhood without snacks is bleak, and for adults, life without snacks is incomplete. Simply put, snacks are all foods other than meals. On September 15, 2023, a study published in the &quot;European Journal of Nutrition&quot; pointed out that unhealthy snacks are counteracting the effect of healthy meals, thereby increasing the risk of obesity, stroke, cardiovascular and other diseases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A research team from King&#39;s College London in the UK studied the snacking habits of 854 people and came to two-quarter conclusions. A quarter of people&#39;s daily energy intake comes from snacks, but a quarter of people offset the benefits of a healthy meal with unhealthy snacks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Overall, the UK is a country that loves snacking, with 24% of people’s daily energy intake coming from snacks such as cereal bars, pastries and fruits. Snack eaters (95%) eat an average of 2.28 snacks per day, of which 47% eat two snacks per day and 29% eat more than two snacks per day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A quarter (26%) of those who took part in the study reported eating healthy meals but poor quality snacks such as biscuits, crisps and cakes. Just cancel out their healthy meal. The so-called healthy meals refer to foods recommended according to dietary guidelines, such as a balanced diet based on cereals. The daily meal should include cereals and potatoes, vegetables and fruits, livestock, poultry, fish, eggs, milk, and legumes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unhealthy (poor quality) snacks are highly processed and sugary snacks. The classification of snacks is now roughly divided into original product snacks, initially processed snacks and deeply processed snacks. The first two are healthy snacks and the latter are unhealthy snacks. Take the potato chips that Westerners like to eat as an example. If they are cooked potatoes or potato chips with a little salt, they are original and primarily processed snacks. If they are fried and baked with various seasonings and made into potato chips, they are deeply processed snacks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although highly processed snacks account for only 1/3 of the average person’s daily food intake, their impact on the body can offset healthy meals, resulting in higher body mass index (BMI) and higher visceral fat. and higher triglyceride concentrations, all of which are associated with metabolic diseases such as obesity, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. This is a classic example of bad money beating good money when it comes to nutrition and health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Brits, popular snacks are biscuits, fruit, nuts and seeds, cheese and butter, cakes and pies, granola or cereal bars. Among them, unhealthy foods are cakes, cookies, pies, donuts, pastries, candies, ice cream and frozen dairy desserts, while nuts and seeds are among the healthier snacks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chinese people also like to eat snacks. In 2018, the &quot;Report on the Development of the Snack Industry in the Context of Consumption Upgrading&quot; released by the Ministry of Commerce of China pointed out that the total annual output value of China&#39;s snack industry has reached 2.21564 billion yuan. Although in recent years, snack manufacturers and sellers have promoted natural, whole grain, sugar-free, and additive-free snacks as popular labels for healthy snacks, unhealthy snacks are still flooding the market, including fried foods and pickled foods. , processed meat products (dried meat, floss, sausage, ham, etc.), biscuit foods (including all processed biscuits), soda and cola drinks, convenience foods (mainly instant noodles and puffed foods), canned foods, plums Candied fruit foods, frozen dessert foods (ice cream, popsicles, ice cream, etc.), barbecue foods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Spice strips, a famous Chinese snack that is widely loved by people at home and abroad, is an unhealthy snack (famous diver Quan Hongchan said that she likes spicy strips the most, and some manufacturers even sent her snacks. A cart of spicy strips). This is a type of cooked food product close to gluten type. It is made from wheat flour and/or other cereal flours as raw materials, added with salt, oil and other auxiliary materials, and processed through ingredients, extrusion cooking, molding, seasoning, packaging and other processes. There are less than 10 kinds of ingredients, but more than 10 kinds of food additives, and some even 20 kinds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This snack is high in oil and salt. A pack of spicy strips has a net content of 100 grams, of which fat accounts for 25 grams. According to the recommendations of the &quot;Dietary Guidelines for Chinese Residents&quot;, the average daily edible oil intake per person is 25-30 grams. The oil content in a pack of spicy strips is equivalent to people&#39;s daily fat intake. At the same time, a pack of spicy strips contains 7.3 grams of salt. Also according to the guidelines, the daily salt intake of healthy adults should not exceed 6 grams, children aged 2-3 should not exceed 2 grams, and children aged 4-6 should not exceed 3 grams. Children aged 7-10 years old should not exceed 4 grams. Elderly people over 65 years old should not exceed 5 grams. The salt content in a pack of spicy strips exceeds the recommended salt intake for adults and far exceeds the recommended amount for children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For children, it is this kind of unhealthy snacks that develops their later eating habits and tastes, lays the foundation for year-round intake of unhealthy diets, and also contributes to cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, obesity, and diabetes. Hidden dangers have been laid. Of course, unhealthy snacks also rely on their addictive properties to attract people and affect their health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another recently published study shows that highly processed foods, whether snacks or meals, rewire the brain&#39;s reward circuitry and activate the brain in a manner similar to cravings for cocaine. Highly processed foods can trigger addiction related to drugs or alcohol. One mechanism is that highly processed foods cause the release of dopamine in the brain (similar to amphetamine) and can lead to withdrawal symptoms (at least in children and teenagers), two hallmarks of addiction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Highly processed foods contain large amounts of sugar, salt, fat, artificial colors or preservatives, and contain other ingredients such as hydrogenated fats, fillers and starches to maximize flavor (called optimal taste point), thereby attracting people to continue eating. Moreover, hydrogenated fat or non-dairy creamer (creamer) tastes better than natural milk. Many people like to add it to their coffee. This delicious agent is also widely used in processed beverages and makes people addicted. This kind of fat is more harmful and difficult for the human body to decompose, and will aggravate the development of vascular diseases such as arteriosclerosis. Processed fructose, which is sweet and delicious, is also commonly used in beverages such as hydrogenated fat or non-dairy creamer, which can increase the occurrence of metabolic diseases and lead to addiction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course you have to eat snacks. The easiest way is to replace unhealthy snacks such as biscuits, potato chips and cakes with healthy snacks such as fruits and nuts. There are many healthy snack options, including fresh, natural foods. Vegetables such as cucumbers, tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, etc.; fruits such as strawberries, mangos, apples, pears, etc.; milks such as pure milk, sugar-free yogurt, low-salt cheese, etc.; beans such as sugar-free soy milk, tofu pudding, edamame, etc.; Original nuts such as walnuts, almonds, cashews, hazelnuts, pine nuts, dried fruits, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not impossible to eat biscuits and pastries, but you should choose those made with low sugar, salt and grains. The time when you eat snacks is also crucial to your health. If you eat snacks after 9 pm, your blood indicators will be worse and it will have a greater negative impact on your health. Therefore, you should not eat or eat less snacks after 9 pm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 24 Sep 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[叙利亚总统19年后再访华：加深两国政治互信，寻求经济合作]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257517]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-24 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On September 21, there was a gentle breeze in Hangzhou. As the plane landed at Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport, Syrian President Bashar Assad&#39;s visit to China officially began. This is Assad’s first visit to China in 19 years since 2004. During this trip, Bashar will also attend the opening ceremony of the Hangzhou Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China and Syria are both countries with ancient civilizations. From the connection due to the &quot;Silk Road&quot; to the connection between the &quot;Belt and Road&quot; initiative and Syria&#39;s &quot;Eastward&quot; strategy, economic and cultural exchanges between China and Syria have continued to deepen. In fact, friendly relations will become stronger over time. What is the deep meaning behind Assad’s visit to China? How can China-Syria relations be further developed? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, Sun Degang, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at Fudan University, and Wang Jin, associate professor at the Institute of Middle East Studies at Northwest University, pointed out to Nandu and N video reporters that Bashar’s visit to China not only hopes that China will continue to work on the reconstruction process of Syria There are also economic considerations in playing an active role. Wang Jin also emphasized that future exchanges and mutual learning between civilizations will be an important basis for people-to-people exchanges between China and Syria and an important guarantee for the development of bilateral relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“This visit to China will help deepen political mutual trust between the two countries”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to the Syrian National News Agency, Bashar led a high-level delegation in On September 21, he set off for a visit to China and participated in relevant activities in Beijing and Hangzhou. Nandu reporters noticed that Bashar’s last visit to China was in 2004, which was also the first visit to China by a Syrian head of state since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Syria in 1956. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/c2fb9eec2add497b898cc7fa7ac85d2d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;432&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/c2fb9eec2add497b898cc7fa7ac85d2d.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251764&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Xinhua News Agency/AP&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China and Syria have a profound friendship. Syria was one of the first Arab countries to establish diplomatic relations with the People&#39;s Republic of China and one of the sponsors of the restoration of China&#39;s lawful seat in the United Nations. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations 67 years ago, China-Syria relations have maintained healthy and stable development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The diplomacy of the heads of state plays a leading role in the development of China-Syria relations.” Sun Degang believes that China and Syria have the same views on safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and also have a common understanding of the multi-polar pattern. Diplomacy has played an overt role in deepening practical cooperation between the two sides in many fields.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before this visit to China, Bashar had already visited Iran last year, and this year visited Oman, Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia and China are the sixth stop of his visit since the civil war broke out in 2011. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After 19 years, Assad visits China again. What is the deep meaning behind it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, the world is undergoing major changes unprecedented in a century, and global peace and development are facing increasing uncertainties and unstable factors. Against the background of the &quot;reconciliation wave&quot; emerging in the Middle East, Sun Degang believes that the Syrian President&#39;s visit to China will help deepen political mutual trust between the two countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Bashar’s visit to China is first of all hoping to receive political support from China, including continuing to support Syria in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and continuing to play an active and constructive role in Syria’s reconstruction process. , to properly promote the reconstruction process in Syria.&quot; Wang Jin analyzed to the Nandu reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2011, the Syrian civil war broke out. Iran firmly supported the Bashar al-Assad government. The League of Arab States (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Arab League&quot;) suspended Syria&#39;s membership. Saudi Arabia and many other Arab countries closed their offices in Syria. embassy, ​​Syrian diplomacy has entered a state of relative isolation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/0fdbc92fb640cd041da104ad87aabb0d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;427&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/0fdbc92fb640cd041da104ad87aabb0d.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251765&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;The war-torn town of Deir ez-Zor in eastern Syria, taken on September 10, 2013.

Sun Degang told Nandu reporters that Syria has always supported China’s “Belt and Road” initiative and the global development initiatives and global security initiatives, and firmly supports China on the South China Sea, Xinjiang-related issues and other issues; China also firmly supports Syria in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, has upheld justice on many occasions in relevant votes of the United Nations Security Council, and defended Syria&#39;s national sovereignty and territorial integrity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nandu reporters learned that as a permanent member of the Security Council, most of the vetoes used by China in relevant votes of the Security Council are related to the Syrian issue. China has always spoken out fairly and acted in accordance with the merits and in safeguarding the interests of the Syrian people. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;The &#39;reconciliation tide&#39; in the Middle East has brought peace dividends to Syria&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On March 10 this year, Saudi Arabia and Iran reached the &quot;Beijing Agreement&quot;. The three parties signed and issued a joint statement announcing that Saudi Arabia and Iran agreed to resume diplomatic relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China is a sincere friend of Arab countries, and Chinese wisdom is constantly recognized by Arab countries. On April 29, when meeting with Zhai Jun, the Chinese government’s special envoy for the Middle East, Assad congratulated China on successfully mediating the resumption of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and believed that reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Iran would have an important and positive impact on the international pattern and regional situation. Syria thanks China for its active work in promoting Syria to improve relations with other Arab countries, and welcomes China to play a greater role in maintaining regional peace and stability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the Syrian civil war, Saudi Arabia announced its severing of diplomatic relations with Syria in 2012 due to its opposition to the Assad government. Two months after Saudi Arabia resumed diplomatic relations with Iran this year, Saudi Arabia and Syria also announced on May 9 that the two countries had resumed diplomatic relations. Sun Degang told Nandu reporters that China has promoted the normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, driving a &quot;tide of reconciliation&quot; in the Middle East and bringing peace dividends to Syria. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“With the resumption of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, Syria’s relations with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Turkey and other countries have further improved, and Syria’s external living space has been greatly improved. This will also help to enhance China-Syria relations, Deepen bilateral cooperation,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 10, Bashar was invited to attend the Arab League Summit Council meeting in Saudi Arabia. On May 22, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that China congratulated President Bashar on attending the Arab League Summit Council meeting and on the reunion of the Arab family. Syria&#39;s return to the Arab League fully demonstrates that Arab countries&#39; strengthening of unity and cooperation through dialogue and consultation is the aspiration of the people and the general trend. It also fully demonstrates that Arab countries have the ability to take their future and destiny into their own hands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jin believes that China’s global security initiative has effectively promoted world peace and development. “We hope to form a new security concept around the world that does not sacrifice mutual security. Rather, they are concerned about each other&#39;s security and form a bond of common interests in cooperation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;China and Syria have economic cooperation advantages&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2011 After the turmoil in Syria, the economic and trade cooperation between China and Syria was affected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, the bilateral trade volume between China and Syria will be US$427 million, a year-on-year decrease of 11.65%. Among them, China’s imports were US$20 million, a year-on-year increase of 124%; China’s exports were US$425 million, a year-on-year decrease of 11.93%. China mainly exports mechanical and electrical products, light industrial products, etc. to Syria. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jin admitted to Nandu reporters that due to the long-term sanctions imposed by Western countries, there are certain difficulties in cooperation between Syria and China, and it is necessary to understand rationally and steadily promote economic and trade cooperation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to his observation, the prospects for China-Syria economic and trade cooperation are very broad. &quot;Syria is rich in natural resources such as oil and has a superior geographical location. It is adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea and is an important bridge connecting Europe and Asia. Therefore, China and Syria have very great economic cooperation advantages.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nandu reporters noted that previous meetings There is no shortage of products from Syria at the CIIE. Damask rose is one of the oldest rose species in the world, and the essential oil extracted from it is called &quot;liquid gold&quot; by locals. At the CIIE booths, in addition to the fragrance of rose essential oil, there are also Syrian products such as olive oil and castile soap. Many Syrian companies feel the potential of the Chinese market at the CIIE. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China-Syria relations have a long history.

In this regard, Sun Degang believes that this reflects Syria&#39;s hope that China will leverage its infrastructure advantages in the reconstruction process of Syria, including transportation, electricity and other infrastructure construction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If the economically powerful Gulf Arab countries are willing to provide financial support to Syria, and China leverages its infrastructure advantages, relevant cooperation can steadily promote Syria&#39;s economic and social reconstruction.&quot; He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Syria had already shown its willingness to seek economic cooperation with China before visiting China. According to reports from the Syrian Arab News Agency and the Russian Satellite News Agency, on April 29 this year, when Bashar met with Zhai Jun, he specifically mentioned that it was becoming increasingly necessary to abandon the use of the U.S. dollar and that trade between countries could be settled in RMB. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jin analyzed to reporters from Nandu that Syria’s visit to China also has economic considerations. &quot;Syria also hopes that China will provide more economic support and assistance, especially welcoming more Chinese investors to invest in Syria and participate in Syria&#39;s socio-economic reconstruction.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 6 this year, southern Turkey approached Two strong earthquakes occurred in the Syrian border area within 12 hours, and China actively provided assistance. &quot;China will also be an important force in improving people&#39;s livelihood in Syria in the future.&quot; Sun Degang believes that the Syrian President&#39;s visit to China, in addition to deepening political mutual trust and strengthening economic and trade exchanges, will also help China and Syria strengthen cooperation in health, education, sports and other fields. . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“Exchanges and mutual learning between civilizations will be an important basis for people-to-people exchanges between China and Syria”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Hua Chunying said on 9 It was announced on March 21 that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad will attend the opening ceremony of the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Asian Games is a sports event for Asian youth and an important platform for cultural exchanges. &quot;This is a very important moment.&quot; Wang Jin believes that Assad&#39;s attendance at the opening ceremony of the Asian Games will bring important opportunities for people-to-people diplomacy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Leaders gather at this international cultural and sports event to share each other’s views, and head-of-state diplomacy also adds luster to this international event.” He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sports represents youth, health, and vitality, and is related to people&#39;s happiness and the future of the nation. It is reported that the Syrian team will participate in six competitions including wrestling, boxing, and weightlifting at this Asian Games. Athletes from China and Syria gathered together to add color to the diversity of the Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The Syrian president&#39;s coming to China to attend the opening ceremony of the Asian Games has sent a signal - he hopes that China and Syria can strengthen cooperation in the humanities field.&quot; Sun Degang told the Nandu reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China and Syria are both ancient civilizations. The exchanges between the two countries were connected by the &quot;Silk Road&quot; and continue to this day. The &quot;Silk Road&quot;, called the &quot;Road of Semiramis&quot; by the ancient Assyrians, started in China and passed through the land of Syria to Europe and the Maghreb region. The Syrian Minister of Culture once said that this road has enabled the Syrian people and the Chinese people to get to know each other and established a bridge for cultural exchanges. Customs, beliefs, and lifestyles have also influenced each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, ancient Chinese silk fabrics and ancient porcelain are collected in museums in Syria. The &quot;Stele of Popular Chinese Nestorianism in the Qin Dynasty&quot; collected by the Xi&#39;an Forest of Steles Museum in China has ancient Syrian inscriptions... each piece is precious. Cultural relics bear witness to the long history of cultural exchanges and mutual learning between the two countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/cf852266838b78b9744c286623c27e8d.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/cf852266838b78b9744c286623c27e8d.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251766&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Recently, the &quot;Syrian Ancient Cultural Relics Exhibition&quot; was displayed at the Guangdong Provincial Museum. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 20 this year, the &quot;Syrian Ancient Cultural Relics Exhibition&quot; co-organized by the Guangdong Provincial Museum and the China Cultural Relics Exchange Center was displayed at the Guangdong Provincial Museum.

In recent years, China has proposed the principle of exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations, which has been welcomed and supported by Syria and recognized by the Syrian government and people.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China-Syria relations have been affected by the rise of Eastern civilization. The common attributes are closely linked, and the two countries have great potential for cultural cooperation. Syria actively appreciates China&#39;s global civilization initiative, which promotes mutual respect among different civilizations and breaks down the &quot;clash of civilizations theory&quot;, &quot;civilization superiority theory&quot; and &quot;Western civilization-centered theory&quot;. In Sun Degang’s view, China-Syria cultural exchanges are a vivid reflection of China’s global civilization initiative. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In the future, exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations will be an important basis for people-to-people exchanges between China and Syria, and an important guarantee for the development of relations between the two countries. They will add luster to exchanges and mutual learning among world civilizations,&quot; Wang Jin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 24 Sep 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
