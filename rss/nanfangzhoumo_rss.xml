According to statistics, the number of applicants for the national postgraduate examination in 2024 is 4.38 million, a decrease of 360,000 or about 7.6% from the 4.74 million applicants for the postgraduate examination in 2023. This is also the first time in eight years that the number of applicants for the postgraduate examination has increased compared with the previous year. fall back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why has the number of postgraduate entrance examinations declined? The outside world has summarized some possible reasons: some graduates turned to the public entrance examination, striving to get an iron job in one step, and withdrew from the postgraduate entrance examination track; some graduates no longer regard the postgraduate entrance examination as a choice, thinking that it is just a matter of paper. A postgraduate diploma may not necessarily lead to a good job, so it is better to enter the job market in advance to save opportunity costs; the postgraduate recruitment policies of major universities have changed. &quot;The number of places for professional masters has increased and the number of places for academic masters has decreased&quot;, which has reduced the cost-effectiveness of postgraduate studies, and some prices Sensitive candidates give up in the face of high tuition fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to see that these reasons all stem from the rational choices of candidates as &quot;economic people&quot;: studying has increasingly become an investment, and the consumption attribute of higher education is also strengthening. If the candidates believe that studying for graduate school cannot improve the competitiveness of the job market and cannot bring good economic returns in the future, then the candidates will rationally consider &quot;whether studying for graduate school is worth it&quot;, thereby reducing the &quot;supply&quot; of the higher education market. There is a rumor going viral that a famous postgraduate entrance examination teacher successfully predicted the decline in the number of people taking the postgraduate entrance examination. In fact, this also shows that his &quot;preaching&quot; over the years has achieved certain results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a statistical point of view, the change in candidates&#39; attitudes has also taken several years, which is essentially a &quot;reverse incentive&quot; brought about by changes in the job market. Statistics on the number of applicants for postgraduate entrance examinations over the years show that this number declined in 2014 and 2015, but has shown an upward trend since 2015, reaching a peak in 2023. The year-on-year expansion of postgraduate enrollment and the increase in the number of graduates have made the job market supply unable to keep up with the employment demand of graduates. This imbalance in supply and demand has naturally been transmitted to the upstream higher education market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It should be admitted that in reality, only a small proportion of people go to graduate school to satisfy their personal enthusiasm for knowledge or for scientific research. Most students go to graduate school for employment, which can be subdivided. Further studies to postpone employment, and &quot;gold-plated graduate school&quot; for better employment. Unfortunately, both of these options are facing great challenges amid a weak job market. Of course, students are not fools and will also adjust their life strategies according to social reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key factors that affect the supply and demand of the job market are the economic cycle and industrial structure. The feedback from the job market also determines the cost-effectiveness of graduate school. None of the three parties, students, employers, or universities, can answer the question of “is graduate school worth it” alone? In the face of sluggish demand in the job market, both employers and candidates have begun to take action to answer this question: companies have reduced the scale of school recruitment, while candidates have seen a decline in the number of applicants. What is worth asking is, how will universities respond? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since this century, the number of postgraduate students enrolled in China has increased year by year, from 220,000 in 2003 to more than 1 million in 2020, and now accounts for about 10% of undergraduate graduates that year. Major universities have expanded their enrollment of master&#39;s degree students so rapidly over the years. On the one hand, they are of course adapting to the growing needs of the job market. On the other hand, they can also apply for more funds for themselves, charge more tuition fees, and improve various evaluation indicators. In short, it is to strive for more benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the &quot;reverse incentives&quot; in the job market, the sluggish fertility rate is destined to continue to reduce the number of postgraduate entrance examinations in the future, and the phenomenon of &quot;the merger of primary and secondary schools&quot; will sooner or later spread to higher education. field, this will be a more decisive factor in the future than &quot;candidates choose not to take the exam&quot;. In other words, the decline in the number of people taking postgraduate entrance examinations is an irreversible trend. In the future, colleges and universities may face a new enrollment gap of one million levels every year and have to face the severe situation of &quot;competition for existing students&quot;. This is a serious issue that colleges and universities need to deal with urgently. challenge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Reducing enrollment for master&#39;s degrees and expanding enrollment for associate&#39;s master&#39;s degrees&quot; and &quot;extending the academic system for associate&#39;s and master&#39;s degrees&quot; are the response plans that some colleges and universities have come up with. In this way, they can not only maintain the original enrollment scale, but also increase enrollment. Collect tuition fees. But the question is, when colleges and universities make a fuss about the academic system and quota of associate and master&#39;s degrees, can they really &quot;ensure the quality of training and improve employment competitiveness&quot;, or can they just &quot;charge one more year of tuition&quot; or even &quot;delay one year&quot;? &quot;Employment&quot; itself is quite debatable and deserves reflection. Some candidates&#39; doubts about the cost-effectiveness of master&#39;s degrees may be one of the reasons for the decrease in the number of postgraduate students this year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the principles of organizational behavior, &quot;organizations will work hard to create jobs for themselves, and employees of organizations will work hard to create jobs for each other.&quot; Since an organization has been established, it will do everything possible to maintain its existence, especially The public sector eats up financial resources. Public universities have long relied on taxpayers&#39; money to operate and do not need to directly face market competition. Naturally, they will find ways to maintain their existing graduate spots. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, changes in supply and demand in the job market and the impact of declining fertility rates will be transmitted sooner or later. The arrival of the enrollment gap has become an irreversible trend. The decline in the number of postgraduate entrance examinations this year is a timely warning to major universities. Comply with the needs of the job market, comprehensively consider social needs, adjust the recruitment plan for graduate students, and better serve the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 26 Nov 2023 17:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[从不被理解到亚运项目，中国电子竞技20年]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261341]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-26 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;On November 18, 2003, e-sports was listed as the 99th sports competition event by the State Sports General Administration.

He was referring to the interview with Southern People Weekly in 2019, when he had just graduated from the Central Academy of Drama. In the past few years, his acting career had become more mature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xincheng has appeared in more types of film and television works and discovered more diverse artistic skills, including participating in reality shows, releasing music albums, and expressing his thoughts more freely in interviews, showing a more relaxed attitude. On the one hand, &quot;I used to think this was not good, that was not good, but now I feel more confident.&quot; But he still habitually looks at himself and cares about his external presentation, just like when he was watching a movie on set Playback in the viewfinder, scrolling through audience comments on social media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The radar of self-examination is always on. Zhang Xincheng will often make corrections or additions to a sentence after finishing it. &quot;When making a movie, you will feel that you are dedicating yourself to art. ... The art here is a false proposition. It is not art in a broad sense, but the art you think you are. When you dedicate yourself to it, you will feel very ritualistic. &quot;Every time the team we work with work hard, everyone is immersed in it, there are no bystanders. Of course, there will be a creator trap for insiders, and they may go to the other extreme, but the process is wonderful.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Family education and schooling experience have shaped Zhang Xincheng’s serious and rigorous character. In middle school, he was taught to be a top student. &quot;My mother always told me not to do anything inappropriate, so I stuck to the rules most of the time.&quot; After entering the Chinese Opera, he was taught to be a good actor. He will use an academic attitude to talk about performance, how to speak lines accurately and naturally, and how to design habitual actions to distinguish characters. His rationality and prudence even allow him to design the flaws of characters, because perfect people do not exist. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Zhang Xincheng feels that he is not a very self-motivated person in nature. He is lazy and procrastinates. He is also not a person who uses rationality to choose the optimal solution. He is more willing to follow his inner thoughts of escape. After working, like all young people who are just beginning to try to be independent, he slowly freed himself from the shackles of previous disciplines and &quot;opened up&quot; himself through the profession of actor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xincheng, who views himself &quot;rationally&quot;, is more &quot;emotional&quot; in his choice of scripts. He still tends to choose tragic characters that he is more interested in, such as Cheng Yizhi in &quot;The Light&quot;, who is born like Weed, who has been tortured, has seen all the darkness and filth in the world; Pei Zhi in &quot;The Basics of Genius&quot; has been making a choice between sacrificing for his family and pursuing himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xincheng has gained an ancient Greek tragic aesthetic in these characters, &quot;Life itself is dull, but the life in the drama has ups and downs. There may be a car accident, and the life will be broken; there may be a meeting To the death of loved ones. But pain is directly proportional to happiness. During the filming process, the more pain and torture I experienced, the more happiness I felt in retrospect.&quot; In the unusual tragic experience, the perceptual switch was turned on. Open it, &quot;I can feel the emotions of the world more and start to receive signals.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Equal time&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s like building blocks high and then knocking them all down again. From learning to be a Since he was an actor, Zhang Xincheng has been training himself to shape characters, designing and reviewing at the same time. When filming &quot;Basic Method of Genius&quot;, he felt that these external formal things were &quot;finished&quot; and no longer needed to be done deliberately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I suddenly noticed that when I say a line, I don’t just say it to rhythm and handle it well, but to put this sentence into the opponent’s heart. Every expression and line I make, It is stimulating the opponent. All the designs are not important. When you feel the emotion in your heart, you will naturally express it.&quot; When filming &quot;Dark Fire&quot;, Zhang Xincheng acted in Mandarin with dialect color, and he no longer thought about how to act. He spoke his lines but didn&#39;t say a single word wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The process of building, tearing down and rebuilding was not peaceful and was accompanied by long periods of anxiety. Zhang Xincheng&#39;s debut went smoothly. He started taking roles while he was in school, and one crew followed another. But he felt that he did not have a particularly distinctive trait that made people remember him, and he could not find one for himself. &quot;It seems difficult for me to do it.&quot; When participating in a reality show, he should have found a way to highlight himself, but he was still used to it. hide behind; follow your heart when choosing a script. When the results are not satisfactory, you will inevitably fall into self-doubt, &quot;Am I not capable enough?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Until this year, Zhang Xincheng was able to say it calmly. , &quot;I can&#39;t do this&quot;, and can accept all choices calmly, &quot;I want to understand, time is equal, you didn&#39;t do that thing in those four months, but you did other things, you got It’s like opening a box, you can only choose one box, and you can’t see the contents of other boxes. You lose the other boxes, but you get this one.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After the sense of gain and loss and utilitarianism became less strong, looking back on the past, he finally changed his self-evaluation passing score to 90 points. &quot;If life is lived for a result, it seems that time will become shorter. If the process is unfolded, , it seems that a lot of things have happened, just have fun in the process.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xincheng knows what the pinnacle of his career is: to become a highly reputable actor, not just for his excellent acting skills. , has commercial value, is respected by others, and is unique. He also missed the beginning of his career. At an age when he didn’t know what filming was, he had endless energy every day. After filming, he would play with the crew and take photos with costumes, props, and scene management. “I don’t think so. I was stupid at that time, and I thought it was quite valuable. It took a long time to receive education and change the habits of childhood, but it would be very difficult to finally return to the freedom of childhood.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;True The Paradox&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What adjectives would you use to describe yourself? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Xincheng: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Lazy, out-of-the-box thinking, and optimistic. I used to think that I was pessimistic, because I often saw things in a bad light, but I found that there might be a layer of optimism underneath the pessimism. After thinking about it, I still felt that things would definitely get better, and I still believed in some hope. Although I prefer tragedies, it is precisely because I have a relatively optimistic core that I like tragedies and dare to watch them. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you think is your most distinctive trait? , a trait that comes to mind when everyone mentions it, or do you think you have such a trait? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Xincheng: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I don’t think I have such a trait. Everyone knows that I usually play the roles I have played, but actually I don’t know either. What are your own personal characteristics. In this short video era, people are always required to have a very obvious label. But I feel like I&#39;m not that kind of person. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When you participate in a reality show, you will give Do you want to find a characteristic that you want to show to everyone? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Xincheng: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;No, I participated in the variety show just to rest, not to highlight myself. I don’t speak much in it, and I don’t lead opinions. Everyone says you have to do this or that, stand out and let everyone remember you. I think that will put a lot of pressure on me. I am not a person who talks a lot at any time, so I don’t force myself to talk deliberately. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you think you are in the reality show? The real you? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Xincheng: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Reality shows have a very real part. Not everything is deliberately created, but people have many shortcomings. In real people, When I show off, I try my best to cover up these shortcomings and try my best to be the best version of myself. I feel that this is not the real me. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is different when you are acting, because you are not yourself, so you are very free. When we were children, we played a game called &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; in which we raced and shot. In reality, no one would do this because they are bound by morality, but in the game there is no such thing. It does not mean that everyone desires to do sinful things. It just means you are freest when you are not yourself. The role is played by you, and you do his things, but people don’t think you are him. You are not “you”, but you are “you”. Instead, reality shows must become a better “you”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You often share your life on social media, what do you like to shoot? What kind of photos? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Xincheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;According to my previous personality, I didn’t like to record. Why should we record? Can’t we just move forward? Now I will stop and take a few photos without knowing what I am taking, as if it is stored in the camera forever. I especially don&#39;t like to delete any record. So much memory is just for a certain moment in life, and I suddenly want to see it. I don&#39;t want this to get lost. It felt like I had seized the moment. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I like to take black and white photos, high-contrast black and white, followed by photos with rich tones. It is a flaw that does not restore reality very well, but it is also a kind of beauty and has a sense of story. The sense of story is what attracts me, because there are so many good-looking things that make people dazzled and even attracted. But a photo with a story is rare in daily life and is relatively precious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 26 Nov 2023 15:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[守护“千年鸟道”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261251]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-26 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/22/eOvutWJW8Nobv2bGQ5Xv1RJqvRtwZxeiKuL383km.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;669&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/eOvutWJW8Nobv2bGQ5Xv1RJqvRtw ZxeiKuL383km. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259229&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 26, 2023, Congjiang Town, Guidong County, Hunan Province and Jiangxi Province At the Nanfengao Migratory Bird Protection Station at the junction of Yingpanwei Township, Suichuan County, bird rangers from the two provinces and two counties conduct joint bird protection inspections in the mountains &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Guo Liliang/Photo)&lt;/ span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Billions of migratory birds migrate across continents every year, and 3 of the 8 migration routes pass through China.

Recently, some new energy vehicle owners have reported that charging fees at public charging piles have increased since the second half of the year. Does this situation exist? With this question in mind, reporters conducted investigations in many places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Drivers of operating vehicles are more sensitive to changes in charging fees for new energy vehicles. Master Wei is an online ride-hailing driver in Zhengzhou, Henan, because he goes to public charging stations to charge once or twice a day. His mobile phone clearly records the cost of each charge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/8707fe1a673b3f7a07d093f566fc40ca.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/8707fe1a673b3f7a07d093f566fc40ca.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259659&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Henan Zhengzhou Net Ride-hailing driver Wei Zhenhua: My charging fee has obviously increased. It used to be 1,200 yuan a month, but now it is as high as 1,500 yuan. It has indeed increased a lot. Especially after August, it rose by about 20 to 30%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The charging fee at public charging piles consists of two parts: electricity price and service fee. Electricity prices have been mainly formed by the market, with &quot;level in and level out&quot; and charging pile operators are not allowed to increase prices. Prices vary in different seasons and during peak, wave, and flat periods every day. The service fee is determined by each charging pile operating company based on market conditions. During the interview, the reporter found that charging fees at public piles have increased not only in Zhengzhou but also in many cities in Henan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/06b4189b0c487b25cc2eed44e60cad19.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;662&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/06b4189b0c487b25cc2eed44e60cad19.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259661&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A new energy Co., Ltd. Henan regional director Yu Haitao: We charging companies have raised the service fee for primary charging. It has been raised by about 1 jiao to 1 jiao and 2 cents compared to the beginning of the year. So overall, everyone feels the increase in charging prices. The amplitude is relatively large. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Surveys show that the service fees of some charging companies have even increased by about 50%. So, why do they want to adjust the price? Some charging pile operating companies told reporters that the high cost of early investment in charging pile construction and the long-term strategy of &quot;grabbing the market&quot; for low-price operations have put them under greater operating pressure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/97ea8d2c1b65c4cf380c9c6814e67c0b.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/97ea8d2c1b65c4cf380c9c6814e67c0b.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259657&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An electronics company in Henan Wei Hongyu, Operations Director of Technology Co., Ltd.: The main reason for this increase is that as our operations deepen, we find that there is even a risk of inversion in the service fee income of charging stations compared to our station construction costs and our operating costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Financial reports of some charging operation companies show that although the company&#39;s operating income is rising every year, it is negative profits every year. At the same time, in order to attract more users, operators tend to build high-power charging piles. However, the basic cost of high-power charging piles is relatively high. Some also need to build additional corresponding distribution boxes, and maintenance costs will naturally increase. . Therefore, raising service fees has become the current solution to recover costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The cost of using new energy vehicles still has a greater advantage than that of gasoline vehicles&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Through interviews and surveys, the reporter found that in some cities, the cost of charging electric vehicles has indeed increased. So this situation Does it happen in all cities across the country? Are the cost advantages of buying an electric car still there? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During interviews and surveys in many places, reporters found that the rise in charging costs for new energy vehicles only occurred in some cities, and charging costs in most cities across the country fell into a stable range. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/51786d4413d5411912229c0755b9dc9e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/51786d4413d5411912229c0755b9dc9e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259658&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beijing New Energy Car owner: There is not much increase. I have charged at several nearby charging stations. There is not much change. It is basically the same as before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shenzhen new energy vehicle owners: The electricity price at this time is 1.27 yuan per kilowatt hour. The overall cost is not particularly high and it is quite affordable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data from the China Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Promotion Alliance show that from January to October this year, the number of public charging piles in my country was 728,000, and the number in October was 63,000, a year-on-year increase of 50.3%. The increase in the number of charging piles not only meets the rapid development of new energy vehicles, but also makes competition among charging pile operating companies more intense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/b7fa96dfbaeb011d9617520d6d2e690a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/b7fa96dfbaeb011d9617520d6d2e690a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259662&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A smart phone in Beijing Chen Dong, the person in charge of Technology Co., Ltd.: The overall charging price is still relatively low now, because the competition in the industry is fierce. We have more than 40 charging stations in Beijing. Winter is the peak charging season, and the overall cost has not been adjusted upwards. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Experts said that fluctuations in charging fees in most cities are the result of market supply and demand adjustments, and the quality of increases or decreases cannot be judged absolutely. Most cities have now abolished the maximum price limit on service fees, and each operator can determine the level of charging service fees based on market competition. At the same time, in the face of the issue raised by some netizens that the cost of using new energy vehicles is almost equal to that of gasoline vehicles, experts also gave reporters a calculation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/4bc772773657773a07d7dfe0eb594a4d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/4bc772773657773a07d7dfe0eb594a4d.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259660&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China Electric Power Corporation Liu Yongdong, deputy secretary-general of the federation: For example, for every 100 kilometers of our oil truck, the industry requires about 10 liters of oil. We estimate that it will be calculated at about 8 yuan, which is 80 yuan. Let&#39;s look at the tram again. On average, it requires about 15 kilowatt hours of electricity per 100 kilometers. The overall consumption of each kilowatt hour of electricity plus service fees is about 1.5 yuan. So the entire 15 kilowatt hours of electricity is about 22.5 yuan. Even if it is 25 yuan, we Comparing 25 yuan with 80 yuan, it should be said that there is still a huge gap. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; Various regions have launched new measures to shape the healthy development of new energy vehicles&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In order to ensure a good charging experience for new energy vehicle owners, various regions have successively introduced new policies such as time-of-use electricity prices for charging facilities. The implementation of relevant measures will not only guide car owners to use electricity rationally, but will also be more conducive to the healthy and sustainable development of the new energy vehicle industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September this year, Shandong began to implement a new time-of-use electricity price policy for residents&#39; charging, which subdivided the peak and valley periods and added deep valley and peak periods. During the deep valley period, the electricity price was 0.222 yuan per kilowatt hour, which is the same as The price difference during peak hours is 0.666 yuan per kilowatt hour. By widening the price difference, users are guided to avoid charging during peak hours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/97416b76a8b4710da6eed33e4ef12df7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/97416b76a8b4710da6eed33e4ef12df7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259663&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jimo District, Qingdao New energy vehicle owners: Now the electricity price in Shengu for charging at noon is only more than 2 cents per degree. If you go home and have a meal, the electricity will be fully charged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only Shandong, but also Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hunan, Shaanxi and other places have successively introduced time-of-use electricity price policies for residents’ electric vehicle charging facilities. During peak and peak hours, charging car owners need to bear more costs, and During off-peak periods, car owners can enjoy lower prices than before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/ac2c310d54f1abcd7b404c830cf87215.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/ac2c310d54f1abcd7b404c830cf87215.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259667&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shenzhen New Energy Car owner: It is the peak period for charging now. The current price is 1.49 degrees. We usually choose to charge at noon or at night, and the price will be more favorable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the continued efforts of government policies, some charging operating companies are also actively exploring new trends in future development. On the one hand, it is necessary to add new momentum to corporate operations, and on the other hand, the charging experience of car owners must also be considered. In order to &quot;stand out&quot; in the market competition, they choose to provide more comprehensive services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/97bd9ffcf65eb191c4e283ced6f959ab.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/97bd9ffcf65eb191c4e283ced6f959ab.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259665&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A new person in Shenzhen Chen Huanyu, operations director of the energy company: Our service fee is only about a little more than a triangle, which is 5% higher than the service fee of surrounding operators. Our advantage is that the supporting facilities are relatively complete, which solves the driver&#39;s dining problem. To solve the problem of rest, we also have a comprehensive service area with quick car repairs, quick washes, and a comprehensive online car-hailing service platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, charging operation companies have also strengthened the level of interconnection and interoperability. In Hainan, the reporter saw that the supervision and operation service platform linked different operators together.

The access rate of the province&#39;s public charging pile platform reaches 100%.

Waking up early and staying late has become the norm. Getting up at 4 a.m. to go to the airport and returning home at 1:30 a.m. after finishing the day&#39;s activities is not an exception. Not staying out overnight is partly to take care of my young daughter’s emotions, but also to satisfy her pursuit of efficiency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She rarely used it to catch up on sleep when flying, but still raced against time to read and think. Since 2013, she has continued to travel to campuses of all ages, TV studios, events, lectures, forums, and dining tables used for live broadcasts and writing, sharing her deep dives in the Western Pacific with the &quot;Jiaolong&quot; Scientific expedition and the experience of participating in the 34th Antarctic Scientific Expedition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At first, she only gave lectures as a scientist as a researcher at the Second Institute of Oceanography of the Ministry of Natural Resources. Over the past ten years, she has gradually been dubbed a science popularization expert because of her tireless science popularization and vivid and humorous narration. title. In the past two years, she has won important honors such as Top Ten Science Communication Figures in China, Chief Science Communication Expert, and Female Science Popularization Expert. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the day of the interview, she spared a few hours, ate a sandwich at noon, and rushed home to prepare for the live broadcast at 4 p.m. Not long ago, she went to attend classes at universities and party schools. The topic she taught was the core of leadership from the perspective of biological evolution, from natural science to humanities and then to philosophy (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;This is her usual style&lt;/span>;), recalling her hearty smile and said, &quot;There was no urine in the whole process&quot;; then she was also invited to participate in a TED speech, the theme was &quot;If your major is a transfer, you What will happen next in life?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Experienced the transition from engineering to science (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Undergraduate survey technology and engineering, postgraduate geological engineering, doctoral geology&lt;/p>; span>;), Tang Limei decided to switch his research field to marine geology after listening to a lecture by chance while studying for his PhD. He realized early on that life has no limits and is full of unexpected and unplanned nodes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With ten years of accumulation in science popularization, she will bring a new book &quot;Exploring the Deep Sea with the &quot;Dragon&quot;&quot; at the end of 2023 to show people a new face of a science popularization writer. The book will introduce the basic knowledge of the ocean (&lt;span style= &quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For example, what is the sea, what is the ocean, how to form&lt;/span>;), the five major oceans of the world (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Newly included in the Southern Ocean in 2021&lt;/span>;)&#39;s cutting-edge knowledge, personal experience in deep-sea exploration, and the development history of the country&#39;s manned deep submersibles, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It took less than half a year to write the book. She was busier than before. She didn&#39;t even have time to wash her face after getting up every morning. She said that her days now consist of only three things: work, exercise, and reading and thinking. She has been able to maintain her body shape for nearly 20 years after getting up early for a run. During the interview, she was wearing the team uniform she wore during the Antarctic scientific expedition in 2017, and it still fit her perfectly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other than that, there are very few pastimes, and I hardly watch movies. Everything I do must &quot;generate value and meaning.&quot; She would refuse without hesitation if asked to travel to the beach. Only when it became a matter of spending time with her children and family would she be willing to do so. &quot;I can&#39;t go out to play by myself, but I&#39;m willing to do it with others. It&#39;s valuable.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She recalled more than ten years ago when life was not so full. , I still have plenty of time to watch &quot;The Legend of Zhen Huan&quot;, and during the period when I went to the Pacific to &quot;isolate&quot;, I watched it intermittently nearly 20 times in total. &quot;It wouldn&#39;t be so busy then. I would definitely choose to read a book now.&quot; It wasn&#39;t until 2022 that she turned the content of the TV series into a class, and then she finally let go of the time wasted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/GDFKKq1U2uGe4wXxCkfhZo5gEfOBJvo01JL7UOFU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/GDFKKq1U2uGe4wXxCkfhZo5gEfOBJvo01JL7UOFU.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259210&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Ocean Open Class&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(video screenshot/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The lecture content revolves around &quot;Zhen Huan&quot; &quot;Scientific trivia in the Biography&quot;, &quot;For example, there is an episode where the emperor went to An Lingrong&#39;s place to celebrate her birthday. He was very tired of eating, so he happened to get him some light pastries. Why do we eat dessert after a meal? It&#39;s because we The perception of sweetness is at the tip of the tongue, and the perception of bitterness is at the back of the tongue, and then there are other areas in the middle, such as spicy food. Therefore, we can still eat something sweet after a meal because we can feel sweetness at the tip of the tongue at the earliest. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There is also braised pork, which is the Maillard reaction. Isn&#39;t the Maillard color popular this year? Maillard is actually caramel color, which is what it turns into after the sugar is burned. Color, what happens between it and braised pork is the Maillard reaction. Why do we need to add sugar? When you make braised pork, you can educate your children about science. These knowledge points are closely related to life; and why do we have oleander powder? Poisonous? I explained its formula, and then what is the most poisonous part of it? Tree trunks, leaves and flowers are all poisonous. Finally, why are these women fighting in the play? These are the backward ideas of feudal society. Let’s talk about it finally. The awakening of women in our new era includes humanistic methods.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She believes that subject segmentation is actually unscientific because &quot;all knowledge is interlinked&quot; and is often lacking in the dissemination of knowledge. Not even one. She likes the title of &quot;Science Communication Figure&quot;, &quot;It&#39;s quite appropriate. Just like preaching, science is also a cognitive system.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She looks at everything around her with a comprehensive view of the universe and cherishes it. With curiosity, &quot;Actually, everything is learning. You may have thought it was entertainment before, but with a learning mentality, if you really understand the background, culture or meaning of TV series, movies and other cultural works, it is actually learning.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;In her spare time during the Antarctic scientific expedition, Tang Limei also watched a few sporadic movies, including the literary film &quot;Sunset Trilogy&quot; series, which she also watched repeatedly. What attracts her is not the romantic encounter between the male and female protagonists, but the social topics that the two communicate and discuss from sunset to sunrise. &quot;In fact, the most attractive thing about it is its topic. It is not that two people are in love, they discuss They are all the destruction of society by developed countries, the infringement of weak countries, the garbage we produce now, the underlying logic of society, etc.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She has also watched some of &quot;Celebrating More Than Years&quot; and she likes it. With time-travel elements, I am also planning to write some science fiction novels next, &quot;For example, two fishes (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;because we humans evolved from fish (&lt;/span>;), a story of pure love that has gone through five mass extinctions, nine evolutions, and then traveled through several lives. In this long evolution, &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; is set in the universe. It may be based on the hundreds of millions of years of biological evolution.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that she is in the conceptual stage, she is already very excited. &quot;It should be particularly enjoyable if I write it later. In fact, this is a process of creation. The meaning of life lies in creation. Only when you create something you love, will you feel happy and in a flow.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2019, she participated in a training session at the Youth League School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and later became a member of the Youth Lecturers Group of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. Since then, she has frequently given lectures in colleges and universities. She noticed that the new generation of young people are increasingly concerned about spiritual values. &quot;Public welfare must be the trend in the future. There will definitely be more and more people engaged in charity and volunteer services among the post-2000 generation, because it may be difficult for them to make a rapid economic leap from their work, so they will look for other ways. To realize your own value, engage more in charity and manual work, that is, to help others and feel happiness from the process of serving others.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There will be more and more of these industries, like my daughter, What can you say to make her feel happy? It’s not that her mother went to her school and gave a speech. Everyone regarded me as an idol and worshiped me. This was a pressure for her; her happiness was similar to that once I took her to a friend&#39;s birthday party, and after she gave the butterfly she made with a twist stick to someone else, she felt sincerely happy because of the other person&#39;s gratitude.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first book has not yet been released, and it is non-stop. Tang Limei has already begun to imagine her future &quot;writing ambitions&quot;. &quot;If I publish one book every year, I can probably write 20 more in my life. I hope one or two of them will be popular science classics for teenagers.&quot; Through these words again and again. and written words. What she is committed to disseminating is not only scientific knowledge, but also &quot;the meaning of life.&quot; She hopes that her slightly tortuous but persevering experience can inspire young people and make those young faces in the audience understand, &quot;Everyone should have their own way out and live well.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 26 Nov 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[吴慷仁，给自己拍拍手吧]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261336]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-26 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/25/ZJCNUHvqqsswjIpk4Tq6AEUJT96BP6xETrXHQmgA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/ZJCNUHvqqsswjIpk4Tq6AEUJT96BP 6xETrXHQmgA. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259646&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wu Kangren (Visual China) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Newcomer Wu Kangren&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Wu Kangren is standing in the middle of the lobby of a hotel in Xiamen, dancing and talking with people.

By 2015, he left his agent to work independently. Just before he was about to win his first Golden Bell Award, Wu Kangren suddenly took off his mask. &quot;Wearing a mask is uncomfortable,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When someone looked at him, he looked back with a smile; when someone patted him, he waved his hand from a distance; when someone stared at him, he slowly changed his position to avoid it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“When I didn’t care much about what other people thought of me, I felt a lot less burdened.” Wu Kangren said, “I began to realize that the identity I originally cared about was just my career and an external label. . I want to get back my identity and my life. What I have to do at the moment is the most important, such as going out to buy things.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past ten years, Wu Kangren has starred in many word-of-mouth movies.

In Xiamen, young people shouted to him: &quot;Gao Jiayue, praise, praise, praise!&quot; &quot;Gao Jiayue is his character in the new drama &quot;Lifetime&quot;, and his catchphrase is &quot;Zan Zan Zan&quot;.

It has won awards at many international film festivals. Wu Kangren won this year&#39;s First Youth Award Best Actor at the Film Festival.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He received the First trophy in Xiamen, took a group photo, and then held it halfway. He was also the Best Actor in this year&#39;s First Film Festival media selection. When he heard that there were also trophies for the venue selection, he shook with joy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He cherishes every recognition he gets, whether it is an award or the favor of his seniors. This is why he often plays guest roles. : To repay a favor. He made a cameo appearance as a pervert who sexually harassed a female subordinate in the TV series &quot;Her and Her Her&quot;, but he couldn&#39;t find an actor for this disgusting role. Out of gratitude for the producer of the show who had taken care of him in the past, Wu Kangren took over the role. The original male lead of &quot;Copycat&quot; missed the appointment due to schedule, and the crew was at a standstill. They were in urgent need of a replacement who could be accepted by Netflix. It was Wu Kangren again. In order not to affect the follow-up film appointments, he rushed to work for 16 days in a row. He only sleeps two or three hours a day.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He thanked Chen Huiling, the director of &quot;Next Stop, Happiness&quot; many times. &quot;(To the director) jokingly said that there was no opportunity to perform in &quot;Next Stop&quot; at that time, maybe now I was still serving plates in restaurants and stuff like that, but I actually meant it. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2009, Wu Kangren starred in the idol drama &quot;Next Stop, Happiness&quot; as Hua Takuya, the second male lead who silently protected the heroine for many years and finally let go. He created a chapter in the history of Taiwanese idol dramas Classic: With tears in his eyes, he suppressed the sadness rushing out of his chest, and said to the heroine with a smile: &quot;Why, I was the one who met you first, but you still chose to lead him six years ago and six years later. hand. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/UfGy4Qfh5w7K2VHjG4Qa5ctSc3ksZ3zcvRcMN3h6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height =&quot;1024&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/UfGy4Qfh5w7K2VHjG4Qa5ctSc3ksZ3zcvRcMN3h6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259648&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot; color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Next Stop, Happiness (2009) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I watched it for the first time He was surprised when he was acting, how could someone crying be so touching. I asked director Chen Huiling, and the director said it was because he was acting with his life. &quot;said screenwriter Lu Shiyuan. Wu Kangren later became the leading actor in her works &quot;The Exit Office&quot; and &quot;The Distance Between Us and Evil&quot;. Both of these dramas brought Wu Kangren nominations for Best Actor at the Golden Bell Awards.&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;In this way, Wu Kangren, who had just quit his job as a bartender, emerged with &quot;Hua Tuoye&quot;. At the age of 27, he encountered his favorite job: acting. &quot;After acting reaches a certain stage, it is no longer for me. A way to make money for a living. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, &quot;Next Stop, Happiness&quot; was the last peak of Taiwanese idol dramas. Since then, Taiwanese dramas, which have been popular in Asia for ten years, have been declining. What is mutually responsible for the decline of Taiwanese dramas is that mainland TV dramas and Korean dramas gradually occupied Taiwanese TV stations, and Taiwanese dramas that lost their audience also lost the funds of the TV stations. It was also at that time that the backbone of Taiwanese dramas and future stars, such as Ethan Ruan, Zhao Youting, Chen Bolin, Ariel Ariel, Chen Qiaoen, etc., all turned to the mainland Development.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Newcomer Wu Kangren stayed in Taiwan and worked hard to act in his own way.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Like a foreign worker&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Starring &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; was won by Wu Kangren.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What he saw was the synopsis of the venture capital period.

One day he was staring at his cat and suddenly felt that filming in Taiwan was out of his comfort zone, and he wanted to change places. He thought of &quot;Fudu Youth&quot;, so he called the director and asked if you were still filming and if you didn&#39;t plan to find me.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The director also told me honestly: they do have other candidates. . But I feel that I am very sincere and can go to Malaysia a month earlier and the (remuneration) can be cheaper. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Wu Kangren, &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; is a rare opportunity. Nowadays, professional dramas are popular in Taiwan. He has portrayed etiquette masters, lawyers, prosecutors, etc. He has also tried many unconventional characters, For example, mamasang, habitual thieves who steal women&#39;s underwear, etc. This is how he trains himself.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/25/oFjvo5nnR54pP2w1ScDw66JDokygZzTeBkAo528W.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/oFjvo5nnR54pP2w1ScDw66JDokygZzTe BkAo528W. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259639&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Fudu Youth (2023) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Fudu Youth&quot; is different. The people in the film have no career difficulties. They seem unconventional and marginal, but they actually exist in Malaysia. It tells the story of a pair of undocumented foreign workers. The brothers are living an ignoble existence in an old community in Fudu where foreign workers gather. The elder brother Abang (played by Wu Kangren) was born mute, and he works hard and accepts his fate. The younger brother Adi (played by Chen Zeyao) is unwilling to bow to fate. He only wants to make money and takes his brother with him. Leave this disgusting place.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Lilin is the producer of the movies &quot;Decibel Life&quot; and &quot;Lost Andy&quot;. When he was filming for &quot;Decibel Life&quot;, he observed that there were many problems in the Pudu community of Kuala Lumpur. Foreign workers, lonely elderly people, transgender people, etc. Three years later, he decided to shoot his first film with some unidentified people as the protagonists in the market of Fudu.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot; Since &quot;Decibel Life&quot;, I have wanted to be close to these people, and I feel very strongly about them. &quot;Wang Lilin said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This movie, from the director to the leading actors, followed the principle of &quot;really listening, seeing, and feeling.&quot; After Wu Kangren and Chen Zeyao worked in the market and learned sign language for about a month, the movie was released in Filming in Fudu has officially started.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fudu has a smell. The market where you work has the smell of fish, chicken and sweet fruits, and the enclosed building where you live has the smell of food, soap, sweat and Urine.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the film, there is a close-up scene of washing hands. Wu Kangren carefully rubs each fingernail. &quot;This is indeed an action I do every day at the end of the day, because the smell on my hands is so rich. &quot;Wu Kangren said, &quot;When I smoked, I smelled the smell of offal on my fingertips, so I thought, hey, let&#39;s wash it again. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The script gives branches, but the flesh and blood of the film depends on the actors themselves.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Abang makes a living by killing chickens and moving goods, so Wu Kangren killed chickens that were 20 days old— —Although the director initially did not plan to shoot a scene of killing a chicken. Eggs can be found by poking the butt of a chicken, and foreign workers often eat the eggs raw. They wanted to give them to Wu Kangren several times, and Wu Kangren repeatedly said, &quot;Thank you, thank you, thank you.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;Although the raw eggs were not eaten, Wu Kangren brought this detail into the movie: Abang, who came home from work, carried a bag of eggs and shared them with his neighbor and his daughter.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He wanted to let I am truly like a foreign worker in a rich city. Not only can I work, but I have also become black, thin and slovenly. &quot;When I first went there, I was like this now. I weighed more than 70 kilograms in vain. Don&#39;t spill the soup on me. appearance. &quot; He recalled, &quot;But when you really step into that market, you will find that everyone looks at you very differently, and you are out of place. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He imitated the state of foreign workers, unkempt, with sweat and animal blood on his body, and the look in his eyes was tired after repeating the action of killing chickens two hundred times a day. They collected money and handed over He had no energy to have more interactions with people.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He was killing chickens while approaching Fudu. He smoked, ate, and chatted with the foreign workers, looking at the expired passports they carried with them, and listening to their He talked about having a girlfriend or quarreling with his wife. He observed rats and said that he had never seen rats that looked like they had been trained. They ran past in groups, clanking and clanking, and dispersed like Moses parting the sea when they saw people. Together again.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he felt that there were no more eyes sizing him up, he knew that he could play Abang.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From May to August 2022, Wu Kangren completed filming continuously In &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; and the Hong Kong movie &quot;May I Live Forever&quot;, after four months of starvation, a 1.78 meter man lost weight to 53 kilograms. He did not want to say how much weight he had lost, after all, &quot;if the film was not filmed well , everyone thinks you are just thin, what’s the big deal?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/HR6YC0Q5tY8zSLc1MzpQtmSFEmEJMYfHTCgmVBXT .jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/HR6YC0Q5tY8zSLc1MzpQtmSFEmEJMYfHTCgmVBXT.jpg&quot; data-key =&quot;259640&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;May you live forever (2023) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the film comes to an end, Abang does not eat or drink in prison and wants to die. Wu Kangren also fasted to keep himself in a state of malaise that continues to decline.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He made fasting easy, saying that once he fasted his skin would be healed, white and smooth.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years, Wu Kangren&#39;s weight change curve, which has waxed and waned due to his acting roles, is a series of &quot;W&quot;s, at 30 kg The gap fluctuated between them. When he first lost weight rapidly for the movie &quot;Termites&quot; (2016), he was a little optimistic, thinking that if his body changed first, he would be able to observe the psychological changes. He was also a little intentional, thinking that this might be able to be used in acting. There are unexpected effects.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before becoming an actor, he sweated and sweated on the construction site and got paid, so he firmly believed that hard work would be rewarded. He washed cups in the kitchen and had to work on the countertop and off stage. Just as clean, this later even became his belief: I, Wu Kangren, show you the same in person as I do in private. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same goes for getting fatter and thinner. No one knew what to gain by acting like this, but he wanted to know; he&#39;d tried it, so he knew the power of shape-shifting. &quot;I&#39;m quite fortunate to have done this. It helped me a lot.&quot; He said, &quot;This is irreplaceable and is self-cultivation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Mute&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; h4>; &lt;p>;When &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; was finalized, the crew gave Wu Kangren a cake, and he started crying when he saw the cake. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I can finally eat!&quot; He said that he was so excited that he cried. &quot;I went to eat chicken the day after the filming was completed!&quot; Once again, Wu Kangren solved the difficulty with a joke. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before Abang was executed, the prison arranged for him to meet with the Master for his final confession. In this play, the director gave full play to &quot;listening, watching, and feeling&quot;: Wu Kangren&#39;s script only has the word &quot;accusation&quot; and no lines; the master is a real eminent monk, Master Kaizhao who has been preaching Buddhism to death row prisoners for more than 30 years. , and there is no script. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Kangren and the director performed the scene more than thirty times, trying to understand why Abang had such a strong reaction to release himself in such a situation. &quot;We can imagine that he will have a display of strength in the end, but we didn&#39;t understand where the base point of strength is.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/11/25/PnousbgA6PNRLpQfUXmEoJ692wqpfd4Yaarsu6IS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/ 25/PnousbgA6PNRLpQfUXmEoJ692wqpfd4Yaarsu6IS.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259641&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Fudu Youth (2023) &lt;span style=&quot;color: # aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the long preparation period and the shooting in chronological order, the actors have enough time to integrate into the characters, so when Wu Kangren heard Master Kaizhao say &quot;live well&quot; , suddenly mourning Abang endlessly. &quot;Living well is the most difficult thing for him. What seems simple to us is a luxury for them. So we must start from this sentence.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Abang and Adi cannot rent The house often wakes up from sleep in the middle of the night to avoid inspection; it is impossible to open a bank account, and all the working money is kept in a rusty cookie box; I cannot buy a motorcycle because I cannot get a driver&#39;s license, so I can only take the bus or walk everywhere. Without status, they will always be forced to work as laborers in Fudu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Abang once encountered love, but it was fleeting; he once thought he could live a stable life with his brother in Fudu, but his fate overturned it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But they also had their happy moments. Abang, Adi and Sister Money, a transgender person, depend on each other - in Malaysia, transgender people have no identity in another sense - they eat together and dance together. Three people hit their heads with eggs at the dinner table, screaming and laughing in pain. This is Wu Kangren&#39;s favorite scene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I think the most precious thing is the smiles in life. Throughout the play, they rarely smile, and the things that are taken for granted in life are too harsh for them.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, Facing Master Kaizhao, Abang complained: I always wonder why I was born, I have no home, I don’t even have parents, I can only watch from a distance. I&#39;m jealous of you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I want to be like you. But I can&#39;t! Why is this? I want to talk, I want to be loved, to be liked, but there is nothing. You told me not to give up, to keep living. But I can&#39;t do it at all. I always have to be careful, alert, hiding, running away. It&#39;s not fair, I did something wrong.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;My life is terrible and I want to change my life, but Impossible. I have no future.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These accusations were made in sign language and facial expressions. The expressions on those who carefully observed the surroundings, the echo of the wrist chain hitting the table, and the tears that had been rolling in the eye sockets for a long time but did not fall, all made this silent accusation deafening. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Don&#39;t preach to me, I have no identity.&quot; Abang pointed to the code on his prison uniform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Master Kaizhao suddenly held Abang’s hand. Abang calmed down, tears fell, and he sobbing a difficult syllable: &quot;I want to die, I want to die, I think ...&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He looked around and found that no one could understand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Abang is dumb, which is a coupling of fate. &quot;A group of people without identity, like dumb, will not change even if they speak.&quot; Wu Kangren said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Chen Zeyao, who played his brother, later saw this silent complaint on the screen, and was shocked and hurt. &quot;It turned out that Abang thought so, it turned out that he had always felt like a shadow. I couldn&#39;t help you with you Say too much inner feelings, because my heart is really painful. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Brother&#39;s farewell to that scene, Chen Zeyao instinctively expressed his emotions to his brother in sign language. &quot;I&#39;m crying, and forgot to mystery. Later, I found that everyone can feel it without talking about the lines.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &quot;Abang, next time, I said next time, I would like to protect you.&quot; Adi said. Twenty years ago, the stray Abon and Adi met on the street and became brothers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For Wang Lilin, the &quot;Fugu Youth&quot; presenting today has achieved his expectations. &quot;I want to talk about people&#39;s emotions in the context of Fudu foreign workers. In such a cruel and oppressed society, the precious warmth and goodwill between people.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; What are the expectations of &quot;Fudu Youth&quot;? &quot;We asked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Don&#39;t lose money, they are so hard to shoot a film.&quot; He answered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The next day, Wu Kangren sent a social media: &quot;We did a great thing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/ CMS/MEDIAS/Image/23/11/25/1MJ220voe9o4Tyiqivik3kr0r0ye1alckh7wtsqflg.jpg &quot;Border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 686 &quot;height =&quot; 960 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images. infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/11/25/1mj220voe9o4tyqivik3kr0ye1alckh7wtsqflg.jpg &quot;data-key =&quot; 259642 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999; text-align: center; &quot;>; &lt;span style = &quot;color: #aaa; &quot;>; (Wu Kuangren&#39;s personal social media account/picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong>; Clap &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In 2016, Wu Kuangren relied on&quot; A Blue &quot; The corner of &quot;Guo Yan&quot; won the Golden Bell Award for Best Actor. This is one of his most successful characters. He is mixed with the cynical sense of youth and vicissitudes of the life and death of war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; His award -winning speech seems to be pleading: pleading for actors more resources, and begging for TV stations to develop more different types of dramas. &quot;They (actors) are waiting, as before, waiting for me to choose me like Cao Ruiyuan&#39;s eyes, we need a little more resources to help us. Maybe we are not the most talented, but we can always be the most.

After 2019, the episodes represented by &quot;The distance between us to evil&quot; and concerned about social issues marked that the Taiwanese drama basically spent the low valley period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the above -mentioned Taiwanese dramas, Wu Kuangren all picked up the beam. From idol dramas to realism, his acting career has overlap with the ups and downs and changes in the 15 years of platform dramas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;In terms of honesty, I would become famous because Taiwan was very lacking (filming) at that time. Taiwanese actors were not much at my age.&quot; He said in an interview with &quot;Taiwan Scales&quot; at the end of 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When entering the industry, he believes that he is not good in appearance and qualifications, but &quot;effort is more important than talent.&quot; When he was doing wine insurance, he would not speak English. After finishing work in the early morning, he went to the Eslite Bookstore, which was opened overnight. Many years later, the media went to interview the owner of the bar, and the other party used &quot;life to hang life&quot; to describe Wu Kangren: to work hard for one thing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He has experienced a negative stage. He knew what he was doing, he paid 200 %, and he was strict with himself, and asked the people around him to work as hard as him. &quot;I used to be quite aggressive at work, so there will be rumors that Wu Kangren is difficult to engage. I only slowly realized in the past two years. This is a team work.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; But because Wu Kuangren always emphasizes efforts, It is often said that they are not talented, and few people talk about his talent as an actor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He has beautiful eyes, and his eyebrows are affectionate, so he is good at performing the explosive moment of complex emotions; he is long than observation, and he describes many details of the old districts of Fudu. Although he is daily and serious, standing on the stage and in front of the camera, he has a lot of words and humor, and his expression and physical movements are rich. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He is confident that he can persist in acting, yearn for a good actor like Li Xuejian, but not optimistic about the actor&#39;s career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;I don&#39;t think I have always had a play, I want to contact a lot of possibilities earlier and faster. It may not be possible to perform a film in the future, and strive to strive for fate.&quot; He thought for a while, &quot;You won&#39;t see&quot; Fugu Youth &quot;in five years. I have entered the industry for 15 years, and I saw&quot; Fudu Youth &quot;.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; This is then It was why he tried a variety of unconventional characters after 2015. He wanted to know how much possibilities he had, and how to improve the performance. He went to the training class to practice vocal skills; he filmed 5 plays in 2022, and he was very solid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Perhaps because there is no agent, the film resources that Wu Kangren can come into contact with is limited. He has expressed his love for mainland art films several times, and admits that he has respected to the mainland to act in the mainland. &quot;Before you go, you have to prepare for it, not to make money.&quot; Without the agent, Wu Kangren&#39;s work decision was made by himself. After gone through a panic, he is now used to this way of working: he knows what is important, and he only needs to play a good show. He can take care of himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He yearn for Hong Kong actors in the golden age of Hong Kong films, such as Liang Jiahui, Liang Chaowei, and Andy Lau. &quot;Each actor has accumulated hundreds of dramas and leaves his own position.&quot; >; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/3ps1fpdk7zj6bsxs9jb3qbmfyu7ayjgorhx.jpg&quot; width = &quot;960&quot; width = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot;960 &quot;Height =&quot; 1440 &quot;data-SRC = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/3ps1fpdk7zj6bsxs9jb3qbmfyu7ayjgorhx.jpg =&quot; 259647 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; Co &quot;Co Lor: #999; Text- Align: center; &quot;>; The year of life (2023) &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The title of&quot; Life &quot;is Gao Jiayue&#39;s life summary.

At that time, due to the Anti -Japanese War, Teng Chong had a rubble in the city, and there was almost no standing house in the city. The central elementary school we read is the temple. Previously, the Japanese used it as the headquarters. Because of the strong architecture, it was stored. There were still many bullet holes on the wall pillars inside. I studied in the sixth grade school to repair the sports field, and I also dug a lot of bullet shells and bayonets for three -eighth rifle.

At that time, I read Lin Hansda&#39;s &quot;New Zhou Story of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty&quot;, &quot;New Editor of the Han Story&quot;, &quot;The Story of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, &quot;The Tai Shi who is not afraid of death&quot;, etc., and has a strong interest in history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, Kaiti_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; History of Yunnan University? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Lin Chaomin: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; My father is a technician engaged in water conservancy projects, participating in the construction Road, ditch, and reservoirs often tell me that New China has been established. The motherland needs to be industrialized. You have to go to the study of engineering and work for modernization. My mother is a middle school teacher. In 1957, many liberal arts teachers were wronged by Tengchong No. 1 Middle School. My mother said that she could not learn arts and it was easy to make mistakes. Therefore, I always wanted to study science and engineering. Later, my mother also advocated that I was studying medicine because it was useful at any time. In high school, we were good in all subjects, but it was more prominent in liberal arts. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In 1962, I was in high school. After graduating from the last semester, the school divided us into three groups according to our subjects. The other group is medical and agricultural department, and the other is liberal arts. My family decided to choose a science and engineering department, but in the specific division, I was assigned to the liberal arts group under the arrangement of the class teacher, Chinese teacher, and historical teacher. At that time, I went to Baoshan, Yunnan to take the college entrance examination, and issued a volunteer book before the exam. Everyone can fill in five volunteers, and I have filled the historical departments of Peking University, Renmin University of China, Nanjing University, Fudan and Yunda, and was later accepted to Yunda. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, Kaiti_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; Is the history department &quot;five years&quot;? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Lin Chaomin: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; Our historical department has only one major in history, recruiting 32 people. Only one -half of the previous session, one third of the previous session. The curriculum arrangements are basic courses in the first, second, and third grades, such as ancient literature, politics, foreign languages, Chinese and foreign history, etc. The fourth grade is divided into &quot;specialization (group)&quot;. When I was studying, there were three specialized groups: Chinese national history, ancient Chinese economy history, and modern Chinese economic history. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; At that time, he did not study well at the time. Since 1958, there have been more labor education in universities. The central government has formulated sixty articles in Gao Education, emphasizing teaching. At that time, the Ministry of Education stipulated that the student had to take a labor class in a school year, which was five weeks, and it could not exceed five weeks. But in fact, the labor of each school year is more than five weeks. At that time, there were three farms in Yunnan University, breeding rice, buds, wheat, vegetables, and Apple Parks, pig farms. In addition, there are many public welfare labor, such as planting trees on the mountain. When farmers are busy, they support the spring plowing and autumn harvest. Later, Kunming repairing the train station and calling us to help. By 1961, after investigating the Ministry of Higher Education, I felt that students had to do labor and go to school. In less than 4 years, they were less than much to learn. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; Mr.? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Lin Chaomin: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; When I was in college, Mr. Fang undertook the compilation of the southwest part of the national task of China. He only brought graduate students. The national history is a high -grade professional course. The fourth grade is only taught by Mr. You Zhong and Mr. Mu Qin. On April 20, 1963, Mr. Fang gave a speech at the school &quot;On the overallness of the development of Chinese history&quot;. I first met him for the first time, but because he was a Lijiang, the Naxi people, the accent was very heavy, and he didn&#39;t understand much. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; But I was impressed after reading the article. In September 1966, I was studying in the senior year because the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; stopped class. The school began to criticize a large criticism and criticize reactionary academic authority. At that time, Yunda established a large critical team. There was a Chinese group and a historical group below. The historical group mainly criticized the &quot;three big mountains&quot; of the historical department. Jiang Yingliang, who represents &quot;bureaucratic capitalism, once served as the county head in the car, is now Jinghong), and the third is Yang Yan, the&quot; representative &quot;imperialist (representative of Lyon University in France). I have five or six classmates in the historical group. We have 20 borrowing cards in the critical team, and we can enter the library to check the books and read books. At this time, I found all Mr. Fang&#39;s discussion and read it again. His &quot;Inspection of Western Yunnan&quot; told him to go to Aya Mountain in Lincang to do field inspections. Very good, I didn&#39;t find any problems. I didn&#39;t write an article that criticized Mr. Fang. Instead, he has learned the social history of the frontier, the ethnic minority customs and customs, and feel that his &quot;On the Plateralness of the Development of Chinese History&quot; is a good article to maintain the unity of the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;Fang Guoyu (first from the left) in guiding Lin Chaoyong (second from left), in the study of Professor Fang Guoyu in March 1973.

The course has a large demand for employment. All students from modern history have been distributed to the General Political Department of the PLA. In addition, there are many people who go to the Ministry of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (now the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences). At that time, Yunda&#39;s national history was the first in the country. The Ministry of Philosophy and Social Sciences studied the history of the Dai people, the history of Yi, the history of the Bai, and the history of the Naxi ethnic group. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; It should be aore to graduate in July 1967, but until October 1968, our group of college students except agriculture and medicine. Outside of majors, all were arranged to go to the farm for re -education and labor exercise. The distribution did not begin in April 1970. At that time, it was stipulated that college students should achieve &quot;four faces&quot;, facing grassroots, rural areas, industrial and mining, and facing the frontiers. During the distribution, no one was willing to go to Xishuangbanna. I have read Mr. Fang&#39;s &quot;Inspection of the West of Yunnan&quot;, Mr. Jiang Yingliang&#39;s &quot;Economic Life of Economic Life&quot; and &quot;Culture of Life Culture&quot;. Actively sign up to Xishuangbanna. In May 1970, when I arrived at Erhai County, Xishuangbanna, I was assigned to the Erhai Tea Factory as a worker. In 1972, Erhai No.1 Middle School founded a high school and needed high school teachers, but the factory did not let it go.

I read Houwai&#39;s &quot;The History of Chinese Thought&quot;, Zhao Jibin&#39;s &quot;New Exploration of the Analects of Confucius&quot;, Guo Moruo&#39;s &quot;Ten Critical Books&quot;, etc. I took notes. When I went to Erhai, I brought a &quot;Four Books&quot;. I wrote an article about Confucius&#39; thoughts in my spare time. Professor Li Yan in the department asked him to enlighten him. He handed the article to an expert in ancient Chinese thought, Professor Zhang Deguang, and Mr. Zhang recommended it to Ren Jiyu. Mr. Ren gave me a letter saying that in the remote place in Xishuangbanna, I could insist on studying Confucius, and it was not easy to write such an article, but he also proposed that my article was not enough to criticize Confucius. Mr. Ren also sent me a copy of his editor -in -chief of the History of Chinese Philosophy. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In 1972, Mr. Ren wrote to me and told me to recruit 10 graduate students in the history of Chinese philosophy.

However, Zhang Tiesheng had a white volume incident. Mr. Ren wrote to tell me that the postgraduate enrollment work stopped. In the future, the recruitment and research students must also implement the method of recommending workers, peasants and soldiers.

Some students asked me about the question of ethnic minorities. At this time, I remembered the research of Mr. Fang Guoyu and Mr. Jiang Yingliang&#39;s ethnic minorities.

The article treats some scholars at home and abroad as a single Han history, excluding the history of the non -Han ethnic minorities in the absurd remarks of the history of the Chinese ethnic minorities, pointing out that the development of Chinese history is always a whole, history and reality, Central Plains and the Central Plains and the Central Plains The frontier, Han and ethnic minorities, and the Chinese nation are all the whole. Chinese history refers to the history of living people living on this land, which should include all their history, and cannot &quot;change the telescopic&quot;.

At the 70th anniversary of Yunnan University in 1983, he also instructed me to write an article called &quot;Several Issues Related to Dali 37 Alliance Oaths&quot;, which also talked about the unified problem of Chinese history through this monument. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, Kaiti_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; Some historians may still hold some other views on the unified historical outlook.

There was no border problem in China before. Only the relationship between Huaxia and Siyi was that Huaxia and Siyi &quot;the five parties&quot; and &quot;the world unified, Huayi Infernal Affairs&quot; was a whole from central to local. Even in the division period, regardless of the Han noodles and ethnic minorities, they pursue the &quot;unity of the world&quot; and regard the dynasties they have established as the orthodox of China. Economic, political, and cultural structure. Because of the long -term common life of all nations, it has long formed a complementary and unified production lifestyle, breeding the Chinese civilization with very inclusive and absorbing, making the Chinese nation form a strong internal agglomeration based on &quot;commonality&quot;. Even during the division period, this production lifestyle has not changed, the political system has not changed, the overall consciousness has not changed, and the culture has been continuing. This is the national view of the &quot;unification&quot; and the overall consciousness of the Chinese nation in the national view and national view. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Modern border research has begun to rise because of the east of Western colonialism. The first is the &quot;frontier&quot; in politics. Many places in history are divided into a process of development. For example, Yunnan was Nanzhao in the Tang Dynasty. In the tenth year of Zhenyuan (794), the Yunnan Activity Division was established. It is a local regime. Dali is also a local regime of autonomy. In 1253, Mongolia was settled in Dali. In 1274, the Yuan Dynasty established a province in Yunnan. The Yuan Dynasty also established a Burmese province, and later was placed under the management of Yunnan Province. It is a toast land in Yunnan Province. After the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China, in 1961, the border between China and Myanmar was officially determined. China erected the first monument of the People&#39;s Republic of China on the border of Tengchong. It means that we formally respect the boundary of international law, which is the frontier in international law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; and the culture of the culture, such as the culture of the Chinese Dai people and the culture of northern Myanmar. At this time, although there is a political boundary, But in fact, everyone&#39;s culture and history are the community of destiny. Therefore, from the country, the overall nature of the Chinese nation should be regarded as a community from abroad. In China, we maintain China&#39;s overallness and national unity. Internationally, we build a community of human destiny. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;Lin Chaomin&#39;s doctoral dissertation entitled&quot; The Anti -Bei Tingdu Mansion and the Western Border of the Tang Dynasty &quot;, taken in 1985.

I told the students that the classroom tables, chairs, benches, doors and windows, and electric lights are useful, but this space is not available, but without this space, tables, chairs, benches, and electric lights have nowhere to place them. History is human time and space. I can&#39;t see it, I can&#39;t touch it, but it can&#39;t be separated at all times, and it is useful anytime, anywhere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Later In 5 days, I filled out the application form every night and stated at the review meeting that Yunnan University is a frontier university, and many aspects are not as good as Peking University and Fudan. National unity is irreplaceable by other schools. The characteristics of Yunda History are the frontiers and ethnic groups, and no school cannot be replaced. In this way, in 1987, Yun Da became one of the 10 bases. The base class has brought new opportunities to Yunda. The state invests 300,000 construction funds for the base class each year, and more than half of students can be used to pay for study.

The Education Commission of Yunnan Province, the Education Commission said that the ethnic academy was run by the National Academy. One province should not have two ethnic ministries, but in the end, it was not completed. Later, I rewritten the report to apply for the establishment of an anthropology. In 1987, the State Education Commission approved Yunda to open a human major. We are the second anthropology major in national universities. The first one is Xiamen University, and the first one is the Department of Anthropology. In 1988, we recruited the first batch of undergraduates. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; After the Antharmaceutic specialty in 1988, I started planning to apply for sociology. In July 1939, Wu Wenzao founded the Department of Sociology at Yunda. By 1954, the Department of Sociology was revoked. At that time, the director of the department was Mr. Yang Yan. In 1984 and 1986, I visited Mr. Yang twice in the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. I brought his opinions back to the school and reported to the leaders. Although I was ignored, I kept in my heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In October 1990, I visited the United States to study. I know that social work majors are a professional in society. Social development will bring many problems. Social workers come to deal with solutions. No matter the poor and the rich have social problems. After returning to China, I went to some universities to learn about social work. A characteristic of their social work is to help vulnerable groups, help poor people, unemployed, disabled people, etc. I told the school when I came back. Social work major. At that time, most people at the School Academic Affairs Office did not know what social work was, and I explained over and over again.

Four years later, at the age of 16, she fulfilled her promise with practical actions and became the youngest person in China to climb Mount Everest from the south slope. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Influenced by her father, Xu Zhuoyuan started climbing when she was very young. When she was 4 years old, her parents took her to climb Mount Siguniang and unexpectedly found that she adapted well to altitude sickness. When she was 12 years old, she traveled to Tibet with her father Xu Jianglei. At that time, she regretted not being able to see the sunrise on Mount Everest due to weather conditions. On the way back, she climbed the peak of Mount Siguniang with her father. “It was my first time to climb a snow-capped mountain in a real sense.” From then on, she buried her desire to climb Mount Everest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mountain climbing is an extreme sport that relies on luck. Since she got into climbing, her mood has become more stable. &quot;People often die during climbing. Now for me, life and death are no big deal.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;This climb six months ago was Xu Zhuoyuan’s first challenge on Mount Everest. Before setting off, she packed her father Xu Jianglei&#39;s gloves when he climbed Mount Everest into his backpack, hoping to keep them as &quot;a kind of inheritance.&quot; In 2007, Xu Jianglei climbed to the summit of Mount Everest, becoming the first person in Hunan Province to summit Mount Everest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Zhuoyuan remembered that when she was approaching the summit, the Sherpa guide beside her reminded her that she was almost at the top and it was still dark. &quot;The only thought in my mind was that I must see the top of Mount Everest.&quot; At sunrise on the mountain, my father’s summit photo has always impressed me. In the photo, he is high-spirited and smiling brightly facing the sun. I can feel his love for the snow-capped mountains. That photo is still displayed in my home. .&quot; Fortunately, the sun came out almost at the moment she reached the top. Now, next to a picture of her father, there is a picture of her reaching the summit, with the rising sun behind her. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;I want to climb Mount Everest&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot; >;When you were 12 years old, you said &quot;I want to climb Mount Everest&quot; on a show. What did you think at the time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>; Ever since I was a child, Mount Everest has always had a different meaning to me. The summer after I graduated from primary school when I was 12 years old, my father took me to Tibet, but I didn’t see the Rizhao Jinshan Mountain due to the weather. Later, my father and I went to climb the peak of Siguniang Mountain together. This was my first time to truly climb a snow-capped mountain. It snowed on the mountain at that time. As a southerner, I found it very novel. From then on, I very much hoped to have the opportunity to climb Mount Everest to watch the sunrise. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After setting that goal at the age of 12, my father How to say? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;He was quite shocked at the time.

It is indeed difficult to balance them, but if you really love it, you will try your best. All ways to balance. My current high school coursework is very heavy, and my mountaineering training is also very heavy, so I will fill up all my free time and study ahead of schedule. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Climbing to the top is not success, returning home is&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How did you feel when you climbed to the top of Mount Everest? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I thought I would be very excited. Climbing to the top would be regarded as fulfilling my dream of the past four years, but I didn’t know it was because the weather was too bad at that time. Cold and high altitude can compress some of people&#39;s emotions, but I&#39;m actually quite calm. I remember taking out the flags in my bag one by one, taking pictures, and then calling my mother to report that everything was safe. Because the weather was so bad and there was a heavy snowstorm, the Sherpa guide urged me to retreat quickly, so I thought about retreating quickly. At that time, my parents suggested that I stay at Camp 2 for one more day and take a helicopter back to Everest Base Camp the next day. But I stayed on the mountain for 8 days. I didn’t take a shower or have an Internet connection for 8 days. This actually reached the limit for me. I threw my sleeping bag and moisture-proof mat directly to Camp 4 and decided to return to the base camp that day. , so it took me 22 hours to withdraw that day. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In addition to not being able to take a shower, as a girl, you What difficulties did you encounter during the climb? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In fact, women have more inconveniences when climbing than men, such as washing and going to the toilet. But both men and women are equal in front of the mountain, but women have to work harder to achieve this goal. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the 8 days without the Internet, you have nothing but What are you doing for training? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>; Mainly training. We adapted to Camp 2 for 3 days, and then we were waiting for news from Camp 3 to see the road construction team. Can it be cultivated to the top? We were very lucky. If the road construction team had not repaired it at that time, we might have to withdraw to the Everest base camp and wait for the next cycle. The rest of the time, I would chat with my teammates on the mountaineering team, play cards, and fight against altitude sickness. I vomited violently the night I first arrived at Everest Base Camp. I don’t know if it was because I was not used to the climate in Nepal, so I rested for about two days before recovering. Later, I was training alone with my teammates at the base camp. My mother called me and advised me to withdraw. So this is also my first time to climb a mountain without my parents. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Didn’t you think about withdrawing it at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Maybe I am a bit stubborn, thinking that I have suffered so much and have to climb so many snow-capped mountains in one day before climbing Mount Everest.

Feeling humiliated and excited at the same time, he opened the first page of the computer document and read &quot;Mistake by the River&quot; in enlarged font size. Below it were two lines of small characters, original work: Yu Hua, director: Wei Shujun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He wants to adapt this novella published in 1988. The perpetrators of the three murders all pointed to madmen, but they could not build a complete chain of evidence to bring him to justice, which made both the town and the criminal police captain Ma Zhe uneasy. Writer Yu Hua&#39;s parody of detective novels in the avant-garde literature period used violent absurdity as the surface and subversion of tradition as the core. I have sold the copyright several times but have never changed it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The difficult thing is to find a word that points to the philosophy behind all suspenseful stories. In 2021, Wei Shujun and screenwriter Kang Chunlei entered the second year of their adaptation. After overturning the general direction twice, they were determined to find the word. They searched for two days and two nights, wandering around the house until they got something. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Bug.&quot; He was quite satisfied with this new development. &quot;It is a word born from the progress of information technology. It is a vulnerability problem based on code and the best rational logic. We think it is too accurate. , isn&#39;t our &quot;Yong&#39;an Town Story Collection&quot; called &#39;Ripples of Life&#39;, this one is called &#39;Bugs of Life&#39;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was August 2021, and Wei Shujun was preparing to shoot a new film in Northeast China &quot;White Crane Spreads Wings&quot;. After work, the crew plays badminton together. However, indoor venues have been closed due to the new crown epidemic, and they are planning to play basketball outdoors instead. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A month ago, his second feature film &quot;The Story of Yong&#39;an Town&quot; was selected for the Directors&#39; Fortnight section of the Cannes Film Festival; a year ago, his first feature film &quot;Wild Horse Parting Mane&quot; was nominated for the Cannes Newcomer Award. As a feature film director, his graduate work &quot;Yanbian Boy&quot; won the Cannes Short Film Special Mention Award. He received critical acclaim when he first appeared on the scene. Industry seniors and critics praised his talents and talents, and were curious about the possibilities he brought to the table. sex. Wei Shujun received attention as a result. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the adaptation of &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; quickly fell into another strange circle. Bugs do not exist alone. To describe rational loopholes and loss of control, the premise is to explain what rationality is. The argument about rationality is a wide-ranging, academic discussion that is energy-consuming and unnecessary. &quot;We looked in the wrong direction again,&quot; we had to give up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By chance, while scouting locations in Hangzhou, Wei Shujun felt that there should be a dream at the end of the story. &quot;The causes of their deaths are not completely connected on a rational level and cannot serve to solve the case. But in the dream, they interlock with each other, as if they are all established, revealing a certain inevitability in a series of accidents, giving people a creepy feeling.&quot; In the final version of the script, dreams became the core sequence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This seems to be his consistent creative approach, which values ​​the true feelings of the creative subject and expresses them effectively in the film. Photography director Cheng Ma, who has worked with him three times, provided evidence: &quot;We basically create based on our feelings.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cheng Ma and Wei Shujun met for the first time in Shanghai three years ago, and they chatted quite well. . They have many consensuses on the nature and creative concepts of movies, two of which are simple but very important: movies were created to create &quot;realistic illusions&quot; at the beginning, and they should still be so today, and movies may not be the best way to tell stories. It is a medium, but it is a channel for storing and transmitting the creator’s feelings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, regarding &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot;, Wei Shujun told Cheng Ma that it was restrained, quiet, and elegant, and that many things happened on a humid and rainy day. This was how he felt when reading the novel. Accordingly, Cheng Ma felt that the images should be consistent with the 1990s, when the characters were wandering and out of place, and geographical features such as counties or towns were far away, not close. Cheng Ma suggested shooting on 16mm film, and they hit it off immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In November 2022, with 45 days left before filming, the crew arrived in Nanfeng, Jiangxi Province, where the filming took place, to make preparations. The actors were busy with their own work. Tong Linkai had to practice splits and back fists. Zhu Yilong wore a leather jacket to visit the local police and gained 30 pounds to achieve an overworked figure. Zeng Meihuizi was also making herself gain weight in order to look like a pregnant woman. The crew cooked together, watched movies, and played badminton. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I think the best state of creation is when all the main creators are relaxed. I don’t like that kind of tense, night-and-night (state) like a repair project, which is very tiring. That is to say, although it is You are working, but you still have your own life order, and you still retain your pursuit of beauty and passion for life.&quot; Wei Shujun said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He often carries a film camera with him - the crew has a total of more than 20 film cameras, and even a darkroom for developing black and white photos - to capture the daily life of the crew. There are more saved in his mobile phone photo album. When he opens it and looks through it, he sees friends meeting, travel scenes, rivers, trees, and the sea. “It seems to have some kind of ability to preserve time, making you think of it as a pleasant time.” In the afternoon, a happy state.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relaxation is rare. What is also rare is that, in Cheng Ma&#39;s words, Wei Shujun places a particularly high importance on creation. &quot;As a director of his age, he can actually withstand a lot of pressure. We have to shoot smoothly, but many people ask us what to do with the scenes and what to do with the actors&#39; time. For example, a certain role has many scenes, but the actors can only come for 10 days in total. , the usual approach of the crew is to focus on filming all his scenes in these 10 days. But Wei Shujun feels that smooth filming is of great value to his creation, so he will give up scenes that cannot be matched by actors or at inappropriate times.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kang Chunlei also said: &quot;I think he has an almost intuitive ability to control the scene. I always told him, you shine on the scene.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also Once, Wei Shujun changed his character&#39;s name on the spot. In the novel, Ma Zhe&#39;s subordinate is Xiao Li, a young man who takes the initiative to report case analysis from time to time. So of course Tong Linkai’s name is Xiao Li. After a few days of filming, Wei Shujun suddenly said, thank you so much &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (&quot;Thanks&quot; means shit)&lt;/span>;, don&#39;t call me Xiao Li. Just call me Xiao Xie. Wei Shujun greeted other actors and revised his lines. The printed police officer ID card of Xiao Li was re-attached. Tong Linkai&#39;s role became Xiao Xie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But to be honest, the feeling at the scene was not that wonderful. Wei Shujun&#39;s own version is: &quot;Imagine that when you were in school, you had to sit in the classroom at 7 a.m. every morning to study early. On the way from home after breakfast, you felt that you were still waking up. When you got to class, you thought about writing yesterday&#39;s homework. No, I didn’t write it, so I wrote it quickly. After I wrote it, I felt very at ease. I started to think about going to the canteen to buy something to eat during recess, and then I went to the actual class to listen to the teacher. It was the same on the set, everyone was here, Shui After brewing it, we started drinking water. We walked around the scene and the actors were almost done. Then we discussed the scene and confirmed our schedule with the photographer. Everyone prepared individually and then started to prepare for shooting. If something didn’t feel right in the first two days, Adjust it, and it feels good. If you take a few more shots, it will be time for lunch. It really feels like this.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There is a slope every day, and you have to climb up a slope. You have to crawl over to get to that position.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; was completed accurately and efficiently, and was shortlisted for the &quot;Un Certain Regard&quot; section of the Cannes Film Festival. Five months later, it won two honors: Best Film and Cinephile Choice at the Pingyao International Film Festival. After another four days, it was released nationwide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the film, there was often chatter in the theater. Wei Shujun used a long dream to allow Ma Zhe to reveal himself in order to resolve his own uneasiness and chaos. The dream was clear, coherent but illogical. After witnessing everyone&#39;s death by the river, Ma Zhe sat on an old cinema seat and saw the director on the big screen holding a ping pong ball with the number 3 printed on it, shouting at him. ——Ma Zhe! Third class merit! In this shot where conjecture and prophecy overlap, thousands of ping pong balls roll down from the bottom of the screen and swarm towards Ma Zhe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone was very excited during the shooting. After taking one shot, everyone picked up the thousands of ping pong balls while shouting &quot;One more, another one&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the show, the audience was full of doubts and endless interpretations and comments about the film, forming multiple dreams outside the screen, a kind of &quot;rationality and irrationality, the combination of the viewer and the viewer.&quot; effect&quot;. From this perspective, Wei Shujun&#39;s initial uneasiness when reading the novel, his exploration of the creator&#39;s intentions, and his several elusive moments during the adaptation were all conveyed to the audience. We think we have the answer, but in fact we have the illusion of an answer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I am not too obsessed with pursuing the truth in life, because I feel that it is difficult to find it.&quot; Cheng Ma said that this is another consensus between him and Wei Shujun that the truth is difficult to find, &quot;the so-called The fate of your life is a random existence. You can only see its existence and don’t know the truth behind it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The slight existentialist tendency of &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; is just that Back to &quot;existence precedes essence&quot;, or in other words, &quot;back to the thing itself&quot;.

As a tribute to the centenary, &quot;Star Wish&quot; certainly closely follows this theme. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The background of the movie is set in a kingdom of wishes called Rosas. People come from all directions to offer their dreams to the magical King Manifico, and the king will choose the right person from them. Help them achieve it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The heroine Yasha’s biggest wish is that her grandfather’s dream comes true. However, when she came into contact with King Manifico, she realized that &lt;span>; the king was not as kind and generous as he appeared on the surface. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/13d838d9212ca2dcc2eb87255e9f04b0.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/13d838d9212ca2dcc2eb87255e9f04b0.png&quot; data-key=&quot;259601 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Manifico is an extreme conservative. He will only select dreams that he considers harmless to realize, while shelving creative dreams. He regarded such dreams as a scourge that would shake Rosas&#39;s foundations. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Of course Asha disagrees with the king&#39;s point of view, so she joins forces with the wishing star and Valentino the goat to try to get her grandfather&#39;s dream back.

And &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;No matter what the situation, Asha was always loyal to her heart, &lt;/span>; and won more allies, and finally overthrew Manifico&#39;s rule. The dystopian nature of the movie is very un-Disney. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I don&#39;t agree with your point of view, but I will defend to the death your right to speak.&quot; Putting it here is an excellent comment. Everyone has the right to pursue their dreams, and the king cannot deny it easily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to being good at creating dreams, Disney is also good at creating princesses. Since the release of Snow White (Disney&#39;s first animated feature film &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;) in 1937, Disney has followed the development of the times for more than 80 years and successively launched more than a dozen characters.

The family relationship between the two sisters became the main thread, and the handsome prince became the villain of the entire film. The princess no longer passively waits for the prince to save her, the princess herself is very powerful; true love no longer involves the prince kissing the princess, and the sisterhood is also very touching. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/c1da20b56f8dbd4531cb0b088ba7c214.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;418&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/c1da20b56f8dbd4531cb0b088ba7c214.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259606 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It can be said that Disney subverted Disney. Starting from this&lt;/span>;movie, Disney princesses completely got rid of the male gaze. They took off their costumes and became their own heroes. Like the &lt;span>; princesses in &quot;Moana&quot; (2016) and &quot;Legend of the Dragon&quot; (2021), they all gave up on romance. One lived her life how she wanted, and the other led her people to protect their home and country. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/0c8e54ba1a97dd0ceb9f0f15dd4a0e8d.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;224&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/0c8e54ba1a97dd0ceb9f0f15dd4a0e8d.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;259607 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;And this &quot;Star Wish&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; is also of the same origin&lt;/span>;. Asha dares to question and is not afraid of power. In order to protect all the residents of Rosas He did not hesitate to stand on the opposite side of King Manifico. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But compared with the previous princesses, Asha&#39;s combat effectiveness is obviously weakened. She no longer has the ability to go to heaven and earth. She is more like an ordinary person, a civilian hero who resists the aloof king. Just like the theme song of the movie sings, &quot;Maybe you are afraid but you still reach out your hand, and you will not run away because of a weak tremor.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This may also be the century-old road that Disney has walked for itself. Write down &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;’s sincere notes&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;: &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;If you don’t forget your original intention and hold your dreams in mind, you can always get through the twists and turns of the river&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/9dc306addaa0bd973987160fd8f00c69.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; OPACITY: 1; &quot;Width =&quot; 1080 &quot;Height =&quot; 423 &quot;Data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/9dc306addaa0bd97397160fd8f00c69.j.j.j.j. peg &quot;data-key =&quot; 259608 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 25 Nov 2023 22:25:05 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
