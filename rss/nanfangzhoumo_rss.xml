From 760,000 in 2018, it surged to 1.25 million last year, more than 60%. During the same period, the number of people taking the postgraduate entrance examination more than doubled from 2.38 million to 4.57 million. About 70% of those who fail the postgraduate entrance exam every year will face fiercer competition next year if they choose to retake the exam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other examination rooms, the situation is similar. The number of people recruiting civil servants and public servants across the country has increased significantly, and the number of applicants has also skyrocketed. No matter which examination room young people rush to after graduation, they will face fierce competition that is no less fierce than the college entrance examination. The accumulation of consecutive losers has become a rich source of stories for the media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, Sanlian Life Weekly’s article “Five Years Trapped in the Postgraduate Entrance Examination and Editorial Examination” interviewed a person who took the postgraduate entrance examination, the public examination and the editor examination continuously. According to the narrator, she felt that the major she studied at university had no future in work, and her family worshiped academic qualifications, so she took the postgraduate entrance examination every year, and also took the public and editing examinations at the same time, which lasted for five years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After failing the five-year exam, this girl had to enter the workplace under financial pressure. She realized that although her new job was hard, it was at least &quot;possible&quot; and that her classmates who &quot;went ashore&quot; were actually not doing much better. But by the end of the article, this girl still couldn&#39;t forget it and was still taking the exam in September this year. Just when the reader thinks there is a bright future and the spiritual internal friction is coming to an end, everything returns to the starting point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many full-time exam takers today spend a lot of time and energy just to gain some uncertain advantages in the future. In terms of postgraduate entrance examinations, although a master&#39;s degree has some advantages over a bachelor&#39;s degree in the workplace, the advantages are actually limited considering the age factor. Those who work hard for the &quot;iron rice bowl&quot; seem to be very good, but the career path of most positions is narrow, the income is not high, and it is difficult to change jobs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to postgraduate entrance examinations, public examinations and editing examinations, there is also a large group of &quot;teacher examinations&quot;. In 2022, more than 11 million people will take the teacher qualification examination. Many people take the test for everything, whether they like it or not. They continue to take exams all year round, but in order to find a decent and stable job, these jobs are basically within the system, with poor mobility and difficulty in changing jobs, but they are better than &quot;stability&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Spending a lot of time and energy on a huge gamble in life is deplorable in my opinion. At the age when life is the most energetic, you hide in a study in a small building and study hard to prepare for exams. You do not create value, do not learn knowledge and skills, and you cannot even enjoy happiness. Is it really worth it to have a stable job in the future? Moreover, most people are destined to fail and become the denominator rather than the numerator. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On social media and exam forums, this kind of day is &quot;inspirational&quot;. Many people stick together to keep each other warm, and even if others disagree, it seems difficult to criticize them: everyone has a different path, and the choice does not matter whether it is high or low, right? There are more and more people taking vocational exams, which is related to the employment environment and this atmosphere. Studying full-time for exams right after graduation has become a popular phenomenon among the new generation of young people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is this phenomenon really blameless, even inspiring? Hard to say. The premise of the &quot;professional examination family&quot; is: they don&#39;t make money, they rely on support. College students are generally over 20 years old after graduation and cannot support themselves but rely on their parents. This kind of &quot;parasitism and support&quot; is all voluntary, and some parents even ask their children to take exams, but from a sociological perspective, they are not adults. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Young people get better education, get rid of the shadow of their parents, start careers, and surpass their parents&#39; achievements. This is a common phenomenon in a healthy society. Relying on parents for support and being unable to &quot;wean off the baby&quot;, the opportunity to obtain large amounts of wealth is directed to inheritance, and the life style of nibbling on the elderly and parasitism is ridiculed as &quot;full-time children&quot;. This kind of spiritual epidemic is a kind of malaise and decadence, and it is not worth beautifying at all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the surface, full-time candidates are pursuing a stable job, but in reality they are escaping from market competition. They have gone from being temporarily supported by their parents to hoping to be supported by the system. Even if they are admitted, their income comes from taxes, and taxes rely on individuals and companies to create value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is also the reason why the country requires streamlining administration, delegating power and reducing personnel. It’s just that due to the huge pressure on the job market, civil servants and public servants are regarded as “employment reservoirs” by some places. In recent years, local governments have been cutting jobs while expanding recruitment. This approach cannot completely solve the employment problem, but will only continue to delay it for you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The young people who are &quot;trapped in the postgraduate entrance exams&quot; are not really trapped. They just hope to pass the exam and get rid of market competition and sit back and relax. I personally don’t like this kind of life choice; and when the public examination becomes a popular competition, more and more people are addicted to it. I believe it is not a good thing for individuals and society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people feel that it is a helpless choice for young people to take the postgraduate and editing exams repeatedly. This is true to a certain extent, but this choice is not worthy of encouragement, and it must be pointed out that for personal destiny, this tragic and painful journey is full of huge risks. Is it worth it to spend so much effort &quot;getting involved&quot; with your peers in order to escape market competition? Wouldn’t it be much more meaningful if this kind of motivation and effort were applied to work? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, on the other hand, the other path, which seems to be full of thorns, is actually more reliable. In the past two years, many young people have taken jobs that were previously held by people with low academic qualifications. They face it with a pragmatic spirit, put aside their highly educated self-esteem, support themselves first, and then develop. Compared with those who are addicted to exams, this choice is more worthy of respect and more likely to lead to a better life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is the author&#39;s personal opinion only and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 12:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[山西大同小学生遭多名同学辱骂、殴打、欺凌，官方通报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257671]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 12:38:39&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On September 26, the joint working group of Datong City, Shanxi Province issued a notice. Recently, an incident occurred at Dacheng Bilingual School in Datong City. Incidents of bullying among minors have aroused public concern. Datong City quickly formed a joint working group involving the education, public security, procuratorial, judicial administration and other departments to carry out investigations and related work. The relevant situation is now reported as follows. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After investigation, primary school students Zhao Moumou (male, 9 years old) and Jin Moumou (male, 9 years old) of Datong City Dacheng Bilingual School assaulted their dormitory classmate Sun Moumou (male, 10 years old) many times Carrying out serious bad behaviors such as insults, beatings, and bullying. Because Zhao and Jin are both minors, the public security organs reprimanded Zhao and Jin in accordance with the &quot;Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China on the Prevention of Delinquency of Minors&quot; and ordered them to receive psychological counseling and behavioral modification; basis The &quot;Family Education Promotion Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; reprimands the guardians of Zhao and Jin and orders them to receive family education guidance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After investigation, Dacheng Bilingual School has seriously neglected its duties and responsibilities in management, resulting in negative social impact. The education administration department has implemented the &quot;Private Education Promotion Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; and the &quot;Regulations on the Implementation of the Private Education Promotion Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot;. and other laws and regulations, ordered Dacheng Bilingual School to rectify immediately and make rectifications within a time limit; dismissed Xu from his position as principal, dismissed the vice principal and primary school director Pei Moumou, the vice principal in charge of safety work Bai Moumou, the head teacher of the class involved Xin Moumou and Life teacher Hou Mou. At the same time, the education administration department made a decision to reduce the enrollment of Dacheng Bilingual School in the new school year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The joint working group ordered Zhao Moumou, Jin Moumou and their guardians to sincerely apologize to Sun Moumou and their guardians, and at the same time organized forces to carry out care, comfort, psychological counseling and other work for students and parents. During the school rectification period, the education administration department will be stationed in the school to supervise the entire process. Datong&#39;s education system and relevant units will learn lessons from this incident, carry out special rectification actions across the city, continue to strengthen school management, create a good environment for the healthy growth of minors, and punish relevant units and personnel found to have neglected their duties. Responsibilities will be strictly held accountable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 12:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[云南一幼师多次脚踹幼儿并扇脸，官方回应：涉事人被行拘]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257663]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;About Wangzhuan Zhaotong Report on a kindergarten teacher who repeatedly kicked and slapped a child in the face&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>; After investigation, it was found that on September 21, 2023, Zhang Moumou, a private kindergarten teacher in Tangfang Town, Zhenxiong County, Zhaotong City, beat a child.

Musk actually proposed to immigrate to Mars?&quot; Xiao Ai was reading an article introducing Musk The article on the Mars Immigration Plan said with emotion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Yes, Musk is indeed an entrepreneur with great imagination and creativity. It is hard to say whether Musk&#39;s plan will succeed, but it is really possible for humans to immigrate to Mars.&quot; Dad continued Over topic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Impossible? Do I know that Mars is dry, cold, and airless? It is a desert where living things cannot survive. Crops cannot be grown on Mars. What will the people on Earth eat when they immigrate there? Is it like the movie &quot; Does the protagonist Mark in &quot;The Martian&quot; grow potatoes like that?&quot; Xiao Ai usually reads popular science books and movies about Mars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Growing potatoes on Mars is still a bit far away, but it is not difficult to build a &#39;happy farm&#39; in space. It is also very possible to build a space farm on the moon or Mars in the future.&quot; Dad replied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Really? I suddenly became interested in how to build this space farm. Dad, tell me about it!&quot; Xiao Ai said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Okay.&quot; Dad Ai said with a little thought. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Happy Farm&quot; has many benefits&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Imagine if you are lucky enough to become an astronaut and have to live alone on the International Space Station for a year Half a year. At first, you look down at the blue earth for a while, and look up at the dazzling starry sky for a while. It feels very beautiful. But as time goes by, will you feel even more lonely in the small space station? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you can grow vegetables and flowers in the space station, and watch the seeds slowly grow green buds every day, grow up little by little, blossom and bear fruit, during this period, you can also give Fertilize, water, prune, and pollinate these plants. Record their growth process every day. At the same time, do some experimental records, occasionally take some beautiful photos or videos, and then share them with colleagues, family, and the public on earth. Will it add a lot of fun to your space life? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the nutritionists at the space center do their best to prepare delicious and nutritious food for you, the spacecraft&#39;s load is limited after all, so they have to compress and re-compress the food as much as possible to make packaged food. When you eat these packaged foods every day, you will definitely feel monotonous and boring, and the nutrients of these packaged foods, especially vitamin C, vitamin K, etc., will gradually be lost. If from time to time you could eat salads made from fresh vegetables and fruits grown by yourself, wouldn’t that be considered a delicacy in the world? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Imagine further that at some time in the future, more and more humans will work, travel or even settle on the moon, Mars and other planets. Will they need a lot of food, which must be transported entirely from the earth? Food costs are going to be very high. If some reusable space farms can be built on the moon, Mars or other planets to grow fresh vegetables, fruits, flowers and even food, providing enough fresh food for human space travelers, it may be an important basis for future interstellar immigration. one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/cMRt6xzzXGZRNcrSLdt1yiGqvwhtRvha8BQNsRuR.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1066&quot; height= &quot;1066&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/cMRt6xzzXGZRNcrSLdt1yiGqvwhtRvha8BQNsRuR.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252163&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zinnias planted by astronauts on the International Space Station. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(NASA/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Growing vegetables in space has become commonplace&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Human beings The unknown world is full of curiosity, and human exploration of the vast universe has never stopped. Since taking the first step into outer space, humans have begun to explore the impact of the space environment on various animals, plants and even microorganisms. Whether plants can grow in the space environment and whether they can provide fresh food for space travelers. Especially after the completion of the space station, astronauts have enough space and time to help scientists on earth answer these questions, and also add some fun and nutrition to the astronauts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1982, astronauts on the Soviet Salyut 7 space station used a miniature greenhouse device to conduct the first &quot;from seed to seed&quot; full life cycle cultivation experiment of Arabidopsis thaliana, proving that plants on earth can be Growth and seeding outside the earth have opened up human attempts to grow vegetables, flowers, and grains in space. In the following ten years, Soviet astronauts completed space cultivation experiments of various plants. However, these plants grown in space were not for human consumption, but were limited to scientific research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is American astronauts who actually grow vegetables to eat in space. In order to allow astronauts to eat fresh vegetables, fruits or other fresh foods, NASA has developed some plant cultivation devices, such as the vegetable production system Veggie and the advanced plant habitat APH. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The vegetable production system is a small plant growth device suitable for space stations that can automatically provide light, water, air and nutrients for vegetable growth. It is only the size of a suitcase and can generally grow 6 types of vegetables. . Since 2014, American astronauts have used vegetable production systems on the International Space Station to cultivate lettuce, Chinese cabbage, Chinese cabbage, kale, mustard, zinnias and other plants. Some of them are for scientific research, and some are used by astronauts. Eat it as a salad, I heard it tastes great. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The advanced plant habitat is a more complex, more automated, fully enclosed plant growth device equipped with cameras and more than 180 sensors that can monitor light, temperature, humidity, atmospheric content, etc. Sensing and controlling, and staying connected to the ground laboratory so that observations and research can be carried out simultaneously on the ground and the space station. Advanced plant habitat installations enable more complex, diverse, and long-term plant growth studies. So far, American astronauts have used this device to conduct full life cycle cultivation experiments of Arabidopsis thaliana, dwarf wheat, radish, pepper and other plants. The pepper planting test is the longest and most &quot;stimulating&quot; test among them. After more than three months of growth, the pepper seeds have gone through the entire process of germination, flowering, fruiting, and maturity. In November 2021, after the peppers matured, the astronauts stored part of them and left them for ground laboratories to conduct follow-up analysis and research, while the other parts were made into delicacies by them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/ZOmrdJMaHYfre5mMIu8NlOZMBXsOfVQDFKQj0KOM.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1032&quot; height= &quot;688&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/ZOmrdJMaHYfre5mMIu8NlOZMBXsOfVQDFKQj0KOM.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252165&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Astronauts pose with the peppers they grow on the International Space Station. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(NASA/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Rice bears seeds on the Chinese space station&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Shenzhou The first manned flight on the 5th, Yutu&#39;s visit to the moon, Zhurong&#39;s inspection of Mars, the &quot;reunion in space&quot; of the Chinese space station... The booming Chinese aerospace industry has also injected new vitality into the exploration of space farms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2019, a mysterious scientific device was transported to the far side of the moon by the Chinese lunar probe Chang&#39;e-4, where it was performing an important mission. This scientific device was developed by scientists from Chongqing University and contains four kinds of seeds, including cotton, rape, potato, and Arabidopsis, as well as two animal eggs, yeast and fruit fly. After landing on the far side of the moon, the seeds that were originally dormant began to wake up and enter growth and development mode. Within nine days, the seeds began to germinate, and the cotton seeds also sprouted buds. Although the germination of cotton seeds on the moon is just a flash in the pan, this is the first green leaf to grow on the moon. Perhaps in the near future, more plants will sprout, bloom and bear fruit on the moon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the newly built Chinese space station, Chinese astronauts started longer-term plant growth experiments. This time the test subjects were Arabidopsis thaliana and rice. As we all know, rice originated in China and is one of China&#39;s main food crops. No one has ever conducted a full life cycle cultivation experiment of rice in space before. During the four-month test, both Arabidopsis and rice successfully completed the entire life cycle of seed germination, seedling growth, flowering and seeding, proving that rice can grow on the space station. However, scientists have observed that many indicators of rice grown on the space station are significantly different from rice grown on the ground, such as earlier flowering period, longer grain filling time, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rice generally has the ability to regenerate. The rice stalks left behind after normal harvest can also grow rice ears, thus increasing rice yield. This experiment also observed the regeneration ability of rice on the space station. As a result, more than 20 days after the rice was harvested, a rice plant on the space station also regenerated and grew two rice ears, indicating that regenerating rice is feasible in a small closed environment. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our country has achieved world-leading scientific and technological achievements in the field of aerospace breeding. It is believed that with the in-depth development of aerospace projects such as the China Space Station, the Moon Landing Project and the Planetary Exploration Project, our country’s astronauts will be in a wider field. Grow vegetables, flowers, and crops in space to bring fresh, nutritious and delicious food to future space travelers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Km6QSDoE6uvnXPxyRos0LJ1iz8pZkqoCacoyIswX.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;806&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Km6QSDoE6uvnXPxyRos0LJ1iz8pZkqoCacoyIswX.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252164&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Rice seeds growing in the Chinese space station. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;How far is it from the real space farm&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;However, so far So far, these plant cultivation experiments conducted in the space station have been extremely small-scale. It is a huge challenge to actually build a space farm, and there are still many problems that need to be solved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether it is the moon or Mars, the harsh environment is not suitable for plant growth at all. Therefore, the first step in building a space farm is to build a large-scale intelligently controlled greenhouse facility, similar to the intelligent greenhouses built on the earth, so that Plants have &quot;houses&quot; to live in. First of all, this greenhouse facility is completely airtight, can maintain stable temperature, and can protect plants and humans from cosmic rays. Secondly, this greenhouse facility is suitable for remote control, which requires full monitoring of the growth process of plants and timely control of temperature and light. , atmosphere, moisture and nutrients are precisely controlled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second step is to allow the plants to &quot;eat and drink&quot; to maintain the operation of plant life and the operation of the entire greenhouse facility. The main power for greenhouse operation comes from solar power generation. This technology is not difficult, but it is a big problem to provide the necessary soil, nutrients, water, atmosphere, etc. for plant growth. Soil mainly provides support and nutrients for the growth of plant roots. Studies have shown that plants can grow in lunar soil or volcanic ash, but they will grow more slowly than in earth soil. In addition to soil, hydroponics can also be used. This smart greenhouse is relatively common on the earth. Of course, hydroponics requires a lot of water. The moon and Mars are both dry planets with little water and require artificial synthesis. This means that water must be accurately distributed to plants according to their needs. Plants also need carbon dioxide for photosynthesis, and nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are needed for plant growth. These need to be synthesized or extracted by making full use of raw materials on the planet where they are located. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the &quot;housing&quot; and &quot;food and drink&quot; problems are solved, the protagonist can be invited out. At this time, it is very important to choose what kind of plants to plant. Not all plants are suitable for space farms. First, these candidate plants must be able to adapt to the unfavorable conditions of space, such as microgravity, high radiation, large temperature differences, lack of water and fertilizer; secondly, candidate plants should be rich in vitamins, antioxidants and other nutrients to provide space for astronauts, space tourists or settlers. Supplement additional nutrients; in addition, candidate plants should have the characteristics of short growth cycle, small space occupation, and easy management. In addition to selecting existing plant varieties, in the future, scientists may tailor special plant varieties for space farms, such as potatoes that are more suitable for growing in Martian ash, tomatoes that grow better under microgravity conditions, etc. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, each plant to be grown on the space farm needs to be carefully selected and passed simulation tests in ground laboratories to accurately calculate the nutrients, moisture, atmosphere, light, etc. required for its growth. , in order to minimize the waste of resources in space. It is worth mentioning that NASA assigned this part of the work to middle school students. NASA has launched a &quot;Growing Beyond Earth&quot; public welfare program, inviting middle school students across the United States to participate in space plant growth research and select plants suitable for planting on the International Space Station. As of December 2022, more than 40,000 middle school students and their instructors have participated in this activity, and screening tests of more than 180 types of plants have been carried out, and pak choi grown on the vegetable production system is one of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China’s manned moon landing plan is being steadily implemented, and the U.S. government also plans to return to the moon. Musk even proposed to build a self-sufficient city on Mars around 2050, and it is possible for humans to settle outside the earth.

In 2002, he retired from Sanlian Bookstore and established his own studio. Retirement just means changing places and continuing to design books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When drawing design drawings, Ning Chengchun&#39;s sitting posture was the same as when he was young: his back was straight, his shoulder blades were arched, and his head was slightly bent. He is still used to wearing shirts. The biggest change in his appearance is that he has grown a silvery white beard and trimmed it neatly after getting older. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are various books, a computer, and a pot of tea on his work table. Through the window on the left, sunlight pours in. The computer was for the assistant. Ning Chengchun used pens, rulers, and grid paper. The covers and layouts that were drawn by hand were handed to the assistant and turned into computer files. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are two book walls in the studio, and one of the bookshelves contains books he designed himself. In August 2023, he published the collection &quot;A Person&#39;s History of Book Design&quot;. In his nearly one year of design career, he has produced more than 1,500 books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These sixty years are equivalent to a history of contemporary Chinese publishing. In 1986, after Sanlian Bookstore resumed its independent establishment, Ning Chengchun became the first director of the art department. His works outline the historical changes of Sanlian Bookstore. The &quot;Reading and Writing Series&quot; closely related to the publisher Fan Yong established the ideological banner of the 1980s; &quot;Huai Ju Shi Cun&quot; and &quot;Bathing&quot; designed for Qian Zhongshu and Yang Jiang set a precedent for writing books for a large number of scholars. ; &quot;Collection of Jin Yong&#39;s Works&quot; has made countless fans of Jin Yong bow and remain unforgettable to this day; &quot;Chen Yinke&#39;s Last 20 Years&quot; inspired the &quot;Chen Yinke craze&quot; in the 1990s; the &quot;Local China&quot; series has led the creation of &quot;picture books&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of the editor of Sanlian Bookstore, Ning Chengchun is not old at all. When he has an important manuscript, he still asks him to contribute as he has done for decades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the balcony, a Monstera deliciosa grows as tall as a person. It was given to Ning Chengchun by his colleagues when he was hospitalized in 2008. Assistant Hu Changyue met Ning Chengchun in 2006. At that time, Ning Chengchun was working hard. At most, he hired 6 assistants to cooperate with the design. During his hospitalization, Ning Chengchun was still drawing layouts even in the hospital bed. The nurse reminded him to stop drawing and take a good rest. Within a week of his heart bypass surgery, he was back in the studio. &quot;If you can&#39;t do it in a day, you can do it for half a day.&quot; Hu Changyue recalled to a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the second year after the operation, Ning Chengchun decided to close his studio, but many people continued to approach him for design, but the number of orders was reduced, and the work did not really stop. In 2019, Ning Chengchun underwent another heart stent surgery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that the collection of works has been published and is selling well, he wants to &quot;retire&quot; as soon as possible, writing, painting, and reading books that he had no time to read before. But when someone asked him to design some books, he still couldn&#39;t bear to refuse. The National Library wanted to publish &quot;The Complete Collection of Dunhuang Documents&quot;, and he agreed, &quot;This is a very important book. You can&#39;t just watch it fail.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Changyue said that Ning Chengchun received the invitation, I was actually very happy in my heart, but my body really couldn’t bear it. The job of declining various design invitations was left to Hu Changyue. When faced with requests from others, Ning Chengchun would most likely nod, &quot;Okay,&quot; &quot;Okay, okay.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun likes natural, folk and humanistic things. The books in his studio are dotted with various traditional artifacts he collected: blue and white porcelain, Pixiu stone carvings, and paper-cuts. His collection is all based on hobbies and nothing expensive or rare. While out hunting, I saw the cute porcelain bowls in farmers’ homes, so I bought a few from the local second-hand market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He took out a set of picture albums that he bought from the Panjiayuan Secondhand Bookstore. They were all full of line-drawn bronzes. He had bought a 32-karat version before and the pictures were very small. This set has a large format and the decorations are clear at a glance. &quot;Actually, there were many good things in ancient times.&quot; Ning Chengchun murmured. In the past twenty years, he has experimented with various traditional patterns, either using them on the spine of books or using a continuous square pattern as the background of the cover. His designs have become increasingly quaint and solemn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Ning Chengchun’s eyes, utensils are used by ordinary people in their daily lives. They are made by unknown craftsmen and may look humble, but they have the beauty of everyday life. Books are utensils that serve people, and they should also have &quot;the beauty of utensils.&quot; Literary theorist Chao Wen once said, &quot;The art of binding is the soul of book aesthetics.&quot; Ning Chengchun deeply agrees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/w6CnLaxNeAhI3NTtNyendEzVb4nrAsxVucvuSfKU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1156&quot; height= &quot;1600&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/w6CnLaxNeAhI3NTtNyendEzVb4nrAsxVucvuSfKU.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252130&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1985, Ning Chengchun was at Kodansha Japan. In the 1980s, he went to Japan twice for further study, allowing Ning Chengchun to truly and systematically study design, and his design concepts were in line with the world. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;This is what this book should look like&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>;A variety of teas are placed on the dining table in the studio. Ning Chengchun always makes a cup of tea when guests visit. The book designer&#39;s studio is also a living room. Editors, printing staff, and suppliers often come to the door. Ning Chengchun has long been accustomed to switching between putting down and picking up design drafts at any time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At home, the time after getting up in the morning and before going to bed at night is the quietest time. Ning Chengchun likes to conceive designs at these moments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After visiting his studio, Zhang Lixian, the founder of Duku, said: &quot;The designers I have come into contact with are all very good-tempered. I think it is because they communicate too much with editors and are polished. I have a good temper.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of Ning Chengchun&#39;s early masterpieces, &quot;The Journey to the West&quot;, designed 12 drafts, three or four plans each time, and submitted it for review several times before it was approved. The highest record is a book on international trade, with 20 drafts designed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the plan was called back, what Ning Chengchun thought was, &quot;Maybe because I didn&#39;t understand the book or didn&#39;t meet his ideas, I will continue to do it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Mindset Only if you are better can you persist for sixty years.&quot; Ning Chengchun attributed this to his family influence. His brother was labeled as a rightist, and the family lost income. His mother taught him from an early age to work seriously, argue for words, and talk less. No matter at school or at work, Ning Chengchun was used to working hard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Ning Chengchun entered the industry in his early days, all he could think about was design. When he woke up every morning, his mind was already spinning even before he was fully awake. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There were many political movements at that time. When a book was published by a publishing house, all the art editors would design it, and then choose from many designs. In other words, it may be in vain. Ning Chengchun didn&#39;t care about this and just kept busy. He is the youngest but has been selected the most times. For many years, Ning Chengchun designed sixty or seventy books every year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1992, when he designed the book &quot;Yixing Zisha Appreciation&quot;, Ning Chengchun had no knowledge of Zisha teapots and tea. He and his photographer traveled to 24 places across the country to take photos of classic Zisha teapots. Due to the limitations of technology at that time, many of the negatives produced were color cast, but Ning Chengchun had seen and touched all the teapots, and listened to the explanations of Gu Jingzhou, an expert on purple clay teapots, so he repeatedly adjusted the color tone of the layout with the plate maker based on his feeling and memory. When printing at the printing factory, Ning Chengchun woke up once every hour and 15 minutes to supervise the color effects, and stared at it for four days and nights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Post-80s designers Xu Yijun and Ning Chengchun went to the printing factory together. During the book printing process, color shades or technical details may not be completely accurate, and some differences are difficult to discern with the naked eye. Designers need to be on-site to help solve the problem. Printing was done all night long, and Ning Chengchun sometimes had to get up in the middle of the night to go to the workshop to look at the samples. Now that he was old, Xu Yijun and other young designers persuaded him to take a rest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Hu Changyue&#39;s eyes, Ning Chengchun&#39;s rigor in publications was beyond imagination. Once when a picture book was being produced, the quality of a picture was not good enough. The editor said that there was only this picture and there was no way to replace it. Ning Chengchun said sternly that if a higher quality picture could not be found, this picture must be used for publication. , he stopped doing it. Finally, he and the editor rummaged through the box and found the negative of the picture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jiaming, former deputy editor-in-chief of Sanlian, compared book design to building a house, “After a book editor has worked hard to compile a good book, he will always consciously or unconsciously imagine what the designer will design it to look like. ”, and the designer arranges the graphics and text content appropriately to create a reading space that looks attractive from the outside, allowing readers to walk in without any obstacles and is pleasing to the eye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;A manuscript is just a stack of paper. To form a book, it must be designed. The quality of the design has a great influence on the book.&quot; Ning Chengchun said that after the book is finished, others will read it and feel that it is a good book. It should look like this, and he would be happy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/c0sy4P7398JfwDUR9toiBjcD4ECRxLJT3qVHMq4X.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1600&quot; height= &quot;1302&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/c0sy4P7398JfwDUR9toiBjcD4ECRxLJT3qVHMq4X.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252131&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;When he entered the industry in his early days, Ning Chengchun designed sixty or seventy books a year. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Design is not just a cover&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>; Ning Chengchun loved books. When he was in middle school, Yang Shuo&#39;s generation of writers came into public view. He read many Chinese literary works. At that time, Tianjin People&#39;s Publishing House and Baihua Literature and Art Publishing House were publishing with high quality, which he still remembers today. Many small books published by Baihua Literature and Art are &quot;very lively and have illustrations. The illustrations of Zhang Deyu and Wang Guofeng are very famous.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun’s eldest brother taught art in school. Under his influence, Ning Chengchun liked painting since he was a child. Mass cultural and artistic activities are also active in Tianjin. Ning Chengchun took the painting class of the district cultural center and went to the old house with several floors to paint in his spare time every week. When he was in junior high school, he published some sketches in newspapers and periodicals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;His first choice in the college entrance examination was the printmaking department. Printmaking played a propaganda role in various movements during the Anti-Japanese War and the early days of the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China. It was &quot;down-to-earth and not too lofty.&quot; At that time, many book illustrations were created by printmakers, and he also hoped to work in a publishing house. In the end, he was admitted to his second choice and entered the Decoration Department of the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts. Three years later, he was transferred to the book art major. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1960s, there was no systematic modern design teaching in China, and most of what Ning Chengchun came into contact with was painting education. For those who study painting, they prefer design literature books, political economic philosophy books, and can only do abstract designs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He clearly remembers the first academic book he designed, &quot;Wittgenstein&quot;. The philosophy book was difficult to understand, and I couldn’t use too concrete paintings to express it. I designed many drafts, but they didn’t pass. Ning Chengchun went to the publishing house&#39;s library to look through the collection of paintings, searching for modern paintings from Wittgenstein&#39;s period, trying to figure out the relationship between Mondrian and others&#39; paintings and philosophy, and finally applied large color blocks to the cover design. Later, when designing a series of triplex academic books, Ning Chengchun would start with abstract patterns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Yijun asked Ning Chengchun why his contemporaries who studied design changed careers one after another, but he persisted. Ning Chengchun thought for a moment and replied, maybe because he went to Japan to study. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun truly and systematically studied design when he went to Japan for further study twice in 1984 and 1986. In Japan, Ning Chengchun personally studied design masters Sugiura Shohei and Manabe Kazuo, and took up basic design courses to integrate with the world in design concepts. At that time, all domestic design relied on painting, and no one knew how to use grids. Ning Chengchun returned from his studies and helped Sanlian usher in the era of picture books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From Ning Chengchun’s graduation to 1995, nearly thirty years of the printing era, all design was done by hand. With the advent of computers, printing was gradually eliminated, and he was still used to designing on paper first. Ning Chengchun did not know how to operate a computer. At that time, the computer company next to the publishing house had five computers. He sat in the middle, drew the layout, and directed five assistants to use the computers to complete the work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Designers of Lu Mingjing’s generation basically complete the entire design process on the computer, while Ning Chengchun still maintains the habit of manual grid design. It was pictures and books that prompted Lu Mingjing to learn from Ning Chengchun. The first task she received was to design Jiang Xun&#39;s &quot;History of Chinese Art for Everyone&quot;. The pictures were many and the text was fragmented, and the layout was difficult to form a block, which was very unsightly. Facing such a book, Lu Mingjing, who had just entered the industry, was confused. Wang Jiaming suggested that she go to Ning Chengchun&#39;s studio to study. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun took out several pieces of octavo paper, a ruler, and a pen, and showed Lu Mingjing how to use a grid to draw a layout, and accurately calculate the number of words on each page and the size of the pictures. &quot;The pictures and text information are all controlled on the manuscript paper, instead of pushing it page by page, and falling into the dilemma of having to redo the entire book if a few pictures are changed.&quot; Lu Mingjing realized that the seemingly backward grid design , actually has its own advantages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While studying at Sugiura Kohei&#39;s studio, Ning Chengchun understood the meaning of what he said: &quot;A book is a universe.&quot; Later, Ning Chengchun introduced Sugiura Kohei&#39;s theory for the first time in China. Sugiura Kohei emphasized the overall design and the core position of the book binding designer in the book design process, &quot;from the layout of the text, text, font, font size, title, table of contents, title page, cover, letter sleeve, belt to the copyright page, and the design of All paper and material selections, and printing and binding process settings are within the scope of the book designer&#39;s responsibilities. Modern book design concepts were promoted in China, and everyone began to understand that design is not just about making a cover. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Yijun observed that in the early days of Ning Chengchun’s design career, design was often regarded as a vassal and branch of painting and lacked independence. As one of the first batch of book designers to study in Japan, Ning Chengchun mastered the professionalism of design. Coupled with his &quot;persistent pursuit of the design profession, including personal talents and opportunities&quot;, multiple factors superimposed to support his departure. Come down. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“I did what I should do for this book”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When Ning Chengchun came back from Japan, he was over forty and his hair began to turn gray. When he made &quot;Chen Yinke&#39;s Last 20 Years&quot; in 1995, his hair turned gray overnight. The 200,000-word manuscript that fascinated him was once stolen along with his backpack. Ning Chengchun couldn&#39;t describe the pain. In just a few days, regret and guilt turned his hair white. Fortunately, two weeks later, the thief who took away the wages left the manuscript at the door of the neighborhood committee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun chose a black cover for this book because both the content itself and the author&#39;s writing made him feel the intensity of emotion and the depression of the atmosphere. He compressed the catalog together, arranged it into an upside-down, fragmented, and disorderly combination, and placed it on the top of the cover to express the condensation of the last 20 years of the author&#39;s life. The photo of Chen Yinke on the lower right was one that Ning Chengchun spotted at a glance from many photos - his eyes were blind, but still bright, and he was holding the crutch tightly with both hands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It particularly represents Mr. Chen&#39;s spiritual atmosphere in his later years, lonely and determined, as if staring at us descendants in the heavy shadow of history.&quot; He believes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Hua, the person in charge of Shenzhen Shangshu Bar, has collected more books designed by Ning Chengchun than Ning Chengchun himself. He began to pay attention to book binding design in the 1990s and found that each book presented a different state. Sanlian&#39;s books were quite different from other publishing houses, being more elegant and heavy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Zhang Hua’s view, Ning Chengchun’s designs reveal a unique Chinese spirit. &quot;His creative language has absorbed the essence of traditional binding very well. He has taken deep roots. He also caught up with the reform and opening up. He went to Japan to study twice and learned modern techniques. He is not conservative at all, which is even more rare.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun often thinks about how to distinguish each book when designing. Every book is unique. To design well, a designer must first understand the author&#39;s thoughts and feelings, and then convey this understanding to readers through book binding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you encounter a book that attracts you, the design is often more inspiring. Ning Chengchun was very moved after reading &quot;Fu Shan&#39;s World&quot;. The author Bai Qianshen is an art history scholar. He originally studied international politics, but turned to calligraphy after studying in the United States. He tells the story of Fu Shan&#39;s ideological changes by examining the society in the late Ming Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When designing, Ning Chengchun used Fu Shan’s calligraphy works as the background. In a chaotic night sky, those characters slightly emitted seven-color light, as if flying from the depths of history, ancient and modern. The book has a wide influence and is constantly reprinted. Bai Qianshen highly approves of it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I did what I should do for this book.” When Ning Chengchun talks about these books that he has never forgotten, his words can go very far. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The understanding between designers and authors sometimes extends from books to reality. After retiring from Sanlian in 2002, Ning Chengchun received direct invitations from many authors. Wang Yuanhua and Zhong Shuhe both wrote letters asking him to design. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cultural relic expert Wang Shixiang asked a publishing house to design &quot;Jin Hui Hei&quot;. When printing, he found that the design format was wrong and could not be printed. He found Ning Chengchun for help. &quot;At that time, he had just lost the sight in his left eye, and he was so anxious that he was really trusting him with his life.&quot; The two became friends from then on. Wang Shixiang sometimes went to the Sanlian Art Studio to look at design drafts and invited Ning Chengchun to have dinner downstairs. Ning Chengchun once witnessed Wang Shixiang instructing the chef to improve the taste of eel paste. The next time he went back, the store made it according to his method. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This is no longer just reading a manuscript, the key points of the manuscript and the author&#39;s taste are all very clear.&quot; Wang Jiaming sighed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Hong Kong triptych edition of Wang Shixiang&#39;s &quot;Research on Ming Style Furniture&quot; is divided into volumes with pictures and texts. Ning Chengchun found it inconvenient to read, so when designing this book, he reintegrated the text narrative, picture explanation, and illustrations. Wang Shixiang&#39;s wife, Yuan Quanyou, did a lot of work for this book. Unfortunately, she passed away before the design of the book was completed. Ning Chengchun knew that Wang and Yuan had been together all their lives and had a deep love for each other, so he temporarily added and changed the design. He chose a black background for the cover, with a line drawing drawn by Yuan Quanyou printed in white gold stamping in the middle. There are two Ming-style chairs designed on the cover of the letter sleeve. One is a photo of the actual object, and the other is a line drawing of Yuan Quanyou, as if the two people met each other in heaven and earth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Hua was moved by a series of Wang Shixiang&#39;s works designed by Ning Chengchun: &quot;The younger generation does not know much about Wang Shixiang&#39;s pursuit and achievements. It can be presented perfectly, and the content and form are completely unified. That is very difficult and can only be designed after full understanding.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some books failed to be implemented according to his ideas, which will also become a regret that Ning Chengchun talks about. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When designing &quot;The Complete Works of Lu Xun&#39;s Manuscripts&quot;, he hoped to put the statue in front of the Lu Xun Memorial Hall - a more natural and life-like appearance - on the cover using 3D imaging technology. The effect was very good, but in the end the publisher chose a safer solution and used the black-and-white photos of Lu Xun in the textbook. Ning Chengchun felt that the design could have been more innovative. Now is no longer the era of &quot;cold eyebrows&quot;. &quot;Lu Xun&#39;s life was difficult and he had a fragile side.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There is nothing we can do about it. You are Party B, and I am Party A.&quot; Ning Chengchun smiled and changed the topic again, &quot;But I will use this method again when I meet the right person in the future. I will definitely It must be suitable, and ordinary people are not suitable.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;It is difficult to overcome loneliness&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun showed Lu Mingjing a sketchbook. He took it with him when he went to participate in the Four Clean-Up Movements in college, and he painted the countryside scenery along the way. It takes two to three hundred miles to walk from the city of Beijing through the suburbs to the countryside of Hebei. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun told her that she could leave now. Lu Mingjing asked, how to go? Ning Chengchun said, arrange a car, let&#39;s go and put our luggage in the car. Are you coming with me? Lu Mingjing agreed wholeheartedly, thinking to herself, oh, I have to do it all over again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;He will encourage you for anything that is beyond what ordinary people can do.&quot; Lu Mingjing discovered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than ten years ago, they met a violin maker together. The workshop is in a small thatched house on a remote hill. The guqin he and his disciples made was expensive enough to allow them to be independent from the world and not have to worry about making a living. Ning Chengchun encouraged Lu Mingjing: &quot;You have to become such a person!&quot; Lu Mingjing had just started working at that time and was a little confused. She understood what he meant - now that she has special skills, she no longer needs to be confused about whether to be born in the world or to join the world. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many of Ning Chengchun’s contemporary designers have become painters and artists. Xu Yijun asked Ning Chengchun, who was also good at painting, if he wanted to become an artist. Ning Chengchun answered firmly: no , I just want to be a designer all the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Xu Yijun was studying design, his classmates generally believed that design would not be a lifelong career. &quot;They all voted with their feet and they all left.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Design has long been regarded as a practical art, and has not been taken seriously in the traditional thinking of attaching more importance to morality than tools. There is a huge difference in social status between artists and designers. Xu Yijun mentioned the fault lines in China’s design industry. There are only a handful of people born in the 1940s like Ning Chengchun who are still writing books. &quot;Although there are very few designers of the older generation, there are still some. This is too precious, otherwise I would be very lonely.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Paper books are already a sunset industry. If you study graphic design, you can switch to Internet product design. Higher income. Xu Yijun said that paper books are not very profitable, and many design companies produce them in batches. &quot;If you spend so much time doing it, it may be difficult to survive.&quot; It is rare for designers of Ning Chengchun&#39;s generation to spend a lot of effort on each book. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Mingjing once divided book designers into different types and styles such as philosophers, engineers, and artists. Ning Chengchun chose the opposite path to artists who express themselves. He has an exciting side, but he is willing to shrink himself and hide his name behind a book. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun emphasized one thing in his book and interviews. At the 8th National Book Design Art Exhibition, a Japanese design theorist looked at the exhibits and said that an author spent a lot of time writing a book. If the designer included personal things in the book, it would be a great disservice to the author of the text. Disrespectful. &quot;This phenomenon is very common among the exhibits in the Eighth Exhibition, which is to break away from the text, or impose the text to create something, in order to attract attention, for personal display of skills, not for the book, not for the text, this pure artistic tendency, he They say this is disrespectful to the book and the author, but no one takes it seriously,&quot; Ning Chengchun told a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun always speaks out directly about things that are not in line with his own ideas. In one event, Ning Chengchun was a judge and felt that the procedures were very unreasonable. Even after he pointed it out, there was no change, and he finally left the venue angrily. &quot;Young people&#39;s awards... are too focused on fame and fortune.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun is very wary of the impetuous and utilitarian atmosphere. &quot;Put utilitarianism first, and everything is for utilitarianism, and that won&#39;t work.&quot; In Japan, he has seen many college students doing carpentry, which is also very good. Society should not be so monotonous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Southern Weekend reporters visited, Ning Chengchun was working on Lei Diansheng’s book. Ning Chengchun admired this hiker who was the first person to cross Lop Nur and traveled all over China in ten years. When he walked in the late 1990s, the economy was booming and all walks of life were making money. However, Lei Diansheng had been preparing for ten years. He had planned all the details in advance and was well-planned and capable. &quot;He relied entirely on one person to overcome many difficulties. It is difficult to overcome loneliness first.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun always reminds Xu Yijun of Lu Xun’s words: Huge buildings are always made of wood and stone. Why don’t we make this wood and stone? I do little bits and pieces from time to time, just for this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Everyone wants to do earth-shattering things and have heroic ideas. There is no point in doing these ordinary things. But now I don’t think so.&quot; Xu Yijun said that many great ancient buildings , such as the Forbidden City, was designed by unknown craftsmen, &quot;It is also important to make ordinary books, and do things in a down-to-earth manner.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Yijun worked with Ning Chengchun for a long time last year. He found that no matter which city he went to, Ning Chengchun always had books to design with him. “Keep reading, keep reading, and eat.” Lie on the bed after dinner, then take out the manuscript and read it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun always said that he only does one thing in his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Xu Yijun and Zhang Huahua changed their names at the request of the interviewees)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 09:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[傅首尔与老刘闹离婚说明了什么？“全职丈夫”难以得到尊重]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257545]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The divorce between Fu Seoul and Lao Liu on the show made the variety show earn enough traffic, but it still It is a soap opera in life. Although it cannot be said to be a bad drama, it is also a plot that many people like me don&#39;t like to watch at all. Even so, we can still learn enough &quot;lessons&quot; from this incident. One of them is that men should be &quot;full-time husbands/full-time dads&quot; because society&#39;s acceptance of this is too low and it is difficult to be respected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fu Seoul and Lao Liu have experienced &quot;poor and lowly couples suffer all kinds of sorrows&quot; and can be regarded as a couple in need. After Fu Seoul rose to prominence through &quot;Qi Pa Shuo&quot;, Lao Liu began his career as a complete &quot;full-time husband&quot; and the source of Fu Seoul&#39;s jokes. In terms of the height an individual can achieve, Fu Seoul is definitely a strong woman and a successful person who uses knowledge and eloquence to embark on a unique track. There is no doubt about this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Lao Liu returned to the family and became a full-time husband, the good stories about their marriage have existed on the Internet for a long time. Every time he participates in the show, Fu Seoul will almost always talk about how good Lao Liu is to him. Fu Seoul and Lao Liu had divorced once before. Later, they remarried. The reason was that Fu Seoul, who was on the rise in his career, had a mess in his work and life after the divorce. Fu Seoul also publicly described this marriage as &quot;the best marriage I could ever encounter.&quot; If this is the case, then why should we go to that step again at this time? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because, the status and relationship between the two people are no longer what they used to be. The ancient saying that &quot;time and status change people&quot; must also exist in marriage relationships. The &quot;economic ability determines family status&quot; that today&#39;s people lament is actually the truth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Lao Liu has advanced in the life of a stay-at-home husband to the point where Fu Seoul kicks him and &quot;knows it&#39;s time to pour out the water&quot;, and Fu Seoul asks Lao Liu to throw away the garbage even though there is a trash can next to him. , they will never &quot;go back&quot;. Regarding the happiness of marriage, there are only feelings left. &quot;I can guarantee that my husband is very happy to be a stay-at-home dad, and I can make money to support the family.&quot; When Fu Seoul said this, Lao Liu was experiencing the most difficult time. This shows that Fu Seoer no longer understands his husband. And Lao Liu also lost himself in being misunderstood and became a symbol. Although he said that he didn&#39;t mind being used as a joke and ridiculed by Fu Seoul on the show, the subtext I realized was: The premise is that you have to respect me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, what did Fu Seoul say? She said: Do you know why a person keeps making salted fish? Because he is suitable to be a salty fish. Once the belief of not seeking improvement is formed, he will even breathe slower than others. You should not push him, because there is no harm if there are no expectations. Of course, there is an element of &quot;program need&quot; in such a statement, but too many details have already revealed that Fu Seoul is increasingly intolerant of Liu&#39;s &quot;not seeking to improve&quot;. She may not even realize that she has regarded Liu as a Stephen Chow It&#39;s a waste of words. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A blogger wrote: Lao Liu was forced to struggle by Fu Seoul. Which full-time housewife has experienced this? Lao Liu became the material for Fu Seoul&#39;s jokes. Which full-time housewife has experienced this? Lao Liu needs to report accounts to Fu Seoul. How many full-time housewives have experienced this? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is indeed not necessarily true. For example, some jokesters will also &quot;operate&quot; on their wives, but overall, Lao Liu&#39;s experience is indeed the real experience of &quot;full-time husbands&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Years ago, an old acquaintance quit his job and became a full-time &quot;housewife&quot; because he had to take care of his children. Although he talked about the pleasure of having a lot of free time when he was drinking with us, in his heart, he became increasingly intolerable to a life where he had to look at his wife&#39;s face even for pocket money and clothes. This is the same thing as the case where Lao Liu wanted to buy clothes he liked but because Fu Seoul didn&#39;t like them, his expectations were wiped out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All the shocking details do not appear out of thin air and have no direction. To put it bluntly, whether it is Lao Liu or some &quot;house men&quot;, they have lost the respect of their wives and been rejected, which has become a normal feature of life. It’s hard to imagine how long this kind of lack of understanding and respect can last. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people didn’t understand Lao Liu’s complaints, thinking it was pretentious and something he did in his spare time. But if the identity were to be changed - if the husband had all kinds of dislikes and restrictions on the stay-at-home wife, wouldn&#39;t many people be upset? In addition, if a stay-at-home housewife complains that she is under great pressure, she is often sympathized with, but you see, after Lao Liu’s difficulties were revealed, many people accused him of not knowing how to be blessed despite being blessed, and of not being considerate of Fu who worked hard outside. Seoul. What a double standard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The difference between a full-time wife and a full-time husband exists objectively. Simply put, stay-at-home wives are more tolerated, while stay-at-home husbands are not. This nature has transcended the scope of a family. The pressure faced by that old acquaintance was not limited to his wife, but also came from the strange looks from the people around him. Some netizens also mentioned various bitternesses when commenting on Fu Seoul and Lao Liu&#39;s divorce. For example, no matter how you explain the &quot;force majeure&quot; of being a stay-at-home husband, you may still be regarded as a &quot;soft ricer.&quot; I would like to ask, have women been looked down upon as &quot;soft rice eaters&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When traditional social concepts have shaped men into &quot;family breadwinners and family responsibility bearers&quot;, in the eyes of some people, it is unforgivable for men to return to the family. This proves that men actually lack the public opinion environment to become full-time husbands. If you do it accidentally, you have to change it. A male compatriot I know started working odd jobs after being unemployed for many days and relying on his wife to support the family. He didn&#39;t make much money and was still looked down upon by his wife, but at least he could &quot;straighten his back a little&quot; in front of his neighbors. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is said that marriage is based on love. Isn’t marriage based on respect? First, if a man really needs to be a full-time husband, the prerequisite must be that he can be respected by his family and society. Since being a full-time wife is a job for a woman, it is also a job for a man to be a full-time husband. He should not be labeled as &quot;eating soft food&quot; or &quot;receiving charity&quot;. Secondly, since the concept that men cannot eat soft rice is still solidified, then a man must think clearly whether his choice is appropriate, whether he can withstand the pressure caused by it in the future, and whether there is a better choice than being a full-time husband. Options? The reality is cruel. When the subtlety and even contradictions in the relationship between husband and wife gradually become apparent due to one&#39;s &quot;full-time&quot; choice, can one calmly bear the consequences of being unhappy or even being confused? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[去珠峰]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257428]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/20/gZ8MqmWkWhwE91TzmJdUkCKkearqzv7ohY6Hk2KN.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2434&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/gZ8MqmWkWhwE91TzmJdUkCKkearq zv7ohY6Hk2KN. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251363&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Dingri County, Shigatse, Tibet, overlooking Mount Everest from Rongbuk Temple&lt;span style=&quot; color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Dashi/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Going to Mount Everest requires a border defense permit.

One night, I was sitting and chatting with a geographer on the playground of Lanzhou University. He told a thrilling story about the scientific expedition on Mount Everest: a strong man with severe altitude sickness was lifted off a relay from an altitude of 6,300 meters. He got lost in the dark, snow fell on Mount Everest, and dangers arose one after another. He talked about the accident on the plateau, and I added: Wanma Tseden also died on the plateau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Geographers were surprised that director Wanma passed away in May.

The road is mostly smooth, with occasional bumps. This 5,476-kilometer-long ordinary road has a large altitude difference. Sometimes it spirals between hard mountains, and sometimes it rises in &quot;trough-shaped geologically broken sections&quot;. National Highway 318 was originally the Sichuan-Tibet Highway built from 1950 to 1954.

Under the north slope of Mount Everest, there is a north-south Rongbuk ditch, which was washed by the Rongbuk River.

In 1921, when the legendary mountaineer Mallory tried to scout out a climbing route to Mount Everest, he missed the intersection of the East Rongbuk Glacier. But one of their team members discovered the East Rongbuk route. Since then, all climbing teams climbing Mount Everest from the north slope have taken this route. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/LuDSe8HweSQog5rP9TkaRw4lfOmc8e1SKPgzAzdm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2519&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/LuDSe8HweSQog5rP9TkaRw4lfOmc8e1SKPgzAzdm.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251359&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The &quot;108 Turns&quot; leading to Mount Everest&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Dashi/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;In the mouths of Western mountaineers, the road along the East Rongbuk Glacier to the advance camp is called the &quot;miracle highway.&quot; The scientific expedition team members of the Northwest Institute of Ecological Environment and Resources of the Chinese Academy of Sciences were quite surprised by this name. They had walked it several times and always called it the &quot;Yak Trail.&quot; This road is easy for yaks and people to walk on. It only takes 5 hours at a fast pace and 10 hours at a slower pace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Mallory missed the East Rongbuk Glacier, he took a precious photo of the Middle Rongbuk Glacier. During the 2023 Mount Everest scientific expedition, the Northwest Research Institute found Mallory&#39;s photo spot after three efforts. By comparing two photos spanning a century, they estimated that the Zhongrongbuk Glacier has retreated 4 kilometers from the past, or an average of 40 meters per year. The continued warming of the global climate will inevitably intensify the retreat of glaciers. In the event of an avalanche, excess melted snow will form a torrent and rush towards the mountain villa at the foot of Mount Everest. In the past 20 years, flash floods caused by avalanches on Mount Everest have washed away many Nepali villages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/Ppbwun05bkWz2O9tFNqnLd1Ov4tJoq8if0MEI2FY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2599&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/Ppbwun05bkWz2O9tFNqnLd1Ov4tJoq8if0MEI2FY.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251358&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The lady raised her fluttering silk scarf into the wind&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Dashi/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;This is the starting point of this trip, an observation of global climate change centered on the scientific expedition to Mount Everest.

Between the mountains, the Nu River, Lancang River and Jinsha River flow side by side in three canyons with a horizontal distance of only more than 60 kilometers. Under the sunlight, they look like yellow veins. When the plane landed slowly, I saw Shangri-La in the green valley like a spilled palette, flowing beside the Napa Sea wetland. The flowing cloud shadows are reflected on the water surface of the wetland, which is like a dream. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Lwz0dAOvw8iuPEN7OTb46QFWpvHn8s5f7SkFxZ2r.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;577&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Lwz0dAOvw8iuPEN7OTb46QFWpvHn8s5f7SkFxZ2r.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252052&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Napahai Wetland&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The center of Shangri-La City is An ancient city named &quot;Dukezong&quot; was originally built by the Tubo people and means &quot;Moonlight City&quot; in Tibetan. Since its construction, it has been abandoned and rebuilt several times, and its organizational structure, zoning and name have been changed several times, but its status as the political, economic and cultural center of Diqing, Yunnan has remained unchanged. For thousands of years, this place has witnessed not only the smoke of wars, but also the bustle of tea and horse trade. It has also been the link between Yunnan, Sichuan, and Tibet&#39;s &quot;Grand Triangle&quot; and a channel for frequent exchanges among various ethnic groups. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2014, an unexpected fire partially burned down the ancient city of Dukezong. Today, the ancient city has slowly recovered. Strolling along the stone road in the ancient city, you will see wooden houses on both sides, operating inns, restaurants, bars or handicraft shops. It reminds people of the &quot;quaint little town&quot; described by the British botanist Kingdon Ward. In 1913, in order to investigate the rivers and plants in the Hengduan Mountains, Kingdon Ward passed by this place and stayed in a house. He found that &quot;the house was extremely clean, and the copper cooking pots and tea utensils were polished to a discernible shine.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kindon Ward was not the only one to leave written records for Shangri-La. Liu Manqing, the first &quot;female imperial envoy&quot; to Tibet in modern times and known as the &quot;Fantastic Woman of the East&quot;, wrote about the ancient city of Dukezong in a delicate way in &quot;The Campaign of Kangzang&quot; published in 1933:&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;When the sky dawns or the sun sets, the streets are full of people carrying water. The ladles for collecting water are made of folded bark. They are light in weight and large in capacity. , beside the spring, water seekers swarm like ants.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, at the foot of Dagui Mountain, the spring mentioned by Liu Manqing is still gurgling. Someone placed a water ladle next to the spring for passers-by to get water and taste it. The sun passes through the transparent water, and the waves dance under the water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since ancient times, Shangri-La has been a legend on the Tea Horse Road. At that time, there were more than 190 businesses traveling between Shangri-La and Lhasa alone, and more than 20,000 caravan horses passed through each year. In the alley of Dukezong Ancient City, I met the handsome Kham man Zhabagdan. Zhabagdan&#39;s father is from Shangri-La and was a member of a caravan when he was young. In 1970, Zhabagdan was born in a small mountain village in India. He worked as a monk for seven years. When he was seventeen, he returned to his hometown with his father. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhabagdan’s life legend begins in Shangri-La. After returning to China, he started studying in the first grade of primary school and later studied in Austria and the United States. He speaks Tibetan, English and Hindi, as well as a curry-flavored version of Mandarin. He has worked part-time as a civil servant, a tour guide, and opened a travel agency and restaurant. In 2012, Zhabagdan created the first &quot;Arokangba&quot; B&amp;B in the ancient city of Dukezong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Aruo Kamba&quot; is a sentence used by our fathers to greet each other while walking on the Ancient Tea Horse Road, which means &quot;Come on, friend&quot;. Creating &quot;Aro Kamba&quot; was not only Zhabagdan&#39;s father&#39;s dream during his lifetime, but also his own dream. Back then, the caravans walked on the Tea-Horse Ancient Road. Whenever they were exhausted, they would get a chance to rest in &quot;Naicang&quot; deep in the mountains. Every time my father mentioned the story of the caravan to Zhabagdan, he would always talk about the &quot;Naicang&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fire in 2014 severely damaged the ancient city. Although Arokamba Manor survived, the memory left by the fire in Zhabagdan has never faded. He still clearly remembered the shops and houses shrouded in fire, falling tragically like defenseless giants. The sound of explosions of liquefied gas tanks came one after another, and clouds of fireworks rolled up. The flying fragments hit the broken walls and made various sharp sounds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This was like a one-sided war. We were caught off guard in the face of the rapid fire.&quot; Zhabagdan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What makes Zhabagdan happy is that over the years, through the reconstruction of &quot;building the new as the old, replacing the old with the old, and imitating the old with the new&quot;, the ancient city of Dukezong has gradually restored its original appearance. What was once a devastated place has been replaced by a brand new look. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Stone streets, unique Tibetan inns, handicraft shops with ethnic colors, cafes and bars full of literary and artistic atmosphere, indicate that the ancient Dukezong city is back.&quot;&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;For Shangri-La, Zhabagdan has always had love and confidence. He still often thinks of the time when he and his father climbed over a pass and saw Shangri-La for the first time: &quot;That was a scroll painting that appeared countless times in my dreams.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/sbYkZP7IVmGI7grn25WnatoRXqkht9E7KSjwkhxB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;/ /images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/sbYkZP7IVmGI7grn25WnatoRXqkht9E7KSjwkhxB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252051&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center ;&quot;>;Songzanlin Temple&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Shangri-La is the imagination of the whole world&quot;&lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After leaving Shangri-La, we headed towards Deqin along the Yunnan-Tibet Line and stayed overnight in Benzilan Town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Benzilan is located on the right bank of the upper reaches of the Jinsha River. It means &quot;little sand dam&quot; in Tibetan. It is a valley area between the surging Jinsha River and steep mountains. However, as the altitude decreases, the scenery of the valley becomes desolate: gravel and barren soil on both sides, and exposed rocks. Just now, you could still see tall broad-leaved forests, a lush scene, but gradually they turned into low shrubs and cacti. The wind blew on my face, it was hot and dry, making me feel like I was in the desert of Mexico. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This &quot;hot and dry valley&quot; scene is a typical geological landscape in the &quot;Three Parallel Rivers&quot; area, and it can be called a wonderful stroke of nature: the warm and moist airflow becomes cold as it climbs over the mountains on both sides of the canyon in the wind. It triggers precipitation, so rainfall is frequent on the top of the mountain and vegetation is lush. The airflow descends through the leeward slope and becomes hot, and when it reaches the valley bottom, it becomes a dry and hot &quot;Foehn wind&quot;. The &quot;Foehn wind&quot; intensifies the degree of dry heat, causing the vegetation to become sparser, forming a &quot;hot dry valley&quot; landform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the &quot;Hot Dry Valley&quot; is by no means completely desolate. Through the car window, you can see ocher-colored mountains studded with agate-like terraces. By transforming these terraces, local people have created local environments suitable for farming. Walnuts, citrus, grapes, watermelons and olives are planted on the platform, complementing the tawny Jinsha River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After passing Benzilan Town, we left the road, followed the stream, passed through the valley, and arrived at the peaceful Bairen Village. Cacti grow among the exposed rocks, and pepper and plum trees grow along the roadside. The person I want to visit is Estelle Achard, a French female architect. Nine years ago, this French woman from the foot of the Alps sold her hut in northern France, came to this Tibetan village deep in the river valley alone, and opened an inn called &quot;Tulu Lodge&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Dirt Road&quot; was renovated from an old Tibetan-style house in the village, and the original appearance has been maintained as much as possible: plum trees and pomegranate trees are planted in the small yard surrounded by earth and stone walls. , rosemary and mint grow in stone flower beds. Estelle went out to greet us, followed by two dogs (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;One ​​of them is a blind dog&lt;/span>;), spinning around our feet excitedly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Estelle has ash-brown hair, glasses, and a Tibetan necklace hanging around her neck. Thirty years ago, when she was an architect, she came to Yunnan on a business trip for the first time and couldn&#39;t help but fall in love with the mountains and rivers here. Fifteen years later, she moved to Kunming. After working in hotel design for a few years, she moved to Shangri-La and finally settled in Benzilan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Estelle takes us through the rooms she designed and decorated one by one. Although each room has a different style, they all organically combine national characteristics with modern concepts, as if time has quietly settled here. When renovating the house, Estelle values ​​​​the most ecological and environmental protection concepts. She kept the wood as bare as possible and did not use chemical-based varnishes. She also deliberately preserved the &quot;dry toilet&quot; in rural areas: a hole was made in the ground of the toilet, a chair was placed above the hole, the seat was hollowed out, and there was a pile of sawdust under the hole, and the excrement fell directly into the sawdust and became Fertilizer for the vegetable patch outside the yard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having lived in Benzilan for nearly ten years, Estelle can communicate with the villagers in Chinese, and the villagers call her &quot;French Ajia&quot;. She likes local ghee, yak meat, and fresh vegetables and fruits, and she grows various herbs needed for French cuisine in the garden. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That night, we sat under the plum tree in the garden and shared a country dinner made by Estelle with a French family traveling to Diqing: tomato and watermelon cold soup, spice roasted chicken, mashed potatoes, served with Shangri-La products red wine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The corn leaves outside the courtyard swayed in the evening breeze, and the sound of the stream became louder. We talked about our respective experiences. Estelle said that she also thought about opening a B&amp;B in Provence, but Provence was already too saturated. She was very happy to settle down in Benzilan and open a small B&amp;B. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Provence is the imagination of the whole world, and it is the same here.&quot; Estelle said, &quot;Whenever I tell my French friends that I have settled in Shangri-La, they will exclaim!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Q1PcGm7rADXzIUj537SZW8Xgt8f84vX66AiWDkEi.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data -src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Q1PcGm7rADXzIUj537SZW8Xgt8f84vX66AiWDkEi.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252056&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Jinsha River Big Bend&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liu Zichao/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Xueshan Market Dunshiyang&quot; &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Early the next morning, we left Benzilan, left the dry and hot valley, and walked along the Jinsha River. The elevation of the road rises again, and the vegetation on the mountains becomes lush again. At the big bend of the Jinsha River, I saw the yellow river water turning around, like a man&#39;s bent arms, full of power - the mountains sandwiching the river water were like the guardian angel of the river. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is 86 kilometers from Benzilan to Deqin County. Although the mountain road is winding, it is in good condition. Before liberation, there were no roads in Deqin County, and it was not until 1959 that the Yunnan-Tibet Highway was built. At that time, it was necessary to climb the Baima Snow Mountain, which is more than 4,000 meters above sea level. From October to May of the following year, traffic was often blocked due to heavy snowfall. Now that the tunnel has been opened, it is no longer necessary to cross the pass of Baima Snow Mountain. Our car seemed to be gliding on the road, surrounded by dense forests on both sides. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The town of Deqin County used to be called Adunzi. It is said that during the Song and Yuan Dynasties, the eminent Tibetan Buddhist monk Karmapa discovered during meditation that Kawagbo, the main peak of Meili Snow Mountain, was the holy land of Chakrasamvara predicted by Padmasambhava. This started the pilgrimage of Tibetan Buddhists to Kawagebo. the first of its kind. Adunzi is not only the starting point and the end point of worshiping the sacred mountain, but also an important material distribution center and cultural exchange center on the Tea Horse Road. Therefore, it has the reputation of &quot;Snow Mountain Market&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a broader perspective, Adunzi is located in the contact zone between the Han and Tibetan peoples. As scholars say, just as Zhangjiakou&#39;s commercial development is due to its location in the contact zone between the Han and Mongolian peoples, Adunzi&#39;s commercial development is also due to the same reason. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the Anti-Japanese War, traditional international trade routes were blocked, and merchants gathered in Adunzi, which became a bridge to maintain Sino-Indian trade and transport war preparation materials. Due to the large number of major business houses, in order to facilitate transactions, merchants used a &quot;Dunshiyang&quot; currency as a medium of circulation. This kind of currency can only be used in Adunzi market, which shows the prosperity of Adunzi in those days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, Deqin has restored the appearance of a small mountain town, with buildings winding down the valley, with a drop of nearly 600 meters. Walking on the street, I can&#39;t see the prosperous scene of the Tea Horse Station back then. It looks more like an ordinary mountain city. Only the skin color of passers-by, their accents, and the attire of some residents made me realize that I was in a minority area inhabited by Tibetans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to its location in a narrow ravine, the biggest risk faced by Deqin County in recent years is mudslides. In 2003, the Diqing Prefecture government considered moving the county seat elsewhere. In 2010, a mudslide occurred in Zhouqu County, Gansu Province, which has similar terrain, which aroused people&#39;s concerns about Deqin. But local people told me that the mountains near Deqin are undulating, and it is very difficult to find a piece of flat land that is open enough. Therefore, the government’s latest consideration is to relocate the entire county seat to the adjacent Weixi County. If this is the case, the ancient city of Adunzi will also will become a piece of history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/DkyjOuuGVwfs4clUEE2QKRrwezqYeWvqNdy8pplL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/DkyjOuuGVwfs4clUEE2QKRrwezqYeWvqNdy8pplL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252053&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Kawagbo, the main peak of Meili Snow Mountain, and the Mingyong Glacier flows below the snow peak. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Mingyong Glacier is protected by Mingyong Village&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;In the early morning, we went to Feilai Temple to watch the sacred scene of &quot;Rizhao Jinshan&quot; - the golden sunshine hitting the Kawagebo Mountain Peak. Then we returned to Deqin County and met the poet Tashi Nyima in a Tibetan restaurant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tashi Nyima was born in Mingyong Village under the jurisdiction of Deqin County. This village is located under the Kawagebo Snow Peak, which means &quot;mirror&quot; in Tibetan. It is named after the huge glacier pouring down from the snow-capped mountains behind the village. In addition to Mingyong Glacier, Mingyong Village is also the place where the late poet Ma Hua taught. There, Ma Hua wrote the collection of poems &quot;Snow Mountain Short Songs&quot;, which was praised by critics as the clearest and clearest part of contemporary Chinese poetry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After lunch, I asked Tashi Nyima to take me to Mingyong Village. We got in the car and got on National Highway 214, and soon saw the roaring Lancang River. The landscape here is also a dry and hot valley, but I found that wherever there are terraces and slopes, there are pastoral houses, and you can see the waves of wheat rolling and the fragrance of melons and fruits. Driving on this road, you will see oases and residential houses embedded in the landscape drawn by snow-capped mountains, canyons and rivers, which is refreshing and refreshing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Along the way, in the passes and fields on both sides of the river valley, you can see towering earthen watchtowers from time to time. Most of them are dilapidated and dilapidated, full of the vicissitudes of history. I asked Tashi Nyima, when were these watchtowers built? What is it used for? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tashi Nyima told me that due to the passage of time, even the locals have lost their memory of the watchtowers. Whether they were for the purpose of war or just a symbol of wealth and status, historians and archaeologists disagree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/p9243QxUuIDpc0hJ7oun65LznBcxdNO3VKSmFwf8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/p9243QxUuIDpc0hJ7oun65LznBcxdNO3VKSmFwf8.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252055&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tibetan village under Meili Snow Mountain&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Leading to Mingyong The road in the village was opened in April 1998. In the past, the only way to enter and exit Mingyong Village was by taking the path on the cliff. In Tashi Nyima’s memory, the sound of the Mingyong River was louder than it is now. He goes to school, a half-day walk and a zip line. During the summer vacation, he went to the mountains to herd sheep. When he was hungry, he roasted the matsutake mushrooms collected from the forest, sprinkled them with salt and chili, and ate them. Now it seems that all this is a &quot;rare experience in life.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, the life of the people in Mingyong Village was very difficult. In most families, the whole family sleeps on the same bunk, and there are not even extra bowls at home. Zhaxinima remembers that when he was in junior high school, he once went home for a vacation and invited his classmates to have lunch at home. Since there were no guest bowls at home, he had to use a family member&#39;s bowl, which was only deformed - his father once went up the mountain to chop wood and fell, causing the wooden bowl to become deformed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After graduating from junior high school, Tashi Nyima went to a normal school to study, and then moved around villages and towns under the jurisdiction of Deqin County. In 1997, he was transferred to the Deqin County Tourism Bureau and participated in the preparation of the development plan for the Meili Snow Mountain Ecological Tourism Zone. It was that plan that made Mingyong Glacier a priority scenic spot for development, and the great changes in Mingyong Village began at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the government&#39;s vigorous promotion, Kawagebo Peak and Mingyong Glacier have begun to attract more and more tourists. Deqin County seized the opportunity and invested more than 70 million yuan to build infrastructure for Mingyong Village. Mingyong Glacier became the first national 4A-level scenic spot in Deqing Prefecture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the glacier tourism development, the villagers of Mingyong Village are mainly involved in providing horse-drawn services for tourists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Mules and horses have become the money bag of Mingyong Village.” Zhaxinima said, “In 1999, the average income from horse pulling was 8,700 yuan per household; by 2006, the average income per household exceeded We paid 50,000 yuan.&quot; The villagers have become rich in the tourism industry, and every household has purchased satellite TV, refrigerators, washing machines, and high-end stereos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, the county proposed the implementation of the glacier cableway project. Because the cost of raising mules and horses is not small, building a ropeway may bring more tourists. The villagers believe that by signing a contract with the ropeway company and negotiating a share of the profits, they can earn money comfortably without having to worry about feeding the mules and horses and safety issues. Since the Glacier Cableway was put into operation, each villager household has been able to receive at least 55,000 yuan in dividends every year. Mingyong Village has changed from a poor village in the past to a wealthy village in Deqin County and even Diqing Prefecture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/28wqjxJHLY65YACM1aD5eZvh0cGqRmvFrKmzkn7e.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/28wqjxJHLY65YACM1aD5eZvh0cGqRmvFrKmzkn7e.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252054&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Deqin Yubeng Village&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the afternoon, I and I Walking with Tashi Nyima in Mingyong Village. I saw that every household had built a two-story Tibetan-style house with a yard, and the white walls were dotted among the green forests and fields. Kawagebo Peak is right in front of you, and the glacier extends from the chest of the main peak to the forest at an altitude of 2,660 meters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tashi Nyima told me that according to the old people in Mingyong Village, you could see the glacier and feel the cool air of the glacier when you opened the window. At that time, the glaciers were very &quot;strong&quot; and filled the valley, and you could hear the loud noise of the glaciers cracking all day long. In 1913, the British botanist King Dun Ward also visited the Mingyong Glacier and saw &quot;a huge icicle shaking like a drunkard, roaring and rolling down the valley in an instant, startling a group of green parrots on the tree.&quot; rise&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tashi Nyima said that when he was a child, the outlet of the glacier would be blocked by falling ice, and the river would suddenly stop flowing. Village women would go to the edge of the glacier and raise their voices. Sing &quot;Mani Tune&quot;. As they sang, the ice cubes were broken open and the river water surged out. However, the glaciers have gradually receded over the years, which makes Tashi Nyima feel heavy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Every time I return to the village, I feel that the glacier has become smaller.” Zasinima said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To this end, he also filmed a documentary called &quot;Glacier&quot;, which expressed the Tibetan people&#39;s belief in the snow-capped mountains and their influence on foreign culture from three perspectives: pilgrims, tourists, and villagers. Different understandings, and the various confusions they face in the wave of tourism development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/S3QpLt5MKOUgTjgGiunNeUQ3OTyxymWfgcs0sdcy.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/S3QpLt5MKOUgTjgGiunNeUQ3OTyxymWfgcs0sdcy.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252057&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In the Shangri-La region, peach blossoms bloom under the snow-capped mountains.

On the front and back, it is written in Chinese and Tibetan: &quot;Ma Hua, poet and scholar. Born on April 11, 1972, male, Han nationality, from Tianjin. He graduated from the International Politics Department of Fudan University in Shanghai. In March 2003, he went to Mingyong Village Primary School to teach on a voluntary basis.

There are also many people who are eager to travel and use third-party platforms&#39; &quot;Light Speed ​​Ticket Grabbing&quot; and &quot;Ticket Grabbing Magic Tool&quot;. Tickets usually cost extra. In this regard, Railway 12306 issued a statement through its official Weibo, stating that it has never authorized any third-party platform to sell train tickets, and it is impossible to give third-party platforms the so-called &quot;priority to purchase tickets.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The statement said: &quot;Third-party platforms will retain user information during the ticket purchase process of passengers and friends. Not only are there traps such as surcharges, acceleration packages, bundled sales services, etc., but there may also be risks of personal information leakage. Please Passengers must purchase tickets through official railway channels, look for the railway 12306 website (including the client), and pay attention to protecting legitimate rights and interests and the security of personal information.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to understand the true meaning of this statement? Will &quot;ticket-grabbing tools&quot; lose their market? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, we must understand why for many years, it is difficult to get a ticket for high-speed rail on many lines during long holidays. But first, starting from this year, the shortage of tickets on some lines may change. And turn down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The use intensity of high-speed rail passengers on different lines is different. Some lines are more popular, with constant demand for commuting, business travel, tourism, etc., and there are many trains every day, such as between cities in the Pearl River Delta or Yangtze River Delta regions. There are lines between major urban agglomerations, as well as lines to popular attractions; some lines are not so popular and have relatively few flights. During the long holidays, in order to cope with the surge in travel demand, the high-speed rail will open some additional trains. However, it is obvious that the former will increase the absolute demand and relative demand much more, but the potential for additional operations is limited; the latter has great potential for additional operations, but the increase demand is limited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, for a long time, most high-speed rail lines have had the same price during normal times and long holidays, which often leads to the following consequences: when demand is low during normal times, the fare is higher than the market equilibrium price; during long holidays When demand increases sharply, ticket prices are significantly lower than the market equilibrium price, causing tickets to sell out as soon as they are released. The National Railway is well aware of this situation, so it is also making improvements to make fares more market-oriented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2020, the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway began to implement floating fares. The highest second-class fare for the entire journey was 598 yuan, an increase of 8%; the lowest fare was 498 yuan, a decrease of 10%, that is, the upper limit was increased. , the lower limit is lowered, which is the first time in the nine years since the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway was opened that a floating fare mechanism has been implemented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Starting from May 30, 2023, the railway department will conduct &quot;fare inspections&quot; on many high-speed rail lines such as the Shanghai-Nanjing Intercity, Nanjing-Hangzhou High-speed Railway, Nan-Guangzhou High-speed Railway, Jiaoji Passenger Line, and Liunan Passenger Line. &quot;Optimization adjustment&quot;, the upper limit is the published fare, the lower limit is 34% of the published fare, the upper limit is further increased, the lower limit is lowered, and the floating range is further relaxed. Taking the Shanghai-Nanjing Intercity as an example, the published fare for second-class seats from Nanjing Station to Shanghai Station is 166 yuan, which is the highest fare after adjustment, an increase of 19% from the pre-adjusted fare of 139.5 yuan; the lowest fare is 110 yuan. The fare dropped by 21% from the 139.5 yuan before adjustment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to raising and floating the fare caps on some popular lines, the railway department has also launched discount tickets. China Railway Guangzhou Bureau Group announced that &quot;in order to facilitate intercity passengers&#39; business travel and commuting travel&quot;, starting from June 20, 2023, the Changsha-Zhuzhou-Tanzhou Intercity Railway will officially launch regular tickets and time-counted tickets. Passengers can Take the S-shaped train running on the route at the designated departure station. Take the 60-time/30-day regular ticket from Chengdu East to Chongqing West priced at 5,852 yuan, which is equivalent to 97.5 yuan per time, which is close to the lowest operating fare for ordinary tickets, with a discount of up to 52%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The general trend is that the pricing strategy of high-speed rail is in line with that of airplanes. Unless there is an emergency, as long as you buy a ticket some time in advance, you can basically buy a ticket, and even the price is very favorable. This is because the air ticket will be set at a high &quot;original price&quot;, which is much higher than the market equilibrium most of the time. The price does not go up, but only goes down, with discounts of 30% or 40% off, giving passengers a sense of gain. This is a pricing strategy that is purely market-oriented and accurately grasps the psychology of passengers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The pricing strategy of high-speed trains is completely copied from that of air tickets. Starting from September 15th, high-speed trains will go on sale during the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holidays. When purchasing tickets, many people found that compared with normal times, some high-speed trains and trains and trains increased significantly during the National Day holiday. A passenger posted on social media that a dormitory ticket from Beijing to Shenzhen only costs 1,150 yuan on weekdays, but on September 28 the upper berth price increased to 1,860 yuan and the lower berth price increased to 2,090 yuan. On the same day, the lowest direct fare from Beijing to Shenzhen is 1,100 yuan (excluding tax). On the official website, the published fare for Beijing to Shenzhen is 2,264 yuan, with discounts of 1,860 yuan and 2,090 yuan, approximately 12% off and 92% off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, floating fares are not yet implemented on all lines. If you cannot get tickets during the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, it only means that the fares are still low relative to demand. For this line Either fixed fares are still being implemented, or floating fares are not in place. This is the explanation from economics. And this means that the &quot;ticket-grabbing artifact&quot; still has room for survival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“抢票神器”的本质就是数字黄牛，当一种商品的官方价格显著低于市场均衡价格之时，这差价就是“无主收入”，许多人就有动机争夺这收入，黄牛就是其中一种，勤快的早早排队赚辛苦钱，有门路的搞到内部票，所得与内部人分成。数字黄牛也是黄牛，不过如果第三方平台宣称有“优先购票权”，那是骗人的，你购买加速包，人家也是帮你去12306买票。在这个意义上，铁路部门的澄清是很有必要的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，用算法抢、用App抢肯定比手速快，这就是“抢票神器”的市场生态位。铁路部门的澄清也劝返不了归心似箭、求票心切的乘客。当然，12306可以封禁某些频频刷票的IP甚至App本身，但也很难把机刷买票完全排除，只留下手刷买票。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所谓“道高一尺，魔高一丈”，只要有利益空间在，技术会不断进化的。所以治本之策，仍是票价进一步市场化，让乘客的出价尽可能反映自己的需求强度。这样一天都等不得特别想去某个地方的人总能去，觉得缓一两天无所谓的也能省一笔钱，各得其宜；高铁也能赚更多的钱，以支付高铁运行成本、造价乃至银行本息，数字黄牛自然没有了生存空间。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;说汪顺“不行”的声音，直到亚运会比赛前还存在。两个月前的游泳世锦赛，汪顺在报名的三项比赛中，均未能进入决赛，距离曾经的巅峰状态差距不小。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;9月24日，亚运会当天的预赛中，汪顺游出1分58秒84的成绩，这与世锦赛获得第11名的成绩(1分57秒97)仍有差距，而队友覃海洋以领先汪顺0.12秒的成绩位列第一晋级当晚的决赛。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后的决赛，汪顺一路领先获得金牌，同时打破由他保持的亚洲纪录(1分55秒00)，此前这一纪录是他在东京奥运会创造的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“就好像我（本来）就会游泳一样，”汪顺和这片蓝色泳池的故事，从5岁那年的夏天开始。他跟着父亲第一次去游泳馆戏水，看见父亲跃入泳池，他紧跟着往下跳。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;身体下沉，手忙脚乱，想抓住点什么，汪顺很快呛了水，但他不觉得害怕，“我没有觉得被水呛到了，就要远离它，反而很想去征服它。也许，我对水有一种天生的亲密感。在水里面，我感受到了前所未有的快乐、放松，如鱼得水。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;汪顺的过往战绩中的确有如鱼得水的标记：1994年出生于浙江宁波，2007年被朱志根教练选中，进入浙江省一队；2009年，跟随教练朱志根进入中国游泳队二队；2010年广州亚运会，成为男子200米个人混合泳亚军；2016年，国际泳联短池游泳世锦赛男子200米个人混合泳夺冠，获得男子混合泳中国首个世界冠军；2021年7月30日，获得东京奥运会男子200米混合泳冠军。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但在水里，并不可能总是顺流而下。东京奥运会夺冠后，汪顺一度失去了目标，觉得无法再从游泳中获得快乐。在奥运会的赛场上升国旗奏国歌，是汪顺过去二十多年运动生涯里的终极目标。他很早就说过，“做运动员一定要有清晰的目标”，从全国冠军游到世界冠军，再游到奥运冠军，他逐级提升自己的竞技成绩，“我一直给自己打气，好成绩得来不易，都是一步一个脚印。”&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;2023年7月，日本福冈游泳世锦赛。汪顺感觉找回了动力，希望忘掉奥运冠军的光环，继续超越自我，填补自己金牌大满贯（奥运会、亚运会、短池世锦赛和长池世锦赛）的最后一个缺口——长池世锦赛冠军。然而，汪顺在这次比赛的男子200米混合泳预赛中排名第16，差点被淘汰；半决赛排名第11，无缘决赛。在400米混合泳中，他因为犯规被取消成绩。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;汪顺还行吗？这样的疑问来自外界，也来自他的内心。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从福冈世锦赛到杭州亚运会，间隔时间只有不到两个月，汪顺一直在调整状态。他今年29岁了，这已经是他第四次参加亚运会。2010年广州亚运会时，汪顺还是新人，那是他第一次站在亚运会的舞台上，与亚洲对手们在同一个泳池竞技，今天回想起来“依然热血澎湃”。但汪顺不再是只有热血的新手，他有过巅峰，也经历了漫长时间里的起起伏伏，最终选择再次跃入泳池。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/YyS7jrnSTVUFm4UEWNKEYfmq7BgIQNYuhlpP1dXn.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;第一次面对关于泳池的选择时，汪顺还是个小孩子。那时他正在学习画画，表现不错，同时收到了游泳队的橄榄枝。要不要选择成为职业游泳运动员，家里没有过这样的先例，是本能也是冒险，他选了泳池。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“游泳一直给我一种前进的感觉。”成年后，汪顺这样解释自己的选择。当时间足够漫长，他经历并感受了越来越多游泳运动的另一面：枯燥、重复、与自我对抗。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在长50米、宽25米、有着8条泳道的泳池里游泳，不厌其烦地一次次往返于起点和终点之间。他说：“游泳是一项比较枯燥的运动，在竞技过程中，在日常训练中，很少能够跟别人交流。唯一能够听到的是水流滑向你，流过耳朵的声音是我最亲密的伙伴。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;汪顺曾在一次采访中无意间说起，2022年有7个月的时间，他都在基地训练，就像搭积木一样，每天从基础训练开始，一堂训练课游13000-16000米，有时连续练上两三堂训练课，到边、转身、翻滚、折返，一整套的水中动作循环重复着。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他的手看上去瘦削，指节分明，掌心却结下了粗糙老茧。头两年刚训练的时候，他手上的皮肤会因在水中泡得太久而起皱。时间一长，身体逐渐适应，“表象的反应基本上没有了”。长期的、固定的训练也改变了他的日常。“我休假的时候，一天还好，如果第二天没有去游泳池下水，会浑身不舒服。只要到了泳池，我就会很舒服，现在对水会有这样的情感。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了身体的训练之外，面对自己的内心，同样是这条赛道的必修课。2019年世锦赛，汪顺非常渴望收获一枚金牌，但他甚至没有发挥出自己的正常水平。3个月后的世界军人运动会，汪顺渴望不减，“一定要证明自己。”他拼命增加训练难度，结果却因为训练过量导致肺部破裂，出现了气胸。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当时医生给他的治疗方案是每天吸氧一小时，而他却希望尽快恢复，为国争光，于是开始每天吸氧两小时。即便如此，医生还是建议他放弃那次比赛再休息一周.他不肯，在床上躺了五天之后，重新站回训练场，并在隔天的比赛中拼尽全力，拿到冠军。如今回忆起当时的情况他还是心有戚戚：“很多事情大家可能看不到，对我来说是玩命一样吧。”&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;此后的巅峰时刻，当数东京奥运会。夺冠当日，汪顺在微博上写道：“虽然我叫顺，但其实并不顺。今天我想对我的教练说，我做到了我们的约定！夺冠并非终点，走下领奖台，一切从零开始，我们巴黎见……”从里约铜牌到东京金牌，汪顺描述那种感觉“妙不可言”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我要仔仔细细地看着它，”汪顺说，那块（金牌）很重，这是对自己这么多年来的认可，“我要仔仔细细地看看它，我是为了什么——就是为了它我才一直拼搏。我觉得它比我想象的重量要重得多。大家虽然只是看到了一块金牌，但是我的人生都包含在这里面了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;巅峰之后，经历低谷，杭州亚运会，汪顺再次证明了自己，以更加饱满的心态。赛后接受采访时，被问到有没有超预期，汪顺表示，“超预期了，原来预计56秒以内，没想到今天打破了亚洲纪录”，有记者调侃“是不是昨天点火给了你力量”，汪顺回答：是家乡父老给了我力量。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就在夺冠前一晚，9月23日，杭州亚运会开幕式上，汪顺与“数字人火炬手”共同点燃亚运会主火炬，作为最后一名火炬手，他成为亚运史经典一幕的现场见证者。而赛场也见证了汪顺游泳生涯的起起伏伏。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;回望这漫漫长途，作为运动员得到的最大满足感是什么?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;汪顺曾在采访中这样回答，“在你竭尽全力后，提升了0.1(秒)或者0.01秒所带给你的快乐感，这是我能制造的最大的满足感。这种满足感不是连贯的，没有人能一直涨成绩，感觉是断断续续的，有好有坏的，就像心电图一样，有起有伏。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他喜欢赛场上的一些微小时刻，“当你回头看向大屏幕上的成绩，发觉你的最佳成绩提升了那么0.1(秒)、0.2(秒)或者0.01(秒)、0.02秒的时候，那一瞬间，会感觉到这段时间的训练没有白白付出。0.1秒，可能挑战了自己的极限，也挑战了人类的极限。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在杭州亚运的赛前采访中，记者问：游泳对你来说意味着什么？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;汪顺回答：“对游泳，小时候是热爱，现在更多的是责任。奥运冠军只是个新起点，自己还要为中国游泳付出更多的努力，期待我能在家门口举办的杭州亚运会上取得好成绩。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这次的成绩过后，如汪顺所想，他还会在自己更加漫长的时间里，一直游下去。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;参考资料：《Glass Magazine》、《时尚先生》、《都市快报》&lt;/p>;
