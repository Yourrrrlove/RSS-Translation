Throughout the 19th century, old Russian literature and painting gradually entered the golden age. Tolstoy to Repin is the intersection of literature and painting.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a &quot;long-planned&quot; exhibition. The coordination and communication work alone lasted more than four years, with many gaps in between. After an epidemic, these precious works were finally officially unveiled on November 11, 2023 in Wuzhen, a water town in the south of the Yangtze River. In order to borrow the exhibition, Chen Danqing contacted the Moscow State Leo Tolstoy Museum in 2018. In a letter to the director, he wrote: At my age, I have no chance to meet Tolstoy himself, but When I write to you now, I feel like I am writing to Tolstoy...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/29/rIqziyHN4h8Rx2pAZxCBw7YjwpIED9AfqFGoOHPM.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;634&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/rIqziyHN4h8Rx2pAZxCBw7YjwpIED9Afq FGoOHPM .jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259999&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Tolstoy in the Plowed Field&quot; (copied from Repin&#39;s original work), published Oil painting, Andreev Vladimir Ivanovich, 1887, collection: State Leo Tolstoy Museum&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;When Repin met Lev&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Chen Danqing said that Mu Xin keeps three or five pictures of world literary figures on his desk all year round, including Tuo Weng. Mu Xin was sincerely convinced of Russian literature and Tolstoy. He once said enviously: Look, that big bearded book is densely packed with literature. But as a painter, Mu Xin looked down on Russian paintings, including Repin. &quot;His paintings are deeply hidden in the world of Fan Kuan and Ni Zan, and he was impatient with the cumbersomeness and complexity of Russian paintings.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;But for me This is another kind of experience. I started reading Tolstoy and copying Repin when I was 13 years old. I never imagined that one day I would be able to see their original works and invite their original works to Wuzhen to share them with everyone. For me Said, this is a very special exhibition.&quot; Chen Danqing said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For generations of Chinese readers, the name Leo Tolstoy carries considerable weight and carries a lot of imagination. He is a &quot;monster in the history of world literature.&quot; In the minds of many people, Tolstoy looks like a tall and tall man, including Repin. When Repin saw Tolstoy for the first time in 1880 in the Bolshoi Alley in Moscow, he was startled and realized that he had been deceived by the pictures and portraits he had seen in the past. He always thought that Tolstoy was a tall noble count, but the Tolstoy in front of him looked like a weirdo and preacher, short and stocky, but with a huge head! He has a beautiful gray beard and wears a long black dress. Repin, who was proficient in painting, soon realized that it was this huge head that made Tolstoy appear tall and burly in portraits - people would judge his height from the usual head-to-body ratio. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rebin also played with the same optical illusion. His Tolstoy still gives people the impression of being tall and towering, coupled with the deep, ascetic expression on his face , to create a sense of moral loftiness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tolstoy left a deep impression on Repin when they met for the first time. Repin later recalled the situation when they met: Tolstoy said excitedly like a speech throughout the whole process. What are you talking about, denouncing the tragedy of injustice in life and people&#39;s consistent indifference. This strange eccentric was also a staunch preacher. &quot;He spoke in a deep, sincere voice... He was excited about something and was in a bad mood. There was a sad tone in his voice. Under the formidable thick eyebrows, there was a serious and penitent expression. Eyes flashing green.&quot; The writer&#39;s strong personality and extremely radical remarks made Repin feel fresh and creepy, &quot;as if we were on the eve of the final judgment.&quot; When he went home that night, he had insomnia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/Q2Uhm806kb5oJ7cXTOAtYV5hLNEMcpTyuiDnybzH.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;691&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/Q2Uhm806kb5oJ7cXTOAtYV5hLNEMcpTyuiDnybzH.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259998&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tolstoy and Repin sitting in armchairs in the hall of Yasnaya Polyana House, photo, Sofia Andreyevna Tolstoy , 1908, Collection: State Leo Tolstoy Museum&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Count who is keen on plowing fields&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Curator Wo from the Moscow State Leo Tolstoy Museum Volosevich Olesia said that when Repin and Tolstoy first met, Tolstoy was nearly 50 years old and Repin was only 35 years old. The achievements can basically be equated with Tolstoy&#39;s achievements in literature, but in the first 10 years of their acquaintance, Repin looked up to Tolstoy as if he were looking up to God. Repin once said: Everything Tolstoy said should be engraved in gold.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ten years after Repin met Tolstoy, he got the opportunity to paint Tolstoy. In 1891, when Repin came to the Polyana Manor where Tolstoy lived, he saw that Tolstoy had become a complete civilian. This count, one of the best in the province, no longer wore formal clothes. He was wearing a black shorts and trousers made of rough and worn fabric. He wore a badly worn white skullcap on his head and wore slippers on his bare feet. But Repin found his appearance even more awe-inspiring than before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tolstoy did not like his private life to be disturbed, nor did he like to have his portrait painted, except for Repin, because Repin was a good friend of his eldest daughter Tatiana. Tatiana herself was an artist, loved painting, and was deeply influenced by Repin. They maintained frank correspondence and friendship for a long time. Tolstoy tolerated Repin painting from his family estate. At first, it was entirely to give face to his beloved daughter, but later, Repin won his approval. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is precisely because of this recognition that Repin was able to contribute an image of Tolstoy other than a literary giant that the world has never seen before: a man who skillfully used a sword and a lasso to drive away the horse gangs. Widow farmer plowing fields. Farm work was Tolstoy&#39;s best entertainment and relaxation - it is said that every time Tolstoy returned to the dining table after farm work, the mud on his legs and the smell of horse manure on his body made the whole family secretly complain, and his wife Sofia would She complained that he ruined her fine carpet and had to open the windows to ventilate the smell so that it would not affect the family&#39;s meal. While Repin was sketching for him, he clearly noticed that the passing farmers and village women expressed puzzlement and sarcastic smiles about the count&#39;s plowing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rebin asked to try plowing. He soon lost the battle. His painter&#39;s hands were unable to cope with the heavy farm work. Repin was very diligent and worked almost all the time at Polyana Manor. He never thought that he was a genius and believed that everything he did was based on hard work. &quot;He didn&#39;t want to waste a minute and was working every moment. He said that I had such a great opportunity and was so close to Tolstoy that I should spend every minute portraying the image of this master.&quot; Lecia said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/FZCTmHWphh1kB6RCDH0OQOH6MhhcubbYYICfaSBf.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;747&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/FZCTmHWphh1kB6RCDH0OQOH6MhhcubbYYICfaSBf.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259997&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Special exhibition &quot;Tolstoy in Repin&#39;s Works&quot; at Muxin Art Museum, handwritten letters from Tolstoy and Repin&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Bathing together and praying together&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It was this kind of personal companionship that allowed Repin to draw Thor working in the fields. Tolstoy, Tolstoy writing in his study, Tolstoy with his family, Tolstoy listening to music, Tolstoy participating in the census, Tolstoy with the poor , Tolstoy in prayer... What is particularly precious is that Tolstoy usually did not let anyone see him praying alone in the forest, but Repin captured this moment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tolstoy allowed Repin to walk two miles with him to take a bath in a very cold river. As soon as he walked out of the courtyard, Tolstoy would take off his old homemade slippers and walk very fast with bare feet. The branches and gravel on the path could not help his calloused feet. Repin had to hurry up and walk slowly. Follow his footsteps. After marching for two miles, they were already sweating profusely when they reached the river. Repin suggested sitting for a quarter of an hour to sweat, and immediately jumping into the ice water would cause you to catch a cold. But Tolstoy had quickly stripped off his clothes and jumped into the river. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This is all prejudice, nothing will happen.&quot; Towen said as he stuck his huge head out of the ice water. Before Repin finished sweating, Tolstoy had already taken a shower, put on his clothes, picked up a basket and went to pick mushrooms. His figure disappearing into the forest left an extraordinary impression on Repin: &quot;He looked like a homeless man carrying a basket in the woods, but also had the air of a soldier&quot; - Repin wrote in his later memoirs . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every time he was in the woods, Tolstoy asked a person to step away for a while. He told Repin that he would stand alone in the deep forest and pray. This kind of monk-like spiritual practice would often pass by without even realizing it. Finally, Repin plucked up the courage and asked if he could hide behind the bushes and sketch his long prayers. He was prepared to be flatly rejected. But Tolstoy said kindly: &quot;Ah, there is nothing immoral about this. And when it comes to using me for painting, I am now like a girl who has lost her virginity and shame. I will not refuse anyone who comes. That&#39;s the thing, no.&quot; Relationship! Paint as long as you need it.&quot; By this point, Repin had completely won Tolstoy&#39;s trust. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the exhibition hall, you can see this painting of Tolstoy in prayer. From the initial sketch to the final oil painting, Repin painted it for a full 10 years. Tolstoy in the painting is as beautiful as Wearing a white robe, barefoot, with his hands in his belt, his expression was solemn and solemn like an ascetic monk. In his pocket, there was a thick book with a red cover. It was unclear whether it was the Bible or not. Tolstoy firmly believed that believers should have real communication with God on a regular basis instead of being rigid in rituals. He denied the superficial rituals of the Orthodox Church. When Repin was finally able to exhibit this painting &quot;Tolstoy Praying&quot; in 1906, Tolstoy was expelled from the religious committee by the Orthodox Church because his views were not in line with the teachings. People who came to the exhibition and young people Students laid flowers around the portrait of Tolstoy who was praying alone, silently expressing their support for Tolstoy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/Y2J1xeElcFjOqQOcDaBbynytPBvfRbV6kPwze542.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;712&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/Y2J1xeElcFjOqQOcDaBbynytPBvfRbV6kPwze542.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260000&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Tolstoy on the Other Side of Life&quot;, oil on canvas, Repin, 1912, collection: State Leo Tolstoy Museum&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;He Drawing Tolstoy after his death&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Rebin played an important role in promoting Tolstoy’s image to the world. It is precisely because of him that Tolstoy’s appearance appeared in Russia He became a well-known icon in many daily necessities: calendars, covers, prints, and even chocolate wrappers... Tolstoy was initially suspicious of the large-scale dissemination of his portrait, and especially disapproved of exposing himself plowing the fields, but Finally he gave in. He said to Repin: I respect your opinion, after all, you are a great painter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What’s interesting is that Repin wrote many times in his memoirs how contagious Tolstoy’s smile was and how high-spirited and happy he was when galloping on his horse. But in his writing, There is no portrait of Tolstoy with a smile. He always has a serious, staring, introspective and profound face. It seems that this is the face of Tolstoy&#39;s spirit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1907, Repin once again returned to Polyana Manor and met Tolstoy in his twilight years. This year Tuo Weng is 79 years old and can still ride a horse and run wildly. Repin once again painted him. This important portrait, completed in 1909, almost freezes for us the last appearance of Tolstoy during his lifetime. He was sitting in a pink armchair. His beard and hair were white, his face was majestic, simple and solemn, his eyes were distant and almost transparent, and he seemed to have seen things that mortals could not see. Repin did not draw the piano next to Tolstoy, nor did he draw the person playing the piano. His Tolstoy may be listening to music, or he may just be immersed in his own world through music. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is how Repin described Tolstoy&#39;s appearance in the last years of his life: &quot;looks like a Scythian chief&quot;, &quot;an unshakable look - a living statue of the Stone Age&quot;, &quot;How strange! High cheekbones, a rough nose chopped by an ax and a chisel, a long unkempt beard, big ears...the eyebrows on the eyes are like carapace, the appearance is majestic and terrifying, majestic. However, this chief and his followers They have long since destroyed any tools for the promotion of violence, and their arms are only the docile belief in defending a peaceful life and a free spirit.&quot; Lev Nikolayevich (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Tolstoy&lt;/span>;) himself showed with his own personality and complexion that the spirit has triumphed over the selfish desires of life. His eyes shine with the bright light of this victory.&quot; &quot;He understands everything and forgives everything. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this period, Tolstoy, with his selfless love for the poor and his thoughts on social injustice, was preparing for the liberation of the serfs, dispersing his family wealth and finally running away. Repin felt that it was precisely because of his long-term communication with God that this old man, who was once full of frightening passion, became calm in the last stage of his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;You have to pay attention to these two paintings, this portrait (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Tolstoy sitting in a pink armchair&quot; &quot;&lt;/span>;) was painted by Repin a year before Tolstoy&#39;s death. After Tolstoy&#39;s death, he painted another ( ;&quot;>;&quot;Tolstoy on the Other Side of Life&quot;&lt;/span>;), Tolstoy is in heaven, Tolstoy went to see God.&quot; Chen Danqing pointed to the two most eye-catching masterpieces in the exhibition hall, and Between these two masterpieces hangs Repin&#39;s self-portrait. &quot;In this exhibition hall, when you stare at Repin, please note that more than a hundred years ago, this painter was staring at the great Tolstoy.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two paintings are far apart in the exhibition hall, on the left The pink armchair, corresponding to the pink flowers on the right, Tolstoy stood in the pink glow, standing with his hands down, as if he had confessed everything to God and the world, the light of heaven reflected on his face, a picture The face is not human, it is old, but it is new again. Among all Tolstoy&#39;s paintings by Repin, there has never been one with so many dazzling bright colors. Tolstoy stared at the sky in the brightness and once again saw things that we cannot see. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sketch, sketch, sketch repeatedly, and then create oil paintings based on the sketch. Before that, this was Repin&#39;s path to realist painting. A series of small drafts and sketches about Tolstoy in Polyana cross-corroborated this faithful path. This is also the path of Russian painting and Russian literature. However, there is no evidence that Tolstoy posed for the portrait &quot;Tolstoy on the Other Side of Life&quot; during his lifetime. The realist master Repin lost his model after his death, but in the end he painted the appearance of Tolstoy&#39;s soul. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 04 Dec 2023 10:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[重庆检察机关依法对焦小平涉嫌受贿案提起公诉]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261795]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-04 10:07:08&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The reporter learned from the Supreme People’s Procuratorate today (4th) that the former Party Committee Standing Committee and Deputy Commander of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps The case of Jiao Xiaoping, former deputy general manager of China New Construction Group Corporation, suspected of accepting bribes, was investigated and concluded by the National Supervisory Commission.

The filming scene at the entrance of a hotel in Hengdian showed a male actor slapping an actress. Southern Weekend reporter Zhao Mingshe&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Notice - when the news of the rectification of micro-short dramas came, freelance screenwriter Deng Zhuye had just returned to Dali from a visit to Hengdian. She received a reminder from the creator&#39;s WeChat group. Realize the seriousness of the problem: you cannot be careless and must take it seriously. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Experiencing the critical moment of this industry, while she was adjusting the script urgently, she could still feel that the entire short drama market was still booming. &quot;Everything is lacking, and the producers keep asking me to recommend writers.&quot; Deng Zhuye said that the country&#39;s introduction of governance measures shows that the market size of short dramas has begun to receive attention from the outside world. &quot;If it can be regulated in the future, it can develop for a long time, which is a good thing.&quot; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of November 15, 2023, the China Online Audiovisual Program Service Association published an article stating that the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television will once again launch a month-long special rectification of online micro-short dramas. This series of rectifications has exposed a secret but flourishing cultural industry to public view: in 2021, the number of micro-short dramas registered throughout the year was 398, and in 2022 the number was close to 2,800, an increase of 600%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Special rectification has pressed the pause button on the chaotic and barbaric situation, but the entire industry is still in the stage of rapid development of &quot;go big and go fast&quot;. While producers are adjusting scripts and standardizing content, some big directors, big actors and big companies are also actively participating in the short drama industry, and the pace of entering overseas sinking markets is also advancing rapidly. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Shady maids&quot; are not allowed&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In fact, the competent authorities have carried out multiple rounds of rectification. According to media reports, starting from late November 2022, the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television will use a concentrated period of three months to organize and carry out special rectification work on online micro-short dramas. As of February 28, 2023, a total of pornographic, vulgar, bloody, violent, and low-style dramas have been offline. There are more than 25,300 micro-short dramas with content such as aesthetics, vulgarity, etc., &quot;forming a deterrent effect and effectively curbing the barbaric growth of online micro-short dramas.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, the short drama industry has ushered in another wave of rectification. On November 16, Douyin announced that it had recently removed 119 illegal micro-short dramas in its mini-programs, and dealt with 1,188 Douyin accounts that illegally promoted micro-short dramas. On November 18, WeChat had removed illegal micro-short dramas from its mini-programs. There were 114 short plays, and 163 mini-program accounts were dealt with for publishing micro-short plays in serious violation of regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Those themes that are more sensitive are definitely subject to great restrictions, such as time travel and extreme revenge.&quot; Lu Liwen&#39;s company is located in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, and she has also stepped into this trend and started making short plays. She is a screenwriter. , because the company&#39;s business has developed too fast, the transformation is responsible for &quot;receiving the script&quot;. The country has introduced new policies that have a direct impact on its business. For example, she said that popular &quot;story synopses&quot; such as &quot;The Dark Maid&quot; will no longer be allowed. &quot;Adjustments should be made according to the requirements of radio and television. It is not so easy to publish a story that is too old.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She told Southern Weekend reporters that the short dramas on the market are basically the same and not particularly eye-catching. A story that shines before your eyes, &quot;bound in a system.&quot; The themes of short plays mainly focus on several categories such as boss, romance, and son-in-law. Lu Liwen said that due to market and increasingly strict regulatory considerations, people generally do not dare to make new attempts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a result, the short drama market, which is already highly homogeneous, has become more crowded with themes. In order to avoid this problem, they will cast a wide net and select the best among the same types of themes. &quot; If we can accept 100 books, we will basically sign about 10 with the same theme, and then we will not accept any more.&quot; Lu Liwen said that if the project is major, she will also go with the team to modify the lines according to the scene. Temporary changes to the play to make it more realistic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;(The rectification) mainly targets vulgar content such as bloody violence and pornography.&quot; Mr. Huang is a producer of a film and television company in Zhejiang. He is known as &quot;Brother Hua&quot; in the circle. He is stationed in Hengdian all year round to film with the team. . He recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that the rise of short dramas has a certain relationship with the epidemic. The impact of the epidemic on the traditional film and television industry is well known, and the past few years have been a period of rapid development of short video platforms, and the short drama genre was born. During this period, there was no clear requirement for registration when shooting vertical screen short dramas, so all kinds of dramas with exaggerated and uninformed plots became chaotic and expanded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He called the short drama market during this period the first stage of barbaric growth. &quot;I&#39;m telling you now clearly what can and cannot be photographed.&quot; Hua Ge said that in fact, national supervision has never been interrupted, and his company&#39;s business lines have also been adjusted. In his view, short plays, like movies, TV series, and &quot;online movies&quot;, are a cultural product designed to meet the spiritual needs of the audience. The introduction of policies to standardize development will help improve the production level and &quot;clear out those Low quality stuff”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the barbaric growth in the barbaric period will reach its final climax in November 2023. On November 16, the paid mini-series &quot;Black Lotus&#39;s Advancement Manual&quot; was launched. According to media reports, the paid amount reached 20 million yuan within 24 hours of its launch, and its ability to attract money is staggering. This micro-short drama with the theme of revenge of a concubine has a fast pace and many twists and turns. It is regarded as a combination of &quot;The Legend of Zhen Huan&quot; and &quot;Story of Yanxi Palace&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, less than a week after its launch, the show was removed from the shelves by multiple platforms for &quot;exaggerating the bad values ​​of extreme revenge and using violence to counter violence&quot; and &quot;confused the concepts of right and wrong.&quot; Around this time, a new round of special rectification was unveiled, and the short drama market bid farewell to its first stage of rapid growth, which was barbaric and disorderly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The filming scene of a short play in Hengdian.

Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Zhao Ming&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;You can kneel when you get married, but not housekeepers&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The SARFT’s rectification work on online micro-short dramas involves seven aspects, including accelerating the formulation of &quot;Internet micro-short dramas&quot; &quot;Short Drama Creation, Production and Content Review Rules&quot;, and micro-short dramas containing pornographic and vulgar content, bloody violence, low style, vulgar aesthetics, etc. will be offline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Squatting in the WeChat group all day long, Deng Zhuye constantly asked for advice from his predecessors to understand the spirit of the document, &quot;For example, the notice said not to kneel down at all times, which is promoting feudal ideology.&quot; So, what kind of kneeling is reasonable? A novice screenwriter raised this question in the group. A mature screenwriter who has been in the industry for two or three years analyzed that paying homage to the dead and ancestors, as well as the marriage plot of costume dramas, are all legitimate needs for kneeling. &quot;However, in the Ba Zong drama, the eldest young master asked the housekeeper to kneel down, which is obviously not allowed.&quot; Deng Zhuye explained that the policy is not one-size-fits-all and needs to be reasonably arranged according to the plot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rectification work mainly focuses on the content. If you understand the spirit of the policy, it is not difficult to comply with the regulations. &quot;I stayed up all night and kept revising the script.&quot; After repeated self-examination and self-correction, Deng Zhuye deleted all the money involved in his script or changed it to imaginary numbers to eliminate the possibility of &quot;showing off wealth.&quot; She said that the producer is currently only requesting changes to the draft, and has not rejected the draft or reduced the supply due to reduced demand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deng Zhuye is a fan of Yu Hua and Mo Yan. At the same time, she maintains the habit of reading Western classics. She often reads &quot;La Traviata&quot; and &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;. She loves literature and writing. I hope to write my own serious literature in the future. But now, she had to follow the production company&#39;s revisions and push herself to move forward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a period of observation, in the view of 24-year-old &quot;Hengdiao&quot; actor Xing Jialin, the industry rectification is &quot;good news&quot; for herself, &quot;at least the requirements for &#39;bordering&#39; are much less.&quot; The so-called borderline refers to a kind of soft pornography, which is a vague area between platform bans and non-bans. In order to attract people&#39;s attention, some directors will set up some nudity scenes. Relatively speaking, the salary of side actors will be much higher than that of regular actors. &quot;If you don&#39;t do side work, it will be 300 yuan a day. If you do side work, it will be 700 to 800 yuan a day.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The crew once gave Xing Jialin a low-cut sling to play a female prisoner. Sometimes, intimate scenes will be added temporarily. She believed that these scenes were just for the sake of edging and had nothing to do with the needs of the plot, so she instinctively resisted. &quot;Actually, the scale of the scene is not too big, and the intimate scenes are also performed in different places, but I just feel disgusted.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xing Jialin has a background in acting, so she will figure out how to improve her acting skills. However, when it comes to short play sets, it’s often a one-step process, and there’s no time for the actors to memorize their lines. “Just give a rough idea on the spot.” &quot;Micro-expressions and movement details are all cut off.&quot; She said that in one scene, she needs to push the heroine into the water with another character. The normal operation should be that the two people would make eye contact to show their insidiousness and intentions. Ghost fetus, on the set of the short play, these are not needed at all, the director asked to push it directly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xing Jialin receives an average of six or seven short plays every month, and the filming is often completed before she even remembers the title of the play. The busiest time was from 9 a.m. to 6 a.m. the next day. In order to keep up with the schedule, the director asked her not to take off her makeup, so she wore her makeup for three days in the stuffy studio, &quot;shooting right after waking up.&quot; Xing Jialin had previously mainly participated in horizontal-screen film and television dramas, and had roles with lines in two major productions. However, because of her starring role in &quot;Collapse of the House&quot;, both of them could not be broadcast later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The industry rectification has not stopped the operation of this assembly line. However, Xing Jialin no longer has to worry about whether to wear suspenders or not, and has doubts about her acting career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On December 1, 2023, extras rested on the set of the short drama crew.

Photographed by Southern Weekend reporter Zhao Ming&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Foreigners are also very popular”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the past half month, the number of manufacturers who have come to inquire about the overseas business of short dramas has suddenly increased. Zhu Haicong realized that the short drama market has reached a new node. &quot;In the past, it was mainly the leading companies that were producing (overseas short plays), but now some small and medium-sized manufacturers are also interested.&quot; He is the manager of a company in Shenzhen that specializes in producing overseas short plays. His experience in just over half a year has made him He couldn&#39;t help feeling that the short drama market was really changing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The export of short plays overseas has become a trend, and industry regulation is intensifying the development of this trend. &quot;The rectification is the direct reason, mainly because the domestic production volume is too high.&quot; Zhu Haicong told Southern Weekend reporters that their company originally mainly undertook the promotion business of domestic brands in overseas markets, and had many shooting resources in Europe and the United States. About half a year ago, companies began to come to me, wanting to film short dramas adapted from online articles. After some market research, their company determined that this was indeed an outlet, and they naturally expanded their business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Local shooting, a local crew was assembled, and after filming was completed, the crew was disbanded on the spot. Because of years of resource accumulation, Zhu Haicong&#39;s company quickly solved the problem of the shooting team. The core problem was the cultural differences between East and West. &quot;Essentially, short plays are a kind of cultural export, and foreign directors were not very understanding at first.&quot; He recalled that the first short play undertaken by the company told the story of a takeaway boy&#39;s counterattack: The boy discovered that a girl A friend had an affair with a rich second-generation man and was humiliated by him. However, he quickly counterattacked and slapped the &quot;bad couple&quot; in the face. But for such a simple plot, the director couldn&#39;t convey the emotions fully. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It’s not because the director has no skills, it’s probably because his skills are too high.” He explained that in order to get the feeling of satisfaction after the counterattack, he needed to give many close-ups of the actor’s eyes and expressions when he was being humiliated. , but the foreign director used a lot of medium shots and long shots. &quot;If the camera is not moved properly, the violent conflict cannot be expressed.&quot; Zhu Haicong had to change directors and cinematographers to achieve the effect he was satisfied with. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there are still strong emotional similarities between Eastern and Western audiences. &quot;Some localization will be done, but the core is the same.&quot; Zhu Haicong said that the Chinese can understand the setting of the delivery boy at a glance, but in North America and Europe, there are not many full-time delivery boys. In comparison, In other words, the story shell of werewolves and vampires is naturally easy for foreigners to understand. However, no matter which type of setting, the core of the story is the boss, revenge, and &quot;foreigners are also very good&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It&#39;s very strange and outrageous, but it&#39;s also very exciting. I want to know how the story will develop next.&quot; Zhu Haicong said that currently short dramas from China have occupied a place in the Western cultural consumer market. However, the manufacturers that have achieved success are all major companies that have been exporting online content overseas for many years, because the cost of filming short dramas overseas is much higher than in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He introduced that in China, two to three hundred thousand yuan can be used to shoot a 100-episode short drama, but in the North American market, the cost of manpower, material resources and venue rental are much higher than in China. The cost of a short play is converted into RMB, which is at least 1 million yuan. This figure is the cost line after the number of filming reaches at least seven or eight, and the cost line is evenly divided, plus operations and promotion, it is at least 10 million yuan or more. Only with the project size can we consider going overseas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He noticed that more and more short drama manufacturers are waiting to see and participate in going overseas. &quot;This shows that domestic short drama manufacturers are actually developing very fast.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;A short drama filming site in Hengdian.

Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Zhao Ming&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Big capital has entered the market&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Xia Xia (pseudonym) is a screenwriter who has switched from traditional drama series to short dramas. After several content adjustments, She is keenly aware that centralized rectification may be an opportunity for the industry to transition to high-quality products. She explained to the reporter from the southern weekend that there will be counterattack plots in traditional episodes, but they need to be paved before and after the counterattack. The plot has the main line and a sub -line. To realize the reversal within time, this routine is the &quot;essence&quot; of short dramas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the short drama era, the audience&#39;s emotions need to be &quot;instant satisfaction&quot;. &quot;It is emotional PPT. The upper and lower PPTs are not very coherent, and they are all OK.&quot; Xia Xia said that the audience did not want to see the protagonist&#39;s grievances and insulted. If the heroine was slapped, the heroine and husband must immediately slap immediately. Go back, &quot;There is no logic, keep reversing, just keep playing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;You slap me, I slap you, no one likes to write this kind of script all the time?&quot; She said, after the industry specifications, those particularly exaggerated, completely brainless, logical and separated from away from separation The actual drama will be restricted. If there is a large capital to enter the game, attract better talents to enter the industry, the quality of the short drama may also rise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In fact, the booming of the short drama market is attracting more and more talents. According to media reports, the old artists and old actors of TVB have joined the shooting of micro -short drama; the head Internet platform has also ended, shooting short dramas to seize the market. &quot;Good actors will definitely improve their quality.&quot; Hua Ge said that the addition of head platforms will have a profound impact on the development of the short drama market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He introduced that the main profit model of the current short drama is concentrated in the paid viewing stage. In order to get exposure, the producer should &quot;develop&quot; on the platform to obtain traffic. Large cost. The addition of large companies and large platforms will bring new account division models and IP incubation models. Even some brands are directly contacting the short drama producer, and the brand implanted short dramas are booming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At the same time, the capital side has increasingly joined this feast. &quot;We are also actively approaching private equity institutions.&quot; Hua Ge said that the company will promote the shooting of many short dramas at the same time. He has just killed 4 at hand. Hengdian is a prosperous scene because of the rise of the short drama market. Because the actor&#39;s schedule is tight, there are many dramas in the venue, and the crew often stays up late. Therefore, the company intends to invest in the construction of two shooting sheds, and this heavy asset requires a lot of capital investment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Hua Ge and the crew are stationed in Hengdian all year round. He introduced that after the script and actor are in place, a short drama can be completed in a week. Earlier, the cost of more than 100,000 yuan could be produced in a episode, which was about 2.3 million yuan later. Now, the cost of production has reached one million yuan, and the two million yuan episodes have also appeared in large quantities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 04 Dec 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[上海独生女继承两亿遗产被诉离婚？婚姻不应成为财富再分配的工具丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261768]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-12-03 19:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; November 30, 2023, the &quot;Shanghai Rule of Law&quot; publication The article is called: the woman&#39;s family is good and serves as the head of a foreign company; the man is the docking staff of the hotel where the women&#39;s company&#39;s annual meeting. The man fiercely pursued the woman, and later they married. After marriage, the woman&#39;s parents died of a car accident during the journey. Half a year later, the man sued the divorce and asked the woman to inherit the heritage of her parents. The woman&#39;s parents have nine real estate and shops in Shanghai, and more than 10 million yuan of bank deposits and wealth management products, with a total value of about 200 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; This article once rushed to the hot search first, a main label of more than 600 million clicks, the popular comment includes &quot;I even suspect that car accident ...&quot; &quot;&quot; You can take out 10 million to handle it to ensure that the man is less than a dime &quot;, and the man is accused of&quot; eating the household &quot;. In short, the man scolds the man shameless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; This is actually the story of the lawyer Tan Fang, neither gives a specific timeline nor showing credible evidence, including referee documents. Some netizens found that when she was sharing this story in 2022, she had a label with &quot;content containing fictional creation&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; For this reason, some media interviewed Ma Lei, a partner of Tan Fang&#39;s law firm. , Fictional names such as names. However, it is common to use the name in news reports. The reporter is labeled in the article or at the end of the article. It will not recognize &quot;fictional creation&quot; because of the use of a pseudonym. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; In summary, the authenticity of the case is suspicious and needs to be further confirmed. However, the emotion and response caused by this story is true and strong: from a large number of online comments, it can be seen that the heritage of the public generally does not recognize and unacceptable the legacy of the men&#39;s parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; And, there are indeed such cases in judicial practice. In March of this year, Guangxi High Court released a case of property disputes. In 2021, Zhang agreed to divorce with his wife Wang, and his daughter lived with Wang. On the grounds that Zhang did not pay his daughter&#39;s support fee, Wang filed a lawsuit after the divorce property dispute after divorce. During the trial, Wang learned that Zhang&#39;s mother died during the calm period of divorce, and left a set of real estate. Zhang sold the above houses. Wang asked Wang to divide Zhang&#39;s selling houses to sell the house. In the end, the court ruled that Zhang Mou paid more than 2.18 million yuan in house sales. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; During the duration of the relationship between the husband and wife, one party requires to divide the parent legacy inherited by the other party. The current Civil Code Marriage and Family Editor stipulates that &quot;inheritance or gifts&quot; is the common property of the husband and wife, and the husband and wife are owned by the husband and wife (Article 1062). This is the principle of default; When the property was &quot;&quot;, it was the personal property of the husband and wife (Article 1063). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; This provision in the text is to expand the scope of the common property of the husband and wife, so that the economic disadvantaged party can be divided by the weak side of the divorce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; The question is that when marriage becomes a tool for wealth re-distribution, marriage and wealth are not safe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; As far as marriage is concerned, under the scope of the scope of the common property of the husband and wife, if the two people who have different property and income are married, the marriage will become It is even more unstable, because this helps the routine of &quot;marriage is entrepreneurship, divorce is rich&quot;. Before the marriage of the real estate (= half of the real estate), it is good to leave the heritage of one parent without a will. One party does not necessarily have substantial control and dominance, but as long as divorce, the other party can substantially obtain the control and dominance of half of the property. Through a divorce, a large amount of wealth is achieved, and financial freedom is achieved, which will inevitably stimulate the evil of human nature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; In terms of wealth, a set of real estate in first-tier cities often tens of millions, and it is often accumulated at least two generations of wealth. It is very unfair to lose half a set of real estate, making people holding real estate in large cities very insecure. Therefore, before more and more people enter the marriage, they are required to be a household, or just hold a wedding without receiving a certificate to prevent themselves &quot;exploded&quot; when they divorce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; Back to the inheritance problem, parents want to leave the property to their children or other descendants of blood after a hundred years. It is in line with the law of nature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; The heritage left by the parents to the children, without a will and applicable to the legal inheritance, according to the natural law and customary method, the children inherited from of course, the children should be the children. Personal property. However, as mentioned above, the current text and judicial practice specifies its deficiencies as the common property of husband and wife. One parent died suddenly without a will. The greed or stimulated by the other party could be divided into half of the legacy of the other parents through divorce to achieve financial freedom and reached the peak of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; Of course, many people believe that there is love, and that the economy is not necessarily ethical, but don&#39;t test human nature In this step, it is enough to destroy the trust in marriage and let everyone feel fear of marriage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; Old people who have knowledge, culture, and understanding of the law know what to do. There are media reports: Recently, the 85-year-old &lt;x cite = &quot;Mailto: hu&quot; dates = &quot;2023-12-02t18: 23&quot;>; Grandma Liu came to China will, to give her own property to her own property The granddaughter, the son -in -law and daughter -in -law knows and agree. She said that her life was very happy in her later years, and she was a model coach without taboos. Roughly this consideration: Leave it to his son directly, and the daughter -in -law may be unhappy, and he will complain that &quot;you don&#39;t trust me&quot;; if you cross the son, leave it directly to the granddaughter, and solve this problem perfectly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; &quot;White Paper White Paper (2022)&quot; of the Chinese will: 99.8%of the old man stands for the inheritance of the inheritance of the inheritance of the inheritance of the children, and does not belong to the co-owned property of the husband and wife. It is the so -called &quot;anti -daughter -in -law and son -in -law&quot; clause. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; In the final analysis, they are forced by the current grammar and judicial practice. The elderly have worked hard to accumulate the real estate in their lives, so that the &quot;outsiders&quot; who have no blood relationship and may divorce at any time take away half a house, and most of the elderly are psychologically unacceptable. However, more elderly people have no consciousness in this regard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 23:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[我的父亲母亲丨逝者]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261744]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-12-03 23:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/29/tzfscurkubprwt7GKPHYGBOT44F4JGLOALCSSM4M.jpg &quot;Border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 960 &quot;height =&quot; 640 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm/medias/ima/ima GE/23/11/29/TZFSCURKUBPRWT7GKPHYGBOT44F4JGLOALCSSM4M. jpg &quot;data-key =&quot; 260020 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999; text-align: center; &quot;>; Ma Guoguang (1928-2014) Zhejiang, judge Zheng Ruyu (1930-2022) Zhejiang, Zhejiang, Teacher &lt;span style = &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The key bag of the bulging drums suddenly became lighter, and the parents&#39; house completed the sale and delivery.

In the 1960s, material scarcity, but as long as she was at home, every meal in our family was modeling, there was a sale, and even the dish was not ambiguous. It will definitely wipe it clean. Every year on the first year of the year, the family was full of meat and fragrance in the house ... The mother&#39;s red cheeks were full of satisfaction and enjoyed a rare rest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After we became a family, when we went every weekend, she happily took out the boxes and bottles of large and small dishes and soups, and posted the &quot;food guide&quot; written in a medicinal box paper. She said, &quot;I burn it once, and you can eat it once.&quot; In this way, she insisted stubborn until she was hospitalized last year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At work, the mother is also seriously desperate. After a day of housework, she often used her seat as a table, self -study, preparing work materials, and writing textbooks. She graduated from the nurse school and later served as a teacher, step by step to become the leader of the Shanghai Nursing Discipline. In the 1970s, her mother signed up to participate in the support of the Huaibei Medical Team. In order to run a few more points, sometimes she had to walk dozens of kilometers a day. At that time, she was 40 years old and eventually suffered pneumonia. Her mother has been working until the age of 70. She retires with the title of senior lecturer.

After investigation, the hospital had problems such as over-diagnosis and treatment, over-examination, over-prescription of medicines, repeated charges, fraudulent charges, and excessive charges, involving illegal medical expenses of 218,200 yuan, of which 187,000 yuan was illegally used of medical insurance funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For this reason, the &quot;Wuhu Municipal Medical Insurance Bureau processed in accordance with the agreement&quot;, recovered the medical insurance fund used in violation of regulations, and deducted a penalty of 56074.41 yuan according to the 30%top. Yuan report reward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On November 30th before that, the Economic Observation Network published a report &quot;Anhui family members found that the 310,000 medical expenses surveyed by the Three Hospitals Exchanges for Exceeding 210,000&quot;, and the social media also played a &quot;famous school. The doctor uses a statistical model to find the label of the hospital with 100,000 medical expenses &quot;. The report from the Anhui Medical Insurance Bureau confirmed this report. On December 3, the &quot;Economic Observation&quot; also published a self -description of the patient&#39;s son (doctor of law), telling how he found that the hospital was greasy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Specifically, family members find that when excluding surgery and do not need dialysis, patients need to pay 1,000 yuan per day per day; when hemodialysis/continuous blood purification requires . This model is suitable for two months before hospitalization, but since June 14, 2022, the amount of self -funding has skyrocketed, and then compared with the charging items, it is found that the hospital is suspected of fictional hemodialysis monitoring time, fictional patients receive exercise therapy, fictional intestinal nutritional nutrition Number of injection and skewers and drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On this basis, the doctor conducted a statistical analysis, which concluded that the hospital was at least deceived and the use of the medical insurance fund 95861.93 yuan-103681.93 yuan. The notification issued by the Anhui Provincial Medical Insurance Bureau showed that the actual amount was twice as much. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Observing this incident, the motivation of the patient&#39;s family&#39;s report is a very meaningful observation perspective, which has irreplaceable value to explore how to reduce the hospital&#39;s medical insurance fund. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Patients suffer from diabetes and nephropathy and uremia during their lifetime, and they need to be dialy -dialysis. On March 19, 2022, they were urgently sent to the above hospital due to unexpected left limbs and were diagnosed with hypothalery brain hemorrhage Breaking into the brain chamber, the doctor described himself: &quot;Dad was hospitalized in Wuhu Second Hospital for 117 days in total. After three craniotomy surgery, he has been treated in the hospital ICU. &quot;. This gives the hospital&#39;s space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The report does not stated whether the patient enjoyed whether the employee&#39;s medical insurance or residents&#39; medical insurance, but no matter what kind of medical insurance, the medical insurance fund paid the big head, the self -payment is a small head, the hospital&#39;s fictional medical projects, the income income medical expenses The main purpose is, of course, to pick up the medical insurance fund (1870,000 yuan in this case). However, the direct reason for being reported was obviously that the family members of the patients found that &quot;the amount of self -funding increased&quot; (312,000 yuan in this case) felt wrong. The patient&#39;s family&#39;s motivation for care of his own interests was the decisive factor that caused the report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In this sense, maintaining a certain self -payment ratio when using medical insurance is not related to the abundance of the medical insurance fund, and whether the medical insurance fund can be properly used. This arrangement provides a incentive and linkage mechanism for patients and their families. Everyone has a probability that they will care about their money and not be collected by the hospital. Instead, they will pay attention to whether the medical insurance fund has been abused by the hospital. In the final analysis, it is a human nature. The problem, good use of self -interest, also helps promote public interest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Secondly, both employees and residents&#39; medical insurance are essentially compulsory medical protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In terms of working medical insurance, employees pay a certain percentage of a certain percentage of wages before tax (generally 2%+units 8%). The accumulation of accounts is different. The medical insurance benefits (social coordination parts, manifested as the medical insurance fund) that everyone enjoyed is the same. In essence, it is three &quot;transfer payment&quot;: the generation of people, young people and the next generation to retirees, the elderly and the last generation of intergenerational payment; The patient&#39;s transfer payment to the weak and sick. Residents &#39;medical insurance pays premiums according to the age group, and then the government provides most of the subsidies. The reimbursement rate is slightly lower than that of employees&#39; medical insurance. The same is true for everyone to enjoy medical insurance treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; If the insured is hospitalized, most of the medical expenses are paid by the medical insurance fund. Although the medical insurance fund comes from everyone&#39;s payment, it has been mixed with a large pool. &quot;Eating in the mouth is your own&quot;, and it is manifested as a third -party payment in form. Inspire yourself with more and better inspections and treatment methods. This has formed a resonance with the interests of the hospital: who is paying for money is not important. The important thing is that someone pays money. As long as someone pays, how will the hospital resist themselves to make more money? Now the patient takes the initiative to ask for more and better examination and treatment methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Therefore, third -party paid itself will push up medical prices and medical expenses. The ultimate form is British -style public medical care. Patients do not pay at all, but because there is no price to reflect the strength of demand, everyone holds the mentality of not in vain. This has led to a longer and longer waiting time, and there are really major illnesses that need to be treated with urgent need to be treated with priority arrangements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the country, the Medical Insurance Bureau has launched various means of control, such as paying for single disease or DRGS (paid by group diagnostic diagnosis). In fact, many practices are studying abroad. Every year to the end of the year, it is difficult to be hospitalized in some places, because the hospital&#39;s medical insurance quota has been used up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; To some extent, the hospital&#39;s fictional medical projects and more medical expenses for patients are cats and mouse games played with the Medical Insurance Bureau: If you control the fee, I will counter control fee. &quot;It is your own.&quot; The hospital and the Medical Insurance Bureau are asymmetric. For medical problems, doctors are experts. Experts go up and down their hands. It is not easy for laymen to pierce. Just walking around the river, how can you not get wet feet, and when you meet the family members of more real and knowledgeable patients, you can take off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Frankly speaking, the control and anti -control fee are a coordinated game. The road is one foot height, one foot high, endless. As long as the mandatory medical insurance+third -party payment, it is difficult to have a solution once and for all. You can only see the tricks, constantly iterate, and continue to lay new patch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 23:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[永世难忘的师生际遇：回忆姜亮夫先生与“楚辞班”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261766]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-12-03 22:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;img img-id = &quot;73919&quot; group-id = &quot;0&quot; asset-id = &quot;70709&quot; src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/03/dabd733a49.jpg&quot; img- test = &quot;jiangliangfu2.jpg&quot; alt = &quot;&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot; 1080 &quot;height =&quot; 786 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/03/dabd733a49.jpg &quot;data- key =&quot; 260521 &quot;style =&quot; &quot;>; &lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;color: rgb (153, 153, 153); text-align: center;&quot;>; 1980 Chu Ci lecture class thirteen students took a group photo with Jiang Liang husband and wife.

However, at that time, college teachers faced severe &quot;green and yellow non -connected&quot; problems. Some young and middle -aged teachers&#39; business level also needs to be improved. After investigation, the Ministry of Education proposed to allow some old experts to bring young and middle -aged teachers, and entrusted relevant universities to organize training classes. This kind of advanced class highlights the business expertise of the old experts. For example, the training teacher&#39;s lecturer class organized by Mr. Hong Cheng, Nanjing University, and the opera lecture class organized by Mr. Wang Jisi, Sun Yat -sen University, was roughly between 1979 and 1980. Mr. Jiang Liangfu, the University of Hangzhou University, to hold the Chu Ci lecture class, and it was also during this period. &lt;br>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the autumn of 1979, Mr. Jiang is an old man who is 78 years old. But after receiving the task, he was still very happy. He &quot;felt that this was a very important academic research task&quot;, &quot;Maybe it was my biggest cultivation&quot;, so &quot;do not have a spiritual spirit, formulate plans, prepare for reference books, and formulate a teaching outline. Use full efforts to complete this task &quot;&lt;span style =&quot; font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, Simkai, Stkaiti; &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Before September 20, 1979, all 13 students arrived. They are: Lin Weichun &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, SIMKAI, stkaiti;&quot; (Jinan University) &lt;/span>;, Hao Zhida &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, Simkai, Stkaiti; &quot;>; (Nankai University) &lt;/span>;, Zhang Chongchen &lt;span style =&quot; font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, Simkai, Stkaiti; &quot;(Lanzhou University) &lt;/span>; STYLE = &quot;FonT-FAMILY: Kai, Kaiti_GB2312, Simkai, Stkaiti;&quot;>; (Northeast Normal University) &lt;/span>;, Wang Yanhai &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body_gb2312, simkai, stkaiti;&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot; >; (Liaoning University) &lt;/span>;, Yao Yixin (&lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, SIMKAI, stkaiti;&quot;>; East China Normal University) &lt;/span>;, Zhao Haoru &lt;span style = &quot;font- FAMILY: Kaita, Kai Type_GB2312, SIMKAI, Stkaiti; &quot;(Yunnan University) &lt;/span>;, Yin Guangye &lt;span style =&quot; font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, simkai, stkaiti; &quot;(Yunnan University) &lt; /span>;, Jiang Zonglun &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, SIMKAI, Stkaiti;&quot; (Kunming Teachers College) &lt;/span>;, Lu Peicheng &lt;span style = &quot;FONT-FAMILY: Kaiti, Kaiti_ GB2312, SIMKAI, Stkaiti; &quot;>; (Shaanxi Normal University) &lt;/span>;, Lihuang &lt;span style =&quot; font-family: Kai style, Kaiti_GB2312, Simkai, Stkaiti; &quot;(Qinghai Normal University) &lt;/span>; , Li Anhuai &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, SIMKAI, stkaiti;&quot; (Guizhou Normal University) &lt;/span>;, Niu Guoping &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, Simkai, Stkaiti; &quot;>; (Gansu Normal University) &lt;/span>;. Because Niu Guoping did not participate in 1980, the academic community said that we were Mr. Jiang&#39;s &quot;twelve disciples&quot;, and Mr. Jiang often said that we were a &quot;melon&quot; he was &quot;knotted&quot; in his later years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The opening ceremony was held on the afternoon of September 24, 1979. A deputy principal of Hangzhou University and Director Hu Zhongying and Deputy Director of the Chinese Department of Chinese Department attended. Mr. Jiang delivered a brief speech at the ceremony, clearly put forward &quot;to comprehensively study Chu Ci&quot;. It also pointed out that &quot;this study is not only the knowledge of social science, but also the knowledge of natural sciences.&quot; Take the &quot;Lan&quot; in Chu Ci as an example to persuade everyone to do comprehensive research. Taking the &quot;Geng Yin&quot; of the Dajiyi Day of Chu Kingdom as an example, the study of Chu Ci also needs to understand folklore. Although there are not many words, the words are simple, and the students are deeply inspired as soon as they come up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the teaching plan, Mr. Mr. talks twice a week. Once in the classroom, some young teachers in Hangzhou University also came to listen to it; once, we could sit around at the Mr.&#39;s house. We can also talk about it, and the atmosphere is more active. In addition, every time you class, some auxiliary lectures will be issued, mainly about Mr.&#39;s related articles. As for individual counseling, it can be carried out at any time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Mr. also specifically specifies us to read and choose. During the must -have, Hong Xingzu&#39;s &quot;Chu Ci Make Notes&quot; is read by everyone; the remaining five types, namely Jiang Ji&#39;s &quot;Mountain Belt Pavilion&quot;, Wang Fu&#39;s &quot;Chu Ci Tong Interpretation&quot;, Dai Zhen&#39;s &quot;Qu Yuan&#39;s Note &quot;, Liu Mengpeng&#39;s&quot; Qu Zizhang sentence &quot;, Jiang Liangfu&#39;s&quot; Qu Yuan Fu &quot;, and then read two to three of them. There are fifteen types of reading, namely Zhu Xi&#39;s &quot;Chu Ci Ji Note&quot;, Lin Yunming&#39;s &quot;Chu Ci Lantern&quot;, Hu Wenying&#39;s &quot;Qu Sao Finger&quot;, Ding Yan&#39;s &quot;Chu Ci Tian Wen Ji&quot;, &quot;Bamboo Book Jury&quot;, &quot;Historical Records of the Chu Shijia &quot;Mandarin · Chu Language&quot;, &quot;Warring States Policy · Chu Ce&quot;, Engels&#39;s &quot;Family, Private ownership, and the Origin of the State&quot;, Ai Siqi &quot;Chinese Social History&quot;, Deng Yongling&#39;s &quot;Chinese Folklore&quot;, Wang Guowei &quot;Guantang Jilin&quot; , Himaqiyu&#39;s &quot;Qu Fuwei&quot;, Jiang Liangfu&#39;s &quot;Chu Dictionary Five&quot;, and Zhou Shengkai&#39;s &quot;Chu Bao&quot;, can choose several species again. After reading each book, you can write a reading report. The reading report I wrote was &quot;A Note&quot; A Note &quot;Chu Ci&quot; -Reading Liu Mengpeng&#39;s &quot;Qu Zizhang and Sentences&quot; &quot;, and Mr. Jiang was promised. This article was later published in the &quot;Literature&quot; magazine (series 12). I heard that Jiang Linchang said that when Mr. Jiang later guided doctoral students to write a reading report, he also used this article as a model. This is of course later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The lectures began to be very smooth. Although Mr. Jiang did not bring a lecture, the quotation of the literature was different from the different opinions of each family. In his clear thinking and smooth language, he revealed the esoteric problems of esoteric academic issues in a simple way. This kind of kind and natural teaching style has benefited the speakers endlessly. As we encountered Gan Lin for a long time, we were reluctant to let go, and concentratedly listened to every sentence of Mr.. And before the get out of class, Mr. always asked us if we understood it. When we said it, the gentleman stood up with a smile, and the two students helped him home. Later, we felt that Mr. was also tired of walking back and forth like this. He negotiated with the school. After that, every class (usually Thursday), the school sent a car to pick up and dropped it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img img-id = &quot;73921&quot; group-id = &quot;0&quot; asset-id = &quot;70711&quot; src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /12/03/acba5617dc.jpg &quot;img-compi =&quot; WeChat Picture_20230715215113.jpg &quot;alt =&quot; &quot;width =&quot; 1080 &quot;height =&quot; 1657 &quot;style =&quot; &quot;border =&quot; 0 &quot;data-src =&quot;// /images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/03/acba5617dc.jpg &quot;data- key =&quot; 260522 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style: #9999999; text-align: center &quot;>; Mr. Jiang Liangfu Read the picture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But in the seventh week, unexpected things happened. On the night of October 27, 1979, a little hair thief entered the room from Mr. Jiang&#39;s house. First, I stabbed the master &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, Simkai, Stkaiti;&quot;>; Pushing the ground, causing cerebral vibration and fracture of the tail vertebrae. The next day, the second old man was taken to the hospital for treatment. At this point, the school had to decide that the Chu Ci class was suspended. We have to take turns to duty to accompany the husband, but the gentleman is determined to say that our task is to learn, not to accompany patients. So we had to return to the original unit and wait for the notice of the re -class. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In late March 1980, I finally received a notice from Hangzhou University, requiring reports to be reported on April 5th, and started on April 7. I arrived at Hangzhou University on April 5th and went to visit Mr. Wang Yanhai on the same day. The husband&#39;s body recovered well, and he was very happy to see us, and said, &quot;You return to Hangzhou, it is not easy, I am very happy!&quot; It turned out that the university was evaluating the title, paying salary, and adjusting the house; you People are not in the school &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, SIMKAI, stkaiti;&quot;>; (even if you go out for further studies) &lt;/span>;, these are all end. And in order to learn with Mr. Jiang, we ignored it completely. No wonder Mr. was emotional. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In order to improve our knowledge structure and increase our opinion, by Mr. Hangzhou, Hangzhou University also arranged for a half -month visit to us. For this reason, Mr. wrote us twelve introductions to us, introducing us to the twelve famous experts from famous teachers (also old friends) in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, namely Chen Zhongfan and Cheng Qianfan of Nanjing University, Wang Shanye of Yangzhou Normal University 、 、, Zhu Jihai of Suzhou, Zhu Dongrun, Jiang Tianshu, Guo Shaoyu, Chen Zizhan of Fudan University, Xu Zhenxuan and Dai Jiaxiang of East China Normal University, Gu Tinglong of the Shanghai Library. When I went to the introduction letter, my gentleman also warned me, &quot;You must seriously ask the experts to ask the experts. Regarding the specific situation of this visit, I have written the article &quot;Recalling a Visit of Forty Years ago&quot; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, SIMKAI, stkaiti;&quot;>; (2023 July 3rd &quot;Southern Weekend&quot;) &lt;/span>;, it is not detailed here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After returning from the school, continue to class on May 8th, or twice a week, once in the classroom, once in the house of the husband. The distribution of lectures and individual counseling are carried out as usual. From May 8th to June 29th, Mr. Mr. gave six other classes, plus six lectures in the second half of 1979, with a total of twelve lectures. We have recording these lessons every time, and after class, division of labor and work. After the annotation of Kunwu, Mr. Jiang reviewed it and became the book &quot;Chu Ci Jin Yi Shi&quot;. After the Beijing Press was officially published in 1981, the book was immediately caused by the Chu Ci academic circles, and the title of Jiang Liangfu&#39;s &quot;Twelve Disciples&quot; was also called in the academic community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img img-id = &quot;73922&quot; group-id = &quot;0&quot; asset-id = &quot;70712&quot; src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /12/03/ff1b130855.jpg &quot;Img-Title =&quot; 01017A5772Bfe4e49e_b.jpg &quot;Alt =&quot; &quot;width =&quot; 1080 &quot;heart =&quot; 1566 &quot;style =&quot; &quot;border =&quot; 0 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images Then, then infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/03/ff1b130855.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260523&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>; Mr. Jiang Liangfu was recording in the classroom of the Chu Ci Passing Class, and later sorted out the book &quot;Chu Ci Jinyi Remarks&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In addition to learning Chu Ci, Mr. Jiang also made up the lesson to our ancient Chinese, especially text and phonology. There are also five or six times such a large class. Mr. The profound and unknown sound and rhyme knowledge &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, simkai, stkaiti;&quot;>; (such as &quot;waiting for call&quot;, etc.) &lt;/span>; Make us Maosen. Mr. also introduced us the most exquisite Mr. Tai Yan&#39;s &quot;Cheng Jun Tu&quot;, and said that &quot;Mr. Zhang Taiyan&#39;s&quot; Cheng Jun Tu &quot;is scientific, it tells us how to master the law of transfer&quot; &lt;span style = &quot;font -Family: Kai, Kaiti_GB2312, SIMKAI, Stkaiti; &quot;>; (see the&quot; Chinese Dictionary &quot;Zhejiang Province Writing Office&quot; Chinese Sanda theory &quot;) &lt;/span>;. Thirty years later, the pronunciation of the 28 words of &quot;Cangjie Book&quot; was due to Mr. Tai Yan&#39;s &quot;Cheng Jun Tu&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In short, during the study of Chu Ci class, in the current popular words, it is full. The most important thing is that Mr. taught us an advanced and effective academic method. Specifically, the following three points are included: &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first is a comprehensive research method, that is, multi -angle and multi -level research methods. &quot;Chu Ci&quot; is an encyclopedia, which has both rich historical materials of Chu culture, but also contains many important information about Asia and even Pacific culture. Therefore, the research on &quot;Chu Ci&quot; should not only stay at the level of literature, but should start in all directions. In this regard, Mr. Chu Ci Tong has made a glorious example for us. Since then, I have followed the analysis of &quot;Lan&quot; in Chu Ci &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, SIMKAI, stkaiti;&quot;>; Including five categories of Peran, Zelan, Mulan, Malan, orchid) &lt;/span>;, and the exploration of the meaning of Chu Sao Yong&#39;s &quot;orchid&quot; culture (that is, the soil of Chu Di, the good medicine of the fitness, the vanilla of the king, the poem of the king, the poem, the poem Si Zhiyuan) was inspired by his husband and walked along the road of his husband. My book of &quot;Chu Ci Culture Research&quot;, from the perspective of philosophy, politics, education, aesthetics, literature, history, geography, folklore, dialect, and even botany, the study of &quot;Chu Ci&quot; is actually a comprehensive comprehensive to Mr. Jiang A practice of research method. After reading, Mr. Cui Fuzhang said, &quot;There is the wind of the old master&quot;, which is not only an encouragement to me, but also shows that he saw my inheritance of Mr. Jiang&#39;s comprehensive research method. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The second is the &quot;triple evidence method&quot;. Since Mr. Wang Jing&#39;an proposed the &quot;Dual Evidence Law&quot; of &quot;Materials on the Underground&quot; with &quot;Materials on Correction Paper&quot; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, simkai, stkaiti;&quot; (see Its &quot;New Certificate of Ancient History&quot;) &lt;/span>;, the academic circles are praised. Mr. Jiang added one &quot;folklore&quot; on this basis. Not only did he often emphasize the importance of studying Chu Ci from the perspective of folklore, but he also specifically specified several reference books in folk customs, but also quoted a large amount of folk information in the &quot;Nine Songs&quot; research.例如他在讲《国殇》时，便引后世戏曲习俗中的“打加官”来说明该诗是“用来鼓舞战士的”。民俗是民间流传的活史料，虽未形成文献，但其中往往保存有古代人民生活的影子。先生虽未明确将他所注重的民俗与“二重证据”并列，但我们在私下里实已合“民俗”与“二重证据”为“三重证据法”了。我后来写作《楚人卜俗考》及《说“姱女”》等几篇文章，便着意运用了这一方法。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;三是比较记忆法。我因惊异于先生超常的记忆力，就问先生如何记得住那么多的楚辞文献。先生说靠比较记忆，即针对某一问题，比较各家之说的异同。这样文献就活起来了，而不再是刻板的教条。我尝试这样做了，果然收到了良好的效果。例如对《离骚》之“求女”及“两上昆仑”，我将自王逸以来，下迄唐人、宋人，明清各家，以至闻一多、游国恩、姜亮夫诸先生之说梳理一遍，明其异同，不但问题搞清了，连各种版本的要点也都记住了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;应该说，姜先生的这些治学方法不但可应用于楚辞，对其它古代文学作品也同样是适用的。我从中西交通的大背景以及宗教、民俗、新闻等角度对《聊斋志异》所作的综合研究，便充分证明了这一点&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（见拙著《聊斋丛考》）&lt;/span>;。我后来在治学和指导研究生时所倡导的“大文化视野下的古代文学研究”，也正是在姜先生“综合研究法”的基础上而提出的，并服膺终生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;楚辞班经历了前后两个阶段的学习，终于要结束了。 1980年6月28日上午，杭州大学举行了楚辞进修班结业典礼，校系领导、姜先生及全体学员都参加了。姜先生在典礼上发表了充满深情厚意的讲话。他说：“我因遭劫贼击伤住院，校方决定暂停授课，让学员返校听候复课通知。复课通知出去后，我们同学是否有兴趣再来？结果同学们都来了，甚至有的在校还有课，又在&#39;工调&#39;，涉及职称、工资、房子……什么都不顾，丢掉就来了……中断后又续上，续得毫无痕迹。可以向教育部反映，全国有没有这样的班？大家多少都看到了国家、民族的前途和利益，才来这里学习的。在杭大学习期间，用功是不用说的……我八十岁了，能结识你们这么多朋友，是世界上少有的事，我深感庆幸！”最后先生还鼓励学员们说：“你们继续走，我跟着你们走！”&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（姜先生的讲话系根据殷光熹兄的记录）&lt;/span>;既流露了先生一贯的谦虚与真诚，又充满了对学生的厚爱和热切的希望。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在结业典礼上，继姜先生的讲话后，我也情不自禁地作了一次发言，主要是讲从姜先生那里所受的教诲以及参加楚辞班的收获。我虽事先毫无准备，但从来都没有作过那样畅酣淋漓的发言。我讲话时，先生一直在颔首微笑。我知道，先生对我们这一班学员的刻苦学习、心无旁骛，是十分满意的。典礼结束，我送先生回家。在回去的路上，先生又告诉我说，我写的读刘梦鹏《屈子章句》的读书报告他已阅，写得好，主要的东西都抓住了，并让我再压缩一下，作为《中国大百科全书》的一个条目。先生啊先生，您对弟子的学业真是无时无刻不挂在心上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;结业典礼后，分别的日子就要来临了。正当我们几个班委&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（郝志达、林维纯、殷光熹、赵浩如、张崇琛）&lt;/span>;在商量如何答谢恩师时，姜先生却派他的女婿徐老师通知我们，说姜先生要在“楼外楼”饭馆宴请我们楚辞班全体学员。这真是令我们喜出望外。自古学生结业，只有学生请老师的，哪有老师请学生的？我想先生这一破例的做法，既体现了他对师生情谊的高度重视，同时也隐含着他对我们这一班学员的极好印象。宴会上我们频频举杯向先生致谢，并祝老师健康长寿。而姜先生也格外开心，一直慈祥地看着每一位学员。先生还再次语重心长地叮嘱我们回单位后，要努力学习和工作，今后学习上如有什么问题，还可以随时给他写信，继续进行切磋。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了能同先生在一起多待些时候，6月30日，我们又请先生到黄龙洞喝茶，先生也高兴地去了。先生一边喝茶，一边还在同我们谈学业。他要求我们回去后每人写一篇有关楚辞的文章，明年交来，由他出集子。他还告诉我们，各位的结业鉴定也已经写好，下午即可去取。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;下午，我如约来到先生家，将十二位学员的结业鉴定取回，先供大家传阅，然后再交杭大签注意见寄回原单位。可以看出，我们与先生相处的时间虽然不是很长，但先生对每个人的性情及治学特点都了如指掌，且皆勉励有加。其中关于我的一份是：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;张崇琛同志是个博涉群书的中年教师。这是一个最主要的读书方法。专门只搞一二门，自然容易为功，但成就必然有限。由博返约，然后能切实掌握所要掌握的东西，这即是近年来所盛传的综合研究方法的基本要素。他读书也非常细心老实，他最近所写的一篇《读刘梦鹏〈屈子章句〉》的读书报告，看来他所以能深切了解刘书的长处，同他博涉与细心两事分不开.是我们队伍中后起之秀。 &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;

(Photo provided by People’s Vision)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 18, 1968, China’s northernmost black land entered the best season of the year. A unit with the main task of “reclamation and border defense”-Heilongjiang Production Construction Corps - established. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In pursuit of the goal of &quot;reclaiming the Great Northern Wilderness&quot;, millions of urban educated youths rushed to a foreign land that was covered in frost all year round. In the vigorous tide of the times, young Fan Gang is no exception. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Fan Gang was born in 1953 in an intellectual family. His parents left Shanghai after graduating from church school and went to work in Beijing. There, after Fan Gang finished primary school, the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; began and he was assigned to attend a nearby middle school. But in just the past year and a half, the general environment has changed. In 1969, Fan Gang, who had just learned a few English letters, was assigned to work in the Heilongjiang Corps as an educated youth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Logging, clearing up wasteland, and farming, it took six years in a flash. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Despite being separated from the school environment, Fan Gang is still learning and thinking. Around 1974, the Heilongjiang Production and Construction Corps discussed trialling the work point system and reforming the original fixed wage system, and Fan Gang&#39;s company was selected as one of the pilots. Relying on the &quot;Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism&quot; and &quot;Political Economics Textbooks&quot; he had read, Fan Gang put forward his own opinions on the pilot plan and was invited to attend a meeting at the Corps headquarters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In 1975, Fan Gang was transferred to the countryside of Weichang County, Hebei Province, where his cousin lived, because he was visiting relatives and friends. There, there are only two meals a day in winter. After finishing millet porridge at 5 o&#39;clock in the afternoon, people are starving by seven or eight o&#39;clock. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;But soon, a turning point came. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Less than a year after leaving the village, Fan Gang was seconded to the county cultural center to engage in mass literary and artistic creation. In 1977, Fan Gang was experiencing life in the commune iron foundry when he heard the news on the radio about the resumption of the college entrance examination. Relying on the knowledge accumulated through years of reading miscellaneous books, he stood out from more than 5.7 million candidates across the country and was admitted to the Department of Economics of Hebei University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Four years later, Fan Gang was admitted to the Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, which had absolute authority in the field of economics at the time, and studied under Professor Zhu Shaowen, continuing to study his favorite field. Western Economics. There, Fan Gang&#39;s talent in economics was recognized again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In 1985, upon the recommendation of Dong Fucheng, then director of the Institute of Economics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Fan Gang was given the opportunity to study abroad, studying at the National Bureau of Economic Research and Harvard University in the United States. economics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;As important as talent is Fan Gang&#39;s diligence. Mentor Zhu Shaowen once mentioned that Fan Gang worked very hard when he was studying in the United States. He often couldn&#39;t get home because he left too late, so he slept under the table in the research bureau. In 1988, Fan Gang, who returned to China after completing his studies, successfully completed his doctoral thesis, and together with his fellow student Zuo Dapei, became the first two Western economics Ph.D.s independently trained in China after the reform and opening up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;After receiving his degree, Fan Gang continued to stay at the Institute of Economics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;His academic achievements and social influence extend far beyond the ivory tower. In the 1990s and early 21st century when China&#39;s reform and opening up set off huge waves, Fan Gang was a representative of young scholars in the economics community. At the age of 38, he won the Sun Yefang Economic Science Award, the highest award in domestic economics research; at the age of 39, he was promoted to the Academy of Social Sciences. Researcher; at the age of 40, he became one of the youngest doctoral supervisors in the Chinese social science community; in addition to academic work, he was twice appointed by the State Council as a member of the Central Bank&#39;s Monetary Policy Committee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;For his contributions and achievements in the field of transition economics, Fan Gang won the highest award in the domestic economic theory circle, the &quot;China Economic Theory Innovation Award.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;However, along with the honor and cheers, there are also doubts from the outside world. In 2018, during an interview with the media, Fan Gang was pushed into the limelight because of his view of &quot;emptying 6 wallets to buy a house.&quot; When asked about this view again two years later, Fan Gang responded that it was intended to express that houses were too expensive for young people to afford, rather than to encourage young people to &quot;gnaw at their old age.&quot; However, if he hadn&#39;t been asked again, he &quot;couldn&#39;t remember it&quot; himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;On November 2, 2023, Southern Weekend reporters met this 70-year-old scholar who is still energetic. Perhaps as a result of studying economics for many years, Fan Gang has a consistent determination, as if all the great changes of the times are just pebbles thrown into the lake to him, and all he wants is to &quot;hope that China will do well.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Only debate is exciting&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>; &lt;strong>;Southern Weekend&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>; When the college entrance examination was resumed in 1977, you were admitted to the Department of Economics of Hebei University. Why did you choose this major? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>;I went to the countryside in Heilongjiang Production and Construction Corps in 1969. The books I read at that time were all related to Marxism-Leninism, philosophy, political economics, and scientific socialism. After a lot of study, I found that I was more interested in political economics. &lt;br>;At that time, we also faced practical problems, which made people think. At that time, a company of the Construction Corps could still make a profit by farming with just 20 people. However, when more than 100 of us educated youths left, the cost increased and we actually lost money. It is said that labor creates value, how should we understand it now? At the same time, everyone is trying to change the status quo, which makes me more interested in economic issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In addition to reading theoretical books, I was also interested in literature. At that time, everyone wanted to be a literary and artistic young man, so I also worked hard on writing. Later, I also engaged in creation at the county cultural center and wrote some folk art programs. But literary creation relies on perceptual thinking. At that time, I thought that this aspect was not my real interest, because I was not good at telling stories and I was not motivated to tell them. What&#39;s the excitement, the theoretical debate, I get excited as soon as the debate starts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;The college entrance examination was resumed in 1977, and everyone could apply for three choices. I applied for economics in all of them, but not literature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;You once mentioned that you are still When you went to the countryside in Heilongjiang, you once made suggestions for the reform of the work-point system, but they were not adopted. Did this experience dampen your enthusiasm for economics? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>;I don’t feel frustrated or unhappy. At that time, the Corps headquarters was discussing whether to change fixed wages to a work-point system, and our company was selected as the pilot. Because I had learned a little bit about political economics, I wrote a paper with my ideas, and the company instructor handed it to me. Later, the Corps invited the two of us to attend a seminar at the Corps headquarters in Jiamusi. It could be said to be my first seminar on economic issues. It was a pleasure for me to participate in the discussion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;At that time, I was indeed very interested in theoretical research. Although I was not a professional and had no education, my interest was still very important. In the evening, everyone We all went to bed, and I was reading and writing alone under the oil lamp. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;When the college entrance examination was resumed in 1977, you Is the economics major you want to study highly competitive? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>; At that time, there were very few subjects and very few enrollments. For the political economics major, Peking University has one enrollment quota in Hebei Province, Jilin University has only one in Hebei, and the others are Hebei University. &lt;br>;Before I went to the countryside, I was only a primary school graduate and never went to middle school. When I knew that I was going to take the college entrance examination, I only had a little over two months of review time left. Fortunately, I never stopped reading in those years, and I could find all the books I could find. I read them all, so I relied on the &quot;foundation&quot; of reading miscellaneous books in literature, history and philosophy at that time, and I learned mathematics in those two months. There were a total of 8 textbooks in middle school. I studied a little more than 7, and finally scored more than 60 points in the test. Attended Hebei University. Now that I think about it, the whole review process was not easy, and I grasped the last straw. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>; You once mentioned that most of the university courses during your studies were classical economics. When did you first come into contact with modern economics? &lt;br>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>;I always say that we are a relatively lucky generation. When we first went to college in 1978, China’s economy was at its lowest point, with per capita income and economic growth rate very low. The Third Plenary Session of the First Central Committee was held, and the concept of reform gradually took shape. But in fact, what everyone was more familiar with at that time was the Soviet-style political economics. The modern economic theoretical system was not systematically taught in various universities. Only Professor Jiang Guangyuan, the department chair of Hebei University, did this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Professor Jiang graduated from Peking University with a master&#39;s degree in economics in the 1950s. He studied Western economics in his early years. During the ten years of turmoil, a group of them were decentralized and later transferred to support Hebei University. When I was a senior in college, when other schools were still teaching the &quot;school&quot; of Western economics, he gave us a textbook on the principles of modern economics in a systematic way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;It is also because this course allows us to master modern economics more systematically, so that we can realize that in those years when we were isolated from the world, modern economic theory It has become very complicated and needs to be remedied quickly. Only in this way can we talk to the world and know in which direction the theory should develop. So later I went to the Academy of Social Sciences for graduate school, and chose the history of Western economic thought as a major, and continued along this path. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Fan Gang&#39;s doctoral degree certificate.

In a certain sense, it can be said to be a bit stubborn, very persistent, Very stubborn. He sticks to his point of view, no matter what others say. After the reform and opening up, when everyone stopped talking about Marxist economic theory, Mr. Zhu still talked about it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Decades ago, he admired the views of List, the originator of German development economics. At that time, List believed that Germany was relatively backward and could not Economic measures adopted by developed countries must be adopted immediately, and there must be protection and certain government controls. Later, Japan learned from Germany, and Professor Zhu introduced these theories to China when he was studying at the University of Tokyo. But Professor Zhu&#39;s views were not recognized at that time, but now facts have proven that thanks to some unique industrial policies, our economy can develop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>; Development economics advocated by Professor Zhu The point of view has also been inherited by you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>; Some. To be honest, when the country was first opened, we paid more attention to the market economy itself. We were preoccupied with studying why other countries were so efficient and developed so advancedly, and we wanted to learn from Western systems to develop ourselves. At that time, before Western countries and we had reached the stage of competition, we were developing labor-intensive industries, and academic research was mainly concentrated in the field of institutional economics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;It was not until the new century that we began to have some development competition with developed countries that we began to think more about development economics. After 2010, I started teaching development economics to graduate students at Peking University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;Except for Professor Zhu, the past twenty During your years of study and research, are there any teachers whose teachings have had a greater impact on you? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>;This is a long story. One was Dong Fucheng, the then director of the institute. I once said in a commemorative article that I was able to study abroad because Director Dong gave me the only indicator. He felt that I had a foundation in foreign languages ​​​​and Western economics and could make good use of this opportunity, even though I was still young at the time. Not from the place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;The second person who had a great influence on me was Liu Guoguang, the then vice president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. He advocated reform. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, with his approval, we were able to set up a research group and write the book &quot;Outline of Macroeconomic Theory of Public Ownership&quot;. Although some of the views in this book were unclear at the time. Not entirely consistent with his views. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;There is also Professor Zhang Shuguang, who is now 84 years old. He is both my collaborator and my predecessor. He was the deputy chief author of the &quot;Outline of Macroeconomic Theory of Public Ownership&quot;. Compared to me, the main writer, he has personally experienced the era of planned economy and many early research experiences, and is more familiar with the reality of China. When writing the book, I had many in-depth exchanges with him, and the theoretical system of the book was also constructed by us together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;There are also some old gentlemen who, although I have not had much contact with them, left a deep impression on me, such as Wu Baosan. He returned from studying economics at Harvard and advocated using more scientific methods to analyze China&#39;s economic history. When he studied history, he not only saw the historical facts, but also saw the economic logic within it. In order to do research, he spent a lot of effort. Even during the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, he still wrote a lot of things in his study, which was not easy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;From today&#39;s perspective, they have been sitting on the bench for many years and have contributed to the basic project of Chinese economics. Don&#39;t forget them. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Consensus is &quot;balance&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;: &lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;During your PhD studies, you went to study in the United States and came up with the idea of ​​using modern economics theory to explain China’s problems. How could you come up with such an idea if you are not at the center of the reform trend? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>;After all, I had been studying economics for nearly ten years before going abroad, and at the same time, I was studying China&#39;s economic issues. In addition, after graduating from elementary school, I first stayed in the Heilongjiang Corps for six years, and then stayed in rural Hebei for two years. I had a real sense of poverty in rural areas, and also a real sense of China&#39;s economic problems. I have personally seen people in a state where they don’t have enough to eat. I still remember one time when I went to a house in the village. A middle-aged man was lying on the kang. I asked him why he didn&#39;t go to work. He said that there was some food for my son to eat at noon. If he went to the fields, I couldn&#39;t go there. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;After I went abroad and learned more things, I felt that I began to &quot;integrate&quot; theoretical and practical issues. The knowledge accumulated in the first 10 years of studying economics, Coupled with constant thinking about practical problems, I feel that I can better explain China&#39;s economic problems. I feel that I can do a lot of things, and these things are not what I can do abroad. I must do it with everyone at home. I did it, so I insisted on returning to China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>; Regarding the Chinese economic theory at that time, Do you have any clear ideas or plans for renovation? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>; There is no systematic plan, I just feel that there is a need for systematic understanding and change. For example, at that time, there was an endless debate in China about which was the truth, Marxist political economics or modern economics. When I was writing my doctoral thesis, I gradually realized that any theory is a process of continuous innovation and synthesis. Different theories The theories will gradually integrate and learn from each other&#39;s strengths, so I wrote my doctoral thesis &quot;Comparison and Synthesis of the Three Major Modern Economic Theoretical Systems&quot;. The purpose at that time was that no matter what others said, I figured it out myself. From now on, if I encounter this kind of problem again, I won’t be entangled or come back to it again and again. My point of view is in this book. I don’t have to discuss it over and over again, so I can be free to study real economic issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;So in the first ten years after I came back, I wrote several big books with millions of words, as well as some papers and essays. After finishing them, I felt It&#39;s easier. Not only do you no longer need to worry about some issues, but your theoretical views will also be more consistent, and you won&#39;t have to do this now, then that, and always have to revise and correct yourself later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;When I graduated with my Ph.D., the school had Are you saying that you are the first doctorate majoring in the history of Western economic thought? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>;Everyone may know that I am the first doctorate in this major, but in fact, Mr. Zhu led a total of I have obtained three master&#39;s degrees and two doctorates. I graduated with Zuo Dapei. You can say that I am the first, and you can also say that Zuo Dapei is the first. When we graduated, we didn’t have doctoral hats or gowns, so there was no sense of ceremony. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;During his doctoral studies, Professor Zhu did not You were allowed to participate in social discussions too early, so you only embarked on the path of &quot;managing the world for practical use&quot; after graduating from your Ph.D. What goals did you have at that time? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>;I got the associate senior professional title two years after I graduated with a Ph.D., and passed French and English in the third year. After passing the foreign language exam and publishing works on a certain scale, I was promoted to full professor under the exception, and all the professional title matters were completed around the age of 40. For me personally, I don’t want to be an official or do business. I really don’t have any specific goals. All I want to do is write something that can have an impact on others and contribute to the development of a discipline. However, I have also done some administrative work in recent years, including being responsible for two or three research institutions and fulfilling some social responsibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;In 2006, you became the central bank currency Member of the Policy Committee and served two terms thereafter. During this period, a series of problems such as the 2008 global economic crisis occurred one after another. Do you have any special observations during this tenure? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang&lt;/strong>;: It is very beneficial to participate in some discussions at this level. You can observe closely how various ministries and commissions consider issues. From different angles, we can enhance our understanding of the so-called interest subjects. Different ministries and commissions are responsible for different things. They not only represent the overall interests of the country, but also represent different interest groups and have different perspectives. During the discussion, the people sitting in the room, that is, representatives of various ministries and commissions, will bring their own issues and perspectives to the decision-making circle. Everyone will speak out and explain these issues clearly. The consensus reached in this way will be To a certain extent, it is what is called &quot;equilibrium&quot; in economics. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&quot;Goals should not be specific to things like position and money&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style= &quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>; Judging from the papers you published, you have many academic opinions that directly point to institutional issues. It seems that you are not a &quot;pacified&quot; scholar-official in the traditional Confucian concept. Image, is this a common trait among economists or is it just your personality? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>; There are also people who are more radical than me. One reason is that after the reform and opening up, there was a better environment, everyone spoke more openly, and the problems we faced at that time were more realistic and acute. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;But I don’t want to do anything to impress people. If I talk about a certain problem, the premise is that in my opinion, the problem really exists, and I I don’t want to turn a 3-point question into a 5-point or 10-point question. Although sometimes it may seem that what I say is harsh, the purpose is still to put forward some constructive ideas. The ultimate goal is to solve the problem. This is the bottom line that I have always adhered to. I hope China is good, and I hope China can continue to develop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;Analysis of China’s economy over the years Did you have any conflicts with others during the discussion? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>;There are always some differences in opinions, and there are even some deeper differences, but in most cases over the years, I have I don’t argue with others. I always feel that I just need to explain my point of view well. Whether others accept it or not is their business. You don’t have to think about convincing anyone. This will consume a lot of energy and is meaningless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;However, in early February this year, I published an article in &quot;Management World&quot; in which I put forward my different opinions on the comparative advantage point of view emphasized by Professor Lin Yifu. view. The so-called comparative advantage generally means that a backward country should make good use of its advantage of lower costs of certain production factors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;My basic point is that comparative advantage is only important in the early stages of our economic development, that is, before and after joining the WTO and before the wages of migrant workers skyrocketed. . When we enter the middle-income stage, comparative advantages gradually decline. What is really important at this time is the &quot;latecomer advantage&quot;, that is, through opening up to the outside world, learning, introduction, digestion, and absorption, and learning more as quickly as possible at a lower cost. Knowledge and technology allow this knowledge to play a role in our country and realize the spillover of knowledge elements. Our development has not only introduced advanced technology and equipment from the beginning, giving full play to our late-mover advantage. Our growth in the past two decades has mainly relied on various knowledge and technologies learned after the opening up, and we have gradually learned the ability to innovate. . Now the Americans are trying to curb our development. They use various means of containment, such as decoupling, cutting off supplies, stopping academic exchanges, restricting overseas students, etc., all of which are to prevent us from exerting our latecomer advantage. They don&#39;t care at all about your comparative advantage, because your comparative advantage is only the cost advantage of some &quot;primary factors&quot; and can only engage in some labor-intensive industries that they don&#39;t care about. What they are really afraid of is how we can quickly use our latecomer advantages to Increasing the &quot;high-quality elements&quot; of knowledge and technology has caused them to lose their comparative advantage in this regard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;You mentioned in your autobiography, While visiting Harvard University, I was very impressed by their graduate training methods. After returning to China, I tried it in the graduate school. What adjustments did you make at that time? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>; Harvard graduate students have to take two years of classes and pass a qualifying exam before they can start writing a thesis. When graduate students take classes, they do not use textbooks, but directly teach papers. Even if they were just published yesterday, as long as everyone thinks they are valuable, the textbooks are only used for reference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;When I returned to China, I felt that China’s graduate education needed to be improved, so I applied for a grant and invited PhD students who had just returned to China or had obtained degrees abroad to For example, Hai Wen, Zhang Weiying and others gave lectures to graduate students in the Academy of Social Sciences, and I myself also gave lectures for two semesters to improve the knowledge level of the graduate school in the Department of Economics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;For today’s young people, especially Do you have any life advice for college students and graduate students? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>;I have never allowed myself to be a &quot;youth mentor&quot;, so I don&#39;t have any life advice. My &quot;suggestion&quot; to myself is that the goal should not be specific to things like position and money, but should think more about how to make something decent and provide my own contribution in order to gain social recognition. From a life perspective, this is true satisfaction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[官方回应“五月天被质疑假唱”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261781]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-03 20:09:02&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a blogger claimed that the two concerts of the well-known pop rock band &quot;Mayday&quot; in Shanghai and London were criticized.

Visual China&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The wild boar was eventually trapped in a river that was more than 3 meters wide and about 200 meters long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At noon on November 29, 2023, this wild boar appeared in Jianye District, Nanjing City from about 5 a.m., which had caused a lot of commotion, and was finally driven by the police to this small road called Nanhubei. In the ditch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the left bank there is a low lawn first, and then there is a palm bush about one meter above. The wild boar is hiding under the palm bush for a while. Dozens of special police officers and auxiliary police officers stood ready with shields and explosion-proof steel forks. Two staff members who came from the Hongshan Zoo Wildlife Conservation and Rescue Center were about 2 meters away from it and prepared anesthetic drugs urgently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the road on the right bank of the river, many residents have stood. In the video shot by netizens, a takeaway brother in the crowd rang the notice of assigning orders, and the voice was kicked off, and no one left; another uncle was carrying a bag of persimmons in his hand and standing onlookers; a lady walked the dog to walk the dog. After, I couldn&#39;t stop looking at the river and began to stop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;We have never seen such new things, and we have never seen it.&quot; Wei Zhennan, deputy director of the Yiyuan Community Neighborhood Committee of Jianye District, Nanjing, told reporters from the Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In Nanjing, the wild boar is the most frequent wildlife. The Nanjing Municipal Government has stated that it will formulate and improve the emergency plan for the disposal of wild boar police. Work. But for Wei Zhennan, such a big movement of hunting wild boars has never been seen before. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Water pigs &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Earlier media reports that the wild boar appeared on a campus in Jian&#39;ou District, Nanjing. After the security guard was found to be worried about the wild pig hurt, he called the police for help. After receiving the police, Nanjing Jianye went to the scene to search, and the wild boar began to rush out of the school and fled around. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A staff member of the Beilei community in Nanhu Street told the southern weekend reporter that when the wild boar came to the community, it was six or seven in the morning. They had not yet went to work. . According to media reports, a security guard in the Beilei community was knocked down and bitten by a wild boar, and was sent to the hospital for six stitches. The above -mentioned staff said that they had to condolences to the injured security guards, but did not disclose the injuries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In Yiyuan community, Wei Zhennan was already more than nine in the morning when he received a property phone call. The other party informed the residents to find that there was a wild boar activity in the jurisdiction. &quot;I thought it was a small wild boar at that time.&quot; Wei Zhennan also felt novel. After checking the monitoring with the community police, he found that at seven o&#39;clock in the morning, the wild boar had strolled in the community. In the monitoring, the wild boar was strong and there were more than two hundred pounds. &quot;So the police quickly requested support.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When Wei Zhennan rushed to the hiding place of the wild boar, the police of Jianye District had begun to take a warning and prepare to be arrested. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Near 11 o&#39;clock, Li Feng (a pseudonym) of the Dynamic Institute of Wildlife Rescue Center of Hongshan Zoo received a call from the 110 Police Center and hurried to the scene. For Li Feng, this is part of his daily work. Every day he receives five or six wild animals for help, involving birds, snakes, wild boars and so on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is dangerous to shoot anesthesia for wild boars. Generally, Li Feng will work with colleagues to work with colleagues. The distance between blowing is 3-5 meters. Li Feng explained that it is far away. The injection cannot be pierced through the pig skin, and the anesthesia drugs are slow. If it is too close, the risk of the staff increases. The wild boar reaction was much faster than people. One time after the wild boar injected anesthesia, the staff chased for nearly two kilometers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This time on the banks of the South Hubei, Li Feng held anesthesia and blowing the pipe, squatted below the palm bush, and slowly poked his head to aim at the wild boar. The first anesthesia needle was shot to the head and neck of the wild boar, and the wild boar drilled out of the palm bush, bumped the police on the side, and soared along the river. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The crowds of the onlookers immediately surged. Police and community staff quickly increased their volume and evacuated the residents of the onlookers. It&#39;s okay. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the video shot by the media, after the wild boar ran hundreds of meters, it returned from the river. Li Feng took advantage of the wild boar to go ashore, and then shot three anesthesia. Li Feng estimated that the anesthesia was effective after about half an hour, and the wild boar was blocked under the bridge hole and took it ashore. However, because the wild boar anesthesia water, it was dying when she went ashore, and died on the way to Hongshan Zoo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After the local media released a live video of catching wild boars, netizens suspected that it was the previous &quot;crossing Jiang Meng pig&quot; -the 12 minutes on November 27 crossed the Yangtze River and went to Nanjing. When crossing the river, Yao Chengyu, the head of the Ship Transportation Management Center of the Nanjing Maritime Safety Administration, found it in the monitoring, watching it flexibly escape many large ships and traffic at high speeds on the water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Tang Xiaofan, director of the Party and Mass Work Department of the Nanjing Maritime Safety Administration, said that although there were many vessels connected by the channel at that time, the wild pigs would not cause the ship to be damaged, but the wild boar was not damaged. It is easy to die. For the staff of the Maritime Bureau, large wild animals like wild boars appear rarely in the river surface, and more common are wildlife such as porpoons and birds. In terms of wildlife protection, they mainly cooperate with the Nanjing Municipal Government departments to delineate the ecological protection zone, forbidden navigation in the ecological reserve, and reduce water quality pollution in the Yangtze River. They do not need to deal with wild boar traffic accidents. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; After the rescue &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; A reporter from the Southern Weekend found that in November 2023, there were many wild pigs in Nanjing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On November 1st, a woman in Jiangning District, Nanjing sat at the door of the restaurant and met wild boars and quickly fled into the store. The restaurant owner said that the aunt in the restaurant was not bitten, and the wild boar left quickly, and they did not call the police. On November 10, the media reported that Mr. Zhou, a citizen of Nanjing, collided with a wild boar while driving, and his vehicle was damaged. Mr. Zhou told the southern weekend that the wild boar was injured after being hit, and passers -by called the Hongshan Zoo Wildlife Acceptance Rescue Center to drag it away. The subsequent friends of Mr. Zhou asked the wild boar treatment and learned that the wild boar could not be saved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Southern Weekend reporters repeatedly called the Nanjing Public Security Bureau to ask the wild boar police situation on December 1 and failed to get a reply. On the website of the Nanjing Municipal Government, a reporter from the southern weekend found that a report was published on July 5, 2022. The Nanjing Garden Greening Bureau&#39;s response to the Nanjing People&#39;s Congress on the proposal of wild boars in rural areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The answer mentioned that in recent years, due to the improvement of the ecological environment, the number of wild pig species in Nanjing has grown rapidly, and the scope of activities has continued to expand. Wild pigs are not. The news of wild boars out of the mountain forests, frequently entered the news of tourist attractions, parks, transportation roads, residential communities, shopping malls, campuses, etc., which has been reported to destroy crops, destroy facilities, and even cause personal injury. One of the hidden dangers of safety. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; From January to May 2022, the Nanjing Public Security Bureau reported a total of 201 parts involving wild boar police conditions, covering many administrative districts in the city, mainly for the traffic accidents caused by the accident caused by the accident, and the invasion of wild boars invaded the wild pig wait. Faced with such alarm situation, the territorial public security organs all sent members to the scene for the first time to deal with it. If the situation is critical and possibly threatened the public&#39;s personal safety, after the on -site evaluation and other standardized processes Work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Li Feng remembers that in 2022, the number of wild boars in Hongshan Zoo was 32, and it was reduced by ten in 2023. He believes that it is about to be removed from the wild boar from the &quot;three&quot; protective animals. In July 2023, the State Forestry and Grassland Bureau officially released the adjustment of the &quot;Land Wild Animal List with important ecology, science, and social value&quot;, and the wild boar is not in this list. This means that wild boars are no longer protecting animals, and further simplify the procedures for wild boar hunting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Li Feng suggested that if the citizens encounter wild boars on the streets and parks, they don&#39;t have to panic. They can be far away from it without being hurt. If there is already an emergency that hurts people and invades the lives of residents, citizens can call the police or call the wildlife rescue center call. After the Redshan Zoo rescue wild animals, it will make an evaluation. Foreign species will stay in the park to raise, and the local species will be about 40%of the fields of home species. &quot;This success rate is quite high.&quot; The rescue process of wild animals is prone to various accidents, such as accidentally drowning after anesthesia in the South Hubei River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Li Feng deliberately mentioned a wild boar rescued from Bazi Mountain Park in 2022. The wild boar has become very docile because of being raised for a long time, and people can even touch it. Hongshan Zoo is worried that it has no survivability in the wild and has been raising in the zoo. &quot;Some tourists are unclear. He thinks that feeding these animals is to protect it, and it actually hurts it.&quot; Li Feng and the team also rescued two wild boars that were fed near the Zhongshan Mausoleum in 2023, and eventually failed to release. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Faced with the increase in the number of wild boars, Nanjing adopted the methods of strengthening the survey of population groups, strengthening the prevention and publicity guidance of wild boar activities. In addition, the Nanjing Garden Greening Bureau has also adopted the method of regulating wild pig species. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The above -mentioned Nanjing Garden Greening Bureau responded that Nanjing City has launched a pilot of wild boar hazards prevention and control work in the Zijinshan area since October 2021. After the expert evaluation and demonstration, the density of the wild pig species in the Zijinshan Monitoring Area has exceeded the control standard. The Nanjing Greening Garden Bureau applied to the Provincial Forestry Bureau for 60 wild pig hunting and hunting limits, and issued an administrative license to the huntering wild boar to the Zhongshan Cemetery Administration. From March 22, 2022 to March 15, 2023, it was launched in the Zijin Mountain area. Wild pig population regulation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Li Feng believes that in recent years, the public has improved the awareness of wildlife protection. Citizens will take the initiative to call for help when they encounter wildlife trapped and wild animals. In 2022, Hongshan Zoo rescued about 1,200 animals, &quot;a wild boar is just a small wave.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 18:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[信用卡质效榜：股份行霸榜前四 城商行高度分化]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261776]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-12-03 17:34:12 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Li Heming Three years later, three years later, the domestic credit card market will be opened to the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; On November 19, 2023, the International Credit Card Organization Giant MasterCard obtained a bank card liquidation business license at the China Holdings Company Monthly, and said it was called Within 6 months, they will expand member institutions in China to authorize the issuance and acceptance of the bank card of the MasterCard brand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; At this time, the Chinese credit card market has shifted from the horsesy circle of the horse-rail-ups to refinement.

There are 6 sub -indicators at this dimension, which are credit card issuance and their changes, credit card loan balances and their proportion, the number of credit card users, and credit card transaction volume. The 6 sub -indicator rights coincide 35%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; (2) Risk management is a necessary dimension to examine the comprehensive strength of each bank&#39;s credit card.

The total right of three sub -indicators coincides with a total of 18%.

Among them, the number of credit card business complaints and their changes can counter the customer&#39;s recognition of the bank&#39;s credit card business, which is a negative indicator.

It is the only way to get expert review and media factors &quot;double full scores&quot;. Bank of. The bank won the championship with a 12 -point leading advantage, reflecting the competitiveness of the bank&#39;s credit card in various aspects such as business, finance and word of mouth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; CITIC Bank won the Guangfa Bank with a weak advantage of 0.24 points, and the two joint-stock banks ranked the credit card quality list runner-up and the third place. Coupled with the fourth -ranking Ping An Bank, in the 2023 new financial competitiveness list released this time, the credit card quality list is also the only sub -list with the top four of the list of dominations by the joint -stock bank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Although external review scoring and media factors have weakened the influence of scale indicators on the list, it is only performed from quantitative qualitative indicators. The score is still the top three. Among them, the balance of credit card loans in Guangfa Bank accounted for 48%of the bank&#39;s personal loan balance, far exceeding the industry, which proves that the credit card business has a huge influence on the bank that has beyond the industry. At the same time, in the case of the overall contraction of credit card card issuance, CITIC Bank and Guangfa Bank&#39;s issuing card volume remains positive, which also shows the good strength of the two joint -stock banks in the credit card business. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; The five major lines are among the top ten &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Although the three major banks have not been shortlisted, all the five major banks in the construction of diplomatic relations between the workers and peasants are among the top ten There is a big bank&#39;s overall strength in the credit card business. The state -owned bank credit card business started earlier, and the customer foundation was huge, and the scale of credit card business has been significantly ahead. However, in recent years, with the fluctuation of credit card assets and the strict supervision of the new rules of credit cards, the invalid and inefficient credit card issued in the early stage has withdrawn from the market. In this long, the scale of large banks in various countries has gradually been ironed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The importance of credit card business to a state-owned bank is not as good as a joint-stock bank. From the perspective of credit card loans in personal loans, the average proportion of credit card loans of the five major banks is 9%, while this indicator of 9 joint -stock banks is as high as 27%. In this sense, under the circumstances that the entry time, the scale of assets, and the customer base are in the overall disadvantage, the joint -stock bank can occupy half of the country in the credit card market, and the comprehensive competitiveness of the opponent is obvious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Therefore, the ranking of the five major banks in the credit card quality list is just right. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; Head City Commercial Bank is catching up &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; 5 city commercial bank credit card scores are highly differentiated. Among them, Ningbo Bank&#39;s comprehensive score is second only to ICBC, ranking 6th. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In the first half of 2023, the bank&#39;s credit card issuance volume increased by 40%year-on-year, ranking first in 20 banks; The non -performing rate of credit cards is only 1.19%, which performs the best in the industry. While maintaining an ultra -low credit card adverse rate, the bank&#39;s credit card adverse rate is still on the downward channel, which is even more difficult. This reflects that the head city commercial bank is trying to catch up in the credit card business, and has made great progress on some indicators. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Compared to Bank of Ningbo, the other four city commercial bank scores rank at the tail, showing that they still have a significant gap with large and medium-sized banks in terms of credit card comprehensive strength. Affected by factors such as the short time of the credit card market, the smaller business scale, and the weaker customer foundation, the four city commercial banks overall have lagged more on indicators such as credit card issuance and credit card loan balance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;br>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 17:55:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
