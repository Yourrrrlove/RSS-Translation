Image source: Believe Music official Weibo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2023, the pop rock band &quot;Mayday&quot;, which has been in the industry for 26 years, was involved in a lip-synching controversy at a concert. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The blogger &quot;Wheatfield Farmer&quot; compared the vocals and song track lines at Mayday&#39;s Shanghai concert, and pointed out that 5 of the 12 songs performed by Mayday were lip-syncing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On December 4, Mayday’s management company Believe Music responded: There is no lip-synching and a statement will be issued. The concert audio has been submitted to the inspection department, and the relevant departments will conduct scientific evaluation and analysis and publish the investigation results. As of press time, there is no clear result on whether it was &quot;lip-syncing&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ding Dang, Liu Ruoying and other artists affiliated with Believe Music all expressed their voices for Mayday on Weibo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On Zhihu, some Mayday fans mentioned that lip-synching is not new this year, it was discovered in 2019. Mayday lead singer Ashin (Chen Xinhong) also took a blockade injection for a performance, which caused many fans to feel &quot;heartbroken&quot; and repeatedly called on them to hold less concerts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2023, 48-year-old Ashin said at a concert in Chengdu, &quot;Some people say that music treats Mayday as a cash cow. If Mayday doesn&#39;t want to sing, no one can force us. If Monster, Martha, Shitou, Guanyou, and Ashin want to sing, and no one can stop us.&quot; Today, the five members are all between 46 and 50 years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;From 20 shows a year to 60 shows a year&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Mayday can be said to be an indelible imprint of youth in the hearts of a generation, and this sentiment has become the driving force behind its concert box office market. Appeal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2023, Mayday held 6 concerts with 40,000 people at the Beijing Bird&#39;s Nest with the dual themes of &quot;I Want to See You So Much&quot; and &quot;Noah&#39;s Ark 10th Anniversary Evolution Reissue Limited Edition&quot;; Guangzhou Olympic Stadium There were 5 concerts, attracting 175,000 people; 8 concerts in Shanghai, the total audience exceeded 360,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, Mayday held 19 concerts in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou this year, with an audience of about 700,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tickets for the Shanghai concert ranged from 355 yuan to 1,855 yuan each. They were sold out as soon as they opened, and many fans said it was hard to get a ticket. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fans who went to the concert wore Mayday’s exclusive logo, waved blue fluorescent sticks in their hands, and some wore black Mayday peripheral shirts. Fans can purchase peripherals online in advance or at the concert. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take light sticks as an example. A cloud-based interactive light stick costs 140 yuan, the light stick protective cover webbing is 50 yuan, and the light stick sticker is 40 yuan. During a concert, there were as many as 19 types of Mayday peripheral products, with prices ranging from 40 yuan to 1,050 yuan. If fans want to collect all peripheral products, they will need to spend a total of 5,244 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the number of viewers of the 8 concerts in Shanghai, the revenue from tickets and peripheral products (only counting the price of a single light stick) was at least 178 million yuan, that is, the average revenue per game started at 20 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why should one city do multiple shows? The more tours there are at a single stop, the cost of clothing, video production, stage construction, etc. will also be diluted, and the profit margin will be larger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics from Southern Weekend reporters, in 2023, Mayday’s dual-theme switching tour will have a total of 68 performances, covering 21 cities, including 12 mainland cities. Among the singers who held concerts this year, Mayday ranked second in terms of number of concerts, with 40-year-old Joker Xue occupying the first place with 104 official concerts. Joker Xue once canceled a concert in Chengdu due to a sudden high fever that caused tonsil discomfort. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;68 concerts a year, which is equivalent to a frequency of five or six concerts per month. On average, it can be said that there are concerts every week. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mayday’s role as a “model worker” in concerts did not start this year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 2004 to 2006, Mayday held the &quot;Final Home When We Mix Together&quot; world tour concert, which traveled to 11 cities around the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The then deputy general manager of Believe Music (Beijing) Li Yixun once told the media that they held two rounds of Mayday tours with different themes from 2007 to 2008, with a total of 23 performances and attracting more than 300,000 people. Watch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2017 marks the 20th anniversary of the founding of Mayday. The youngest member among them is already forty years old, but they are more diligent than when they were young, singing almost from the beginning to the end of the year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;LIFE Life Unlimited Company&quot; theme concert was launched in March 2017 and lasted until January 2019, with a total of 122 concerts, an average of nearly 60 concerts per year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After only three months of rest, Mayday went to Osaka, Japan in April 2019 to hold a new theme concert &quot;Just Rock It!!! BLUE&quot;. They held 28 concerts in Osaka, Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, and Taoyuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The new crown epidemic has forced the non-stop Mayday to stop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2020, in order to stick to the &quot;May Agreement&quot; with music fans, Mayday teamed up with Tencent TME to hold an online concert, which was watched by more than 35 million fans online. On the last day of 2020, Mayday launched a concert with the theme &quot;I Really Want to See You&quot; and performed six consecutive shows in Taoyuan, Taiwan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, the world is still affected by the epidemic. This year, Mayday held 14 concerts in Taoyuan, Tainan and Kaohsiung, Taiwan. In 2022, they will also tour Las Vegas, New York, and Singapore. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2022, another new-themed &quot;Noah&#39;s Ark 10th Anniversary Evolution Reproduction Limited Edition Concert&quot; will start in Taoyuan. At the same time, the &quot;I Really Want to See You&quot; concert is also going on. This theme spans four continents, with a total of 78 performances. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that after Mayday joined Believe Music, releasing records was no longer the main development path, and concerts became its main job. Concerts are held with different themes almost every year, and there are even two themed concerts in the same year, and the number of concerts has expanded from more than 20 a year to more than 60 a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past five years, except for the two years affected by the epidemic, there have been more than 60 games every year, and this year it is close to 70 games. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The actual controller of Believe Music was once Mayday’s manager&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Believe Music was founded with the intention of adopting a different business model from traditional record distribution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The profit logic of the traditional record era relies on the production and distribution of records. The better the record sells and the greater the distribution, the higher the profit. Royalties are distributed between record companies and creators. What major record stores compete for is the volume of releases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The emergence of pirated optical discs has destroyed the original mature business logic. Coupled with the impact of digital music and online downloads, the record industry has plummeted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2006, Believe Music founders Chen Yongzhi and Xie Zhifen recruited Mayday and Rene Liu to form a new company. Chen Yongzhi was the chief strategy officer of Rolling Stone Group at the time, and Xie Zhifen was Mayday&#39;s manager. The two established Believe Music International Co., Ltd. (referred to as Believe Music) in Taipei. According to Qichacha, the chairman is Chen Yongzhi, Wu Jieying and Xie Peiling are directors, and Hong Huizhen is the supervisor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rolling Stone Records is a local record company in Taiwan. Li Zongsheng, Luo Dayou, Liu Rene, Zhou Huajian, Tao Zhe, Liang Jingru, Mayday, etc. are all from Rolling Stone. At present, among the artists who believe in music are old Rolling Stones, such as Li Zongsheng, Rene Liu, and Su Huilun. For a certain period of time, Rolling Stone still played the role of a trusted music record publisher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Chen Yongzhi’s intention to form a new company is also obvious. The industry’s original “record sales” model is no longer viable, and a new business model needs to be found. Looking at it today, the new model can be said to be the &quot;fan economy&quot;, with concerts, celebrity peripherals, and audio-visual product publishing as the main sources of income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2007, Believe Music Culture Media (Beijing) Co., Ltd. was established. The actual controller is Xie Zhifen, accounting for 92.5% of the shares, and Chen Yongzhi 7.5%. This company is responsible for the music works managed by Believe Music in China. Matters related to the mainland area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I believe that during the music period, Mayday did not put too much energy into record production, and usually only released new albums in three to five years. Especially after 2012, Mayday mostly released adapted versions of concert selections or singles, and the focus of their work every year was on tours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Believe in Music even set up a department specifically for Mayday and Liang Jingru to serve concerts. The head of the department, Zhou Youyang, was called a &quot;foreign man&quot; by Mayday members. This department first became famous for planning the &quot;Left the Surface of the Earth&quot; concert in Mayday. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to reports from Taiwan Juheng.com, Mayday accounts for 70% of Believe Music’s annual revenue. Once Mayday does not have a film or concert that year, the revenue of Believe Music will fluctuate too much. This is also the case for Believe Music. The reason why music has never been released on the market. Taiwan Juheng.com is a professional financial website in Taiwan. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Mayday Concept Stock&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2014, with the support of Believe Music, &quot;Foreign Man&quot; led the Believe Music concert production department and integrated four behind-the-scenes production companies in the industry to establish a separate company The company, called Bing Creates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The official website of Bing Creation shows that the top three shareholders are Xiangzhi Co., Ltd., Rolling Stone Mobile Co., Ltd., and Believe Music International Co., Ltd., accounting for 12.25%, 8.65%, and 7.59% respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiangzhi Co., Ltd. was funded and established by Believe Music, and the actual controller is Chen Yongzhi. Based on this calculation, I believe Music holds a total of 19.84% of Bing’s shares, making it the largest shareholder. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, Bing Creation (6625-TW) was listed in Taiwan and was called a &quot;Mayday concept stock&quot; by investors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 2022 financial report shows that Bing generated revenue of NT$1.088 billion. After deducting costs and expenses, the net operating profit was NT$24.91 million, and the net operating profit rate was 2%. In non-epidemic years, the operating net profit margin is approximately between 4% and 8%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first half of 2023, the operating net profit margin will rebound to 8%. Generally speaking, the peak season for concert activities is in the second half of the year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main revenue generated by Bing is equipment rental, performance or event production design and hardware engineering, exhibition tickets, and sales of peripheral products for exhibitions and activities. Among the main revenue generated by Bing, performance event production design and hardware engineering revenue accounted for 97%. According to the prospectus created by Bing, the record industry is in decline, and the main source of income for record companies and singers is gradually turning to concert income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Believe Music and its group member companies are all listed as related persons created by Bing. Its operating income from Believe Music is NT$190 million, accounting for 18.31% of the total revenue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;B&#39;IN MUSIC (HK) CO. LIMITED (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Believe Music Hong Kong Company&quot;), which Ashin participates in as a shareholder, is a substantial related party of Bing Creation and brings 6.775 million to Bing Creation. NT$ income. Believe Music Hong Kong Company was established in 2017 by Believe Music. After October 2022, it will be jointly held by Chen Yongzhi, Xie Zhifen, and Ashin (Chen Xinhong), each accounting for 33% of the shares, and Wu Jieying 1%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the financial statements of Bing Creation in the past three years since its listing, from 2016 to 2018, the revenue was NT$790 million, NT$830 million, and NT$1.423 billion respectively, of which the proportion of revenue from Believe Music are 23%, 25.63%, and 10.1%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to Mayday, Li Zongsheng, Liu Ruoying and other artists affiliated with Believe Music, Bing Creation also undertakes artist concert production projects from non-affiliated companies. According to the official website of Bing Creation, Bing Creation is the first performance service provider to be listed in Taiwan and has now become one of the largest concert production companies in the Chinese world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 21:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[专访奥地利前总理沃尔夫冈·许塞尔：“全球化和国际贸易带来了富裕和繁荣”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261998]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-06 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“儿科荒”背后：人手紧待遇低，老难题探寻新解法]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261992]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-06 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 12/06/sPqnPg9QSrYjnUMPnNWa8AsZHtc9zH243A2pKvpO.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/sPqnPg9QSrYjnUMPnNWa8AsZHt c9zH243A2pKvpO. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260899&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On December 3, 2023, Chongqing Children’s Hospital, parents took their children to wait for treatment &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On December 2, 2023, the National Health Commission held a press conference to introduce the prevention and treatment of respiratory diseases in winter relevant situation. Mi Feng, spokesperson of the National Health Commission, said that at present, the National Health Commission, together with the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the State Administration of Disease Control and Prevention, continue to carry out winter respiratory disease monitoring and research and judgment, and are doing a good job in allocating medical resources, optimizing the medical treatment process, and playing a central role. Medical functions and other work are deployed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to monitoring, the currently prevalent acute respiratory diseases are all caused by known pathogens and have corresponding mature treatments. No new infectious diseases caused by new viruses or bacteria have been found. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The superimposed and high incidence of multiple pathogens makes this wave of respiratory disease infections another major test for the medical system after the COVID-19 epidemic. In addition to continuing to implement and improve the hierarchical diagnosis and treatment system and improving the general awareness of primary medical and health institutions, The old problem of long-term shortage of pediatric medical resources, including infection diagnosis and treatment capabilities and severe illness identification and referral efficiency, has once again attracted widespread attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On December 4, the General Office of the National Health Commission issued the &quot;Notice on Guiding Primary Medical and Health Institutions to Provide Health Services for Respiratory Diseases in Winter and Spring&quot;, which proposed requirements for pediatric diagnosis and treatment services in primary medical and health institutions. Multiple requirements: Primary medical and health institutions in various places must be fully open to children and must not refuse treatment; general hospitals should strengthen support for primary medical and health institutions; each primary medical and health institution should have at least one general practitioner to complete the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric diseases. For work training, at least two nurses must complete pediatric treatment training to speed up the improvement of grassroots capabilities in carrying out pediatric and respiratory disease diagnosis and treatment in winter and spring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/7vnmI7YsuZVNfWIQF54VZRvqXibOtPiBWFsieCgq.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/7vnmI7YsuZVNfWIQF54VZRvqXibOtPiBWFsieCgq.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260895&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On November 29, 2023, in Shanghai, many children patients were still queuing up for treatment in the emergency department at Children&#39;s Hospital at night&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Immune gap&quot;? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In November, the pediatric clinics of various hospitals in Beijing have been full. The waiting time for outpatient and emergency services at Daxing Hospital and Friendship Hospital even reached more than 24 hours. The emergency infusion center of Beijing Children’s Hospital received nearly 2,000 calls. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dai Jia, a pediatrician at a comprehensive university hospital in Beijing, sees more than 120 patients every day. Even for night emergencies, the number of outpatient and emergency visits is two or three times that of 2019. Due to the large number of patients being treated, the department will rotate a doctor on duty in the ward to support the outpatient department every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beyond Beijing, the pediatric wards of hospitals in Tianjin, Liaoning, Shanghai, Guangdong and other places are also operating at full capacity. The average daily emergency department attendance at the Panyu Campus of Guangdong Maternal and Child Health Hospital has reached more than 800, exceeding the spring flu peak in Guangzhou in March 2023. The outpatient and emergency departments of Sun Yat-sen University Affiliated Hospital are fully booked, and it is common to wait in line for several hours. Dozens of inpatient beds have also been reserved, waiting to be freed up to treat children with pneumonia. But in general, hospitals in Guangzhou are much more relaxed than Beijing. At least in the waiting hall, everyone has a seat and an infusion pole. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When influenza is prone to occur every spring and winter, there will be a peak period for consultations in pediatric clinics, but this year’s round of respiratory tract infections lasts particularly long. An Yang, a pediatric resident at a tertiary hospital in Guangzhou, has been working intensively for several months. “Since August and September, drug-resistant mycoplasma infections have been present, and they have eased for a while, but B and A have started again. , and may overlap, and the symptoms will be more severe.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ward managed by Anyang is in a saturated state all year round. If a child who needs hospitalization is found, the outpatient and emergency doctors will first ask if there are any children in the ward. There are no beds. If they cannot be vacated temporarily, the doctor will provide emergency infusion and symptomatic treatment. At the same time, it is recommended to consult other hospitals for bed inpatient treatment. In fact, most children who come to the outpatient and emergency department have mild symptoms assessed by doctors and can be treated with oral medications and observe the effects. For children with more severe conditions, intravenous administration may be considered. Anyang and colleagues found that one of the characteristics of this round of Mycoplasma pneumoniae is the high rate of drug resistance. &quot;Azithromycin, commonly used in pediatric treatment, is not effective orally, and the intravenous effect is not as good as before.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot; Azithromycin is still used in pediatrics. Azithromycin has been used in pediatrics for a long time, and there is a lot of experience in clinical observation of drug effects and adverse reactions. If quinolones and tetracyclines are abused, the gains may outweigh the losses.&quot; Anyang said, the 2023 edition of &quot;Children&#39;s Guide&quot; issued by the National Health Commission In the &quot;Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Mycoplasma Pneumonia&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Guidelines&quot;&lt;/span>;), in addition to the macrolide antibiotics represented by azithromycin, New tetracyclines and quinolones have also been recommended, but their side effects have been repeatedly emphasized: new tetracyclines may affect enamel development and cause yellowing of teeth, and are not recommended for children under 8 years old; quinolones may affect cartilage development and increase tendons. Risk of breakage, not recommended for use by children under 18 years of age. &quot;Nowadays, partial drug resistance gene testing of Mycoplasma pneumoniae can be done, and the results can be obtained quickly. However, azithromycin is generally used to observe the efficacy first. If clinical drug resistance is found, the drug resistance gene test will be used to determine whether to use other antibiotics for treatment.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Computational biologists at University College London said in a statement to the UK&#39;s Science Media Center that lockdown measures implemented to slow the spread of the new coronavirus have prevented the spread of seasonal pathogens and reduced people&#39;s ability to build immunity to these microorganisms. opportunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The World Health Organization (WHO) mentioned a similar statement - the new crown epidemic may have caused an immunity gap (immunity gap). During the epidemic, the spread of other viruses and bacteria decreased sharply, which may cause some children to Lack of immune defense against influenza, respiratory syncytial virus and other viruses that cause colds. An immune gap is a deficiency in protective immunity caused by chronic low exposure to a specific pathogen, leaving a greater proportion of the population susceptible to the disease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above statement is still controversial, and Anyang is not convinced. He believes that this is related to the popular microorganism itself. There will be a pandemic year every few years. &quot;Maybe this year&#39;s mycoplasma is special.&quot; What he feels is special is that mycoplasma pneumonia is prone to occur in children aged 5 to 14 years old, but this year people of all ages are infected. He was also suspected of being infected before. He coughed continuously for two or three weeks and took medicine by himself for a week. , using an atomizer. He didn&#39;t have a diagnosis because he didn&#39;t have time to get tested. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/6q2cRNAHhyMqD2lD8A9CZVYx7gDgjYd1sTxmDwfq.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;694&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/6q2cRNAHhyMqD2lD8A9CZVYx7gDgjYd1sTxmDwfq.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260903&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On November 29, 2023, Children&#39;s Hospital Affiliated to Capital Institute of Pediatrics, children and their families waiting outside the clinic&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(South People Weekly reporter Liang Chen/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Big hospital superstition&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Ideally, tertiary hospitals should not be the first choice for pneumonia patients. &quot;Go to the community first.&quot; Hospitals provide oral antibiotics. Some people will recover gradually, but some people will not recover. Then they go to a large hospital and undergo outpatient treatment, and then screen out the severe patients.&quot; However, hierarchical diagnosis and treatment in pediatrics is generally more difficult, and An Yang has almost never seen patients who take antibiotics. Patients who come to see a doctor based on their community hospital visit records. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Actually, as long as you follow the guidelines, the medication is almost the same. It depends on whether they can judge the serious condition in time.&quot; As long as the judgment of the serious condition is not delayed, Anyang feels that the treatment in community hospitals is not much different from that in tertiary hospitals. &quot;Severe symptoms are more obvious, such as low blood pressure, shortness of breath, and obvious white lesions on the chest X-ray.&quot; The severe rate of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection is relatively low. In the Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhongshan Hospital, which is densely populated, patients are transferred to the ICU every day (&lt;span style There are 1 to 2 critically ill patients in the Intensive Care Unit&lt;/span>;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Part of the &quot;big hospital superstition&quot; in pediatrics stems from the reality. Pediatrics are highly dependent on clinical experience, and their diagnosis ideas are very different from those of adults. Parents will trust hospitals with greater patient volume; secondly, large hospitals The medical resources in China are more abundant, but some grassroots hospitals have limited conditions. There are no night clinics, no tests, and no X-rays. &quot;For more complex diseases, the local second-level hospitals will directly recommend them to us.&quot; Anyang said that over time, many people will skip the first- and second-level hospitals and go straight to the third-level hospitals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhu Xiaochun, chief physician of the neonatal surgery department of the Panyu Campus of Guangdong Maternal and Child Health Hospital, believes that parents’ emphasis on their children is also the reason why they choose large hospitals. Not long ago, a friend of Zhu Xiaochun&#39;s child had a high fever. He had already seen the best pediatrician in the local county hospital and called Zhu Xiaochun to consult about his condition. He was still worried and had to drive hundreds of kilometers to the Provincial Maternal and Child Health Care Center. See a doctor in the hospital. I spent thousands of dollars on metagenomic testing of pathogenic microorganisms (mNGS) and found out that I was infected with a rare mycoplasma. “It actually doesn’t mean much, it’s still a mycoplasma infection. After becoming resistant to azithromycin, I switched to tetracycline and my fever went away.” Some.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, a friend suggested that &quot;the child&#39;s mental state is not good&quot; and he saw the respiratory department and neurology department. The neurologist suggested that he stop taking the medicine for a few days and then consider whether to do anything based on his mental state. lumbar puncture. After my friend stopped taking the medicine for three days, he took his child to Chimelong Paradise and told Zhu Xiaochun that &quot;the child is fine.&quot; Zhu Xiaochun summed it up: &quot;Many times it is the parents&#39; nervousness that causes doctors to passively over-treat. If the doctor doesn&#39;t do this, the parents will blame you.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gao Jie, a pediatric respiratory doctor, encountered Many parents ask for blood tests as soon as they arrive. She opposes excessive testing. If the patient&#39;s symptoms are very typical, she will directly provide empirical treatment to save time. But she also understands the parent&#39;s appeal, &quot;He will feel that he has been queuing for 8 hours and needs to get checked. If he doesn&#39;t do it, he will go back. Queuing for such a long time is a sunk cost. If it were me, I would get a test As a result, I feel confident.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An Yang found that the biggest feature of this round of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection is that &quot;parents are generally anxious&quot;, &quot;I was very anxious before hospitalization, and rushed to be discharged after staying for two days. After a slight improvement, they are asking when they will be discharged from the hospital. The children have to go to school. They have missed classes and mid-term exams. Especially for children who have just entered elementary school or the first grade of junior high school, parents are particularly worried about the long absence from school. If you can’t keep up, it will be difficult to integrate into the class.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the guidelines, the treatment course for pneumonia is 7 to 14 days, but even children who are hospitalized with severe symptoms will not be able to stay for a full course of treatment due to the shortage of hospital beds. . But this does not mean that children can go to school. &quot;In the later stages of (respiratory tract infections) diseases, the airways will be in a more sensitive stage and are easily infected by other bacteria and viruses again.&quot; Regarding this round of infection peak, Anyang In addition to public health common sense such as washing hands frequently and wearing masks, the advice also includes &quot;don&#39;t be so anxious to go to school.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/0LLECBPfqAVrF3oHxhPdqAFg7vxfhYzrpbcdadqa.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/0LLECBPfqAVrF3oHxhPdqAFg7vxfhYzrpbcdadqa.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260901&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guangdong Maternal and Child Health Hospital Panyu Campus, children using atomizers&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Nie Yangxin/picture )&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;It is normal for pediatricians to be busy&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The continuation of this wave of infections has put direct pressure on pediatricians on duty in outpatient and emergency departments, but for those who have just worked for three years and are still serving as For An Yang, a resident physician, the impact is not big. &quot;The pediatric wards of tertiary hospitals are generally in full working conditions. There are no (empty) beds at any time. Either this disease or that disease, there is always one to be admitted.&quot; .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Anyang chose pediatrics for a very practical reason, &quot;My score in the postgraduate entrance examination is not high, so I have to find a major with good employment first.&quot; The shortage of pediatricians is normal, both in large hospitals and primary hospitals. The &quot;2015 China Health Statistics Yearbook&quot; shows that since 2010, the total number of pediatricians in China has dropped from 105,000 to 100,000, with an average of only 0.43 pediatricians per 1,000 children, which is equivalent to the national average of 2.06 physicians per 1,000 people. They are far apart, so the conditions for admissions and employment in pediatrics are more relaxed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the comprehensive appeal of pediatrics is still not strong. It was not until after working that An Yang deeply understood why his brothers and sisters advised everyone not to study pediatrics. For new doctors, there are too many things to learn and memorize in pediatrics. Other doctors only need to be proficient in part of the content, while pediatrics requires further subdivisions. Moreover, children of different ages have different levels of organ growth and development and different physiological characteristics, which leads to poor diagnosis. The indicators and dosages are different. &quot;Many drugs do not have clear dosages for children, and most of them are still used empirically.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Anyang also needs to learn how to coax children from scratch, &quot;In the beginning, talk to children When interacting with others, it was difficult to behave in a childish way, but it gradually got better. Some children prefer funny voices, so you have to explain the problem to them in a child&#39;s tone.&quot; For children who really can&#39;t listen, you can only When he was crying, An Yang saw a doctor. Now his tolerance for crying has been greatly improved. &quot;I don&#39;t feel it if you make a fuss next to me.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sometimes the patient&#39;s cooperation will be poor. Directly affects diagnosis and treatment. Anyang would secretly perform liver and spleen palpation while the children were asleep, because when they cried, the entire abdominal wall was hard and &quot;impossible to touch.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Children will be given sedatives before doing some more complex examinations, but the examining doctor is unwilling to bear the risk of medication, so Anyang needs to accompany the child with sedatives for examinations - queuing, examination, It takes a lot of time to wait for the results, and there are other children&#39;s problems in the ward that need to be dealt with, so the working hours are extended indefinitely. Anyang only has half a day to one day off every week. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the pediatric department where Anyang works, according to the division of work responsibilities, an attending doctor only works with 1-2 resident doctors and has to manage more than a dozen beds. The shortage of staff is obvious, but the hospital has no plans to recruit people and relies entirely on the support of &quot;regular trainees&quot; - medical graduates with a bachelor&#39;s degree or above who are new to medical positions must undergo three years of standardized residency training. The low income of graduates during the training period is the main way for hospitals to alleviate staff shortages at low cost. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although he has not been working for a long time, Anyang has clearly understood that pediatrics cannot bring higher economic benefits to the hospital. &quot;The hospital also has to consider revenue and expenditure, so what incentive does it have to recruit pediatricians?&quot;&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/XUPRhTDWswffE5pT7YKoHNCSTRRDC2aFVXkulRBE.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640 &quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/XUPRhTDWswffE5pT7YKoHNCSTRRDC2aFVXkulRBE.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260902&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: # 999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Parents and children waiting to be called in the emergency waiting room at the Panyu Campus of Guangdong Maternal and Child Health Hospital&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Nie Yangxin/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;If you can choose, how to choose?&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Doctors are trained and hard-working.&quot; Zhu Xiaochun has been in Guangdong Maternal and Child Health Hospital Although he is the chief physician, he is still very busy. On the afternoon of the afternoon when he was interviewed by Southern People Weekly, he read all the patients who came to register, but the interview was still interrupted by patients who wanted to add more patients. A parent took his child to the imaging department after 4 p.m. The imaging department was already doing the finishing work, and the nurse asked him to do the examination again tomorrow. After Zhu Xiaochun heard about it, he called the imaging department to coordinate, &quot;The patient is from out of town. It is not easy to come here. It is a big help if he can help.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Usually there are 36 patients in a half-day consultation. Zhu Xiaochun could add up to 45 numbers at most. &quot;If you can see it, let others see it.&quot; The registration system was closed at 11:45 in the morning, but he continued to add numbers until 13:30. Patients who could not be registered were not counted. workload. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pediatrics is a &quot;dumb department&quot;. Children cannot accurately describe their physiological conditions, which makes pediatric diagnosis more difficult. Doctors must be experienced and patient. Zhu Xiaochun sees several children with &quot;stomach pain&quot; every time he visits a doctor. The children can&#39;t tell where the pain is, so they just say it hurts everywhere. &quot;You have to find the cause accurately. If it&#39;s a complication from surgery, you have to make a prompt decision.&quot; Otherwise, serious complications may occur. Sometimes there is a lot of reasoning involved in the diagnosis process.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A child who complained of stomachache said he was beaten by two classmates. After punching him, Zhu Xiaochun first asked him to check to see if he had injured his internal organs, but no obvious problems were found. After careful questioning, I found that the child had some diarrhea. In the end, other causes were ruled out, and it was basically concluded that the stomachache was caused by diarrhea. &quot;You can&#39;t limit yourself to his words. Sometimes it just happens.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pediatrics is periodically overcrowded with consultations every year. Internal medicine is at the peak of seasonal influenza, and surgery is during the summer vacation—every summer, urology is the place to go. Pediatric offices are crowded with surgically circumcised children. As the director of the pediatric surgery department, Zhu Xiaochun needs to balance the work intensity of the department. In 2022, he transferred an attending doctor from the cardiorenal surgery department to support the urology department. This year, he really can&#39;t find anyone. Some doctors want to go to the countryside for free clinics and have to work at the transfer center. The hospital has no new recruits, so he can only wait for himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There are only more than 8,000 pediatric surgeons in the country.” Zhu Xiaochun said that he believed the main reason was that pediatric treatment was so poor. In late November, he went to a free clinic in the county. The chief surgeon of a hospital said that the pediatric surgeons in his hospital were no longer willing to work. “Surgeries in small hospitals are all on the first floor, and the breast surgery is next to the pediatric surgery. Breast surgery is so easy.” , low risk, high performance. If you treat the same number of patients, pediatric surgery will be exhausted. The difference in effort is clear at a glance, but the performance is similar. If you can make a choice, how to choose?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Exploring new Solution&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The &quot;pediatrics shortage&quot; has been around for a long time. In 1998, the pediatrics major was eliminated from the undergraduate education of medical schools and replaced by the clinical medicine major. The pediatrics major was not subdivided until the graduate level. In 1999, undergraduate enrollment in pediatrics was suspended nationwide, and it was not resumed until 2016, when the “universal two-child” policy was implemented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, the National Health Commission issued an implementation plan for the implementation of the 2021-2030 Outline for the Development of Women and Children in China. The plan points out that by 2030, there will be 1.12 pediatric practicing (assistant) doctors per 1,000 children, and the number of beds will increase to 3.17. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A doctor interviewed believes that in order to attract more people to choose pediatrics, the scores for the postgraduate entrance examination and practicing physician examination have been lowered. The hospital’s recruitment conditions for pediatric medical staff are also looser than those for adult departments, but in fact The effect is not good, and there is still a shortage of people in pediatrics because the crux of the problem has not been solved. “If departments like pediatrics and emergency departments, which are tired, hard-working and have little money, want to attract talents and reverse the talent gap, the most direct stimulus is to increase the investment of resources in the department and increase the income of the medical staff in the department. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the context of the “pediatric shortage”, the promotion of hierarchical diagnosis and treatment is particularly important to alleviate the “difficulty in pediatric medical care”. In 2015, the &quot;Guiding Opinions of the General Office of the State Council on Promoting the Construction of a Hierarchical Diagnosis and Treatment System&quot; was released, which clarified the concept of hierarchical diagnosis and treatment and proposed a model of first diagnosis at the grassroots level, two-way referral, acute and chronic treatment, and linkage between the upper and lower levels. Article 30 of the Basic Medical Care and Health Promotion Law, which came into effect in June 2020, once again emphasizes that &quot;the state promotes the implementation of a hierarchical diagnosis and treatment system for basic medical services and guides non-emergency patients to seek treatment at primary medical and health institutions first.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the statistical bulletin on the development of my country&#39;s health industry, in the past five years, the number of diagnoses and treatments in hospitals at all levels accounted for about 45% of the total number of diagnoses and treatments in medical and health institutions nationwide, and primary medical and health institutions accounted for about 50%, of which townships The diagnosis and treatment volume of health centers and community health service centers (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Station&lt;/span>;) is about 24%, which is more than 80% in developed countries. The number of medical visits that occur in medical institutions outside hospitals is still far behind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to promote the implementation of hierarchical diagnosis and treatment, large hospitals will form a consortium of public medical institutions with grassroots hospitals. Zhu Xiaochun introduced that Guangdong Maternal and Child Health Hospital has established a medical consortium with more than 100 units to provide technical support and supplement medical resources. “We will go to villages and towns to give lectures to the specialty alliances of the medical consortium and conduct remote consultations online. , allowing patients with mild symptoms to stay at the grassroots level, and allowing patients who must be transferred to be transferred in time. After our patients are stabilized after surgery, they can also be transferred to grassroots hospitals to achieve two-way referral.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; General practitioner Wu Tianlong has worked at the Wenhua Community Health Service Center in Luohu District, Shenzhen (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 混体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as &quot;social health&quot;&lt;/span>;) for 13 years He believes that the linkage of the social Kang and the superior hospital is a benign two -way interaction. &quot;We have the opportunity to go to the higher -level hospital for the training of sub -specialty. It is also the regulatory base of Shenzhen People&#39;s Hospital. In the first half of the year of our social Kang, medical students can learn the skills of pediatrics and many public health services. &quot; , They are all in the whole department. Wu Tianlong feels that it can basically meet the needs of the community. &quot;Now many community residents will choose to see a doctor in the social Kang, and will not go to the large hospital. Respiratory disease is also an essential skill for Dr. Social Kang. Wu Tianlong depends on 60 or 70 patients in one day, with an average of 8 to 10 minutes of patients. Two -thirds of them are children, and most of them are respiratory diseases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The hierarchical diagnosis and treatment of Shenzhen Social Kang is at the forefront of the country. In the peak of the heat in December 2022, the Social Kangfa heat clinic &quot;carried&quot; 65%of the diagnosis and treatment. In order to mobilize the enthusiasm of the people to go to the social health center, Shenzhen requires basic medical insurance to participate in the second and third -speed insured, and should choose a social health center in this city as a fixed -point medical institution for medical treatment. The organization of the institution and the information of social health realizes mutual recognition of inspection results and interoperability of medical resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The most critical is &quot;raising the internal interest mechanism&quot;, Li Chuang, deputy director of the Shenzhen Municipal Health and Health Commission, summarized, &quot;Let the doctors in large hospitals have the motivation to transfer patients; doctors at the Social Kang Center have the motivation to have motivation for motivation. Transfer to patients. Patients can finally consciously choose Social Kang Center. In the end, there is still a long way to go. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p style =&quot; font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti; stkaiti; stkaiti; stkaiti; &quot;>; (The requirements of the interview, An Yang and Dai Jia in the article are pseudonym.

At present, green power transactions are mainly large enterprises and foreign trade enterprises. SMEs are still &quot;onlookers&quot; of Green Electric Transactions. The data also shows that in 2022, the number of renewable energy power in the country reached 2.7 trillion kWh, and the transaction volume of green power transactions accounted for only 0.84%of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The reason, the Energy Foundation supports the &quot;China Green Electric Electric Consumption path Research Report&quot; released by the Energy Foundation to support the Evaluation Certification Center. The weight of the liability for consumption is mainly through the protection of the power of the power grid enterprise. The assessment indicators have not been decomposed and implemented on the electricity sales company or electricity users that should be evaluated; the green power trading market has not effectively formed a market -oriented pricing mechanism. &quot;Green power consumption,&quot; only when the supply of green power in the region cannot meet the demand for elimination, it will consider purchasing cheaper green electricity outside the outside. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; From this perspective, how to promote market entities with different volumes to participate in green power transactions in the future will be the focus of decision makers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Zheng Ying, a special researcher at the China Carbon Central and Fifty-People Forum, and Director of the Double Carbon Division of Beijing Electric Chain Technology, believes that the &quot;dual carbon&quot; policy has gradually advanced In the following, whether large -scale enterprises or small and medium -sized enterprises are facing internal and external emission reduction constraints and pressures are increasing, and participating in the long -term transactions of green power or purchase of green certificates will become an important way to reduce emission reduction. &quot;In the future, the energy consumption dual -control assessment and even the dual -carbon emission dual -control assessment will become the main battlefield for Green Power/Green to apply in the country.&quot; p style = &quot;Text-Align: Left;&quot;>; Throughout the 2021 and 20122 Chinese enterprises Green Electric Trading Ranking of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, it can be found that companies active in the green power market are roughly divided into Internet companies, large state-owned enterprises and foreign companies. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Internet technology companies have always shown people with a low-carbon and avant-garde image, but data centers as important infrastructure of the Internet are also large energy consumption households, reducing data center carbon emissions the most carbon emissions The effective way is to use green electricity. This also makes Alibaba Cloud, Tencent, Qinhuai Data and Irson data become big buyers of Green Electric. In 2022, Alibaba&#39;s green electricity trading volume reached 860 million kilowatt -hours, Tencent reached 504 million kWh, and the top five of the two -dual -dual -dual entered corporate green power procurement list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; However, even if it is an Internet header company, the proportion of green electricity uses the entire power consumption is not high. In 2020, the use of data renewable energy in 1020 was 22.6%, and the number increased to 34.3%in 2021. During the fiscal year of 2022, 21.6%of Alibaba Cloud&#39;s electric power came from clean energy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Compared with Internet companies, the traditional carbon vurate-the green power transaction of steel companies is even more urgent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Green Electric trading practitioners believe that large steel companies are often local leading enterprises, and they have always been the main object of environmental supervision. Take the lead. Compared to the improvement process, using green electricity is easier and more effective to reduce emission reduction measures. In addition, in recent years, the price of coal is high, the price of thermal power is floating, and the green power seems to be &quot;not so expensive.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; More importantly, the force of the high-precision technology developed by steel enterprises to be sold to foreign companies or exports to overseas, facing Make the harsh requirements of carbon footprints. For example, in March 2022, Heteel Group purchased 270 million kilowatt -hours of green electricity at the Jibei Electric Power Trading Center, partly because He steel and one of the main customers, BMW, BMW By using green electricity, He steel provides BMW to provide lower -intensity steel with lower carbon footprints. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Foreign companies favors green electricity, and they have chosen to sign the long-term and long-term agreement of green electricity, which is not high enough with domestic green certificates, which is not high enough internationally, and more convenient green power transactions. related. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Taking the German-funded enterprise Brilliance BMW as an example, it purchased 2.78 billion kilowatt-hours of green power in 2021.

Guo Yan, manager of the BMW business development and the company&#39;s sustainable development department, said that the company&#39;s purchase and use of Green Electric must be summarized into the non -financial statements of the BMW Group in Germany, and passed through the Pwi -Pacific Road (China) and Pricewater Yong Dao (Germany) audit to ensure that the EU&#39;s control of carbon emissions on car companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The EU&#39;s green power transaction is very different from China.

Pay attention to the carbon footprint of the product and require the supply chain partners to join in.

The amount, using green power to become an extra points for the export of the enterprise. &quot;Green power is premium than thermal power. From the cost, we judge how much a proportion of green electricity to buy. It mainly depends on how much electricity is needed to manufacture export products. Song Yu, Align: LEFT; &quot;>; Vision Energy and Environmental Products, also told the south weekend that their customers are mainly export -oriented enterprises in the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta.&quot; Buying green electricity is mainly to meet the requirements of foreign customers. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; However, more domestic small and medium-sized enterprises have not yet &quot;prioritized&quot; green electricity. &quot;Whether it is the total energy consumption control or the weight of the responsibility of renewable energy, these policies are issued by various ministries and commissions to local governments, not directly targeting electricity companies.&quot; This also allows small and medium -sized enterprises to buy green electricity. Endogenous motivation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The best way to stimulate the power is to discover the needs of the company. For example, many small and medium -sized enterprises are concerned about whether the procurement of green electricity can give the priority of power consumption or performed exemptions in a special period. From 2021 to 2022, there are many provinces in China, tight electricity consumption and even power limit. Some enterprises consult Song Yu if they can buy green electricity priority to ensure electricity consumption. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Four Yunnan companies that have purchased Green Electric also said to the south weekend that Yunnan, mainly hydropower, will enter power and tension every autumn and winter. In the state, enterprises need to concessions for residents. They did not hear that buying green electricity can not be limited. This shows that although the state and the localities encourage enterprises to participate in green power transactions, there is still a gap between the incentives and the expectations of enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Southern weekend discovered that Qinghai Province&#39;s &quot;2023 Electricity Trading Plan&quot; stipulates that users who participate in green power transactions in the province will appropriately relax the exemption of bias electricity.

Li Wei, an expert in the power system, has participated in the system design of the green certificate. She said to the southern weekend that green electricity transactions were limited by space and physical restrictions, and it was difficult for enterprises in the southeast region to be relatively lacking to obtain power priority by buying green electricity. &quot;For example, Zhejiang, the amount of green electricity that can be adjusted from foreign provinces every day is limited, such as 100 million degrees, and then Zhejiang&#39;s province can send 100 million degrees of green electricity, then there will be only 200 million degrees of green electricity in the market. , While buying it. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p style =&quot; text-align: left; &quot;>; &lt;br>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img img-id =&quot; 74034 &quot;group-id =&quot; 0 &quot; Asset-id = &quot;70833&quot; src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/cbac554b2d.jpg&quot; img-tital = &quot;August 21, 2023, photovoltaic board Neatly arranged in the national renewable energy demonstration zone located in Zhangjiakou, Hebei.

In the provincial -level energy consumption authority, when completing the requirements of dual -control assessment of the energy consumption, in fact, in accordance with the principle of &quot;grasping the big and small&quot;, the task index is decomposed to some key energy -consuming enterprises, but the &quot;open side of the net to the SME&quot; network opens the Internet &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In addition, Zheng Ying learned from some companies that many companies have not been punished even if the government&#39;s dual-control requirements have not completed the government&#39;s energy consumption dual control requirements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; This may be because under the pressure of economic downturn, local governments must consider not only the company&#39;s ability to bear punishment measures, but also the negative impact on investment promotion. Under the requirements of energy consumption dual control, it is not known to how much the willingness to purchase green certificates and green electricity to increase. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;I think, when the time is mature, it is still necessary The degree of improvement may still be limited. After all, in the current stage of the development of the green certificate market, if you want to increase the willingness and motivation of the enterprise to buy a large scale, you still need a stronger policy guidance and constraints, instead of relying on enterprises to buy them voluntarily. &quot; Zheng Ying analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The good news is that the &quot;Fourteenth Five-Year Plan&quot; plan has been proposed to gradually change the energy consumption dual-control to the dual-control of carbon emissions. At that time, enterprises can achieve carbon emissions through the case of insufficient carbon indicators to achieve the standard of carbon emissions. Before this transition, the energy consumption dual control system improves its assessment index allocation and reward and punishment mechanism to lay the foundation for the debut of the dual control of carbon emissions is the meaning of the title. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; The linkage between green electricity, green syndrome and carbon market is imminent &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; It will undoubtedly greatly enhance the motivation to buy green electricity. &quot;Many of our customers are concerned about whether the green certificate he bought can be used in carbon transactions in the future to deduct a part of the carbon row.&quot; Said the person in charge of a Tianjin electricity sales company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In fact, green power is the participants who can be measured and verified the most accurate measurement and verification in carbon transactions. The accurate carbon reduction measurement method is naturally connected with the carbon trading system represented by CCER. However, the &quot;electric carbon linkage&quot; looks like water is successful, but it is difficult to make it difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In August 2023, three ministries and commissions such as the National Development and Reform Commission jointly issued the &quot;Notice on the full coverage of the green power certificate of renewable energy,&quot; &quot;(Hereinafter referred to as&quot; Notice &quot;), emphasizing the connection between the green certificate and the carbon market. On October 24th, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment formulated and released 4 voluntary emissions of greenhouse gas emission reduction projects. The grid -ranging thermal power generation and grid -connected sea wind power generation were clear. The mechanism does not exist in the case of repeated identification or emission reduction and repetition calculation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In this case, the environmental attributes of the power generation of related renewable energy projects have attributed to green certificates or CCER, which has attracted much attention from the industry. Zheng Ying said that the &quot;Notice&quot; clearly states that the green certificate is the only proof of my country&#39;s renewable energy and electricity and the environmental attributes, and it is the only proof that determines the production and consumption of renewable energy power and consumption. If the environmental attributes of renewable energy can be identified by green and CCER at the same time, it will cause environmental attributes to be repeatedly developed and calculated in the two mechanisms. &quot;The worst result is that the green certificate and CCER recognize the restrictions at the same time.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; At present, Apple, Google, TSMC, Coca-Cola and other more than 300 Family well -known international enterprises have joined the RE100 initiative. Many domestic export -oriented companies need to be certified by RE100, but Li Wei introduced that RE100 is not completely recognized by domestic green certificates It is Re100 that &quot;after the issuance of the Chinese green certificate, the environmental rights and interests should be followed according to the green certificate, but some power generation projects have received the environmental voucher issued by CCER at the same time, which has a double measurement and dual benefit. Electric power companies are used. It is forced to prove itself. For example, the power field it bought, the part of the electric field, has no longer applying for other environmental vouchers except the green certificate. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; On October 18, 2023, the notice of the &quot;notice of 2023-2025 in 2023-2025 &quot;It is mentioned that&quot; enterprises that use non -alpoped energy power through market -oriented trading need to report this part of the electricity consumption separately and provide relevant certification materials. &quot;It is stipulated that the proof materials do not include green power certificates. The document also stipulates that the emission volume corresponding to the non -chemical energy power purchased by the enterprise is temporarily calculated according to the average carbon emission factor of the national power grid, which means that the green power purchased by the enterprise does not work for the time being in the carbon emissions accounting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;br>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img img-id = &quot;74035&quot; group-id = &quot;0&quot; asset-id = &quot;70834&quot; &quot;&quot; src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/08305028c4.png&quot; IMG- TITLE = &quot;October 18, 2023, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment announced the&quot; Taking 2023 &quot; —From 2025, the notice of some key industries corporate greenhouse gas emissions reports and verification work &quot;.png&quot; alt = &quot;&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot;1080&quot; height = &quot;749&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/08305028c4.png&quot; data-key=&quot;260832&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center; &quot;>; On October 18, 2023, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment announced the&quot; Notice on Doing a Notice on the Report and Checking Report and Checking Report of Parts of the Enterprise Enterprises in 2023-2025 &quot; STYLE = &quot;Text-Align: left;&quot;>; Zheng Ying believes that to solve the problem of synergy, we must first clarify what the environmental attributes of renewable energy power are. &quot;If the green certificate represents zero emissions, when the power represents the power representative in the future, the power representation can be calculated directly according to zero emissions; if it is calculated as a reduction, its application method in carbon emissions accounts is not as CCER in the CCer. The difference is that CCER is also reduced displacement. The only difference is that in order to prevent drifting, the reduction of the discharge of the green syndrome can only be used to reduce the power emissions of outsourcing in the range 2. Reduce displacement. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p style =&quot; text-align: left; &quot;>; After clarifying the environmental attributes of green electricity, the problem of duplicate calculation needs to be solved. The first is to calculate the power of the power represented by the green certificate when calculating the power grid emissions factor; the second is that the consumption side is purchased or does not purchase the green certificate. carbon emission. How to improve the power grid emissions factors to ensure that the environmental attributes of the green certificate will not be reused or calculated on the power generation side or the consumer side. &quot;The core of the whole thing will eventually point to the construction of China&#39;s power grid emissions factor system, and whether the data of the two markets of green and CCER can be shared.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot; >; Li Wei thinks that the best way is to enable the value of green syndrome in the carbon emission reduction can be directly applied to the carbon market. For example, it is likely to be included in the CCER offshore wind power project. If the Ministry of Ecology and Environment recognizes the carbon emission reduction value represented by the green certificate, the carbon reduction displacement represented by the green certificate of the offshore wind power project can directly enter the CCER market without having to do it without having to do it. The offshore wind power project will issue a CCER certificate and give it another environmental rights to avoid repeated calculations. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; Increase the scale of green power transactions across the province &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; It is necessary to point out that, although the current cross-regional power market trading platform has been established, However, in the medium- and long -term power direct trading market, direct transactions in the province are still the main province. A Pwa&#39;s report pointed out that the proportion of direct transactions between provinces accounted for only 2%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; This status quo is also one of the important reasons for the green power &quot;campaign&quot; existing in the western region with rich landscape resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; According to the support of the &quot;Capital Green Electric Power Trading Policy and Suggestion Report&quot; by the support of the capital of Beijing, the Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Eastern provinces Both their willingness to sell green power to the outside world is not strong, making the capital Beijing and the provinces and cities signing green electricity facing many difficulties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The province of green electricity &quot;campaign&quot; is to give priority to ensure the completion of the province&#39;s renewable energy power consumption task. &quot;Another reason is that because of the cheap electricity price and rich energy of the western region, the western region will attract a certain amount of high energy -consuming enterprises to invest in local production and invest in local green power consumption growth.&quot; Zheng Ying said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; According to the above report, at present, cross-provincial and cross-regional green power transactions are mainly carried out through the transaction method of &quot;network&quot; and &quot;point-to-network&quot;. &quot;The transaction method broke the control of the power grid company to the 13th channel of cross -regional electricity in the province, but at present, the state has not clearly explicitly explicitly implement the specific implementation rules of the&quot; point -to -point &quot;transaction. &quot;Cross -provincial and regional green power transactions, the market is insufficient. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; For provinces and regions relying on external power adjustment, we need to comprehensively consider the characteristics of their own location to seek a diverse energy insurance supply solution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Zhou Feng, director of the clean power project of the Energy Foundation, pointed out that a typical southeast coastal province represented by Zhejiang can not only deploy new high-voltage channels, but also It can strengthen cooperation with the development of renewable energy and the upstream and downstream of the new energy industry chain between government and provincial enterprises between provinces and provincial enterprises. For example, Zhejiang Tianneng Group reached a cooperation with Gansu Province Baiyedon Color Group and Golden Silk Road Fund to jointly promote the construction of a new energy industry ecosystem in Zhejiang and Gansu provinces. It is dedicated to the development and construction of the development and construction of low -carbon energy projects; the other is Beijing, on the one hand, it depends on external adjustment, but on the other hand, it is in the range of Beijing -Tianjin -Hebei regional power grids, which means that the scale of its external power adjustment depends on Beijing In order to complete the &quot;Fourteen Five -Year Plan&quot; green power target, the establishment of the &quot;14th Five -Year Plan&quot; should promote green transactions and promote green power growth from the two levels of the domain (Beijing -Tianjin -Hebei). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; To maximize the value of green electricity transactions between different provinces, the relevant mechanism of the power market may play a key role. The report &quot;China Construction of the National Unified Electric Power Market System&quot; jointly released by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Energy Foundation shows that regional transactions can promote the sharing of resources within a larger scale, so it can bring system toughness and help to improve the systemic toughness and help help Investment in reducing the need to reducing the installation. The report pointed out that compared with the coordination of the provincial province, building a national market can reduce operating costs by 6%-12%and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 2%-10%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 19:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[恐龙灭绝的新细节]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261958]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-12-06 18:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; In 66 million years ago, the Baiji-Gurin-Jining Biostatic Extinction, including non-bird dinosaur Within, about three -quarters of the species on the earth are extinct. Since the asteroid impact in the 1980s, scientists have successively discovered evidence that evidence can prove the cause of this extinction, especially the discovery of the Hick Suruberry Pit on the Yicatan Peninsula in Mexico, which provides a reference for further research on the impact and extinction process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;66 million years ago, asteroid hit the Mexican Yicatan Peninsula, a fire ball with a diameter of 10 to 15 kilometers hit a 180 -kilometer wide large at a speed of nearly 20 kilometers per second.

The 180 -kilometer wide pit released huge energy and gave a fatal blow to the dinosaurs that ruled the earth at the time. &amp; nbsp; &lt;span>; Visual China | Figure &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the basic process of great extinction, the scientific community generally believes that the material generated by the Hick Suruber was sprayed to the atmosphere, which led to the global climate Sudden changes and abnormally decreased temperatures, so that a large number of creatures cannot survive. But what material participation has promoted the sudden changes in the climate and the specific details, these problems are still controversial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Recently, researchers from the Royal Observatory of Belgium, the University of Brussels Liberty and other institutions simulated the changes in the climate by analyzing the sedimentary data, thinking that silicate dust plays an important role in triggering this crisis. The size of these particles is 0.8 to 8 microns, forming a huge dust cloud group into a flat flow layer, and then spreads the world to cover the sky and obstruct the effective radiation of photosynthesis for a long time. The cooling effect of sulfur -containing gases such as sulfur -containing gases and high fires after the impact may cause the disaster of the great extinction of this creature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Our research clearly states that the impact of sulfur and smoke may have been overvalued before, and the impact of fine dust may be underestimated.&quot; Philip Kyk, a professor at the University of Liberty, who participated in this research, Philippe Claeys told the southern weekend reporter, &quot;We strongly advocate the latter is the main reason for extinction.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Because the simulation data shows that the amount of silicic acid dust is the largest after the impact, and these are these Dust and smoke can be suspended in the atmosphere for 15 years. In comparison, although sulfur -containing gases can also cover the sun and make the temperature of the earth cold, its settlement speed is fast, and it only stays in the atmosphere for nearly 8 years. From this comprehensive, after the impact of Hick Suruber, it may affect the climate at the time by interference in the atmosphere for 15 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Related research was published in Nature Geoscience in November 2023. These impacts may include the global average surface temperature decreased by as much as 25 degrees Celsius, creating endless &quot;cold winter&quot;, and if the temperature wants to recover as early, it may take nearly 20 years. What is even more fatal is that due to the influence of a large amount of dust, the recovery of photosynthesis also takes about two years. During this period, the cold and cold environment will cause food deficiency, and species that cannot adapt to this environment for a long time may be extinct. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Many of the latest studies have also been confirmed by paleontological evidence. For example, research shows that the photosynthetic effect is first recovered in the summer of the southern hemisphere. Consistent. However, in the future, it is still necessary to study the records of related strata in different places around the world to better understand the differences and recovery of the extinction and recovery of various regions, so as to better confirm the impact of this extinction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The sedimentary samples analyzed in the current research are originally from the fossil site of Tanis, North Dakota, and belong to the White-Cycles-Ancient Merchants Line of the Land. Three thousand kilometers. 66 million years ago, when the asteroid hits the position of the Yicatan Peninsula, a fireball of 10 to 15 kilometers in diameter is at a speed of nearly 20 kilometers per second at the ground. At the same time, the melted sphere and mineral debris shot out of the pit like an artillery shell, falling in the distance, and then deposited in the rock layer with the dust, smoke and other substances that settle down, and became a testimony of this incident. &amp; nbsp; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 1980, Professor LUIS W. Alvarez, Professor of the University of California, who had won the Nobel Prize in Physics, has already won the Nobel Prize in Physics. Alvarez and others found that among some deep-sea limestals in Italy, Denmark, New Zealand and other places, the accuracy of the background base before the Baiji-Gujinji creatures is abnormally more than dozens or even hundreds of times before the Great Kondi Biostatic. It is speculated that these crickets do not come from the crust, but aliens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Walter Alvarez was an associate professor at the Department of Geology and Earth Physics at the University of California, Berkeley. They together published an article in Science and proposed that asteroids hit the earth and caused the White-Clear-Ancients Premature hypothesis of Disciplinary Biostatic. According to the analysis at the time, after a huge little asteroid hit the earth, it would inject 60 times the rocks of its own quality into the atmosphere in the form of powder, and then floated along the flat stratum to the world to suppress the photosynthesis and cause biological extinction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The latest research further proves the explanation of dust around the dust, and negates the more critical statement about the dangers of sulfur. Felip Chrys, who participated in the latest research, is also a geologist, planetary scientist, and celestial chemist. He is now a professor at archeology, environmental change, and Earth Chemistry Research Center of the University of Liberty of Brussels. Walter Alvarez cooperated to conduct research in this field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is worth noting that in September 2022, researchers at Datmouth College, Princeton University and other institutions analyzed the data of the fire into the province of Rock Provincial and Potential Bio, and believed The main driving factor of great extinction. The reason is that from the perspective of the geological timeline, the emergence of the fire in the province of fire has a clear correlation with the time interval between the animals that appear to be replaced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This study was published in the &quot;Academy of Sciences&quot; (PNAS). The fire of the fire is a large -scale volcanic eruption, which usually includes more than 100,000 cubic kilometers of magma. Wherever it goes, hundreds of thousands of or even millions of square kilometers of magma can be formed. A large amount of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and other substances can be released. Researchers from Dartmouth College and other institutions believe that the two are not accidental at the same time. It may be a causal relationship, but it is not enough to determine the causal relationship with a certain extermination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Each extinction is a complex and different process, and it cannot be attributed to a single reason, such as large volcanic incidents. Because similar or almost similar time is not enough to prove that the volcanic effect is caused by extinction. An excessive simplified way. To find the culprit, the culprit requires excellent detective work. &quot;Philip Chrys explained to the southern weekend reporter that&quot; 66 million years ago, the impact of a large meteorite on the Yicatan Peninsula caused dinosaurs With most of the extinction of land and marine biospheres, scientists have a wide consensus on this. We have only studied the Baiji Period-Ancient Broker Line of 66 million years ago. Back is the cause of extinction, but we cannot explain other big extinction events accordingly. The collapse of these large biospheres is likely to be much more complicated than some people think. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 18:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[10万亿级中信集团迎来新任掌舵者]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261996]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-12-06 17:42:27 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; According to the official website of CITIC Group, on the morning of December 6, China CITIC Group Co., Ltd. held a cadre meeting. .

Consumers are gradually reluctant to pay, and the giants may not be too good in the future. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;值得注意的是，除了竞争愈发激烈以外，辣条也饱受“不健康零食”的诟病。辣条的标签离不开“高油、高盐、高糖”，持续大量的摄入，会增加肥胖、高血压等代谢性疾病风险。 &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而且市面上的辣条品类良莠不齐，存在由“三无”小作坊非法生产的，截至2022年4月8日，某辣条品牌的投诉量有600多条，主要有吃出异物、过期变质等问题。 &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在此背景下，平江通过支持休闲食品企业提质扩能“二次创业”，打造优质“土特产”，唱响以特色产业富民强县的“振兴曲” . &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而对于辣条行业的其它后来者而言，应该提前拥抱趋势，做好辣条健康、品质和正宗等课题，才能在市场站稳脚跟，不被年轻消费者disuse. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;今天，“知道”就带你围观“辣条崛起之城”的前世今生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/bcb1cc40d26b3257fc405b33e35bf1b2.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;853&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/bcb1cc40d26b3257fc405b33e35bf1b2.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260865&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/94561c277485394ddc8601468d7cca9c.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1439&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/94561c277485394ddc8601468d7cca9c.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260866&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/51ce5f0a64391e9b1945ae6aafeb927c.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/51ce5f0a64391e9b1945ae6aafeb927c.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260867&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/3bf049261c1eef96c50519e9e1e5eb1b.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1439&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/3bf049261c1eef96c50519e9e1e5eb1b.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260869&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/30f0b099f06887f14ae6be5a27bf45fc.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1439&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/30f0b099f06887f14ae6be5a27bf45fc.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260870&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/d629ac1f39568f0600f51b604a180bd1.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/d629ac1f39568f0600f51b604a180bd1.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260871&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/0009f09a958d8d206dfa0daf58b6766e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1439&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/0009f09a958d8d206dfa0daf58b6766e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260873&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 17:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[流浪狗直播间造假：卖惨、带货、拉黑]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261960]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-06 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;在直播平台，一些流浪狗直播间号称收养了数十只流浪狗，通过卖惨，引导网友捐献爱心。（视觉中国图）&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/4985ff428c.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/4985ff428c.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260884&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: left;&quot;>;在直播平台，一些流浪狗直播间号称收养了数十只流浪狗，通过卖惨，引导网友献爱心。 （视觉中国图）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;十几张塑料小床摆在一起，地面被挤得几乎没有缝隙，狭窄的空间里，约三十只狗窝成一堆。它们毛发脏乱，异常瘦弱，大都昏昏欲睡，偶尔才动弹一下，舔舔身上的毛。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一段煽情的音乐正在循环播放，配上一段录好的音频，声称这些都是主播救助来的流浪狗，希望爱心人士能点击购买直播间购物车里的狗粮，为它们献上爱心。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;主播并未出镜，只反复在评论区刷出两条信息：“地址随便写，商家会改地址给我们寄过来的”“谢谢各位好心人对毛孩子的关心，狗粮是发到基地的，地址随便写就可以了，商家会统一发到基地”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在短视频平台，这样的流浪狗直播间并不少见。南方周末记者随机进入几个直播间，发现观看人数由个位数到千位数不等，其中最多的一间约有3500人正在同时观看，该场直播已获得19.4万次点赞。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但并非所有流浪狗直播间都是真实可信的。 11月初，有网友发帖，提醒大家别被这类直播间欺骗。网友称，自己在一个流浪狗救助直播中下单了狗粮后，要求主播摸摸镜头中某只小狗，随即被拉黑。这一网帖登上社交平台热榜，引发大量关注。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在几个流浪狗直播间里，南方周末记者尝试留言，询问如何确保狗粮送达、基地具体地址、是否会公开明细等，问题或直接被忽略，或得到含糊回答.一位主播回复基地位置在“射阳县环洋村”，但进一步追问具体地址后，主播不再回应。接连提出几个问题后，南方周末记者被该直播间拉黑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随后，南方周末记者联系到该主播声称地址的居委会，工作人员表示所谓的环洋村如今并不存在，已被合并。 After visiting the grid staff, the staff member confirmed to the reporter from the south weekend, &quot;There is no stray dog ​​rescue station on our side. The so -called base, we have not.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了救助站真假存疑，还有人嗅到了直播以外的更多商机。网络上出现了大批教学文章，组织培训群，号称可以教人打造流浪狗直播，“一年赚了800万”。南方周末记者找到一位声称一日打赏超过10万元的教学者，询问运营成本，对方回复，“主要看场景，（包括）狗、粮食、房租水电”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这位教学者还提醒并建议道：“现在这个玩法的风口已经过了，以前流量很大的，现在直播间不太好起流，我不建议你再去玩这个东西了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;直播间里的流浪狗大多数时候都挤在一起睡觉，不叫不闹，在动物救助机构负责人陈嫱看来，狗在密集空间中长时间保持这样的状态，不符合常理。（南方周末记者翁榕榕截图）&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/6660de4856.jpg&quot;

text-align: left;&quot;>;直播间里的流浪狗大多数时候都挤在一起睡觉，不叫不闹，在动物救助机构负责人陈嫱看来，狗在密集空间中长时间保持这样的状态，不符合常理。 （南方周末记者翁榕榕截图）&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;卖惨的尽头是带货&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2022年起，辛朝朝常刷到流浪狗直播间，镜头中，大部分流浪狗都挤在一个狭小的房间，看起来无精打采。有些狗身上挂着牌子，写着诸如“请投喂”“我们已经饿了很久了”等字样。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;直播内容大多单调，不会介绍狗的具体情况，只是反复卖惨。辛朝朝心疼这些瘦弱的流浪狗，毫不犹豫地按主播的提示下单了狗粮。一份狗粮大约十元，价格不高，她每次买两三份，只当作随手的小善举。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后来，辛朝朝去过一家线下的流浪狗救助基地，她发现工作人员非常了解每只狗的身世，而且大部分狗很有生机活力，和直播间里完全不同。她试着在直播间发表评论，询问主播自己是否可以领养或去做义工，这些留言总被主播无视。她意识到不对劲。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李雪曾被某个流浪狗直播间拉黑，她现在在一家线下流浪狗基地做志愿者。那时晚上失眠，她会打开直播间刷一会儿，看小狗睡觉。看多了之后，她发现很多直播账号虽然显示在不同的城市，但房间的布局、装饰、狗的状态等，模式几乎一模一样。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有一次，她看到一个流浪狗直播间显示和自己位于同一个城市，于是在直播间留言，说自己有救助经验，询问能否过去帮忙。这位主播此前反复强调自己缺粮、缺人。李雪留言了几次，主播并未回应，后来将她拉黑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;广州阿派关爱小动物社会发展中心成立了七年，专门从事流浪动物救助，负责人陈嫱也刷到过类似的流浪狗直播间。根据她的经验，真正的动物救助会让动物出来走动、晒太阳，但直播间里的狗通常只是在睡觉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她认为，如果动物密集度过高，会很难长时间处于安稳入睡的状态，而且狗有领地和空间意识，过于集中容易引发撕咬。 “在一个拥挤的空间，二十多只全部挤在一块儿睡觉，好像还相亲相爱，比较违背我们的认知。”陈嫱告诉南方周末记者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;至于让观众购买狗粮寄往基地的操作，陈嫱认为也很可疑，拍下的商品可能不会真正寄出，交易并没有真实发生，“我们是不知道的，只知道钱已经付了”。李雪也认为，“仅仅是个名义，发不发货不知道”。她还观察到，一些新直播间不会一上来就挂出购物链接，而是“先假装无欲无求两天”，再开始带货。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了狗粮之外，这些流浪狗直播账号还会兜售宠物商品或普通日用品，引导观众点入链接购买。陈嫱发现，很多商品来源不明，“产品从哪里来的，是不是去过这个品牌或厂里里进行了评估，我们看不到”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者点进某个购买链接，商品名称是“救助站（专用全犬粮）”，有八种规格可选，价格从30元至1000元不等，已售93件。但查看该链接所在店铺，营业执照显示经营者是一家文具店，个体工商户，注册日期为2020年。该店铺有四款狗粮在售，销量最高的链接上架于10月20日，已售出383份。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;该店铺客服告诉南方周末记者，狗粮由仓库生产，直接发往基地，随后将南方周末记者拉入黑名单。另两家狗粮店铺则称，与主播有合作，主播为厂家进行宣传，或是收取带货佣金。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;某流浪狗直播账号的橱窗购物链接。（南方周末记者翁榕榕截图）&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/3aa4984be1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot;

&lt;h4>;自编自导的救助剧本&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;这类账号除了进行直播，还会拍摄救助流浪狗的视频。李雪曾看过一个救助视频，主播声称救助了一只受伤小狗，它伤得很重，甚至露出了骨头。每隔一段时间，主播会更新它康复的状态。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李雪将视频发到自己所在的救助群中，有位兽医告诉她，按照视频里一开始的惨状，不可能恢复到如今这个状态，除非是医学奇迹。李雪猜想，账号主人可能就是虐狗者本人，他在自导自演，视频其实是倒叙更新。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李雪曾见过有主播在狗肉摊边拍摄，声称已经买下这些狗，号召大家捐款。她觉得这有悖常理，“以动物救助的身份，跑到屠宰狗的地方去拍摄，我觉得正常情况下都不会这样让你拍出来的”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年1月，据媒体报道，江苏省淮安市盱眙县的流浪狗主播马长春疑似偷狗，并利用流浪狗直播骗取打赏。数据显示，他的粉丝量超过151万，180天内直播总收入高达1622.8万元。该主播一同乡称，马长春曾到自己的基地买狗进行直播，狗生病了就直接卖掉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;蔓云是第一批揭发此事的博主之一，此前也给一些直播间捐过钱。当时抖音上陆续有人质疑马长春造假，列举的证据包括：他的小号发的视频带上了“肉狗养殖”的标签，他家的小院里有捕狗网兜等。蔓云将这些信息综合起来，发布在自己的账号上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由于蔓云的账号流量大，越来越多网友找到她提供线索。有人称，马长春直播间里的某只流浪狗正是自己之前丢失的狗，评论和私信索要却被无视；网友询问马长春是否卖狗，他曾给出肯定回答；某位爱心人士捐赠了250斤大米和60斤三文鱼碎肉，马却依然表示狗狗吃不饱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;之后，蔓云和一些爱心人士报了警。事后，当地警方称已经去实地调查过，目前狗来源没有问题，也暂未发现有相关违法行为。不久后，马长春的账号被平台封禁下架，这位百万级主播消失在互联网世界。从此以后，真伪难辨的流浪狗直播间在人们心中埋下疑虑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位流浪狗直播间教学者告诉南方周末记者，要打造这类账号，首先“得有养狗的场地，有狗，狗粮”。他总结，找场地很简单，废旧厂房或自搭简易大棚都可以，狗可以收养或从狗市买廉价狗，“也可以与别的狗场合作，哪种能吸引观众就找哪种，比如狗可爱、有特点、战斗力强或者可怜、博同情”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他提到，如果想显得惨一点，“除非（自己）收养流浪狗”。他还建议，“没有必要一次性那么多只，如果你有几只流浪狗，每只都起个名字，然后都有自己的特点和故事，不比七十多只好吗？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“这个社会上如果想搞这么一堆狗的话，实在是太容易了。”辛朝朝推测，有些直播间里的狗可能是“农村里人家不要的狗，或者是被偷走的，或者是繁殖场里低价处理掉的狗，或者是宠物市场里面的”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在救助基地做志愿活动时，李雪得知，有些流浪狗直播间没有自己的狗场，而是临时租来的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;是否支持线下领养、救助有无后续？ &lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;阿派关爱小动物社会发展中心目前大约有八十只动物，几乎都是爱心人士偶遇后通知中心过去救助的。陈嫱告诉南方周末记者，最多时一天会收到七八十个流浪动物救助信息，“有时候根本救不过来”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大多数流浪动物都有重伤重病，除了治疗外，中心还要定期为动物洗澡、驱虫等，目的是为了让它们能被顺利地领养。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“任何真正帮助流浪动物的基地都愿意动物被领养，因为只有这样才能够腾出更多的资源去接收新的动物。”据陈嫱观察，很多流浪狗直播间不会正面回应观众领养的愿望，也不愿让人知道它的详细地址从而去实地考察。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者发现，有些流浪狗直播间虽然在主页中声称允许领养，但条件却与金钱挂钩。比如某直播间号称有一百多只狗，只要在直播间坚持“云养”三个月，便可以领养一只回家。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所谓的“云养”，就是“在它们日常饭食的基础上可以给它们加肉肉”，即捐款。该主播表示，“如果连三个月的坚持都做不到的话，不要跟我说你有多喜欢它们，即使带回去也不一定能比我这过得好”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陈嫱认为，云养听起来“像是捆绑销售”。广州另一家动物救助中心的负责人告诉南方周末记者，一般的动物领养看重领养人的养宠观念及责任心，在沟通过程中便有大概的了解。动物被领养后，他们会在前两年做一些回访工作，了解动物的生活状态，如果没问题，之后不会再去打扰。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在李雪看来，是否支持线下公开领养也是辨别真假直播间的方式之一。如果对方愿意公开地址并接受领养，最好还要去主页看对方是否一直在卖惨，“正规的救助更想把这个狗领养出去，更偏向拍那些狗很活泼积极的一面”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;目前，阿派关爱小动物社会发展中心每月的支出在七八万元。作为一家合法注册的公益组织，他们80%的经费来源依靠公众募捐，其中一个渠道就是通过公募平台发起募捐项目。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者发现，很多流浪狗直播间也带有公募链接，点进链接，项目信息显示经过了民政局备案，但项目的内容介绍与直播间里提及的情况并incompatible.除此之外，李雪认为，救助有无后续也是辨别方式之一，正规的救助通常会更新后续情况，包括钱款的用途明细也会公开。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“毕竟是隔着屏幕的东西，与其去辨别网络上的真假，不如去了解当地真实的东西，你所能够看到的才是真实的。网上这种你再怎么去辨别，也不能百分之百地确定。”辛朝朝对南方周末记者说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;自从马长春事件后，蔓云已经很久不看流浪狗直播间了，“因为被欺骗了，我真的很伤心，他们怎么可以这么利用大家呢？我不再看了&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现在，蔓云主要在现实中做救助，遇到流浪的动物会给它们喂食。她救助过两条流浪狗，朋友最终领养了它们，她自己也养着一条朋友捡到的流浪狗。 “我感觉辨别这种好累，就干脆在现实当中吧，身边比较重要，网上都是见不到的。”蔓云说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为救助机构的负责人，陈嫱感到纠结，“有时候很希望能够把不是真正做公益的情况告诉公众，但是有时候又怕公众没有分辨能力，会误解很多真正（救助）的机构。反正分不清楚，就说你们都是骗子，真的很矛盾。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“很无奈，没有办法，你的善心很有可能就是造成它们流浪的原因。”李雪说，“在没有办法甄别的情况下，做好身边的救助就已经很棒了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（应受访者要求，李雪、辛朝朝、蔓云为化名）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;最近一段时间，呼吸道传染病再次暴发。这个时候健康码重出江湖，让很多人不禁浮想联翩。不过也有网友说，这只是因为一些地方的健康码系统没有下线，一直都在，并不是近期才“重出江湖”，不用杞人忧天。有地方的官方市民热线在回应相关问题时表示，只要没有对生活和出行产生影响，就“没事”，意思是不用去管它&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;，“（疫情）已经过去了。”&lt;/span>;但健康码事关重大，相关部门还是有必要进一步作出解释，消除公众疑虑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;新冠“乙类乙管”后，健康码何去何从曾经引起广泛的讨论。很多地方宣布将下线健康码系统并删除数据。如2023年2月14日，某省相关部门曾发布公告宣布，自2023年2月16日11时起关闭抗原自测老幼助查、健康申报、数字空间、防疫工作台等服务入口，彻底删除、销毁服务相关所有数据，切实保障个人信息安全。虽然当时的公告并没有提及要彻底下线健康码小程序并删除所有的数据，但公众普遍认为，健康码已经完成了历史使命，其应该彻底退出历史舞台，并销毁整个系统背后的所有数据. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;毫无疑问，健康码系统储存了大量的个人信息。姓名、身份证号、手机号码，甚至人脸认证等信息，都属于极度敏感的个人信息。而健康码系统中还可能保存了每个人何时到过哪里等行程信息，是否打过疫苗等医疗健康信息，这些信息同样是个人的隐私。在疫情期间，为了防控需要，公众可以理解、接受和支持。而在疫情结束后，相关系统已经没有任何理由继续保存这些用户的隐私数据，理应销毁。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;当时，工信部信息通信经济专家委员会委员、中国行为法学会网络与数据法学研究部主任王春晖接受媒体采访也表示，行程卡、健康码使命已结束，处理个人信息的目的不再必要，应当依法全部删除。很多地方也都宣布将销毁健康码系统的个人数据，有些城市还举行了公开的销毁仪式。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;但从目前的情况来看，还有很多地方的健康码系统似乎还没有下线，一些地方还保留了至少一部分数据。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;长期保存这些数据，甚至健康码系统也没有完全下线，数据泄露的风险将急剧增加。因为疫情过后，健康码系统的技术维护基本上就停滞了，如果数据没有销毁，系统没有下线，一直暴露在互联网上，很可能会遭到黑客的攻击，如果数据泄露，后果不堪设想。甚至在健康码系统还在运行的时候，疑似某地健康码系统4850万用户的信息就曾出现在暗网上被叫卖。而调查人员对售卖者公布的47组数据进行核对发现，这些用户的姓名、身份证号、手机号都属实，而他们也确实注册了这一城市的健康码应用。这些泄露的数据，将会永久存在于暗网上，不断被卖来卖去。手机号可以换，但是姓名和身份证号却是要用一辈子的，不知道什么时候，这些信息就可能被用来对其进行电信诈骗。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;健康码系统是由各地独立开发的，停用之后的处理也由各地自行负责。有些地方宣布要停止服务、销毁数据，但是从目前爆出的情况来看，有些地方实际上并没有做到位。当然也有很多地方的健康码应用确实已经停止服务了，小程序已经无法使用。但其背后的数据是否已经销毁，用户也无从得知。有必要由权威的第三方对各地健康码系统的停用和数据销毁情况进行监督和核查，确保这些存储着海量用户敏感信息的数据都被彻底销毁，不会被泄露，或者在用户不知情的情况下用于其他用途。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;不管健康码是“重出江湖”还是“从未下线”，都显示一些地方还保留了至少一部分数据。这些地方有必要对此作出官方的澄清，并尽快在有监督的情况下下线健康码程序，销毁数据，以消除公众的疑虑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;/p>;

data-key=&quot;260881&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;12月3日下午，康特接受南方周末记者的面对面专访。 （图/南方周末记者吕慧乾）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“中国和印度正在同时崛起，如何处理中印关系，不仅关乎两国的利益，而且对整个世界至关重要。”2023年12月3日，印度前驻华大使阿肖克·康特（Ashok K. Kantha）在2023年“读懂中国”国际会议间隙接受南方周末记者专访时说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;康特是印度资深外交官和中国专家，他曾任印度驻中国香港总领事，并于2014年至2016年担任印度驻华大使。 At present, Kangte works in the China Institute, a authoritative academic institution, is located in the Indian capital New Delhi and is the oldest Chinese issue research institution in India. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我前前后后在中国工作并从事中国研究15年，只能说对于中国具有一定的了解。中国很大，也很复杂，没有人敢说自己完全了解中国。”康特笑着说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为印度驻华大使，康特见证了中印关系的良好发展。在他任职期间，中印两国元首曾互访对方故乡。但他坦言，“目前中印关系需要解决一些悬而未决的问题，平稳度过”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“中印之间有很多相似之处。”康特说，历史上，两国曾经是世界上最大的经济体，但后续落后于世界发展，如今中印正在重新崛起，“双方应该互相支持”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;两个视角看中国&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;第一次参加“读懂中国”国际会议，你有什么感受？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;康特：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;对我来说，这是一个很好的机会，去试着理解中国在各种问题上的观点，特别是中国如何将中国故事讲述给外界。 This morning, I attended a closed -door seminar on Sino -US relations. Participants from China, the United States, South Korea, and India started a long discussion. I am also one of the speakers.这次讨论很有成效，可以帮助我们理解一个非常关键的问题——中美关系未来的发展轨迹将会如何影响整个世界。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;对于促进中印之间的互相理解，你有什么建议？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;康特：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;中国有着悠久的文明，也是世界第二大经济体和全球近四十个国家最重要的贸易伙伴。毫无疑问，涉及中国的问题都会引起包括印度在内的其他国家的关注，而中国的一些举措也会引发别国的担忧，所以了解中国的抱负以及中国如何发展是非常重要的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与此同时，中国是印度最大的邻居，印度也希望能够和中国保持友好关系。然而眼下，因为边界问题，两国关系正处于困难时期。如果边界问题不能正常化，中印整体关系就很难恢复常态化。在这样的背景下，我们希望能够传达我们的关切和期望。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;你之前曾担任印度驻中国大使，这次重回中国，有什么新感受？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;康特：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我在中国工作了很长时间。我第一次来中国是1981年，当时我还是一名年轻的外交官。后来，我又先后出任印度驻中国香港总领事和印度驻华大使。 But at that time, I worked in China as a diplomatic official. Today, I went to China as an ordinary citizen of India who studied Chinese issues to participate in the conference and tried to understand China. These are two different perspectives. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中印关系非常重要，这是一种复杂的关系，其中存在挑战，但我们希望与中国进行建设性的接触。早些年，我是代表印度在中国工作，看待问题的角度，具体的工作方式，都是不一样的。而作为一名普通公民，我可以以自己的方式来促进中印之间互相理解。尤其是我在中国有很多老朋友，我们可以开诚布公交谈，我会告诉他们印度有哪些担忧，期待中国做出哪些改变，我们之间的对话非常友好坦诚。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“人口第一”喜忧参半&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;2023年，印度超过中国，成为世界第一人口大国，这对印度意味着什么？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;康特：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我不认为它带来了很大的改变。印度和中国是世界上人口最多的两个国家，各自拥有约14亿人口。对于印度而言，我们需要承担更大的责任，去照顾如此庞大的人口，以确保国家不断发展。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;历史上，印度和中国曾经是世界上最大的经济体。英国知名经济学家安格斯·麦迪逊的研究指出，在17和18世纪，中国和印度的经济在世界上居于领先地位，但后来印度遭遇了殖民统治，失去了发展机会，经济增长不断放缓，GDP从当时占全球约25%降低到1950年的4%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现在，我们正在努力重建我们的国家和经济。过去三十年，印度一直做得很好，经济增长率仅次于中国。但我们还在很多领域面临巨大挑战，特别是在为人民提供更好的生活以及科技发展和转型方面。 China and India are very similar, we can learn from each other&#39;s experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;成为世界第一人口大国将给印度带来哪些机遇和挑战？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;康特：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;印度的一大优势是拥有非常年轻的人口。印度的人口年龄中位数大约是28岁，这就是我们所拥有的人口红利。青年人口越多，就意味着有更多的人服务于印度经济发展。我们必须充分利用这一红利，思考该如何让这些青年劳动人口为印度实现迈入发达经济体行列作出贡献。印度的目标是在2047年，也就是印度独立100周年之际，成为一个发达国家。这个任务虽然很艰巨，但印度正在朝着这一目标努力。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，印度每年要为近1200万新劳动力提供就业岗位，这个数字非常庞大。和中国相似，印度也面临着青年失业或者就业不足的问题，所以我们必须大规模创造新的就业机会。但只有确保经济继续增长，速度达到7%或8%，这一目标才能实现。这是一个很大的挑战，但我们能够应对这个挑战。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“没有中印参与，全球重大问题很难解决”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;作为中国最大的邻国，同时也是金砖成员国中的一员，印度如何看待与中国的关系？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;康特：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;印度和中国之间存在着复杂的关系，有许多悬而未决的问题，包括边界争议。中印双方都在尝试建立建设性的友好伙伴关系。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现在，中印边境局势并不稳定。如果边境问题不解决，两国的整体关系就很难恢复正常，所以我们面临的直接挑战，就是如何恢复边界的和平与安宁。现在，中印双方取得了一些进展，但仍有很多工作要做，我们需要进行更紧密、更有战略性的对话，使双边问题能够得到有效解决，从而为两国在区域性和全球性问题上共同合作创造条件。中国和印度是世界上人口最多的两个国家，同时位列世界五大经济体。如果没有中印参与，诸如气候变化、恐怖主义以及人工智能等全球重大议题都很难得到充分解决。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;作为世界上最大的两个发展中国家，双方该如何增强互信和合作？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;康特：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;中印过去在许多领域保持着良好合作，中国是印度的第二大贸易伙伴。 2022年，中印双边贸易接近1350亿美元。但印度也有些担忧，印度对华贸易逆差超过1000亿美元。印度期待寻求与中国进行更平衡的经济往来，但我们也需要尊重彼此的关切、利益和抱负。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现在中国和印度正在同时崛起，成为世界上的两个主要国家，在这个过程中，如何处理中印关系，不仅关乎两国的利益，而且对整个世界Crucial.中印两国可以同时崛起，双方应该互相支持。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“印度不会加入任何军事联盟”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;长期以来，印度在外交上奉行不结盟政策，但近年来，印度似乎在转向美国，并加强与日本的军事合作，你如何看待这一趋势？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;康特：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;印度寻求与世界上所有主要国家建立良好关系，不管是美国、中国，还是俄罗斯、日本和欧洲国家。但我们会保持独立的外交政策，基于具体问题作出决定，而不会加入任何军事联盟，这一基本国策没有改变。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;毫无疑问，印度和美国的关系已经发生了变化，尤其是过去20年。美国已经成为印度最大的贸易伙伴。我们与美国、西方国家和日本合作，是因为我们相信这对印度的经济和技术转型非常重要，其实中国也在与这些国家密切合作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;印度寻求与美国建立更紧密的联系，也在加强“四方机制”下的安全合作。但需要明确的是，美日印澳“四方安全对话”并不是一个军事机制，印度也不愿意加入任何联盟，我们就是要保持自己的战略自主。印度在俄乌冲突中的立场就说明了这一切，我们采取了与美国和西方国家截然不同的立场。印度将在所有问题上保持独立的外交政策，在某些议题上，我们会和美国日本合作，但在一些问题上，我们也可能与它们存在分歧。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;印度会关注哪些因素的影响？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;康特：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;印度不希望看到中美之间的任何对抗和武装冲突，因为这将对全球发展带来负面影响. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年11月，中美元首在旧金山举行会晤，这在一定程度上有助于恢复中美关系，印度欢迎这样的变化，也期待看到世界上最强大的两个国家重新建立更稳定的关系。但中美之间的战略竞争依然面临潜在的结构性挑战，双方关系将如何演变仍然并不明朗。我们期望中美避免发生冲突，因为这不符合双方的利益，也不符合包括印度在内的其他国家的利益。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 13:25:05 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
