He has edited 12 award-winning works, nearly half of them. This &quot;big event&quot; in the literary world has attracted a lot of attention recently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Huashang Daily, the real-name authentication was the WeChat public account &quot;Yuzhou Xinsheng&quot; (Yuzhou is the old name of Fangcheng County) of the Henan Federation of Literary and Art Circles. On October 26, an article titled &quot;&quot;Qingfeng&quot; was published. Fangcheng&#39;s article &quot;The list of prize-winning essays for literary and artistic works announced&quot; stated that the &quot;Qingfeng Fangcheng&quot; prize-winning essay competition jointly sponsored by the Fangcheng County Commission for Discipline Inspection and the Fangcheng County Federation of Literary and Art Circles was a complete success, and 25 works won one prize each. Second and third prizes and encouragement awards (this is the original text, but the announced list of winning works is actually only 23). What is shocking is that among the 23 award-winning works shown on the list, 12 are written by the same person &quot;Qiao Junli&quot;, including 1 first prize, 1 second prize, 4 third prizes, Encouragement awards for 6 articles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One person has won almost half of the awards. With such strength and talent, who is Qiao Junli? The list of editorial board members of &quot;Voices of Yuzhou&quot; attached at the end of the article shows that Qiao Junli is the editor-in-chief of this publication. An article previously published by the official social media account of the Fangcheng County Procuratorate showed that Qiao Junli is also the vice chairman of the Fangcheng County Federation of Literary and Art Circles. The Fangcheng County Federation of Literary and Art Circles is one of the organizers of this essay competition, and &quot;Voices of Yuzhou&quot; is the organizer of the event. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taking a closer look at the list of winners, at least 18 of the 23 award-winning works were written by members of the editorial board of &quot;Voices of Yuzhou&quot;. In addition to Qiao Junli&#39;s 12 articles, there is also Chief Editor Guo Shuan (Chairman of Fangcheng County Federation of Literary and Art Circles) won the second prize for one of his works; Xiong Mouxiang, deputy editor-in-chief, won second prize and third prize for two works respectively; deputy editor Li Mouyan, editorial board member Liang Moufeng, Planner Wu Mouhua also won an award for one article each. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I organized a prize-winning essay competition, and more than one of my own won the prize. There were also more than ten articles that won the prize at the same time, which is really amazing. &quot;Qingfeng Square City&quot;, where is the Qingfeng? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As we all know, in order to ensure fairness and impartiality in various formal public competitions, selections and other activities, the judges must remain neutral and should not have any interest in any contestant, and usually stipulate that one person can only win one award. . Even the lottery promotions organized by many commercial enterprises stipulate that employees and their families cannot participate, otherwise even if they win, they will be invalid. Not to mention that the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, as a social organization, is supported by public finance in China and is a public institution. As the organizer and organizer of the event, Fangcheng County Federation of Literary and Art Circles and its affiliated publications should maintain an objective and neutral stance to ensure the fairness of the award selection. As a result, the leaders of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles and members of the editorial board of the publication participated in the competition in person and won most of the awards. If you are both a referee and an athlete, how can you talk about the fairness of the game? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first Yangtze River Reading Award held by &quot;Dushu&quot; in 2000, Wang Hui, editor-in-chief of &quot;Dushu&quot;, and Qian Liqun, a judge, both won awards for their works, which caused huge controversy. Self-evaluation and self-awarding are of course inconsistent with the principle of fairness. To put it bluntly, in a sense, it is &quot;sharing the spoils.&quot; If the author believes that his work is good enough to qualify for the award, he should avoid suspicion. Not only should he not serve as a judge, he may even have to resign from the relevant position of the organizer, otherwise he should not participate in the award evaluation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The essay competition in Fangcheng County may also involve the issue of private allocation of public funds. Based on the bonus amount alone, this may not seem like a big deal. The first prize in the competition is only 500 yuan per article, the second prize is 400 yuan per article, the third prize is 300 yuan per article, and the encouragement prize is 200 yuan per article. Editor-in-chief Qiao won awards for 12 of his works, and the total bonus was only 3,300 yuan. However, Fangcheng County was once a poor county, and it was only removed from poverty in 2019. According to the 2022 Government Work Report of Fangcheng County, the county&#39;s GDP in 2021 is 29.3 billion yuan. Based on the county&#39;s more than 870,000 people in the seventh census in 2020, the per capita GDP is about 33,000 yuan, and the per capita disposable income of urban residents 33,574 yuan, and the per capita disposable income of rural residents is 16,315 yuan. In other words, the bonus Editor-in-Chief Qiao received from this prize-winning event is equivalent to 1/10 of the county’s annual per capita disposable income in cities and towns and 1/5 of the county’s annual per capita disposable income of farmers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this prize-winning essay competition jointly sponsored by the Discipline Inspection Commission and the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the source of prize money is probably financial funds. In such an essay competition, almost all the winners are from the same family, and one person won nearly half of the awards. People have to suspect that this is a clever pretext to use public funds to pay for themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, there is also a possibility that no one is interested in the essay competition, so the leaders of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles have to take action personally. According to the above, this essay competition will start on November 20, 2022, and will close on June 30. Although &quot;literary enthusiasts from all walks of life responded actively, mobilized extensively, and devoted themselves to creation,&quot; only 49 works were collected in more than half a year. It can be seen that there are not many &quot;literary enthusiasts&quot; in Fangcheng County, or they are not interested in such competitions, so few people submitted articles, and the quality of the submissions was also poor. In order to avoid the embarrassing situation of no one winning the award, Editor-in-Chief Qiao had to add his own works to the list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, if this is the case, the Federation of Literary and Art Circles cannot shirk its responsibility. As an organization of local literary and art workers, shouldn’t the Federation of Literary and Art Circles know how many literary workers and lovers there are in their county? It should be possible to estimate how many responses the essay call will receive. For a competition that is known to be uninterested, it is still planned and organized, and in the end one of one&#39;s own people comes forward to support the appearance and win the prize. This further strengthens the suspicion of &quot;creating a clever name to pay for oneself.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, similar phenomena do not only exist in Fangcheng County, but there are many other more serious ones. For example, the top leader of a state-owned enterprise in Yunnan once distributed tens of millions of yuan in &quot;rewards&quot; to himself under various names, but was eventually punished for corruption and other crimes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the organizers of this essay competition is the County Commission for Discipline Inspection, but it is ironic that such a scandal has occurred. Under the attention of public opinion, the Fangcheng County Federation of Literary and Art Circles has deleted the list of winners and claimed that the previous results were &quot;preliminary evaluation results&quot; and were released without the consent of the organizer. The next step will be to organize experts in the city to re-evaluate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fangcheng County also set up a special investigation team for this purpose. In the early morning of October 31, a situation statement was issued. The preliminary investigation determined that there were problems in the selection process and the selection results were invalid. As for the subsequent investigation and handling, &quot; released in due course. The public is looking forward to the final results of the investigation team. Perhaps the most appropriate solution is to cancel this essay solicitation and recover the funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 16:29:09 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[反向合资，中外车企探索合作新模式丨科创要闻]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259659]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-31 12:02:05&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/31/PMAhFrUA6OTlsple6X7qVTgBVZcJhXr6oXIcl8wf.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1408&quot; height=&quot;758&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/PMAhFrUA6OTlsple6X7qVTgBVZcJhXr6oXIcl8wf . png&quot; data-key=&quot;256200&quot; data-mce-width=&quot;0&quot; data-mce-height=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 24, GAC Group issued an announcement that the board of directors reviewed and approved the &quot; Announcement on Related Transactions Regarding the Reorganization of GAC Mitsubishi.&quot; GAC Group acquired 30% and 20% of the equity of GAC Mitsubishi held by Mitsubishi Motors Co., Ltd. and Mitsubishi Corporation respectively for a consideration of 1 yuan. After the reorganization is completed, GAC Mitsubishi will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of GAC Group, and GAC Aian will Utilize the GAC Mitsubishi plant to increase production and expand capacity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, it is not just Mitsubishi. With the rise of China&#39;s local car brands in recent years, joint venture brands such as Suzuki, Renault, Acura, Jeep, etc. have gradually withdrawn from the Chinese market. Some car companies will choose to use another model. Cooperate with domestic enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 26, Stellantis Group, the world’s fourth largest automobile manufacturer, and Leapmotor jointly announced that Stellantis Group plans to invest approximately 1.5 billion euros (approximately 11.6 billion yuan) to acquire approximately 20% of Leapmotor. % of the equity and obtained 2 seats on the board of directors of Leapmotor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with Volkswagen&#39;s acquisition of approximately 4.99% of Xpeng Motors&#39; equity for approximately US$700 million in July, Leapao&#39;s cooperation with Stellantis is more in-depth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Stellantis will not only participate in the Chinese market as a strategic investor of Leapmotor, but the two parties will also form a joint venture company, Leapmotor International, to jointly develop the international market. Leapmotor holds 49% of the shares and Stellantis Group Holds 51% of shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 1984, Beijing Jeep, the first Sino-foreign joint venture car company, was born. Foreign car brands came to China with technology and brands. China&#39;s modern automobile industry has gone through nearly 40 years of development with the &quot;market for technology&quot; model. In 2017, in the face of fierce competition and technological progress in China&#39;s new energy vehicle market, foreign car companies have begun to explore new models of cooperation with Chinese car companies, and &quot;reverse joint ventures&quot; are becoming a new option. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;[&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;01&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;]&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/frontier -risk-and-preparedness&quot;>;&lt;u>;OpenAI forms new team to assess &quot;catastrophic risks&quot; of artificial intelligence&lt;/u>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;October 26, artificial intelligence Intelligence research company OpenAI announced the formation of a new team, Preparedness, to assess and mitigate &quot;catastrophic risks&quot; associated with artificial intelligence.

There were many competitions, and they were very physically demanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At first, Zhang Peijin led six soldiers from his company to participate in the competition and was always far ahead. However, during the last armed three-kilometer run event, Wu Shanjie suddenly suffered from leg cramps and fell to the ground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to regulations, one team member is allowed to fall behind in this project without affecting the overall assessment results. Wu Shanjie, who was in unbearable pain, asked the company commander to put him down so as not to affect the final results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Peijin, who has participated in multiple subject assessments continuously, has already seen his clothes soaked with sweat and his physical strength is close to the limit. Looking at Wu Shanjie who fell to the ground, he gritted his teeth and said, &quot;&#39;Life and Death Company&#39; has no habit of leaving behind its comrades.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; As soon as he finished speaking, Zhang Peijin picked up Wu Shanjie on his back and sprinted towards the finish line. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the long journey of the last kilometer, Zhang Peijin got tired, so other comrades took over and took turns carrying Wu Shanjie until the end. The second team, which could have achieved better results, only finished fourth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Of course there will be regrets.&quot; Zhang Peijin confessed to Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;But compared with the results, it is more important for the comrades to stand side by side and rush to the finish line. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Never abandoning any teammate is a glorious tradition inherited by the Second Company from the smoke-filled war years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the honor room of the Second Company, a sculpture based on the story of a stretcher silently tells the origin of the company&#39;s name and also interprets the meaning of &quot;life and death together.&quot; &quot;The spiritual connotation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In June 1946, the company was ordered to cover the retreat of the main force. Soldier Zhu Jicai was shot in the leg and injured. Due to the hot weather and lack of medical treatment, his wounds became infected and ulcerated, and he was unable to walk. In order not to drag down the company, Zhu Jicai took the initiative to ask his comrades to put him down and continue marching. But faced with the encircling enemies, his comrades were unwilling to leave him behind. They made a simple stretcher out of branches and vines and carried him while marching and fighting with the red flag. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the critical juncture of life and death, the entire company dealt with dozens of times the enemy for more than 80 days. Not a single soldier was left behind. The mission was successfully completed. After the war, the company was ordered to Awarded the honorary title of &quot;Life and Death Together&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Over the past seventy years, the company has participated in more than 120 battles such as the Benxi Defense War, the Tashan Blockade, and the self-defense counterattack against Vietnam. Entering a new era, it has successively completed major tasks such as adjustment of the organizational structure, relocation of defenses, and cross-regional base-based exercises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The company fought in the north and south, its numbers were adjusted several times, and its location was constantly changed, but the glorious tradition of &quot;living and dying together&quot; has never changed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In the war years, my comrades rushed to the battlefield together. They dared to hand their backs to me, and I was willing to take bullets for them. This is the difference between life and death. Let&#39;s &#39;spirit together.&quot; After serving in the army for 11 years, Zi Guangyong has his own views on company spirit. He said that in peaceful times, this spirit is more reflected in daily training and every detail of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He gave an example. On the training ground, if a comrade was feeling unwell, he would help him carry his gun; during the exercise, if the task was difficult, they would complete it together. &quot;It&#39;s like a football match. You can&#39;t win the game just by playing alone.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Officers and soldiers of the &quot;Life and Death Company&quot; review the battle stories of the company&#39;s history.

It’s hard to imagine that when he first came to the army, he couldn’t even speak Mandarin well and “didn’t want to chat with others.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In September 2018, Zeren Tashi enlisted in the army from Ganzi, Sichuan. From the snowy plateau to the southeastern coast, Zeren Tashi clearly felt acclimated to the new environment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Worried that others would not understand what he said, and not wanting to worry his family by talking to them, Zeren Tashi, who was already introverted and sensitive, became increasingly withdrawn and depressed. During breaks, he would always go to the basketball court to play alone. When other comrades came over to play, he would quit and give up the court to others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When Zeren Tashi fell into deep self-doubt, his comrades came. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Bing Luojiang came from Guangxi in the same year. He was carefully aware of Zeren Tashi&#39;s emotions and used his own Mandarin as an example, but he was still a &quot;social cow&quot; , encouraging Zeren Tashi. From that time on, the enthusiastic Luo Jiang took Zeren Tashi to chat with his comrades every day to help him actively integrate into collective life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The company also opened &quot;a window&quot; specifically. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Whenever I encounter Chinese characters I don&#39;t know during study, my comrades will explain them to me carefully.&quot; Zeren Tashi said, and the company commander also encouraged He must be brave enough to show himself in front of everyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2022, during the subject demonstration activity organized by the Second Company, Zeren Tashi gave a sharing lesson to the company, and his confident behavior won the audience. Applause, &quot;There was a great sense of satisfaction at that time.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Currently, the Second Company has more than a dozen ethnic minority soldiers from Tibetan, Zhuang, Li, Mulao and other ethnic groups. Some of them are leaving their hometown for the first time, and some are recent college graduates, with different personalities and physical qualities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;How to make them feel the warmth of home in the company, the company has its own &quot;unique secrets&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Second Company produces a &quot;Knowledge of Soldiers&quot; for each recruit, including various aspects such as physical condition, family situation, interests and hobbies. &quot;In daily life, the backbone of the company cadres will take the initiative to talk to the recruits, understand their actual situation, and help them solve the difficulties in life.&quot; Instructor Wang Gaosheng told Southern Weekend reporters that during the training process, the squad leader will also teach them hand-in-hand. Integrate into the company as soon as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When he first joined the Second Company in 2022, Mulao soldier Qin Guoxing had not had time to get familiar with the company, but reality poured cold water on him. He is a graduate student from 211 College and is regarded as the &quot;proud son of heaven&quot; in the eyes of his parents and friends. However, in Erlian, where there are many experts, his business ability is often only at the bottom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Tin Guoxing felt frustrated and often tossed and turned at night and couldn&#39;t sleep. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Comrade Wang Lei saw Tan Guoxing like this and decided to help. Wang Lei is a &quot;veteran&quot; with solid and outstanding abilities and qualities. He took the initiative to play the role of a small instructor, training with Tan Guoxing, and teaching skills step by step. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Now, Qin Guoxing and Wang Lei have become a &quot;pair&quot; with each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In daily training, Wang Lei led Qin Guoxing to strengthen physical training, while Qin Guoxing helped Wang Lei answer questions in theoretical studies. In helping each other and competing, the two not only improved their performance, but also forged a deep friendship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Practice more with your brothers and you won&#39;t feel like you are walking alone.&quot; Qin Guoxing said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Big things on my mind&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;These are all obtained by our ancestors with blood and sweat. You need to find a way to fill the remaining vacancies. .&quot; On the day of joining the company, the company commander led the recruits to stand in front of the wall of honor, pointing to the wall of honor medals and saying, &quot;If the honor of the company is lost from your hands, it will be a disservice to the revolutionary martyrs of the second company.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;A unit with excellent military training results&quot;, &quot;A top company in basic subject competition training&quot;, &quot;Comprehensive construction of an advanced unit&quot;, &quot;Comprehensive construction of a model company&quot;... Enter the second company In the camp, a &quot;luxurious wall&quot; covered with honorary medals is shocking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Over the past few decades, the Second Company has been rated as an advanced company in comprehensive construction or an advanced unit of the &quot;Four Irons&quot; for 27 consecutive years, and has won the second-class collective merit 7 times, 18 times of collective third-class merit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When Lan Zhihao was still in the first company of the recruits, he had seen this wall through the window. He knew that this must be a heroic and honorary unit, and he was very eager to be assigned to the second company after the recruit training was completed. As a result, his wish came true. He was surprised, happy and full of energy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zeren Tashi&#39;s mood seems a bit complicated. He is proud to be a member of the &quot;benchmark company&quot; of the entire brigade, but also worried about not being able to keep up. The pace of training. In his words, &quot;I feel like I&#39;m done, and I might be choked in training.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Defending the honor of the heroic company has become a major issue that weighs on the minds of every officer and soldier of the second company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But in the main battle unit with so many strong men, such a goal is easy to say, but to achieve it requires extraordinary hard work and sweat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2022, a major training mission was held in Yunnan, and company commander Zhang Peijin led the entire company to participate. In order to win the victory, the Second Company began to make key preparations from the beginning of the year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;One month before the exercise, we organized soldier training during the day and worked overtime at night to deduce plans and study tactics.&quot; Zhang Peijin recalled, &quot;The backbone of the company also accompanied us. Stay up late with me, just to increase the chance of winning in the final battle.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Despite adequate preparation, the accident still happened. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the live-fire shooting session, Zhang Peijin and artillery technician Xiang Jinwen&#39;s company command vehicle suddenly experienced a transmission failure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;When changing the target and shooting, I can only hear the sound of the motor inside, but the shell cannot be fired.&quot; Xiang Jinwen made an instant judgment , &quot;It must be a jammed bullet.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Without any hesitation, Xiang Jinwen quickly raised the armored vehicle&#39;s gun, opened the back cover to determine the specific location of the jammed bullet. , and removed the fixing device of the artillery, and took out the shells with bare hands. The entire process, from problem arose to troubleshooting, took just over a minute. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As the artillery roared and the shells accurately hit the target, Xiang Jinwen&#39;s hanging heart was completely relieved. He said, &quot;This is a super-level performance.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the end, the Second Company stood out in the inspection and evaluation and was rated as an &quot;advanced unit against actual troops.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bite the &quot;hard bones&quot; together&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2015 4 In August, the company made personnel adjustments, and Xiang Jinwen was recommended to the Second Company for development because of his &quot;excellent professional quality.&quot; He feels very lucky because the Second Company is the model unit in the division. From the cadres to the recruits, everyone is proud to be here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;To date, Xiang Jinwen has stayed in the Second Company for more than eight years, and he has experienced several important milestones of the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2019, in order to adapt to future combat needs, the second company installed brand-new main battle equipment, which has better maneuverability, stronger firepower, and can achieve rapid Intersperse to achieve the effect of surprising and defeating the enemy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;All kinds of new equipment made the entire company excited. However, the ensuing practical difficulties of &quot;lack of teaching plans, lack of standards, and lack of talents&quot; also plagued the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The equipment is highly informatized and coincides with the retirement of many experienced technical backbones. The new equipment has brought us great challenges.&quot; Xiang Jinwen recalled, &quot;Every time the live-fire shooting results were very unsatisfactory.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Short-stop shooting requires that the armored vehicle must pause briefly and fire while moving. Aiming and shooting puts forward higher cooperation requirements for the cooperation of the driver, communicator and shooter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;From parking to launching to destroy the target and then to the vehicle moving, the whole process only takes six to eight seconds.&quot; Xiang Jinwen said, &quot;If the cooperation is not good, , it is easy for the vehicle to impact again before the shell is fired.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The time for training in the field is very tight, in order to squeeze out time to bond with teammates. Xiang Jinwen had almost no rest during that period and stayed on the training ground with his comrades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The heat in July and August is unbearable. After being exposed to the sun, the temperature inside the armored vehicle can reach more than 50 degrees. If you stay in the vehicle for a long time, it will not last long. Clothes can be squeezed out of water. Xiang Jinwen described that as soon as he got off the armored vehicle, he felt dizzy and &quot;wanted to vomit but couldn&#39;t.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;好在，向进文一行每次实弹射击都打出高水平，还在考核中取得了全优的成绩。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;显然，装备迭代更新带来的不仅是装备适应的难题，还需要与之相匹配的战术手段和战法打法，推动连队备战转型和能力升级。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;为了尽快形成战斗力，时任连长王小林带领全连干部骨干自制规范、自编教案，“摸着石头过河”进行战术演练。他们白天扎在训练场，晚上铆在装备间，两个多月潜心钻研，最终实现了战斗力全面提升。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“那个时候，每天晚上都是熬夜钻研，经常到凌晨一两点。”对于当时熬夜加训的情形，向进文记忆犹新，隔天一早也不赖床，继续早起学习新装备。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在同类型连队中，二连第一个接受检验，第一个开展课目示范，实现了旅队“当年形成战斗力”的目标。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;作为旅队里的“标兵连”，二连上下一心攻坚克难的案例数不胜数。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“连队日常担负着多个科目攻关和战法研究重任，但这些工作艰巨而又复杂，仅靠我个人的力量根本没有办法完成。”每当陷入到瓶颈时，身边的战友都会主动围拥到张培金身边，白天一起在训练场上打磨优化战术战法，晚上加班加点总结经验。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;张培金说，“我知道我不是一个人在战斗，我还有一帮兄弟帮我一同分担。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在今年旅组织的排战术考核中，二连一排被抽中代表连队参与考核。在与十几支分队同台竞技后，二连凭借在无人装备操作上的优势，远远把其他单位甩在后面，在考核中夺得第一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“为了迎接考核，我们排夜以继日进行操练，尤其是突出夜间无人装备使用。现在所有主战装备操作手，都熟练掌握了连队无人装备的操作使用方法。”排长刘楚十分自豪，“这块硬骨头，我们一起啃了下来。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（南方周末实习生冯嘉怡、蒋来、林曦、张馨怡对本文亦有贡献）&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;冶都开发的一个楼盘。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（南方周末记者卫琳聪/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在头部房企纷纷爆雷的当下，藏在河南县城里的小房企却引起了外界的注意。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因为前来参观的人太多，甚至影响了公司的正常运转，河南冶都置业有限公司（下称冶都）将对外接待时间限定为一周一次，每位参观者300元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这家扎根濮阳市清丰县的小型房企2022年接待了三百多组参观，不止地产同行，医疗、教育、餐饮等各类企业纷至沓来，称其为“地产界胖东来”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与超市界传奇胖东来一样，冶都也力求提供超一线水准的产品和服务。在其所建楼盘，标配健身房和阅读室，小区垃圾桶一天刷三次，员工餐厅下水道一天洗两次。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实上，冶都2010年才开始从事房地产开发，10年间只开发了6个楼盘，全部位于清丰县。这个地处河南东北部的县城总人口75万，2022年全县GDP237.7亿元，大约只有河南建业地产2021年收入的一半。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;清丰县向南170公里，位于商丘市的河南金沙置业集团有限公司（下称金沙）同样访客盈门。2023年10月底，北京一家地产咨询机构将金沙作为标杆房企，组织12省40余家房企高管前来参观交流。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;金沙的体量也不大。公司16年来开发了40个楼盘，分布在商丘8个县市。这个豫东城市2022年GDP在河南18地市中排名第7，刚刚突破3000亿元，不到郑州的1/4。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，在均价五千多元的县城里，金沙的楼盘卖出了过万的价格，小区物业还为业主提供婚嫁服务、免费体检等。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;多位河南地产业资深从业者告诉南方周末记者，其实在2021年之前，本土地产圈很少注意冶都、金沙这样的县城房企。“现在这个阶段，大家都在思考，房地产未来的发展方向可能是做产品、做服务。”其中一位说。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;县城里的“豪宅”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2018年，冶都在清丰县交付了第二个楼盘。这个楼盘拥有淡黄色的外立面，欧式大门在县城鹤立鸡群。正是在前一年，冶都提出“精细化”理念，公司总部也建在这个楼盘旁边。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年10月底，冶都将交付第7个项目。加入公司十余年的公司高管孙朝阳告诉南方周末记者，为了让外立面更好看，公司在上面花费了4个月时间。“色彩、线条一遍遍调整，把几个涂料供应商都搞得没脾气了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在一处已经交付的小区，楼下的绿化树被修成了圆球形。一位工作人员带着河南腔对南方周末记者说，这是公司去日本学习回来后改进的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;小区的保洁员看到访客立马停下手中的扫帚，微笑问好，年轻的脸上还化着妆。按照工作要求，她一天要用高压水枪把小区每一个垃圾桶从里到外清洗三遍。冶都招聘保洁员要求45岁以下，每月工资5000多元，比县里平均水平高一倍。安居客显示，目前冶都在售楼盘每平方米均价5000元左右，普遍比同区域房源价格高七八百元。尤其是在大本营清丰县，当地新房均价仅3000元左右，冶都堪称县城里的“豪宅”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;金沙则在近日的官方微信推送中称，其位于商丘夏邑县的一个楼盘，在门口移植了“7棵珍稀松树”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者以购房者名义咨询，金沙置业顾问表示，公司开发的楼盘价格普遍较区域项目更高，高端项目均价能达到1.5万/平方米。据安居客数据，这一价格比商丘新房均价高出1万元/平方米。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;更早喊出“精细化”口号的是永威置业集团有限公司（下称永威）。永威置业2005年成立于河南郑州。河南房地产圈曾流传一句顺口溜：“永威有三宝，建材、景观、物业好。”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;金沙直接把永威的顺口溜拿来用。永威一位负责人告诉南方周末记者，为了学习永威，金沙创始人杨利民甚至在永威开发的楼盘买了房。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;兰德咨询公司总裁宋延庆从事房地产咨询和投资二十多年，他向南方周末记者解释，精细化是在建筑过程中对品质进行把控。假设地面、墙面、天花板上有三条缝，精细化施工要保证三条缝对齐，避免出现错缝、破坏美感。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他介绍，早在2013年前后，各大房企就已提出精细化理念，但房地产市场迅猛发展，高杠杆、高周转模式大行其道，规模取代质量成为更重要的指标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;永威从2007年开始走精细化路线，以郑州为大本营，累计开发36个项目。其位于郑州北龙湖的高端项目均价超过6万元/平方米，是当地知名豪宅。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最初永威也曾向同行学习。在郑州本土房企康桥地产负责品牌营销工作的张莹倩告诉南方周末记者，康桥就是依靠品质打出名声，后起的永威曾从康桥挖走几十人的团队。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张莹倩入行超十年，她表示，各大房企发展之初，都在品质上竞争，不惜成本打造标杆项目。“从0到1的时候主要是依靠产品，所以都走精细化路线，因为只能通过产品来获得第一批种子客户。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尤其在河南房地产市场上，由于房企数量众多，对品质的竞争更为激烈。中国房地产业协会数据显示，2022年河南房企数量超过8000家，位居全国第4。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经过高速发展，郑州房企已度过原始积累阶段，而县城房企正在经历从0到1的突破，曾经发生在郑州市场的品质竞争正在县城重新上演。张莹倩透露，近两年金沙又从康桥地产高薪挖走营销、工程、设计等负责人。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;高杠杆的教训&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在棚改政策刺激下，2016年前后，河南房地产市场也开始起飞。国家统计局数据显示，2016年郑州商品房销售面积超过3000万平方米，较上一年增加一倍还多。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“简直就像捡钱一样。”在冶都负责品牌策划的王志兴对南方周末记者说。那个时候，他在安阳市做新房销售代理，经常一开盘就清盘，销售火爆到连售楼部都不需要，打个广告语就开始卖房。各楼盘之间不比质量，更看重位置和价格。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;外来房企也更多地进入河南。继恒大、碧桂园之后，融创、金科、蓝光等规模房企相继在2016年前后进入河南攻城掠地。本土房企则排队上市，建业更是逐步下沉，到2019年覆盖了河南一百多个县级城市。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;孙朝阳亦回忆，当时县域市场也一片火热。“只要手里拿了地，不用关注什么产品，就能快速销售、快速回款。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但冶都反而放缓拿地，公司当时想要“慢一点、稳一点”，这和创业之初遭遇的挫折有关。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2010年，冶都初涉房地产，创始人程晓锋曾通过钢材贸易赚到第一桶金，他的父亲在安阳钢铁集团工作，带领他从老家安阳到隔壁濮阳清丰县拿了一块地。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1980年出生的程晓锋十几岁就进入社会闯荡，早年做过厨师、开过货车，在冶都引起关注后也极少公开露面。他长时间待在公司，几乎认识每一个员工，经常在公司讲起当年创业的故事。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那时在安阳、濮阳一带投资房地产门槛并不高。王志兴2011年入行，他记得当时只用交地价10%的保证金就能拿地，他代理销售的第一个项目占地70亩，只交了210万元就启动开发。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;孙朝阳介绍，开发第一个楼盘时，公司自有资金少，主要靠银行、个人等外部借款。因为缺乏开发经验，项目亏了一个多亿。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据《凤凰周刊》报道，2012年，安阳爆发民间集资崩盘事件。当地自2009年起大兴民间借贷，产生了三百多家高息揽储公司，至少两百多亿资金卷入其中，流向地产、能源等领域。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当地一位房企高管回忆，安阳集资对整个区域的金融环境产生了极大影响，银行开始抽贷，个人借款要求提前归还。冶都也受到影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;于是从第二个项目开始，冶都便不再借助外部融资。“就想着不能挣快钱。”孙朝阳说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但当时的市场行情下，地价不断被推高。到了2018年，濮阳一亩地飙到180万元，只靠自有资金的冶都并无优势。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另一重限制在于，冶都当时没有多少员工。县城企业招人难，人员储备也不足以支撑公司扩张。直到2020年，冶都发展了10年，员工人数才增加到一百名左右。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;和冶都一样，金沙在前几年市场火爆时动作也不多，郑州地产圈的从业者们对其知之甚少。其中一位资深从业者总结，受资金和人员限制，在大房企狂飙突进的阶段，县域房企难以与其竞争。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;逆势发展&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;河南的独特之处在于，县域市场依然给当地小房企留下了生存空间。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;河南省政府公布的数据显示，2022年河南常住人口城镇化率为57.07%，这一数字比全国平均水平低8.15个百分点。清丰县统计局数据显示，2022年当地城镇化率仅35.12%&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;全国性房企在大规模扩张时也曾进入县城市场，一度对本土小房企造成冲击。孙朝阳介绍，2018年前后，碧桂园、建业等相继进入清丰县，冲击之下，冶都的销量一度下滑20%。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但县城房价低，利润空间有限，对大房企来说并不是重点市场。加之公司体量大，管理半径难以触达县城。经过几年发展，碧桂园在清丰县只开发了两个楼盘，建业则与当地开发商合作，以轻资产方式进行开发。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对扎根县城的小房企而言，这块利润较薄的市场却是安身立命之地。孙朝阳认为，区域市场的购房需求依然存在，尤其是一部分投资需求转换成了二次置业需求。通过精耕细作，在控制成本的前提下提高质量，县城房企在这部分客群中赚到了利润。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2020年以来，在“三道红线”等房地产政策调控下，信贷环境收紧。叠加新冠疫情对经济环境的影响，高杠杆、高周转模式受到冲击，依靠这一模式发展起来的大房企纷纷爆雷。而县城里的小房企反而逆势发展。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;孙朝阳介绍，2020年冶都开始走出清丰县，3年间新开11个楼盘，员工增加了三百多人。这段时间市场不景气，县城地价回落，冶都抓住机会一口气拿了五百多亩地，土地成本比2018年高价期省了不止两个亿。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;能逆势拿地源于公司负债率低。冶都用自有资金开发项目，不使用银行贷款，目前现金流在保证公司正常运转的情况下还有富余。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“老板原话，我们可以停半年什么都不干。”王志兴说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同样在2020年后快速发展的金沙，也在官方微信公号中宣称，公司负债率常年保持在5%-10%。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/u4BoW0srd2cdubOGlD0MGp9PIheyOoeZb7GocKLC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;

&lt;p>;2023年国庆假期后，金沙前往郑州和各大开发商会谈合作，想要进军郑州，在豪宅区北龙湖打造标杆项目。张莹倩参与了会议。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种从打造产品到规模扩张的路径让张莹倩感到熟悉。康桥地产在最初靠产品打出名声后，金融机构和咨询公司纷纷上门，劝说老板学习高周转模式，扩大规模。最终在2019年前后在上海建了分部，开始向南方扩张。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但刚走出河南就遭遇行业寒冬，康桥地产扩张受阻。如今，张莹倩又在朋友圈看到，当初劝说自己老板扩大规模的咨询公司，又前往金沙交流了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;来找冶都合作的人也多起来，有些有钱，有些有地，开出优惠条件邀请他们去郑州、进北京。“行情不好的时候（寻求合作）会更多。”孙朝阳说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但冶都并没有答应。公司目前的发展规划依然没有超出濮阳所在的豫北地区。“谁都想往外走，但更应该认清自己。我们现在没有能力跑到外面。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;更大的问题是，高杠杆、高周转模式营造的规模神话已经破灭，房企还能走向哪里？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管逆势扩张，但冶都也难免受到市场环境影响。王志兴表示，现在公司在清丰的4个楼盘加起来，月销量才一百多套，以前一个楼盘就能达到这样的水平。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;冶都想出的办法是向服务转型。2021年，程晓锋提出在小区开设面点房，售卖手工馒头。员工们觉得不可思议，“卖馍能挣几个钱？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但这个想法还是被执行，并从面点房拓展到超市、干洗、家政等各项服务。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年，冶都在总部旁边开了一家500平方米的超市。王志兴介绍，2022年仅为了学习如何开超市，公司就花了一百多万元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同在河南的胖东来是重点学习对象。冶都超市配备了和胖东来同款戴森洗手池，斥资两万多元，还提供茶水、婴儿车、免费充电等服务。商品同样和胖东来一样自采自营，馒头、面条和豆芽甚至是自己生产的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;超市工作人员向南方周末记者介绍，公司计划在清丰县人流量大的地方再开三家同等体量的超市，小区里开设规模较小的店。但目前第一家店尚未盈利。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;冶都的想法是做衣食住行全链条的配套服务，未来还要做餐饮、开药店。不仅针对业主，也面向全县百姓。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“公司希望未来把服务作为核心赢利点，地产只是&#39;顺带&#39;。”孙朝阳说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（应受访者要求，张莹倩、孙朝阳为化名）&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;哥本哈根一项长期随访的心脏研究就曾发现，白头发、脸部皱纹以及男性秃顶就是几个明显的衰老标志，可能表明人们有更高的风险患心肌梗死，特别是白头发长得多的人，相比没有白头发的，风险升高的更明显。除了这些具体的外在特征，笼统地感觉到“长相偏老”&amp;nbsp;对评估健康风险而言也有参考意义。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;受穿着打扮等外在因素干扰，仅凭视觉信息猜一个人的年龄并不容易。2016年，南丹麦大学公共卫生研究所的研究人员在对近两百组同卵双胞胎做对比研究时就发现，即便是有着同样基因和极为相似长相的双胞胎，人们仍然能从他们面部的差别中读到过快衰老的线索。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些双胞胎老人早在2001年时就已年过七旬，研究人员请人通过他们的证件照头像猜测老人的年龄，结果发现，不论是改变面部还是穿着打扮，都会影响人们对老年人年龄的感知。而十多年后的统计还显示，双胞胎中长相看起来更老的人，更早去世的可能性也更大。面部的线索在一定程度上成了生存或者死亡风险的一个预测因素。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;虽然有不少研究都已经发现了藏在面容背后的一些健康秘密，但系统性分析长相情况与衰老关系的研究却不多。为了弄清楚长相与年龄不符究竟意味着什么，2023年3月，荷兰伊拉斯姆斯大学等机构的研究人员通过分析更多的数据，尝试调查了人们所感知到的年龄与一系列衰老相关疾病之间的关系。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;更显年轻，更健康&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;结果不出所料，与长相偏老的人风险更高对应的是，那些看起来比实际年龄更年轻的人，他们患多种年龄相关疾病的风险都更低，总体上也有更好的认知功能。相关研究发表在《英国皮肤病学杂志》（British Journal of Dermatology），为科学看脸提供了一定参考。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;长相与年龄不符的现象在日常生活中很常见。而要想更科学深入地认识这一现象，就要先区分其中三个关于年龄的概念。除了人们仅靠长相就可以评估的感官年龄外，对健康和衰老较具参考价值的还包括实际年龄和生理年龄。 &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;长期研究衰老问题的哥伦比亚大学公共卫生学院副教授丹尼尔·贝尔斯基（Daniel W. Belsky）告诉南方周末记者，“实际年龄测量的是出生以来的时间，而生理年龄则是衡量健康的标准。一个生理年龄值可以理解为一个人在这个实际年龄时的典型健康状态。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也就是说，按照正常衰老速度，一个健康状况良好的人，其生理年龄与实际年龄应该是趋近乃至一致的。但现实中，一些人的生理年龄会比较明显地偏离实际年龄，呈现出非典型的健康状态。其中，生理年龄比实际年龄小的话，说明其总体的健康状况比一般的同龄人更好，而生理年龄大于实际年龄的人，衰老的程度更深。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最新研究中对感官年龄的分析实际上探索了通过视觉这种简单的方式去识别衰老的可能性，而结果表明，长相更年轻的话，对应的多种疾病的风险确实更低。具体来看，长相看起来比实际年龄年轻五岁的话，骨质疏松、慢性阻塞性肺疾病、白内障和听力下降等方面的风险就会显著更低，同时认知表现更好。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些结果是基于2600多名欧洲中老年人健康数据的分析，值得注意的是，纳入研究的人年龄分布从五十多岁到八十多岁，正处于年龄相关疾病明显升高的阶段。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;年轻人的身体不一定年轻&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;尽管目前相关研究多关注中老年人，但是并不意味着成熟和衰老的节奏只在进入中年期后才开始突然加快。已有证据表明，二三十岁的年轻人在实际年龄稳定增长的过程中，其生理年龄的差距就已经开始显现。从具体表现看，老得更快的人身体能力更差，还出现认知能力下降和大脑老化的情况。这些人通常自己也能感觉到健康状况变差了，同时长相看起来也更老。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;相关研究2015年发表在《美国科学院院刊》（PNAS）。更为残酷的是，这些观测到的衰老差距发生在人们26岁到38岁之间。同样是未到中年的38岁，不同人的生理年龄却差异明显。现为哥伦比亚大学流行病学系及衰老研究中心副教授的丹尼尔·贝尔斯基曾参与这项研究。在近12年的时间段里，研究人员记录了近千名参与者一系列生理指标的变化。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“衰老是从生命早期就开始的一个过程。我们可以在健康的年轻人身上看到它的迹象，并且有些人在年轻的时候就已经比其他人衰老得更快。因此，保持健康的生活方式，寻求有干净空气和水的环境，这些才是安全、可靠的，创造机会参与社交也是一个优先事项。”丹尼尔·贝尔斯基告诉南方周末记者，“在某些方面，这都是不言而喻的。但重要的是要认识到，即使在我们倾向于认为坚不可摧的青年时期，我们的生活方式和环境也会影响我们衰老的轨迹，并产生长远影响。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;目前，对衰老的研究并不容易，因为相比小鼠等动物研究中可以快速地观测动物的一生，人类由出生到死亡的时间跨度要长得多。进入中老年后，年龄相关疾病的增多使观察人的衰老变得更容易，相对来看，年轻人衰老的迹象不太容易捕捉。然而对于延缓衰老，年轻人其实有更多时间和机会去做出改变，以改善自身健康。因此，尽早识别出衰老的迹象，了解衰老的规律，在老龄化的背景下对减轻全球公共卫生压力有重要意义。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;提早感知衰老的迹象&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“我不确定个人是否真的需要测量他们的生理年龄。” 丹尼尔·贝尔斯基解释，流行病学研究中需要对衰老进行测量，一方面是为了识别那些加速或延缓衰老的因素，另外也是为了评估一些延缓衰老的项目、政策、生活干预措施和药物疗法等是否有效。“不过，对于那些确实希望了解更多自己衰老和健康状况的人，市场上其实有一系列的工具可以帮助估计生理年龄，从血样检测到DNA检测都有。这些检测本身并不危险，但结果应该谨慎解释，最好在医疗保健专业人员的帮助下去解读相关的结果。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年9月，《柳叶刀健康长寿》（The Lancet Healthy Longevity）发表的一项研究报告显示，胸部X光检查这种已经广泛利用的技术有可能用于辅助评估人的衰老。通过训练、开发相关的人工智能模型，研究人员利用胸片来估计当事人的年龄。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而结果显示，对于身体较为健康的人，人工智能通过胸片估计出的年龄与实际年龄有很强的相关性。但对于已患有疾病的人，估算的年龄与实际年龄之间的差异与多项慢性病有关，可以识别出高血压、间质性肺疾病、慢性肾功能衰竭等风险的升高。这意味着胸片这种常见的图片信息有可能成为一种衰老的生物标志物帮助人们评估慢性病的状况甚至预测寿命，同时提升个性化干预治疗的水平。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与这些借助医学设备的方式相比，直接看脸，靠长相与年龄是否相符来大致评估衰老和相关的健康风险，虽然精准度有限，但显然更为简洁。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，需要注意的是，包括看脸来评估感官年龄在内，目前多项相关研究虽然样本数以千计，但来源相对单一，缺乏足够的代表性，而人种差异在感官年龄评估中实际上起着重要的作用，这也是相关研究目前的一个明显的局限。长相与年龄不符的健康启示是否在各类社群中均有效，仍有待更多研究去确认。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;皮肤衰老的对比研究很早就发现，亚洲人和欧洲人皮肤衰老的轨迹很不一样。以中国和法国女性为例，小样本的研究显示，中国女性脸上开始长皱纹的时间比法国女性差不多要晚十年，这个时间差会使得中国女性在此时明显看起来更年轻，但到了四十多岁，中国女性在面部皱纹方面会经历快速衰老，呈现出非线性的态势，而相较来看，法国女性在此方面的衰老是相对稳定的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;诸如此类，由于不同人种面部发展上的差异，套用一个群体里的感官经验去推测另一个群体里人们的年龄，准确率会比较受限。外加不同社会里人们穿着打扮方面的文化差异，在跨文化的背景下去认识长相与年龄不符的现象，可能会发现不同的规律。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;延缓衰老的努力&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;其实，在看脸方面，长相与年龄是否相符只是一方面。2022年，有生物学研究还发现，长相的吸引力和免疫功能等健康指标之间可能也存在某种联系。在一系列实验和检测后，研究人员发现那些外表更具吸引力的人，他们免疫表现也更好。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;参与这项研究的得克萨斯基督教大学实验社会心理学研究人员萨默·门格尔科赫（Summer Mengelkoch）告诉南方周末记者，虽然一个人太在意外貌吸引力的话可能会显得自己很肤浅，但他们的研究表明，人们在关注伴侣外貌吸引力的时候，实际上在意的可能不只是长相，而是也有可能籍此挑选出一个健康的伴侣。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最新研究从感官年龄和实际年龄的差距入手，为科学看脸提供了更多的证据。而尽早识别衰老的迹象及风险因素，就可以为延缓衰老采取行动。2023年5月，哈佛大学医学院的研究人员在小鼠和人类研究中发现，生理年龄在压力的影响下会出现双向波动，压力过大时生理年龄会增加，而从压力中恢复之后，生理年龄又会逆转修复。这或可为未来针对衰老的干预提供适合的切入点。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“无论是人到中年，还是尚且年轻。要想促进健康的老龄化，我们能做的事情其实是一样的，吃健康的饮食，做大量的体育活动，参与家人、朋友和社区的社交，培养目标感和意义感，避免毒性压力和污染。”丹尼尔·贝尔斯基向南方周末记者强调，“科学界现在正在研发可以减缓生理老化，延长健康生命周期的新药。与此同时，我们已经知道如何通过改变我们的生活环境来促进健康老龄化，那就是要减少污染，确保安全有保障的住房环境，提供负担得起的健康食品。我们也应该在这些方面进行投入。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
