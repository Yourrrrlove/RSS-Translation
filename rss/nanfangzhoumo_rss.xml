This episode with a tough-to-pronounce name announced the complete end of the ten-year &quot;Attack on Titan&quot; animation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that everything has settled, we can fully evaluate &quot;Attack on Titan&quot; (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Attack on Titan&quot;), the most popular and topical Japanese animation work in the past decade. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/EAtAXg52wGhYOn1Rm5NNB1ZyHtWjuUIZa3PD9LtB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height= &quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/EAtAXg52wGhYOn1Rm5NNB1ZyHtWjuUIZa3PD9LtB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258823&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The classic scene of the giant staring in &quot;Attack on Titan&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Why is &quot;Giant&quot; so popular? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;To evaluate the work &quot;Giant&quot;, the first question that must be answered is: Why is &quot;Giant&quot; so popular and discussed globally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/ypYjeefyRY4CiYEcGnOjEDEECvEE7Ztn1J09SPeZ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;342&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/ypYjeefyRY4CiYEcGnOjEDEECvEE7Ztn1J09SPeZ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258821&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The classic gesture of the protagonist of &quot;Attack on Titan&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Japan, television is still the main broadcast channel for animation. The vast majority of Japanese animations in the Chinese context are classified as late-night programs. They usually air after midnight. This broadcast schedule shows that these animations were not considered to be produced for the public from the beginning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is because Japanese cultural products have formed an industry with extremely mature market segmentation. Almost every work that appears in such a market is specialized for its main audience group, and the same is true for Japanese animation as a late-night TV show. Popular works during the same period when the first season of &quot;Giant&quot; was aired included &quot;There&#39;s Something Really Wrong with My Youth Love Story&quot;, &quot;How Can My Sister Be So Cute&quot;, &quot;Date A Live&quot;, &quot;The Perverted Prince and the Laughing Cat&quot;, &quot;Let&#39;s Work&quot; ! &quot;Demon Lord&quot;, &quot;A Certain Scientific Railgun S&quot;, etc. These animations, from background settings, characters, to story directions, are all customized for Japanese animation lovers in the traditional sense and can appeal to these core target groups. Good, but it also limits the dissemination of these works to a wider public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Correspondingly, the conventional production concept of Japanese animation has always been low cost and small output. In the Japanese animation industry, which has long relied on DVD and Blu-ray discs as its main profit channels, an animation can be considered a best-seller if it can sell 10,000 discs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Giant&quot; is an &quot;alien&quot; in Japanese animation. The average sales volume of the nine-volume animated disc of &quot;Giant&quot; in the first season was 52,067 copies, and as of August 2016, the total sales volume was 468,603 copies. It was also the number one selling TV animation in Japan in 2013. In mainland China, iQiyi, which exclusively introduced the copyright, received a total of 320 million online views by the end of the first season. In North America, the work has sold 200,000 copies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the Japanese animation works, the production level of &quot;Giant&quot; is far higher than the industry average (regardless of the graphics, actions, and soundtrack). This is the production company of the previous seasons of &quot;Giant&quot; Wit Studio has earned the nickname &quot;Hegemonic Society&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The production cycle of the &quot;Giant&quot; animation is also different - such a popular work did not continue to work while the iron was hot. The second animated season of &quot;Giant&quot; airs, four years after the first season. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This long pause comes from the decision of &quot;Hegemony Society&quot;. The company believes that the success of &quot;Giant&quot; is mainly due to its own production level, and thinks that instead of producing &quot;Giant&quot; animation whose copyright does not belong to itself, To earn some hard-earned money, it is better to use production resources like &quot;Giant&quot; to produce your own original animation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This animation is &quot;Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress&quot; (hereinafter referred to as &quot;The Iron Fortress&quot;), and Wit Studio has devoted considerable resources to it. Judging only from the animation quality outside of the plot, &quot;Iron Castle&quot; is better than the first season of &quot;Giant&quot;. However, &quot;Iron Castle&quot; is far from meeting Wit Studio&#39;s expectations in terms of reputation and popularity. The shortcoming lies in the story of &quot;Iron Castle&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This &quot;detour&quot; of Wit Studio just provides a control group, allowing us to clearly see the root cause of the popularity of &quot;Giant&quot; through the control variable method-its own story. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different from those stories with &quot;otaku&quot; attributes that are generally targeted at two-dimensional enthusiasts in the Japanese industry, &quot;Giant&quot; is an extremely rare work that is truly created according to the model of popular works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/0IMa5Hcv5KLsY818h8abDian5L1jDBT82RpJW9Vp.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/0IMa5Hcv5KLsY818h8abDian5L1jDBT82RpJW9Vp.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258822&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In &quot;Attack on Titan&quot;, humans and titans fight. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The popular pop culture works have some very basic characteristics, that is, they do a good job of showing the world view, On the basis of suspense creation, rhythm control, characterization, etc., use good production level to tell a story well. The original comic book &quot;Giant&quot; followed this rule until the final ending - good-looking stories are liked by people. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;How to evaluate &quot;Giant&quot;? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Since the popularity of &quot;Giant&quot; mainly comes from the original comic, the evaluation of &quot;Giant&quot; should also be based on the original comic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the &quot;Giant&quot; comic, readers at the time had this to say: When the final chapter of the &quot;Giant&quot; comic was released, the fans of &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot; were the happiest because there would be more comics in the new century. The status of the ceiling is preserved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It seems almost a joke, but it is actually fair. Before the end, the &quot;Giant&quot; comic was expected to become the strongest shounen comic since 2000, but in the end it failed to reach the top due to problems with the ending. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The qualifiers such as &quot;new century&quot;, &quot;monthly updates&quot; and &quot;shounen comics&quot; are not like the increasingly subdivided statistics in sports competitions. &quot;As long as you add enough qualifiers, everyone can win.&quot; It is possible to become the first in history in some aspects.&quot; It&#39;s because, in a place like Japan that emphasizes market segmentation, there are great differences between different types of Japanese comics. Not only youth comics, shounen comics, and girls&#39; comics have completely different creative models and concepts. Even if they are both shounen comics, monthly comics and weekly comics are almost two completely different ecologies due to the difference in publication frequency and length of each issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, trying to simply and crudely bring together works from different creation eras in &quot;Guan Gong vs. Qin Qiong&quot; will not lead to valuable conclusions. Japanese comics, which are highly commercialized, are largely driven by readers’ preferences. Therefore, the story direction and themes expressed in a comic largely reflect the acceptance of the mainstream audience at that period, and are not solely determined by the author. Moreover, the comics created later are more likely to be more perfect in terms of plot and plot than the previous works. Putting aside these talks about the degree of completion and the level of narration, it is unavoidable that the book &quot;focuses on the present and ignores the past&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even the most important indicators to measure the success of a commercial work - popularity and sales - cannot be used as a basis for comparing the quality of works across eras. The current Internet environment, coupled with the increasingly saturated marketing of producers, and the continuous development of markets outside Japan, have resulted in current works generally having higher popularity and sales than in the past. For example, when &quot;Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba the Movie: Mugen Train&quot; was released, it broke the Japanese movie box office record of &quot;Spirited Away&quot; which had been held for more than 20 years, and now ranks first in the box office history of Japanese movies. But I&#39;m afraid not many people would think that the quality of &quot;Demon Slayer&quot; really surpasses &quot;Spirited Away&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, how do you evaluate what kind of work &quot;Giant&quot; is in the history of Japanese comics? You might as well change your thinking and think about this question: When will the next highly topical Japanese comic work like &quot;Giant&quot; appear, and can it avoid the unfinished ending of &quot;Giant&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For current and future Japanese comics, works like &quot;Giant&quot; with a complete world structure and description of social organization are rare. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The world constructed in comic works actually comes from the author&#39;s own worldview and values. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back at the history of Japanese comics, you will find that the eras in which cartoonists in previous periods provided them with rich life experiences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The earliest cartoonists, such as Osamu Tezuka and Fujiko F. Fujio, personally experienced World War II and the reconstruction of postwar Japan. In their works, they can well grasp the grand propositions of war and human destiny. For example, Osamu Tezuka&#39;s &quot;Firebird&quot; is a grand work on the theme of the universe and life that cannot be surpassed in the history of Japanese comics. Fujiko Fujio&#39;s &quot;Doraemon&quot;, even though it is a funny comic for children, does not forget to make Doraemon and Nobi Nobita laugh and cheer in the work: &quot;Japan is defeated!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The subsequent generation of Japanese cartoonists personally experienced the Japanese left-wing movement in the 1960s and 1970s, which affected the depth and value of exploring social propositions in their works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Next, as Japan’s economy took off in the 1980s, cartoonists who grew up in this era had an international vision that surpassed their predecessors. Their works also began to really focus on the real world outside Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today’s young manga authors are living in Japan during the “lost thirty years” after the economic bubble burst. Corresponding to the economic stagnation is the slow development of Japanese society and the isolation of popular culture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Comic writers who grew up in this environment not only have difficulty understanding the real relationship between countries, but also have difficulty understanding the logic of social operations. This has led to a large number of Japanese comics now. When they were still within the scope of campus in the early stage, the plots and characters looked pretty good. Once the plot develops beyond the scope of the school in the later period, various flaws will appear in the character logic and world setting, eventually leading to a bad ending. The same is true for popular works in recent years, such as &quot;Kaguya-sama Wants Me to Confess ~ Geniuses&#39; Battle of Love Minds ~&quot;, &quot;The Promised Neverland&quot;, and &quot;BEASTARS&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From this perspective, works like &quot;Giant&quot; are rare in the current Japanese comic industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The difficulty of world building is only one aspect. &quot;Giant&quot; has the current popularity mainly because of its control of the story rhythm before the end. Before Chapter 90, the &quot;Giant&quot; comic achieved the charm that &quot;information asymmetry&quot; should have. Various hidden clues are revealed bit by bit, gradually piecing together a complete world. In this process, the foreshadowing and echoes before and after the comics can be said to be like a gray line and a thousand miles of hidden connections. This joy of exploration is the most attractive part of &quot;Giant&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what if we don’t demand the authenticity of the world view, but instead ask, &quot;Can there be another Japanese comic with a story as exciting as &quot;Giant&quot; that is not unfinished at the same time?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It doesn’t seem easy either. This is because, for a comic published in serial form, the fascinating previous plot and the bad ending are actually highly positively correlated. This form of serialization determines that Japanese comics are a matter of &quot;killing the king and taking the road&quot;. If you want to catch the attention of readers in the highly involved Japanese comics industry, you must make various abnormal plots in the early stages of comics that are &quot;not shocking but endless&quot;. The more these plots violate the logic of daily behavior, the easier it is to arouse readers&#39; interest. However, in order for the story to proceed normally, the author must give a reasonable explanation to these abnormal passages in the subsequent plot. This in itself is an almost impossible task. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Almost all Japanese comics have this problem. For example, one of the flaws of &quot;One Piece&quot;: the ceiling of the entire comic&#39;s combat power, why the red-haired one of the four emperors had his arm bitten off by a sea monster at the beginning of the comic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What makes this situation worse is the high update frequency of Japanese comics. As a weekly Japanese comic, comics authors are generally required to update more than ten pages of content every week, while monthly magazines generally require thirty to forty pages of content per issue. During this period, the author has to complete story and line conception and storyboard design, as well as comic drawing from draft to final product. Although most cartoonists hire more than one assistant, the work intensity of cartoonists is still far beyond what most people imagine. Under such a continuous and high-intensity working state, it is difficult to expect comic writers to maintain the exquisite conception of the story. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In contrast, &quot;Giant&quot;&#39;s clever handling of various early foreshadowings and clues seems so unusual among Japanese comics. It is also the continuous increase of previous characters and story lines that increases the difficulty of ending the entire story and also raises readers&#39; expectations. All this has become an unsolvable problem before the author Isayama Hajime. In the end, he chose an ending that puzzled most readers. This kind of regret is unavoidable when you think about it carefully. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 08:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[第十一届茅盾文学奖颁奖，专访茅奖新晋得主]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260851]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;On the evening of November 19, the 11th Mao Dun Literature Award Awards Ceremony was held in Tongxiang, Zhejiang Province, the hometown of Mr. Mao Dun.

Recently, a 30-year-old Ms. Zhu from Guangzhou developed fever, chills, weakness in her limbs, and coughed up yellow sputum. She originally thought it was a common cold, but she didn&#39;t get better. After a bronchoscopy, it was discovered that it was &quot;mycoplasma pneumonia.&quot; After targeted anti-infection He was discharged after improvement after treatment. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;She has an inexplicable high fever that persists and cannot be relieved by ordinary treatments&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;30-year-old Ms. Zhu is usually in good health, but she suddenly developed a fever recently. The maximum body temperature was 39.8°C, accompanied by chills, chills, and weakness in the limbs. She went to the hospital for treatment. After the doctor gave her ibuprofen to reduce fever and cephalosporins to fight infections, her symptoms were not significantly relieved. She then coughed up yellow and white sticky sputum that was difficult to cough up, especially at night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, Ms. Zhu came to the outpatient department of the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine of the Second Provincial Hospital to seek treatment. Dr. He Yaowei discovered through chest CT examination that she had an infectious lesion in the lower lobe of her right lung, so she was admitted to the hospital to further improve the examination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The doctor found through bronchoscopy that there was a large amount of yellow-white sticky sputum in Ms. Zhu&#39;s right lower lung bronchus. Through rapid etiology testing, &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot; was discovered. In other words, Ms. Zhu suffered from the recently popular &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In view of her situation, the doctor gave her levofloxacin for targeted anti-infection and symptomatic support treatment such as cough and phlegm reduction. Ms. Zhu quickly improved and was discharged. &lt;span>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/0c6bbfe3c842916de7086c6ad38f2062.jpeg&quot; border=&quot; 0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;366&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/0c6bbfe3c842916de7086c6ad38f2062.jpeg&quot; data -key=&quot;258779&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chest CT before treatment: Multiple small flakes and patchy increased density can be seen in the lower lobe of the right lung , the density is uneven, the boundary is blurred, patchy consolidation shadows can be seen, and air bronchial shadows can be seen within them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/2a7c361a222986c53f627af6426d6189.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;376&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/2a7c361a222986c53f627af6426d6189.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258778&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Thorax CT after treatment: Multiple small flakes and patches of increased density in the lower lobe of the original right lung were significantly less dense than before. light. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Mycoplasma pneumoniae is also an important causative agent of adult pneumonia&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Sun Ruilin, director and chief physician of the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine of the Second Provincial Hospital, explained that mycoplasma pneumonia is Acute pulmonary infection mainly caused by interstitial lesions caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae is significantly different from pneumonia caused by common bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae in clinical manifestations. Therefore, it is clinically distinguished from Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia pneumoniae and acute pneumonia. Pneumonia caused by other atypical pathogens such as grammaticis is collectively referred to as &quot;primary atypical pneumonia&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The current epidemiological survey results of multiple adult community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in China show that Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae are important pathogens of adult CAP in my country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to reports, the incubation period of mycoplasma pneumonia is 1 to 3 weeks, and the onset is diverse. Most patients only have low fever and fatigue, and some patients may have sudden high fever accompanied by obvious headache and myalgia. and nausea and other systemic symptoms of poisoning. The most prominent respiratory symptoms are dry cough, which often lasts for more than 4 weeks, is often accompanied by obvious sore throat, occasionally chest pain, and blood in sputum. In a few severe cases, respiratory failure may occur, manifesting as respiratory distress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the non-respiratory symptoms, earache, measles-like or scarlet fever-like rash are more common, and a few patients may be accompanied by gastroenteritis, pericarditis, myocarditis, meningoencephalitis, myelitis, and hemolysis. anemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, arthritis and hepatitis, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having few positive signs in the lungs and obvious imaging manifestations are important features of mycoplasma pneumonia. The lesions are mostly cloud-like patchy infiltrates with blurred edges and low density, radiating from the hilum to the peripheral lung fields. When the lung parenchyma is involved, large consolidation shadows may also appear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Quinols and tetracyclines are the drugs of choice for adults with mycoplasma pneumonia&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to reports, commonly used drugs for the treatment of mycoplasma pneumonia include macrolides, fluoroquinolones and Tetracyclines and macrolide antibiotics (such as azithromycin and clarithromycin) are currently the drugs of choice for the treatment of mycoplasma pneumonia in children. Quinolones and tetracyclines are the drugs of choice for adults with mycoplasma pneumonia. However, there are also mycoplasma pneumoniae and macrolide antibiotics. Lactone antibiotics are resistant, so the clinical selection should be based on the individual situation of the patient. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Will mycoplasma pneumonia cause &quot;white lung&quot;? A small number of mycoplasma pneumonias invade a wide range of lesions or have poor mucus drainage, involving the bronchi, alveoli, and interstitium of the lungs, causing &quot;atelectasis&quot; and even &quot;white lungs&quot; on imaging. Through effective anti-infection, expectoration, and shooting, Back and bronchoscopy treatment and other methods can cure the disease in a short time, and most patients have a good prognosis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Doctors remind that Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection can occur throughout the year, especially in late summer, autumn and winter, when the incidence is high. The main sources of infection are patients and carriers, which are mainly spread through air droplets, such as coughing and sneezing. Preschool and school-age children and adolescents over 5 years old are at high risk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The preventive measures for mycoplasma pneumonia mainly include: ① Stay away from the source of infection, regularly open windows indoors for ventilation, and it is recommended to wear a mask when going to crowded and closed places. ② Perform good hand hygiene, wash hands frequently with soap (hand sanitizer) and running water, or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer to wipe your hands. ③Eat more fresh vegetables and fruits, drink enough water, get enough sleep, and exercise moderately to enhance immunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Ruilin, director and chief physician of the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine of the Second Provincial Hospital, reminded that during the period of high incidence of respiratory infectious diseases, if you have upper respiratory tract infection symptoms such as cough and fever, it is recommended to seek medical treatment as soon as possible to find out the cause. Treat in a targeted manner and do not take medicine on your own to delay the condition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[体验“人生的旷野”后，两位985大学生选择回归国企和考研]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260901]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 05/14/ZJx5I7atgzPCjqiRvBFQtetVpSN3VGDPyg6VvrzP.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2449&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/05/14/ZJx5I7atgzPCjqiRvBFQtetVpSN3VGDPyg 6VvrzP. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;234068&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;>;Click to play this podcast↑&lt;/span>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;Every year during the school recruitment season, we can hear different employment stories of college students.

This bilateral exercise is the first joint exercise since the &quot;Reciprocal Access Agreement&quot; between the two countries officially came into effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A week ago, the fifth &quot;2+2&quot; meeting between Japan and the UK&#39;s foreign ministers and defense ministers was held face-to-face after a lapse of five years. In a joint statement issued after the talks, the two sides made it clear that they would increase the frequency of joint exercises. In addition, Japan will also provide cooperation with the United Kingdom in dispatching an aircraft carrier strike group to the Indo-Pacific in 2025. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Providing cooperation for the deployment of British aircraft carriers to the Indo-Pacific is just the latest step in deepening defense cooperation between Japan and countries outside the Asia-Pacific region. At present, Japan is promoting the joint development of next-generation fighter aircraft with the United Kingdom and Italy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan not only extended military cooperation invitations to European countries, but also played diplomatic cards in Southeast Asia. Previously, from November 3 to 5, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida visited the Philippines and Malaysia for the first time. Since the beginning of this year, the Kishida government has frequently visited Southeast Asia, covering almost 10 ASEAN member states. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Japan&#39;s efforts to win over countries in and outside the Asia-Pacific region such as the United Kingdom, France, Australia, and the Philippines are nothing more than wanting to revisit its old dream of the Russo-Japanese War and seek more interests for itself. While the United States continues to promote its Indo-Pacific strategy &#39;, and in the context of great power competition, relevant countries have also followed suit, trying to get a share of the regional game.&quot; Teng Jianqun, director of the Diplomatic Research Center of Hunan Normal University, told Southern Weekend reporters that in the context of multipolarization of international politics and global economicization, At the moment, Japan is trying to win over a large number of countries to stir up trouble in the Asia-Pacific. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 9, the spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in the UK responded to the erroneous remarks about China in the UK-Japan “2+2” joint statement, saying, “China has indisputable territorial sovereignty and maritime rights in the East China Sea and South China Sea. rights and interests. China will unswervingly safeguard its sovereignty and rights and interests, and firmly oppose relevant countries to sow relations between regional countries and create confrontation and confrontation. If the UK and Japan really want to become responsible countries, they should stop fanning the flames and stirring up trouble everywhere. Do things that contribute to regional peace and stability.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/E8VmoXNPlqgtjxiaGlfabmI7LvYMgX0hrypTsScd.jpg&quot; border =&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1700&quot; height=&quot;1133&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/E8VmoXNPlqgtjxiaGlfabmI7LvYMgX0hrypTsScd.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258739&quot; >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On January 11, 2023, local time, London, England, British Prime Minister Sunak (right) and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in London Towers sign defense agreement. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Winning over&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On November 7, Fumio Kishida met with the US Secretary of State at his official residence. Lincoln talks, exchanged views on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and confirmed that the two sides will cooperate on related issues. The day before, Blinken had just concluded his &quot;whirlwind diplomacy&quot; in the Middle East and arrived in Japan to attend the Group of Seven (G7) foreign ministers&#39; meeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The G7 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting, held in Tokyo from November 7th to 8th, was the last offline meeting hosted by Japan during its tenure as the G7 Presidency. During the meeting, Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa held talks with the foreign ministers of Canada, Germany and other member states, and took the opportunity to hold 95-minute consultations with the British Foreign Minister and Defense Minister. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In talks with defense ministers from various countries, the concept of a &quot;free and open Indo-Pacific&quot; was frequently mentioned by Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Japan&#39;s reaffirmation of the &#39;Indo-Pacific Concept&#39; through the G7 Foreign Ministers&#39; Meeting is just a rehash of old tunes with nothing new. What really deserves attention is Japan&#39;s gradual advancement in implementation.&quot; China Institute of International Studies Tang Qifang, associate researcher at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, analyzed this to a Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2022, the Japanese government adopted three security documents: the revised &quot;National Security Strategy&quot;, &quot;National Defense Strategy&quot; and &quot;Defense Force Preparation Plan&quot;, which not only clearly stated that it must have counterattack capabilities, but also emphasized that While taking the Japan-U.S. alliance as the foundation, we will deepen cooperation with so-called &quot;friendly countries that share values&quot; and strive to realize the concept of a &quot;free and open Indo-Pacific.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Less than a month after the &quot;Three Security Documents&quot; were released, Japan and the United Kingdom signed a &quot;Reciprocal Access Agreement&quot;, allowing both sides to conduct larger-scale and more complex military exercises on each other&#39;s territory. At this point, the United Kingdom has become the only European country that can conduct bilateral military exercises on Japanese territory, and is also the second country to sign this agreement with Japan after Australia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;After the promulgation of the new security strategy, Japan&#39;s defense policy has shifted from defensive to offensive, and the weapons and equipment, combat posture, and troop deployment of the Japanese Self-Defense Force have also changed from defensive to offensive.&quot; Teng Jianqun pointed out, &quot;The signing of the Reciprocal Access Agreement means that the relationship between Japan and relevant countries is entering a paramilitary alliance. The Japanese Self-Defense Forces can use this to go out and send troops to the United Kingdom and Australia to achieve the so-called &#39;national normalcy&#39; in a roundabout way.&quot; At the same time, Japan also wants to take the opportunity to release its military production capacity and accelerate the entry of weapons and equipment into the international market.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to linking up with countries outside the Asia-Pacific region, the Philippines has also become a key target for Japan to try to win over. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 3, Fumio Kishida arrived in the Philippines and held talks with Philippine President Marcos. In Manila, Fumio Kishida delivered his first speech to the Philippine Congress. In his speech, Kishida Fumio praised that bilateral relations between Japan and the Philippines have entered a &quot;golden age.&quot; At the same time, Japan and the Philippines also reached a consensus on launching negotiations on the Reciprocal Access Agreement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The targets chosen by Japan are all core members of the US military alliance. Australia is known as the US&#39;s &#39;Southern Anchor&#39; in the Asia-Pacific region, and the UK is its core ally in Europe.&quot; Tang Qifang pointed out, &quot;Although the Philippines is weak, the new President Marcos has tilted his foreign policy toward the United States after taking office. The United States is trying to turn it into a sharp thorn wedged in the South China Sea.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Linkage&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Japan is not only &quot;casting a wide net&quot; on the road to expanding its &quot;paramilitary alliance&quot;, but also continues to promote joint military exercises with relevant countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japanese media reported that the goal of the &quot;2+2&quot; talks between Britain and Japan is to enhance military coordination and interoperability by holding &quot;more frequent and more complex military exercises.&quot; After the signing of the Reciprocal Access Agreement, the first joint military exercise between Japan and Britain is on the way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, during the meeting of the G7 foreign ministers, the United States dispatched two aircraft carriers, the USS Ronald Reagan and USS Vinson, and the Japanese helicopter carrier USS Hyuga to conduct joint military exercises in the Philippine Sea. Rear Adm. Carlos Sadillo, commander of the U.S. Navy&#39;s First Aircraft Carrier Strike Group, pointed out that the exercise was designed to &quot;demonstrate how the United States and Japan can quickly respond to crises and interoperate and coordinate.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Australia, the Japan Air Self-Defense Force is seeking to normalize military deployment. Japan plans to station F-35, F-15 and F-2 fighter jets at air bases in Australia as early as fiscal 2024, with each deployment lasting several months. Japanese media pointed out that there is no clear legal basis for dispatching permanent troops to Australia or providing security assistance when necessary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Reciprocal Access Agreement facilitates joint military operations between Japan and Britain and Australia, and the same equipment purchased from the United States provides a sufficient platform for mutual integration and interoperability.&quot; Military Expert Wang Qunhuai told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2020, the United States approved the sale of 105 F-35 fighter jets to Japan. Adding the 42 previously purchased, Japan will have a total of 147 F-35 fighter jets. Australia and the United Kingdom are also &quot;die-hard fans&quot; of F-35 fighters and have ordered a total of 210 F-35 fighters from the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, in 2023, the United States successively agreed to sell hundreds of &quot;Tomahawk&quot; cruise missiles to Australia and Japan to enhance its naval long-range strike capabilities. It is worth mentioning that the United States has always been very cautious about the export of &quot;Tomahawk&quot; missiles. Prior to this, Britain was the only country besides the United States to possess this type of missile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In fact, the sale of weapons and equipment is an important tool for the United States to strengthen alliance relationships. The more American equipment is used, the deeper the relevant countries will be tied to the United States, and the more military sovereignty concessions will inevitably be made.&quot; Analysis by Wang Qunhuai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan’s military assistance to the Philippines came more directly. &quot;The Kishida government not only wants to provide money and equipment, but also tries to send troops to the Philippines.&quot; Tang Qifang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During his visit to Manila, Fumio Kishida sent a &quot;maritime gift package&quot; to the Philippines. According to a senior Japanese government official on November 3, Japan will provide five sets of fixed coast surveillance radars to the Philippines. This is the first time Japan has provided defense equipment to a foreign country under this mechanism since it established the &quot;Government Security Capability Strengthening Support&quot; (OSA) framework in April. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In the past, Japan focused on relying on &#39;government development assistance&#39; (ODA) and using economic diplomacy to expand its international influence, but now it has turned to improving the security capabilities of recipient countries.&quot; Tang Qifang pointed out, &quot;Japan It is hollowing out the peaceful constitution step by step, trying to transform from an economic power to a military and political power.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Team formation&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The interviewed experts and scholars told Southern Weekend reporters that Japan and the United Kingdom , the Philippines and other countries inside and outside the Asia-Pacific region &quot;form a circle&quot; and actively carry out defense cooperation, each getting what they need and utilizing each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2016, then Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and proposed the &quot;Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy&quot; for the first time in the joint communiqué. &quot;Since then, Japan has continued to promote this proposition in diplomatic settings, intending to cooperate with the United States in enhancing its intervention capabilities in the East China Sea, South China Sea and even the Asia-Pacific region, and to demonstrate its presence and enhance its international status and influence.&quot; Tang Qifang pointed out . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Tang Qifang’s view, Japan’s continuous breach of red lines in defense policy is inseparable from the acquiescence and connivance of the United States. &quot;The United States expects Japan to act as a &#39;pawn&#39; in the Asia-Pacific and help it reduce its burden and pressure. Japan also hopes to vigorously develop its military power and pursue becoming a military and political power. Although the interests of the two sides are different, the strategic goals are basically the same.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;The United Kingdom, Australia and other countries also have their own plans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;After Brexit, the UK has become an &#39;outcast&#39; in Europe. Based on geopolitical considerations, the UK hopes to use Japan as a &#39;bridgehead&#39; to strengthen its military deployment in the Asia-Pacific and highlight its status and From the perspective of business interests, the UK attaches great importance to the economic vitality of the Asia-Pacific region.&quot; Teng Jianqun analyzed that this is also the main reason why European and Asia-Pacific countries are willing to cooperate with Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as March 2021, the British government released &quot;Global Britain in the Era of Competition: A Comprehensive Assessment of Security, Defense, Development and Foreign Policy&quot;, which pointed out for the first time that the UK&#39;s global strategy must move towards the &quot;Indo-Pacific&quot; &quot;region&quot; tilt, and in May of that year dispatched the most advanced &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; aircraft carrier strike group to the Indo-Pacific region for the first time to conduct so-called &quot;freedom of navigation&quot; operations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the British aircraft carrier&#39;s &quot;global journey&quot; did not go smoothly. Two destroyers accidentally separated from the formation. In September 2023, the British Navy&#39;s &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; aircraft carrier conducted joint patrols with allies along the coast of Norway and the North Atlantic. Due to the significant reduction in the number of British Air Force fighter jets, the British aircraft carrier, which can normally carry about 30 F-35B fighter jets, only carries 8 fighter jets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The wish of &#39;Global Britain&#39; is very good, but Britain is no longer the &#39;Empire on which the sun never sets&#39; in the past. Whether its strength can match its ambitions is still a question. And the Philippines is not only weak in strength. On the other hand, the determination to follow the United States is not as strong as that of Japan, Britain and Australia.&quot; Tang Qifang pointed out, &quot;It remains to be seen how important the relevant countries can play in the so-called &#39;Indo-Pacific strategy&#39;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Facts As a die-hard ally of the United States, Japan is not willing to become a &quot;tool&quot; of the United States and still hopes to regain its autonomy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2022, the United Kingdom, Japan and Italy announced that they would jointly develop a common airframe for next-generation fighter aircraft. The three countries are determined to integrate their respective capabilities in cutting-edge air combat technologies such as stealth and high-tech sensors. By 2035 The latest fighter jet was launched years ago. It is worth noting that this is the first time since World War II that Japan has participated in a joint research and development program for advanced fighter aircraft that does not include the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, Japan has specially set aside funds in its defense budget for fiscal year 2024 and plans to develop an air-to-air missile for use by the next-generation fighter aircraft jointly developed by the three countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Japan does not want to put all its eggs in the American basket, nor does it want to hand over its military industry dividends to the United States. However, historically speaking, no matter what kind of cooperation Japan adopts, it will It is difficult to break through the restrictions imposed by the United States in military production. This time is no exception. The United States will try its best to block it and strangle its research and development plans, including Japan&#39;s new generation fighter aircraft, in the cradle.&quot; Teng Jianqun concluded, &quot;Japan&#39;s Strategic independence has always been difficult to escape from the constraints of the Japan-US alliance framework.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[9.9元价格战背后：前三季近万家咖啡企业倒闭，有独立咖啡馆营业额不够发工资]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260913]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Lin Li runs an independent coffee shop on Beijing Road in Guangzhou. This shop has been open for more than three years and is currently experiencing difficulties. During this period, the monthly turnover could not cover employee wages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Li told reporters from Nandu·Wancaishe that this year there has been a wave of store openings in the coffee industry. Some people who do not know how to open stores blindly open stores and occupy market space. Professional community coffee shops have attracted customers who know how to taste fine coffee. , and the spatial experience originally provided by independent coffee shops has become no longer rare, because chain coffee shops are also setting up large stores. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The chain coffee brands with larger store areas have taken away the in-store customers, and the community coffee shops along the street have taken away the in-store and take-out coffee cups. In short, now coffee shops The density is too high.&quot; Lin Li lamented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/d33e2d4d182d5e6ae80bb77a5591e6b9.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;450&quot; ​​data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/d33e2d4d182d5e6ae80bb77a5591e6b9.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258785&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since this year, Coffee chains are making every effort to open stores. Recently, Cudi Coffee, which was founded just one year ago, announced that it has more than 6,000 stores, setting a new record for domestic coffee stores; Luckin announced that it has more than 13,000 stores and predicts that it will open 15,000 stores by the end of this year; Starbucks is also speeding up Expanding stores, it &quot;opens a new store every 9 hours in China&quot;; Manner, a specialty coffee brand founded in Shanghai, is also running wild. Yesterday (October 30), its number of stores officially exceeded 1,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, amidst the craze for coffee, a large number of coffee shops failed to survive this year. Statistics from the third-party platform Kamen show that in the first nine months of 2023, the number of newly registered coffee-related companies was approximately 45,000, an increase of 74.10% over the same period last year, and 9,825 coffee companies were deregistered, with the number of cancellations increasing by 58.95% year-on-year. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, reporters from Nandu Bay Financial News visited a number of independent cafes, trying to understand whether they can survive the &quot;9.9 yuan cup of coffee&quot; storm and the increasing density of coffee shops. , what do they rely on to survive? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Cafes are everywhere, and the 9.9 yuan price war continues&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;Nearly 10,000 coffee companies closed down in the first nine months&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Lin Li works as a manager at an independent coffee shop on Beijing Road in Guangzhou Store manager, this store has three floors.

There are large floor-to-ceiling windows on the side near the corner, allowing you to have a panoramic view of the outside scenery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The coffee products sold in the store include classic American coffee, milk coffee, special coffee and hand-brewed specialty coffee, with prices ranging from 20 to 100 yuan. There are also some baked simple meals for single consumption. The amount is about 50 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/4b6280e9848604abf3a19a02f5a9a56c.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;1067&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/4b6280e9848604abf3a19a02f5a9a56c.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258786&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Li told Nandu ·Wancaishe reporter, &quot;There used to be many customers on weekdays, and the daily turnover could reach tens of thousands of yuan.&quot; It is located in a tourist area, and it is &quot;extremely busy&quot; on weekends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, since the adjustment of epidemic prevention and control measures this year, the operation of the store has turned from profit to loss. In this regard, Lin Li said that he originally thought that there would be more customers this year, and he also vigorously promoted some creative and special products at the beginning of the year to attract traffic, but the effect was not good. &quot;Currently, the turnover is only two to three thousand yuan on weekdays and tens of thousands of yuan on weekends.&quot; However, after deducting the high cost of 65,000 yuan in shop rent, water, electricity and raw materials, there is still more than 10,000 yuan left, which is not even enough to pay employees&#39; wages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although it is located in a popular tourist destination, tourists do not help its business much. During the National Day this year, boss Lin Li visited nearby coffee shops. Although the streets were crowded, there were many empty seats in the coffee shops. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Li told reporters an observation: Foreign tourists are basically adults with children, and they do not have the habit of drinking coffee. On the contrary, Guangzhou locals did not travel abroad last year and came to coffee shops to kill time. There are more people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to changes in consumer customer groups, the increasing number of coffee shops on the streets has also impacted store business. Lin Li bluntly said that there has been a wave of store openings in the coffee industry this year. Some people who do not know how to open stores blindly opened stores, squeezing the market space. “The chain coffee brands with larger store areas have taken away the customers who come to the store, and the community coffee shops along the street have taken away the customers. The number of coffee cups sold in stores and for takeaways has increased. In short, the density of coffee shops is too high now.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The density of coffee shops in the Beijing Road business district is indeed increasing. Nanduwan Financial News reporter learned through Dianping that there are about 200 coffee shops within 2 kilometers of the Beijing Road business district. As of October 27, about 30 coffee shops have opened in the past three months, that is, every Within three days, a coffee shop opened in the Beijing Road business district. Among them, there are many well-known chain large space coffee shops such as Lavasa Coffee, store by.jpg, M Stand, and Starbucks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since this year, chain coffee brands have indeed been making great efforts to open stores. For example, Kudi’s stores have exceeded 6,000, and Luckin’s stores have exceeded 13,000. Statistics from Kamen show that in the first nine months of 2023, the number of newly registered coffee companies was approximately 45,000, an increase of 74.10% compared with the same period last year. At the same time, many coffee shops have fallen in the coffee wave. Kamen data shows that in the first nine months of 2023, 9,825 coffee companies have been canceled, and the number of cancellations has increased by 58.95% year-on-year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to intensive store openings, leading coffee chain brand Luckin Kudi Tims has also successively launched promotions of 9.9 yuan/cup or 8.8 yuan/cup, lowering the selling price of coffee in order to seize the market share. customer. Although there is a big difference between the customer base of low-price coffee and the customer base of independent coffee shops, the impression that a cup of coffee only costs 9.9 yuan is still engraved in the hearts of many consumers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/b5d8d224b36f1aa66eb98e4984ecbc14.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;1067&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/b5d8d224b36f1aa66eb98e4984ecbc14.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258781&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Li revealed, A customer once was surprised when he saw the price list after entering the store, &quot;Americano coffee actually costs more than 20 yuan.&quot; However, Lin Li believes that &quot;six or seven years ago, the Americano and latte we drank were more than 20 yuan a cup.&quot; Yes, this is the normal price.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bill, another independent cafe operator, also encountered customers who were confused about the price at his store. Bill thought, &quot;American and American cuisine cost more than 20 yuan. The nine-yuan American style uses different coffee beans, and the taste is different, so the price is naturally different.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, due to the competitive pressure brought by the store opening wave and price wars, Bill&#39;s store coffee Some price adjustments have been made. For example, the price of iced Americano coffee has been reduced to 20 yuan, and many stores have launched a beverage promotion of &quot;42% off in the morning and 32% off in the afternoon on weekdays&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Reduce the store area and shift towards high-end customers&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;Independent cafes are also planning to change&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Compared with the numerous stores that are still struggling with losses, Bill will The coffee shop moved from a shop along the street in Guangzhou to a community, and its store went from losing money to being able to continue operating. Although the operating area of ​​Bill&#39;s store has only been reduced by about 10 square meters, the rent burden has been cut in half, down to four digits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bill is a coffee fan with more than 20 years of coffee experience. Out of interest, he opened his first coffee shop in 2019. However, the rent of this shop is high due to the location where it is located. , but the flow of people is not much, and it has been affected many times by the epidemic before, so it is not profitable. Last year, Bill accidentally saw a store in the community for rent, so he closed the old store and started over. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The new coffee shop covers an area of ​​about 20 square meters, and most of the coffee drinks sold in the store are hand-brewed coffee. Bill manages it by himself because costs have dropped. According to his estimate, he can run the business with only 300 yuan a day. On the day when a reporter from Nandu Bay Financial News visited, he sold several hundred yuan of coffee beans and several hundred yuan of coffee drinks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ming Yue, who lives in Guangzhou, also wanted to open a coffee shop. Before opening the shop, she did some research. Mingyue found that although there were many coffee shops in Guangzhou, most of them had different decoration styles and menus. The drinks on the menu are all very similar. “As soon as I look at the menu, I can imagine what this cup of coffee will look like and taste like.” Moreover, what confuses Mingyue even more is that even though there are so many coffee shops, when she wants to When drinking a cup of hand-brewed coffee, she didn&#39;t know where to consume it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/90b868772cf40aeccd71515e58371d9d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;450&quot; ​​data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/90b868772cf40aeccd71515e58371d9d.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258782&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, last year , Mingyue opened an independent cafe in the Yanyun West Community of Huifu East Road, Guangzhou. In order to distinguish it from most coffee shops in the market, she positioned the shop as a high-end cafe targeting high-end customers. The cafe is located in a quiet community. It has a two-story store with an area of ​​about 200 square meters, a monthly rent of 25,000 yuan, and three employees. The price of coffee products in the store ranges from 38 to 168 yuan, and competition-level premium hand-brewed coffee is also available. However, the supply of such products is small, and the pricing depends on the type of beans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One year after opening the store, Mingyue confessed to a reporter from Nandu Bay Financial News that the coffee shop business is not easy. Not many people know about the newly opened store. It is a process of slowly accumulating word-of-mouth and popularity. , until last month, the store was still losing money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the situation has been slowly improving. The differentiation of positioning and the ability to brew coffee have helped her a lot. Mingyue said, &quot;We suffered the most when we first opened, because at that time Severely affected by the epidemic... Only half of this month (October) has passed and we have recovered our capital. This month is a steady profit.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Independent cafes survive on high-quality beans&lt;/h4 >; &lt;h4>;But it may be difficult for novices to identify them&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After visiting these independent cafes, reporters from Nandu Bay Financial News learned that the reason why there are so many coffee shops in operation is difficult, in addition to the location where they are located. In addition to the problem and the influence of coffee competition, one of the problems is that the target group positioning is not clear enough. His customer group includes white-collar workers, freelancers, and office workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why stores like Mingyue and Ah Bill can survive is that in addition to working hard to accumulate regular customers in terms of cost and positioning, it is also very important that they have good quality and cost-effectiveness in the supply chain. A channel for coffee beans that are high quality and in line with market tastes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/d27afb385794723e0854e23204cf3d24.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;712&quot; height= &quot;534&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/d27afb385794723e0854e23204cf3d24.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258784&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Coffee beans sold at Mingyue store. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ming Yue attaches great importance to the selection of coffee beans. The positioning of her coffee shop is to produce competition-level specialty coffee, and she can often get some micro-batch specialty beans. Mingyue told a reporter from Nandu Bay Financial News that she drank more than a thousand beans from April this year to now before finally deciding to purchase a dozen beans. &quot;Finding beans can represent many things, and the struggle to make specialty coffee is actually to compete with your ability to select products.&quot; Her feeling is that being able to find good coffee beans will benefit the store&#39;s customer base - those who know the goods and are willing to spend money. For customers who have money to drink expensive beans, it is very competitive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to high-quality coffee beans, another key point in product selection is to allow customers to drink coffee with high cost performance. Mingyue is trying to improve the price-performance ratio of the coffee in the store as much as possible. For example, the Americano coffee sold in its store is priced at 68 yuan. It uses green label Geisha beans. &quot;Customers who know the product will think that I sell it very cheaply when they see it in the store.&quot; The price of this bean in the market is 88 yuan. Yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/9bb65a681121dcf9ca50165b21d30b73.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;1200&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/9bb65a681121dcf9ca50165b21d30b73.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258783&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to passing high quality In addition to providing coffee drinks, selling coffee beans is also the main way for some independent cafes to make money. Some cafes will buy green coffee beans and roast them themselves, making them into cooked coffee beans before selling them, but the coffee beans are usually sold to regular customers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nandu·Wancaishe reporter learned from many coffee practitioners that, excluding all processing costs, the selling price of cooked beans is about three times that of green beans, and a green coffee bean sells for 100 -120 yuan/kg, so converted, the selling price of this cooked coffee beans is about 300 yuan/kg, and the specific situation will be different in each coffee shop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Bill, he would rather sell coffee beans than sell coffee. Bill roughly estimated that 50% of his store&#39;s turnover comes from selling coffee beans, and 50% comes from consumption in the store. &quot;The people who buy beans are mainly regular customers.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bill’s coffee menu has a full three-page hand-brewed coffee bean list. In addition, he also took out more than a dozen beans from the cabinet that were not on the bean list and introduced them to reporters in detail. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/7567eda950cc92f0e34c20047344c3c3.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;1067&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/7567eda950cc92f0e34c20047344c3c3.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258788&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While making Regarding coffee, Bill doesn’t have many coffee equipment in his shop. An Italian machine is his main tool for making American coffee and milk coffee. Bill said frankly, “When I opened the store, I planned not to sell coffee drinks, but I decided to do it after thinking about it.” This decision was the right one. Half of Bill’s current sales volume in the store still comes from these coffee drinks. “These are what we use.” To stabilize the basic market.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bill sells hand-brewed coffee, with prices ranging from more than 30 yuan a cup to 100 yuan a cup. He said that the price of beans is directly linked to the quality of coffee. Expensive beans will have obviously rich and lovely flavors, such as bergamot, lemon, and tropical fruits. Cheap beans have a relatively bland flavor and are priced low. Just expect that the flavor of this cup of coffee will not be that rich. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ming Yue’s store also sells coffee beans. 70% of her turnover comes from in-store consumption and 30% from selling beans. However, Mingyue said that since the store has only been open for a short period of time, it has not accumulated many regular customers, and there will be greater room for growth in this part of the business in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/d892ab5957be5431c882bca384a1a444.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;1067&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/d892ab5957be5431c882bca384a1a444.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258787&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The prize Mingyue won in the coffee competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the ability to obtain high-quality coffee beans has helped Bill and Mingyue a lot, because the quality of coffee beans varies and there are many supply channels, it is not easy for novices to understand the process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Li calculated an account for the reporter and opened a cafe. In addition to investing about 300,000 yuan in decoration and equipment in the early stage of opening the store, the price range of coffee beans on the market is very wide - raw materials. Beans range from 30 yuan/kg to tens of thousands of yuan/kg, and cooked coffee beans range from 80 yuan/pound to tens of thousands of yuan/pound. “It is difficult for a layman to tell the true price of a bean. As for what price it should be sold in a store, I don’t know the beans... and there are many companies that specialize in coffee shop opening planning. If people who don’t know the business buy beans directly from them, they will basically make money.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Conclusion: &lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;Consumers have more choices&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;The era of coffee segmentation may have begun&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As coffee competition becomes increasingly fierce, the practitioners of these independent cafes They are also thinking about where to go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After discussing with his boss, Lin Li plans to terminate the store&#39;s operations in November this year and wants to reopen it in a smaller store. As for the store&#39;s future competitive direction, he said he is still thinking about it, &quot;Maybe it depends on how to make the products more refined, instead of just making Italian, milk coffee, special blends, and hand-brewed everything.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/f7624557efce35d6d08cf44daf90061e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;1067&quot; data-src=&quot; //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/f7624557efce35d6d08cf44daf90061e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258789&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Those who are in it know best how fast the coffee market is changing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ming Yue is glad that she initially targeted the high-end specialty coffee track. Mingyue revealed that a year ago, a senior told her that opening a chain of popular coffee shops was the most profitable trend, but just recently, the senior told her that his chain of coffee shops could no longer continue, and was replaced by Luckin and others. The big chain coffee brands are losing competition, and he needs to find a new outlet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mingyue has seen that the coffee market is gradually segmented, and some customers’ tastes are already “very advanced”, such as its previously launched Combo product (ie “one bean, more”). It&#39;s exactly what the customers suggested. Mingyue said frankly, &quot;We need to be very precise in a very narrow field, rather than doing everything. Customers have already learned how to choose. If we do it seriously, there is still a lot of room for development.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mingyue&#39;s The plan is to wait until this hand-brew store can make a stable profit before opening a new store specializing in special blends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;span>;(At the request of the interviewee, Lin Li and Bill are pseudonyms)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 19:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[果敢四大家族：这群地头蛇是怎么炼成的？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260889]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Rebel Alliance&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The so-called four major families are fighting in Kokang The rise of the region, from its beginning to its fame, has only happened in the past ten years. Among them, I have to mention the Bai family, which ranks first among the four major families. If it were not for the head of the Bai family, Bai Zhicheng, I am afraid that there would not be any existence of the four major families in the Kokang region. Now the political and business affairs in the Kokang Autonomous Region The relationship map comes entirely from Bai Suocheng&#39;s betrayal in 2009. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The eldest son of the Bai family, Bai Suocheng, is an authentic Kokang man. He was born on April 1, 1950 in Hongyan, Kokang, Myanmar. Since Peng Jiasheng established the &quot;Kokang People&#39;s Revolutionary Army&quot; in 1965 to fight guerrillas with the government forces, Bai Suocheng began to follow Peng Jiasheng. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Song, who had been a guard for Peng Jiasheng for many years, recalled: Bai Suocheng fought bravely in those days and was willing to use his brain, so he was promoted quickly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1967, Peng Jiasheng joined the Communist Party of Myanmar. During the People&#39;s Army of the Communist Party of Myanmar, Bai Soucheng was promoted step by step from soldier to battalion commander under Peng Jiasheng. In 1989, Peng Jiasheng led his troops to withdraw from the Communist Party of Myanmar and ceased war with the Myanmar government. The Myanmar government recognized the autonomous status of Kokang, and Peng Jiasheng served as the chairman of the Shan State First Special Administrative Region of Myanmar and the commander-in-chief of the Kokang National Democratic Alliance Army. At this time, Bai Suocheng was promoted by Peng Jiasheng to serve as deputy commander of the Kokang Allied Forces, becoming the veritable second-in-command of the Kokang Alliance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The famous Kokang &quot;88 Incident&quot; occurred in 2009. Bai Soucheng reached a private agreement with the Myanmar government forces, appointed himself chairman of the Kokang Autonomous Region, and united with the Myanmar government troops to merge with the Allied Forces loyal to Peng Jiasheng. . Peng Bu was defeated and fled away from home. With the support of the Myanmar government, Bai Suocheng became the leader of the Kokang region. This was the beginning of the era of the four major Kokang families. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The four major Kogang families established in 2009 are actually Bai, Wei, and Er Liu. Among them, Bai Suocheng of the Bai family, Wei Chaoren of the Wei family, and Liu Guoxi of the Liu family were all former members of Peng Jiasheng. People conspired with the Burmese government forces to expel Peng Jiasheng, just like the three families of Zhao, Wei, and Han who were divided into Jin. Liu Abao (Liu Zhengxiang) of the Second Liu has always been a pro-Myanmar government strong local force, so theoretically he is not a traitor to the Allied Forces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Bai Suocheng came to power, he changed Peng Jiasheng&#39;s policy towards the Myanmar government. During Peng Jiasheng&#39;s era, the Kokang area was completely independent of Myanmar, and government troops were not allowed to enter the Allied Defense Zone. Bai Socheng declared his obedience to the leadership of the Myanmar government and allowed Myanmar government troops to enter the Kokang Autonomous Region, and the local armed forces were reorganized into pro-government forces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/40zhgHxze9VBwBlEypc2k0byDSf1aipFbDa0AeuX.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;620&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/40zhgHxze9VBwBlEypc2k0byDSf1aipFbDa0AeuX.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258754&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color ; =&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Kokang Public Network/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Peng family left Kokang, although the Myanmar government nominally gained control of the Kokang area, the main ethnic groups in the area For the Han people in Myanmar (known as the Kokang ethnic group in Myanmar), the Myanmar government’s decrees still need to be implemented by the local powerful. Under this modern chieftain system, the four major families began to thrive in Kokang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Bai family, the largest family, has made the first bold move to surrender, so power is naturally indispensable. Not only did Bai Suocheng serve as the chairman of the Kokang Autonomous Region in 2009, his eldest son Bai Yingneng served as the party committee secretary of the Kokang Gongfa Party (the ruling party established by the military government) and served as the chairman of Baijia Industrial Yum Group. The second son Bai Yingcang serves as the deputy director of the Kokang Finance Bureau, the captain of the Kokang Militia Brigade, and the general manager of Yum Group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called Yum Group is actually a political and business industrial organization that has obtained the qualifications to operate monopoly industries such as gambling, entertainment, and real estate development in the Kokang area. The Kokang area is located in an inland mountainous area with harsh natural conditions and inconvenient transportation. Since the anti-drug era during the Peng Jiasheng era, the local pillar industries have been gambling and surrounding entertainment industries (prostitution), and the main target customers are Chinese tourists who share the same culture and ethnicity as Kokang . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Myanmar, gambling and other industries are actually illegal industries, but northern Myanmar is not under the direct jurisdiction of the central government of Myanmar, so these gray industries can flourish. The main source of income for the four major Kokang families also comes from such gray industries and related peripheral economic activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wei Chaoren, the second-ranked member of the Wei family among the four major families, once served as the commander of the First Brigade of the Northeast Military Region during the Burmese Communist Party. During Peng Jiasheng&#39;s rule in Kokang, he served as the chief of staff of the Kokang Allied Forces and was the third-in-command of the Allied Forces. After the establishment of the Kokang Autonomous Region, Wei Chaoren served as the leader of the political and legal system of the autonomous region and participated in the &quot;88 Incident&quot; that expelled Peng Jiasheng in 2009. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/BS6OERsyvFXUlEz3A3aWySgbbPFwsAGIFc45bJdd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/BS6OERsyvFXUlEz3A3aWySgbbPFwsAGIFc45bJdd.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258753&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 2022, Wei Chaoren (third from right) at home&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Kokang Dazhong.com/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;After becoming one of the four major families, Wei Chaoren also actively took the upper-level route. He served as a member of the Parliament of the Union of Myanmar and a member of the Kokang Autonomous Region Committee. He has always firmly controlled the political and legal system of the Kokang region. Wei Chaoren&#39;s third brother, Wei Huairen, serves as the commander of the Kokang Border Guard Battalion. He has a private armed force of 2,000 people and controls the police force in the Kokang area. Wei Chaoren&#39;s daughter Wei Rong is the chairman of Henry Group, which operates hotels, entertainment and tourism, real estate development, mineral development, gold and jewelry and other industries in Southeast Asia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relying on Wei Chaoren’s position in Myanmar’s political arena, Henry Group’s development has long gone beyond the Kokang region. It has a large number of hotels, casinos, finance, and jewelry businesses in Lower Myanmar, Cambodia, Wa State and other places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wei Rong is also good at using new media methods for publicity. Not only does she spend a lot of money to invite celebrities to endorse her, and she brands herself as a beautiful CEO and philanthropist, she also makes many Myanmar anchors famous, and promotes and recruits people to travel to northern Myanmar to work. ——The most famous among them is Internet celebrity Li Saigao. This person is an Internet celebrity anchor recruited by Henry Group in the Wa State. He claims to be a descendant of the expeditionary force. He is somewhat handsome in appearance. He plays and sings Chinese patriotic songs. Later, Exposed by netizens as an accomplice of a fraud group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Henry Group can be said to have created a model for gray industries to use social media, and it has also attracted many Chinese people’s attention to northern Myanmar. It is worth noting that Wei Chaoren’s eldest son Wei Qingtao has been captured by the Chinese police and publicly confessed via video. Wei Rong, who has always been high-profile, may have fled the Kokang region and temporarily avoided the limelight in Lower Myanmar or other Southeast Asian countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Guoxi of the Liu family is also an old subordinate of Peng Jiasheng, but he has been a civilian cadre during the Burmese Communist Party. He served as the Finance Minister of the Northern Bureau of the Burmese Communist Party, and was also an official in charge of finance and border trade in the Northeastern Military Region of the Burmese Communist Party. . During Peng Jiasheng&#39;s rule in Kokang, Liu was also a government official but did not hold military power. After the &quot;88 Incident&quot;, Liu Guoxi served as vice chairman of the Kokang Autonomous Region and was elected as a member of the National Council of the Union of Myanmar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/KvugCKzgBB7Orw4SCl1jRDNXs0w8QTeUsgr6kQuU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;721&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/KvugCKzgBB7Orw4SCl1jRDNXs0w8QTeUsgr6kQuU.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258752&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 2018, the Kokang Gongfa Party held a public meeting, and Liu Guoxi delivered a speech at the meeting&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Kokang Public Network/Photo)&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Liu Guoxi is an old subordinate of the Communist Party of Myanmar, the Kokang Allied Forces are less hostile to him because Liu has always been a government official in charge of finance. When Bai Socheng fought with the Kokang Allied Forces, This person was not involved in any fighting. Mr. Song, who was once a guard of Peng Jiasheng, also revealed to me: Liu did not have the blood debt of the Kokang Allied Forces in his hands. He was a civil servant and had no choice but to surrender to Lao Burma. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Guoxi passed away in 2020. His three sons and one daughter run mining, casino, hotel and other businesses in the Kokang area. Among them, the third son Liu Dehong is a member of the Kokang District Parliament. Although Liu Guoxi is regarded as one of the four major families, it is a relatively low-key one. Especially after Liu Guoxi&#39;s death, his children did not hold actual positions in the Kokang government. The influence of his family was not as good as that of Ming Dynasty, which had just been uprooted. Home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The only one of the four major families that is not directly related to Peng Jiasheng is the Liu family of Liu Abao (Zhengxiang). Liu Zhengxiang was originally the deputy head of Hongyan Township, Kokang, and used his status as head of the township to do business and founded a welfare company in 1992. Lai Group is said to be the richest man in Kokang. Its main business operations include cultural tourism, hotels, commerce, real estate, finance, etc., with more than 10,000 employees across Myanmar and Southeast Asia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/JWOm8W7PsWNX9VEiShuGQ2DtGw9wNrF2BNCmOKOB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;625&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/JWOm8W7PsWNX9VEiShuGQ2DtGw9wNrF2BNCmOKOB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258755&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 7, 2023, Liu Zhengxiang, director of the Kokang Autonomous Region Urban Construction Development Supervision and Management Committee, inspected road construction work&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Kokang Public Network /Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Zhengxiang is a model of both politics and business. On the one hand, he uses government relations to do business, and on the other hand, he uses commercial profits to manage government relations. He belongs to the most powerful family among the four major families in Lower Myanmar. A well-connected branch also has close ties with the Myanmar military. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, since Liu Abao did not participate in the rebellion against Peng Jiasheng, the Allied Forces did not have high hatred towards him. It is rumored that after the Kokang Allied Forces launched &quot;Operation 1027&quot; this time, they did not target Liu Abao, and Shortly after the war started, Liu Abao expressed his surrender and was willing to cooperate with China in clearing up his business involving electricity fraud. Other industries are still operating normally. It can be said that he is a typical chameleon businessman. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The Ming family came from behind&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;If we look at Ming Xuechang’s political and business influence in the Kokang area during his lifetime, the Ming family has long surpassed the Liu Guoxi family and established One of the powerful new entrants. However, this person has relatively junior qualifications and has always been considered low in the Kokang political and business circles. Therefore, the Ming family is not among the four major families that are generally mentioned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the Burmese Communist Party period, Ming Xuechang was just the correspondent of Zhao Ming, commander of the Northeast Military Region. Although the leader trusted him, his position was very low. When Peng Jiasheng was in power in Kokang, Ming Xuechang&#39;s highest position was only the deputy county magistrate of Kokang County. It can be said that he was still far from the core power circle of Kokang and was not a cadre who could directly report to Peng Jiasheng. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was not until the &quot;88 Incident&quot; in 2009 that Ming Xuechang followed Bai Socheng to defect to Peng Jiasheng and defected to the Myanmar government. After that, he was promoted to the vice chairman of the Kokang Autonomous Region and a member of the Shan State Parliament of Myanmar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is rumored that Ming Xuechang has a good relationship with the Myanmar government army. This man had very little experience in the military during the Kokang Allied Forces era, but he began to take control of the Kokang Autonomous Region Police Force after 2009.

It was not until his 69th birthday that many Hong Kong and Taiwan stars recorded VCRs to celebrate his birthday, and he became widely known on the Chinese Internet. Later, it was rumored that his eldest grandson Ming Guangzhong was admitted to Peking University (not true), and he became famous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/kEn6BvHJkmpDppX96cUCJ8cUqDWsPm7tHiRzu3aV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/kEn6BvHJkmpDppX96cUCJ8cUqDWsPm7tHiRzu3aV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258756&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 23, 2023, Ming Xuechang and his wife celebrated their 69th birthday&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Kokang Dazhong.com/Picture)&lt;/ span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Crouching Tiger Villa of the Ming Xuechang family is a notorious base for telecommunications fraud, and may be involved in cases of kidnapping, extortion, intentional injury or even killing of multiple Chinese citizens. The Ming family has also become the primary target of the Chinese police&#39;s crackdown on telecommunications fraud. After surrounding Laojie, the Kokang Allied Forces took the lead in launching an attack on the Ming family&#39;s territory, which became the last straw for the Ming family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the suicide of Ming Xuechang and the arrest of many people, it can be seen that the family’s political and business influence in the Kokang area has basically been reduced to zero. &lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Agent Politics&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of the political and business paths of the five major families, in addition to Except for Liu Abao, who is a businessman, the other four companies all grew rapidly after the Peng family members left during the &quot;88 Incident&quot; in 2009. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This has a lot to do with the special political environment in the Kokang region. Although the Myanmar government gained nominal control of the Kokang region in 2009, most of the local residents are not Bamar and have always been quite dissatisfied with the Myanmar government. Hostility, national identity is not strong. This is a common situation in non-Burmese areas in northern Myanmar after Myanmar’s independence, and the Myanmar government is well aware of this. In order to rule such areas at low cost, the Burmese government generally appoints local agents of their own ethnic origin as representatives of the Burmese regime. These agents thus obtain higher-than-normal political rights to a certain extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the past to the present, various gray and black industries have existed in Myanmar’s border ethnic areas, all caused by the local independent or semi-independent political status quo. This situation is not unique to Kokang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historically, in addition to telecommunications fraud, Myanmar&#39;s border areas also had a series of serious black and gray problems such as drug trade, illegal smuggling, protected wildlife trade, prostitution, and illegal gambling. Kokang is a typical example. Under the protection of the dual political and business identities of the five major families, the huge profits generated by his business empire enable him to obtain protection within the Myanmar government through corrupt means. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/wSDHIJ4OPByuFsuP6QRLBtUU3vJ0ZmNV82qku2YA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/wSDHIJ4OPByuFsuP6QRLBtUU3vJ0ZmNV82qku2YA.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258757&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Since September 2023, the public security agencies in Xishuangbanna, Pu&#39;er and other places in Yunnan have carried out border police law enforcement cooperation with relevant local law enforcement departments in Myanmar. A large number of overseas fraud dens have been successfully eradicated. A large number of telecommunications network fraud suspects were handed over to our side &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the Ministry of Public Security)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But they obviously underestimated the impact of international political pressure on own influence. Telecom fraud is not a phenomenon unique to the Kokang region. There are also a large number of telecom fraud parks in surrounding areas such as Wa State and Myawaddy. The Philippines, Cambodia, and Laos also had rampant telecom fraud businesses. However, with the trend of international cooperation to combat telecommunications fraud, such activities have begun to shrink significantly, and a large number of suspects involved in telecommunications fraud have been handed over to the police of relevant countries for processing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Wa State Autonomous Region, also in northern Myanmar, quickly responded to the call to crack down on electronic fraud. After raiding more than 40 industrial parks, it handed over more than 4,000 electronic fraudsters to the Chinese police. China has provided tens of thousands of computers and mobile phones used in the electronic fraud business, which contain millions of pieces of intelligence and evidence about the fraud group. It has even dismissed officials involved in electronic fraud in the Wa State area for investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this series of anti-email fraud storms of multi-national cooperation, the Kokang region has violated law enforcement actions and only provided a few hundred people to China in a symbolic manner. Under Myanmar&#39;s comprehensive crackdown on e-mail fraud, , and even plans to expand against the trend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/yuoxPEO6H3BM0dOJDaasqkuB5VI9UZtakYijObuf.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/yuoxPEO6H3BM0dOJDaasqkuB5VI9UZtakYijObuf.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258758&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In order to resolutely curb the high incidence of telecommunications network fraud crimes involving China in northern Myanmar, the Ministry of Public Security deployed the Yunnan public security agencies to strengthen border police cooperation and continue to carry out multiple rounds of crackdowns. The picture shows the fraud suspects handed over to us &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the Ministry of Public Security)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the criminal suspects in the Kokang area and even the entire Myanmar The reason why the telecom fraud business has expanded rapidly in recent years is because neighboring countries such as the Philippines, Cambodia, and Laos have cracked down on telecom fraud, which has led to a large number of practitioners fleeing from former &quot;telephone fraud centers&quot; such as Sihanoukville, Cambodia, to conduct business in northern Myanmar. After the Wa State and other surrounding areas cooperated with China in cracking down on e-mail fraud, Henry Group and Crouching Tiger Villa still had little luck. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although strong dragons will not suppress local snakes, it is another matter if local snakes take the initiative to cross the line and bite people and refuse to restrain themselves after being warned. After this reorganization, the political and business relations landscape in the Kokang region will be reshuffled again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 18:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一方提分手，另一方都应同意：或体面结束，或不受要挟]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260903]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;It is not uncommon for someone to break up when they are in a relationship. The question is, should I agree? My opinion is that when one party proposes a breakup, whether it is a real breakup or a breakup to coerce the other party into accepting their conditions, the other party should agree. 36Kr’s “2022 Chinese Couples Breakup Report” shows that more than 60% of girls break up first. We will use the woman to break up for analysis, but the opposite is true, and it also applies to the man to break up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some young netizens discovered an interesting phenomenon around them: when girls propose breaking up, boys basically agree. TA further said that because some girls like to use breakup as a means, but boys generally use breakup as the result. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We will discuss it on a case-by-case basis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first situation, a girl is serious about breaking up, but in the general perception of boys, breaking up is equivalent to announcing a breakup. You have informed me, so what if you don’t accept it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Besides, if you really want to break up, wouldn’t it be nice if the other party behaves decently and doesn’t keep pestering you? If one party wants to break up and the other party refuses to let go, it may lead to tragedy, which is what many people in love fear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I agree with the sentiment that &quot;breakups are serious.&quot; Breaking up is equivalent to the death of love. A person who cherishes life should naturally cherish feelings. He should not talk about &quot;breaking up&quot; unless it is no longer possible and must be said. In other words, if you don&#39;t say &quot;break up&quot;, don&#39;t leave any room for it - when you say &quot;break up&quot;, it means &quot;sealing the throat with a sword&quot; to the old relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the second situation, the girl’s proposal to break up is false and the purpose is to make her boyfriend submit. On Himalaya, some netizens complained: My girlfriend often threatens to break up with me in order to get me to give her gifts. What kind of mentality is this? A group of netizens commented: This kind of girlfriend just wants something from you. If you are not in too deep, it is better to leave decisively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In reality, it is often the case that girls who break up with them use the breakup as a game to force boys to compromise and satisfy their own needs. In this case, boys&#39; indiscriminate pleading is &quot;cooperating&quot; with the game&#39;s tactics, and it is also a meaningless sacrifice of self-rights and due stance. This can lead to various passive situations. From the perspective of human nature, if a girl unreasonably breaks up with her, she will get very good results - for example, her boyfriend will obey her words and not dare to violate them at all. For example, her boyfriend will buy things to compensate her to make her happy. Then it will be difficult for this girl not to gain a sense of accomplishment and deliberately make it a kind of inertia, making the other person keep flapping according to the owner&#39;s wishes like a bird locked in a cage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As long as a person is not a masochist, it is unlikely that he can endure all kinds of teasing and belittling by the other party without breaking down. To fully accept unfair demands is to dig a hole for yourself. It’s so easy to give in and compromise when you’re in love. After getting married, if the other party files for divorce if they don’t get along, what should you do? Someone has said it well: &quot;Breakups are mentioned frequently now, and divorce will definitely be mentioned frequently in the future.&quot; If this is the case, should we continue to compromise? If this is the case, how much happiness and trust can there be in a marriage? I&#39;m afraid it has long been overdrawn by one party&#39;s willfulness, tyranny and one party&#39;s weakness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that whether it is a true score or a false score, directly agreeing is the best choice. When a person is in front of someone who doesn&#39;t love him, or in front of someone who is always trying to &quot;test&quot; himself, there is no other way for him to do anything but be tough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, people’s hearts are made of flesh, and after being together for a long time, it is indeed difficult to make a break. Human nature is always complicated. Being &quot;kicked&quot; by the other party when you still love the other party deeply is indeed shocking and painful. Therefore, some people who have been broken up with want to stay out of nostalgia for the past relationship. This is not It&#39;s strange, but facts show that long-term pain is worse than short-term pain. It is wise to leave the person who &quot;mispaid&quot; the relationship as soon as possible. No matter how difficult the decision is, no matter how painful the heart is, it is better than letting yourself fall into an emotional quagmire and be unable to get out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You must know that hesitating and insisting on breaking up will not only make you and the other party extremely tired, but you are also more likely to be laughed at and affect your work and life because you cry and feel depressed all day long. future. After all, stalking itself means losing self-esteem and &quot;lowering to the dust&quot;. In addition, being indecisive and being weak can also bring about bad situations and even negative consequences. In life, some couples &quot;will get together if they are separated for a long time, and they will break up if they are together for a long time.&quot; After wasting their great youth, they eventually ended up breaking up, which is equivalent to a wasted effort. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In my hometown, some rural couples have been quarreling all their lives. Often one party wants to leave and the other refuses. As a result, the two people cannot reconcile until they grow old, which also affects the lives of their children. If they break up early, they can Is there such a thing? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Comparing these results, resolutely agreeing to break up will not only save a lot of unnecessary troubles, but also &quot;let go&quot; both parties. Isn&#39;t this the best result? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What&#39;s more, the firm consent of the person being broken up is also a lesson to the other party. A psychology expert told a story that one of her friends was broken up in love and was in a very low mood. He thought she had been dumped, but when he asked, he found out that she was the one who initiated the breakup. The point is, she didn&#39;t want to break up, she just threatened her boyfriend again, but this time her boyfriend didn&#39;t keep her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Breaking up reveals one&#39;s character.&quot; As the saying goes, don’t do to others what you don’t want others to do to you. It’s not easy for two people who truly love each other to come together. They should manage their relationship well and jointly resist various risks encountered in the journey of life. How can you create risks and disturbances by yourself and let yourself fall into trouble? ? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that some people like to talk about breaking up casually and use breakup to control others. This is not only disrespectful to the other party, but also completing a kind of discipline. Some people just enjoy the sense of accomplishment of &quot;taming the other person under their feet and treating them like a dog.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the discipline does not set a time limit, this situation should make people vigilant. Resisting discipline is the responsibility of every person in the &quot;Emotional Castle&quot;. Getting together and staying together easily is the simplest and most practical love rule. Life is not long, and we can be prepared to spend this life with someone, or we can be prepared to let go when the opportunity arises. This is what we should do in order to avoid being troubled and constrained by a marriage that lacks quality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 17:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[领航鲸“搬家”分几步？为啥要抹凡士林？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260907]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On November 17, two pilot whales more than 4 meters long and weighing about 800 kilograms arrived from Hangzhou Departing from a polar ocean park, &quot;relocated&quot; to an ocean park in Zhoushan more than 200 kilometers away, and moved into a more spacious &quot;new home&quot;. With a head weighing 800 kilograms, it is quite a battle to &quot;move&quot; such a big man over a long distance. It not only requires cranes and large trucks, but also requires more than 20 adults to carry it. So the question is, how many steps does it take to &quot;move&quot; a pilot whale? What is the greatest difficulty? What preparations have the staff made to protect the pilot whales? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;What are the steps to “move” a pilot whale? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is not an easy task to &quot;move&quot; a pilot whale weighing about 800 kilograms, and to move both animals together. So, what are the steps to &quot;move&quot; a pilot whale? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The staff said that there are five steps to &quot;moving&quot; the pilot whale this time. The first step: Capture and transportation, after capturing the pilot whale from the breeding tank, transport it to the box; The second step: Putting into the box and hoisting; The third step: Inspection before transportation, including the pilot whale’s breathing frequency, Check the mental state, etc.; Step 4: Monitoring during transportation, including monitoring of water temperature, air temperature, mental state, activity state, respiratory rate, etc. of animals during transportation; Step 5: After arriving at the destination, hoist into the water . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;What are the living habits of pilot whales? Why did it get its name? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;To successfully &quot;move&quot; a big guy like a pilot whale, you need to understand its physiological characteristics and living habits. Next, let’s get to know the large marine creature-pilot whale. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pilot whales are mammals in the family Cetacea, Delphinidae, and are also called &quot;pilot whales&quot; because of their huge size. Pilot whales are divided into two types: long-limbed pilot whales and short-limbed pilot whales. Long-limbed pilot whales are mainly distributed in high-latitude waters, while short-limbed pilot whales are distributed in tropical and temperate waters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/22f69f961e179bf7552d09428fac69b7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;659&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/22f69f961e179bf7552d09428fac69b7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258780&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sun Dong, associate researcher at the Second Institute of Oceanography of the Ministry of Natural Resources:&lt;/strong>;Pilot whales generally like to gather in large groups in the natural marine environment. The size of this group can usually reach 200 to 300. , this is a very large scale, which is rare among whales. Pilot whales are the liveliest among cetaceans. Pilot whales are often seen by sailors willing to accompany sailboats or ships when the ship is sailing on the sea. Their playful behavior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, due to the destruction of the marine environment, the number of pilot whales has been declining, and they have been included in the second level of my country&#39;s &quot;List of National Key Protected Wild Animals&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;What are the difficulties for the &quot;big&quot; pilot whale to &quot;move&quot;? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In addition to their large size and heavy weight, what are the difficulties in &quot;moving&quot; pilot whales? Come on and listen to the expert’s introduction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sun Dong, associate researcher at the Second Institute of Oceanography of the Ministry of Natural Resources:&lt;/strong>;From the most professional perspective, the most important thing about the &quot;movement&quot; of whales is that we call this whale Cetaceans need to use their lungs to breathe, so the vent on its back, or in layman&#39;s terms, its nostrils must be exposed above the water to prevent it from drowning. Cetaceans can drown. But the water cannot be put in very little. If it is put in very little, one will cause its skin to become dry and dehydrated. Dehydration is a very serious event for cetaceans. The second is the huge body of cetaceans. , it needs the buoyancy of water to support its weight. Another factor is temperature. For cetaceans, especially when the temperature rises, it will cause them to suffer from overheating shock. This should be strictly avoided. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Why do pilot whales need to apply Vaseline when they “go out”? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When it comes to &quot;moving&quot; a &quot;big guy&quot; like a pilot whale, every detail is important. There is such a detail in the transfer process that the reporter just photographed. After the pilot whale came out of the water, the staff smeared Vaseline on the pilot whale. Why did they do this? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Quansheng, technical director of a polar marine park in Hangzhou:&lt;/strong>;The pilot whales apply Vaseline to prevent dehydration, because when the temperature is too high, cetaceans can easily dehydrate. After covering it with Vaseline, it will prevent moisture from dispersing. After applying Vaseline, we will cover it with a layer of wet towel. In this way, it has a water-retaining effect, that is, one is to prevent dehydration and the other is to moisturize. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Experts told reporters that this time the two pilot whales &quot;moved&quot;, they were smeared with medical Vaseline which had almost no harm to their skin. The main area of ​​application was the back skin exposed to the air, but Avoid air vents when applying. Two pilot whales arrived at their &quot;new home&quot; in Zhoushan. Before entering the water, the staff used a towel to wipe off the Vaseline on the pilot whales. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;How to reduce the stress response of pilot whales during transportation? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From Hangzhou to Zhoushan, it spans more than 200 kilometers. To ensure the safety of the animals, the vehicle must maintain a stable speed of 90 kilometers per hour during transportation. This extended the original drive of more than 2 hours to 5 hours. How can pilot whales reduce their stress response during long-distance transfers and reach their &quot;new home&quot; safely? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Quansheng, technical director of a polar marine park in Hangzhou:&lt;/strong>;We will stop eating 24 hours before transportation, and gradually reduce the amount of food in the first three days. This is the first ; Second, we will ensure appropriate water and air temperatures during transportation. This time we set the water temperature for the pilot whale at 23.5°C, which is a water temperature that is more suitable for raising it; third, we We need to ensure that the air in this transport vehicle circulates, that it cannot be too hot or too windy, and that it must be enclosed. Fourthly, we will have accompanying veterinarians and keepers who have raised it for a long time, who will caress and carry it out. An exchange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to allow the pilot whales to adapt to the new environment as quickly as possible, the room temperature, water temperature, lighting and other aspects of Zhoushan&#39;s &quot;new home&quot; are set according to the natural environment in which they live. However, in the first two days after arrival, the staff will feed a small amount of food, and then resume a normal diet after the pilot whales slowly adapt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[商务部清理歧视外资措施，废除“特斯拉禁入”是个好的开始丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260899]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce recently stated at a regular press conference that the Ministry of Commerce has recently organized a special cleanup to further investigate Regulations and measures that may exist that discriminate against foreign-funded enterprises will create a fairer market competition environment for foreign-funded enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the website of the Ministry of Commerce, the Department of Foreign Investment of the Ministry of Commerce issued a document on November 8, requiring a special cleanup of regulations and measures containing unreasonable differential treatment of domestic and foreign capital. The scope of the cleanup includes laws, regulations, normative documents, and other policy measures issued by local governments and departments, as well as various measures related to business entities formulated by relevant departments. The document also lists a number of specific cleanup matters, including restrictions on foreign investment in access areas, discriminating or excluding foreign-invested enterprises and their products and services on the grounds of foreign brands, excluding or restricting foreign-invested enterprises from participating in government procurement, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Ministry of Commerce’s special clean-up operation is targeted. In recent years, with the improvement of China&#39;s economic strength and external trade frictions such as &quot;decoupling and breaking links&quot;, there has been a domestic argument that &quot;it is strong enough and no longer needs foreign investment.&quot; There are also more and more comments on social media that are hostile to foreign brand products, and there are even restrictions on foreign brand products in some places. Some time ago, Hunan Yueyang Sanhe Airport banned Tesla electric vehicles from entering the airport on the grounds of &quot;confidential control.&quot; After attracting great attention, Yueyang Airport lifted this restriction, but similar phenomena still exist in many local departments. In addition to Tesla, Apple&#39;s mobile phones and other electronic products also receive special &quot;care&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of restriction on foreign brands has no legal basis. In September 2023, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning stated at a press conference that China has not issued laws, regulations or policy documents prohibiting the purchase and use of foreign brand mobile phones such as Apple. The reason why some departments and companies ban Tesla cars, Apple mobile phones, etc. is that their cameras, microphones and other sensors may obtain surrounding environment information and upload it abroad, which involves &quot;state secrets&quot; and &quot;personal information security&quot;. However, according to Tesla&#39;s statement, the video captured by its car&#39;s &quot;Sentinel Mode&quot; is only stored in the vehicle&#39;s local storage device and will not be uploaded to the Internet. Other vehicle data will only be uploaded to the company&#39;s data center in China. The iCloud service used by Apple&#39;s domestic users is also operated by the domestic big data company &quot;Cloud Guizhou&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Tesla and Apple are foreign brands, their products sold domestically are basically produced in factories in China. Their super factory in Shanghai has more than 10,000 employees. In addition, the localization rate of Tesla&#39;s auto parts has exceeded 95%, which has stimulated the development of many domestic companies in the upstream industrial chain, not only bringing income to the employees of these companies, but also improving the production level of the companies. The improvement of the production capacity of these enterprises has also provided energy for the development of other domestic automobile manufacturers. The same is true for Apple. Not only does its domestic foundries directly provide jobs for hundreds of thousands of people, but it also greatly improves the capabilities of the domestic industrial chain through strict management of domestic suppliers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Introducing foreign capital is not just about hundreds of millions or even billions of money, but more importantly, entrepreneurial spirit and talent, which is to discover or even &quot;create&quot; market opportunities and seize them. , the ability to create social wealth. During the process of reform and opening up, the introduction of foreign investment has played a huge role in promoting China&#39;s economic development. This impetus does not only come from money itself. China&#39;s goal of introducing foreign investment is not only to solve the problem of insufficient domestic development funds, but more importantly, to &quot;learn advanced Western technology and management experience.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, it may be the competition, management and other concepts that come with foreign investment that play a greater role in promoting China&#39;s development. It is precisely because of the pressure of foreign capital that China&#39;s market-oriented reform has been accelerated, and domestic enterprises have also strengthened their bodies and developed in the competition with foreign capital. Even though China has now become the world&#39;s second largest economy, it still needs to introduce foreign investment. Because in many areas, China still needs foreign technology and entrepreneurial talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2023, the State Council issued the &quot;24 Policies and Measures for Attracting Foreign Investment,&quot; emphasizing the need to create a &quot;market-oriented, legal, and international first-class business environment.&quot; A market-oriented and legalized business environment requires that foreign-invested enterprises be treated equally and receive national treatment. As long as they are not within the scope of the negative list stipulated by the state, there cannot be any discrimination or restrictions on foreign investment. The products and services provided by domestic foreign-funded enterprises should also be treated equally with those of other domestic enterprises. Just like although the &quot;Government Procurement Law&quot; stipulates that under normal circumstances government procurement &quot;should purchase domestic goods, projects and services,&quot; the Ministry of Finance issued a special document in 2021 requiring that except for procurement projects involving national security and state secrets, government procurement must not distinguish Treat products produced in China by domestic and foreign-funded enterprises. As long as it is produced within China, regardless of whether its suppliers are domestic or foreign, their equal participation in government procurement should be guaranteed. This special clean-up operation by the Ministry of Commerce also includes the issue of restricting foreign-invested enterprises from participating in local bidding and government procurement as a clean-up matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Ministry of Commerce’s cleanup operation began, social media information showed that some local agencies’ “No Tesla Entry” signs had been removed. Prohibiting discrimination against foreign-owned enterprises is a good start. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 15:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[人为什么变胖，问题可能没那么简单]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260883]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The global obesity and overweight problems have become increasingly apparent in recent decades. According to data from the World Health Organization, in 2016 Nearly 40% of adults worldwide are overweight, of which 13% are obese. There are approximately 2 billion overweight people. This increase continues despite public health measures to prevent and slow obesity in many countries. Along with the obesity epidemic comes a large disease burden. How to better manage weight has become an urgent problem in the field of health sciences. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Balancing the quality and quantity of carbohydrates&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Carbohydrates, as a major source of dietary energy for people, have long been the focus of weight loss. Coping strategies such as the &quot;ketogenic diet&quot; of eating less or no staple food, or even strictly limiting carbohydrate intake have been derived. The &quot;ketogenic diet&quot; cuts off carbohydrates as an energy source and attempts to promote weight loss by burning fat to provide energy. Although this method has some short-term experimental support, what will happen if it is persisted in the long term is still a mystery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, the &quot;ketogenic diet&quot; requires maintaining a high level of fat intake while maximizing carbohydrate intake, which may increase the risk related to cardiovascular disease. In addition, it will also put pressure on the liver, kidneys and maintenance of nutritional balance, and there is a risk of a series of adverse reactions such as cognitive decline, constipation, fatigue, and nausea. Therefore, long-term adherence to such a diet for weight loss remains controversial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, compared with the controversial &quot;ketogenic diet&quot; that strictly limits carbohydrate intake, a diet that reasonably controls carbohydrates has actually been widely recognized, including paying more attention to nutritional balance and simplicity. Processed “Mediterranean Diet” etc. Recently, scientists from Harvard School of Public Health and other institutions also found through long-term observational studies that instead of focusing generally on the total amount of carbohydrate intake, it is better to pay more attention to the quality and source of carbohydrates, so as to achieve better long-term weight management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because their research data shows that some carbohydrate-containing foods do make you fatter as you eat them, but there are also some carbohydrate-rich foods that may actually have a weight loss effect if you eat too much of them. Overall, higher glycemic index and glycemic load will lead to weight gain. Adding 100 grams of starch or added sugar per day increased weight gain by 1.5 kilograms and 0.9 kilograms respectively over four years. Relevant research was published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) in September 2023. The main sources of daily starch are seeds and tubers such as wheat and rice, which are various staple foods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Starchy vegetables such as potatoes and peas, and refined grains are also associated with weight gain. A 100-gram daily intake increase will increase weight gain by 2.6 kilograms and 0.8 kilograms respectively. But if it is non-starchy vegetables and whole grains, the increase in intake will actually reduce weight gain and help control weight. Increasing the intake of non-starchy vegetables by 100 grams per day will reduce weight gain by 3 kilograms, and the intake of 100 grams of whole grains will reduce weight gain by 0.4 kilograms. Similarly, consuming carbohydrates through fruits can also help reduce weight gain, with a daily intake increase of 100 grams corresponding to 1.6 kilograms less weight gain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why these data are limited to four years to assess weight change is because some health data in the study are updated on a four-year cycle. Using data from more than 130,000 people in projects such as the Nurses&#39; Health Study, researchers analyzed the relationship between people&#39;s diet and weight changes over more than two decades and discovered these overall patterns of carbohydrates. Over the past two decades, people&#39;s average weight has increased by 8.8 kilograms, about 1.5 kilograms every four years. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Highly processed carbohydrates have become a target&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;If a person pays more attention to the management of carbohydrate quality and sources, use equal amounts of non-starchy vegetables, fruits and Substituting whole grains for foods like refined grains, starchy vegetables, and sugary drinks will result in less weight gain. In addition to foods such as vegetables and whole grains that are consumed in large amounts, an increase in dietary fiber intake also helps with weight management. Every 10 grams of increase per day corresponds to a reduction of 0.8 kilograms of weight gain. Considering that the age of the people in the study happens to span the middle-aged and elderly stages, including the critical period of weight gain in middle age, this large-sample long-term follow-up study has important reference significance for middle-aged people to strengthen weight management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, although the latest research data has the advantages of large volume and long follow-up time, and can capture more changes in diet and health, there are still some limitations, such as carbohydrate intake and Information such as weight is reported by the respondents themselves. There may be certain errors in these data, which will affect relevant conclusions and interpretations. To better understand the long-term health effects of carbohydrates, more randomized, controlled, long-term studies are needed to further confirm the conclusions in the latest findings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for why people become obese, the most popular explanation is energy imbalance, which is commonly known as &quot;eating more and moving less&quot;, but this is not the exact answer to the common obesity phenomenon in humans. As obesity rates remain high, some scientists think the problem may not be that simple. Two common explanations currently take into account more complex body system factors. For example, one view is that on the basis that energy intake exceeds consumption, because modern people eat too much ultra-processed food with high energy density, there may also be endocrine, metabolic and nervous system effects, making it more difficult for people to eat food. Self-control. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another explanation related to insulin is that the hormonal response triggered by a large amount of ultra-processed carbohydrates causes the body to store more energy in fat, resulting in a lack of energy required for basic metabolism of the body. , after the brain recognizes this state, it will issue a hunger command, thus entering a vicious cycle of getting fatter and overeating. While the understanding of obesity remains controversial, these analyzes and a host of health studies have focused on carbohydrates in processed foods, including all types of so-called &quot;junk food&quot; that are high in sugar and fat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ultra-processed carbohydrates are classified as &quot;junk food&quot;, which is not unrelated to the current scientific community&#39;s understanding of the functions of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are the only macronutrient for which there is no minimum intake requirement. In reality, in some places people eat a lot, but in other places people eat very little. What specific ranges of carbohydrate intake humans need to maintain in order to survive, be healthy, and even live longer are specific questions that need to be answered by scientific evidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The risks and costs of eating out&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From an evolutionary perspective, larger brain capacity is consistent with the evolutionary process of humans, and larger brain capacity is consistent with the evolutionary process of humans. The brain needs more energy support. After humans entered agricultural civilization, typical lifestyle changes included growing and eating grains, which are foods rich in carbohydrates. For this reason, the human digestive system has become more adapted to starch, but accordingly, new eating habits have also brought about a series of new health problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Latest research suggests that the mechanisms by which carbohydrates, glycemic index, and glycemic load may have negative health effects on weight may include enhanced responses to changes in insulin and other hormones that favor fat accumulation. . In recent years, some studies have shown that in addition to weight gain, the quality of carbohydrates may also increase a series of other health risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, a systematic analysis study published in The Lancet showed that compared with those who ate the least dietary fiber, people who ate the most dietary fiber had better health outcomes. The risks of a range of diseases are 15% to 30% lower, including lower cardiovascular disease mortality, coronary heart disease incidence, stroke incidence and mortality, and lower risks of type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer. In addition, clinical trial data also shows that eating more dietary fiber will lower blood pressure and total cholesterol. The lowest risk dietary fiber intake is 25 to 29 grams per day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similarly, studies have found that whole grain intake may also help reduce overall disease risk. Increasing the intake of dietary fiber in the daily diet, replacing refined grains with whole grains, and eating more coarse grains will not only help with weight management, but also improve people&#39;s health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that with the epidemic of obesity in recent years, scientists have tried to verify a variety of weight loss and weight management strategies, most of which are related to &quot;eating&quot;, including the total energy of meals and the amount of food consumed. time. In 2022, a one-year intermittent fasting trial carried out in China found that while restricting food energy, arranging eating times from 8 am to 4 pm every day and not eating at other times, such a The weight loss effect of this dietary pattern is no better than that of energy restriction alone, indicating the importance of controlling energy intake for weight loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in April 2023, Australian researchers further narrowed the eating time window to 8 am to 12 noon every day, limiting the intake of 30% of the required energy to only these four hours. And you stick to this eating method for three non-consecutive days in a week, and you can eat whatever you want at other times. The experimental results found that under certain circumstances, intermittent fasting that limits meal times still has its own unique effect, not only can Lowering the weight of trial participants could also improve people&#39;s glucose tolerance and reduce their risk of type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Leonie Heilbronn, a professor at the University of Adelaide School of Medicine and others who have long studied fasting and meal times, explained to Southern Weekend reporters that human metabolism is governed by biological rhythms The brain operates downwards, alternating between day and night 24 hours a day. Improper eating time will cause the brain&#39;s light and dark rhythms to be out of sync with the biological clocks in other organs and tissues. Moving meals earlier and avoiding eating at night will help the body coordinate these rhythms. combine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, a randomized controlled trial in the UK also supported the conclusion of eating early, but it was not because of differences in metabolism at different times, but because the study at that time found that if you eat more in the morning, your overall health will be reduced throughout the day. If the meal time is moved forward, people will not feel too hungry that day, and appetite and total energy intake will be controlled. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Weight management should be a long-term plan&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;For weight control, no matter what the strategy is or how difficult it is, whether it can be persisted in the long term is the key to weight management. key. Otherwise, no matter how radical and rapid the weight loss method is, it will rebound when you can&#39;t persist, and destroy people&#39;s confidence in weight management during the continuous rebound. Some people whose obesity problem is particularly serious and whose weight loss through conventional methods has been ineffective can only reduce their health risks through extremely limited methods such as bariatric surgery. However, this method requires the removal of part of the stomach, which is extremely invasive and does not work. Not suitable for most people who have less severe weight problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From this perspective, the latest research controls weight by managing the source of carbohydrates, which does not involve harsh food intake restrictions or long fasting times, and has positive implications for people&#39;s long-term weight management. significance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, the researchers also found that the relationship between carbohydrate sources and weight management was more obvious in overweight or obese people than in people of normal weight, indicating that these people may be more susceptible to weight changes. Sensitive, more fragile, but in turn suggests that those who pay more attention to the sources of carbohydrates in their diet may benefit more from this type of weight management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reflected in specific foods, it is necessary to limit sugary drinks and various types of steamed, fried, and baked refined rice noodles, and instead eat more roughly processed grains, fruits, and non-starchy foods. Vegetables etc. The &quot;Mediterranean diet&quot; widely praised by scientists is actually more scientific in managing carbohydrate sources and maintaining nutritional balance. In addition to consuming more vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, it also eats more beans and nuts, and more Fish and moderate amounts of poultry and dairy, but not a lot of red meat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
