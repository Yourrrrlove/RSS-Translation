The picture comes from the official website of Shenzhen Happy Valley&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At around 18:27 on October 27, 2023, a vehicle collision occurred in the roller coaster &quot;Snowy Eagle&quot; in Happy Valley, a well-known theme park in Shenzhen, injuring 8 people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I was sitting on the second roller coaster at the time.

Visitors who have purchased tickets can receive a full refund through the original purchase channel. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Tourists said there was a &quot;system problem&quot; the day before&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;I heard a loud noise at that time, and many staff members ran in and asked us to give way. We didn&#39;t know what happened at first What happened? I found out later that it was a car crash.&quot; Zhao Xin, a student who was queuing at the scene, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhao Xin said that several students from Shenzhen Huitong School were on the roller coaster where the accident occurred. “Several of them went up to play together. One of them had some stomach injuries because he didn’t have time to get off, and the other one It’s more serious and I passed out.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At about 23:00 on the 27th, a Southern Weekend reporter called the customer service of the University of Hong Kong Shenzhen Hospital. A staff member on the line said he was unclear about the situation, but said that the current queue time in the emergency department would be It&#39;s very long. &quot;There are more people waiting in the emergency department now.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the official website of Shenzhen Happy Valley, &quot;Snowy Eagle&quot; has a five-star thrill level. It is a catapult roller coaster built with a huge investment of 200 million and is the tallest and longest catapult roller coaster in Asia, with a total length of 550 meters. &quot;Speed ​​up in 2 seconds, galloping at 135 kilometers per hour, falling vertically from 60 meters, heart-poundingly crazy for 90 seconds, 4G maximum acceleration, the experience of going to the sky, going to the ground, and going into the sea is thrilling to the end.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This is It is a relatively popular event, and there were a lot of people queuing up today.&quot; Zhao Xin recalled that she had been queuing for nearly two hours. If nothing had happened, it would have been her turn to get on the next bus. Finally, she left around 19:00 At the scene, &quot;When my friend went over to play, he found that the project had been closed.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 26, the day before the incident, Chen Yuangang played &quot;Snow Land&quot; with his friends. Eagle&quot; project. She told Southern Weekend reporters that there was a problem with the system at that time: &quot;The Snow Eagle made a loud sound when it ejected, but I didn&#39;t hear it at the time, and then I found that the car had returned to the starting position. After a while, , the roller coaster ejected again, and returned to the starting position after a normal run.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Yuan recalled that the vehicle system activated the emergency protection device at that time, and tourists on the roller coaster were unable to get off. &quot;The staff used the microphone to inform the remaining people in line that there was a problem with the system and needed to be repaired, so they could not continue playing. They also issued speed passes to the remaining people in line.&quot; Chen Yuan said that everyone stayed on the stalled roller coaster again. After about ten minutes, the staff adjusted and the emergency braking mode was released and we were able to get out of the car. &quot;About two hours after the emergency repairs, Happy Valley notified Snow Eagle to resume operations.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Maintenance is done every day&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Public information shows that Shenzhen Happy Valley has been open since 1998 and is a new generation of large-scale theme park of OCT Group. Among them, the catapult roller coaster &quot;Snowy Eagle&quot; project was officially opened in July 2012. Its vehicle structure includes two trains (orange car and green car), each train has 6 carriages, and each carriage can accommodate 4 people. There are 24 people in the whole car and 48 people in the two cars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, a rear-end collision involving an aerial sightseeing train occurred in Happy Valley. On November 1, 2018, while two &quot;Happy Main Line&quot; sightseeing trains were running over the Overseas Chinese Town tourist resort, the front train stopped due to a system failure, causing a slight rear-end collision with the rear train. There were about 20 passengers on the two trains, causing 2 People get hurt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to information from the China Bidding and Bidding Public Service Platform, on March 21, 2023, Shenzhen OCT Happy Valley Tourism Company issued a bidding announcement for the overhaul service project of the Shenzhen Happy Valley Snowy Eagle Project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bidding announcement shows that the overhaul service project of Shenzhen Happy Valley&#39;s &quot;Snowy Eagle&quot; project includes professional evaluation of the overall operation situation, carrying out Snowy Eagle&#39;s service status evaluation, safety and reliability evaluation, large-scale Repairs, condition monitoring systems and other work will be carried out, and it will pass statutory inspections, regulatory filings, etc. The planned construction period is from April 20, 2023 to June 30, 2023.

Maintenance is done every day. Weekly maintenance is done every week, monthly maintenance is done every month, and maintenance is done every year. It is impossible to say that there is any rust.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When asked about the cause of the accident, the person in charge said : &quot;Our company has a unified response to this aspect, and everything is now waiting for investigation and technical analysis.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(should be At the request of the interviewee, the interviewees in the article are all pseudonyms)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 10:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“美容腐败”Vs从“表哥”到低调腐败：性别偏好影响腐败模式丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259326]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, according to the website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the State Supervision Commission, a former member of the Party Group and Vice Chairman of the Beijing Yanqing District Committee of the CPPCC Chen Guifen was expelled from the party and public office, and the suspected criminal issues will be transferred to the procuratorate for review and prosecution in accordance with the law. The notice specifically mentioned that Chen Guifen &quot;violated regulations in accepting gifts and arrangements for beauty activities.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, expressions such as &quot;accepting beauty activities&quot; and &quot;addicted to beauty&quot; have appeared many times in official review reports on dismissed female officials. Chen Guifen&#39;s defeat this time has further brought the new term &quot;beauty corruption&quot; to the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called &quot;beauty corruption&quot; refers to cases of corruption and bribery that occur due to accepting beauty activities. Among the typical cases reported in recent years, the high amount of money involved and the bizarre corruption projects of &quot;beauty corruption&quot; have been breathtaking. The former director of the Anshan Municipal Taxation Bureau Liu Guangming’s “500,000 butt plastic surgery fee”, the latter the former mayor of Manzhouli City Xu Ailian’s “150,000 yuan for a beauty needle”, and the former vice president of North China University of Technology Shen Zhili’s “single consumption of 690,000 yuan” &quot;An astonishing number. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to infer from the term &quot;cosmetic corruption&quot; that certain types of corruption are indeed related to gender. Due to the different preferences of men and women, it is not difficult to understand that bribers will cater to them in a targeted manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;willfulness&quot; of power will find an outlet, just like life, to satisfy the individual desires of those who abuse power. Cash and real estate, gold and silver jewelry, luxury cars and watches, antique calligraphy and paintings, there is always something suitable for fallen officials, which is also a common feature of corruption among male and female officials. However, the difference in preferences between male and female officials in the form of corruption is also a visible phenomenon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early years, the ostentatious culture of men showing off their success also had an impact on the officialdom. There were many incidents where people were arrested for corruption based on photos. In view of this, in recent years, the corruption of male officials has mostly been &quot;low-key&quot; and &quot;hidden&quot;, which is the &quot;lesson&quot; learned from certain &quot;cousins&quot; and &quot;brothers&quot; who were dismissed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, in terms of forms of corruption, the &quot;indirect&quot; and &quot;confusing&quot; characteristics of male officials are becoming more and more obvious, such as &quot;setting up offshore accounts&quot;, &quot;accepting bribes after retirement&quot;, &quot;shadow companies&quot;, &quot;option corruption&quot;, etc. There are endless means. The ancient &quot;elegant bribery&quot; has not completely gone into history. The high-end bribery and acceptance of bribes with the help of antique calligraphy and painting are still common in the corruption details of fallen male officials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, male officials are also trying to hide their wealth and keep a low profile. They are no longer easily caught because of their public image as usual. Regarding the details of corruption, male officials also try their best to cover up and leave no traceable information, such as the &quot;$300,000 gift box&quot; codenamed &quot;Little Seafood&quot; received by Sun Lijun, and Zhang Qi, former member of the Standing Committee of the Hainan Provincial Party Committee and former Secretary of the Haikou Municipal Party Committee. The secret method of &quot;filling the home with 13.5 tons of gold bars&quot;. Male officials can often use their special interests and hobbies to satisfy their greed while hiding the fact of corruption: Yang Hongwei, former deputy secretary of the party group and deputy director of the Chongqing Municipal Administration for Market Regulation, is known as the &quot;ball secretary&quot; and is keen on playing basketball during working hours. , using playing ball to cover up his corrupt behavior of giving and receiving privately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to see that playing ball and other hobbies are more common among men. Judging from some female officials who have been dismissed in recent years, corruption that combines power and the love of beauty is not uncommon. From accessories, clothing and bags to luxury goods consumption, to the so-called &quot;beauty corruption&quot;. Just like the corruption record of Bai Hong, the former chairman of the labor union of the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau, &quot;the praise and jealousy of the people around him made Bai Hong immersed in the pleasure of a successful woman.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For bribers to pay for beauty treatments on their behalf, or to give high-priced beauty salon membership cards, this can constitute bribery of female officials, and even the development of novel money laundering methods. In real life, it is not uncommon for &quot;ordinary people to pay exorbitant prices for beauty treatments.&quot; However, once a female official&#39;s love for beauty is empowered by her desire for power, the resulting corruption will become even more like a torrential flood. &quot;Power keeps people young forever&quot; is not only a symbolic statement for female officials, but also a realistic statement that can be realized with the help of beauty consumption. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not just officials who are corrupt. People in key positions can still be corrupt, and corruption tends to be younger. Young people tend to be bolder and more reckless in their corruption. Zhang Yujie, a &quot;post-1995&quot; clerk at the Chuzhou Real Estate Registration Center, embezzled nearly 70 million yuan in public funds, tens of thousands of which were spent on game cards. After the incident, this card was auctioned for more than 80 million yuan. His hobby is playing games. In the 2016 &quot;Accounting Corruption Case of Four Young Women in Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province&quot;, Bai Ling, the former cash accountant of the Gaoyou Municipal Agricultural Committee, misappropriated 10.51 million yuan in public funds, of which more than 8 million yuan was used for beauty consumption. At the time of the case, she was only 29 Years old, it is really shocking to embezzle such a huge amount of money just for beauty consumption. Their preference is to love beauty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 34 of the &quot;Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China on Administrative Punishment for Public Officials&quot; stipulates that &quot;those who accept or provide arrangements for banquets, travel, fitness, entertainment and other activities that may affect the fair exercise of public power will be given a warning, A demerit or a major demerit will be recorded, and if the circumstances are serious, the person will be demoted or dismissed.&quot; Beauty corruption, in terms of form, is a relatively hidden &quot;entertainment and other activities&quot;, and the amount involved is often in compliance with the &quot;Applicable Laws on Handling Criminal Cases of Corruption and Bribery&quot; of the two high authorities. The &quot;extremely huge amount&quot; standard in &quot;Explanation of Certain Issues&quot; can be called hidden corruption in the gray area. Therefore, to combat beauty corruption, we need to start from the source of corruption and curb the room for arbitrary power. This point is gender-neutral. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 10:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国家数据局揭牌，年内落马中管干部达39人丨时政周报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259490]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/27/26cYbymIzOStR24cc3LlYF4O4UW02DgWUpAEzt6F.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;617&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/27/26cYbymIzOStR24cc3LlYF4O4UW0 2DgWUpAEzt6F. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255790&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 25, 2023, the National Data Administration was officially launched. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(People&#39;s Vision/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After more than seven months of preparation, on the morning of October 25, 2023, a group of members of the preparatory team Witnessed by representatives from other ministries and commissions, the National Data Agency was officially unveiled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So far, the two newly established departments in the ninth institutional reform of the State Council have been completed. Previously, the newly established State Financial Supervision and Administration Bureau had completed its listing on May 18, 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The new round of institutional reform plan of the State Council shows that the National Data Administration is managed by the National Development and Reform Commission and is specifically responsible for coordinating and promoting the construction of data infrastructure systems, coordinating the integration, sharing and development and utilization of data resources, and coordinating the promotion of digital China, digital economy, Digital society planning and construction, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Exploring the Blue Ocean of Data&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Before the National Data Bureau announced its establishment, the importance of data had been emphasized many times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2023, the &quot;Overall Layout Plan for the Construction of Digital China&quot; was issued. Earlier, at the end of 2022, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the &quot;Opinions on Building a Data Infrastructure System to Better Play the Role of Data Elements.&quot; Both documents include content to accelerate the development of the digital economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jiandong, deputy director of the Price Monitoring Center of the National Development and Reform Commission, was more direct. In an exclusive interview with the media in April 2023, he once proposed that by the end of the &quot;14th Five-Year Plan&quot; period, the size of China&#39;s data element circulation market will reach one trillion yuan, which is a huge blue ocean. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Existing data has confirmed this statement. The &quot;Digital China Development Report (2022)&quot; released by the Cyberspace Administration of China shows that the scale of China&#39;s data digital economy will reach 50.2 trillion yuan in 2022, ranking second in the world, accounting for 41.5% of GDP, and will continue to remain the same. With a high growth rate of 10%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, according to Zhang Xianghong, a professor at the International Research Center for Information Management Theory and Technology at Beijing Jiaotong University, the current level of development of China&#39;s public data, corporate data and personal data is still low, and the level of utilization is not high. Problems of insufficient motivation and insufficient utilization of vitality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this reason, unified data resource management and activation of data efficiency have become high hopes for the National Data Administration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a previous interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend, Yuan Lizhi, a partner at Jingtian &amp; Gongcheng Law Firm and an expert in data law, mentioned that in January 2023, after a seminar on the circulation of data elements, the state Staff from the National Development and Reform Commission once worked with him to communicate on practical issues regarding the circulation of data elements. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Two leaders made their early appearance&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;They have clear development goals, which is also reflected in the personnel arrangements of the National Data Bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 18, 2023, Liu Liehong, the first director of the National Data Administration, made his first public appearance at the high-level forum on digital economy of the third &quot;Belt and Road&quot; International Cooperation Summit Forum. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The resume shows that Liu Liehong was born in 1968 and has worked in industrial electronic information institutions for a long time.

During his tenure, he promoted the development of the mobile industry and 5G network applications. After becoming the chairman of China Unicom Group in August 2021, he also promoted China Unicom&#39;s transformation into a digital pioneer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like Liu Liehong, who actively embraces digitalization, Shen Zhulin, deputy director of the National Data Administration, who was appointed on October 11, also has extensive experience in digital economy, electronic information and big data promotion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public information shows that Shen Zhulin has worked at the National Development and Reform Commission for a long time. He has served as deputy inspector of the High-tech Industry Department, deputy director of the High-Tech Department, and director of the Innovation and High-tech Development Department of the National Development and Reform Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2016, Shen Zhulin proposed at a symposium held by the Central Cyberspace Administration of China that data resources should be truly treated as an important economic resource and some measures should be taken to truly open and share data. measure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to selecting &quot;professional counterparts&quot; for bureau leaders, the National Data Bureau also has relatively clear requirements for basic talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Recruitment Brochure for Civil Servants Recruited by Central Agencies and Their Directly Affiliated Agencies for the 2024 Examination&quot; published on October 15, 2023 shows that in this round of recruitment, the National Data Bureau has opened a total of 12 recruitment quotas in 5 units.

&lt;p>;但在这些客观因素之外，我感受到，有一股强烈的心灵力量，让广西这两所高校的硬核军训得以顺畅推行。在参加特战训练的学生心中，军训不是一项强迫完成的义务，而是被渴慕的生命体验。一种人，从军训第一天起就期盼着一切结束那天的解脱感；另一种人，则希望追求军训的内在价值，即使军训结束，也渴望将其延续。我自认为，学生时代参加军训时，我属于前者；但桂林高校的参训学生，有很多属于后者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;沈鸿受访时，有些腼腆。爱国国防教育协会主席黄翊龙常说，沈鸿是红军排雷炮手的优秀代表。听到这类赞扬，沈鸿或埋头看地，或遥望路灯，刻意向我藏起笑意。与偶尔飘忽的神情不同，即便人已经出列，二十多分钟内，沈鸿的模拟枪从头至尾都被他以标准的持枪姿势定在胸口，不曾移动分毫。两周新生军训、两周协会的日常训练，似乎让他把坚如磐石的动作刻成了习惯。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;提到特战训练的艰辛，沈鸿总是轻描淡写：“手肘、膝盖、腿、脚都有擦伤，但敷点药就过去了。”“跃进时突然听到左右遇敌的指令，身体反应不过来，这个动作就一直练，加强练。开始会做错，练三四天我能做标准。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比起这些，“军人”的身份对沈鸿更有感召力。他出生于广西环江毛南族自治县，今年刚大一，已经追了十多年战争片、谍战剧。回忆起和父亲一起看电视的时光，沈鸿的语调提高了几度，“中国军人很帅气。”他第一次知道身为农民的父亲还当过兵，是因为看到了他的行军水壶，“那是军队里特有的水壶。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;沈鸿确信，如果自身条件符合征兵标准，他毕业后定会入伍。对他而言，这次军训，不只是按教学大纲上的必修课程，更是正式从军前严肃的预备演练。吸引他加入战术连队的，不只有形式丰富的枪械训练，还有随压力而来的“军人的自豪感。”在沈鸿眼中，队友也是“家国意识强烈，说话直接又豪爽的人”。 “我喜欢和这样能够推心置腹的人做朋友。”他渴望未来的军营生活也是如此：在草地训练时被蚂蚁咬，有战友会乐呵呵地递上一剂药膏。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;9月28日，桂航军训汇演结束时天色已暗，没有机会在汇演中乘坐装甲车的特战队员以八九人为一批，挨个爬上装甲车。他们在车顶勾肩搭背坐成小半圈，一边唱着歌，一边随战车向前挺进。每个人的脸上都挂着疲惫的迷彩妆，歌声却依然嘹亮，他们就像久经沙场的战士们，凯旋而归。行进到操场中央，装甲车猛然停下，队员们一个趔趄，仿佛也是梦醒于此。但当他们从车上爬下来，又看到远处其他队员盘腿坐在路灯下，吵吵嚷嚷，热热闹闹，便奔了过去，战友的微信、照片、言语，长存于迷彩色的梦境之后。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;母亲告诉我，杨奶奶今年81岁，是村里年龄最大的人。杨奶奶的老伴过世多年，她的两个儿子都在省城武汉发展，她独居。我见地里种有白萝卜、胡萝卜、红菜苔、卷心菜，便问杨奶奶为何要种这么多，她说，“四个月后，孩子们都回家了，一起有9张嘴。”我一下子意识到，四个月后就是春节。她还补充了一句，“不仅他们过年回来吃，我还得备一些给他们走的时候带走。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;看到早些时候种下的萝卜长势不是很好，我问她何故，她告诉两点原因。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其一，很多农民进城打工了，很多田地荒芜了，灌木丛到处都是，野猪、獾子等动物较之从前多了许多，像人多势众一样，它们已经不是夜里偷偷摸摸地吃包括蔬菜在内的农作物，大白天它们也可以大大方方地入侵菜地、谷地、红薯地，白天，老人还能时不时杵着一根棍子过来菜地看守，驱赶一下野物，夜里，她就完全没有办法了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其二，因为长期使用农药及化肥，农地的土壤结构发生了变异，土壤板结严重，肥力下降得厉害，包括蔬菜在内的各类农作物的产量锐减。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;事实上，我们回不去了&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;叮嘱杨奶奶小心一些后，我和母亲继续散步。眼前是大片的稻田，母亲问我知道哪块是我家的，我猜了两次，母亲皆摇摇头。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我顿觉惭愧，我连自家的田地都不知在哪里。应该是2008年工作以来，每次我回家，父母都不怎么下地干农活，专门陪着我，我当然也鲜有机会下地。时间久了，我也就忘了家里田地的准确位置。见稻谷呈金黄色，我提议第二天收割，我也帮忙割，不料母亲对我的割稻技艺很不放心。“还是等你回广州了，我和你爸慢慢来吧，你多年不下田，万一割到手，就不好了。”我竟然无言以对，因为事实就是我虽然经常回家，但很少下地干活，早已不像我念小学和初中那会儿，是家里重要的劳力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我在广州某高校任职，我有为期不短的暑假及寒假，我每年回家的天数远多于村里其他年轻人。譬如我弟，他17岁高二辍学后就开始了他的打工生涯，基本上一年到头都在外打工，除了春节回家半月左右。我弟今年44岁，迄今打工了27年。如今，他已在武汉购房，弟媳及两个侄子也都在武汉常住，大侄子念大学，弟媳照顾上小学的小侄子。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如今，我的小家一家四口在广州，我弟的小家一家四口在武汉，我们都主动或被动地卷入了城镇化的浪潮，我们很难再回到家乡发展或定居了。事实上，我们也回不去了，因为我们早已不是“农业人口”了，我们一直在从事“非农产业”，与我弟的户籍至今在老家无关。不管我们是不是享受到了地道广州或武汉市民的各类福利或待遇，我们都已经是名副其实的（新）广州人或（新）武汉人，广州或武汉是我们的常住地，是我们及孩子们吃喝拉撒、衣食住行的地儿。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我和我弟是70后，村里比我们年幼的80后、90后干嘛呢？现在何处？少部分人依靠读书离开了家乡，绝大部分像我弟一样常年在外打工，他们的共同点是常年不在家，不回家，有且只有过年才回家待上十天半月。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比我们年长的60后又在干嘛呢？我所在的村有8位60后，其中4位随子女进城务工，要么照顾上学的孙子，要么给做建筑工的儿子打打下手，有两位开了装修公司，分别在武汉和西宁做起了老板，最后两个都在教育行业，一位在武汉某大学做老师，另外一位在家乡的村小学做校长。不难看出，8位60后也基本上都脱离了农村及农业，也都是逢过年才回家的人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;60后、70后、80后、90后现在都进城了，目前都在城里打拼，他们未来有回村的计划或迹象吗？我感觉微乎其微。他们在城里多年，饮食、文化、习惯等早已高度城市化了，80后及90后，他们经历了城市化的漂洗，商场、KTV、影院，快餐、游戏厅，他们已经离不开这些东西了，就连1962出生的夏叔也说，“我虽然在老家种了20多年的地，但现在我已经不习惯回家了，因为老家的生活太不方便了，城市太方便了。”在东北打工的文哥也曾提过，“家里的冬天太冷了，我很不适应，我在哈尔滨待了32年，那里虽然室外温度低，但室内都有暖气，很舒服。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;务农人Vs农民&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;不言而喻，至今都在老家务农的人只剩下杨奶奶这种40后，及像我父母一样的50后。随着孩子纷纷进城上学，很多妇女也加入了打工族，以及上世纪80年代改革开放初期就外出谋生的60后对城市生活的极大适应，往昔作为农村人口主要构成主体的“386199”部队，如今只剩下了孤独的“99”，对应的具体群体当是40后及50后。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我想表达，这群人是名副其实的“最后一代务农人”。特别指出，笔者并未使用“农民”这一概念。在我看来，“农民”“工人”等概念具有鲜明的政治与身份属性，“农民”一词使用语境里，经常存在若干对照群体，比如“农民对应哪个群体”“农民在农村，工人在城里”，其实不然，本质上，他们只是行业或职业分工的差异而已，不存在政治、身份等方面的分野或对立。同样，“工人”一词也存在类似情况。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;时过境迁，我们更愿意使用“打工人”“打工仔”“打工妹”“务农人”“农民工”等普通百姓耳熟能详与更容易接受的概念。不管是“务农人”，还是“打工人”，他们都是名副其实的产业工人（industrial workers/laborers）。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;务农人的技艺&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;既是“务农人”，这群高龄老人自然深谙务农或农村与农业的各项技术与技艺，他们打小对农业时令了如指掌，知道啥时候春耕，啥时候育苗，啥时候播种，啥时候施肥，啥时候除草，啥时候收割，用什么储藏农作物。他们知道拿灶膛或柴火堆里的灰烬作为肥料，也知道用人及鸡、猪等粪便作为农作物养料的重要补充，而不只是全部倚靠农药或化肥来提高土壤的肥力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他们会利用房前屋后的边角地种一点菜，或开垦山间布满石块或荒芜已久的闲置或废弃地种东西。建房子或选坟地前，他们会请风水先生看看；他们发明了夏天纳凉用的竹床、冬天取暖用的烘笼，夜里如厕用的夜壶。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他们中的很多人打小就是标准的农村匠人，如铁匠、漆匠、油匠、木匠、篾匠、裁缝、接生婆、赤脚医生、算命先生、巫医。村里改造时，他们提醒年轻人不要轻易移除村口的古木，强烈建议保留村中央的老祠堂。家人肚子疼、腹泻或有其他三病两痛时，他们会去田里寻来鱼腥草、艾叶，用来泡脚、泡澡，或烟熏，或煎水服用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;毫不夸张地说，他们熟悉或掌握的技艺，不胜枚举。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很显然，他们中的绝大部分人文化程度很低，文盲或半文盲的比例甚高，但无碍于他们对农业技术、乡村记忆与农业文明的深谙与熟稔。对于教科书或宣传标语里的循环经济、生态农业、集约与节约用地、非物质文化遗产等，他们或许不曾说过，也不懂怎么表达，但他们却一辈子在践行。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这道出了一个理儿，文化、文明经常或通常与文化程度关系不大，或不太大。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如实说，“最后一代务农人”对农业技术的传承、农业文明的赓续、家庭与家族的和谐、国家的城镇化与现代化作出了重大贡献。正是他们接续其先人与祖先，通过一代又一代人的传承，才令到农业文明得以发扬与传承；正是他们镇守老家与后方，才让其子女及其晚辈可以从容与放心地进城打拼，创造属于新一代人的新生活；正是他们及其子女的善良与拼搏，才缔造了中国低成本的工业化、城镇化与现代化奇迹。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;务农人的生活方式与价值观&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;于生活方式而言，“最后一代务农人”普遍具有勤俭节约的品格，比如吃东西尽量不浪费，做多少吃多少，人吃剩了的给猪狗鸡等家畜家禽吃，对子女出于孝顺与孝敬心的各种快递，他们虽倍感欣慰，但也偶有抱怨，会觉得子女花钱如流水，大手大脚。勤俭节约品格的习得与养成，固然与他们历经的那些至艰至难岁月有关，但在那个物质极度贫乏的年代，不节约、不节俭，就没有办法实现物质与财富积累，及资本积累。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这里的“资本积累”，不妨理解为“没有钱，交不起学费，孩子即便考上大学了也上不了大学，作为农村人最大的宏愿——&#39;跳出农门&#39;，以及日后的门庭显赫、光宗耀祖，自然也都无法兑现”。上述说法的假设是：子女是家里最重要的投资领域，对子女的培养支出就是投资成本，子女日后的发展及回报就是投资收益。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;价值观念方面，“最后一代务农人”非常“忘我”，“忘我”到极致。他们生命的全部意义在于贡献与奉献，很多人大半辈子或一辈子都在为别人活、为家人活。他们历经千辛万苦，一辈子被固着在土地上，没有或鲜有离开家乡，干了一辈子农活，所谓“面朝黄土背朝天”的精准所指就是他们这一代人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他们中的很多人打小就是家里的主要劳力，勤俭节省一辈子，盖房子，娶妻生子，然后节衣缩食抚养孩子成人，供孩子读书，待到孩子大了，还想着给孩子补贴一下，多少分担一下孩子在城里购房或结婚成家的压力。少部分人甚至忍受文化适应的煎熬，在耄耋之年依然选择进城给孩子做饭、接送孙子上学及放学，待到孙辈大了，他们才得以回家，回到他们习惯了一辈子的家。回家了，他们终于可以不用忙碌了，却发现早已落下一身病，有的人选择不告诉子女，怕用子女的钱，有的人干脆不去医院体检，担心一旦查出问题，给子女添堵。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;既然是“最后一代务农人”，那就是“末代”了，就如同很多已经和正在经历衰败与凋敝过程的村庄一样，时代的洪流不会因为他们辛苦或艰难就可怜他们，或留住他们。旧人退场，新人登场，从来就是历史发展与演迁之必然规律，没有人可以阻止。我们可以心生凄凉，但终究还需释怀。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;胡适之父胡传（号铁花）。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1895年，清政府割让台湾，胡适父亲胡传时任台东州知州，胡适回忆说其父因刘永福“不肯放行”耽误医治而死，学界大多给了一个“病死”的结论。笔者从张之洞门生袁昶的日记发现，胡传遭刘永福囚禁勒索，致病情加剧，在回厦门的船上业已身亡，刘永福最终放行，乃是袁昶请求张之洞干预的结果。1900年袁昶因直言被杀，为人忠直，其记载值得重视。袁昶的记载跟胡适的回忆内容一致，只是措辞稍有不同而已。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;胡适父亲官名胡传，字守三、守珊，号铁花，又号钝夫，一生经历曲折，曾北上宁古塔、南下海南黎区，最后做到台湾台东直隶州知州。长期以来，人们印象中胡传是病死的，胡适门生、整理《胡铁花遗稿》的著名学者罗尔纲也认同此说，持这种观点的不在少数。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;笔者也认为胡传是病死的，但他是被囚禁耽误治疗病情加剧而死，并非正常病死。胡适回忆道：“我父亲在台东办后山的防务，电报已不通，饷源已断绝，那时他已得脚气病，左脚已不能行动。他守到闰五月初三日，始离开后山，到安平时，刘永福苦口留他帮忙，不肯放行。到六月廿五日，他的双脚都不能动了，刘永福始放他行。六月廿八日到厦门，手足俱不能动了，七月三日他死在厦门。”（胡适《四十自述》）胡适后来补充说：“但我在《四十自述》里叙述先父之死，是由于脚气病，是可以医治的。先父原想赶到上海去求医，只因为刘永福不肯放行，耽误了近两个月，直到他病危了，才被放行。他六月廿八日到厦门，七月初三就死了。我的原意（也是我先兄和先母的意见），都觉得先父之死是由于刘永福的不肯放行。”（胡颂平《胡适之先生年谱长编初稿》第一册第27页）当日在胡传身边随侍的是胡适二哥绍之，也是他负责扶柩归乡，胡适所述情形应来自其二哥。胡适的补充极为重要，跟袁昶日记记载若合符节。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/8eG93hRZLCT8OzKR3OWQNDJHsCTfvSs2GHoZ85hf.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;584&quot; height=&quot;750&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/8eG93hRZLCT8OzKR3OWQNDJHsCTfvSs2GHoZ85hf.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255536&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;刘永福。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;读胡传《台湾日记》，他在五月初六日即上书唐景崧请求“开缺回籍治病”“得皖南道袁爽秋观察书，即复”。此条日记证明，胡说本人意向是回到大陆治病，他与袁昶经常有通信联络。袁昶此时的官职是安徽徽宁池广太道，简称“皖南道”，因驻扎芜湖，有时也简称“芜湖道”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在《袁昶日记》里面，胡传是被刘永福“囚禁之绝饮食”，导致病情恶化，在船上已去世，到厦门的只是一具尸体。袁昶为张之洞早年任浙江副主考时录取的门生。《历代日记丛钞》收录的袁昶《毗邪台山散人日记》与孙之梅标点本《袁昶日记》内容相同，是读书记与少量记事的节抄本。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据日记，光绪二十二年（1896）他遇到陈文騄（陈仲英），回忆起前一年的事。袁昶于1896年写道：“陈仲英曾守台南，谈次述亡友胡守三（传）官台东州牧，为总兵刘永福索贿二万，不得，囚禁之绝饮食。永福本降贼，真盗贼行径也。予去夏乞督部张公电诘刘，乃释胡州牧，渡台未至厦门，觞于海舶。盖愤恚不得伸其志而致病也。”（孙之梅整理《袁昶日记》下册第1224页）陈文騄1892年任台北知府，乙未曾驻守台南，五月遵旨内渡。陈文騄是胡传的同僚，他的为官经历使其证言具有不可代替的权威性，最接近历史现场。甲午、乙未张之洞署两江总督，芜湖道为两江总督下属。按日记说法，正是袁昶求张之洞致电刘永福释放胡传。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;晚清各督抚中，张之洞对乙未割台关注最深，台湾巡抚唐景崧，以及帮办台湾防务南澳镇总兵刘永福，都在中法战争期间受张之洞接济指挥，胡传则于1887年奉张之洞之命考察海南黎区。这三个人均与张之洞有较深渊源。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;乙未年间的台湾形势十分复杂。署两江总督张之洞表面上遵从朝廷割让台湾的决定，又曾暗中支持唐景崧、刘永福抗日保台，接济饷械，在收到朝廷电旨诘责后收手，让唐、刘二人自己决定取向。唐、刘二人，原有抗法名将美名，为盛名所误，初决定留台抗日，但军事实力难以持久，唐景崧很快潜返大陆，而刘永福则被人“遮留”。刘永福感觉被张之洞耍了，在多数地方官均已内渡的情况下，扣押台东州知州胡传索饷，也是无法之法。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘永福在断了大陆接济后，要取得军饷，向地方官索取是比较简便的方法。陈文騄所言“索贿”，笔者细读之下，觉得应理解为“索饷”比较合理。刘永福扣留胡传，“囚禁之绝饮食”，但胡传手中并无现款，当日军步步深入之时，筹饷也十分困难。芜湖道袁昶代为向张之洞求援，致电刘永福放人，胡传在返回厦门的船上去世。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;胡传因被刘永福囚禁断食，耽误治疗，病情恶化而死，并非正常病亡。中法战争期间，唐景崧主动请缨潜入越南，与刘永福并肩作战，对刘永福为人有比较深入的认识，1884通过云贵总督岑毓英上奏朝廷，说刘永福“视财太重、待下寡恩、毫无纪律”。（《张文襄公（未刊）电稿》第一册第91页）将此语与1895年对待胡传的方式联系起来，刘永福为人的另一面也就昭然若揭。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年10月23日在以色列斯代罗特拍摄的加沙地带北部遭以色列空袭后升起的浓烟&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（新华社/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;近日，以色列国会议员“塔利”·戈特利夫(Revital &quot;Tally&quot; Gotliv)竟然对媒体称，以色列应该使用核武器报复哈马斯对以色列发动的袭击。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;戈特利夫还在她的社交媒体上写道：“杰里科导弹！杰里科导弹！战略戒备。在考虑部队进入之前。末日武器（使用）！这是我的观点。愿上帝保佑我们所有的力量。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其后她又公开宣称“只有震撼中东的爆炸才能恢复这个国家（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;指以色列&lt;/span>;）的尊严、力量和安全！是时候亲吻世界末日了。无限制地发射强大的导弹。不要夷平一个街区，要粉碎和夷平整个加沙……毫不留情！毫不留情！”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;显然，这是彻头彻尾的核威胁。戈特利夫是一名律师，以色列总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡的反对者，其言论一直以极端和疯狂著称，所以她这次的极端言论也没有被任何人当作正经的核威胁看待。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而我们却不得不承认一个事实，那就是以色列确实是中东地区目前唯一一个拥有核武器的国家，并且在1973年赎罪日战争中几乎决定使用核武器挽回败局。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管现在有不少民间舆论认为，如果伊朗、黎巴嫩真主党等反以色列盟友共同参战，有望实现哈马斯彻底摧毁以色列的目标。但即便不考虑这些对手的常规军事力量加起来与以色列仍有差距，以及美国的两艘航母近在咫尺的事实，而只考虑以色列核力量的存在，如果出现以色列彻底战败的情况，这场战争也不排除可能升级为核战争。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那么现实中以色列是否已经做好了使用核武器的准备呢？要回答这个问题我们首先需要了解，以色列到底拥有什么样的核力量，以及它核战略的定位是什么？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由于以色列不接受国际原子能机构对其核设施的监管，且以色列政府一直执行模糊核战略，即不承认也不否认拥有核武器，未曾对外公布其核武器的部署情况，外界很难掌握以色列具体拥有多少核武器，以及核武器是否已经处于战备状态。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;国际军控研究界现在普遍认为，以色列拥有至少90枚核武器，并且还保存了可以制造200-300枚核武器的关键核材料。尽管以色列的核武器规模非常小，但却是极少数具备三位一体核打击能力的国家。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以色列拥有射程可以覆盖中东全境及非洲和亚洲部分地区的杰里科中程弹道导弹，该系统被认为是以色列陆基核打击力量的核心，其中最新的杰里科3型导弹射程可达4800公里，足以覆盖巴基斯坦首都伊斯兰堡甚至俄罗斯首都莫斯科。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以色列空军的F-16、F-15战机都具备搭载核炸弹的能力，外界甚至普遍认为以色列定制的F-35战机将会拥有投掷核炸弹的能力，预计以色列空军的武器库中至少拥有30枚左右类似美国B-61型的航空核炸弹，这是以色列先手核打击力量的核心，保持着非常高的战备水平，随时可以临空发动核攻击，对周边敌对国家威胁非常大。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以色列也是极少数拥有水下核力量的国家，尽管它并未装备核动力潜艇，然而已在其海军服役的海豚级常规动力潜艇装备了核巡航导弹，在以色列陆空军都不复存在的情况下，潜艇部队仍可执行末日打击任务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种三位一体的核打击能力，使得以色列虽然国土面积狭小，却拥有超越英法的核战斗力，是少数能对主要威慑目标实施先发制人核打击的国家。如果以色列确实面临灭国风险，最后时刻极有可能使用核武器孤注一掷。实际上，以色列的核威慑力量成型也是在第四次中东战争之后，这也是埃及等世俗阿拉伯国家决定与以色列关系正常化的战略考量之一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;戈特利夫议员宣称应对加沙使用核武器显然只是个人言论。无论以色列如何疯狂，核爆后的辐射尘埃对于近在咫尺的以色列而言，都是不能接受的灾难性后果。然而如果战事扩大，伊朗直接参战，那么以色列动用核武器却并非是不可能的选项。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年5月以色列曾与美国共同演习打击伊朗的核设施，而以色列的作战计划中很可能也包括在极端状况下对伊朗发动核打击的选项。这次哈马斯的袭击普遍被认为是赎罪日战争之后以色列所遭遇到的最糟糕状况，若1973年以色列有过实施核打击的准备，那么这次也不排除会有相关的预案。更糟糕的是，现在以军核武器的数量和使用手段已经远超当年。因此，国际社会对以色列准备动用核武器的可能性和危害性，应当有所戒备。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;于是，我就很高兴地给自己配了冰鲜海虾、文蛤和龙头鱼。店家问我要不要蛏子，我告知不吃蛏子，吃了会腹痛的，店家就拿着我选好的海鲜到后厨去了。我又想起俱乐部领队的提醒，去吃海鲜面要问清楚多少钱，她上次去吃没问被多收了不少，于是特地问了价格。老板顿了一下，说是48元。我有点小惊讶，心想，这海鲜面我今年一路吃下来从不超过30元的，现在一涨就涨了50%多？又一想，这48元也不是什么大数目，也就默认了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;等了一会儿，海鲜面上来了。我因为饿了，拿起筷子就吃，鲜没有尝出来，却吃出了很多的不对劲：怎么里面有蛏子？我选了三条十几厘米长的龙头鱼，怎么只有小小的三段？那个虾的壳怎么脆脆的，虾肉怎么干干的，不像冰鲜，倒像是晒干的？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我老公吃的是快餐，先于我吃好，吃好后就去付了钱。我吃过后，心有不甘，找老板理论，质疑他们食材掉了包。这下可好了，店里的三四个人围住我们，七嘴八舌，蛮横地否认我的质疑。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我问：“你们这家店谁做主？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我。”老板说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“那好，其他人闭嘴。我们和你交涉。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;老板问：“你想怎么办？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我说：“退我钱。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他问：“全退？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我想了想，说：“那倒也不是，面我也吃了，退20元。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;老板瞪大眼睛，提高嗓门：“什么？不可能的！你去投诉好了！”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;之前我真没有想到投诉，他这么一说，我也火了，直接拨打了12345热线电话。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大概一个小时后，我接到了一个电话，说是市场监管局的，已经到了现场，问我是不是投诉店家在海鲜面里多加了蛏子。我一听，大为惊讶，居然把食材掉包定性得这么清新脱俗，忙说，我把事情复盘给你吧。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;言简意赅地复述了一遍，对方说，等他核实一下再做处置。过了一会儿，电话来了，说是在后厨没有发现干虾，蛏子是后厨误放进去的，我这边也没有相应的证据，所以，不做处理。我道，不接受这样的结果，老板一开始就有恃无恐地让我“去投诉好了”，是不是吃定你们胳膊往里弯的？我要继续向上一级部门投诉。之前投诉的是：一、价格偏离市场行情，有宰客嫌疑；二、食材掉包；三、态度恶劣。如果你们坚持这样的态度，那么就再加一条：地方保护。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;50分钟后，电话来了，一是老板愿意就态度和弄错食材向我道歉，二是愿意退回20元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事情到了这里，是不是应该高兴一下？不不不，我一点都高兴不起来，吃一碗海鲜面味道不好不说，居然要打12345，市场监管人员还给你和个稀泥。虽说事情最终确实得到了处理，但我总觉得如果没有我的“威胁”，这事就会不了了之。如果事情的解决要靠这样的“威胁”才有推进，未免使人感到沮丧。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;12345，我一直信任有加，因为她的为人民服务的意识，因为她的高效的办事效率，因为她的事事有回应、件件有着落的作风。在我的这个投诉中，相应的职能部门人员一个多小时就赶到了现场，工作效率不谓不高。但如果就事论事，我觉得在这件事情的处置上，还是存在瑕疵的。如果存有公正之心，对本地商家不偏袒，对外地游客不敷衍，那么我也不会感到那么遗憾了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那天傍晚，我们来到了这个海岛的一个网红村子，看到有人在吃海鲜面，就问了价格，回说30元。做海鲜面的是一对年逾古稀的老夫妇，我问他们，海鲜面里放些什么海鲜，老妇人答曰，有活的虾，有蛏子，有文蛤，还有一个荷包蛋。我们愉快地叫了两碗海鲜面，里面的蛏子都归我老公吃，吹着海风，听着海涛，看月亮一点点升上来，这个感觉，很好。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在我们吃面的时间里，我看到这对老夫妇卖出了十几碗面。我粗略算了算，一碗面的成本大致10元，这样一天他们的收入还是蛮可观的。一碗30元的海鲜面，店家有得赚，游客能接受，多和谐的生态！想不通有些商家为什么还要宰客，宰着宰着不怕把自己的生意给宰没了？&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（作者为退休教师）&lt;/p>;
