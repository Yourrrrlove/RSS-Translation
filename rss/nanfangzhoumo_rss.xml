In this small book, the format of which is made like a record cover, he said that he has visited record stores around the world in the past 60 years and bought more than 10,000 old records. He specially selected some of his favorites. , write down why you like it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Murakami stated clearly at the outset that this book &quot;is at best a book of personal preferences and interests, without any systematic or practical purpose, and there is no such thing as &#39;This is a must-listen to this piece of music!&#39;&quot; recommendation intention”. This book is like a continuation of the earlier &quot;Murakami T&quot;. Readers like Haruki Murakami very much and want to know what clothes he wears and what records he listens to, that&#39;s all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, every piece of classical music has countless recording versions. Different conductors, orchestras, performance times, and even the same piece of music but different recording and pressing techniques make each record version unique. . In today&#39;s vast number of streaming music platforms, there are only the tip of the iceberg with different recorded versions. When reading this book by Murakami, I always think: Ah! It turns out that this song also has this version, and I really want to listen to it. However, it is not easy to retrieve the records introduced in the book according to the diagram. After all, many of the records introduced by Murakami in the book were produced in the 1950s and 1960s. You can either try your luck in old record stores or You can go to the famous record trading website discogs to hunt for treasures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Murakami said that his choice of records is based on personal preference, so many classical music fans have opinions on his choice, but when it comes to personal preference, naturally everyone has what they like. different. Just like Murakami himself said that he doesn&#39;t like pianist Alfred Brendel very much, but Brendel is liked by many people. Which version and conductor you like is often related to your own experience. Since Murakami is a good friend with the famous conductor Seiji Ozawa, he naturally prefers Ozawa Seiji’s version. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beyond personal experience, another reason is the preference for interpretation of music. Sometimes musicians’ interpretation of music is very distinctive (even to the point of sensationalism), and music fans do not pay the price (or The reason why I like it (in turn) is relatively easy to explain. For example: Mahler&#39;s Seventh Symphony, if you listen to Otto Klemperer&#39;s version (compared to most versions, the whole piece is almost 20 minutes long), the extremely slow style feels like Watching the train in the distance enter the platform, the train gradually approaches but always seems to never arrive. Some people say this is a kind of tension, but I don&#39;t like it very much. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No matter what, Murakami always has his own unique approach when writing these music reviews, so that even if readers are just reading Murakami’s short reviews of classical records, they still have the pleasure of reading Haruki Murakami’s words. For example, he said that Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 25 recorded by pianist Friedrich Gulda with the Vienna Philharmonic (conducted by Abbado) sounded “like eating clear soup udon at an Osaka udon shop” Such an incredible sense of security&quot;; or when Sir Thomas Beecham conducts Haydn&#39;s Symphony No. 94, there is always an impression of &quot;a graceful old-time British gentleman, even the &#39;surprise&#39; part of the second movement, The method of frightening is also steady and elegant. Even a woman holding a tea cup will not be frightened to the point where the black tea will overflow.&quot; These metaphors are very unique and very Haruki Murakami. How could Mozart or Gulda ever think that his work would turn into a bowl of Osaka&#39;s clear soup udon? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, back to an important question: Why listen to vinyl records when listening to classical music now? Or the bigger question is: How can vinyl records be brought back to life? The return of vinyl records is one of the most inspiring stories in the history of human development. It has obviously been obsolete by the times, heavy and fragile, and has a pitiful carrying capacity, but facts have proved that as long as it is valuable, even if it is full of shortcomings, it still has the meaning of existence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Haruki Murakami said in &quot;Murakami&#39;s Private Collection: Nostalgic and Beautiful Classical Music Records&quot; that listening to vinyl records is &quot;the kind of thing that will respond as long as you treat it carefully.&quot; In an age where everything is digital, giving and responding have long become a very formal exchange. Everything is just a button in exchange for a reaction, and the satisfaction gained by giving with heart has been lost. Just like no matter how carefully and gently you touch the streaming music platform on your mobile phone to play music, there will never be any difference in the music played (so in fact, we naturally don’t touch our mobile phones so gently). The quality of &quot;responsiveness&quot; has become rare in today&#39;s cold world, which is why vinyl records are enjoying a renaissance today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When listening to vinyl records, from buying the record to playing it, every step requires &quot;careful treatment&quot;. One of them is audio playback. Whether listening to vinyl records or streaming platforms, it is a knowledge as deep as the sea. For example, the most basic turntable, pre- and post-amplifiers (audio amplifiers), speakers, or the cartridge and stylus used in the turntable, the wires and connectors for connecting the equipment, and even the record pads on the turntable for placing records, are all very particular. Haruki Murakami also said that audio is a &quot;hobby that can only be cultivated if you have some spare time. There is nothing you can do about it, you can only have this awareness.&quot; Having said that, as long as you don&#39;t buy an all-in-one playback turntable that only costs a few hundred yuan and only looks good, a simple set of decent entry-level audio equipment is actually affordable, and it can already reflect the preciousness of vinyl records. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not just audio equipment, buying (and finding) vinyl discs is also an activity that requires dedication. In places like Europe and the United States, there are stores selling second-hand items such as The Salvation Army and Lexi Club in different communities. In these thrift stores, there will always be a corner filled with boxes of old records. If there are some responsible people, The store clerk (or the neater owner) will sort the records and put them away. At this time, slowly squat down, flip through the records one by one, and take a look. Each one is unknown, and you can meet your favorites at any time. These old records are often only priced at ten yuan or eighty yuan, which is incredibly cheap. Unlike other used record stores, these used stores are non-profit-making. The people in charge do not have time to set prices slowly, and they usually do not understand the market and the value of the goods like an insider. So, it’s easy to find treasures in these thrift stores. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the records bought at thrift stores are in different states. It usually takes more time to clean them properly, and sometimes you get damaged records. There is no way to avoid these, so you have to Check carefully when buying. But as Haruki Murakami said, even if it is an old record, as long as it is cleaned carefully (cleaning records is also knowledgeable), there will still be a significant difference in the playback sound quality before and after cleaning. At least the stylus will not accumulate accumulation after the record is played. A pile of dirt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In comparison, stores that specialize in old records often do basic cleaning of the records and clearly indicate the condition and quality of the records. Correspondingly, the prices will be correspondingly expensive. Comparing different record stores around the world, Japanese record stores tend to be the neatest and cleanest. No wonder my good friend, Mr. Jiao Yuanpu, said that when he goes to a second-hand record store in Japan, he spends 7 hours every time there, and he goes there from dawn to dusk. Listening to his sharing, it is a very big sacrifice in terms of both mental and financial resources. Of course, it will be rewarded with a bumper harvest every time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[大城府：泰国那一抹“永恒的微笑”丨古国多少事⑦]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257366]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-06 17:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;h4>;Dark red ocean&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, whether you charter a car from Khao San Road in Bangkok or take a train to make an appointment For an hour, when you can see the spiers and the splendid street signs in the distance, the strong historical atmosphere will come to you - Ayutthaya is located on the alluvial plain of the Chao Phraya River, above the tide line of the Gulf of Siam, surrounded by the Mekong River. Surrounded by the Nan River, the Lopburi River and the Pasak Canal, it forms a unique island city. There are waterways leading to the Gulf of Siam in the south, which can connect China and Southeast Asian countries. It also tightly controls the sea gateway of Sukhothai in the north, becoming a gateway for China, India, and The geographical connection point between Europe and the United States also gave it unique conditions in trade, military, and diplomacy: from the 14th to the 18th century, its developed water and land transportation and dazzling Buddhist architecture made its reputation famous in Southeast Asia and even the entire Asia, and was even regarded as Southeast Asia. The largest and most beautiful city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/t0o7trafKMIk2PsnCo9PrdxkPIBcspxi8gj5WHEH.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/t0o7trafKMIk2PsnCo9PrdxkPIBcspxi8gj5WHEH.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;199733&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Buddha statues and relics at Wat Mahathat&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Yameng/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 1350, the leader of the Luo Zhen (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;now Lopburi&lt;/span>;) regime on the west bank of the Chao Phraya River was Ramathetbodhi (&lt;span style=&quot;font -family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Ramathibodi I, King Uthong&lt;/span>;) defeated Thailand&#39;s first feudal dynasty, the Sukhothai dynasty, and Luo Zhen merged with Siam, the Supan regime on the east bank of the river, to establish A The Yudaya Dynasty is called &quot;Siam&quot; in Chinese historical records. When Bangkok was still a little-known fishing village, the capital of the Ayutthaya Dynasty was already a prosperous &quot;big city&quot; - Chinese people in Thailand thought this city was the largest, so it was called &quot;Ayutthaya&quot;, and even the dynasty was also called &quot;Ayutthaya Dynasty&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In historical documents, Ayutthaya is called &quot;Paradise&quot;. At its peak, the population was about 1 million. Three royal palaces, more than 2,000 gilded minaret temples and more than 4,000 gilded Buddha statues made this place full of charm. The dynasty, which lasted 33 kings and lasted for 417 years, brought Buddhist culture to its peak. In the middle and late period of the Ayutthaya Dynasty, Zhang Xie of the Ming Dynasty also wrote in his &quot;Siam Articles&quot; in &quot;The Examination of Eastern and Western Oceans&quot;: &quot;The soil is wet underneath, the climate is hot and humid, and the people live in high-rise buildings. The rattan system is very strong, with rattan mats and bamboo mats for sleeping in the middle. The palace is more than nine feet high, decorated with gold and carved with eight trigrams, which is extremely magnificent.&quot; Beginning in the 16th century, Ayutthaya&#39;s reputation spread far and wide to Europe, in 1512 The Portuguese first arrived here in 1988, and Ayutthaya gradually became a trade center in the 17th century, with envoys from various European countries arriving in droves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the main color of Ayutthaya a few hundred years ago was gold, now here, to be more arbitrary, the city center only has two colors: reddish brown and burnt black: reddish brown is the dusty bricks of the building. Scorched by the scorching sun and eroded by wind and rain, the uneven floors and walls turned into a dark red ocean. Many ancient temples in Ayutthaya appear to be replicas of Angkor Wat at first glance, but after careful inspection, you will find that unlike Angkor temples, which are mostly made of large stones, red bricks are mostly used here; there are no carved walls, There are thousands of corridors here, but many unique architectural styles of the Ayutthaya Dynasty are derived here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wat Lokaya Sutha (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wat Lokaya Sutha&lt;/span>;) can no longer be called a &quot;temple&quot;. In a piece of overgrown grass, a huge reclining Buddha is exposed in nature to accept worship; the Wat Phra Si San Phet built in 1491 (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wat Phra Si San Phet (Temple of the Three Kings) The three remaining white Ceylon-style pagodas are lined up in a row and have become landmarks in Ayutthaya: In 1492, in order to enshrine the ashes of his father and brother, Rama Tepbodhi II built two pagodas in the temple. The pagoda started Thailand&#39;s funeral custom of using pagodas to store the king&#39;s ashes. In 1529, when Ramathebodhi II died, his son built another pagoda. Today, time has not completely destroyed them. Although the many small towers built by successive kings nearby are seriously damaged, they are still majestic and towering, like solemn guards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To the east of Wat Pasi Sangbi is the Rajapurana Temple (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312) which is famous for the magnificent pagoda in the main courtyard. , STKaiti;&quot;>;Wat Ratchaburana&lt;/span>;). This Khmer-style pagoda was originally Thai-style. It was built by the ninth king to hold the cremation for his two brothers who died in a duel for succession to the throne: in 1424, King Indraja died, and the two brothers fought each other on elephants. After the death of the first prince, the third son inherited the throne from Phitsanulok and became Borommarachathirat II (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Borommarachathirat II&lt;/span>;). This temple houses the ashes of my brother. After passing through the gate with only one wall left like Ruins of St. Paul&#39;s, you are surrounded by fragmented Buddha statues and walls, as if you suddenly fell into the distant ancient times. On the main tower, which looks like a stick of corn, there are layers of corrugated tower decorations; surrounded by four small Ceylon-style towers, it is the most complete Khmer-style pagoda in the city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The oldest temple in the city is in the southeast corner outside the moat, Wat Yai Chaiyamongkho (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wat Yai Chaiyamongkho&lt;/span >;) Built in 1357 by King Utong to commemorate the birth of the dynasty. Different from the ruined temples in the city that are full of vicissitudes of life, traces of reconstruction can be seen everywhere here, but they do not make people feel obtrusive. They are not even as good as the yellow silk draped in the pagoda. The visual contrast with the mottled red bricks is strong. The 28-meter-long white reclining Buddha is the symbol here. Wearing a yellow cassock, he lies peacefully on his side under the hot white sun, looking indifferently at the weather-beaten land and rivers around him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Climb up to the Ceylon-style main tower. There are eight Buddha statues inside. What is even more unforgettable is that a strange mixed smell permeates it. The smell of gunpowder smoke is mixed with the smell of decaying plants, and more of the human body stench. , making it difficult to breathe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/O8ZavUlGZts4QzA5JEiQYYEJ6WNcHmgpnydEoF4Q.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/O8ZavUlGZts4QzA5JEiQYYEJ6WNcHmgpnydEoF4Q.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;199731&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chaiwatthanaram Temple, the back of the Buddha statue&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Yameng/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt; h4>;The dark reflection of prosperity&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When the tourists disappeared, only a piece of tranquility washed over the years remained around the reclining Buddha in Yacha Mengkong Temple - around the main tower, many headless Buddha statues stood silently , seeming not to want to tell the story of their experiences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The name of Ayutthaya comes from the birthplace of Rama in the Indian epic &quot;Ramayana&quot; and the place where Rama ascended the throne after his triumphant return (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family : Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Ayodhya&lt;/span>;), Sanskrit means &quot;the invincible city&quot; or &quot;the city of eternal victory&quot;, but this name is just like the prophecy: as the second largest city after the Khmer Empire A &quot;superpower&quot; in Southeast Asia, when the Ayutthaya Dynasty reached its peak, the war between it and Myanmar also continued. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All glory must come to an end. In 1766, King Meng Bo of Myanmar, who had coveted Ayutthaya for a long time, led his army to siege the city for 14 months. After 14 months of siege, he blew down the city wall and entered the city. After 15 days of burning, killing and looting, 30,000 people were taken prisoner and Ayutthaya was almost razed to the ground. Flat ground. The invincible city was destroyed in the war - the longest dynasty in the history of the Kingdom of Thailand, with all its splendor, came to an abrupt end in 1767, leaving only a dozen temples that had been &quot;washed away from the glory&quot;. ——There are many black fire stains on the red bricks, and the Buddha statues were also blackened by the flames. They stood silently in the city, testifying to the golden age of the Ayutthaya Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Ayutthaya, the opposite of red is black. South of the Rajapurana Temple, Wat Mahathat (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wat Mahathat&lt;/span>;) is said to be the primary target of the Burmese army&#39;s attack on Thailand: This monastery was built in 1374 during the reign of King Borommarachathirat I (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Borommarachathirat I&lt;/span>;) and had 10 In the remaining monasteries, there are more than 200 pagodas like a jungle. Now only the huge square pagoda base is left in the middle of the temple, and many of the smaller pagodas are seriously tilted and crumbling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/6195U6sn6f8c0tGvvLkiR9ucZIqb3IjpSLOsZU80.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/6195U6sn6f8c0tGvvLkiR9ucZIqb3IjpSLOsZU80.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;199735&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Rows of headless Buddha statues at Chaiwatthanaram Temple&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Yameng/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;In Ayutthaya temples, many of the Buddha statues &quot;sitting in rows&quot; have no heads. A pair of stone Buddha feet or a huge Buddha hand will be &quot;surprised&quot; in the corner on the ground. The look is very &quot;post-modern&quot; &quot;. Perhaps for this reason, many tourists like to bend their knees and hide behind the Buddha statue, and stick their heads out from the broken neck of the Buddha statue to take pictures. In fact, the Buddha statues and pagodas in Wat Mahathat were plated with gold or contained gold leaves, which led the Burmese army to behead the Buddha statues or burn them in fires, causing the gold to separate from the stone, causing expansion and contraction of the Buddha statues&#39; heads. , hands and feet were broken, leaving the remains of limbs and arms devastated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ayutthaya is like the Old Summer Palace. The sunlight paints the high tower of Wat Chaiwatthanaram (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wat Chaiwatthanaram&lt;/span>;) in golden color, giving the red bricks a fierce beauty. , taking people back to the war-torn era. When the red has turned to black, the pagoda stands alone. The mottled pagodas, broken brick walls, dark Buddha statues, and vast monuments ruthlessly cover up the prosperity and destruction. Only the remaining documents and oral stories are passed down from generation to generation, and the years are like a passing cloud - -The prosperity of the prosperous times will also become the reflection of disillusionment, just like the long-lasting lonely back of the Buddha statue sitting high on the almost collapsed base in Chaiwatthanaram Temple in the sunset. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the army invaded, the Buddhist temples were completely destroyed. Wherever the knife fell, as the writer Ondajie said, &quot;the towering Buddha image with profound meaning fell to the ground and fell into the soil.&quot; Over a long period of time, a Buddha&#39;s head was tightly wrapped by the thousand-year-old Bodhi root, and the surrounding branches and vines entangled it, forming the wonder of a tree wrapping the Buddha&#39;s head. It is also the most famous &quot;eternal smile&quot; of Wat Mahathat. . Just like the &quot;endgame&quot; of the view of Ta Prohm Temple in Angkor Wat, the strangulation phenomenon of trees in Southeast Asia will eventually cause plants to replace their hosts. However, the Buddha statue is still smiling in the Bodhi tree with his eyes closed and saying nothing, as if he has watched the changes in the dynasty. , it is a kind of magical demeanor that is with everything and transcends life and death, allowing people to stand in front of it and stare at it for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/lmZSQApUZC6H2cHR93AVBJ73b6xdvLXGmP79YlDz.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;1280&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/lmZSQApUZC6H2cHR93AVBJ73b6xdvLXGmP79YlDz.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;199732&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The wonder of the Buddha head wrapped in a tree at the Mahathat Temple&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Yameng/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;Thousands of people spent time building the Ayutthaya City, and the Ayutthaya City watched the world created by these thousands of people in the light and shadow. After the fall of the Ayutthaya dynasty, Taksin moved the Thai capital nearly 100 kilometers south to Thonburi. After only 15 years of the Thonburi dynasty, the Bangkok dynasty established its capital in Bangkok in 1782, writing prosperity on the new land, and Ayutthaya was Fading out of people&#39;s sight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than two hundred years have passed by, and now it is more like a small town full of rural atmosphere and leisure atmosphere. In the ruins park, lawns, green trees, and ponds create an idyllic scene; locals will spread out mats for picnics, or rent traditional costumes to imitate the popular TV series &quot;A Match Made in Heaven&quot; that was filmed here, and take photos in the ruins. The red and black ruins are close to the newly built houses and temples. The fireworks and water blend among the ruined bricks and stones, giving a sense of astonishment as if you have traveled through time and space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/x7hi1VxguExowXr794aIulu9kB1uHbU8QeHdUO1p.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/x7hi1VxguExowXr794aIulu9kB1uHbU8QeHdUO1p.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;199734&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Elephant on the lawn of Bangbain Summer Palace&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Yameng/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;Between Ayutthaya and Bangkok, Bang Pa-In Summer Palace was built in the 17th century (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Bang Pa-In Summer Palace&lt;/span>; ) is the largest and most beautiful royal palace in Thailand.

In many cases, it can reflect the history and present of a society. , China and foreign countries are no exception. Everyone who has traveled to Europe will have experienced the toilet dilemma. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are generally very few public toilets in European countries, and it is often only possible to find one within a few kilometers, so there are apps for finding toilets in Europe. In contrast, in China, the function of finding toilets is covered by map apps. It is not a popular feature and cannot support an APP alone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to being cheap, toilets in Europe also charge a fee. In many European countries, such as the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and other places, you have to pay to use public toilets. For example, most of the toilets in high-speed service areas or shopping malls in Germany have to pay. Even the toilets in fast food restaurants, shopping malls, train stations, McDonald&#39;s, and KFC are charged. For example, in Cologne, Germany, there is a fee for using the toilets inside McDonald&#39;s. For another example, a KFC in Poland posted a notice: The restrooms in the store are only available to customers. People without consumption receipts need to pay 30 zloty (approximately 53 yuan) if they want to use the restroom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also various forms of charging. There is a person sitting at the door to collect the fee, there is a gate that rotates after a coin is inserted, and some are trustworthy and put a tip tray. In some stores, the toilet door has a password, and the password is printed on the shopping receipt. Not every floor of German department stores has restrooms. They are usually located near the restaurant floor on the top floor. Using the restrooms is generally free, but if there are cleaners there, a tip of about 0.3 euros is usually required. If you are in a tourist area, we will also thoughtfully provide exchange rate conversion, and the prices in each country&#39;s currency are clearly marked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The charges for European toilets are not cheap. The last trip to the toilet costs as little as 0.3 Euros and as much as 2 Euros. 1 euro is equivalent to 7.7 yuan, which is equivalent to between 2 yuan and 15 yuan. Even if the income is higher, going to the toilet in Europe is really not cheap. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As one of the richest regions in the world, Europe is also a region with the most complete &quot;social welfare&quot;. Why are there so few free public toilets? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, it’s because of history. In many European cities, such as London, England, Stockholm, Sweden, and Paris, France, there are semi-open open-air toilets on the streets. It wraps the lower body but can only be used by men. These open-air urinals are used very frequently in the local area. This strange street urinal has been around in Europe for nearly 200 years. This also reflects the historical origin of the lack of public toilets in Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a result of this historical path, people may not regard public toilets as a government obligation. In fact, public toilets in many places in Europe are basically privatized. In this case, solve the problem according to market thinking. Toilets require regular maintenance and repairs, and you also need to hire someone to clean them. Most European countries are developed countries, and labor costs are high. This has resulted in high maintenance costs for toilets. Businesses are unwilling to include it in a package of services, but charge separately. supply. Private toilets in European cafes, small bars and other commercial places assume some functions of public toilets. Of course, you must consume food first and then use the toilet. Europeans are also accustomed to paying to use public toilets, or go to a coffee shop to buy a cup of coffee to solve their internal problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The situation in European countries is not exactly the same. In Denmark, which has high taxes and high welfare, the government believes that the freedom to use public toilets is a public service that the government must meet. Therefore, in the urban area of ​​Copenhagen, the capital city with a small population, there are sufficient public toilets, good environment, and they are free. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Chinese toilets also used to charge fees. From the late 1970s to the late 1980s, as the economy developed, cities in China began to build higher-grade public toilets one after another, implementing water flushing and mechanical pumping. As the level of public toilets has improved, the cost has also increased. Some cities have begun to charge for public toilets to alleviate the shortage of funds for public toilet construction and management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the 20th century, with the further development of the economy, Chinese people began to have higher requirements for toilets. New residential areas were built, and toilets were increased from one to two bathrooms. However, public toilets are not free so early. In mid-tier cities like Qingdao, public toilets were not open for free until May 1, 2008, which is only 15 years ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Free public toilets, after all, the government has money. After years of accumulation of reform and opening up, especially after joining the WTO, the economy has developed rapidly, real estate has taken off, and local governments have obtained sufficient funds from land finance, so they are able to bear the entire cost of public toilets. Therefore, free public toilets in China are mainly the result of economic development. Whether to charge or not is closely related to the economic situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Toilet charges are essentially a matter of government revenue and the scope of government public services. If the situation of public toilets in Europe is very bad, it is because of historical, cultural and customary reasons. Society has also developed various alternative forms and people have adapted to them. In some countries, the benefit of free public toilets has never appeared, and naturally it is not felt much. But if you return from free to paid again, you will have a different perception. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;

As a player from China, Li Meng leads all rookies in three-point shooting percentage, hitting a total of 44 three-pointers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Washington Mystics general manager Mike Thibault said of Li Meng: &quot;She is the leading scorer of the Chinese women&#39;s basketball team and an excellent outside player who has the ability to help the ball with her excellent three-pointers. The team opens up the space.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Same words were said by Yao Ming, chairman of the Chinese Basketball Association and former NBA superstar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/P1tI2RAa6wA6jgwdOPgOOw0Wp8gUNSGI97O58L3H.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/P1tI2RAa6wA6jgwdOPgOOw0Wp8gUNSGI97O58L3H.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253084&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 5, 2023, in the women’s final of the basketball event at the Hangzhou Asian Games, Chinese team player Li Meng (front right) shot a shot during the game&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa; &quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 2022 Women&#39;s Basketball World Cup, Li Meng averaged 16 points per game and was the highest scorer on the team, although she ended up missing due to illness. Able to participate in the semi-finals and finals, the Chinese women&#39;s basketball team still won the silver medal. Yao Ming said in an interview after the game, &quot;The results achieved this time can be said to exceed expectations, but the growth of a team certainly does not happen overnight. In fact, many people on the team began to emerge 10 years ago, such as the main scorer. Li Meng already achieved good results when he participated in the World Youth Championship in the National Youth Team.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Meng started playing basketball at the age of 5. At first, he was rejected by the coach because he was too young and was difficult to coach. At her mother&#39;s insistence, she started practicing dribbling on the sidelines. There is a competitive side to her character. She could not grab the ball from the coach&#39;s hand. After being pointed out, she dared to &quot;fall to the ground and grab it&quot; and she actually hit the ball. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/ST1n4DyBXt93N6XobeOyOo1g3u4AHmZt4G1mcNti.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/ST1n4DyBXt93N6XobeOyOo1g3u4AHmZt4G1mcNti.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253082&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 5, 2023, in the women&#39;s final of the basketball event at the Hangzhou Asian Games, Chinese team player Li Meng (left) communicates with teammate Han Xu&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa; &quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the age of 5, she didn’t know what basketball could bring to herself, she just thought it was fun. &quot;But when you get in touch with it slowly, you like it and it turns into love, and it continues to this day.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2010, young Li Meng became a blockbuster at the U17 Youth World Cup Basketball Tournament. At that time, the Chinese team finished third, and at the age of 15, she won the tournament&#39;s Most Valuable Player (MVP) title by averaging 15.4 points and 6.2 rebounds per game, becoming the first player in Chinese history to win this honor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no smooth road. Li Meng, who has just emerged, has been plagued by injuries from ruptured anterior cruciate ligaments in both legs. Injuries have always been a problem that every athlete has to overcome, but for the teenage Li Meng, it was indeed a solid blow. &quot;Actually, it was okay after the first injury, but after the second injury, I started to think about whether this path would not be suitable for me.&quot; She told her mother that she wanted to go to school, but the coach felt it was a pity and rushed Come to persuade. After months of arduous recovery, she was able to return to competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 2012 to 2013, Li Meng landed in the WCBA. In his rookie season, he averaged 14.7 points, 3.9 rebounds and 1.5 assists per game, and was awarded the Rookie of the Year. In the following years, she was always the top scorer in the WCBA. However, due to her personal characteristics of strong offense and weak defense, she missed the 12-man national team roster led by Maher and missed the 2016 Rio Olympics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/B2KEJKf7PkXLw1WLrhShsBHJDFvy3Wu6Vv61me5s.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;632&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/B2KEJKf7PkXLw1WLrhShsBHJDFvy3Wu6Vv61me5s.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253079&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 1, 2022, in the 2022 Women&#39;s Basketball World Cup finals in Sydney, Australia, the Chinese team lost to the United States and won the runner-up.

He specifically approached Li Meng to emphasize the defensive issue, &quot;If you want to be the world&#39;s top athlete, you must be both offensive and defensive.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Meng took this advice to heart. By the time of the Tokyo Olympics, she had become an indispensable main player of the women&#39;s basketball team. She said, &quot;In the past, my physical strength may have been 50% on offense and defense, but now my physical strength on defense can reach 80%.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because With her outstanding physical fitness and all-round performance on the court, Li Meng is called the &quot;LeBron Dream&quot; by fans, and LeBron James has been her idol for many years. &quot;His professionalism, technology, leadership, and psychological quality, He is a role model among players and I have been learning from him.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/z3MVMri8BnHbR8sfbwcAdzgTJyMnaK6oKafkG00P. jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;683&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/z3MVMri8BnHbR8sfbwcAdzgTJyMnaK6oKafkG00P.jpg&quot; data-key= &quot;253080&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 2, 2023, in the 2023 Women&#39;s Basketball Asian Cup finals held in Sydney, Australia, the Chinese team won Defeated Japan 73-71 and won the championship.

At 19:00 on October 5, Beijing time, the winner was announced, Can Xue lost. But this does not mean that the odds have no reference value. In fact, Norwegian writer Jon Fother ranks second after Can Xue on this odds list. Unlike Gurner, the 2021 winner, Fauser is not an unpopular choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the more than 100-year history of the Nobel Prize for Literature, only 17 female writers have won the prize, and 8 of them won the prize in the 21st century, including the American female poet Glück in 2020 and French female writer Ernault in 2022. Undoubtedly, the Swedish Academy, which has been questioned by public opinion, is turning its attention more and more to outstanding female authors. Therefore, Can Xue still has a good chance of winning this award in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The citation for the award was &quot;for his innovative plays and essays that give voice to the ineffable&quot;. Fosse&#39;s award &quot;quite reasonably follows the tradition of the Nobel Prize in Literature not forgetting outstanding playwrights, from Maeterlinck, Shaw, and Beckett to Dario Foe, Pinter, and Handke. It is quite brilliant. Even more convincing than the list of novelists,&quot; poet and critic Liao Weitang told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eon Fosse is one of the most famous figures in contemporary theater and a popular candidate for the Nobel Prize in recent years. His works also cover poetry, novels, essays, children&#39;s literature and translations. Fother&#39;s plays have been staged thousands of times around the world, including &quot;The Girl on the Sofa&quot; in China in 2004 and &quot;One Summer&quot; produced by the Shanghai Dramatic Art Center. Fosse once watched his own play &quot;Somebody&#39;s Coming&quot; in Shanghai and felt that it was one of the best stage presentations of his work in the world, and he developed a respect for Chinese drama and Chinese culture. Fother&#39;s honors include the Scandinavian National Theater Award (2002), the Norwegian Arts Council Honor Award (2003), the Swedish Academy&#39;s Nordic Prize (2007), and the International Ibsen Prize (2010). ). The work &quot;New Title: Heptata 6-7&quot; was shortlisted for the 2022 International Booker Prize. Anders Olsen, chairman of the Nobel Prize Committee for Literature, said his works &quot;touch upon your deepest feelings, anxieties, insecurities, questions of life and death.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fosse was born in Haugesund on the west coast of Norway on September 29, 1959. He began his creative career at the age of twelve, which he calls &quot;ashamingly early&quot;. Fosse loved to play guitar and at one time was in a rock band. Translator Zou Lulu believes that &quot;his early musical experience brought a unique Fother-like color and style to his later writing - a strong sense of rhythm and musicality in his dramatic language.&quot; Since the late 1970s, Fosse has lived in Bergen, Norway&#39;s second largest city and the country&#39;s cultural capital. In recent years, he has also gone to southern France and Austrian towns on the outskirts of Vienna to write. Fosse is very energetic and often starts writing at four or five o&#39;clock in the afternoon and works until nine o&#39;clock the next morning. When asked if he had any advice for writing, he said: &quot;Write, don&#39;t think! Think before you write, think after you finish, but don&#39;t think about anything while writing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About En Fauser&#39;s earliest reading memory is a small book. In the book, a major felt that his town needed a fire truck, and then he and some citizens built it. It looked more like what children built out of wood. Car. “I used wood to build cars when I was a kid,” Fosse said. He admired Trakl, Kafka and Beckett, and at the same time, Beckett was an important object of &quot;resistance&quot; when he wrote dramas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fosse uses a rare language, &quot;New Norwegian&quot;. Even in Norway, which has a population of only more than five million, its speakers only account for one-tenth of the total population. Fortunately, New Norwegian can be easily understood by Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish speakers. But it is with the help of translation that Fosse&#39;s works are known to more readers. Currently, his books have been translated into more than forty languages. At first, he only wanted to write poems and novels. In 1993, he was invited to write his first script because he was short of money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, there are John Fother&#39;s drama selections &quot;Somebody&#39;s Coming&quot; and &quot;Autumn Dreams&quot; published by Shanghai Translation Publishing House. Wenjing is about to publish &quot;Trilogy&quot;, one of Fosse&#39;s masterpiece novels. This work won the Nordic Council Literary Award in 2015 and demonstrates his cold, solemn and concise epic style. The novel contains three closely connected parts: &quot;Awakening&quot;, &quot;Olav&#39;s Dream&quot; and &quot;Tiredness&quot;. The story begins with the young lovers Asle and Alida leaving their hometown for Björgven (the city of Bergen). Alida is about to give birth, but the couple has difficulty finding a place to live. They later found a place to live and gave birth to a son, Sigvald, who began to adopt different names, Olav and Åsta. But someone recognized Asler, and it was very clear that Asler and Alida seemed to be carrying murder cases, although Asler might have acted out of helplessness. Asler was eventually hanged. In the last part, the story time advances to the life of Asler and Alida&#39;s daughter Ales. By this time Ales is already an old woman. She recalls her sister who died young and herself. His brother Sigvald left him when he was young...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Wan, the editor-in-chief of &quot;Trilogy&quot;, is a young writer and translator. In her opinion, John Fother&#39;s After the work was introduced to China, it has not attracted widespread attention from readers, and even senior readers rarely know about him. &quot;Fosse is not an issue-oriented writer. He has very consistently inherited the Nordic expressionist drama tradition. His language is concise and full of tension. His profound depiction of the character&#39;s spirit and his analysis of the relationship between people have reached a very high level. He will not write about trivial daily life, but pay attention to people&#39;s mental state.&quot; Li Wan told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;The protagonist of Fosse&#39;s work is somewhat similar to himself. He is an alcoholic. He has some mental problems and has many extreme fringe experiences. He faces his own heart very directly and exposes himself. He is a writer who can share with others the most helpless side of a person.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;With this, At the same time, Jon Fother has developed a unique style of writing. Periods are rarely used. A sentence is often very, very long. He uses many commas to connect it, giving people the feeling that the inner monologue is constantly rolling forward. This may not be the case. Due to the sensitivity of a playwright, he brings dramatic elements into the novel. In addition, he will use some repetitive sentences in different parts of the novel, but this repetition is not exactly the same, but changes with the changing context and the change of words. Subtle changes produce variations and variations, bringing a rhythm that is cyclical and constantly advancing,&quot; Li Wan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 11:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[被上司“甩锅”怎么办？当首先秉直做好自己的分内事]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258030]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-06 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Complaining about your boss in the workplace is a long-lasting and endless &quot;program&quot;. Regarding the question &quot;What is the most shameless sentence you have ever heard from a manager?&quot;, some netizens&#39; answers resonated: A subordinate proposed a plan, and the leader said it was no good and must be modified according to his wishes. The subordinate insisted, and the leader was angry, &quot;Listen to me. That’s fine.” There was a problem with the implementation of the leader&#39;s revised plan. The leader went to his subordinates and said, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you insist on it in the first place? You should insist on what you think is right. You have to find a way to convince me. You have no opinion at all.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&quot;Why don&#39;t you persuade me properly?&quot; In essence, this sentence represents a kind of shirk of responsibility. Isn&#39;t there a saying, &quot;The merit is for oneself, the fault is for others&quot;, which refers to this kind of person. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of leader is indeed the kind that easily arouses public anger. It is clear that his subordinates have opinions but their opinions are &quot;beaten to death&quot;, and they still say that others have no opinions, which is simply a hooliganism. But it’s not too weird, because he at least hinted that the subordinate’s original plan was correct, and it is extremely difficult for a leader to admit this. Leaders who do things like this are really rare nowadays. Leaders who shirk responsibility will not do it so obviously and without skills, because it is impossible to sit in this position with such a simple and crude IQ. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A situation a little more &quot;shameless&quot; than this was mentioned by a netizen: Under normal circumstances, the leader will tell you that you have messed up such a good plan of mine, how to implement it? of? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This sentence really impressed me. Yes, some leaders have this tone and taste. They are &quot;always reasonable&quot; in front of their subordinates. But this is not the best of &quot;pass-and-pass leadership&quot;. The real best is that he never says what his plan is, he just asks you to implement it, and then keeps making changes. Such leaders are either unpredictable and disdainful of mediocre plans, or they are extremely poor and like to &quot;hide their clumsiness&quot; while using their subordinates as &quot;guinea pigs&quot; for plans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The latter situation is not uncommon in reality. To put it bluntly, some people get into important management positions without knowing how, and then start a happy life of being guided by laypeople. To be honest, I&#39;m most afraid of this. If a lay leader values ​​your talent and ability and therefore chooses to respect your plan, that&#39;s not bad. The worst thing is that he doesn&#39;t know how to pretend to understand and is stubborn and uses a lot of jokes to explain &quot; Management wisdom&quot; to force subordinates to &quot;obey&quot;. When I was young, I encountered bosses who would always say, &quot;You just need to be obedient.&quot; Ninety-nine percent of those who advocate &quot;obedience and learning&quot; are ambitious and talented bosses who love to pretend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relatively speaking, a leader who is &quot;overbearing&quot; but can handle things and take responsibility is much better. Those leaders who want to show leadership authority but have no structure are just &quot;dwarf&quot; leaders. The reason why they dare not take responsibility or take responsibility is because of selfishness and face. They do not have the courage to admit that they are inferior to their subordinates and are jealous of their talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is said that management is an art. There is nothing wrong with this, but one thing should be added: management must first be about human touch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What follows is what should subordinates do in the face of the aforementioned leaders who love to shirk their responsibilities? In other words, where is the boundary of responsibility between superiors and subordinates in the workplace? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In any unit, superiors and subordinates are the &quot;community of goals&quot;. Considering that most units adopt a project responsibility system, superiors and subordinates should be of one mind, be capable, and be wise. Out of wisdom, in short, judging by talent. But in reality, this kind of situation is rare. In many cases, the game and internal friction between superiors and subordinates fill the time and space of a unit, which is suffocating and sighing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, although the &quot;pass-through leader&quot; bears the greatest responsibility, is there no way for subordinates to reflect on it? it&#39;s not true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a unit, there are always the most &quot;honest people&quot;. They often just want to do things well and get paid on time. But if everything went so smoothly, there would be no such thing as &quot;workplace troubles.&quot; The biggest confusion a dutiful employee encounters is being blamed by his boss or even making things difficult for him. In this kind of environment, no matter what you do, it won&#39;t be satisfactory. Just looking at the leader&#39;s face every day is enough. In this regard, many people&#39;s bad emotions inevitably accumulate in their hearts, and there seems to be no other way except to find reliable people to complain about from time to time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But it’s useless to complain behind your back. If the leader can’t hear it, won’t it end up being scattered in the wind? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, as a subordinate, after encountering a strange leader, you are not just helpless and let others &quot;abuse&quot; you, but you can deal with it according to the actual situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a matter or a plan, if subordinates are not assigned responsibilities and bear the final consequences, it goes without saying that under normal circumstances, just listen to the leader. If you have a responsibility, it is your duty to do it well. If you do not do it well, you will bear the final consequences. Even if the leader puts forward opinions, they can only be used as a reference. If something is wrong, you will not blindly follow it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the &quot;ultimate person in charge&quot; of this matter is your boss, and you are just an executor, then when you encounter the leader making an obvious mistake, you can do it in two situations. The first is to persuade when necessary, state the interests and harms, and let the leader hear the correct point of view. As for whether the leader adopts it or not, the decision lies with the leader; the second is that if the leader is stubborn, he will not only be unable to listen to different opinions, but will even put forward opinions. If the behavior is not tolerated, then it would be uninteresting to stay in such a department. Instead of being blamed and taking the blame for a long time, it is better to consider changing departments - which is equivalent to changing the leader. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Persuading leaders is indeed risky. In the workplace, there are leaders who like to put small shoes on those who give opinions, but if you are a decent subordinate, why would you dare not to give opinions? Are you just worried about what your boss will think of you? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Years ago, when I was a middle-level cadre in a company, I often gave advice to my superiors, even arguing. Sometimes, my opinions are adopted, for example, to protect employees in my department from being punished indiscriminately; sometimes, my opinions are ignored, such as when the leader handles things unfairly in the elimination of the last place, resulting in people who should not leave. Being &quot;eliminated&quot; but refusing to correct his mistakes. This kind of nest had too much to worry about, and I felt uncomfortable. After careful consideration, I chose to leave. Although I lost some visible &quot;benefits&quot; as a result, I won the respect and understanding of those who knew me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the final analysis, if a subordinate wants to have a good relationship with his superiors in work and life, and coordinate various affairs well, it is the basic principle to be neither humble nor arrogant, and to stick to the bottom line. Without this principle, the relationship between the two parties will inevitably be distorted. A person with a strong sense of right and wrong cannot really change the adverse effects caused by insisting on the correct position, nor can he be as &quot;well-rounded&quot; as some people, but he should still insist on being an upright and outspoken person. Otherwise, even if we have achieved &quot;maximization of interests&quot;, we have lost our bottom line and character. Can we still have a clear conscience? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is the author&#39;s personal opinion only and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[尹学芸：故乡是一枚爱人丨月是故乡明⑥]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257348]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-06 10:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/ 09/04/73f60a5ff76ba4f9050678f79d1cf516.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1620&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/21/09/04/73f60a5ff76ba4f9050678f79d1cf516.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;159101&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Reading Yin Xueyun&#39;s &quot;The Hermit Seekers Are Not Encountered&quot; for the first time, readers may feel a little confused. His novels always &quot;talk right from the beginning, without any pretense&quot;, like green seedlings growing in the ground, simple and pretty, with a fresh earthy smell. A writer who is used to writing about villages, counties, officialdom, and wine shops, How did you come up with the idea of ​​writing an urban romance novel that looks like flowers in the fog? The 2021 novel collection of the same name includes several novellas such as &quot;The Hermit Seekers Are Not Encountered&quot;, &quot;Wanghu Tower&quot;, &quot;Feeding the Ghosts&quot;, &quot;The Apple Tree&quot; and &quot;Faster Than the Wind&quot;. Continue reading, this &quot;strange&quot; novel The origins of the story are gradually revealed, and a Yin Xueyun familiar to old readers slowly emerges. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The origin of Yin Xueyun’s writing is Jizhou in the northernmost part of Tianjin City&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>; (formerly known as Ji County before 2016) &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. There is an artificial lake in the small town, which was once an important water source for Tianjin. In the past, people often fished, took boats, and swam in the lake, but in order to protect the water source, these projects were canceled and many buildings around the lake were demolished one by one. She walked along the lake when she had nothing to do. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;The Hermit Seekers Are Not Encountered&quot; tells the story of two women, Xue Xiaoli and Su Mei, and a young man who went to an abandoned manor to search for her in &quot;pairs&quot; several times. The story of a reclusive master. The novel originated from an encounter with Yin Xueyun himself. During a stroll, she walked into an abandoned manor and saw different flowers and plants inside, as well as swings, a sports field, a fish pond, and a lake-view pavilion. The old luxury was clearly visible, and she even saw something familiar to her. man&#39;s inscription. There used to be many well-decorated sanatoriums in the small town. They were built by various departments in places close to mountains and rivers. It was difficult for ordinary people to enter, and they were later demolished. Such a manor could be hidden in the small Jizhou, and even the locals would find it difficult to find it. She guessed that this garden was also one of those sanatoriums. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/ec25f82eb0ee551da14bf69a97e2a8f0.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/ec25f82eb0ee551da14bf69a97e2a8f0.jpeg&quot; data-key= &quot;159102&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;There are only a few scenes in the small town. One scene can be looked back and forth, guessed, and used. This secret manor has been written by Yin Xueyun in &quot;Wanghu Tower&quot; and &quot;Looking for the Lake&quot;. Hidden people are not seen&quot;. When it is prosperous, the garden is the Wanghu Tower where retired workers from the county town spend all their money to treat guests to a meal; when it is desolate, the garden has become an elusive place for veteran cadres who are walking in official steps with their hands behind their backs. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It seems to be her writing instinct to repeatedly salvage, wash and chew her own life without wasting a grain of inspiration. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/8ded87050634cf1d3cb1a36b522a0991.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;171&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/8ded87050634cf1d3cb1a36b522a0991.png&quot; data-key= &quot;159097&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;From Hancun to Xuncheng&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;span >;Jizhou is the only semi-mountainous area in Tianjin. It is high in the north and low in the south. Mountains, plains, large depressions and reservoir areas gather here. The earliest history can be traced back to the Spring and Autumn Period. There is a poem in the Ming Dynasty that goes: &quot;When you come to the west to reach the end of the mountains, you will see the city of Jizhou.&quot; Life in the mountainous areas rarely changes, and people are not good at adapting. The characters in Yin Xueyun&#39;s works all have a persistent background. Color: Sisters Li Xun and Li Quan who persisted in love and pursued light in the war-torn years in &quot;The Wind and Dust&quot;, Feng Nuo who persisted in searching for her missing friend despite opposition in &quot;The Ballad of Cai Gen&quot;, and firmly believed in the power of the apple tree in &quot;The Apple Tree&quot; Suspicious Liu Ping... Some historians told Yin Xueyun that when the Qing army entered the Pass, the people of Ji County refused to surrender until death, and were massacred three times. The character of the people here was to be cruel, sluggish, and twisted. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Jizhou is a place where obsession arises, and Yin Xueyun’s literature is also the fruit of persistence. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Some people went to visit Yin Xueyun’s village after reading her works, but were disappointed to find that the river was not that clear, the streets were not that long, and there were not always cows braying when entering the village. and fried grasshoppers. Yin Xueyun has actually seen these beauties, but the rare village she writes about is neither a peach blossom garden nor a foreign land where strange legends are born, but a place of life, with all kinds of villagers passing through, providing three meals a day. Running around and calculating, the relationships between people are intricate and intricate. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;To be precise, the village where Yin Xueyun was born and raised is in the lowest depression in southern Jizhou, surrounded by water on three sides, with only one road on the south side. The &quot;Uncle Li Hai&quot; who won her the Lu Xun Literature Prize followed this road every year and came to &quot;my&quot; house empty-handed, bringing the family a glory that only existed in their imagination, and then loaded up with everything they had cobbled together. Food and supplies go back. The friendship that never returned lasted for more than 20 years and finally overdrawn. The family kept a secret about Uncle Li Hai. Only then did &quot;I&quot; know about the humiliating life history of my uncle. He did not live in an urban community with gardens and high-rise buildings, but in a remote place. In the barren Kuli Valley, the family is extremely poor, and several members of the family wait for Uncle Li Hai to bring flour from &quot;my&quot; house every year to make dumplings for the New Year. The two families looked up to each other and secretly compared each other to get through the difficult period. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;When Yin Xueyun was a child, the days in the village moved at an almost solid speed. The only changes were who died and who got married. Some people wear the same clothes in winter and summer, but they take out the cotton wool in summer and stuff it in in winter. The village is nicknamed &quot;Nagging Village&quot; because there are many people who are not doing their job properly and enjoy good food and drink. Meat that cannot be sold in other villages will be sold here. Her parents are both farmers, and there is no one around her who is involved in writing work. She looked for the source of her literary genes, which was her grandfather who could read scripts, sing operas, and shout trumpets. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many writers remember their reading history. She also wrote down in her notebook: &quot;Wild Fire and Spring Wind Fighting in the Ancient City&quot;, &quot;Fighting Youth&quot;, &quot;Golden Avenue&quot;...from elementary school She had memorized 147 titles of books she read from first grade to junior high school graduation. This number made her wonder if she had remembered it wrong. But in her words, these books are all about war, which may not be very nutritious for literature. When she was a teenager, she didn’t even know there were magazines in the world, let alone come into contact with foreign literature. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Even so, you must read, read one book at a time, and come out bit by bit. Because of scarcity, the memory of books is strong. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It is not easy for rural children to get access to books, and sometimes they have to &quot;match wits and courage&quot; with their brothers and sisters. When she was a child, her sister, who was seven years older than her, loved reading and would often bring books to the house but would not read them to her. Once my sister hid a book that was said to be &quot;not suitable for children&quot;. She turned the house upside down and finally found it in an old cotton shoe. When she took the book out, she only smelled the smell of feet. When she was not at home, she took it out and read it, stuffed it back after reading it, and secretly finished reading the book about &quot;sexual intercourse&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>; (later she found out it was &quot;Song of Youth&quot; 》)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/7f8bae790b16dddbf271186d99de917a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/7f8bae790b16dddbf271186d99de917a.jpeg&quot; data-key= &quot;159107&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;When she was not at school, she was reading a book while herding sheep. There was a lamb beside her and a copy of &quot;A Dream of Red Mansions&quot; without a book cover on her lap. The book was written in traditional Chinese characters. , she couldn’t understand it at all, but she could still remember the plot of “Second Sister You swallowed her own gold and died by herself”, and the stories in the book took root in her mind. On the way to school in the town, she walked in the wheat field with the children in the village. The children rushed to her side. She held a spindle in her hand and spun the cotton randomly pulled from the cotton field into thread, while talking about Mix books and memories with imagination to make a story, and tell it to your friends. She began to dream that one day her writing would be turned into type. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After graduating from high school, Yin Xueyun went to work as a seamstress in a village-run garment factory. As long as she had a day off, she would go to the county town and buy ten magazines and read them all night long. She also started to contribute articles to publications after work. At the beginning, she didn&#39;t pay attention to the differences between different publications. She couldn&#39;t remember the names of the writers she read, didn&#39;t understand anything, and her manuscripts were rejected many times. Sometimes, the editor criticized her in the rejection letter for imitating a certain writer. She was confused and didn&#39;t know who the writer she was &quot;imitating&quot; was. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At heart, she is still a farmer who relies on the weather. If it rains too much, the seedlings will grow wildly, and if there is a severe drought, there will be no harvest. The same is true for writing. There is no chance of winning awards or becoming famous. My ambition is to work step by step and write whatever comes to my mind. During this period, she relied on her innate spirituality and affection to write about life in the countryside and the ecology of the countryside, expressing those around her who were &quot;thinking of ways to live&quot;. She published publications ranging from &quot;Jixian Literature and Art&quot; to &quot;Tianjin Literature&quot; &quot;Tianjin Daily&quot;, the efforts are slowly paying off. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the late 1980s, Yin Xueyun’s novel &quot;A Woman Called Suyue&quot; was adapted into a TV series and broadcast on CCTV. The background music of this TV series was composed of a song called &quot; Yin Xueyun was deeply moved by the sound of Xun&#39;s musical instrument and decided to use &quot;Xun&quot; to name the cities in her future works. From then on, &quot;Xun City&quot; became another literary landmark of hers. At that time, she was helping the county write county chronicles. Due to the influence of CCTV, the county party committee specially gave her a quota, and she was directly transferred from a temporary worker to a national cadre. Speaking of this, Yin Xueyun couldn&#39;t help but sigh: &quot;Literature changes destiny, it is really literature that changes destiny.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/21/09/04/48d2bb4bfb153e940de848008ae8bbf9.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/48d2bb4bfb153e940de848008ae8bbf9.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;159106&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/21/09/04/8f8e08f82497d537eb26d7520546f685.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;171&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/8f8e08f82497d537eb26d7520546f685.png&quot; data-key=&quot;159099&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>; Emerging from deep waters&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;From a farmer to a cadre, Yin Xueyun worked in many different departments such as the Cultural Center, the Tourism Bureau, and the Housing and Urban-Rural Development Committee, and her work exposed her to She kept a distance from all kinds of people, observed how people think and act at work, and what kind of relationships needed to be coordinated, and wrote down each and every image of grassroots cadres. In the early years, someone from her workplace warned her not to write a novel about herself. She secretly asked, &quot;Which single character can constitute a novel?&quot; She likes to let the characters wash away in the long river of time, washing away their temporary moments. They are high-spirited and disgraced, leaving behind their usually faint but real humanity, and then weave a story frame for them. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;What is different from the countryside is that the government divides people into many levels. Leaders and non-leaders, older people and younger people, and even the background behind them will be deliberately divided. Measurement and speculation, in the workplace, people always have to face many different people and deal with many different relationships. In such a complicated and tame daily life, she expands the depth of people&#39;s soul introspection. &quot;Ten Years of Farewell&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(published in 2015)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; is a typical story about the transformation of human nature in agency work. This novel I started writing very early, and was left on the computer for ten years. During these ten years, Guo Yingzi, a young literary and artistic woman who &quot;always sees things with wishful thinking, cannot see any formalism, and cannot tolerate a grain of sand in her eyes&quot;, He learned to watch people&#39;s words and restrain his sharp edges, and became a well-rounded director in the office and an all-rounder at the bar. Chen Danguo, who was in a very similar situation to Yingzi at the time, could not bear the harassment from his boss and the isolation from his colleagues, so he committed suicide by jumping off the building. Chen Danguo&#39;s death made Yingzi realize that he had sunk into Accomplices also poses a thought-provoking question to readers: Does worldly success come at the cost of losing common sense and normal life? This novel resonated with many people and was recognized by the Hundred Flowers Literary Award. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Before the novel came out, Yin Xueyun also experienced a period of &quot;boiling a frog in warm water&quot; in literature. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;She has always been insensitive to fame and fortune. In her words, the author in the remote mountainous area is far away from the city and away from the vanity fair. Therefore, people are always in a state of submerging in deep water, and it is difficult to float even if they want to. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After the 1990s, Yin Xueyun gave the impression that her writing had stopped for several years. She was still young at that time, publishing novels and essays from time to time, and running a small magazine. She went around admiring flowers, playing cards, and picnicking with authors she knew, and had a lot of fun every day. But soon she felt tired. Although there are always works being published, there are only a few publications that I regularly contact, and the novels are bumping around in a small circle, without any upward momentum. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After walking out of the valley, as she grew older, she thought of things that she had never thought of before. &quot;You live in a place where the mountains are high and the emperor is far away. The advantage is that you are relatively free. The disadvantage is that you are relatively free and there is no one to supervise you. Later I met some writers in Hebei and I was particularly envious of them for having such a small group of three or five people who knew how to write. What&#39;s good and what&#39;s bad is. But at that time, no one saw it when I posted it in some places, and no one told you how to go.&quot; Yin Xueyun said. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Fortunately, the goodwill among grassroots writers &quot;caught&quot; her. When her novel was tepid, experienced writers gave her guidance - to publish it in an evening newspaper that was more life-oriented and had more readers. So she began to write novels for the Evening News, as well as prose and essays. The content became richer, including talking about football, reminiscing about the countryside, talking about family life, and everything in between. During that time, she went hiking every evening, thinking about writing while climbing. “Sometimes a series of topics are lined up at the back, and there is always a lot to write about. It is such a feeling that makes you feel that life is very interesting. &quot; Yin Xueyun described. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The newspaper column has a large volume of publications, and she has to publish several articles at a time. She thought of writing about the words that were slowly disappearing in the countryside where she lived. As urbanization continues to accelerate, some scenes of historical significance and local color in rural areas have become blurred. As rural people moved into the city, many dialect words that existed between the 1950s and the 1970s disappeared from people&#39;s communication, and a considerable part of them became history by the early 1980s. In order to prevent these words from disappearing quietly, she visited villages large and small in the county and dug out those words from the local population. Some words are spread over a wide area, some words are used differently in the south and the north, ancient and modern times, and some accents are difficult to imitate with words. When encountering difficult-to-grasp parts, she also discusses them with netizens from all over the world. This experience of searching on the field ridges left many memories such as &quot;opening the circle&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>; (the team had finished harvesting all the sweet potatoes, peanuts or wheat in the fields and allowed The members dig up the leftover sweet potatoes and peanuts or pick up the wheat ears left on the ground)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, &quot;Shinjuku&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>; (occasionally stay overnight in other people&#39;s homes)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, &quot;watch the green&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(watch the crops when they are about to mature and turn from green to yellow to prevent others from stealing them. Grain)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; and other hundreds of rural words were recorded, and later became a book &quot;The Slowly Disappearing Rural Words&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>; (published in 2009)&lt; /span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After writing essays and columns for several years, she gradually found her own writing style, and people in the entire city also knew about her. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/c460ca9c53226d3823b9f98c2f0cb4c8.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/c460ca9c53226d3823b9f98c2f0cb4c8.jpeg&quot; data-key= &quot;159100&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;2014 was a special year for Yin Xueyun. She published five novellas and wrote &quot;Uncle Li Hai&quot; and &quot;Ten Years of Farewell&quot; , entering the blowout period of the work. To this day, the fate of her and these works still makes her sad. At that time, a novella &quot;Linglong Tower&quot; was rejected. She could not figure out the reason for the rejection, so she gave the manuscript to Harvest magazine. Within a week, the editor called and suggested revisions. She did nothing during the months waiting for the final trial, and she doesn&#39;t know how she got here. She told herself that she would start writing after the final review, and she would stop writing after the final review failed. She was 50 years old that year, the age when female cadres leave their posts. If the manuscript had not been submitted to Harvest and had not been reviewed, she might have changed her life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The final review was passed. After &quot;Harvest&quot; published &quot;Linglong Tower&quot;, editors approached Yin Xueyun one after another to invite manuscripts. The first thing she wrote was &quot;Uncle Lehi,&quot; but it was shelved because of space issues. She brought another manuscript to the editor for comments, but was asked to publish it. This one was &quot;Ten Years After the Farewell&quot;. &quot;I always tell my writer friends, don&#39;t worry, write slowly. When you have the chance, the work will come when it comes. Sometimes you can&#39;t find it no matter how hard you look for it. This is not just a work. What kind of era.&quot; Yin Xueyun said. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the second year, Yin Xueyun continued to work hard and published 10 novellas, and by 2016, he had published 14 novels. She still finds the productivity of that period to be incredible. &quot;Although it was no longer the best time for creativity, you would feel that literature suddenly opened a window for you and you could seize such an opportunity. In fact, no one told you what to do at that time. But I really feel that way,” she said. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/ef2d03ef4a1659a5a7086bcd87ce3563.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;171&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/ef2d03ef4a1659a5a7086bcd87ce3563.png&quot; data-key= &quot;159104&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Thirty Years of Separation&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>; In recent years, Yin Xueyun’s vision has crossed from the countryside to the city, focusing on the involvement, entanglement and pain between urban and rural areas. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Thirty years after she left her hometown, she wrote a horrifyingly titled &quot;Feeding the Ghosts&quot;. The protagonist Yun Ya in the novel ordered her to hide from her hometown godmother before she died. There was a &quot;ghost feeding&quot; ceremony for him at the funeral, and he hurriedly made an appointment with netizen A Xiang to travel to Yunnan. Along the way, she kept receiving urgings and entreaties from her godmother&#39;s eldest son, which made her uneasy. When she returned to Xuncheng after the trip, she followed her godmother&#39;s last wish to feed ghosts, only to realize that feeding ghosts was just a simple Buddhist ritual&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(&quot;Feeding ghosts&quot; Also called &quot;flaming mouth&quot;, it actually means giving relief to ghosts and giving them food to keep them full.)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; More than three months later, Yunya received a call that her friend Axiang had died in a car accident three months ago. It was a futile exodus. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;When talking about the creation of this novel, Yin Xueyun said: &quot;Many times, hometown is like a lover. Sometimes it makes you think about how to escape, but more often , and it makes you think about ways to return. Only with contrast can there be contrast, and with contrast can there be expression of different emotions.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Although as a grassroots worker, Yin Xueyun still I need to interact with the countryside frequently, but it is no longer the state of living in it like when I was a child, but living as a guest. As she gets older, the distance from the countryside is also widening, and there is an increasingly annoying barrier between her and the people and things in her hometown. In the past, she liked to use familiar people repeatedly in multiple works, depicting different aspects of the characters, and filling the story with details, but now it is difficult to find such people in her life. In &quot;The Hermit Seekers Are Not Encountered&quot;, the dragon of modern people has its head but not its tail, and the weak and alienated feelings between people are expressed through a large amount of blank space. The spiritual connection that lasted more than twenty years in &quot;Uncle Lehi&quot; is no longer found. &quot;Then you discover that you are actually separated from all hometowns and villages. In fact, it is not them that change, but you. Many times it is your eyes that change, or your heart that changes. I go back less and less and interact with them less and less,&quot; Yin Xueyun said. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As a writer who specializes in rural themes, she has to be wary of this estrangement: &quot;The temperature in the works is actually receding, and the background color is fading. . I think this is a common problem among writers. Maybe every once in a while, you have to reflect on how to find a breakthrough in life. This is very important.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(Reference materials: &quot;Impression of Yin Xueyun&quot;, &quot;Yin Xueyun: No period of life is in vain&quot;, &quot;Yin Xueyun: I have been illuminated by this lamp&quot; Liang also looks forward to it illuminating more people.&quot; &quot;Exclusive Interview&quot; Yin Xueyun: The lowest author is far away from the literary world.
