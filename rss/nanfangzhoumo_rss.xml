On the afternoon of September 25, 2023, at the Qiantang Roller Skating Center, after performing a series of wonderful skateboarding moves, the 15-year-old Guangdong teenager Chen Ye won the championship in the Hangzhou Asian Games Men&#39;s Skateboard Bowl Final. This is the first gold medal won by the Chinese team in the skateboarding world competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Ye is a high-profile rising star in skateboarding. He was born in 2008 and has been making a mark in national competitions since he was 12 years old. In the 2020 National Skateboarding Championships and the men&#39;s bowl pool event of the 2021 National Games, Chen Ye won second place; in the selection of the 2022 Hangzhou Asian Games Skateboarding National Training Team, Chen Ye was selected with first place . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the preliminaries on September 24, Chen Ye&#39;s competition state was to seek breakthroughs in stability, and advanced to the finals with fourth place in the preliminaries. After the game, Chen Ye said that he would give it all in the finals and do the most difficult moves, &quot;try to get into the top four, or even the top three.&quot; Facing a field filled with experts, Chen Ye competed with a learning mentality. Didn&#39;t put too much pressure on myself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/JUNbfTebCRVb3G62S8AhCzeh1tcePOy7GmsOmyev.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/JUNbfTebCRVb3G62S8AhCzeh1tcePOy7GmsOmyev.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252192&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 25, 2023, Chen Ye in the finals&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the finals, Chen Ye continued to perform at a high level, breaking through the preliminaries in the first round, scoring 82.82 points, ranking first; in the second round, he set a new high score again, scoring 84.41 points, maintaining his advantage; In the last round, Chen Ye scored 80.62 points. Although it was not as good as the 84.00 points of Japanese player Yuro Nagahara in this round, he won the gold medal with the highest score of 84.41 points in the three rounds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the media interviews and press conferences after the game, Chen Ye repeatedly thanked one person, his father Chen Wanqin. On the road to the championship, his father always supported him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/rMtC7bLDYbb9LaCpTUv2iNfzZVqJ5DW4qOVv7X3W.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/rMtC7bLDYbb9LaCpTUv2iNfzZVqJ5DW4qOVv7X3W.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252197&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chen Ye (right) and his father Chen Wanqin&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Father and son&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Learning that he won the championship After the news, Chen Ye excitedly put on the national flag, slid around the bowl with a bright smile, and waved to the audience. &quot;I didn&#39;t really think about anything at the time. I was just very happy and very excited.&quot; At the post-match press conference, Chen Ye sat upright in front of the stage and answered reporters&#39; questions unhurriedly with a slightly hoarse voice during the voice change period, acting like a Shy boy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Ye emphatically thanked his father, &quot;He built two venues for me, thank him.&quot; Chen Ye only entered the national training team two months ago. Before that, he was his father. Chen Wanqin was guiding him. Skateboarding was only introduced to China at the end of the 20th century, and it was also relatively late to be listed as an Olympic sport. In 2016, the International Olympic Organizing Committee announced that skateboarding would be officially included in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Therefore, when Chen Ye first came into contact with skateboarding, there were almost no professional players and professional coaches in the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Ye fell in love with skateboarding by chance. On New Year&#39;s Day in 2016, Chen Wanqin took Chen Ye to the sports mall. Chen Ye tried out the skateboard and liked it very much. Chen Wanqin said, &quot;I will take you to play when you want to play.&quot; A month later, Chen Ye He went to play every day, and Chen Wanqin bought him a skateboard. When Chen Ye persisted in playing for half a year, Chen Wanqin made up his mind to make skateboarding Chen Ye&#39;s longer-term hobby. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with street skateboarding, Chen Ye prefers skating in bowls and pools. “It can fly higher and go faster.” When he first started practicing, Chen Wanqin took Chen Ye on the Internet Find videos of skaters on the internet and practice whatever moves you’re interested in. Chen Wanqin&#39;s experience in learning dance allowed him to break down complex movements one by one and arrange Chen Ye&#39;s training in an orderly manner. They practiced at a public skatepark in Zhongshan City. At that time, there were very few people skateboarding. Most of the time, only the father and son were practicing. In order to communicate with more skateboarders, they would go to Hong Kong and Tokyo during holidays. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2016, the International Olympic Committee voted to include skateboarding as an official event in the Tokyo Olympics. The mentality of father and son has quietly changed, from &quot;becoming a skateboard master&quot; to a more professional direction. It was also at this time that national skateboarding competitions began in China, and skateboarding was also included in the 2017 National Games. The first competition Chen Ye participated in was the 2018 &quot;U Series China Youth Skateboarding Tour&quot; and he won third place. They found that &quot;it turns out that if you practice like this, your skills are pretty good.&quot; Does that mean that as long as you work harder, you can achieve better results? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no professional bowl pool in Zhongshan City. The nearest bowl pool is in Guangzhou, which takes two hours from Zhongshan. In 2019, in order for Chen Ye to have a professional training venue near his home, Chen Wanqin made a bold decision to build his own bowl pool. Later in his self-report, Chen Wanqin said that he was afraid of failure before building the project. &quot;I was afraid that I would invest all the money and not be able to make it.&quot; He simulated it with 3D printing and then felt confident. &quot;At that time, I thought, just be I work for my dreams. If I fail, I will fail. Anyway, I don’t have much money saved.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Wanqin rented a warehouse of more than 200 square meters and about 4 meters high, and learned to saw wood. Start by building the structure of the bowl piece by piece. Half a year later, Wanchi was actually made. And Chen Ye lived up to his father&#39;s efforts, honing his movements and techniques to become increasingly sophisticated, and achieving a major breakthrough in Chinese skateboarding at the Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2023, Chen Wanqin built a larger and more comprehensive skatepark. While accompanying Chen Ye in training, he accumulated experience and became a professional skateboard coach to guide more skateboarders. Kids enjoy skateboarding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And Chen Ye will continue to challenge a broader arena. After winning the Asian Games, Chen Ye admitted that he had no hope of participating in the Paris Olympics because &quot;the current speed and height are still not enough&quot;, but he will try to &quot;fly higher and accelerate faster&quot; during training and go to more places. The venue is slippery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/cYC3ATrbphgccA0H997dau8HWkQcpgJ1fdk6TcEo.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1205&quot; height= &quot;855&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/cYC3ATrbphgccA0H997dau8HWkQcpgJ1fdk6TcEo.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252193&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chen Ye is studying&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Conversation with Chen Ye&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/p>; strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You said at the press conference, &quot;When training, you should try to fly higher, accelerate faster, and overcome psychological obstacles. .&quot; So do you still feel scared when you skate? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Ye: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, if the speed (skating) is fast or very high, it is actually quite scary. When accelerating air (flying into the air), the faster the flying speed, the easier it is to shake and it is difficult to control. Should you jump in or out? It is also possible to jump very far and fall on the flat ground, which is a bit scary. It is necessary to accurately control the take-off position and landing position. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Then how do you overcome your fear? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Ye: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;If you are afraid, start with the short one first and increase the height little by little. There is no need to exaggerate all at once. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When you flew up, it was because you had no control Good wrestling? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Ye: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, especially when I am in a hurry, I think I will fly higher immediately. If I cannot control it well at this time, it is possible It dropped so low that it hit my knees and feet. Wrestling is very common. When you first start practicing each action, you must &quot;practice&quot; wrestling first. This will be safer, otherwise you may be seriously injured if you fall. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You initially followed the video training on the Internet , but complex movements still require on-site observation and learning. What movements did you go to Tokyo to learn? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Ye: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;At first, my father and I watched some simple teaching videos, broke down slow motion, and tried to practice. I went to Tokyo to learn air, because at that time there were no professional bowl pools in China, and U-shaped pools were hard to come by. There was a 4-meter U-shaped pool in Tokyo, and there were many skateboarders, and you could watch their demonstrations. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/GHb00IUOhv75Pq0ynXy0pNvlyZJ9mQdU2j8gGtwx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 980&quot; height=&quot;1709&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/GHb00IUOhv75Pq0ynXy0pNvlyZJ9mQdU2j8gGtwx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252194&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chen Ye in daily training&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics , Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How long did it take you to practice to learn air? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Ye: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In the beginning, you grab the board to jump, and then you click on the board to jump. The most standard thing is to grab the board when you hit the pole. About half a year. There will definitely be boredom. It was okay when I was in Tokyo, there were more skaters practicing together, but there aren’t that many skaters back home. When the moves get boring, just change to another move. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You started skateboarding in 2016. When did you decide? Become a professional skateboarder? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Ye: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It should be before the National Games. In 2019, in order to prepare for the National Games, my father built a bowl pond for me. The two of us decided to build it together. Because I participated in several competitions at that time and watched the performance of foreign players, I felt that if you want better results, you still need to have a professional venue. After building a professional venue, I felt that I should practice skateboarding seriously and professionally. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Your father said before that he took it out All your savings were used to build the bowl pool. Did you make a lot of determination at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Ye: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;No. Anyway, my father still wanted to support me and saw that I had achieved some results, but he did not say that he had particularly high hopes. He mainly wanted me to continue to stick to this hobby and interest. He wouldn&#39;t put too much pressure on me, just let me perform well during the competition, and he didn&#39;t say I must win any awards. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I asked about the training team training and father&#39;s training in the afternoon When talking about the difference, you said the styles are different.

I practice all the basic movements first, and then I can try more new movements. The training is to prepare for the Asian Games and show off my moves. My father knows me better than my coach. He has trained with me since I was a child, and he understands my psychology, movements, and problems better.

The scene is crowded with pregnant women and expectant mothers. Obstetricians say: In order to allow their children to go to school a year earlier, many expectant mothers who have not yet reached their due date have given birth to &quot;school babies&quot; through caesarean section, which has become a common phenomenon in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some parents say: You will know when you have children! One day late, one year delayed! Some pregnant women have just completed 37 weeks of pregnancy (the standard pregnancy period is 40 weeks, 38-42 weeks is considered normal) and the baby is removed through a laparotomy. Manual intervention can advance the baby&#39;s birthday to before September 1, so that the baby can go to school at the age of 6. Parents hope that their children will be one step ahead of other children at the &quot;starting line of life&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the fact is: there is no evidence that premature infants can win at the &quot;starting line of life&quot;. Premature infants have not been seen to have an advantage in any human group, at any historical stage, or in any field. Not only that, but premature babies have a greater chance of being born with physical and mental deficiencies. Not only do they lose at the &quot;starting line of life&quot;, but they are also likely to fall behind step by step in life, lose for the rest of their lives, and even suffer from lifelong illness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology&quot; pointed out: Newborns between 39 and 41 weeks are considered full-term babies. In the absence of external factors, full-term babies have the greatest probability of being healthier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Doctors generally advocate that caesarean section is not recommended unless it is difficult to deliver, and caesarean section is even more undesirable if the baby is less than three months old. Because any caesarean section carries risks for both the mother and the baby. There is a high probability that the child&#39;s lungs will not develop maturely, and premature babies are prone to accidents and stunted growth. For parturient women, performing a caesarean section before uterine contractions may result in incomplete uterine reduction and increase the risk of postpartum hemorrhage and infection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cesarean section when the baby is less than a month old or without signs of labor will also have varying degrees of psychological impact on the newborn. Child psychology research has found that children born by caesarean section have a significantly higher incidence of ADHD (ADHD) than children born naturally. They will develop symptoms of attention deficit, impulsivity, and hyperactivity later in life, which will affect learning and understanding for a long time (even lifelong). ability, while the situation of premature infants is even worse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Child psychologist Jean Piaget proposed the theory of &quot;stages of child development&quot;: at different ages, children&#39;s intellectual development grows gradually, and the order of each stage cannot be exceeded. Disruption, otherwise it will disrupt the normal development process of children&#39;s minds and even affect their adult personality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The old saying &quot;Children look the same every year&quot; is a simple summary of this objective natural law. Children aged 5, 6 and 7 are at different stages of psychological and intellectual development. Forcibly turning a child into a &quot;twisted melon&quot;, or even cutting it out of the mother&#39;s belly in advance, is &quot;stealing the seedlings&quot;, forcing the child to skip the normal development stage of life, forcing it to make a &quot;big leap forward in life&quot;, which not only affects the child&#39;s physical development It is unfavorable and will cause children under school age to be unable to keep up with their studies, resulting in low self-esteem and a dislike of learning. The outcome will most likely be counterproductive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The famous psychologist Gsell proved the &quot;maturity advantage theory&quot; through experimental data: through testing more than one hundred pairs of twins for many years, he found that regardless of race, gender, and regional differences, children with more mature development After training in a shorter period of time, you can get better learning results. It proves that a person&#39;s individual physical and mental maturity develops in an orderly and regular manner. Only when the individual matures, the learning effect will be better. Wait patiently, and when the time comes, the result will often be twice the result with half the effort in life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a private group discussing &quot;school-starting babies&quot;, some netizens said: I went to kindergarten or school when I was a little young, and I was not welcomed by the teacher because I couldn&#39;t keep up with the progress, and I felt quite hurt inside; Some netizens said: I have regretted for half my life that I had a caesarean section in order to catch up with school in September. Little did I know that my child has resumed high school. After all the effort, I have given back all the stolen years. I, my husband, and my child are exhausted and scarred both physically and mentally. Tired...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some educationists have proposed that not only should children be born by caesarean section so that they can go to school early, but even full-term children born normally should not learn too early, but should ensure that children have enough education in childhood and adolescence. Play time. Play is not &quot;abstaining from one&#39;s duties&quot;, but an important way and stage for the normal and complete development of various brain areas in human childhood, the formation of imagination and creativity, the cultivation of curiosity and exploration spirit, and the shaping of personality and character. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Forcing children to read, read, and recite ancient poems too early will not only enhance the memory areas of the brain, but also suppress the excitement and development of imagination, creativity, exploration, adventurous spirit and other areas. As a result, I had a caesarean section and worked hard for my children in early childhood education. The result of the struggle in the first half of my life was to be a clerk, being assessed on KPIs with trepidation, and calculating how much more would be deducted from my already limited salary each month. And those &quot;bad boys&quot; who are more comprehensive in mind, stronger in character, and more daring to think, venture and do become bosses and leaders... Assess your children&#39;s KPIs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In foreign countries, the standards for children&#39;s admission are relatively flexible. Many countries specifically select children for admission based on their actual development. In France, New Zealand, Australia and other countries, if a child prodigy who develops early and quickly is found, the school entry age can even be advanced to 5 years old. The regulations in the United States are 5-7 years old, and prodigies can enter school at the age of 5. It is usually very difficult for children to enter school again at 7 years old. Normal; South Korea stipulates that children can enter school at the age of 6, but the average child is still 7 years old. If the child grows and develops later, the school age can be pushed back further. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In our country, as early as 2017, the Ministry of Education had relaxed its policies at the policy level: it no longer imposed a &quot;one size fits all&quot; mandatory age limit for enrollment before September 1. In Hubei, Henan, Anhui and other places, the enrollment age has also begun to be &quot;relaxed&quot;, and &quot;flexible enrollment&quot; has gradually been realized, and the reforms have gradually become more reasonable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As policies become more reasonable, people’s psychology must also keep up.

Among them, the most eye-catching is the Chinese market - lululemon&#39;s revenue in the Chinese market in the second quarter was US$277 million (approximately 2 billion), a year-on-year increase of 61%. So far, China&#39;s market revenue in the first half of this year has reached US$527 million (approximately 3.87 billion), a year-on-year increase of 69%, making it the fastest growing region in the world. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;lululemon focuses on the mid-to-high-end market. A pair of yoga pants costs thousands of dollars and is rarely discounted. It is known as the &quot;Hermès&quot; of the yoga industry, although there are also many voices complaining on social media. lululemon charges IQ tax, and lululemon&#39;s performance in China is still booming - why is lululemon so popular? What are the hidden worries behind high growth? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Sales are booming&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;lululemon is a very young brand, launched in Canada in 1998 Vancouver is established. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Founder Chip Wilson saw many people practicing yoga in yoga classes who did not have appropriate yoga clothing. Many people came to class wearing cotton clothes or dance clothes. Clothes made of this kind of material are not suitable for hot and sweaty sports scenes. Chip Wilson seized this market demand and continuously improved the functionality of yoga clothing on the market, quickly gaining reputation and influence in the local area. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 2000, lululemon opened its first store in Vancouver. In 2005, lululemon received capital investment and expanded rapidly. In 2007, lululemon was listed on the NASDAQ in New York and the Toronto Stock Exchange at the same time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Lululemon’s sales have grown rapidly over the years. From 2004 to 2018, revenue increased from US$41 million to US$3.3 billion. In 2020, the number was US$4.4 billion, and in fiscal year 2022, US$6.257 billion was sold. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Seventeen years ago, net profit was only more than 1 million US dollars, and it has approached 1 billion US dollars in fiscal year 2022. In July 2022, lululemon&#39;s market value reached US$37.4 billion, surpassing Adidas and becoming the world&#39;s second largest sports brand after Nike. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;With the development and growth of lululemon, the Chinese market has become an existence that cannot be underestimated. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Lululemon officially entered the Chinese market in 2013, and the growth rate in the Chinese market is the most eye-catching. Lululemon&#39;s second quarter financial report this year shows that in the last quarter, the revenue in the Chinese market showed astonishing rapid growth: sales increased by 79% year-on-year, and the three-year compound growth rate of the mainland Chinese market exceeded 50%. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As of the end of the second quarter, lululemon has 672 directly operated stores around the world, 126 of which are located in the Chinese market. According to lululemon&#39;s global development plan, by 2026, the brand&#39;s revenue will double from 2021 to US$12.5 billion, the number of stores in mainland China will reach 220, and the Chinese market will become the brand&#39;s second largest market in the world. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/dc3185eb107611c6a0b78fe41a77ba8b.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/dc3185eb107611c6a0b78fe41a77ba8b.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252096 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo&amp;nbsp;/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt; span>;Why are they so expensive yet so popular&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Why can a pair of yoga pants priced at thousands of dollars sell so fast? Why has the market value become the second largest among global sports brands in such a short period of time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;First, find the track. The success of lululemon is related to its keen grasp of yoga, a relatively niche market demand at the time, forming differentiated competition, avoiding head-on competition with giants such as Nike and Adidas, and successfully overtaking in corners. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Second, do it to the extreme. &lt;span>; Even though there have been a lot of complaints about lululemon yoga pants, we have to admit that it is far ahead in the yoga pants market. It is indeed because after long-term and continuous investment in research and development, lululemon&#39;s yoga pants have a higher &quot; technical content”. &lt;/span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;For example, its scientific fabric ratio of 86% nylon and 14% Lycra, Slivere scent anti-odor technology, and seamless crotch cutting make it better than other yoga pants. It has greater comfort, better perspiration performance, and better fit. It is also slimmer and better able to reflect women&#39;s body curves. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This also makes lululemon’s wearing scenarios not limited to yoga venues. Many women also wear lululemon in their daily lives, expanding the use scenarios of yoga pants, and invisibly also Increased lululemon&#39;s sales. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Third, target middle-class women. From the beginning, lululemon’s pricing has been relatively high. Its user portrait is “a woman between 24 and 36 years old, with an annual income of more than $80,000, a high level of education, owns her own house, and has one and a half hours of work every day.” Take time to exercise and have a positive attitude towards life.&quot; Lululemon calls them &quot;super girls&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At that time, it coincided with the rise of middle-class women in North America. They needed more ways to prove themselves. lululemon’s positioning perfectly matched the needs of this group of women, and lululemon became the “super girl” &quot; logo. Later, lululemon&#39;s expansion in the international market copied this path. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Fourth, community operation. Lululemon hardly advertises and does not hire big-name celebrities as spokespersons. On the contrary, in various offline lululemon stores, ordinary yoga enthusiasts, athletes, and entrepreneurs become store ambassadors, and they serve as opinions in the local yoga community. Leaders, their trust and choice in lululemon also affects other community members. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At the same time, lululemon will hold a variety of community activities from time to time in its offline stores to enhance the connection between people, enhance consumers&#39; recognition of the brand, and They become the &quot;tap water&quot; of the brand. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Fifth, which is also the ultimate goal of the above four items, is to ensure lululemon’s brand style, increase brand premium, and make lululemon a symbol of identity, taste and lifestyle, allowing consumers to People are willing to spend a higher price to buy a pair of yoga pants. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;For example, a pair of lululemon yoga pants can easily cost thousands of dollars. While the outside world is complaining and confused, they also think that those who are willing to spend thousands of dollars to buy a pair of yoga pants should be People who have more financial resources, are more pursuing the quality of life, and are more particular about yoga exercises, right? The brand premium of all luxury goods comes from the imagination of this identity, and the same is true for lululemon. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Hidden worries still exist&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Lululemon, whose performance has been soaring and is now going smoothly, is not without hidden worries. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On platforms such as Xiaohongshu, there have been a lot of complaints about the poor quality of lululemon, such as deformation, pilling, non-sweat absorption, off-line... Netizens have pictures When the truth was revealed, I really thought this was a product purchased from Pinxixi for more than ten yuan, but the receipt posted by netizens proved that it was indeed an authentic product purchased from the store. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It costs hundreds to thousands of yuan, but the quality is so bad? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;lululemon&#39;s products come from OEMs, which also means that the requirements for quality control are very high. In the context of rapid development, problems such as cutting corners and cutting corners will arise, which will affect the quality of products. The brand image has a very big impact. In recent years, lululemon’s quality issues have been reported to officials several times. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In January 2018, lululemon’s women’s knitted sportswear was fined 51,000 yuan by the Shanghai Huangpu District Market Supervision and Administration Bureau for “substandard products passing off as qualified products”; In August 2019, lululemon was once again fined 81,900 yuan by the Shanghai Jing&#39;an District Market Supervision Bureau for &quot;passing off unqualified products as qualified products&quot;; in May 2022, lululemon violated Article 50 of the Product Quality Law (adulteration in products) Miscellaneous, adulterated, fake as genuine, substandard as good, or substandard products as qualified products), and was fined RMB 81,420 by the Beijing Xicheng District Market Supervision and Administration Bureau. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Although lululemon&#39;s yoga pants have good technical content, the core competitiveness in the apparel field is not out of reach. For example, the fabric texture of other yoga brands today is extremely close to that of lululemon. In addition to the brand premium, the wearing experience is not as obvious as the price difference. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On the one hand, lululemon’s quality has problems from time to time, and on the other hand, lululemon’s pricing is too high and the price-performance ratio is not high. Therefore, lululemon’s “replacement” products have emerged in large numbers. MAIA ACTIVE, Rampage Lolita, Particle Fever, Keep, Decathlon and other brands of yoga pants have gained many fans. In this context, whether lululemon&#39;s brand premium can always be maintained, we can only maintain a wait-and-see attitude. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;From major foreign luxury brands to lululemon, the ultra-high premiums of these brands have repeatedly explained: for a brand, quality is important, cost-effectiveness is important, and brand building Also crucial. If lululemon can maintain its brand position of &quot;seeing all the mountains at a glance&quot;, there will still be consumers paying for it-not just yoga pants, but also the brand logo. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Of course, lululemon must also ensure that it &quot;does not seek death.&quot; If quality problems are an exception, consumers may still be able to tolerate them. Once quality problems become the norm, technological content cannot maintain its leading edge, complaints become mainstream, and the brand will easily fall from its high position. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Although the pursuers have no way to achieve the brand effect of lululemon for the time being, if they can catch up and surpass them in terms of quality, technological content, cost-effectiveness, etc., it is possible to have the last laugh. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[免签、“白菜价”能否翻热泰国游？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257673]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 13:01:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;At 10:15 am on September 25, 2023, Thai AirAsia flight XJ761 from Shanghai landed in Bangkok Vannapur Airport, this is the first day that Thailand implements a temporary visa-free policy for Chinese tourists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to welcome the first batch of Chinese tourists arriving in Thailand after the visa-free policy, Thai Prime Minister Settar Thavis personally led many ministers to pick them up at the airport. The crowded crowds, smiling officials, and staff holding flowers... all reflect Thai hospitality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to Suvarnabhumi Airport, the first welcome ceremonies are also held simultaneously at Don Mueang Airport, Chiang Mai Airport and Phuket Airport. Tourists will receive jasmine garlands and pants with elephant patterns. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not the first time that a similar grand airport pick-up has occurred in Thailand. In January 2023, Thai Deputy Prime Minister Anutin, Minister of Tourism and Sports Phipak, and Minister of Transport Sassaya and other officials also went to the airport in person to welcome the first batch of Chinese tourists to Thailand after the implementation of the &quot;Category B Control&quot; for new coronavirus infections. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thailand welcomes Chinese tourists with open arms, but it has not completely ignited the enthusiasm of Chinese people to travel to Thailand. After a short-term boom in February and March, affected by rumors such as &quot;Ka Yaozi&quot; and the successive release of crime-themed movies based on Southeast Asia, the newly revived &quot;Thailand fever&quot; fell to the freezing point again. In the first half of 2023, China has fallen out of Thailand’s largest source of tourists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Can Thailand’s visa exemption attract Chinese tourists to return? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Thailand is anxious&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When I saw Zhang Lixia, she had heavy dark circles under her eyes and looked haggard. She was obviously not as busy as she had been in the past few days. recover from. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Lixia is the person in charge of a travel agency store in Guangzhou. From September 15th to 17th, the 2023 Guangdong International Tourism Industry Expo opened in Guangzhou. For the next week, Zhang Lixia was extremely busy. As the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holiday approaches, more and more tourists visit Thailand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Because it coincides with Thailand’s visa exemption, in just the three days of the Tourism Expo, the number of people who came to us to sign up for a group trip to Thailand exceeded the entire first half of the year.” Zhang Lixia told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 13, the Thai Cabinet meeting decided to implement a five-month visa-free policy for Chinese tourists from September 25, 2023 to February 29, 2024, covering China during this period. National Day, Lunar New Year and other time points when Chinese people like to travel. Thai Prime Minister Sai Tha Thakta emphasized that the visa-free policy will also waive visa fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, after being elected as the Prime Minister of Thailand, Saitha continued to regard attracting Chinese tourists as an important means to stimulate economic recovery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the third day after taking over as prime minister, Saita publicly announced that he would implement a visa-free policy for Chinese and Indian citizens. According to Thai Prime Minister&#39;s Office spokesman Chai Wachalom, Saitha will visit China in October, and promoting tourism cooperation between China and Thailand will become one of the main topics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The background of this series of measures is that the situation of Chinese tourists traveling to Thailand in the first half of 2023 is unsatisfactory. The Thai government hopes to attract more Chinese tourists to return through more effective measures. The &quot;Bangkok Post&quot; article pointed out that the Thai authorities aim to quickly stimulate the recovery of the tourism industry by relaxing entry policies and inject a shot in the arm for economic recovery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the epidemic, China was once Thailand’s largest source of overseas tourists. Therefore, since China resumes outbound tourism in 2023, the Thai government has high hopes for the return of Chinese tourists and set a goal of attracting 5 million Chinese tourists at the beginning of the year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, according to official data from Thailand, as of September 10, the number of Chinese tourists traveling to Thailand was only 2.28 million, ranking second on the list of inbound tourists, less than Thailand’s neighboring country Malaysia. In 2019, the number of Chinese tourists to Thailand reached 10.98 million, accounting for 27.6% of all inbound tourists in Thailand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, Thailand has also fallen from the top spot of China’s outbound destinations. Judging from the transaction volume of popular outbound destinations in the first half of 2023 given by Alipay, Thailand ranks fourth. The top three are: Hong Kong, China, Macau, China and Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The number of Chinese tourists visiting Thailand was lower than expected, which not only caught Thai officials off guard, but also devastated many domestic travel agencies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2023, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism announced the first batch of 20 countries to &quot;restore outbound group travel&quot;, and Thailand was among the list. Affected by the epidemic, outbound tourism has been at a standstill for nearly three years. After the news was released, many tourism companies began to plan outbound travel, and Zhang Lixia was one of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reviewing Thailand’s outbound tourism business in the first half of the year, Zhang Lixia summarized it with “the repeated alternation of hope and despair.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I didn’t expect the direction of the wind to change so quickly. In February, tourism to Thailand had just picked up, but in March and April, we began to have trouble getting guests.” Regarding the decrease in the number of tourists traveling to Thailand , Zhang Lixia’s memory is still fresh, “Colleagues in the operation department kept posting advertisements to attract tourists sooner or later, but they couldn’t get any response no matter how much they shouted. In the end, the price dropped and there was no way to lower it, so I had to pay for it myself and bear the loss.”&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;&quot;Cut position&quot; is a professional term in the tourism industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Travel agencies purchase a certain number of airplane seats from airlines in advance for sale to tourists. Such seats cut in advance are non-refundable and non-cancellable. You can enjoy discounts on group tickets by cutting seats, but there are also risks. If tourist arrivals are lower than expected, travel agencies will face losses. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The “cabbage price”&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;can’t attract people yet&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In early August 2023, Gao Bin and a group of friends came to Bangkok and Pattaya travel. Departing from Zhengzhou to Thailand, including visa fees and customs clearance tips, the six-day and five-night trip only costs less than 3,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The reason why the tour fee is so cheap is mainly because the tour period is approaching and there are not enough people to sign up. The travel agency has adopted a low-price strategy, which is more than a thousand yuan cheaper than the normal tour fee.&quot; Gao Bin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Guangzhou, the price of the same pure play group is only a little more than 3,000. “When overseas travel was first opened at the beginning of the year, everyone thought that Thailand was becoming more popular. In addition, there were not so many flights, so the price of group tours in Thailand increased slightly. Now, although Thailand is visa-free, the overall demand has not increased significantly. When supply and demand are almost equal, we dare not raise the price.&quot; Zhang Lixia said, &quot;The price of traveling to Thailand is now even lower than three years ago.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the &quot;cabbage price&quot; still fails Fully impress Chinese tourists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The queue time for a visa on arrival in Thailand was once a &quot;weather vane&quot; for the number of tourists in Thailand. Gao Bin traveled to Thailand twice in 2018 and 2019. Compared with before, he obviously felt that there were many fewer Chinese traveling to Thailand and the customs clearance time was much faster. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“When I came to Thailand in the past, I had to wait at least one or two hours in line to apply for a visa on arrival. This year, I only waited in line for about 20 minutes. After leaving the airport, there were only a dozen or so people picking up the group. It is no longer the previous grand occasion where there were huge crowds of people holding Chinese placards waiting for tour groups.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thailand tourism has experienced a downturn, and travel agencies and hotels that directly interface with tourists have a deeper feeling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Wan is the manager of a travel agency in a first-tier city in central China. In the first half of 2023, the store only accepted more than 30 customers who traveled to Thailand. &quot;Although the price of traveling to Thailand is low enough, outbound travel Tourism has not recovered much.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This situation is not unique. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The province and region where Li Wan lives has just held a summer review meeting. Domestic tourism sales accounted for 80% of summer tourism revenue, while outbound tourism only accounted for 20%. &quot;Before the epidemic, the turnover was basically divided equally between domestic and overseas companies.&quot; Li Wan told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;July and August are the peak periods of the rainy season in Thailand, but with the rise of study tours, summer study tours in Thailand have become a popular alternative for Chinese parents. However, this year, overseas study tours have not become popular in Thailand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three years after the epidemic, Wang Ying has high hopes for this summer’s study tour program. She booked a hotel in advance and made connections with teachers from Chiang Mai University. But what Wang Ying didn&#39;t expect was that the summer study tour turned out to be a rare hit, with almost no one interested in it. In the end, she had no choice but to cancel it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“At our peak, we received 500 Chinese people in one summer vacation, but very few signed up this year. Many people are worried about safety issues, and the elderly at home are unwilling to let their children go to Thailand. There are also some Those who were determined to register suddenly canceled their orders due to the sudden cancellation of direct flights to their cities.&quot; Wang Ying, who has been running study tours in Thailand for many years, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Public opinion whirlpool&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;China’s tourism to Thailand has been in the cold, and safety has always been an unavoidable factor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2023, self-media bloggers broke the rumors on the Internet that &quot;Thailand specializes in Chinese kidneys&quot; and &quot;Male model restaurants specialize in abducting Chinese women.&quot; Related videos and articles flooded the Internet. Thailand, with its &quot;beautiful scenery and high cost-effectiveness&quot;, once became synonymous with &quot;Ka Yao Zi&quot;, so much so that many people &quot;dislike Thailand&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Outrageous rumors are rampant, and the Thai authorities have to frequently refute them in an attempt to reverse the huge destructive power of negative rumors on Thailand&#39;s tourism industry. However, the official refutation of the rumors did not eliminate people&#39;s doubts about Thailand&#39;s security issues, and Thailand&#39;s tourism, which had just improved, once again encountered a downturn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This year, tourism in Thailand has indeed been greatly affected by public opinion. Many people who come to sign up for group tours will ask whether Thailand is safe or not. We can only emphasize to them again and again the safety of group tours. &quot;Zheng Yun, a practitioner in the tourism industry in a certain first-tier city, told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;In order to dispel customers&#39; concerns, we had to forward a large number of Thai official rumor refuting articles in WeChat Moments and push them to tourists.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, , the &quot;Gayaozi&quot; controversy has not completely subsided, and new public opinion crises are coming one after another. Since June, two crime-themed movies based in Southeast Asia, &quot;The Vanishing Girl&quot; and &quot;All or Nothing&quot;, have once again brought Thailand to the forefront. Thailand, which is &quot;a waste of Chinese tourists&quot;, has been shaped by public opinion into the role of a &quot;transit station&quot; for telecom fraud in northern Myanmar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A friend of Gao Bin had applied for a passport, but his family did not allow him to go to Thailand because they were worried about safety issues. They even chased him from his hometown to the city to try to get him to give up the idea of ​​traveling to Thailand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar worries are actually not isolated cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To this day, in a Thailand tourism WeChat group, many netizens still raise doubts about whether it is safe to travel to Thailand from time to time. A tourist who bought a ticket to Thailand for the National Day said in the group, &quot;I don&#39;t dare to say I want to go to Thailand. I am afraid of being laughed at by others, and I am also worried that my family will not let me go.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;February and March When I visited, I clearly felt that the number of Chinese tourists on the streets was increasing, and there were three or four people traveling in Thailand just by checking the circle of friends.&quot; Wang Wan, who has been running a B&amp;B in Thailand for 6 years, told Southern Weekend reporters, but by the end of March, he could not see them at all. When people arrive, the whole street is empty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the analysis of the Tourism Authority of Thailand, the slow growth of Chinese tourists in Thailand can be attributed to four reasons-the relative weakness of the economy and currency, the Chinese government’s promotion of domestic tourism and local transportation upgrades, the insufficient supply of Thai tourism services and the lack of living standards. Rising costs and negative publicity about safety are hurting Thailand&#39;s image. Among them, concerns about safety are the most critical factor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The biggest obstacle facing Thailand’s tourism industry is eliminating negative perceptions about the safety of traveling to Thailand. Without action to reduce crime in Thailand and eliminate negative content on Chinese social media, any verbal or written commitments will be It will be meaningless,&quot; said Tourism Association of Thailand chairman Sisatheva. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Losing money and making money&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Thai government seems confident whether the visa-free policy can ignite the enthusiasm of Chinese tourists to travel to Thailand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 24, 2023, Thailand’s Minister of Transport Suriya Tsenglongliangjit told the Bangkok Post that driven by the visa-free policy, flights from China are expected to increase from 72 per day to 96, and the corresponding number of tourists will double, from 9,680 to 18,656 per day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Attracting 5 million Chinese tourists to Thailand is completely achievable.” Surya vowed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rapidly rising search popularity of Thailand on several domestic online travel service platforms seems to also confirm the return of &quot;Thailand fever&quot;. Half an hour after the visa exemption news was announced, Thailand-related searches on Ctrip’s platform soared 800% month-on-month. &quot;Qunar&quot; big data also shows that the search volume for Thai air tickets on the platform increased by more than 70% from the same time last week, and the search volume for Thai hotels doubled from the same time last week. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But to what extent this attention can be translated into actual travel numbers, practitioners are continuing to wait and see. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the visa-free policy was introduced, Wang Wan originally wanted to consider raising the price of her property, but the volume of orders made her give up the idea of ​​raising the price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, 98% of Wang Wan&#39;s self-operated B&amp;Bs were Chinese tourists, but now only 20 to 30% of the guests are from China every month. The peak tourist season in Thailand is from October to February of the following year. Tourists usually book rooms in advance. Half of the rooms in Wang Wan&#39;s B&amp;B have been booked, but few of them are from Chinese tourists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The three orders I received recently were from Australia, Malaysia and Singapore. After the visa exemption, I did not receive any orders from Chinese tourists at all.” Wang Wan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The short-lived popularity of Thailand tours before the National Day did not completely dispel Zhang Lixia&#39;s worries. She did not dare to take the risk of booking a flight in advance. The &quot;Thailand fever&quot; predicted in the first half of the year did not appear, and the large amount of compensation for charter flights in advance still left Zhang Lixia with lingering fears. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In March and April, the cost of a six-day, five-night trip to Thailand had dropped to a minimum of 1,999 yuan, while the flight cost was 2,000 yuan. The tour fee was no longer enough to cover the cost. This was purely a loss. I made a lot of money, but still no customers were willing to sign up for a group tour,&quot; Zhang Lixia recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“After the repeated torment of hope and disappointment in the first half of the year, our mentality has become a little calmer. Now we reserve seats for two or three flights a week. If the number of passengers increases, we will purchase additional seats. I will no longer rush to occupy 50% to 80% of the seats like before.&quot; Zhang Lixia sighed and said, &quot;I dare not now.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Yun also pointed out that he was indeed busy for a while before the National Day. &quot;Thailand tours from September 27 to October 2 were all booked, and the price increased by almost a thousand yuan compared to before. However, the popularity soon faded away, so we had to lower the price.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Yun is still &quot;hopeful&quot; about the recovery of Thailand&#39;s tourism in the next three months of 2023. But at the same time, she is not prepared to increase the number of charter flights and seats in advance. She is not sure how long the current enthusiasm of Chinese people to go to Thailand will last. &quot;If the number of subsequent group registrations increases, we will discuss with the airlines to obtain seats.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As Thailand’s tourism industry has experienced a downturn, airlines’ strong position is no longer what it used to be. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Air Travel Zongheng’s big data shows that in the first week of August, the number of flights to and from Thailand by domestic airlines exceeded 800, which was only about 52% of the same period in 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In 2019, everyone had to pay full price in advance to grab a seat, and whoever can get the seat can receive more guests. Now the situation has been completely reversed. As long as you have guests, the seat Any time.&quot; Zhang Lixia said frankly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Zhang Lixia, Li Wan, Wang Ying, Wang Wan, and Zheng Yun are pseudonyms in the article)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/ p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 13:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[困在考研考编里的年轻人，他们是在逃避什么吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257615]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In recent years, the number of postgraduate admissions nationwide has increased year by year. From 760,000 in 2018, it surged to 1.25 million last year, more than 60%. During the same period, the number of people taking the postgraduate entrance examination more than doubled from 2.38 million to 4.57 million. About 70% of those who fail the postgraduate entrance exam every year will face fiercer competition next year if they choose to retake the exam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other examination rooms, the situation is similar. The number of people recruiting civil servants and public servants across the country has increased significantly, and the number of applicants has also skyrocketed. No matter which examination room young people rush to after graduation, they will face fierce competition that is no less fierce than the college entrance examination. The accumulation of consecutive losers has become a rich source of stories for the media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, Sanlian Life Weekly’s article “Five Years Trapped in the Postgraduate Entrance Examination and Editorial Examination” interviewed a person who took the postgraduate entrance examination, the public examination and the editor examination continuously. According to the narrator, she felt that the major she studied at university had no future in work, and her family worshiped academic qualifications, so she took the postgraduate entrance examination every year, and also took the public and editing examinations at the same time, which lasted for five years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After failing the five-year exam, this girl had to enter the workplace under financial pressure. She realized that although her new job was hard, it was at least &quot;possible&quot; and that her classmates who &quot;went ashore&quot; were actually not doing much better. But by the end of the article, this girl still couldn&#39;t forget it and was still taking the exam in September this year. Just when the reader thinks there is a bright future and the spiritual internal friction is coming to an end, everything returns to the starting point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many full-time exam takers today spend a lot of time and energy just to gain some uncertain advantages in the future. In terms of postgraduate entrance examinations, although a master&#39;s degree has some advantages over a bachelor&#39;s degree in the workplace, the advantages are actually limited considering the age factor. Those who work hard for the &quot;iron rice bowl&quot; seem to be very good, but the career path of most positions is narrow, the income is not high, and it is difficult to change jobs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to postgraduate entrance examinations, public examinations and editing examinations, there is also a large group of &quot;teacher examinations&quot;. In 2022, more than 11 million people will take the teacher qualification examination. Many people take the test for everything, whether they like it or not. They continue to take exams all year round, but in order to find a decent and stable job, these jobs are basically within the system, with poor mobility and difficulty in changing jobs, but they are better than &quot;stability&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Spending a lot of time and energy on a huge gamble in life is deplorable in my opinion. At the age when life is the most energetic, you hide in a study in a small building and study hard to prepare for exams. You do not create value, do not learn knowledge and skills, and you cannot even enjoy happiness. Is it really worth it to have a stable job in the future? Moreover, most people are destined to fail and become the denominator rather than the numerator. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On social media and exam forums, this kind of day is &quot;inspirational&quot;. Many people stick together to keep each other warm, and even if others disagree, it seems difficult to criticize them: everyone has a different path, and the choice does not matter whether it is high or low, right? There are more and more people taking vocational exams, which is related to the employment environment and this atmosphere. Studying full-time for exams right after graduation has become a popular phenomenon among the new generation of young people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is this phenomenon really blameless, even inspiring? Hard to say. The premise of the &quot;professional examination family&quot; is: they don&#39;t make money, they rely on support. College students are generally over 20 years old after graduation and cannot support themselves but rely on their parents. This kind of &quot;parasitism and support&quot; is all voluntary, and some parents even ask their children to take exams, but from a sociological perspective, they are not adults. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Young people get better education, get rid of the shadow of their parents, start careers, and surpass their parents&#39; achievements. This is a common phenomenon in a healthy society. Relying on parents for support and being unable to &quot;wean off the baby&quot;, the opportunity to obtain large amounts of wealth is directed to inheritance, and the life style of nibbling on the elderly and parasitism is ridiculed as &quot;full-time children&quot;. This kind of spiritual epidemic is a kind of malaise and decadence, and it is not worth beautifying at all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the surface, full-time candidates are pursuing a stable job, but in reality they are escaping from market competition. They have gone from being temporarily supported by their parents to hoping to be supported by the system. Even if they are admitted, their income comes from taxes, and taxes rely on individuals and companies to create value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is also the reason why the country requires streamlining administration, delegating power and reducing personnel. It’s just that due to the huge pressure on the job market, civil servants and public servants are regarded as “employment reservoirs” by some places. In recent years, local governments have been cutting jobs while expanding recruitment. This approach cannot completely solve the employment problem, but will only continue to delay it for you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The young people who are &quot;trapped in the postgraduate entrance exams&quot; are not really trapped. They just hope to pass the exam and get rid of market competition and sit back and relax. I personally don’t like this kind of life choice; and when the public examination becomes a popular competition, more and more people are addicted to it. I believe it is not a good thing for individuals and society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people feel that it is a helpless choice for young people to take the postgraduate and editing exams repeatedly. This is true to a certain extent, but this choice is not worthy of encouragement, and it must be pointed out that for personal destiny, this tragic and painful journey is full of huge risks. Is it worth it to spend so much effort &quot;getting involved&quot; with your peers in order to escape market competition? Wouldn’t it be much more meaningful if this kind of motivation and effort were applied to work? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, on the other hand, the other path, which seems to be full of thorns, is actually more reliable. In the past two years, many young people have taken jobs that were previously held by people with low academic qualifications. They face it with a pragmatic spirit, put aside their highly educated self-esteem, support themselves first, and then develop. Compared with those who are addicted to exams, this choice is more worthy of respect and more likely to lead to a better life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 12:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[山西大同小学生遭多名同学辱骂、殴打、欺凌，官方通报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257671]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 12:38:39&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On September 26, the joint working group of Datong City, Shanxi Province issued a notice.

Since taking the first step into outer space, humans have begun to explore the impact of the space environment on various animals, plants and even microorganisms. Whether plants can grow in the space environment and whether they can provide fresh food for space travelers. Especially after the completion of the space station, astronauts have enough space and time to help scientists on earth answer these questions, and also add some fun and nutrition to the astronauts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1982, astronauts on the Soviet Salyut 7 space station used a miniature greenhouse device to conduct the first &quot;from seed to seed&quot; full life cycle cultivation experiment of Arabidopsis thaliana, proving that plants on earth can be Growth and seeding outside the earth have opened up human attempts to grow vegetables, flowers, and grains in space. In the following ten years, Soviet astronauts completed space cultivation experiments of various plants. However, these plants grown in space were not for human consumption, but were limited to scientific research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is American astronauts who actually grow vegetables to eat in space. In order to allow astronauts to eat fresh vegetables, fruits or other fresh foods, NASA has developed some plant cultivation devices, such as the vegetable production system Veggie and the advanced plant habitat APH. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The vegetable production system is a small plant growth device suitable for space stations that can automatically provide light, water, air and nutrients for vegetable growth. It is only the size of a suitcase and can generally grow 6 types of vegetables. . Since 2014, American astronauts have used vegetable production systems on the International Space Station to cultivate lettuce, Chinese cabbage, Chinese cabbage, kale, mustard, zinnias and other plants. Some of them are for scientific research, and some are used by astronauts. Eat it as a salad, I heard it tastes great. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The advanced plant habitat is a more complex, more automated, fully enclosed plant growth device equipped with cameras and more than 180 sensors that can monitor light, temperature, humidity, atmospheric content, etc. Sensing and controlling, and staying connected to the ground laboratory so that observations and research can be carried out simultaneously on the ground and the space station. Advanced plant habitat installations enable more complex, diverse, and long-term plant growth studies. So far, American astronauts have used this device to conduct full life cycle cultivation experiments of Arabidopsis thaliana, dwarf wheat, radish, pepper and other plants. The pepper planting test is the longest and most &quot;stimulating&quot; test among them. After more than three months of growth, the pepper seeds have gone through the entire process of germination, flowering, fruiting, and maturity. In November 2021, after the peppers matured, the astronauts stored part of them and left them for ground laboratories to conduct follow-up analysis and research, while the other parts were made into delicacies by them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/ZOmrdJMaHYfre5mMIu8NlOZMBXsOfVQDFKQj0KOM.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1032&quot; height= &quot;688&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/ZOmrdJMaHYfre5mMIu8NlOZMBXsOfVQDFKQj0KOM.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252165&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Astronauts pose with the peppers they grow on the International Space Station. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(NASA/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Rice bears seeds on the Chinese space station&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Shenzhou The first manned flight on the 5th, Yutu&#39;s visit to the moon, Zhurong&#39;s inspection of Mars, the &quot;reunion in space&quot; of the Chinese space station... The booming Chinese aerospace industry has also injected new vitality into the exploration of space farms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2019, a mysterious scientific device was transported to the far side of the moon by the Chinese lunar probe Chang&#39;e-4, where it was performing an important mission. This scientific device was developed by scientists from Chongqing University and contains four kinds of seeds, including cotton, rape, potato, and Arabidopsis, as well as two animal eggs, yeast and fruit fly. After landing on the far side of the moon, the seeds that were originally dormant began to wake up and enter growth and development mode. Within nine days, the seeds began to germinate, and the cotton seeds also sprouted buds. Although the germination of cotton seeds on the moon is just a flash in the pan, this is the first green leaf to grow on the moon. Perhaps in the near future, more plants will sprout, bloom and bear fruit on the moon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the newly built Chinese space station, Chinese astronauts started longer-term plant growth experiments. This time the test subjects were Arabidopsis thaliana and rice. As we all know, rice originated in China and is one of China&#39;s main food crops. No one has ever conducted a full life cycle cultivation experiment of rice in space before. During the four-month test, both Arabidopsis and rice successfully completed the entire life cycle of seed germination, seedling growth, flowering and seeding, proving that rice can grow on the space station. However, scientists have observed that many indicators of rice grown on the space station are significantly different from rice grown on the ground, such as earlier flowering period, longer grain filling time, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rice generally has the ability to regenerate. The rice stalks left behind after normal harvest can also grow rice ears, thus increasing rice yield. This experiment also observed the regeneration ability of rice on the space station. As a result, more than 20 days after the rice was harvested, a rice plant on the space station also regenerated and grew two rice ears, indicating that regenerating rice is feasible in a small closed environment. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our country has achieved world-leading scientific and technological achievements in the field of aerospace breeding. It is believed that with the in-depth development of aerospace projects such as the China Space Station, the Moon Landing Project and the Planetary Exploration Project, our country’s astronauts will be in a wider field. Grow vegetables, flowers, and crops in space to bring fresh, nutritious and delicious food to future space travelers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Km6QSDoE6uvnXPxyRos0LJ1iz8pZkqoCacoyIswX.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;806&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Km6QSDoE6uvnXPxyRos0LJ1iz8pZkqoCacoyIswX.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252164&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Rice seeds growing in the Chinese space station. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;How far is it from the real space farm&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;However, so far So far, these plant cultivation experiments conducted in the space station have been extremely small-scale. It is a huge challenge to actually build a space farm, and there are still many problems that need to be solved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether it is the moon or Mars, the harsh environment is not suitable for plant growth at all. Therefore, the first step in building a space farm is to build a large-scale intelligently controlled greenhouse facility, similar to the intelligent greenhouses built on the earth, so that Plants have &quot;houses&quot; to live in. First of all, this greenhouse facility is completely airtight, can maintain stable temperature, and can protect plants and humans from cosmic rays. Secondly, this greenhouse facility is suitable for remote control, which requires full monitoring of the growth process of plants and timely control of temperature and light. , atmosphere, moisture and nutrients are precisely controlled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second step is to allow the plants to &quot;eat and drink&quot; to maintain the operation of plant life and the operation of the entire greenhouse facility. The main power for greenhouse operation comes from solar power generation. This technology is not difficult, but it is a big problem to provide the necessary soil, nutrients, water, atmosphere, etc. for plant growth. Soil mainly provides support and nutrients for the growth of plant roots. Studies have shown that plants can grow in lunar soil or volcanic ash, but they will grow more slowly than in earth soil. In addition to soil, hydroponics can also be used. This smart greenhouse is relatively common on the earth. Of course, hydroponics requires a lot of water. The moon and Mars are both dry planets with little water and require artificial synthesis. This means that water must be accurately distributed to plants according to their needs. Plants also need carbon dioxide for photosynthesis, and nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are needed for plant growth. These need to be synthesized or extracted by making full use of raw materials on the planet where they are located. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the &quot;housing&quot; and &quot;food and drink&quot; problems are solved, the protagonist can be invited out. At this time, it is very important to choose what kind of plants to plant. Not all plants are suitable for space farms. First, these candidate plants must be able to adapt to the unfavorable conditions of space, such as microgravity, high radiation, large temperature differences, lack of water and fertilizer; secondly, candidate plants should be rich in vitamins, antioxidants and other nutrients to provide space for astronauts, space tourists or settlers. Supplement additional nutrients; in addition, candidate plants should have the characteristics of short growth cycle, small space occupation, and easy management. In addition to selecting existing plant varieties, in the future, scientists may tailor special plant varieties for space farms, such as potatoes that are more suitable for growing in Martian ash, tomatoes that grow better under microgravity conditions, etc. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, each plant to be grown on the space farm needs to be carefully selected and passed simulation tests in ground laboratories to accurately calculate the nutrients, moisture, atmosphere, light, etc. required for its growth. , in order to minimize the waste of resources in space. It is worth mentioning that NASA assigned this part of the work to middle school students. NASA has launched a &quot;Growing Beyond Earth&quot; public welfare program, inviting middle school students across the United States to participate in space plant growth research and select plants suitable for planting on the International Space Station. As of December 2022, more than 40,000 middle school students and their instructors have participated in this activity, and screening tests of more than 180 types of plants have been carried out, and pak choi grown on the vegetable production system is one of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China’s manned moon landing plan is being steadily implemented, and the U.S. government also plans to return to the moon. Musk even proposed to build a self-sufficient city on Mars around 2050, and it is possible for humans to settle outside the earth. The day seems to be getting closer, when the construction of space farms is an indispensable link, which requires future scientists around the world to continue to improve space farms, maybe you can also participate in it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[书籍背后，隐形的人：宁成春的六十年]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257645]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/25/xIbJ7A8GZuLEmVxoLbqkz1CUXdwzffSWAxpGpWcn.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1067&quot; height=&quot;1600&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/xIbJ7A8GZuLEmVxoLbqkz1CU XdwzffSWAxpGpWcn. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252129&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Ning Chengchun, a book designer who is over eighty years old, has spent nearly a decade in his design career , more than 1,500 books were born from his hands, which is almost equivalent to a history of contemporary Chinese publishing. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;81-year-old book binding designer Ning Chengchun is still living the life of an office worker . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he has work, Ning Chengchun takes the bus to and from his studio in Chaoyang, working from nine to five. In 2002, he retired from Sanlian Bookstore and established his own studio. Retirement just means changing places and continuing to design books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When drawing design drawings, Ning Chengchun&#39;s sitting posture was the same as when he was young: his back was straight, his shoulder blades were arched, and his head was slightly bent. He is still used to wearing shirts. The biggest change in his appearance is that he has grown a silvery white beard and trimmed it neatly after getting older. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are various books, a computer, and a pot of tea on his work table. Through the window on the left, sunlight pours in. The computer was for the assistant. Ning Chengchun used pens, rulers, and grid paper. The covers and layouts that were drawn by hand were handed to the assistant and turned into computer files. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are two book walls in the studio, and one of the bookshelves contains books he designed himself. In August 2023, he published the collection &quot;A Person&#39;s History of Book Design&quot;. In his nearly one year of design career, he has produced more than 1,500 books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These sixty years are equivalent to a history of contemporary Chinese publishing. In 1986, after Sanlian Bookstore resumed its independent establishment, Ning Chengchun became the first director of the art department. His works outline the historical changes of Sanlian Bookstore. The &quot;Reading and Writing Series&quot; closely related to the publisher Fan Yong established the ideological banner of the 1980s; &quot;Huai Ju Shi Cun&quot; and &quot;Bathing&quot; designed for Qian Zhongshu and Yang Jiang set a precedent for writing books for a large number of scholars. ; &quot;Collection of Jin Yong&#39;s Works&quot; has made countless fans of Jin Yong bow and remain unforgettable to this day; &quot;Chen Yinke&#39;s Last 20 Years&quot; inspired the &quot;Chen Yinke craze&quot; in the 1990s; the &quot;Local China&quot; series has led the creation of &quot;picture books&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of the editor of Sanlian Bookstore, Ning Chengchun is not old at all. When he has an important manuscript, he still asks him to contribute as he has done for decades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the balcony, a Monstera deliciosa grows as tall as a person. It was given to Ning Chengchun by his colleagues when he was hospitalized in 2008. Assistant Hu Changyue met Ning Chengchun in 2006. At that time, Ning Chengchun was working hard. At most, he hired 6 assistants to cooperate with the design. During his hospitalization, Ning Chengchun was still drawing layouts even in the hospital bed. The nurse reminded him to stop drawing and take a good rest. Within a week of his heart bypass surgery, he was back in the studio. &quot;If you can&#39;t do it in a day, you can do it for half a day.&quot; Hu Changyue recalled to a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the second year after the operation, Ning Chengchun decided to close his studio, but many people continued to approach him for design, but the number of orders was reduced, and the work did not really stop. In 2019, Ning Chengchun underwent another heart stent surgery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that the collection of works has been published and is selling well, he wants to &quot;retire&quot; as soon as possible, writing, painting, and reading books that he had no time to read before. But when someone asked him to design some books, he still couldn&#39;t bear to refuse. The National Library wanted to publish &quot;The Complete Collection of Dunhuang Documents&quot;, and he agreed, &quot;This is a very important book. You can&#39;t just watch it fail.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Changyue said that Ning Chengchun received the invitation, I was actually very happy in my heart, but my body really couldn’t bear it. The job of declining various design invitations was left to Hu Changyue. When faced with requests from others, Ning Chengchun would most likely nod, &quot;Okay,&quot; &quot;Okay, okay.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun likes natural, folk and humanistic things. The books in his studio are dotted with various traditional artifacts he collected: blue and white porcelain, Pixiu stone carvings, and paper-cuts. His collection is all based on hobbies and nothing expensive or rare. While out hunting, I saw the cute porcelain bowls in farmers’ homes, so I bought a few from the local second-hand market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He took out a set of picture albums that he bought from the Panjiayuan Secondhand Bookstore. They were all full of line-drawn bronzes. He had bought a 32-karat version before and the pictures were very small. This set has a large format and the decorations are clear at a glance. &quot;Actually, there were many good things in ancient times.&quot; Ning Chengchun murmured. In the past twenty years, he has experimented with various traditional patterns, either using them on the spine of books or using a continuous square pattern as the background of the cover. His designs have become increasingly quaint and solemn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Ning Chengchun’s eyes, utensils are used by ordinary people in their daily lives. They are made by unknown craftsmen and may look humble, but they have the beauty of everyday life. Books are utensils that serve people, and they should also have &quot;the beauty of utensils.&quot; Literary theorist Chao Wen once said, &quot;The art of binding is the soul of book aesthetics.&quot; Ning Chengchun deeply agrees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/w6CnLaxNeAhI3NTtNyendEzVb4nrAsxVucvuSfKU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1156&quot; height= &quot;1600&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/w6CnLaxNeAhI3NTtNyendEzVb4nrAsxVucvuSfKU.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252130&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1985, Ning Chengchun was at Kodansha Japan. In the 1980s, he went to Japan twice for further study, allowing Ning Chengchun to truly and systematically study design, and his design concepts were in line with the world. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;This is what this book should look like&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>;A variety of teas are placed on the dining table in the studio. Ning Chengchun always makes a cup of tea when guests visit. The book designer&#39;s studio is also a living room. Editors, printing staff, and suppliers often come to the door. Ning Chengchun has long been accustomed to switching between putting down and picking up design drafts at any time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At home, the time after getting up in the morning and before going to bed at night is the quietest time. Ning Chengchun likes to conceive designs at these moments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After visiting his studio, Zhang Lixian, the founder of Duku, said: &quot;The designers I have come into contact with are all very good-tempered. I think it is because they communicate too much with editors and are polished. I have a good temper.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of Ning Chengchun&#39;s early masterpieces, &quot;The Journey to the West&quot;, designed 12 drafts, three or four plans each time, and submitted it for review several times before it was approved. The highest record is a book on international trade, with 20 drafts designed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the plan was called back, what Ning Chengchun thought was, &quot;Maybe because I didn&#39;t understand the book or didn&#39;t meet his ideas, I will continue to do it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Mindset Only if you are better can you persist for sixty years.&quot; Ning Chengchun attributed this to his family influence. His brother was labeled as a rightist, and the family lost income. His mother taught him from an early age to work seriously, argue for words, and talk less. No matter at school or at work, Ning Chengchun was used to working hard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Ning Chengchun entered the industry in his early days, all he could think about was design. When he woke up every morning, his mind was already spinning even before he was fully awake. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There were many political movements at that time. When a book was published by a publishing house, all the art editors would design it, and then choose from many designs. In other words, it may be in vain. Ning Chengchun didn&#39;t care about this and just kept busy. He is the youngest but has been selected the most times. For many years, Ning Chengchun designed sixty or seventy books every year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1992, when he designed the book &quot;Yixing Zisha Appreciation&quot;, Ning Chengchun had no knowledge of Zisha teapots and tea. He and his photographer traveled to 24 places across the country to take photos of classic Zisha teapots. Due to the limitations of technology at that time, many of the negatives produced were color cast, but Ning Chengchun had seen and touched all the teapots, and listened to the explanations of Gu Jingzhou, an expert on purple clay teapots, so he repeatedly adjusted the color tone of the layout with the plate maker based on his feeling and memory. When printing at the printing factory, Ning Chengchun woke up once every hour and 15 minutes to supervise the color effects, and stared at it for four days and nights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Post-80s designers Xu Yijun and Ning Chengchun went to the printing factory together. During the book printing process, color shades or technical details may not be completely accurate, and some differences are difficult to discern with the naked eye. Designers need to be on-site to help solve the problem. Printing was done all night long, and Ning Chengchun sometimes had to get up in the middle of the night to go to the workshop to look at the samples. Now that he was old, Xu Yijun and other young designers persuaded him to take a rest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Hu Changyue&#39;s eyes, Ning Chengchun&#39;s rigor in publications was beyond imagination. Once when a picture book was being produced, the quality of a picture was not good enough. The editor said that there was only this picture and there was no way to replace it. Ning Chengchun said sternly that if a higher quality picture could not be found, this picture must be used for publication. , he stopped doing it. Finally, he and the editor rummaged through the box and found the negative of the picture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jiaming, former deputy editor-in-chief of Sanlian, compared book design to building a house, “After a book editor has worked hard to compile a good book, he will always consciously or unconsciously imagine what the designer will design it to look like. ”, and the designer arranges the graphics and text content appropriately to create a reading space that looks attractive from the outside, allowing readers to walk in without any obstacles and is pleasing to the eye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;A manuscript is just a stack of paper. To form a book, it must be designed. The quality of the design has a great influence on the book.&quot; Ning Chengchun said that after the book is finished, others will read it and feel that it is a good book. It should look like this, and he would be happy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/c0sy4P7398JfwDUR9toiBjcD4ECRxLJT3qVHMq4X.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1600&quot; height= &quot;1302&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/c0sy4P7398JfwDUR9toiBjcD4ECRxLJT3qVHMq4X.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252131&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;When he entered the industry in his early days, Ning Chengchun designed sixty or seventy books a year. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Design is not just a cover&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>; Ning Chengchun loved books. When he was in middle school, Yang Shuo&#39;s generation of writers came into public view. He read many Chinese literary works. At that time, Tianjin People&#39;s Publishing House and Baihua Literature and Art Publishing House were publishing with high quality, which he still remembers today. Many small books published by Baihua Literature and Art are &quot;very lively and have illustrations. The illustrations of Zhang Deyu and Wang Guofeng are very famous.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun’s eldest brother taught art in school. Under his influence, Ning Chengchun liked painting since he was a child. Mass cultural and artistic activities are also active in Tianjin. Ning Chengchun took the painting class of the district cultural center and went to the old house with several floors to paint in his spare time every week. When he was in junior high school, he published some sketches in newspapers and periodicals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;His first choice in the college entrance examination was the printmaking department. Printmaking played a propaganda role in various movements during the Anti-Japanese War and the early days of the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China. It was &quot;down-to-earth and not too lofty.&quot; At that time, many book illustrations were created by printmakers, and he also hoped to work in a publishing house. In the end, he was admitted to his second choice and entered the Decoration Department of the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts. Three years later, he was transferred to the book art major. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1960s, there was no systematic modern design teaching in China, and most of what Ning Chengchun came into contact with was painting education. For those who study painting, they prefer design literature books, political economic philosophy books, and can only do abstract designs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He clearly remembers the first academic book he designed, &quot;Wittgenstein&quot;. The philosophy book was difficult to understand, and I couldn’t use too concrete paintings to express it. I designed many drafts, but they didn’t pass. Ning Chengchun went to the publishing house&#39;s library to look through the collection of paintings, searching for modern paintings from Wittgenstein&#39;s period, trying to figure out the relationship between Mondrian and others&#39; paintings and philosophy, and finally applied large color blocks to the cover design. Later, when designing a series of triplex academic books, Ning Chengchun would start with abstract patterns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Yijun asked Ning Chengchun why his contemporaries who studied design changed careers one after another, but he persisted. Ning Chengchun thought for a moment and replied, maybe because he went to Japan to study. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun truly and systematically studied design when he went to Japan for further study twice in 1984 and 1986. In Japan, Ning Chengchun personally studied design masters Sugiura Shohei and Manabe Kazuo, and took up basic design courses to integrate with the world in design concepts. At that time, all domestic design relied on painting, and no one knew how to use grids. Ning Chengchun returned from his studies and helped Sanlian usher in the era of picture books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From Ning Chengchun’s graduation to 1995, nearly thirty years of the printing era, all design was done by hand. With the advent of computers, printing was gradually eliminated, and he was still used to designing on paper first. Ning Chengchun did not know how to operate a computer. At that time, the computer company next to the publishing house had five computers. He sat in the middle, drew the layout, and directed five assistants to use the computers to complete the work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Designers of Lu Mingjing’s generation basically complete the entire design process on the computer, while Ning Chengchun still maintains the habit of manual grid design. It was pictures and books that prompted Lu Mingjing to learn from Ning Chengchun. The first task she received was to design Jiang Xun&#39;s &quot;History of Chinese Art for Everyone&quot;. The pictures were many and the text was fragmented, and the layout was difficult to form a block, which was very unsightly. Facing such a book, Lu Mingjing, who had just entered the industry, was confused. Wang Jiaming suggested that she go to Ning Chengchun&#39;s studio to study. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun took out several pieces of octavo paper, a ruler, and a pen, and showed Lu Mingjing how to use a grid to draw a layout, and accurately calculate the number of words on each page and the size of the pictures. &quot;The pictures and text information are all controlled on the manuscript paper, instead of pushing it page by page, and falling into the dilemma of having to redo the entire book if a few pictures are changed.&quot; Lu Mingjing realized that the seemingly backward grid design , actually has its own advantages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While studying at Sugiura Kohei&#39;s studio, Ning Chengchun understood the meaning of what he said: &quot;A book is a universe.&quot; Later, Ning Chengchun introduced Sugiura Kohei&#39;s theory for the first time in China. Sugiura Kohei emphasized the overall design and the core position of the book binding designer in the book design process, &quot;from the layout of the text, text, font, font size, title, table of contents, title page, cover, letter sleeve, belt to the copyright page, and the design of All paper and material selections, and printing and binding process settings are within the scope of the book designer&#39;s responsibilities. Modern book design concepts were promoted in China, and everyone began to understand that design is not just about making a cover. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Yijun observed that in the early days of Ning Chengchun’s design career, design was often regarded as a vassal and branch of painting and lacked independence. As one of the first batch of book designers to study in Japan, Ning Chengchun mastered the professionalism of design. Coupled with his &quot;persistent pursuit of the design profession, including personal talents and opportunities&quot;, multiple factors superimposed to support his departure. Come down. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“I did what I should do for this book”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When Ning Chengchun came back from Japan, he was over forty and his hair began to turn gray. When he made &quot;Chen Yinke&#39;s Last 20 Years&quot; in 1995, his hair turned gray overnight. The 200,000-word manuscript that fascinated him was once stolen along with his backpack. Ning Chengchun couldn&#39;t describe the pain. In just a few days, regret and guilt turned his hair white. Fortunately, two weeks later, the thief who took away the wages left the manuscript at the door of the neighborhood committee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun chose a black cover for this book because both the content itself and the author&#39;s writing made him feel the intensity of emotion and the depression of the atmosphere. He compressed the catalog together, arranged it into an upside-down, fragmented, and disorderly combination, and placed it on the top of the cover to express the condensation of the last 20 years of the author&#39;s life. The photo of Chen Yinke on the lower right was one that Ning Chengchun spotted at a glance from many photos - his eyes were blind, but still bright, and he was holding the crutch tightly with both hands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It particularly represents Mr. Chen&#39;s spiritual atmosphere in his later years, lonely and determined, as if staring at us descendants in the heavy shadow of history.&quot; He believes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Hua, the person in charge of Shenzhen Shangshu Bar, has collected more books designed by Ning Chengchun than Ning Chengchun himself. He began to pay attention to book binding design in the 1990s and found that each book presented a different state. Sanlian&#39;s books were quite different from other publishing houses, being more elegant and heavy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Zhang Hua’s view, Ning Chengchun’s designs reveal a unique Chinese spirit. &quot;His creative language has absorbed the essence of traditional binding very well. He has taken deep roots. He also caught up with the reform and opening up. He went to Japan to study twice and learned modern techniques. He is not conservative at all, which is even more rare.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun often thinks about how to distinguish each book when designing. Every book is unique. To design well, a designer must first understand the author&#39;s thoughts and feelings, and then convey this understanding to readers through book binding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you encounter a book that attracts you, the design is often more inspiring. Ning Chengchun was very moved after reading &quot;Fu Shan&#39;s World&quot;. The author Bai Qianshen is an art history scholar. He originally studied international politics, but turned to calligraphy after studying in the United States. He tells the story of Fu Shan&#39;s ideological changes by examining the society in the late Ming Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When designing, Ning Chengchun used Fu Shan’s calligraphy works as the background. In a chaotic night sky, those characters slightly emitted seven-color light, as if flying from the depths of history, ancient and modern. The book has a wide influence and is constantly reprinted. Bai Qianshen highly approves of it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I did what I should do for this book.” When Ning Chengchun talks about these books that he has never forgotten, his words can go very far. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The understanding between designers and authors sometimes extends from books to reality. After retiring from Sanlian in 2002, Ning Chengchun received direct invitations from many authors. Wang Yuanhua and Zhong Shuhe both wrote letters asking him to design. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cultural relic expert Wang Shixiang asked a publishing house to design &quot;Jin Hui Hei&quot;. When printing, he found that the design format was wrong and could not be printed. He found Ning Chengchun for help. &quot;At that time, he had just lost the sight in his left eye, and he was so anxious that he was really trusting him with his life.&quot; The two became friends from then on. Wang Shixiang sometimes went to the Sanlian Art Studio to look at design drafts and invited Ning Chengchun to have dinner downstairs. Ning Chengchun once witnessed Wang Shixiang instructing the chef to improve the taste of eel paste. The next time he went back, the store made it according to his method. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This is no longer just reading a manuscript, the key points of the manuscript and the author&#39;s taste are all very clear.&quot; Wang Jiaming sighed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Hong Kong triptych edition of Wang Shixiang&#39;s &quot;Research on Ming Style Furniture&quot; is divided into volumes with pictures and texts. Ning Chengchun found it inconvenient to read, so when designing this book, he reintegrated the text narrative, picture explanation, and illustrations. Wang Shixiang&#39;s wife, Yuan Quanyou, did a lot of work for this book. Unfortunately, she passed away before the design of the book was completed. Ning Chengchun knew that Wang and Yuan had been together all their lives and had a deep love for each other, so he temporarily added and changed the design. He chose a black background for the cover, with a line drawing drawn by Yuan Quanyou printed in white gold stamping in the middle. There are two Ming-style chairs designed on the cover of the letter sleeve. One is a photo of the actual object, and the other is a line drawing of Yuan Quanyou, as if the two people met each other in heaven and earth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Hua was moved by a series of Wang Shixiang&#39;s works designed by Ning Chengchun: &quot;The younger generation does not know much about Wang Shixiang&#39;s pursuit and achievements. It can be presented perfectly, and the content and form are completely unified. That is very difficult and can only be designed after full understanding.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some books failed to be implemented according to his ideas, which will also become a regret that Ning Chengchun talks about. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When designing &quot;The Complete Works of Lu Xun&#39;s Manuscripts&quot;, he hoped to put the statue in front of the Lu Xun Memorial Hall - a more natural and life-like appearance - on the cover using 3D imaging technology. The effect was very good, but in the end the publisher chose a safer solution and used the black-and-white photos of Lu Xun in the textbook. Ning Chengchun felt that the design could have been more innovative. Now is no longer the era of &quot;cold eyebrows&quot;. &quot;Lu Xun&#39;s life was difficult and he had a fragile side.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There is nothing we can do about it. You are Party B, and I am Party A.&quot; Ning Chengchun smiled and changed the topic again, &quot;But I will use this method again when I meet the right person in the future. I will definitely It must be suitable, and ordinary people are not suitable.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;It is difficult to overcome loneliness&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun showed Lu Mingjing a sketchbook. He took it with him when he went to participate in the Four Clean-Up Movements in college, and he painted the countryside scenery along the way. It takes two to three hundred miles to walk from the city of Beijing through the suburbs to the countryside of Hebei. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun told her that she could leave now. Lu Mingjing asked, how to go? Ning Chengchun said, arrange a car, let&#39;s go and put our luggage in the car. Are you coming with me? Lu Mingjing agreed wholeheartedly, thinking to herself, oh, I have to do it all over again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;He will encourage you for anything that is beyond what ordinary people can do.&quot; Lu Mingjing discovered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than ten years ago, they met a violin maker together. The workshop is in a small thatched house on a remote hill. The guqin he and his disciples made was expensive enough to allow them to be independent from the world and not have to worry about making a living. Ning Chengchun encouraged Lu Mingjing: &quot;You have to become such a person!&quot; Lu Mingjing had just started working at that time and was a little confused. She understood what he meant - now that she has special skills, she no longer needs to be confused about whether to be born in the world or to join the world. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many of Ning Chengchun’s contemporary designers have become painters and artists. Xu Yijun asked Ning Chengchun, who was also good at painting, if he wanted to become an artist. Ning Chengchun answered firmly: no , I just want to be a designer all the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Xu Yijun was studying design, his classmates generally believed that design would not be a lifelong career. &quot;They all voted with their feet and they all left.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Design has long been regarded as a practical art, and has not been taken seriously in the traditional thinking of attaching more importance to morality than tools. There is a huge difference in social status between artists and designers. Xu Yijun mentioned the fault lines in China’s design industry. There are only a handful of people born in the 1940s like Ning Chengchun who are still writing books. &quot;Although there are very few designers of the older generation, there are still some. This is too precious, otherwise I would be very lonely.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Paper books are already a sunset industry. If you study graphic design, you can switch to Internet product design. Higher income. Xu Yijun said that paper books are not very profitable, and many design companies produce them in batches. &quot;If you spend so much time doing it, it may be difficult to survive.&quot; It is rare for designers of Ning Chengchun&#39;s generation to spend a lot of effort on each book. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Mingjing once divided book designers into different types and styles such as philosophers, engineers, and artists. Ning Chengchun chose the opposite path to artists who express themselves. He has an exciting side, but he is willing to shrink himself and hide his name behind a book. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun emphasized one thing in his book and interviews. At the 8th National Book Design Art Exhibition, a Japanese design theorist looked at the exhibits and said that an author spent a lot of time writing a book. If the designer included personal things in the book, it would be a great disservice to the author of the text. Disrespectful. &quot;This phenomenon is very common among the exhibits in the Eighth Exhibition, which is to break away from the text, or impose the text to create something, in order to attract attention, for personal display of skills, not for the book, not for the text, this pure artistic tendency, he They say this is disrespectful to the book and the author, but no one takes it seriously,&quot; Ning Chengchun told a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun always speaks out directly about things that are not in line with his own ideas. In one event, Ning Chengchun was a judge and felt that the procedures were very unreasonable. Even after he pointed it out, there was no change, and he finally left the venue angrily. &quot;Young people&#39;s awards... are too focused on fame and fortune.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun is very wary of the impetuous and utilitarian atmosphere. &quot;Put utilitarianism first, and everything is for utilitarianism, and that won&#39;t work.&quot; In Japan, he has seen many college students doing carpentry, which is also very good. Society should not be so monotonous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Southern Weekend reporters visited, Ning Chengchun was working on Lei Diansheng’s book. Ning Chengchun admired this hiker who was the first person to cross Lop Nur and traveled all over China in ten years. When he walked in the late 1990s, the economy was booming and all walks of life were making money. However, Lei Diansheng had been preparing for ten years. He had planned all the details in advance and was well-planned and capable. &quot;He relied entirely on one person to overcome many difficulties. It is difficult to overcome loneliness first.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun always reminds Xu Yijun of Lu Xun’s words: Huge buildings are always made of wood and stone. Why don’t we make this wood and stone? I do little bits and pieces from time to time, just for this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Everyone wants to do earth-shattering things and have heroic ideas. There is no point in doing these ordinary things. But now I don’t think so.&quot; Xu Yijun said that many great ancient buildings , such as the Forbidden City, was designed by unknown craftsmen, &quot;It is also important to make ordinary books, and do things in a down-to-earth manner.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Yijun worked with Ning Chengchun for a long time last year. He found that no matter which city he went to, Ning Chengchun always had books to design with him. “Keep reading, keep reading, and eat.” Lie on the bed after dinner, then take out the manuscript and read it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun always said that he only does one thing in his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Xu Yijun and Zhang Huahua changed their names at the request of the interviewees)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 09:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[傅首尔与老刘闹离婚说明了什么？“全职丈夫”难以得到尊重]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257545]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The divorce between Fu Seoul and Lao Liu on the show made the variety show earn enough traffic, but it still It is a soap opera in life. Although it cannot be said to be a bad drama, it is also a plot that many people like me don&#39;t like to watch at all. Even so, we can still learn enough &quot;lessons&quot; from this incident. One of them is that men should be &quot;full-time husbands/full-time dads&quot; because society&#39;s acceptance of this is too low and it is difficult to be respected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fu Seoul and Lao Liu have experienced &quot;poor and lowly couples suffer all kinds of sorrows&quot; and can be regarded as a couple in need. After Fu Seoul rose to prominence through &quot;Qi Pa Shuo&quot;, Lao Liu began his career as a complete &quot;full-time husband&quot; and the source of Fu Seoul&#39;s jokes. In terms of the height an individual can achieve, Fu Seoul is definitely a strong woman and a successful person who uses knowledge and eloquence to embark on a unique track. There is no doubt about this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Lao Liu returned to the family and became a full-time husband, the good stories about their marriage have existed on the Internet for a long time. Every time he participates in the show, Fu Seoul will almost always talk about how good Lao Liu is to him. Fu Seoul and Lao Liu had divorced once before. Later, they remarried. The reason was that Fu Seoul, who was on the rise in his career, had a mess in his work and life after the divorce. Fu Seoul also publicly described this marriage as &quot;the best marriage I could ever encounter.&quot; If this is the case, then why should we go to that step again at this time? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because, the status and relationship between the two people are no longer what they used to be. The ancient saying that &quot;time and status change people&quot; must also exist in marriage relationships. The &quot;economic ability determines family status&quot; that today&#39;s people lament is actually the truth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Lao Liu has advanced in the life of a stay-at-home husband to the point where Fu Seoul kicks him and &quot;knows it&#39;s time to pour out the water&quot;, and Fu Seoul asks Lao Liu to throw away the garbage even though there is a trash can next to him. , they will never &quot;go back&quot;. Regarding the happiness of marriage, there are only feelings left. &quot;I can guarantee that my husband is very happy to be a stay-at-home dad, and I can make money to support the family.&quot; When Fu Seoul said this, Lao Liu was experiencing the most difficult time. This shows that Fu Seoer no longer understands his husband. And Lao Liu also lost himself in being misunderstood and became a symbol. Although he said that he didn&#39;t mind being used as a joke and ridiculed by Fu Seoul on the show, the subtext I realized was: The premise is that you have to respect me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, what did Fu Seoul say? She said: Do you know why a person keeps making salted fish? Because he is suitable to be a salty fish. Once the belief of not seeking improvement is formed, he will even breathe slower than others. You should not push him, because there is no harm if there are no expectations. Of course, there is an element of &quot;program need&quot; in such a statement, but too many details have already revealed that Fu Seoul is increasingly intolerant of Liu&#39;s &quot;not seeking to improve&quot;. She may not even realize that she has regarded Liu as a Stephen Chow It&#39;s a waste of words. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A blogger wrote: Lao Liu was forced to struggle by Fu Seoul. Which full-time housewife has experienced this? Lao Liu became the material for Fu Seoul&#39;s jokes. Which full-time housewife has experienced this? Lao Liu needs to report accounts to Fu Seoul. How many full-time housewives have experienced this? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is indeed not necessarily true. For example, some jokesters will also &quot;operate&quot; on their wives, but overall, Lao Liu&#39;s experience is indeed the real experience of &quot;full-time husbands&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Years ago, an old acquaintance quit his job and became a full-time &quot;housewife&quot; because he had to take care of his children. Although he talked about the pleasure of having a lot of free time when he was drinking with us, in his heart, he became increasingly intolerable to a life where he had to look at his wife&#39;s face even for pocket money and clothes. This is the same thing as the case where Lao Liu wanted to buy clothes he liked but because Fu Seoul didn&#39;t like them, his expectations were wiped out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All the shocking details do not appear out of thin air and have no direction. To put it bluntly, whether it is Lao Liu or some &quot;house men&quot;, they have lost the respect of their wives and been rejected, which has become a normal feature of life. It’s hard to imagine how long this kind of lack of understanding and respect can last. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people didn’t understand Lao Liu’s complaints, thinking it was pretentious and something he did in his spare time. But if the identity were to be changed - if the husband had all kinds of dislikes and restrictions on the stay-at-home wife, wouldn&#39;t many people be upset? In addition, if a stay-at-home housewife complains that she is under great pressure, she is often sympathized with, but you see, after Lao Liu’s difficulties were revealed, many people accused him of not knowing how to be blessed despite being blessed, and of not being considerate of Fu who worked hard outside. Seoul. What a double standard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The difference between a full-time wife and a full-time husband exists objectively. Simply put, stay-at-home wives are more tolerated, while stay-at-home husbands are not. This nature has transcended the scope of a family. The pressure faced by that old acquaintance was not limited to his wife, but also came from the strange looks from the people around him. Some netizens also mentioned various bitternesses when commenting on Fu Seoul and Lao Liu&#39;s divorce. For example, no matter how you explain the &quot;force majeure&quot; of being a stay-at-home husband, you may still be regarded as a &quot;soft ricer.&quot; I would like to ask, have women been looked down upon as &quot;soft rice eaters&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When traditional social concepts have shaped men into &quot;family breadwinners and family responsibility bearers&quot;, in the eyes of some people, it is unforgivable for men to return to the family. This proves that men actually lack the public opinion environment to become full-time husbands. If you do it accidentally, you have to change it. A male compatriot I know started working odd jobs after being unemployed for many days and relying on his wife to support the family. He didn&#39;t make much money and was still looked down upon by his wife, but at least he could &quot;straighten his back a little&quot; in front of his neighbors. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is said that marriage is based on love. Isn’t marriage based on respect? First, if a man really needs to be a full-time husband, the prerequisite must be that he can be respected by his family and society. Since being a full-time wife is a job for a woman, it is also a job for a man to be a full-time husband. He should not be labeled as &quot;eating soft food&quot; or &quot;receiving charity&quot;. Secondly, since the concept that men cannot eat soft rice is still solidified, then a man must think clearly whether his choice is appropriate, whether he can withstand the pressure caused by it in the future, and whether there is a better choice than being a full-time husband. Options? The reality is cruel. When the subtlety and even contradictions in the relationship between husband and wife gradually become apparent due to one&#39;s &quot;full-time&quot; choice, can one calmly bear the consequences of being unhappy or even being confused? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
