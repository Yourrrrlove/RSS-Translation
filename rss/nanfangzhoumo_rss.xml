The Sichuan Public Security Bureau held a press conference with the theme of &quot;Maintaining a Clear Cyberspace and Punishing Cyber ​​Chaos&quot; to inform the province. The public security organs work on cracking down on cyber trolls, cyber criminals, cyber hackers, cyber intrusions and other cyber chaos, and publish relevant typical cases. Among them, the Liangshan Public Security Bureau investigated a case in which an Internet celebrity anchor was created to sell miserable products, staged false images of poverty to attract traffic, hired &quot;internet trolls&quot; to increase followers and attract traffic, and used the traffic to sell counterfeit agricultural and sideline products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/17/f7837762a5dfb77c1f195f36c776d95c.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/17/f7837762a5dfb77c1f195f36c776d95c.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251045&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Basic case&lt; /h4>; &lt;p>;Since June this year, the Liangshan Internet Security Department has discovered illegal and criminal cases involving false propaganda by &quot;Internet celebrities&quot; and selling counterfeit products for profit. Cooperate with institutions, use &quot;helping farmers&quot; as a gimmick, pretend to be ordinary consumers on short videos and e-commerce platforms, follow the established rhetoric in the &quot;Internet celebrity&quot; live broadcast room, follow, comment, and reply, and cooperate with &quot;Internet celebrities&quot; to create &quot;Daliangshan&quot; &quot;Original&quot; character design, selling fake &quot;specialty agricultural products&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After investigation, in order to cooperate with the false propaganda of &quot;Internet celebrities&quot; in the live broadcast room, MCN agencies approached a media company in Baoding, Hebei, and Xu in Beijing and other Internet troll gangs to carry out &quot;export&quot; business. The media company used more than 1,000 business licenses to register advertising accounts on the short video platform, adding 1,000 followers at a price of 100 to 160 yuan, and increasing followers for Internet celebrities in the live broadcast room. Xu received orders through a professional platform and sent them to &quot;computer rooms&quot; in various places to control robot accounts in batches. He disguised himself as a consumer and commented on the origin of the goods and exaggerated the efficacy of the products during the live broadcast, allowing Internet celebrity anchors to post &quot;helping farmers&quot; in a short time. , public welfare and other labels. Through the &quot;streaming&quot; platform, MCN organizations accurately push Internet celebrities to netizens with relevant interests, suitable age groups, and specific areas to achieve the purpose of increasing fans and attracting traffic, creating the illusion of hot products and grabbing orders, and inducing consumers to buy product. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Internet troll gang mainly has the following characteristics:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;01&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;Tightly organized&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Through field visits to local people and investigation Through in-depth investigation by collecting network information, identifying live broadcast gangs, etc., it was found that Internet celebrity anchors performed on the front end and troll gangs diverted traffic behind the scenes, forming an industrialized operation model of &quot;attracting followers - diverting traffic - bringing goods - and monetizing&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;02&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;Highly confusing&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;MCN organization specializes in collecting classic scripts, professionally staged shots, and hired Internet trolls to enhance the atmosphere. What is presented to netizens is Internet celebrities&#39; hard lives and &quot;inspirational&quot; stories of getting rich with goods are used to gain traffic and consume the goodwill of netizens, and then manufacture and sell fake products in pursuit of profit, making it difficult for netizens to tell the truth from the fake. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;03&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;The area involved in the case is wide&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Internet troll gangs are distributed across the country, involving Liangshan, Chengdu, Nanjing, Guangzhou and other places. Each gang uses the Internet to Communication tools serve as link bridges. They do not know each other&#39;s true identities, operate independently, and have obvious decentralization characteristics. The total amount of counterfeit &quot;specialty agricultural products&quot; sold by the Internet celebrity involved in the live broadcast reached more than 20 million yuan, and the products were shipped to all parts of the country, seriously infringing on the economic order of the online market and the legitimate rights and interests of consumers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So far, the Liangshan Internet Security Department has destroyed 3 &quot;cyber troll&quot; companies and arrested 52 suspects, including 2 Internet celebrity anchors, 2 MCN organization members, and 2 supply chain leaders. people. Five online media companies with false propaganda were eliminated, 12 e-commerce platform supply stores were shut down, 13 companies involved in the case were seized, 4 “machine rooms” used to control the volume of live streaming platforms were destroyed, more than 400 mobile phones involved in the case were seized, and 1,500 virtual accounts involved in the case were blocked. More than 5 million yuan of funds involved in the case were frozen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[寻鳄8天8夜]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256918]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 15:12:13&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https:// feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[50万浣熊“入侵”欧洲，“生态害兽”泛滥难解]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256912]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 14:01:31&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/18/SkMGCHEwDIHSiYtOQxnfeARWyJpxmNKlGd47Pcct.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/SkMGCHEwDIHSiYtOQxnfeARWyJpxmNKlGd47 PCct. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251056&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A mysterious &quot;black eyepatch&quot; covers the shiny black eyes. The dexterous front paws resemble the small hands of a human baby and can grip round nuts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of many people, raccoons are cute little animals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Raccoons are native to North America and are named &quot;raccoons&quot; because they often perform cleaning actions near water. However, when they came to the European continent, they were on the &quot;blacklist&quot; of invasive alien species. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as January 2020, the German-language daily &quot;Grenz Echo&quot; reported that raccoons were infested in eastern Belgium, calling it the &quot;raccoon plague.&quot; In September 2023, Belgian authorities once again disclosed that &quot;50,000 raccoons have made their home in the country&#39;s southern mountains.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the first North American raccoons set foot on the European continent, traders planned a profitable fur business. More than ninety years later, raccoon populations have overrun forests and cities, and the problem of biological invasion is imminent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to control the spread of raccoons, some parts of Europe acquiesce or encourage the hunting of raccoons. However, animal protection groups called it a &quot;massacre&quot; and condemned &quot;hunters&#39; attempts to use so-called species protection slogans and flimsy hunting arguments to justify the massacre.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Huo, deputy secretary-general of the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation, told Southern Weekend reporters that around the world, when an invasive alien species (IAS) causes very serious ecological problems, it directly Hunting has become one of the last resort methods of governance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“However, these measures usually require careful planning and execution to ensure their effectiveness and minimize adverse effects.” Wang Huo said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Raccoon &quot;plague&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to Belgian media reports on September 4, Belgium is fighting against &quot;invading&quot; raccoons. Authorities admit that more than 50,000 raccoons have made their home in Belgium&#39;s forested southern mountains and it is too late to eradicate them by hunting them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Céline Tellier, an environment official in Wallonia, Belgium, said in an interview: &quot;This animal looks very cute. Unfortunately, around the world, invasive alien species Species are one of the five major causes of biodiversity degradation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This is an unprecedented and spectacular invasion.&quot; Eric Alkemade, Liège, Belgium A professional hunter in the city told Southern Weekend reporters that since the invasive crisis emerged, he has received many calls about raccoons every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As commissioned by customers, he captures 9-15 raccoons every month. His income has increased significantly thanks to a surge in local raccoon business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In people&#39;s imagination, raccoons are cute little friends. But in fact, if they are not satisfied, they will be very aggressive.&quot; Eric said that raccoons have sharp claws. Will scratch and bite hard. When they cannot find food on balconies, they may sneak into human homes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The damage caused by raccoons is self-evident.” Eric said raccoons can destroy the nests of various birds, including black storks. In addition, raccoons will also attack human poultry and pets, such as &quot;chickens, rabbits, ducks&quot; and so on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the raccoon population is limited, perhaps humans can keep an appropriate distance from these &quot;troublemakers.&quot; Unfortunately, the raccoon population is growing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In recent years, the number of raccoons in continental Europe is estimated to have exceeded 500,000. In addition to Belgium, in many European countries, this animal has also become an invasive alien species that causes headaches for the authorities.&quot; Wang Huo said to the south Reporters over the weekend said that raccoons have been included in the European Union&#39;s List of Invasive Alien Species of Concern since 2016. This means that throughout the European Union, the import, breeding, transport, commercialization or intentional release of raccoons into the natural environment is not allowed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why does the little raccoon make the European Union &quot;colorful&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Raccoons are omnivores and feed on birds, insects, aquatic organisms and plants. Overpopulation will not only compete with native animals for food, but also directly threaten local biodiversity .&quot; Wang Huo said that raccoons can destroy habitats, especially when looking for food. They may dig burrows or destroy trees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, raccoons carry many viruses including rabies, posing a threat to local wildlife and domestic livestock. Raccoons sometimes forage in trash cans, causing waste management and sanitation issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Survival Master&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The introduction of North American raccoons into Europe originated from two man-made species migrations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to public reports, raccoons were introduced to Germany during the Nazi rule in the 1930s for hunting and fur. In the 1960s, many of the animals brought to France as mascots were released by U.S. Air Force personnel, and they took up residence around an air base in the Aisne region of France. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Huo added many details to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1930s, raccoon fur fashion was once popular, and many breeding farms in Germany raised raccoons. However, captive raccoons were not as good as wild ones, so some female raccoons were released into the forests of western Germany. Within ten years, a stable population was established and expanded to eastern Germany. In 1945, due to war air raids, many farmed raccoons escaped and became wild. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Belgium is located between Germany and France, so it has naturally become a migration destination for many raccoons. In their new home, the raccoon population ushered in a period of rapid growth, showing strong adaptability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Huo told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;In the wild, raccoons can find nutritional supplements on land, underwater, in trees, almost anywhere. In cities and towns, raccoons can find food by digging through garbage. , climb into human houses and courtyards to look for food. In addition, raccoons are cute in appearance, and humans are usually not hostile to them.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of breeding strategy, raccoons often choose tree holes, ground holes or caves as their breeding grounds. These places provide a relatively safe and secluded environment that facilitates the survival of the pups. Also, raccoons don’t nurse for long. Raccoon pups are weaned and start living independently by the end of the summer of the same year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Liu, an animal keeper at Nanning Zoo in Guangxi, told Southern Weekend reporters that compared to other mammals, raccoons have stronger reproductive capabilities. For example, monkeys give birth to one baby a year, and they start reproducing at an average age of 3-4 years. Raccoons can give birth to about 4 babies a year, and they mature sexually early. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, raccoons also have many advantages in survival. &quot;In nature, raccoons can swim, dig holes, climb, and can survive on trees and on the ground. In cities, garbage is the easiest way for raccoons to obtain food. However, raccoons also rely on human garbage to survive. But it is bigger than mice, has fewer natural enemies, and can even fight with human pet cats and dogs, so it has obvious advantages,&quot; Mr. Liu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The out-of-control proliferation of raccoons in Europe may also have something to do with the scarcity of wild animals that can control them (such as hawks, falcons, wolves, foxes, etc.). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Huo pointed out that the owl is a common small raptor, but it is fatal to raccoon pups. In nature in Europe, if there are raptors circling nearby, the nursing mother raccoon will be forced to move with her cubs in her mouth and find another safe nest. In a healthy natural ecosystem, a significant proportion of the pups will die in the first 6 months, and only a proportion will survive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eric told Southern Weekend reporters that some Belgian residents hope to use the natural food chain of raccoons to maintain ecological balance through natural enemies of raccoons, such as foxes and wolves. But it was &quot;too late&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eric said that in order to achieve the effect of controlling raccoon numbers, wolves must settle in certain areas for a long time. At the same time, raccoons&#39; rapid reproduction created an imbalance between prey and predators. &quot;This war is already unequal. Without drastic measures, it will be difficult to curb their rapid growth,&quot; Eric said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Hunting&quot; controversy&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In recent years, hunting has become one of the common ways to control the proliferation of raccoons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to data disclosed by the German Hunting Association (DJV), during the 2020-2021 hunting season, German hunters legally captured 200,163 raccoons, a 57-fold increase in two decades. The association also revealed that the number of raccoons hunted has continued to rise since the 1990s. This indicates that &quot;invasive species have spread widely across space.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to control the proliferation of raccoons, there are even organizations that pay special fees to remove raccoons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Belgian hunter Eric told Southern Weekend reporters that he usually accepts commissions from the private sector or local municipal departments to hunt, and is paid monthly, usually 1,500 euros per person. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eric revealed that the local government had used water conservancy and forestry officials to eradicate raccoons, but &quot;their numbers were too few and their equipment was not good.&quot; Eric holds a hunting license and has professional hunting skills. &quot;I go to see the traps I set every day. I have a weapons license, rich experience, and well-equipped equipment.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Eric&#39;s work was not recognized by everyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“A lot of naive people protect and feed raccoons and think I’m a savage.” Eric said that the prevailing animal protection trend has made people sensitive to hunting raccoons, but he feels that his job It is in the public interest and to prevent the spread of zoonotic diseases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, hunting measures have also been opposed by some animal protection organizations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The German People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA-Team) has called for &quot;an end to unnecessary raccoon hunting.&quot; The association offers five reasons for protecting raccoons, including that hunting raccoons is counterproductive because &quot;raccoons may respond to hunting by increasing reproduction,&quot; and that raccoons pose no threat to local biodiversity because &quot;endangered species are rarely Raccoon Food” etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters noted that the organization launched an online petition in July 2022, calling on the European Commission to remove raccoons from the list of invasive species. So far, it has 7,643 supporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In North America, where raccoons are native, people have a more tolerant attitude towards raccoons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;A1 Raccoon Doctor&quot; small animal protection company is located in Toronto, Canada. The company&#39;s main business area is to help customers deal with wildlife invasion, pest protection and other issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Employees of the company told Southern Weekend reporters that they often encounter raccoons at work and often invade human homes. Two months ago, a raccoon attacked people and pet dogs in Vancouver. &quot;The puppy was blinded in one eye.&quot; It also happens that humans become infected with rabies virus after contact with raccoons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in the areas served by the company, people still hold a tolerant attitude towards raccoons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The law does not allow us to hunt wild animals. We only expel some raccoons that have invaded human settlements. Everyone basically has a good impression of raccoons.&quot; An employee of the company told a Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Houston, USA, raccoons often come to the yard of Chinese Xiao Ai&#39;s (pseudonym) home to eat at the &quot;buffet&quot;, which is a self-service feeding box specially set up by Xiao Ai for raccoons. There are also chickens and fish in the yard, but &quot;the raccoons never rumble.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiao Ai said that when she rented an apartment in the past, she often saw raccoons rummaging through public trash cans at night. &quot;But they just go through the garbage and leave after eating. Sometimes neighbors who throw away garbage will encounter raccoons. &quot;Most of them think they are cute, and I have never seen anyone panic or disgusted.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Raccoons don&#39;t Unprovoked invasion and destruction. &quot;In Xiao Ai&#39;s view, humans have invaded the homes of wild animals, causing raccoons to lack food and have to dig through garbage to eat. She opposes the killing of raccoons and advocates the use of sterilization to control the overpopulation of raccoons.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Huo believes that compared with Compared with killing, sterilization is usually regarded as a relatively mild and humane method to control the population of invasive alien species. However, this method also needs to consider factors of time, resources and feasibility.&lt;/p>; &lt;p >; “Controlling the proliferation of invasive species is a complex issue that often requires a combination of measures. &quot;Wang Huo believes that dealing with the problem of invasive species requires comprehensive consideration of various factors, including the characteristics of the species, environmental conditions, and social and ethical considerations. Usually, the best approach is to adopt a combination of methods to maximize Minimize adverse impacts on local ecosystems and economies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 14:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[第31届澳门国际烟花比赛汇演璀璨进行]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256910]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[数据安全榜：守护你的数字财富，哪家金融机构的金盾更坚固？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256908]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 11:27:46&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In the era of digital finance, the security of personal information, especially personal financial information, is related to everyone’s wealth security, and even more so to finance. The mission of the organization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, regulatory agencies have always regarded protecting the security of personal financial information as an important regulatory task. From September 15 to October 15, 2023, the State Administration of Financial Supervision, the People&#39;s Bank of China and other relevant ministries and commissions are jointly carrying out the &quot;Financial Consumer Rights Protection Education and Publicity Month&quot; activity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as April 2021, the People&#39;s Bank of China has issued the &quot;Financial Data Security &amp;nbsp;Data Life Cycle Security Specifications&quot; (JR/T 0223-2021). This &quot;Specification&quot; combines the characteristics of financial data to sort out the security principles, protection requirements, organizational guarantee requirements and information system operation and maintenance guarantee requirements of financial data life cycle, and establish financial data covering the entire cycle of data collection, transmission, storage, use, deletion and destruction. Security management framework. Among them, the protection of personal financial information has become an important part of the security management of financial data life cycle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this sense, the data security of financial institutions is like an indestructible golden shield, and the strength of the golden shield reflects the strength of financial institutions in protecting data security. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to objectively evaluate the data security level of various financial institutions, researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center set up eight secondary indicators from four dimensions, and assigned different weights to the sub-items according to the importance of each indicator. . Under this indicator system, Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center selected the &quot;Data Security List&quot; based on the information related to eight secondary indicators disclosed in the 2022 annual reports, 2022 ESG reports or social responsibility reports of 26 financial institutions. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Given that the data security standards of various financial institutions are quite strict and no serious incidents have occurred, this list only reflects the strategic attention and execution capabilities of financial institutions to data security. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Four dimensions&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Eight sub-indicators&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Data Security Ranking&quot; evaluation The indicator system is divided into four dimensions: organizational construction, institutional processes, technical tools and effectiveness. At the same time, we subdivided the above four dimensions into eight secondary indicators. The following is a detailed description of the relevant indicator system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/jKH2o2u2BWOHs3WZgtu2brTExaaYzLlkJcXIONcM.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height= &quot;968&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/jKH2o2u2BWOHs3WZgtu2brTExaaYzLlkJcXIONcM.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251050&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Organizational Building&lt;/strong>;Yes Refers to the organizational structure of financial institutions in terms of data security. The evaluation team of Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center considers the number of relevant responsible departments disclosed by financial institutions. This indicator reflects the importance financial institutions attach to data security and information protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;System process&lt;/strong>; refers to the degree of standardization of the process of building a data security system by financial institutions. This indicator is mainly comprehensively considered through two secondary indicators: the number of its own relevant systems and the number of supplier management-related normative documents. The degree of standardization of the process is an important indicator to consider whether the construction of the data security system of a financial institution is reasonable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Supplier management&lt;/strong>; refers to the process by which financial institutions conduct effective risk identification and assessment of external partners (IT service providers, cloud service platforms, etc.). Vendors have access to sensitive data from financial institutions. Security vulnerabilities and irregularities in vendor behavior can result in information or data security incidents for financial institutions. Therefore, financial institutions conduct rating reviews of suppliers every year. However, most financial institutions currently only focus on the performance of suppliers in terms of environmental protection and social responsibility. In order to strengthen the importance that financial institutions attach to the management of suppliers&#39; data security, the evaluation team of the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center has disclosed the performance of financial institutions. The number of documents on the supplier management system is also taken into consideration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Technical tools&lt;/strong>; are the core part of the network security system. This first-level indicator directly reflects the financial institution&#39;s ability to protect data and privacy and the effectiveness and reliability of data security. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this first-level indicator, the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center evaluation team set three secondary indicators: the number of relevant patents, the number of relevant systems, and the number of certification systems. Among them, the number of relevant patents refers to the number of patents containing words such as data security, information security, vulnerability and attack in the patent summaries applied for by the financial institution under evaluation that year. The number of relevant systems is based on the number of platforms and systems mentioned in the annual report of the financial institution under evaluation. The number of certification systems comes from the number of certifications published in the annual reports of the financial institutions under evaluation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, during the evaluation process, researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center found that some banks did not disclose the secondary indicator data for this evaluation. Therefore, in order to reduce information asymmetry, financial institutions that do not publish a certain indicator will have the lowest score for that indicator. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Effectiveness&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Indicator&lt;/strong>; is the only qualitative indicator in this list, consisting of the number of security incidents (minus points) and awards (plus points). Among them, the award indicators are assigned different levels of points according to the level and number of awards. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Overall ranking&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;:&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;ICBC&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;tops the list&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;,&lt;/strong>;&lt; strong>;The number of Ping An’s patents is second only to ICBC&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/1Q2N7rJ470IscYbRe50roxJWnSj6t4V2zkk1E7n4.jpg &quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1214&quot; height=&quot;2132&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/1Q2N7rJ470IscYbRe50roxJWnSj6t4V2zkk1E7n4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot; 251053&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The data security list of financial institutions shows that Industrial and Commercial Bank of China ranks first, followed by Bank of China, China Life and Agricultural Bank of China in the second tier. Among joint-stock banks, Industrial Bank and China Everbright Bank performed well. Among them, China Everbright Bank was better in terms of relevant systems and the number of certifications obtained, while Industrial Bank received the award for disclosing detailed data security and privacy protection work in its annual report. More points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of the number of patents, state-owned banks are stronger, and the number of patents of state-owned banks is generally higher than that of joint-stock banks and insurance companies. However, it is worth noting that the number of related patents of Ping An of China, 119, is only lower than that of ICBC, 259. Looking only at this secondary indicator, Ping An ranks second in the entire list. This is because Ping An has both banking and insurance businesses. Compared with financial institutions in a single industry, Ping An&#39;s data is more diverse and complex, and its requirements for ensuring data security are also higher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of comprehensive quantitative indicators, Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China rank among the top three state-owned banks, with total quantitative indicator scores all exceeding 400 points. The Postal Savings Bank of China ranks last with a quantitative indicator score of 196 points, and is the only institution on this list with a total quantitative indicator score of less than 200 points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of comprehensive qualitative indicators, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Life Insurance and Bank of Communications ranked among the top three, with scores greater than 150 points. Among them, ICBC ranks first, mainly because the awards it has received are all national-level and it has been selected as a pilot demonstration unit in multiple fields of data security. China Life and Bank of Communications follow closely behind with multiple awards at different levels in terms of qualitative indicators. In addition, Pacific Insurance, China Merchants Bank, PICC and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank did not disclose awards in their 2022 annual reports, resulting in scores of 0 for their qualitative indicators. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Considering the different nature of banking and insurance businesses, the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center evaluation team split the overall list into two sub-lists: the data security list of banking financial institutions and the data security list of insurance financial institutions. The list is designed to more objectively present the data security competitiveness of financial institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Bank list: &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;While the pursuit is underway&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;, &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;there are leaders in each echelon&lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/gUNn9FWoESsYi8bMLgbU2GEpU9xiJJEfU6gkbE38.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height= &quot;1736&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/gUNn9FWoESsYi8bMLgbU2GEpU9xiJJEfU6gkbE38.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251052&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The data security list of banking financial institutions shows that, Among the six major state-owned banks, the three major state-owned banks, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China, rank in the top three. Bank of Communications and China Construction Bank ranked seventh and eighth. The above five state-owned banks are all ranked in the top ten. The Postal Savings Bank of China ranked last with a score of 125.65 points, a gap of 223.93 points from the first place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Postal Savings Bank’s poor performance in data security may be related to its low level of digital construction. In the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infzm.com/contents/256025&quot; title=&quot;Digital Finance List: ICBC ranks first among banks, AIA ranks last among insurance companies&quot;>;Digital Finance List: ICBC ranks first among banks First, AIA ranked last among insurance companies, Postal Savings Bank of China ranked last among the six major state-owned banks with a score of 431.62. Therefore, the Postal Savings Bank still needs to work hard on digital financial construction and data security system construction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the joint-stock banks, Industrial Bank, Ping An Bank and China Everbright Bank surpassed the two major state-owned banks, Bank of Communications and China Construction Bank, with 238.36 points, 237.24 points and 233.94 points respectively, relying on their advantages in technical tool indicators to rank among Top six. However, the performance of China Guangfa Bank, Hua Xia Bank and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank in terms of data security is not as good as that of some city commercial banks. These three banks are all ranked after the tenth, and are interspersed among the rankings of city commercial banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;City commercial banks are subject to factors such as geography, business volume and scale, and their overall scores are lower than those of state-owned banks and joint-stock banks. But there are also some who perform better. Taking Bank of Ningbo and Bank of Beijing as examples, these two city commercial banks surpassed China Guangfa Bank and Hua Xia Bank, two joint-stock banks, with 185.48 and 172.67 points respectively. From the perspective of qualitative indicators, the results of these two city commercial banks are relatively outstanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Insurance ranking: China Life&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;won&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;award&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;won&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;,&lt;/strong >;&lt;strong>;Ping An patents dominate&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/6E0HX8QJdDA3nDV7hrRH1nhVTesqboNb52zTv5Vt.jpg&quot; border =&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height=&quot;968&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/6E0HX8QJdDA3nDV7hrRH1nhVTesqboNb52zTv5Vt.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251051&quot; >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >; Looking at the data security rankings of financial institutions in the insurance industry, China Life and Ping An of China rank first and second due to their advantages in the number of awards and patents respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the insurance industry, China Life has built the industry&#39;s first safe, green and elastic hybrid cloud. This distributed hybrid cloud won the special prize of the second &quot;Financial Innovation Achievement Award&quot; of the Capital Financial Innovation Incentive Project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of the number of data security-related patents, except for Ping An of China, which received 119 patents due to its business nature of both banking and insurance, the number of data security-related patents disclosed by other insurance institutions did not exceed 5 indivual. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sunshine Insurance ranks low in various index scores in terms of data security, resulting in a total score at the bottom. It is also the only financial institution with a score below 150 in the data security list of financial institutions in the insurance industry. Similar to the Postal Savings Bank, Sunshine Insurance ranked first in the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infzm.com/contents/256025&quot; title=&quot;Digital Financial List: ICBC ranked first among banks, AIA ranked last among insurance companies&quot;>; Digital finance list: ICBC ranks first among banks, and AIA ranks last among insurance companies. It ranks second from last in the digital finance list of insurance financial institutions. Regardless of digital finance or data security, there is still a certain distance between Sunshine Insurance and other financial institutions. However, it cannot be ruled out that the score is related to the small amount of data disclosed by Sunshine Insurance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In general, the digital finance and data security construction of lower-ranked banking financial institutions and insurance financial institutions are not perfect enough.

Another official also confirmed to the media that the supply of this missile is &quot;on the table&quot; and may be included in the upcoming security assistance plan. However, the official also said that no decision has been made yet and that it may take several months for Ukraine to receive the missiles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, Ukrainian President Zelensky publicly declared: &quot;Ukraine needs long-range missiles to deprive the occupiers of the opportunity to use missiles to destroy Ukrainian cities far away from the front line.&quot; The Ukrainian military will ATACMS missiles are regarded as the top priority weapons and equipment to be obtained, even higher than F-16 fighter jets. Before launching a counteroffensive in July 2023, Zelensky even stated: &quot;Without long-range weapons, it will not only be difficult to perform offensive missions, but also difficult to conduct defense.&quot; In short, after tireless pressure, Ukraine seems to be about to get the weapons they want. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So what is so powerful about this missile that Ukraine is so obsessed with? Why does Ukraine think this is the key to its victory? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;ATACMS is a tactical ballistic missile manufactured by Lockheed Martin of the United States. It is also the only ballistic missile currently equipped by the U.S. Army. The development of this missile began in 1980 and is used to attack important targets such as logistics and reserve positions behind enemy lines. The ATACMS missile is equipped with a solid propellant engine, has a range of up to 300 kilometers, and a terminal speed of up to three times the speed of sound. It can be launched from the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and M142 HIMARS, both of which are already equipped. Ukrainian army and performed well in actual combat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of the Ukrainians, the great role of ATACMS is to extend the range of the Seamass rocket launcher that had previously shined in the battle, and its power has also increased. This missile can carry a penetrating high-explosive warhead weighing more than 230 kilograms and is used to destroy strong fortresses with a circumferential error of only 9 meters. This heavy-duty high-explosive warhead is not only extremely lethal to Russian fortresses, but it can also be equipped with a submunition warhead to destroy targets such as airport radar stations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, the key issue is that the range of this missile is far enough. If ATACMS is obtained, the Ukrainian army can directly strike Russian military targets in the Crimea area from the current front, and even directly attack them. Crimean Bridge, and Russia’s air defense system was not sure of intercepting it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Ukrainian army has previously obtained long-range precision-guided weapons such as Storm Shadow with a range of nearly 300 kilometers. Although the effect is good in actual combat, it has not been used many times. The main reasons are the following three problems: First of all, Britain and France, the donor countries for missiles such as Storm Shadow, do not have much equipment themselves, so the quantity they can provide to Ukraine is also quite limited; secondly, such missiles can currently only be mounted on modified Su-24 fighter-bombers. However, Ukraine&#39;s air force has suffered heavy losses after more than a year of fighting. The number it can dispatch is limited, and it also needs to be careful about interception by Russian fighter planes. Therefore, it can only hide dozens of kilometers behind its own front lines, which also reduces the range of missiles. shortening; another technical problem is that air-launched missiles often have higher requirements for reconnaissance of the target area. For example, the missile needs to inject a three-dimensional image of the target building so that it can hit a more precise vulnerable location, which is also more effective for pre-attack reconnaissance. High requirements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, ATACMS can avoid the above problems. First of all, the US military has equipped more than 2,000 of this missile, and other allies also have more than 1,000 in stock. The United States is planning to phase out this missile and switch to a missile with a longer range. Once the United States relents on its long-range replacement model, the amount of supply to Ukraine will be considerable, which will also help the United States update its army&#39;s long-range missile weapons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, Ukraine already has dozens of Haimas and M270 systems that can launch ATACMS in service, and land-based launch platforms are easier to conceal and can fire closer to the battle line. As long as the number of missiles is in place, the frequency of attacks will increase. can be greatly improved. In addition, the reconnaissance business before the launch of surface-to-surface ballistic missiles will also become relatively simple. You only need to know the geographical coordinates of the target to launch it. If this missile is deployed in large numbers, it will be difficult for the Russian navy and air force to gain a foothold in the Crimean Peninsula, because these high-value targets will be attacked with high frequency and difficult to defend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once the United States provides ATACMS, it will have a chain effect. Ukraine has repeatedly requested Germany to provide Taurus air-launched cruise missiles with a range of nearly 500 kilometers. This missile has a range of more than 500 kilometers and is more powerful than Storm Shadow. for safety. Another advantage of the Taurus is that it uses a two-stage tandem warhead, which can penetrate the outer wall of the fortification and explode inside, with an intelligent killing effect. Germany had been quite hesitant to provide this weapon because it was unwilling to bear all the pressure from Russia. If the United States is willing to provide ATACMS missiles, Germany should also release Taurus, which will undoubtedly increase Ukraine&#39;s long-range attack capabilities. It can be seen that the changes brought about by ATACMS may be far more than its own fatal lethality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 11:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[人贩子余华英一审被判死刑，曾拐卖儿童11名]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256906]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 11:03:18&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;On September 18, the Guiyang Intermediate People’s Court publicly sentenced the defendant Yu Huaying to one count of child abduction and trafficking. case.

Leaving the breasts exposed. After September 1st, the woman involved continued to post multiple videos describing her injuries and treatment, which aroused widespread concern among netizens. On September 6th, she also accused the police in a video of unfair enforcement of the law and rudely &quot;called her crazy&quot;. Ferments quickly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, as all parties expressed their opinions, the jigsaw puzzle of the truth of the incident was slowly being completed: it was obviously the woman involved who &quot;bited&quot; and caused minor injuries to the other person, but she used the attitude of the evildoer to complain first to mobilize public opinion She went on the offensive, accusing the other party of bullying and beating her; the woman involved not only refused to mediate, but even fabricated the fact that the police &quot;forced her to accept mediation&quot;, spread rumors that the police enforced the law unfairly, and attempted to use public opinion pressure to force all parties to make concessions. During this period, certain media outlets also added fuel to the flames and acted as advocates for the woman involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Police records show that the neighbor couple lives on the 9th floor, and the woman in question lives on the 14th floor. At about 18:00 on August 26, a neighbor couple took the elevator home from the first floor. When the elevator reached the first floor, the woman in question entered the elevator holding an adult Samoyed dog. The neighbor&#39;s wife asked the woman to pull the dog away out of fear, and the two got into an argument. After the couple got out of the elevator on the 9th floor, the woman chased them out of the elevator, and the couple got into a fight in the corridor. The neighbor&#39;s wife called the police twice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The police also told the media that the neighbor’s wife had scratches on her limbs and waist, and a small amount of hair was torn off; the husband had bite marks and bruises on the back of his left hand and left forearm, and scratches on his right arm; the woman involved There were pinch marks on his neck, scratches on his face, and a small amount of hair torn out. The case was classified as a fight that night, and the police conducted mediation on the spot. The woman involved had accepted the mediation, but two days later she released a video stating that she did not recognize the mediation results. The public security agency immediately opened the case for investigation in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What the police said was, &quot;If you keep acting like this (in Zigong dialect, it means stubborn, extreme, and accepting death), we will not mediate.&quot; They did not say the harsh words &quot;if you do not mediate, you will be detained.&quot; ; Judging from the video in the elevator, the two parties only communicated verbally in the elevator and had no physical contact. It was not until the couple arrived at their own floor and left the elevator that the woman in question chased them out of the elevator, and a physical conflict broke out between the two parties. As a result, the woman involved is not even suspected of &quot;defensive provocation&quot; or active provocation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The testimonies of both parties showed that the husband did not take action, but was bitten by the woman involved, and the injuries were assessed as minor injuries; both the wife and the woman involved were also injured, but the woman involved refused to have their injuries assessed. , and hit the neighbor&#39;s wife with his mobile phone at the mediation scene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The neighbor’s wife also said in an interview that because she was afraid of dogs, and she had just given birth to a child, she was worried that the hair would stick to her hair and cause adverse reactions in the child, so she asked the other party to keep the dog away. A quarrel ensued, leading to a fight in the corridor outside the elevator. On September 10, the Zigong High-tech Zone Police responded that from the afternoon to the evening of the 9th, the police had once again conducted a comprehensive inquiry and investigation on all parties involved, and would handle the case in accordance with the law after the inquiry and investigation are completed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the evolution of this case, the woman involved can be called a &quot;spin doctor&quot;. Her series of manipulation techniques amplified public opinion and turned an originally simple interpersonal dispute into a scandal. It became a widely publicized public event. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The woman in question keenly selected several &quot;traffic codes&quot;: she complained about the police leading to the public opinion impression of &quot;police and mud&quot;; she cried about &quot;being refused to bring a dog into the elevator&quot;, hyped up and called &quot;dog lovers&quot; &quot;Support; in the end, she also created her own image as a &quot;vulnerable group&quot;. It seems that a woman with her cute Samoyed dog was bullied by the other party&#39;s overwhelming numbers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sequence of events is clear enough. The woman in question bit the neighbor&#39;s husband to a minor injury and at the same time fought with the neighbor&#39;s wife, which is in line with the first situation mediated by the Public Security Bureau, that is, a &quot;dispute between relatives, friends, neighbors, and colleagues.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, the wounds and scars on the hand of the neighbor’s husband met the standard of “minor injury”. Minor injuries refer to minor damage or temporary dysfunction caused by local tissue and organ structures of the human body. This injury standard does not seem serious, but it still requires corresponding legal consequences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 43 of the &quot;Public Security Administration Punishment Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; stipulates that anyone who beats others or intentionally injures others shall be detained for not less than 5 days but not more than 10 days, and shall be fined not less than 200 yuan but not more than 500 yuan. ; If the circumstances are relatively minor, he shall be detained for not more than 5 days or fined not more than 500 yuan. Article 17 of the &quot;Interpretation of the Supreme People&#39;s Court on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in the Trial of Personal Injury Compensation Cases&quot; also stipulates that the personal injury suffered by the victim and the resulting expenses include medical expenses, lost work expenses, nursing expenses, transportation expenses, accommodation expenses, and hospital meals. The person obligated to compensate shall compensate for economic losses such as subsidies and necessary nutrition fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the woman involved is unwilling to accept mediation, she needs to bear administrative liability and civil liability for &quot;minor injuries&quot;. Although the neighbor&#39;s wife was also responsible for the assault, the woman involved refused to have her injuries examined. Secondly, even if the neighbor&#39;s wife was administratively detained for this, her status as a nursing mother would exempt her from punishment. Therefore, the police&#39;s mediation suggestion was actually a more beneficial result for the woman involved. However, she refused to do so and even tried to devour the other party. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, faced with the legitimate fear of a nursing mother, the woman involved, as a dog owner, should be kind to the dog owner, soothe the other person&#39;s emotions, and respect other people&#39;s living space. However, she did the opposite. , and trying to manipulate public opinion is indeed regrettable. Not only that, the woman involved refused to have her injuries assessed or to mediate, which actually pushed herself into an unfavorable litigation situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ironically, although there were pets in this case, a &quot;human biting&quot; situation eventually occurred. The woman in question bit her neighbor&#39;s husband and showed indifference to the rights of nursing mothers. In addition to administrative and civil responsibilities, the woman involved is also suspected of defamation and even rumors and frame-up. This is an illegal and criminal act that the public security organs should continue to seriously investigate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;

I was walking on the streets of Hefei when I suddenly heard a loud noise behind me. When I looked back, I was shocked out of my mind. A piece of concrete and ceramic tile mixture the size of a washbasin fell from a building more than ten stories high and hit me about two meters behind me. The debris from the impact splashed on my pants. I was so frightened that I turned pale. I really felt that life was so fragile and that I was so close to death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later I talked about this distress in my circle of friends and social media, and I was thankful for my good luck. Unexpectedly, netizens have talked about nearly ten people who have encountered similar situations! It turns out that falling objects from heights are not an occasional phenomenon, but a frequent social problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the following months, four more incidents of falling objects from high altitudes occurred in my circle of relatives and friends. Two of them happened in the community where my sister lives (which was delivered in 2007): both times, weathered and peeling pieces fell from the top of the building. Once, the mortar hit the seat of the electric motorcycle, but no serious damage was caused; the other time was more serious. It was serious, the roof of the car was damaged, and the property management paid 3,000 yuan in compensation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Supreme Court&#39;s 2020 &quot;Trends and Characteristics of Cases of Falling Objects Injuring People from Height&quot; report shows that civil cases of falling objects from heights are increasing year by year, and nearly 30% cause casualties. Xu Jianfeng, director of the Supreme People&#39;s Court Information Center, said: 18.16% of cases involved fatalities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Professional legal practitioners introduced more detailed and specific technical details of cases of falling objects from high altitude:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the influence of the earth’s gravity, high-altitude objects have huge potential energy and fall close to the ground. At this time, it is converted into kinetic energy. At this time, the speed is fast and the momentum is large. When hitting the human body, the human body will receive a large impulse and force. A 30-gram egg dropped from the 4th floor can break a person&#39;s head; if dropped from the 18th floor, it can break a person&#39;s skull. Even lighter cigarette butts, fruit cores, cans... falling from high altitudes are likely to cause casualties once they hit the human body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than 60% of criminal cases caused by falling objects occur in residential areas. They are closely related to the people, are related to personal safety and social stability, and cannot be ignored. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to &quot;Qingdun Data&quot;: From 2014 to 2020, more than 1,450 high-altitude parabolic cases were concluded by courts across the country, showing an overall rapid growth trend. Among them, in 2020 alone, 451 cases were concluded. These are only the cases concluded by the courts. Many of the cases are minor and the cases where the parties have gone through mediation or reconciliation are not included in the calculation. According to incomplete statistics, there are actually more than 1,000 cases of high-altitude parabolic objects occurring in my country per year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are four main reasons for high-altitude throwing cases: those who throw objects for convenience and casually account for the most, accounting for 55.1%; crimes of passion caused by quarrels and disputes account for 29.7%; malicious venting accounts for 13.2%; Laziness accounts for 2% of the cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above four types are classified as criminal cases of man-made thrown objects. In addition, falling objects from heights are also caused by the aging of buildings: the cement and ceramic tiles on the exterior walls of buildings have been damaged by wind, sun, and damage for many years. Rain... peel off and fall off after weathering. For example, the author was in danger and the vehicle in my sister&#39;s neighborhood was damaged by falling objects, which were all caused by the aging of the building exterior walls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Friends in the construction industry said that most of my country&#39;s high-rise buildings were built rapidly during the &quot;explosive development of real estate&quot; in the past 25 years or so, and it took a quarter of a century to go through four centuries of Western development. The development history of architecture. Many buildings are built quickly and in a hurry to meet the schedule. Of course, the quality of slow work and meticulous work cannot be achieved, and there are many potential hidden dangers. After more than 20 years of exposure to wind, sun, and rain, many buildings lacked maintenance, and problems gradually began to appear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Communicate with friends in the construction and property fields and learn about some ways to reduce the risk of falling objects caused by aging buildings. For example: not only should problems such as illegal construction and illegal renovation be dealt with, but also structures such as &quot;parapets&quot; on the top of old high-rise buildings should be demolished; exterior wall tiles can also be transformed into exterior wall paint, so that even if there are paint chips and wall dust falling off , it is not as lethal as the concrete and ceramic tile mixture falling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, in traditional markets in southern cities such as Guangzhou, there were long corridors extending above the storefronts along the street and connecting them to one another. In the past, it was mainly used to shade the sun and rain, and to facilitate attracting customers and doing business. However, this kind of building structure has inadvertently become a buffer for falling objects from high altitude, reducing the casualty rate in accidents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem of falling objects from heights deserves attention and cannot be solved solely by legislation, judiciary, publicity and education. If you wait until after a casualty accident occurs before trying and making compensation, this kind of hindsight will not only fail to solve the problem, but will actually increase social instability. It’s the old saying: As long as your thinking doesn’t slip, there are always more solutions than difficulties. Combined with the current reconstruction of old cities, there are always ways to deal with the problem of falling objects from heights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
