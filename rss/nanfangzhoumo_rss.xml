After peeling off the cocoon, the truth emerged: the scenic spot illegally occupied agricultural land, the construction side&#39;s capital chain was broken, and the developer&#39;s legal representative was still running around while on probation. Sculpture is the &quot;face&quot; of a place, but it should also be the lining that shapes the humanistic connotation.

For example, young people Signing up for the &quot;Sunset Red&quot; tour group, some office workers who don&#39;t want to order takeout flocked to the canteen for the elderly, and some young people squeezed into various interest classes at the university for the elderly and discovered &quot;really delicious&quot;... These new trends on social platforms, It is ridiculed by the outside world as &quot;old-fashioned consumption&quot;. Why has moving closer to the consumption patterns of middle-aged and elderly people become the “life they aspire to” for many young people? How to treat it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, I think the direct motivation for &quot;old-fashioned consumption&quot; is low price attraction. Whether it is a &quot;Sunset Red&quot; tour group, a canteen for the elderly, or a university for the elderly, what they all have in common is the relatively low price. The presupposition is that the elderly retire from their jobs and have no financial resources except pensions. With little other income, the selling price of goods or services targeted at this group is naturally lower than the normal market price. More importantly, as part of the social security system for the elderly, the government pays for some services or items (in this case, there is some controversy about young people taking advantage of the elderly), and some businesses have also started to pay for them in order to promote sales. Give it to the elderly. The fact that young people are &quot;mingling among them&quot; undoubtedly reflects their pursuit of low-priced goods or services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, traveling can be regarded as a relaxing experience. The recipes in the elderly canteen will most likely not be any different. The courses taught by the elderly university cover flower arrangement, painting, calligraphy and other talents and skills. Skills, the quality of these goods or services will not be too bad. In other words, it is not an exaggeration to say that the above-mentioned goods or services have the basic characteristics of &quot;high quality and low price&quot; and good cost performance. Young people have discovered this opportunity and made full use of it to enrich and enrich themselves. I think it is a wise move. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, this truly reflects the objective fact that young people are under great pressure to survive. The overall economy is in a downward trend, the population is aging, the subsequent impact of the epidemic has not been completely eliminated, and the number of college graduates is increasing. The competition for employment is extremely fierce and it is difficult to find a job. At the same time, they are also faced with work pressure, promotion pressure, renting and buying a house, pressure to get married and start a family, pressure to have children, etc. To be honest, the overall survival and development situation of contemporary young people Not optimistic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Considering specific activities such as traveling and attending classes at senior universities, we believe that young people’s participation in them is a response to the high-intensity, high-pressure, and fast-paced production that young people generally find themselves in in the context of urbanization and modernization. A kind of resistance, rebellion and temporary escape (escapism) from the way of life. Faced with various production and lifestyles with &quot;involution&quot; as their basic characteristics, which have no way to escape, young people can actively debug, adjust and make some changes, and achieve relief and decompression through travel, study, etc. Purpose, I think it is a pretty good thing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, &quot;old-fashioned consumption&quot; should not be understood in a narrow sense as the field of consumption, but should be interpreted from the perspective of the specific consumption process and the concrete experience in the consumption process, that is, the social nature of consumption cannot or is not easily ignored. feature. The core essence of &quot;old-fashioned consumption&quot; is that young people and the elderly get along and interact with each other for a certain period of time. Travel can be as short as one or two days, as long as three to five days or a week, to eat in the elderly canteen and to attend classes at the elderly university. This allows young people and older people to spend more time together, and such interactions will produce significant learning effects. And this kind of learning is two-way rather than one-way, because through such interactions and exchanges, young people can gain life experience provided by their elders, and the elders can be infected by the vitality or passion of young people. Especially for the elderly, if young people are willing to listen to their stories or sharing, they usually feel happy and satisfied, and their sense of self-worth will be significantly enhanced. In this sense, the precise expression of &quot;old-fashioned consumption&quot; should be &quot;mutual consumption&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A direct effect of this &quot;old-fashioned consumption&quot; is to repair or improve the relationship between young people and their older relatives in their families or clans. In reality, there are some young people, especially young men, who have little communication with their parents. They often keep a distance from their parents in the name of generation gap. This is the so-called &quot;disconnection&quot; phenomenon, but they have no relationship with their parents outside. Communication among the elderly is tolerant, and some young people often take the initiative or actively communicate with the elderly. Obviously, occasional or regular participation in &quot;old-fashioned consumption&quot; will undoubtedly have a positive effect on increasing the close relationship between young people and their families. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for &quot;old-fashioned consumption&quot;, some people may think that this will squeeze out the resources of the elderly. A bunch of chattering young people suddenly join the tour group, and the elderly will feel that the young people have somewhat affected their &quot; &quot;The right to tranquility&quot;; when a bunch of young people suddenly come to join in the fun in the seniors&#39; canteen, the old people will feel it is too noisy; when a bunch of young people suddenly break into the classroom to teach, the old people will feel crowded and uncomfortable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The more fundamental doubt is that the above-mentioned various special services or benefits only for the elderly are paid for by the government and are part of the security system for the elderly. Now, young people are flocking to them, and there is obvious The rights or rights of the elderly are suspected of being raided. But the author believes that we should not understand the word &quot;resource&quot; statically. If the elderly or even most elderly people benefit from and acquire it because of the participation or joining of young people, this is undoubtedly another hidden precious resource. It should be noted that resources are not only economic-oriented, but also include social-oriented resources in a broad sense, which mainly refers to the level of social communication and social interaction; resources are not limited to initial static resources, and resources in a broad sense also exist after the initial resource investment. Learned resources, we might as well imagine the latter as the multiplier effect in the field of economics or investment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What I mean is that a cross-age or mixed-age (fixed structure) population structure usually produces a good comprehensive effect because each other benefits from or benefits from mutual exchanges and learning. We can also understand it as the application or application of economies of scale and economies of scope theories in daily life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I couldn’t help but think of two things. One is in Japan. During the layout process, some kindergartens or primary schools will choose to be adjacent to nursing homes. At eight o&#39;clock in the morning, the elderly can hear the sound of reading aloud from next door as scheduled; at four o&#39;clock in the afternoon, the elderly will see the school after school at the entrance of the nursing home. The children bowed to themselves and politely said &quot;Hello Grandpa&quot; and &quot;Wish you a happy day, Grandma&quot;; on weekends or holidays, a group of children and their teachers came to the nursing home to perform performances for the elderly, eat together, and Play games, and as feedback, the elderly can occasionally or often go to the school next door to talk about the past and present lives of their city or community. I believe that this is the proper meaning of &quot;being productive in old age&quot; and &quot;being happy in old age&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The other is that in recent years, some domestic cities have proposed to build urban development goals for specific groups. For example, Shanghai proposed to build an age-friendly city, Beijing proposed to build a youth-friendly city, and Shenzhen proposed to build a child-friendly city. Changsha proposes to build a female-friendly city. I just wonder, if this kind of special care for a certain group of people is singled out and used as an important part of urban development goals or urban development strategies, isn&#39;t it suspected of &quot;social deprivation&quot; for other groups? ? What do you mean by just being friendly to the elderly? Unfriendly to young people? Not child friendly? Is its essential point that when this kind of preferential policy for specific groups of people is used as an urban development goal or strategy, there will inevitably be a package of follow-up measures in terms of funds, projects, policies, planning, etc. To put it more bluntly, It means that a lot of real money is invested in specific groups of people, which is obviously not fair and reasonable for other groups. In the long run, this move is intended to harm or harm the city&#39;s diversity, inclusiveness and equity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similarly, I also disagree with the suggestions or suggestions of some people and even some experts to build special women&#39;s (subway) carriages or children&#39;s (high-speed rail) carriages. Why can’t we build a high-end society that is gender-friendly, gender-equal, and gender-integrated through extensive publicity and innovative practices? Why can&#39;t we be tolerant of children who are active or crying, or even adopt more positive and proactive methods, such as actively chatting with children, playing games, playing poker, etc., so that children can feel the affection of uncles, aunts, brothers and sisters in the carriage? What about warmth? Obviously, whether it is a women&#39;s (subway) carriage or a children&#39;s (high-speed rail) carriage, they are all short-sighted moves aimed at evading and avoiding the problem, and they are all deliberately or deliberately aimed at &quot;distinctiveness&quot; and &quot;community isolation&quot; ” (social segregation), all of which are against or deviating from the basic principles of mixed-age or cross-age. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a professor at the Department of Sociology, Guangzhou University)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010; &quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 22 Nov 2023 15:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[南周x读库2024联合征订，买1得10，错过等1年！]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261065]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-22 15:08:03&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;&lt;span>;&lt;span>;At the beginning of this year, we [Nanzhou x Reading Library] joint subscription was launched.

This has also become a topic of widespread concern. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;my country&#39;s soil pollution laws and regulations were promulgated relatively late. In 2019, the Soil Pollution Prevention and Control Law began to be implemented. Combined with other documents, three situations require soil pollution status investigation: The first is the change of land use to residential, public management and public services (referred to as &quot;one residential, two public&quot;); the second is the construction land plots with soil pollution risks; the third is the change of land use for production and operation of key soil pollution supervision units, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to the requirements of laws and regulations such as the Soil Pollution Prevention and Control Law, soil environment investigation reports must be disclosed to the public in accordance with regulations, but the legal provisions on information disclosure are not specific enough. Soil pollution is hidden, and home buyers need to check the land use history. Generally speaking, it is safer if the land was originally farmland, residential, public facilities, or green space park types, and there are basically no other migration pathways for pollutants in the surrounding land. If it is a converted contaminated site, you need to pay attention to the results of soil assessment. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Soil information disclosure is uneven&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Because there are no clear regulations, there are various channels for soil information disclosure, making it difficult to search with one click. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Guo Lei, a staff member of the environmental protection organization &quot;Guangzhou Green Network Environmental Protection Service Center&quot; (hereinafter referred to as Green Network) told the Southern Weekly reporter that our country&#39;s laws do not provide for soil In what channels should the environmental investigation report be made public, what content should be made public, etc. In actual situations, some reports are made public on the websites of real estate developers, and some are published on industry forums of companies commissioned to investigate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since 2016, Green Network has regularly collected from hundreds of websites and compiled tens of thousands of reports related to soil pollution investigation and remediation for free public review. However, public awareness of this aggregated information is not high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The professional nature of information disclosure content also increases the difficulty for users to access it. The public generally searches for the subdivision or developer name, but reports often use parcel numbers provided by the Department of Natural Resources. Moreover, most of the public reports are simplified and lack location diagrams, making it difficult for the public to correspond their property and plot numbers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporters searched the Green Network database using &quot;Beijing&quot; as the keyword and found that the vast majority of the 15 preliminary investigation reports displayed on the homepage were only Some are about 2 pages long, including a brief description of basic soil conditions, investigation plans and investigation conclusions; some are as long as 130 pages, or the full text and on-site photos are disclosed in detail. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Guo Lei said that the simplified report lacks data such as sampling point maps and pollutant concentration distribution, making it impossible for outsiders to conduct detailed analysis. It is easy to judge whether the sampling process was standardized based on the photos, but the report did not present sampling photos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;There is still a big gap in the information disclosure intensity and quality of soil environmental investigation reports compared with air, water, environmental assessment and other reports.&quot; Guo Lei suggested, Specific information disclosure specifications should be formulated and a unified release platform for information disclosure should be established. Especially for residential buildings and schools redeveloped from land used by heavily polluting industries, developers need to disclose detailed information, and home buyers and parents of students must make careful choices. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; How to change the &quot;treasure land&quot; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; If the soil is in place, there are many cases of &quot;poisonous&quot; &quot;treasure land&quot; cases of &quot;treasure land&quot;. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In 2008, the Beijing Chemical Second Factory in the southeast suburbs of Chaoyang District, Beijing was discontinued, and land was transferred to the State Organ Affairs Administration for residential land development. Dr. Yang Jin, chairman of Shi Pu Testing Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., has participated in the soil environment survey and testing of the project. Yang Jin introduced that the project&#39;s soil survey and restoration lasted for many years and cost more than 1 billion yuan. The Guanghua New Town Community was built, and residents stayed at the end of 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;Poisonous Land&quot; to change the &quot;treasure land&quot; requires a long assessment and repair process. Three stages of soil pollution survey will go through three stages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The first stage is pollution identification, mainly based on data collection, on-site investigation and personnel interviews; Entering the second stage of pollution confirmation, it is divided into preliminary and detailed sampling analysis, and prepares the survey report of soil pollution; the third stage is to supplement sampling and test, obtain the parameters required for risk assessment and soil and groundwater repair. The stage of investigation can be carried out separately, or it can be carried out at the same time during the second stage of investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Yang Jin introduced that the preliminary investigation of soil pollution status is small, generally a grid cloth with a 40m × 40m, which is equivalent to the area of ​​the four basketball courts. A sample, from the formulation plan to the analysis results, usually takes 2-3 months. If pollutants are detected in the preliminary investigation, a detailed survey needs to be surveyed. The sampling density is increased to a grid of 20m × 20m, which is equivalent to the area of ​​a basketball court. About 3-6 months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; After the survey of soil pollution status and risk assessment work, soil repair should be performed.

It can be roughly divided into physics. , Chemical and Biological: the technical principles are pollutants in the soil to transfer, absorb, degrade, and transform the soil, reduce its concentration to acceptable levels, or convert toxic and harmful pollutants into harmless substances. According to the repair mode, it can be divided into in situ and abnormal repair. The difference is whether to move the pollution soil. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The soil repair effect also needs to be evaluated. my country&#39;s implementation of soil pollution risk management and control of the construction of the construction land. The pollution land in the list should be reviewed by the provincial ecological environment department organization to achieve the established management control or repair goals. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; It is difficult for the public to judge the quality of the report &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Even if the soil environment is conducted, the information is better, but the quality of the report is not bad Qi, the professional threshold is high, and it is difficult for the public to read. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;These reports are prepared for professional companies, and they have passed expert review. It&#39;s easy to find. &quot;Guo Lei admits that ordinary residents want to judge whether the quality of the report is qualified, which is more difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The pollutants and atmosphere and water in the soil are not evenly distributed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Gao Jie, Secretary-General of Zhongguancun Zhongxin Soil Repair Industry Technology Innovation Alliance, told Southern Weekend reporters that the soil is multi-phase, non-average, and pollutants are underground underground The naked eye is not visible. During the soil investigation process, it may cause pollutants to fail to discover in time due to technical and cost restrictions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Soil repair has certain uncertainties and cannot guarantee that &quot;must be repaired&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Yang Jin said that there is a phenomenon that the pollutants are still exceeding the standard after the soil repair is completed, and even the organic pollutants in some areas &quot;more and more&quot; more and more &quot;more and more&quot; more repairs &quot; &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; There are two main types of pollutants in the soil-heavy metals and organic matter. Heavy metal migration is weak, and the repair is relatively simple. Generally, there are chemical solidification, scrubbing, and separation method. The organic migration is strong, and generally uses thermal extension, chemical oxidation or biological repair method. Organic pollutants may migrate under groundwater and other media, and the soil process disturb the underground pollutants, which may migrate it to a larger range. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Gao Jie suggested that during the development process, we must strengthen the awareness of soil pollution prevention, such as soil mining and flipping, pay attention to observe whether the color and odor is abnormal, and it can be equipped with XRF, and XRF, and XRF, and XRF, and XRF, and XRF, and XRF, you can be equipped with XRF, and you can be equipped with XRF and XRF. PID and other fast screening instruments can quickly judge whether the soil is polluted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The regulatory authorities should take good off beforehand. According to the statistics of Green Network, since 2019, the land user owners of more than 300 plots across the country have been punished by the ecological and environmental departments for no soil pollution survey or risk assessment before the development of the land. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;Even if the report was found, the house may have been built at that time, and the difficulty of solving the problem has become more complicated.&quot; Guo Lei said that at present, at present The ecological environment department is improving the supervision system and requires investigating companies to record the sampling plan in advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In July 2022, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment issued the &quot;Preliminary Investigation and Supervision and Inspection of Soil Pollution of Construction Land (Guidelines for Trial)&quot;, which stipulates that the municipal-level ecological environment department Carry out supervision and inspection of sampling analysis work plans, on -site sampling, and laboratory testing and analysis. The provincial ecological environment authorities can organize random inspections for survey reports that have passed the review. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In addition to the supervision of local environmental protection departments, Green Net will also report similar clues discovered. &quot;It is possible that some plots that should have been conducted by the soil environment but not did. It was neither discovered by us nor was discovered by the environmental protection department.&quot; Guo Lei said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Guo Lei explained that there are two important reasons for soil pollution surveys before development: First, soil pollution investigation is not like a planned license and a construction permit. It is widely aware that many developers do not know to do soil pollution surveys and need to further strengthen the publicity of law popularization. Second, many local ecological environment departments do not fully grasp the information change information, and need to share information about the natural resource department. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; Is the development of high pollution land worthwhile &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Yang Jin observed that when the real estate industry was hot in previous years, the high-pollution industry plot Also very popular. &quot;Even if the soil environment survey and restoration cost several years, it costs hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars, but because of the generous return, it is still difficult to stop the enthusiasm of the developer.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left &quot;>; Today, local governments and developers are also reflected that in order to develop houses, they pay such a large cost to repair a difficult and uncertain soil, and it is worth it to bear follow -up risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The &quot;Regulations on the Prevention and Control of Soil Pollution in Jiangsu Province&quot;, which is implemented from September 1, 2022, stipulates that strict control of non-ferrous metal ore mining, non-ferrous metal smelting, oil开采、石油加工、化工、焦化、电镀、制革以及农药、铅蓄电池、钢铁、危险废物利用处置等行业中土壤污染严重的地块用途，不宜将其规划为居民区、学校、幼儿园、医院、 Land for nursing homes, nursing homes, etc. can be used to expand ecological space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Of course, even if unfortunately lived in a house built on soil pollution blocks, residents do not have to panic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Guo Lei said that if you live on the high floors, the distance is far from the surface. The concentration is also very low. The houses built above the &quot;toxic land&quot; are the most affected are the basement and garden and green belt. The volatile gas of pollutants will slowly penetrate into the underground space and accumulate here. It is not recommended to look forward to it in the basement, and the garden and green belt are easy to directly contact the soil. In the wind and dust weather, the residents should wear a mask. If protecting the protection, health risks can be greatly reduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 22 Nov 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[四川“废弃神话公园”，藏着“七仙女”与“历代帝王”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260960]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-22 13:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;November 9, 2023, the ancients with&quot; Huaxia History and Culture &quot;as the core theme In the world scenic spot, a number of emperors will be designed in the Huaxia process park. &quot;SRC =&quot; http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/eccbc4710d.jpg &quot;border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot;1080&quot; height = &quot;719&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/eccbc4710d.jpg&quot; data- &quot;258918&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>; November 9, 2023, the ancient famous world scenic area with &quot;Huaxia History and Culture&quot; as the core theme, designed in the Huaxia process garden Many emperors will be the statue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; It is not unusual, but the &quot;Ancient World&quot; tourist scenic spot located in Zhongjiang County, Deyang City, Sichuan Province, left a large number of full strokes after desertation abandonment.
