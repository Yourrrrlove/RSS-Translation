Compared with ordinary parks, children&#39;s parks have greater pressure on safety. A UNICEF survey of 35,000 children in 65 countries found that a quarter of children would feel unsafe in parks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Yafei works as an operations manager in Pingshan Children&#39;s Park, and has to &quot;fight&quot; with children climbing trees multiple times every day - there is a crooked tree next to the swing, which is the children&#39;s favorite. Preventing children from climbing trees has even become a key task for the park management staff. &quot;We will try to coax them a little at the beginning, and then we will be more stern. If it doesn&#39;t work, we will contact the parents.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Each project in Guangzhou Children&#39;s Park is equipped with staff. The number is slightly larger than that of other parks, with 60-70 people on duty every day. The park is also equipped with more than 40 emergency devices. Children can talk to the park alarm center by pressing a button. &quot;It is normal for children to get lost and look for their mother, 20 to 30 times a day.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To ensure safety, age or height restrictions on facilities are the most common methods. In Pingshan Children&#39;s Park, stainless steel slides and swings are suitable for those aged 4 and above, while more complex balance beams and climbing nets require those aged 6 and above 12 years old respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despite the regulations, it cannot stop children under age. In a net-climbing project, if you are not tall enough, it will be difficult to climb up to the last climbing point. There are often children who are half-climbed and their hands and feet are weak and dare not continue, so they have to be carried down by their parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/ziFDpqTKiUXj6dva8kdTe4msE9ocnzFWrypOyi3w.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/ziFDpqTKiUXj6dva8kdTe4msE9ocnzFWrypOyi3w.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252543&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The net-climbing slide in Pingshan Children&#39;s Park is difficult for children with insufficient physical strength and height to climb up. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Song Bingchen/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Children&#39;s parks will also receive contradictory complaints from parents. On the one hand, they want their children to play More facilities mean more experiences; on the other hand, there are worries about safety. This contradiction is also a question that Liu Yuelai, associate professor at the School of Architecture and Urban Planning of Tongji University, has been thinking about - should we just encircle the railings and make them the safest? He feels that how children overcome dangers and difficulties also needs to be taken into consideration. Child-friendliness is more important than caring for and taking responsibility for children, creating conditions for children to experience, practice and grow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, adults often prevent children from stepping into puddles. If all puddles are eliminated, children will be bored. If some difficulties are designed, children can realize that they can overcome them, which is &quot;more important than adults eliminating all dangers.&quot; While ensuring safety, the water depth, slope, etc. comply with national regulations, which can enrich the park&#39;s landforms and provide more fun for children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the research, Nan Yishan also found that when it comes to snakes, children and parents are not curious, but afraid: there are no snakes in the park, right? Therefore, the commentary they designed begins with a child&#39;s voice saying: &quot;Snakes and humans have very deep misunderstandings about each other. When humans see snakes, they are nervous and afraid; when snakes see humans, they are frightened and frightened.&quot; This popularization of science focuses on how to communicate with snakes. What to do if you get along and get bitten by a snake. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Let&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;children participate in the construction of the park&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Few people know that the Nanyue King Museum is the former site of the Guangzhou Children&#39;s Park. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guangzhou Children’s Park was first built in 1958. During the expansion in 1995, cultural relics of the Nanyue King were unearthed and moved to the junction of Renmin South Road and Yide Road not far away. Later, Guangzhou Baiyun Airport was moved and built in 2014. In 2006, it moved to the old Baiyun Airport land. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This &quot;Brief History of the Park&quot; inspired artist Chen Zhou. He taught at the Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts and later focused on children&#39;s nature education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guangzhou Children&#39;s Park has an &quot;Art in the Park&quot; planning project. The purpose is not to hold an Internet celebrity exhibition, but to present the original intention, concept, process and results of children&#39;s art production. Chen Zhou took the children to visit the Nanyue Palace, imagining what the palace looked like more than two thousand years ago, and let the children build the kingdom in their hearts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The children found that the passages of the Nanyue Palace resembled an underground maze, so they designed passages using environmentally friendly materials to imitate the maze. Some passages can only be entered by children. Who is the King of South Vietnam and what does he look like? They thought they were ducks and birds, so they painted these patterns on the palaces they made. Some patterns even had the style of ancient house tiles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With multiple express boxes connected in series, the children built a time and space maze that connects the history and present of the children&#39;s park - the &quot;Growing Palace&quot;. After the palace was on display, Chen Zhou often received WeChat friend requests. Later, he discovered that a child posted his WeChat QR code on the palace. &quot;It was a child&#39;s prank. Some parents also added me and told me that the child was real.&quot; I really like this work.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/EzScAI2eA58ShksvdvX8CIxhUaCXBnHPTHgSs73O.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/EzScAI2eA58ShksvdvX8CIxhUaCXBnHPTHgSs73O.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252538&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;After visiting the Nanyue Palace, the children designed their own &quot;Growing Palace&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Song Bingchen/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The children&#39;s art exhibition attracted many professional artists to visit, and some hope to participate next year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child divides children&#39;s rights into three categories, one of which is the right to participate. However, according to the aforementioned UNICEF survey, only 26% of children said that the local government heard their voices. Opinion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Children&#39;s parks have a similar dilemma. The stereotype of children&#39;s parks is that they are cartoony and colorful, even the bathrooms are colorful. Liu Yuelai has a different opinion. Sometimes there are colors everywhere, which is stimulating to children. Color is important, but the most important thing is the color of nature. &quot;For example, by observing how the colors of butterflies and sunflowers change, and immersing yourself in them, children will become more friendly to nature.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the construction of children&#39;s parks, children have a say and can even become the protagonists. Liu Yuelai found that children in fourth grade and above already have a very strong willingness to assert themselves and express themselves, and they have relatively strong spatial modeling abilities. In the process of participating in the construction of children&#39;s parks, children change from consumers to producers. “This kind of self-organization with order and endogenous dynamics is also an important experiment in civic education.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As users of children&#39;s parks, how children play game facilities determines the functions of the facilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The aerial net bed in Pingshan Children&#39;s Park was originally used for children and parents to sit and relax, but children prefer to use it as a trampoline. At first, park managers advised everyone not to jump, but many people wanted to jump. After consulting the equipment manufacturer, moderate jumping is allowed on the premise of controlling the age and number of children and ensuring safety. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/a4U7H4gQyVegtGpOVo45wGZUctJ1cmroXTCSVHJk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height= &quot;951&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/a4U7H4gQyVegtGpOVo45wGZUctJ1cmroXTCSVHJk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252535&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Under the big banyan tree in Guangzhou Children&#39;s Park, the artist led the children to weave a &quot;Klein cocoon&quot; imitating the &quot;Klein bottle&quot; for everyone to hide and seek in it. The children Not only are they the creators of &quot;Klein&#39;s Cocoon&quot;, but they are also users. These works remain permanently in the park and become amusement facilities for children. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Song Bingchen/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The park has become&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;a part of life&lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The city is so big, where is the best place to “walk your baby”? This question bothers parents. Behind the increased importance of children&#39;s parks is the reduction of children&#39;s activity space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Houses in big cities are getting smaller, and even living rooms are getting smaller. “People don’t have much need to entertain guests, and children have even less space at home, so they can only go outside to play. .&quot; Wang Yafei observed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before coming to Shenzhen Pingshan Children&#39;s Park to work as an operator, Wang Yafei had been working in operations and management in residential and commercial institutions. After arriving at the Children&#39;s Park, his mentality was &quot;much younger.&quot; &quot;Children talk lively and cutely, which makes people feel relaxed. After being together for a long time, they feel a little childish.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many residential areas around Pingshan Children&#39;s Park. Some children have become regular visitors to the park and come to play in the park almost every day after school. Over time, Wang Yafei and them have also become friends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/FH0H73nDVXyLBmzgeslarsG4DpJiHqSKuCy1VCn2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/FH0H73nDVXyLBmzgeslarsG4DpJiHqSKuCy1VCn2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252536&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Pingshan Children’s Park Children’s Bookstore. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Song Bingchen/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Children will inevitably get bumped when playing in the park, and band-aids are always available in children&#39;s parks. At first, a box of 100 band-aids was enough for a month, but later it became less and less. At the fastest, it could be used up in half a month. Wang Yafei accidentally discovered that many children took away three or four band-aids at one time. Even when they were injured at home, the first thing they thought of was: There are band-aids in the park, so they went to the park to get them. Children&#39;s parks have become part of their lives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Expanding the supply of public services for children&quot; is exactly the requirement of the &quot;Guiding Opinions on Promoting the Construction of Child-Friendly Cities&quot; issued by 23 departments including the National Development and Reform Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Liu Yuelai found that the &quot;appearances&quot; of children&#39;s parks are becoming more and more similar. &quot;It&#39;s a bit like houses built by developers. The apartments are all of the same type. The equipment used is nothing more than stainless steel, aluminum alloy or other durable plastics. There is no local expression.&quot; For example, park facilities in the northwest can have local characteristics and train children. The balanced tree stump does not need to purchase the same industrial products in the product catalog, but uses local elm trees, which can not only save costs, but also reflect the local culture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Shenzhen Design Code&quot; also mentioned that plants should reflect the characteristics of Shenzhen. No less than 70% of the plants should be produced within 500 kilometers of the park and should be selected from plants with low maintenance, strong weather resistance, and resistance to pests and diseases. There are few native tree species, and an appropriate amount of exotic landscape tree species adapted to Shenzhen’s climate are selected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tailored for children, it avoids &quot;competition&quot; for resources among different user groups. There are almost no other adults in the children&#39;s park except parents. Deng Xiaofei, a master&#39;s tutor at the School of Architecture and Urban Planning of Guangzhou University, believes that Guangzhou will build special children&#39;s parks in various districts with clear and professional functions, clear target service groups, and can better meet the needs of children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But &quot;small&quot; and &quot;far away&quot; are the feedback Wang Yafei hears most from parents. The first phase of Pingshan Children&#39;s Park covers an area of ​​57,000 square meters, which is equivalent to 8 football fields, but it is only larger than the required area for a comprehensive park. Half of it is bigger. The small area will naturally make parents feel that their children are not having enough fun - an hour&#39;s drive from Futian is not enough to play. Why not drive 20 minutes more to the larger Huizhou Daya Bay Children&#39;s Park? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if Guangzhou has the largest cluster of children&#39;s parks, it is still not dense enough. Deng Xiaofei has done research on the children&#39;s park system in Guangzhou. If they only travel for half an hour, only a few people will be able to access children&#39;s park resources. Only if they travel for one hour can children&#39;s park resources cover the vast majority of children in Guangzhou. This is inconsistent with There is still a gap in Guangzhou’s three-level child-friendly living circle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Guangzhou Planning Guidelines for Building a Child-Friendly City&quot; proposes to build a child-friendly living circle that can reach the entire area within 30 minutes by public transportation; relying on streets and residential areas, build a child-friendly life that can be reached at street level within 15 minutes&#39; walk. circle; relying on residential communities, we will build a child-friendly living circle that can be reached within a 5-minute walk at the community level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deng Xiaofei suggested that Guangzhou could increase the number and area of ​​children&#39;s parks in densely populated old urban areas and northern fringe urban areas. For old cities with a shortage of space, you can consider using idle or inefficient land resources, such as abandoned factories, to rebuild or expand the original children&#39;s parks, and set up children&#39;s play facilities in existing parks, squares, streets and other public spaces. , create children’s activity venues, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first batch of Guangzhou&#39;s child-friendly series pilot lists released in August 2023, in addition to children&#39;s special parks, Liuhua Lake Park, Yuexiu Park, etc. were also selected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shenzhen also has similar ideas. The &quot;Shenzhen Action Plan for Building a Child-Friendly City (2021-2025)&quot; proposes to build more community parks and small-scale amusement parks, and expand sufficient children&#39;s game venues in city parks and community parks. By 2025, more than 100 child-friendly parks will be built. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 09:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[高标准对接国际经贸规则，“应聚焦数字经济领域的制度型开放”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257748]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-28 08:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/27/eOTBZFyizbruWq2svzV7bbVkt4RNFmNubK6t2GGa.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/eOTBZFyizbruWq2svzV7bbVkt4RNFmNubK6 t2GGa. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252344&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Shanghai Yangshan Deep Water Port is also an important part of the free trade zone. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The top priority this year is to align with international high-standard economic and trade rules and promote high-level and comprehensive Institutional opening.

The introduction of &quot;Several Measures&quot; marks the beginning of my country&#39;s formal alignment with international high-standard rules such as CPTPP and DEPA in terms of substantive content. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The thirty-three articles of &quot;Several Measures&quot; are mainly based on the CPTPP rules. Some provisions are also reflected in the content of DEPA, such as DEPA Article 2.6 for six-hour customs clearance of express cargo, etc. Trade facilitation measures. This shows that the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone has relatively mature conditions to apply these rules. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is reported that in practice, Shanghai has been at the forefront of the country in terms of facilitation of trade in goods. Recently, Shanghai has also highlighted this in the implementation plan for the implementation of &quot;Several Measures&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You once mentioned that compared with international high standards such as CPTPP and DEPA According to the rules, there is still room for further expansion in the scope of the digital economy content in the &quot;Several Measures&quot;. How should we understand it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Pendre: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There are two rules related to digital trade in the &quot;Several Measures&quot;, one is about online consumer protection, and the second is about Software source code disclosure issues. However, CPTPP Chapter 14 E-Commerce (Digital Trade) covers 18 items, and each item also contains different amounts. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, &quot;non-discriminatory treatment of digital products&quot;, that is, any Party grants digital products created, produced, published, contracted, represented or first commercialized in the territory of another Party. Treatment of products, or treatment of digital products whose authors, performers, producers, developers or owners are persons of another Party, shall not be less favorable than the treatment it accords to other similar digital products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For another example, there is a rule in the CPTPP regarding the &quot;location of computer facilities&quot;: No Party shall require a covered person to use or set up computing facilities in the territory of that Party as part of carrying out activities in its territory. Conditions of business. Each party will also consider the issue of data security, so the CPTPP adds an exception to this rule, that is, nothing in this article shall prevent a party from achieving legitimate public policy objectives, which leaves a certain amount of time for each party to policy space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the premise of protecting national security, more systematic considerations are needed on how to further align with international high-standard rules on non-discriminatory treatment of digital products and the location of computer facilities in the future. These provisions are also key provisions in DEPA, and they have an important impact on digital economic activities such as digital trade. Of course, this also provides space for the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone to be implemented first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone is in line with international high standards in the field of digital economy , what are the advantages? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Peng Delei:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Compared with other domestic free trade pilot zones, at present, the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone mainly undertakes the function of institutional innovation.

Taking CPTPP as an example, it covers 30 chapters including investment, e-commerce, and environment. If the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone wants to benchmark every chapter at this stage, I think it will be difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the conditions of the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone, it is more advantageous to actively benchmark DEPA and focus on institutional opening up in the field of digital economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the industrial foundation for the development of digital trade in the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone is unmatched by other pilot free trade zones. Shanghai is an international economic center, financial center, trade center, shipping center and technological innovation center. Trade The foundation is mature, and the newly established Lingang New Area in 2019 is also actively exploring the construction of an international data port. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, Article 84 of the newly revised &quot;Legislative Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; stipulates that &quot;the Shanghai Municipal People&#39;s Congress and its Standing Committee shall, in accordance with the authorized decision of the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress, formulate the Pudong New Area &quot;Regulations, implemented in Pudong New Area&quot;, which also provides a legal basis and guarantee for the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone to carry out pilot trials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone should promote China’s accession in the field of digital economy High-standard economic and trade agreements provide practical support.

The extent to which the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone has adapted to DEPA and the problems it has encountered can provide an experience reference for China in subsequent negotiations to join DEPA. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone is still in the exploratory stage in the process of connecting with CPTPP and DEPA. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, in terms of cross-border data flow, national security must be taken into consideration, and risk assessment and prevention and control must be done when aligning with international high-standard rules. What risks are faced by the free flow of data, how big the risks are, and what impacts they will bring, definitely require more detailed and systematic consideration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can break through from two entry points and gradually expand the scope of docking. First, we can consider learning from the negative list approach and research and develop an important data catalog. If this type of data is in the directory, the management specifications need to be stricter; otherwise, they can be relatively loose. Secondly, some qualified companies can also be allowed to pilot cross-border data flows. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“We attach great importance to the construction of a digital trust environment”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics , Italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Since the establishment of the Lingang New Area, some explorations have been completed in promoting institutional opening up in digital trade. What are the highlights? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Peng Delei:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;First of all, the &quot;About Supporting Lingang New Films&quot; issued by the Lingang New Area Management Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Commerce Commission on August 30 Implementation Plan for the District to Deepen High-level Institutional Opening and Promote Innovative Development of Trade in Services (hereinafter referred to as the “Implementation Plan”). This is a comprehensive plan for the development of service trade in the Lingang New Area and has breakthrough significance. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, the &quot;Implementation Plan&quot; proposes specific measures for the safe and orderly flow of data and the innovative development of digital trade. For example, a data supervision sandbox pilot was launched to promote the implementation of a number of cross-border data cooperation projects such as electronic invoices and digital identities. The data supervision sandbox is equivalent to piloting some supervision measures on a certain subject in a region, and then judging whether it is suitable for promotion based on feasibility and effect. The implementation of electronic invoices and digital identities can improve trade efficiency and reduce business operating costs. These measures are actually the content of DEPA and are also the specific actions for Lingang New Area to align with international high-standard rules. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Lingang New Area is also relatively advanced in the construction of digital infrastructure, such as the layout and construction of international communication submarine cable facilities, as well as the new National (Shanghai) Internet Exchange Center and international Internet dedicated channels. Construction etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the field of digital trade, Lingang New Area can take the lead in the future What international high-standard economic and trade rules should we try? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Pendre: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In terms of benchmarking DEPA, there are two aspects that can be tried first. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, strengthen cooperation among digital enterprises. DEPA’s chapter on “Cooperation with SMEs” mentions that “Parties shall engage in digital SME dialogue. The dialogue may include the private sector, non-governmental organizations, academic experts and other stakeholders from each Party”. It is recommended to establish cooperative organizations or conduct regular forums to promote exchanges between small and medium-sized enterprises and Chinese and foreign-funded enterprises, and the demands of foreign-invested enterprises in China can also be reflected through this mechanism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regarding the cross-border data flow issues that digital investors are concerned about, on the premise of ensuring national security, it can also solve the worries of foreign investors investing in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is to strengthen mutual recognition of digital enterprises. Article 4.2 of DEPA states that “Parties shall endeavor to mutually recognize the data protection trust marks of other Parties as an effective mechanism to facilitate cross-border information transfers while protecting personal information.” After mutual recognition of information and security is completed, if both parties need to conduct data flow or transactions, many procedural requirements can be reduced and costs can be saved, which is equivalent to establishing a white list for each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, Chinese-funded companies have previously been awarded the Data Protection Trust Mark (DPTM) by the Singapore Infocomm Media Development Authority. It is used to certify businesses that have deployed data protection measures to demonstrate that their operations comply with Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act. Similarly, Article 12 of my country’s Personal Information Protection Law also contains relevant statements, which is to promote international exchanges and cooperation in personal information protection and promote mutual recognition of personal information protection rules and standards with other countries, regions, and international organizations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The cross-border flow of data is considered a basic prerequisite for digital trade. What is the current practice in this regard in the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Peng Delei:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The cross-border flow of data in the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone is generally governed by the Data Security Law, National Security Law and Personal Information Protection Law. operating within the framework. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I communicate with the practical community, I feel that they attach great importance to the construction of a digital trust environment. The digital trust environment includes network security, personal privacy protection, etc. For example, in the process of digital trade, it is necessary to ensure that large-scale data leaks or cyber attacks cannot occur. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shanghai has made a lot of efforts in developing digital trade. For example, the &quot;Implementation Plan&quot; mentioned that the Lingang New Area will build the country&#39;s first digital trust pilot zone. In addition, in July this year, the Standing Committee of the 16th Shanghai Municipal People&#39;s Congress publicly released the full text of &quot;Shanghai Provisions on Promoting Data Circulation and Transactions in Pudong New Area (Draft)&quot; to solicit opinions from the society. The overall context and value concept of this consultation draft is to strengthen the use of data. In the past, many policies emphasized the protection of data. If data can be fully utilized, it will help promote the development of the data economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Business environment assessment indicators benchmark against international standards&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics , Italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the past ten years, the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone has been piloted and has achieved many results. In your opinion, what is the most important outcome? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Pendre: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think the most important thing is to implement the “pre-establishment national treatment plus negative list management system” for foreign investment. This concept was proposed with a certain background, mainly based on some demands and paradigms put forward by the United States on investment access during the bilateral investment negotiations between China and the United States at that time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But at first, we didn’t know whether these two systems could be implemented, so we first tried them in the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone. In 2013, the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone piloted the first negative list for foreign investment access. Years of trying have since provided many helpful experiences. Therefore, by the promulgation of the Foreign Investment Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China in 2019, the &quot;pre-establishment national treatment plus negative list management system&quot; was officially written into law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These two systems have been implemented from pilot to legal form and implemented nationwide, achieving the effect that the experience of the Pilot Free Trade Zone can be replicated and promoted, reflecting the pioneering spirit of the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone. mission to try. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Free Trade Pilot Zone Key Work List (2023)&quot; issued by the Ministry of Commerce -2025), specifically requires the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone to strive to create a world-class business environment. What can be done in this regard? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Peng Delei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone attaches great importance to the construction of business environment. For example, the Lingang New Area is actively benchmarking against the World Bank&#39;s newly released business environment project concept document in May this year, namely the B-READY project. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As far as I know, Lingang New Area invites accounting firms to conduct business environment assessments every year. Not long ago, my colleagues and I went to Lingang New Area to participate in a seminar on the business environment. We talked about the three chapters of B-READY: dispute resolution, bankruptcy and labor. For example, online arbitration can be used Facilitate and improve the business environment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that the new version of the World Bank’s business environment assessment indicators includes content related to digital trade, that is, the digital trade restrictions index. In the future, China may also include restrictions on digital trade as part of its business environment assessment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;2023 is the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone.

Currently, it is mainly based on DEPA and CPTPP; second, it is necessary to improve the level of market access, focusing on increasing investment and service trade.

This area is home to many automobile manufacturing and parts companies. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of this century, Jinqiao, as the first national export processing zone, attracted Volvo to open an assembly plant here. By 2012, Volvo Construction Equipment signed a memorandum of understanding with the Shanghai Municipal Government to establish its regional headquarters in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the office, Zhan Xu, director of Volvo Construction Equipment, recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that for the company at that time, it was like a young man starting to make life plans. He had many ideas, but met a bottleneck. &quot;The place where I live is an electronics factory, can I only be a factory boy and factory girl for the rest of my life?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhan Xu described that the establishment of the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone solved the hesitation of &quot;this young man&quot;, &quot;It tells all companies what Pudong, Shanghai and even China will develop into.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2015, the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone was expanded to include the Lujiazui Financial Area, Jinqiao Development Area, and Zhangjiang High-tech Area, in addition to the four special customs supervision areas including the Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone. In August 2019, the country&#39;s only new free trade pilot zone was unveiled in the Lingang area of ​​Shanghai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;September 29, 2023 is the tenth anniversary of the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone. Over the past ten years, the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone has been a pioneer in testing systems and exploring new paths for the country, and has also become an important driving force for Shanghai&#39;s economic development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;White Paper on the 10th Anniversary of the Construction of the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone&quot;, as of the end of 2022, Pudong New Area has established a total of 18,691 new foreign-invested projects, with a cumulative registered foreign capital of US$217.274 billion, and a cumulative paid-in foreign capital of US$74.994 One hundred million U.S. dollars. Pudong New Area will achieve a regional GDP of 1.6 trillion yuan in 2022, creating 1/74 of the GDP with an area of ​​1/8000 of the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Entering a new stage, the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone is facing new expectations. The report of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed to &quot;implement the strategy of improving the free trade pilot zone.&quot; At the same time, China is applying to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Xinhua News Agency on September 26, 2023, Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, President of the State, and Chairman of the Central Military Commission, recently issued important instructions on further promoting the construction of the free trade pilot zone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xi Jinping emphasized that on the new journey, based on a comprehensive summary of ten years of construction experience, we must deeply implement the free trade pilot zone improvement strategy, bravely be a pioneer in forging ahead and overcoming difficulties, and work in a wider field and Carry out deeper exploration and strive to build a higher-level free trade pilot zone. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Responsive to all requests, no disturbance&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“If there is no free trade pilot zone Without support, a lot of business may be done overseas. With the establishment of the pilot free trade zone, we have one more way to go. Since the pilot free trade zone wants to engage in innovation, companies will feel that they might as well come to the government to talk.&quot; Zhan Xu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2018, Volvo Construction Equipment became the first company in the Pilot Free Trade Zone to realize cross-border settlement of offshore trade. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A reporter from Southern Weekend learned from the Jinqiao Management Committee that at that time the customer ordered two sets of engineering equipment produced in South Korea from Volvo Construction Equipment. The transaction and transportation occurred overseas, and the fund settlement (receipt from overseas customers, The two processes of payment to Korean factories) are carried out in the free trade pilot zone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his early years, Zhan Xu ran through industrial and commercial windows and dealt with the government for a long time. &quot;In the past, we participated in policy briefings, but now we attend more research meetings. Many ideas for institutional innovation in the free trade pilot zone came from the enterprise side.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said that in the past, enterprises went to The government mostly consults on policies. Now when companies encounter problems, the government helps bring relevant people over and everyone sits down to discuss solutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Talking about the changes brought about by the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone, Zhan Xu spoke highly of the reform of the commercial system. &quot;All the approval procedures have been simplified. One trip is required for each matter, and sometimes there is no need to make a trip at all. This not only saves manpower and costs for the company, but also plays a great role in stimulating corporate vitality and improving corporate confidence.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;According to a press conference held by the Shanghai Municipal Government on September 15, 2023, in the past ten years, the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone has deepened the reform of the commercial system around the entire life cycle of enterprises and innovatively carried out &quot;separation of licenses and licenses&quot; and &quot;post-licensing&quot; Pilot projects such as &quot;license reduction&quot; and &quot;one industry, one license&quot; have issued more than 5,000 comprehensive industry licenses in 31 industries. The average approval time has been reduced by nearly 90%, application materials have been reduced by nearly 70%, and form-filling elements have been reduced by more than 60%. %. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone has also taken the lead in implementing the registered capital subscription system, the business entity registration confirmation system, the market quasi-operation commitment immediate entry system, innovating business entity exit mechanisms such as simple cancellation, and continuously reducing institutional transaction cost. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We respond to requests and don’t disturb anything.” Wu Haixia, CEO of Xingbei Group, expressed similar feelings to Zhan Xu when recalling the company’s process of building Shanghai Free Trade No. 1 Life Technology Industrial Park. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Haixia told Southern Weekend reporters that when the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone was officially launched, the company had just arrived at the Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone to acquire the land. As the first biomedical entrepreneurial park in the Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone, we will encounter many new situations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Free Trade No. 1 currently plans to build three phases of the park. About 150 companies have settled in the first and second phases of the park. Wu Haixia said that biopharmaceutical companies have different building height requirements from other companies. With the help of the management committee, the maximum floor height of the first-phase park was only 24 meters, and by the third-phase park, it can reach 50 meters. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, at that time, the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone implemented a comprehensive land use reform pilot in the Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone. This reform is also very attractive to the biomedical industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Several Opinions on Comprehensive Land Use Planning and Land Management in the Bonded Area of ​​the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone&quot; that came into effect on November 20, 2016 (valid until November 19, 2021), encourages The land uses are compatible, and the land use types are mixed with two or more uses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Several Opinions&quot; stated that factors such as spatial layout, industrial integration, building compatibility and traffic environment should be comprehensively considered, and functional guidance requirements for comprehensive land use in the bonded area of ​​the free trade pilot zone should be put forward, and the planning of mixed comprehensive land use should be clarified Type of use, proportion, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The land used by biopharmaceutical companies is generally based on the ratio of 1/3 office, 1/3 R&amp;D, and 1/3 production. But strictly speaking, office and R&amp;D cannot be located on industrial land. .With comprehensive land use reform, it can better meet the needs of the biomedical industry.&quot; Wu Haixia said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;System innovation can reduce costs for enterprises&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Zhan Xu has been in foreign-funded enterprises for 27 years. In his view, whether a multinational company chooses to stay in one place for development depends on whether it can do more business and whether the market is good; second, whether there are risks in operation and whether the rules are clear; third, whether there is any institutional innovation. , which is an important factor in promoting high-quality development of enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned from the above-mentioned press conference that of the 302 free trade pilot zone system innovations replicated and promoted at the national level, nearly half were originated from Shanghai or were simultaneously piloted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shanghai Hongming Supply Chain Co., Ltd. is an enterprise established nearly 30 years ago. Since 2006, it has gradually transformed from a traditional logistics enterprise into a digital supply chain enterprise, currently mainly engaged in integrated circuits, medical equipment and other industries. Provide supply chain services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you walk into Hongming&#39;s office at No. 899 Dangui Road, Pudong New Area, you can see two rows of unmanned workstations. Intelligent robots are completing actions such as identifying and entering waybills and automatically filing customs declarations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the adjacent office, Bai Li, senior manager of Hongming Customs Management Department, told Southern Weekend reporters that the company&#39;s transformation has benefited from many innovative measures in the customs supervision system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Baili gave an example. A domestic factory purchased a piece of equipment from abroad. When a screen of the piece of equipment failed, the past practice was for the factory to place an order overseas and go through customs clearance, tax payment, and international transportation. Waiting for the process, it may take a week for the new screen to arrive at the factory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In a mature manufacturing process, the assembly line machines are lined up one after another. If this one breaks, all the others behind it will be broken.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Started in 2006 , Hongming has opened bonded warehouses in areas such as Waigaoqiao, which is equivalent to putting this screen at the &quot;doorstep&quot;, saving the time and cost incurred by the original &quot;ordering from overseas&quot; model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But as the size of transactions increases, companies need a more cost-effective approach. &quot;In order to serve factories in ten places across the country, a company needs to put 10 screens, which incurs the cost of 10 screens. So, can it only put 5 screens?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone Launched The special customs supervision model for the circulation of bonded goods between regions has solved the most troublesome problem of the national circulation of bonded goods in the industrial supply chain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Now bonded goods between free trade pilot zones can flow quickly and freely, and the data and information flow sent by enterprises are sent to the regulatory authorities, replacing the traditional paper documents between the regulatory authorities of the two places. Circulation.&quot; Bai Li said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hongming has established 24 industrial supply chain logistics centers in 14 cities across the country. This model now covers all its logistics centers, effectively reducing inventory costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned press conference introduced that the institutional innovation achievements of the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone and the Lingang New Area are mainly reflected in four aspects: focusing on the supply of innovative institutions required for industrial development and enhancing new driving forces for high-quality development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, in the biopharmaceutical industry, the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone took the lead in piloting the medical device marketing authorization holder system (MAH) in December 2017. Eligible medical device registration applications in the Pilot Free Trade Zone People can apply for a medical device registration certificate individually and then entrust production to an enterprise with qualifications and production capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Free Trade No. 1 is the first biopharmaceutical business park in China that meets MAH requirements. Wu Haixia said that Free Trade One has built the country&#39;s first CDMO platform with industrial park attributes and built 6 production lines. The CDMO platform can provide enterprises with services in research and development, small trials, pilot trials, animal experiments, human trials, registration and approval and other processes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Haixia said that generally speaking, the investment in a production line is more than 10 million yuan. In the past, companies had to wait about 2 years from application to finally getting the certificate, during which the production lines were idle. The economic investment of the enterprise has not been maximized and time has been wasted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He introduced that under the MAH system, companies can share production lines, &quot;which can reduce costs, improve utilization, and release huge dividends.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;July 5, 2018, Shanghai The Food and Drug Administration issued an announcement &quot;Expanding the pilot reform of the city&#39;s medical device registrant system to the entire city.&quot; Starting from June 1, 2021, the revised &quot;Regulations on the Supervision and Administration of Medical Devices&quot; will be officially implemented, and the medical device registrant system will be fully implemented across the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Haixia also suggested that the whitelist system for biomedical research and development supplies and special imported items should be further promoted and improved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said that as &quot;raw materials&quot; for biomedical research and development, special items such as microorganisms, human tissues, biological products, blood and their products have been planned to be imported in recent years with the development of the industry. However, special items may carry risks of various infectious diseases, and Shanghai Port is extremely cautious about related imports and exports. The rapid development of the biomedical industry has put forward higher demands for rapid customs clearance of special items. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relevant systems will be gradually implemented in Shanghai starting from 2020, but there are still few open parts. It is hoped that the free trade zone can accelerate the implementation of this system. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Make full use of the legislative power of Pudong New Area&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Compared with other free trade pilot zones, the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone was established the earliest, and Pudong The new district has the unique advantage of “legislative power”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 10, 2021, the 29th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 13th National People&#39;s Congress voted and adopted the &quot;Decision on Authorizing the Shanghai Municipal People&#39;s Congress and its Standing Committee to formulate regulations for the Pudong New Area&quot;. Authorize the Shanghai Municipal People&#39;s Congress and its Standing Committee to formulate Pudong New Area regulations based on the practical needs of Pudong&#39;s reform and innovation, in compliance with the provisions of the Constitution and basic legal and administrative rules, and implement them in Pudong New Area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This unique advantage played an important role when Hongming participated in an institutional innovation in the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, Hongming and the Pudong Integrated Circuit Industry Association reported that the company&#39;s application for exemption from compulsory product certification (i.e. &quot;CCC exemption&quot;) took a long time, resulting in the failure of equipment parts to be delivered to semiconductors in time. Problems with the production plant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem Hongming encountered at that time was that the normal CCC exemption required about 2 working days to be issued, but the supply chain after-sales maintenance service needed to be provided 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The support of the original policy was not enough It can no longer meet industrial needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bai Li raised a pen and made several gestures on the table. &quot;For example, a fuse is very small, but once it blows, the entire machine stops.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, traditional CCC exemptions are for upstream and downstream enterprises in the industry, and the supply chain companies themselves do not have development applications. permissions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Baili believes that supply chain companies as chain owners are not only familiar with goods and products, but also have the clearest understanding of the flow of the entire supply chain. If the main unit of the innovation chain can apply, the supervision will be upgraded from point supervision to chain supervision, and the entire flow of goods will be clearly visible where it comes from and where it goes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the promotion of Pudong Market Supervision and Administration Bureau, Hongming took the lead in piloting the convenient channel for CCC exemption. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main contents of the pilot include allowing rapid certification through &quot;self-declaration, automatic certification, and integrity supervision&quot;; through process reengineering, the 5-working-day manual approval will be transformed into a &quot;zero-wait&quot; automatic system Release. At the same time, the restriction that logistics trading enterprises cannot be the subject of CCC exemption applications has been broken, expanding the scope of CCC exemption subjects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 2020 to 2022, Hongming and regulatory authorities will continue to improve processes and systems. &quot;By 2023, companies and associations feel that they can combine the legislative power of Pudong New Area to fix the pilot policies and promote them.&quot; Bai Li said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 1, 2023, the country&#39;s first CCC exemption management measure &quot;Several Provisions on Exemption from Compulsory Product Certification in Pudong New Area, Shanghai&quot; was officially implemented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Pudong Market Supervision Bureau described that one of the main innovations in the management measures is that according to relevant regulations, logistics trading companies cannot be the applicant for CCC exemption. With the approval and authorization from the General Administration of Pudong, supply chain enterprises that clearly provide services to key industries can be applicants for CCC exemption. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the fourth meeting of the Standing Committee of the 16th Shanghai Municipal People’s Congress held on July 24, 2023, the Municipal Development and Reform Commission mentioned that it would take the opportunity to make full use of the Pudong New Area’s legislative power to base itself on its own Based on the practical needs of reform and innovation in the Pilot Trade Zone and Lingang New Area, we will study and formulate a number of policies and measures in terms of strengthening the innovation engine, high-level institutional opening, reform system integration, and urban governance modernization. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Innovative intellectual property protection&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Promoting institutional innovation in the field of intellectual property is also the first step for the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone to align with international high-standard economic and trade rules such as CPTPP and DEPA. important aspects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the 10th anniversary press conference of the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone held by the Shanghai Municipal Government on September 15, Shen Weihua, deputy director of the Municipal Commerce Commission, said that the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone is under the guidance of the Ministry of Commerce and other national ministries and commissions. and support, focus on the provisions of post-border management systems such as trade in goods, trade in services, digital trade, intellectual property rights, and government procurement in CPTPP and DEPA, and study reform measures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Chao, Executive Deputy Director of Pudong New Area, introduced at the press conference that in the 10 years since the construction of the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone, a high-level intellectual property protection system has been improved, including the implementation of rapid patent pre-examination, patent implementation investigation, etc. &quot; &quot;Quick Protection&quot; system, shortening the invention patent authorization cycle from 3 years to 3 months, exploring the implementation of a punitive compensation system for intellectual property infringement, and taking the lead in building an international intellectual property protection highland. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2021, the Shanghai Lingang New Area Intellectual Property Rights Protection Mutual Aid Fund was launched. This is the country’s first market-oriented intellectual property rights protection mutual aid fund. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, the Lingang Market Supervision Bureau took the lead in establishing the non-profit social organization &quot;Lingang New Area Intellectual Property Exchange Promotion Center&quot; and used the center as a platform to operate funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Zhenhua, director of the Lingang New Area Intellectual Property Exchange and Promotion Center, told Southern Weekend reporters that the fund was launched in the Lingang New Area mainly because the new area has institutional innovation soil, coupled with the agglomeration of cutting-edge technologies and key industries. There is a need for intellectual property protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He pointed out that with the deepening of the participation of enterprises in the new area in international economic and trade, the international competition for intellectual property rights they face has become increasingly fierce. Many enterprises are struggling in international competition due to their weak foundation in talents, funds, information, etc. are often at a disadvantage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“In this context, the implementation of the fund has improved the diversified intellectual property rights protection system in the Lingang New Area, and will help form a long-term market-oriented operation rights protection and mutual assistance mechanism in the Lingang New Area, providing industry Innovation and development will be escorted.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, there are nearly 180 members of the fund, covering key industrial areas in the Lingang New Area, with a capital scale of nearly 1.3 million. A fund expansion plan was launched in 2022 and will be managed in accordance with the annual fee management regulations of the Board of Directors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The center introduced that the so-called marketization means that under the guidance of the government, enterprises insist on &quot;self-organization, independent management, and autonomous operation.&quot; Fund raising, management, and use are all solved through market-oriented mechanisms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the first of its kind in the country, the fund has no mature experience to draw from. Feng Zhenhua said that this cycle of encountering problems, investigating and researching, and solving problems has been accompanying the entire process of fund establishment and operation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The real needs of enterprises in the Lingang New Area have become the most important criterion for the establishment of the fund.” The center said that after intensive research on nearly 50 enterprises, the preparatory team determined the conditions for the establishment and operation of the fund. The basic idea is to &quot;combine public welfare with marketization, link intellectual property rights with key industries, and balance system construction with dispute response.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since its establishment, the fund has helped enterprises in Lingang New Area successfully deal with intellectual property disputes and provided financial support for rights protection in 2 cases, and intervened in intellectual property disputes in advance to provide consultation more than 15 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A company engaged in the R&amp;D and production of innovative medical devices in Lingang New Area encountered a patent attack from global medical device industry giants during its listing process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The center introduced that in addition to the active response of enterprises themselves, the fund has played an important role in rights protection assistance, coordinating multi-party expert think tank resources to provide dispute response guidance, providing rights protection financial support, and also providing companies with intellectual property rights.咨询，帮助其进一步完善知识产权布局，降低经营风险，最终在专利无效案中胜诉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在冯振华看来，未来自贸试验区在知识产权方面还可以关注以下问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一是让企业了解国际经贸规则，提前做好准备以便应对潜在的知识产权风险；二是主动融入国际高标准经贸规则体系，甚至通过先试先行探索经验来影响经贸规则；三是平衡中国技术创新和产业发展与国际规则中知识产权相关规定适用的关系；四是关注新技术、新业态为知识产权相关规则适用带来的挑战。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;大胆试、大胆闯、自主改&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2023年9月18日，南方周末记者在沃尔沃建筑设备的仓库里看到一台大型的绿色的再制造发动机。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在场的工作人员介绍，这台发动机是全国首单“重点行业再制造产品进口试点”货物，是公司向瑞典订购的，于9月1日抵达仓库，后续将交付客户用于售后。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据“浦东发布”，为了让货物快速到达工厂，浦东海关提供了门到门查检服务。现场查检主要是确保单货相符，以及进口机器设备的相关参数、性能等是否与申报内容相符，确保商品既通得快、走得顺，又管得住。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在此之前，中国在政策层面对进口再制造产品按照旧机电产品进行管理。 “如一缔约方采取或维持措施禁止或限制旧货的进口，则该缔约方不得将这些措施适用于再制造货物。”詹旭现场念了一段CPTPP关于再制造产品的内容。他表示，从国际规则来看，再制造产品是允许进口的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;6月1日，国务院印发《关于在有条件的自由贸易试验区和自由贸易港试点对接国际高标准推进制度型开放的若干措施》，第一条就是“支持试点地区开展重点行业再制造产品进口试点”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在詹旭看来，这次针对再制造产品的制度创新产生了多赢的结果。企业拓宽了业务空间，自贸区增加了贸易种类，同时与国际高标准规则接轨。此外，对打通国内国际双循环，达成低碳减排目标等也有重要意义。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据“浦东发布”，为了保障首单试点进口货物顺利通关，上海海关提前介入，全程参与，研究制定了专项监管方案和应急预案。由企业所属地浦东海关负责联系企业，做好企业的事前指导、再制造产品的通关监管等工作，通过专窗受理申报、“门到门”查检等服务措施，确保重点行业再制造产品进口高效、安全通关。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“为什么叫做制度创新？因为这个改变不是领导批个条子，而是要讲出个所以然，要大家坐下来研究。”詹旭说，改变这条规则涉及哪些部门、各自要做出怎样的变化、规则改变后的监管和推广要怎么处理等问题都要研究清楚。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;十年来，詹旭对自贸区的理解也在发生变化。他最初觉得，自贸试验区是在上海出台税收优惠等方面的政策。过了一段时间，他开始理解，设立自贸试验区不是在一个地方搞特殊化，而是针对一些特殊的问题进行试点，然后全面铺开。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“其实原来没想到那么宏大的层面。过去觉得，自贸试验区是不是在解决招商引资的问题？后来我慢慢体会到，自贸试验区是要对接国际标准，把解决方案放在国际视野去综合考虑。”他说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“浦东发布”介绍，上海自贸试验区提早谋划落实上述《若干措施》试点任务，目前已取得了积极进展，初步形成了一批制度创新成果。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了率先开展再制造产品进口试点，成果还包括持续优化金融创新业务审批服务，瑞士再保险集团子公司瑞再企商保险申请增资支持个人保险业务拓展，10日内即获批准等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年3月30日，上海市委副书记、市长龚正在中国（上海）自由贸易试验区推进工作领导小组会议上说，“十年来，上海自贸试验区大胆试、大胆闯、自主改，充分发挥了开路先锋、示范引领、突破攻坚的作用，彰显了全市经济增长极和发动机作用。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“接下来，要更好发挥高水平改革开放&#39;试验田&#39;作用，在制度创新上取得更大突破。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[杭州亚运会：赛场内外，同样精彩]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257774]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;截至2023年9月27日17时，中国代表团在杭州亚运会奖牌榜上遥遥领先，奖牌总数124块，其中69块金牌、39块银牌、16块铜牌。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;购买森林碳抵消曾经是企业实现碳中和目标的“快车道”，但最近不少企业宣布放弃这条途径，更关注自身的碳减排。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（农健/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“森林已经不再是人类减碳的朋友了”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年9月初，美国著名的气候报道记者大卫·华莱士·威尔斯在一篇有关森林山火的评论文章里哀叹。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;今夏肆虐加拿大全境的山火，烧掉的不只是森林，还有它们背后的森林碳抵消项目。伴着浓浓黑烟，通过光合作用汇集的碳被释放，森林变成了巨大碳源。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;森林碳抵消项目是重要的碳信用，通过购买碳信用来抵消自身的碳排放，曾经是企业实现碳中和目标的“快车道”，尤其受到“减排困难户”如石油业、航空业等青睐。然而这几年，碳抵消项目特别是林业碳抵消项目受到越来越多的质疑甚至“漂绿”指责。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年9月，国际石油公司壳牌宣布放弃其每年投入1亿美元的碳抵消计划，因为当前的“碳抵消”项目，没能达到公司的质量标准。彭博新能源财经在其《长期碳抵消展望》报告中指出，由于担心购买到低质量的碳信用而遭遇声誉风险，2022年在全球范围内，企业碳抵消的额度比2021年下降了4%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为什么森林碳抵消项目越来越不受欢迎了？ &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;二氧化碳并不是“一等一”互换关系&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;质疑的根本原因在于森林“减排原理”的局限性。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;林业碳汇吸收的二氧化碳和化石燃料燃烧排放到大气中的二氧化碳并不是“一等一”互换的关系。政府间气候变化专门委员会（IPCC）特别区分了两种“碳循环”模式：长碳循环（或称慢速碳循环）和短碳循环（或者快速碳循环）。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;长碳循环的碳主要储存在岩石圈，也就是经由千万年被固定下来的化石燃料中。这部分碳如果不被开采燃烧，一般情况下不参与大气中的碳循环，因为将碳化合物储存在地下的过程缓慢，“长碳循环”可能需要数千年到数万年才能完成一个循环。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;短碳循环的碳储存在植被和土壤里，碳的循环利用期短，时间取决于植物的寿命，一般在100年内：植物光合作用吸收二氧化碳——植物死亡或被动物、真菌或微生物分解——碳回到大气。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;自然界中“短碳循环”和“长碳循环”少有交集，并不交叉。使用“植树吸碳”来吸收经由化石燃料开采和燃烧所释放的碳，则是人为地在两种系统间进行了等量替换，并不符合数学逻辑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;植树吸碳的原理就是光合作用，但值得注意的是，只有处于生长阶段的森林才有较强的吸碳能力，树木逐步成长为老龄树后，代谢慢甚至枯死，将不再适用于碳汇项目。因此，一般造林碳汇项目的周期是20-60年。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，这期间的碳汇也不稳定。在树木生长期，森林可能会因病虫害、火灾或采伐等原因而受损甚至死亡，森林就会由“碳汇”转变为“碳源”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最为突出的是山火问题。自2015年以来，美国加州的山火已经破坏了6个森林碳抵消项目，将570万至680万吨的二氧化碳重新排回大气。在2021年的大火中，微软和英国石油公司购买的森林抵消项目也被烧毁，给公司的“气候表现”带来了不少压力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年，一篇发表在《自然》杂志上的研究结果甚至显示，在采伐和森林火灾的双重影响下，亚马孙东南部的热带雨林已经成为碳源，不再是碳汇。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在全球变暖背景下，林业碳汇项目的山火风险进一步增加。 WRI的分析显示，过去20年间，全球森林的失火率几乎翻了一番。联合国环境规划署在2023年早些时候预测，到2050年，全球范围内极端山火的数量将增加30%，到本世纪末将增加50%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;即便人们可以保证森林碳汇项目不会中断，全球可能也找不到那么多的土地。例如，瑞士最近与秘鲁和加纳达成了碳补偿协议，即使像瑞士这样小的国家也可能需要几乎相当于整个波多黎各岛的土地来种植树木。而四大石油和天然气公司——英国石油公司BP、埃尼、壳牌和道达尔能源若要实现2050年净零目标，需要在相当于英国面积两倍多的土地上植树造林。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一份乐施会的报告估计，要实现如今各企业承诺的碳减排计划，所需要的土地面积大概是印度面积的五倍，超过地球上全部农田面积的总和。类似的，另一份2022年由多国共20位科学家发布的“土地差距”报告（Land&amp;nbsp;Gap）显示，要实现各国政府的气候承诺，需要的面积相当于四个印度。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大量的土地需求也可能会引发对生态系统的负面影响。 IPCC的土地利用报告指出，“造林活动如果在天然无林地上部署，则可能加剧生物多样性、水和粮食安全的风险”。最近，一家位于阿联酋迪拜的bluecarbon公司传出将购买利比里亚10%的国土，用以开发碳抵消项目，引发国际社会对于当地居民生计的担忧。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一些企业已经意识到碳抵消项目的风险，并承诺放弃这一路径。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年9月，英国易捷航空作为首家宣布放弃碳抵消方案的公司，宣布将增加投入、开发直接减排技术，如开发氢燃料、优化运行效率等。易捷航空表示，预计到2050年，这些直接减排技术可以将公司的碳排放减少78%，而剩余22%的碳排放将依靠碳捕获技术处理。 2023年6月，法国雀巢公司宣布将不再采用碳抵消方式来实现公司设定的碳中和目标，未来将“致力于投资可以真正为供应链和运营带来减排的项目”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;保护好森林，让当地人受益&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2023年9月15日，生态环境部审议通过了《温室气体自愿减排交易管理办法（试行）》，意味着全国温室气体自愿减排交易市场即将重启，这其中也包括林业碳汇等项目。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;自2022年中开始，生态环境部围绕CCER（中国核证自愿减排量）项目的一系列表态表明，CCER审批被按下了重启键，也随之激发了国内碳信用的开发。近一年来林业碳汇呈现了爆发式增长，自2023年2月以来，至少有30个林业碳汇项目落地。很多企业提前布局，在林业资源丰富的地区与当地林业公司签约，将林地开发成碳汇，以期CCER一旦重启，即可进行交易（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;详见南方周末报道《&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infzm.com/contents/230498&quot; title=&quot;“空气也能卖钱”：过热的林业碳汇&quot;>;“空气也能卖钱”：过热的林业碳汇&lt;/a>;》&lt;/span>;）。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;长远来看，森林碳汇是否获得了“额外”的减排效应，保证减碳效应的持久性、经得起第三方的验证，仍是核心问题。低碳智库益科双碳中心近期发布的报告《是机遇也是风险，碳抵消对企业意味着什么？ 》就企业如何选择合适的碳抵消项目提出了建议：尽量去保护完好无损，或基本完好无损的森林，以保护林地及周边的生物多样性和生态系统为主要任务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;新版的CCER方法学中，也对森林碳汇项目的减排量核定、审定与核证机构等作出了更新规定，更加强调项目的可核验属性。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，前述“土地差距”报告作者也提到，森林碳信用开发的重点应放在阻止砍伐古老、原始森林，并使当地居民和社区受益。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;放弃森林碳抵消的话题背后，是一场旷日持久的有关“碳移除”（Carbon&amp;nbsp;Dioxide&amp;nbsp;Remove，CDR）的争论。 CDR包括了广义上从大气中去除二氧化碳的措施，现阶段主要指的是传统的方法如森林碳汇等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;未来，CDR的技术可能会扩展到直接从空气中捕获碳，并将之长期储存在陆地、海洋或岩洞里。 IPCC在最近一次的第六次评估报告中，第一次就CDR作出了政策建议，认为如果要实现全球升温控制1.5℃的目标，大规模的CDR应用将无可避免。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但“种树”之外的CDR技术，争议更大。所以，IPCC也强调，任何的碳移除手段都不能替代深度减排。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 22:25:05 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[双节有奖征集丨归与游，我的城市印记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257396]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 20:58:49&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;中秋遇上国庆，又是一年双节相逢。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;距离比赛还有3小时，媒体席已经坐满了一半，大家都知道这块金牌意味着什么——亚运电竞项目首金。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比赛的结果似乎没有悬念，王者荣耀世界冠军杯自2019年举办起，就没有中国以外的战队拿过冠军。经验丰富的记者来现场看的不是比赛，而是选手的状态。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在一名电竞杂志的记者看来，亚运电子竞技的7个项目中，《王者荣耀》的竞技性并不强，但它是7个项目里国内玩家数量最多、知名度最高的游戏，在赛程安排上又最先打到决赛，于是这款游戏也就具有了更深长的历史意义。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“2018年雅加达亚运会上，中国队就拿下了《王者荣耀》项目的冠军，但那是表演赛，今天这块金牌是有合法性的。”两届亚运会的差距反映在他的经历上，是2018年不能走媒体通道，而今年可以，“只是一个通道的不同，但心里的感受是不一样的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/mtxJzBlptUba9tQDzUY2CxCjyQJtOJtAGhyJVYRV.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;赛场内，决赛彩排开始了，赛场外，杭州电竞中心的官方特许商品零售店在进行观众入场前最后的点货。电竞项目的周边纪念品除了像其他项目一样有吉祥物品类，还有与游戏IP联名的品类，“卖得特别快”，面对为什么电竞场馆的电竞纪念品这么少的疑问时，年轻的柜哥如是回答，“吉祥物徽章基本上很难买到，一天上百个，上午就卖完了，热门的角色徽章前两天就卖完了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了应对决赛，仓库在前一天晚上紧急加货，通过能找到的所有渠道补充了一批纪念品，其中包括早已卖完的《王者荣耀》公孙离徽章，结果没能等到决赛的观众入场，“下午的季军赛之前就卖完了。”柜哥的语气带着遗憾，“我们没做好充足的心理准备。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;留给决赛观众的电竞周边不多了，“徽章卖完了，磁力书铁卖完了，钥匙扣卖完了，卡套还剩下李白和上官婉儿的，公孙离的卖完了，这个角色非常火，她的书签也只剩下两个了。”柜哥认为是选手的喜好带动了消费，他听观众讲过，选手徐必成（ID：一诺）常用的角色就是公孙离。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管柜哥的任务就是卖货，但他也对观众的购买力产生了不解，他翻开了一旁货架上的文具礼盒，“礼盒有4件物品，笔记本、笔、专属书签、便利贴，售价208元，我一开始以为没有人买，结果已经卖到差不多了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/cD1FMIJlvjfDI1M24YTRNBk6a04y1YojTNWhkdRM.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;724&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/cD1FMIJlvjfDI1M24YTRNBk6a04y1YojTNWhkdRM.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;更多的观众拥挤在入口处的大厅里，7位Cosplay游戏角色的扮演者受邀站在大厅中央，以供合影，等待合影的人在场馆志愿者身后排起了长队，几乎每个进门的观众都会停下来，辨认一番角色。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;聚集的人群让媒体记者轻易地找到他们想要采访的对象，一家来自湖北的媒体想采访武汉eStarPro战队的粉丝，这家战队有两名选手入选了国家队，分别是罗思源（ID：花海）和孙麟威（ID：坦然）。年轻姑娘杨逸清在人群中被选为受访者，她很好辨认，就穿着eStarPro战队的队服，提着一袋子应援物料。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;面对镜头，杨逸清热情地夸赞了选手的正面价值，“我想说一下罗思源，他担当起队长的责任，一直都很负责任，很坚定，很勤奋地去练，带领了队员们一起让战队获得这么多冠军，我觉得他们代表了坚持不懈、努力奋斗的精神。”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;eStarPro战队在以往的竞技比赛中获得过8个冠军，对于今晚的冠军，粉丝的心态比媒体平常许多，杨逸清说：“孙麟威选手刚过20岁生日，我也在这里祝他拿下20岁的第一块金牌。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杨逸清带来的应援物料有横幅和小旗帜，是由选手或其所属战队的粉丝后援会自发制作的。决赛前的几日，各家后援会都选择在距电竞中心一个路口的银泰百货发放，印着选手个人照片的物料是表明立场，将国家队所有选手都印上是显示格局。排面最大的要属徐必成（ID：一诺）的斑马乐园后援会，他们直接在商场1楼中庭搭建了展示区。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在比赛开场前，各家的应援物料先进行了一轮比拼，当场馆摄像机扫过观众席时，粉丝们高高举起了手中的横幅。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;观众席陆续坐满，赛场上大声播放着比赛前的暖场音乐，DJ选择了一首RAP版本的《好运来》。事实上，能来比赛现场的观众，运气都非常好。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;亚运电竞项目门票于2023年8月14日启动销售，是唯一通过抽签来决定门票购买资格的项目，也是票价最贵的项目。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;单场门票的中签率没有统计数据，但据杭州亚组委官博透露，电竞项目的门票申请购买用户至少有500万人次，每个场次的观众人数最多不超过4000人。其中，《王者荣耀》、《英雄联盟》和《Dota2》尤其热门，9月23日，官方购票系统再次放出部分门票，这三个项目的门票几乎是秒售一空。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;现场播报，刚刚结束的杭州第19届亚运会王者荣耀亚运版本决赛，中国队战胜马来西亚队，获得王者荣耀亚运版本项目冠军，夺得电子竞技项目的首块金牌，也是中国体育代表队在本届亚运会夺得的第48块金牌。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中国队与马来西亚队的决赛进行了两局，每局都以绝对的优势获胜，用时各15分钟左右。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;颁奖仪式上，几位中国选手的脸逐一出现在大屏幕上，隐隐闪现着泪光。当司仪拿起奖牌给林恒（ID：暖阳）挂上时，旁边的池晓铭（ID：Ming）误会地低了低头，又快速站好，显露了一丝他的紧张情绪。同样表现出紧张的还有徐必成，面对全场观众的欢呼，他抬起右手不自觉地挠了挠头。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;退场后，6名选手经过混合采访区，长长的通道里站满了记者和志愿者，媒体入口处立起一块小黑板，“混合采访区已满”。几个刚获奖的年轻人分散开，各自对着眼前蜂拥的话筒和镜头表达此刻的激动。蒋涛（ID：阿豆）发表完一轮感言，准备离开，又被一叠声叫住，他停住的地方立刻围上几十名记者，声量最大的人才能抢到提问权。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后一个问题由一名女记者抢到：“你想对我们的观众说什么？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我做到了，我相信你们也能做到。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;说完这句话，阿豆在队务的陪同下向出口走去。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
