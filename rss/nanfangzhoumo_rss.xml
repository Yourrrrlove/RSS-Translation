I have been publishing works since I was in high school, and I am still living a seemingly unemployed life in my thirties. I always feel embarrassed when faced with inquiries from strangers. When she went to the barber shop and lay down to wash her hair, sooner or later a routine question came from the top of her head: &quot;What do you do?&quot; Sometimes she answered the teacher, sometimes she said it was sales, she said whatever came to her mind, but she couldn&#39;t tell the truth, and sometimes she said it was sales. There are no pre-programmed complete answers. Once the other party asked, she was helpless and allowed the sound of running water to flow by awkwardly. If you can’t answer it, I won’t make it up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The funniest time in my memory came from a fellow traveler I met when I was paragliding. The other person asked you what you were doing? Qi Jinnian answered in Sichuan dialect, &quot;I work in publishing.&quot; Since the pronunciation was similar, the other party then asked sincerely, &quot;How much does the best kitchen board cost per meter now?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This encounter made me even more sad. Qi Jinnian is convinced, &quot;Publishing or books are something that is far away from normal people, let alone saying that you are a writer. I would think it would be too weird to tell others that you are writing.&quot; She lives her life like a covert spy. In bustling Chengdu, I write in the morning, read in the afternoon, and sometimes go to the gym to exercise, and then come back in the evening to watch movies and read books. I don’t cook, but it’s hard to tell my friends from out of town about restaurant recommendations. She is used to blanching vegetables over high heat, and then ordering takeout from a limited number of restaurants that suit her taste. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/6L3eeOGIdCZDmkV3LLsj1DToDa7r7e0VcFk0hvY7.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/6L3eeOGIdCZDmkV3LLsj1DToDa7r7e0VcFk0hvY7.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253688&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hiking everywhere&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It doesn’t matter whether you stay home or not , &quot;We really don&#39;t care.&quot; She is more concerned about the world outside the dozens of square meters of space. When the weather is nice, I go paragliding alone, and during holidays I go caving and rock climbing with my teammates. She joined the Shanshui Nature Conservation Center a few years ago and also threw herself to different Hengduan Mountains during the COVID-19 epidemic. The older she gets, the more animalistic nature emerges in her heart. Her yearning and primitive desire for nature have become a stronger attachment than emotion. She jokes that she has transformed into a &quot;part-time human being.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Irish female writer Claire Geoghegan (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;translated one of her short story collections &quot;Fostering&quot;&lt;/p>; span>;) wrote a passage, which happens to be very suitable to describe her. &quot;Writing is a strange profession, especially at my age. They mentally calculate how old I am, trying to remember what happened when I was born and who died. They can&#39;t be sure, but I&#39;m definitely not a little girl anymore. I You should do something else now, and tie yourself to an unmarried man with a stable income and a good car.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Qijing Nian, writing is not a dream planned since childhood. When I was less than 20 years old, my work &quot;The Bed Is the Tomb of Youth&quot; sold a million copies, and things happened suddenly. Thinking about it now, she really wants to have the life of a sports star. When she meets a child who is good at climbing in the rock climbing gym, she will feel jealous and then get upset, &quot;What did I do when I was a child? 9 to 12 years old is the most suitable for rock climbing. He is very light in weight and of the right size. If he has this kind of hobby, that would be great!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She sincerely envied Federer&#39;s life. &quot;When he retired, he was probably only in his thirties. After you have reached the pinnacle of your career, your life is actually still very long.&quot; It is obviously difficult for writers to end abruptly at this age. In September 2023, her collection of travel essays &quot;Crossing the Wandering Road&quot; was published. She had not published a book for the previous three years. During this period, she had to face the social expectations of editors and readers. She and artist Chen Xiaoyi traveled together in the Hengduan Mountains. Along the way, the two occasionally discussed the invisible publishing rhythm of each other&#39;s work. &quot;Artists like them also have to hold solo exhibitions or participate in group exhibitions every year to maintain a career.&quot; Online status. Otherwise, you will hear suspicion from the outside world, saying, &quot;What is this person still doing?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/11/X9MaAJCMB12UFxk9962T9eNT5XwhqxiQYCT8kNjt.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/X9MaAJCMB12UFxk9962T9eNT5Xwh qxiQYCT8kNjt. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253691&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Ice Climbing&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Interviewee Provided/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, this kind of sound would make her panic, but then she figured it out, &quot;Creation is really not like knitting a sweater, just knit it one piece at a time, right?&quot; Some people can, but for me, I am indeed writing slower and slower now. It takes as much time to revise as it does to write. &quot;Crossing the Waves&quot; took at least a year to revise, and I kept looking for the structure again and again.&quot; Objective Difficulty Increase, there is also some subjective psychological resistance. &quot;I have passed 35 years old, and my growth has changed a lot. This kind of creative pace is also a kind of discipline given to me by society. Rather than writing a book every year, what I am more worried about now is how to take advantage of my health. When you are good, you can experience more various sports and life. In fact, the older you get, the more you shrink. Because writing can last a lifetime, but if you want to do some outdoor sports, or even just climb a mountain, By the time you are sixty or seventy years old, your body will be incomparable to what you were in your twenties and thirties.&quot; Her most ideal life state is to &quot;travel around the world in the first 30 years, study in the next 30 years, and concentrate on writing in the last 30 years.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;The following is her self-report:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Destiny is like raindrops&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I set foot on My professional writing path started relatively early, and I think it has been well-known to many readers. But in fact, it is just like a certain brand effect. Maybe people’s impression of you, or what they think of when you mention this name, is still the things you wrote many years ago. , related to the label of youth literature, but both the &quot;post-80s&quot; generation and youth literature have become somewhat less purely positive. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I have thought about it in the past few years and feel that it is not a big deal. You cannot expect a 17-year-old Kids wrote &quot;War and Peace,&quot; right? It’s not that what I’m writing now is “War and Peace”, it’s just that I’m actually quite helpless about this process. Things like labels always have a lag. You yourself are growing, and the readers are actually growing too, and we have to accompany each other. A feeling is enough. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Last summer I participated in the Creative Writing Program (IWP, International Writing Program) at the University of Iowa. As soon as I landed, two of my readers who were studying for Ph.D.s there came to the event and chatted with me enthusiastically, taking me to local delicious places. I thought it was quite normal to meet readers in China, but I didn’t expect that I could meet them in such a far away place, which really moved me. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/aV2tu07sPsZN2zibW0qi0TKIMsCDocLsamlKOc14.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 607&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/aV2tu07sPsZN2zibW0qi0TKIMsCDocLsamlKOc14.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253685&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Cave exploration&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I think it was because of the new concept essay contest (I don’t know if the new concept still exists now). At that time, our &quot;post-80s&quot; generation was still very popular. Sensational. I participated in the sixth session, my sophomore year in high school (2002). After winning the award, I was very lucky to join Guo Jingming’s team and caught up with the wave of that type of literature, so it was quite smooth along the way. Then I couldn’t help but think about it. It’s been almost 20 years now, right? It must have been there for 15 years, quite tired. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After writing for a long time, I have completely entered a professional state. The feeling of publishing a book is to me It’s like a step-by-step process like moving up to first grade, then second grade, and third grade. You may no longer find that sense of accomplishment like “Ah, look! Look, this is a book I published!” &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;At first, I really wrote casually. During self-study in the evening, others were doing homework, and I was writing. There has been no long break in publishing over the years, and I have always maintained the rhythm of interspersed collections of novels and essays. The previous book &quot;Crossing the Wandering Road&quot; was the 2019 &quot;Evening Breeze Pillow Wine&quot;. This book is mainly to give me the previous three years. An explanation. During the three years of the epidemic, I think everyone may have had a difficult time, and everyone has their own understanding. For me, the biggest thing is that after the normal order of life is disrupted, you find that what seems orderly is actually quite fragile, and you may be powerless about it and can only accept impermanence. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/0bz6Cl8Ong2mQM9o3jU8GLR44poAeCWfreFETxZO.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 643&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/0bz6Cl8Ong2mQM9o3jU8GLR44poAeCWfreFETxZO.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253677&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Since I have been very fond of nature and travel since I was a child, and I am afraid of heat, I basically go to national parks in other countries every summer. , driving, camping, and climbing all the way, completely in nature. Sometimes with companions, such as when I went to Canada in 2017, and most of the time alone, such as when I went to the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Norway, etc. The most recent time was to Alaska in 2018. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I have traveled to many places. During the epidemic, it was impossible to go to all of them. Fortunately, Sichuan Province is really big and rich in natural resources. In the past, I didn’t even realize that the Hengduan Mountains in my hometown were so rich in landforms. So in the past three years, I have looked around me with a withdrawn look and found that it turned out that Maybe you don’t even understand the world around you. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Western Sichuan obviously shares the same time, space and cultural background with us. Maybe I share a Gongga The physical distance between herdsmen children in mountain villages is only three to four hundred kilometers, but our lives are so different. I live in Chengdu. After being stuck in the city for a long time, my vision is relatively narrow. I feel that life can only be like a canal, going to school, getting a job, and starting a family. It seems that other life is not recognized. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;But in fact, if you walk into the mountains and take a look, you can realize what the Vietnamese proverb says, &quot;Destiny is like raindrops, some fall in the palace, and some fall in the fields.&quot; Seeing those herdsmen or monks who are at ease, their lives are winding like natural rivers. Today, when you should go to farm, just farm. If you need to harvest matsutake, just harvest matsutake, or dig up cordyceps. As for tomorrow, you don’t think too much about it. Life is very diverse - you don’t have to rush to the end like a canal. You may find a vast ocean, which is actually Nothingness. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/9OcTbSJCq3A1J5wpqhurf8NU5sn8WGGEy1aF9hXm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 800&quot; height=&quot;1102&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/9OcTbSJCq3A1J5wpqhurf8NU5sn8WGGEy1aF9hXm.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253678&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Maybe you read Sartre and existentialism when you were a child, but you didn’t understand it at all. But now, I feel that you have almost lived enough to start to really understand it. Thinking about &quot;what is freedom, what is the purpose of living, and whether life has meaning?&quot; It&#39;s time to really feel the torture brought about by this nothingness. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I agree that life is defined by every choice of oneself, and it has a lot of richness. possibility, but it seems that once you live in the city for a long time, you will easily limit yourself. Anyway, this is the biggest feedback that entering the mountains gave me. In the past, I seemed to be a person who was more or less out of place in real life. First of all, my freelance career may be different from the life of many office workers (when I get together with other freelance friends, we never talk about social security); in addition, my peers around me may have already gotten married and had children, which is very important to me. It&#39;s very far away, but if you live in such an impatient society, you will often have a lot of doubts about your position. Always thinking, oh, what am I going to do next? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Sometimes in the morning I see cleaners, takeaway riders, and people wearing orange-red overalls on the roadside. Office workers with mobile phones, students carrying schoolbags sleepily crossing the road, these daily scenes are like tracks, so legitimate and solid; in comparison, although I am not like a derailed carriage, at least I am playing truant. Feeling uneasy like that - when a person chooses to write for a living and choose freelancing, she has chosen a narrower and more difficult path. Fortunately, the past few years in the mountains have given me many epiphanies about this step-by-step approach. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When I went mountaineering for the first time, the guide told me that mountaineering is a process of dialogue with oneself. , in fact you are really tired when you climb, you don’t have time to think about anything, just like a walking robot, walking on flat ground may be very tiring carrying things, not to mention when you are at high altitude, you will be very out of breath as soon as you get up. tired. Many high mountains in Europe may only be 3,000 meters high, but the altitude of a county in Litang in western Sichuan may be as high as 4,000 meters, which can easily cause altitude sickness. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;My mind is blank, and the easiest thing to think of is &quot;Why should I suffer this here!&quot; &quot;That process is not actually a conversation with myself, but a flow experience in which the sense of time is lost. I am completely immersed in the present. I don&#39;t think about why I am walking here at all, and I don&#39;t have so many poetic thoughts. I just think about this step. Step forward to the place where you will rest tonight. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;But looking back, these processes have brought me a very rich experience. Many joys or twists and turns and even some very embarrassing moments that do not need to be written in the diary but are retained in visual observations are all in this process. Looking back, every fragment and moment on the road brought me a rich real journey. feelings, rather than saying that I successfully climbed to the top, or which scenic spot we saw today. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/LrWYOKQMAGpeBi6n3HooHIbgRA61KYP7aUFfOlv4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 800&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/LrWYOKQMAGpeBi6n3HooHIbgRA61KYP7aUFfOlv4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253683&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When I read Han Dong a few years ago, he said, &quot;After stripping away the purpose of life, what remains is a process of making a difference. .&quot; I feel that the deepest experience I have gained from repeated trips into the mountains is also the joy of the details of the process itself. We are not looking for a specific attraction or destination on every trip. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Those existential confusions in past life: Since living is meaningless, existence is Nothingness, everyone is free, but freedom is just a construction. How do you make choices and invent meaning. This kind of confusion is not like Zen Buddhism, which can be enlightened with a bang. It is a process in itself, and it is just a process, just like mountain climbing. Why is it so painful and painful? Going up and coming down again, what are you trying to figure out? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Later I learned that it is not to go up in order to come down, but to come down in order to go up, and it is Go up again and again. Some people say, &quot;Life is for one thing.&quot; Find this thing and devote yourself to it, that&#39;s enough. Whether it&#39;s mountaineering, writing, paragliding, or protecting the forest... the meaning doesn&#39;t exist, but your life is well spent because of it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[男子遭邻居砸门近一年：数十次报警为何换不来警方追责]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258511]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-14 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;According to the Qilu Evening News, a man in Songyuan, Jilin said that he called the police after his neighbor banged on his door and cursed him for nearly a year. After forty or fifty times the problem has not been solved. The man said that his children have gone to college and he and his wife have to go to work, but a female neighbor downstairs always says there is something going on at home. To this end, the man laid carpets at his house, gave away the cat, and paid attention to details in his life, but the neighbors still refused to give in. The local police station dispatched police several times, but the neighbors still ignored it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Conflicts often arise between neighbors over trivial matters. For example, some people love to keep pets, but their playful and noisy pets may affect others. According to reports, neighbors downstairs reported that there was a lot of noise in the man&#39;s home. The man had sent away the cat and laid carpets to minimize the impact on the neighbors. If they believe that the disturbances in the man&#39;s home still have an impact on his life, he can report it to the property management and neighborhood committee and ask them to mediate and resolve the matter. You can also file a lawsuit in court based on this, but you need to provide real evidence of the other party&#39;s infringement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the method the woman adopted was to go to other people&#39;s homes, smash the door and curse. In the video, the woman also kicked the door with her feet and took out a stick to smash the door. According to the man involved, his door was severely damaged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, the woman smashed doors and cursed for nearly a year on the grounds that other people&#39;s movements interfered with her life. This not only had a serious impact on the man&#39;s life, she was also suspected of damaging other people&#39;s property, and her behavior also affected other neighbors. Because of this, the unsettled man called the police. However, despite forty or fifty calls to the police, the woman&#39;s behavior was still not effectively stopped, reflecting the mishandling of the incident by the local police. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 9 of the &quot;Public Security Management Punishment Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; stipulates that for minor violations of public security management such as fighting or damaging other people&#39;s property caused by civil disputes, the public security organs may mediate and deal with them. If the parties reach an agreement through mediation by the public security organ, they will not be punished. If no agreement is reached after mediation or the agreement is not fulfilled, the public security organs shall impose penalties on the perpetrators of violations of public security management in accordance with the provisions of this Law, and inform the parties that they may file a civil lawsuit with the People&#39;s Court for civil disputes in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the man originally called the police, the police believed that the woman’s behavior was minor and they could just mediate the matter. However, the neighbor did not accept mediation and continued to harass and even damage other people&#39;s property. Obviously, his behavior does not fall into the category of minor circumstances, and the police should punish him in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In response to this matter, the police should do at least two things in handling this matter. First of all, in the initial mediation process, it is necessary to declare to both parties their respective rights and obligations within the scope of the law. The man has the right not to be harassed. If the female neighbor thinks that the movement in the man’s home interferes with her life, she can Submit this to the court. At the same time, the police should explain the legal basis for the mediation method in this matter, and warn the female neighbor what legal consequences she will face if she cannot accept mediation and continues to smash the door and other behaviors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, when mediation fails again and again and the vicious cycle of the man calling the police and the woman refusing to accept mediation continues to smash the door, the police should resolutely follow the law enforcement authority granted by the &quot;Public Security Administration Punishment Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; and punish It imposes penalties. Calling the police 40 or 50 times in a row failed to stop the woman&#39;s behavior, not to mention making the man involved feel helpless in safeguarding his rights according to law. It was also a huge waste of police resources. At the same time, in the woman&#39;s eyes, the police repeatedly sent out police but never further restricted her behavior, which made it easier for her to be arrogant and &quot;the law can&#39;t do anything to me.&quot; Perhaps it was precisely because of the inaction of the local police time and time again that the woman&#39;s behavior escalated, from cursing to smashing the door. If left unaddressed, the woman&#39;s subsequent behavior may turn into violence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For such incidents, decisive punishment of the woman after police mediation fails is the key to protecting the rights of the victims. If the police fail to hold people accountable in a timely manner and in accordance with the law, it will only encourage illegal behavior and even lead to further deterioration of the situation and cause more social problems. At the same time, this will also mislead others, making them mistakenly believe that there are no legal red lines for such behavior and they can do it arbitrarily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no precedent for the police to deal with such incidents decisively and hold the offenders accountable. According to a report by Time Video in May 2023, in a community in Chaoyang District, Beijing, knocking sounds on the walls of residential buildings were often heard in the middle of the night, causing residents to have trouble sleeping. After investigation, the police identified the resident Liu. According to Liu, he had conflicts with his neighbors because of the poor sound insulation of the house. In order to retaliate, Liu chose to knock on the wall. Because Liu&#39;s behavior disturbed the people and lasted for a long time, he was suspected of provoking quarrels and causing trouble, so he was administratively detained by the public security organs in accordance with the law. If the police do not deal with Liu, I am afraid that residents will still be harassed by him for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regarding incidents of neighborhood nuisance, it is often the case that &quot;the public says the public is right, and the mother-in-law says the mother-in-law is right.&quot; Some parties involved may not have a sufficient understanding of the law. These factors may affect the effectiveness of police mediation. However, this does not mean that the police can relax the enforcement of the law, especially not to treat people differently based on their gender, age, etc. If the above incident involved a man breaking down the door for nearly a year and the woman repeatedly calling the police, will the police tolerate the continuation of such incidents? In fact, the police treat all cases equally and use facts instead of other factors as the basis for law enforcement. This can only reflect judicial fairness, maintain order and fairness in the entire society, and allow offenders to understand the seriousness and inviolability of the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is the author&#39;s personal opinion only and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[多名培训机构人员组织研究生考试作弊获刑]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258489]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-14 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On October 11, 2023, the Beijing Haidian District People’s Court prosecuted the defendant Zhang and others for using wireless Transmission method, in the 2021 and 2022 National Master&#39;s Degree Admissions Examination, the first instance verdict was issued on the cheating case of candidates in the examination.

During this period, Zhang was responsible for recruiting candidates, purchasing cheating equipment, registering rooms near the test site and installing signal transmitting devices, contacting examination questions, making and sending answers; Lu helped Zhang organize candidate information and candidate feedback questions, organize answer formats and send them , Xu trains candidates, tests equipment, recruits &quot;mules&quot; (i.e., signal amplifier caregivers), and sends answers to candidates during exams; Xu sends and receives express delivery, repairs equipment, and directs &quot;mules&quot; to switch equipment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/64db816c9fe5e43c7325015799d0dff8.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/64db816c9fe5e43c7325015799d0dff8.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253952&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of December 25, 2021, Zhang organized many candidates to cheat in the 2022 National Master&#39;s Degree Admissions Examination, and arranged for personnel to place signal amplifiers near many universities in Beijing to send answers to the candidates.

Using wireless transmission to organize multiple candidates to cheat, the circumstances are serious, and their actions have constituted the crime of organizing exam cheating. Among them, the defendants Zhang, Xu, Niu, Du, Zhang, Jiang, and Wang were the principal offenders; the defendants Lu and Xu were the accomplices. The court made the above judgment in accordance with the law based on factors such as the defendant&#39;s criminal facts, nature, circumstances, degree of social harm, attitude of confession and repentance, and circumstances of returning stolen goods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the verdict was announced, the defendants did not clearly indicate whether they would appeal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;strong>;The judge’s interpretation: &lt;/strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cheating in exams undermines the exam system and talent selection system, hinders fair competition, and undermines social integrity. Corrupting social morals has serious social harm. In particular, organized examination cheating activities using information technology means are particularly harmful. To this end, the &quot;Criminal Law Amendment (9)&quot; has added provisions such as the crime of cheating in organized examinations, the crime of illegally selling and providing test questions and answers, and the crime of substitute examination, to severely punish the crime of cheating in examinations. Since then, the two top universities have issued the &quot;Interpretation on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Laws in the Handling of Criminal Cases such as Organized Exam Cheating&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Interpretation&quot;), which further provides specific provisions on the conviction, sentencing and application of laws for the crime of examination cheating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The National Postgraduate Admissions Examination involved in this case is a national education examination stipulated by law. It is an important channel for selecting high-level professionals in our country. It has high social attention, great influence, and wide coverage. It is of national importance. take an exam. Article 2, Item (1) of the &quot;Interpretation&quot; directly stipulates that &quot;organizing cheating in the admission examination of ordinary colleges and universities, the admission examination of graduate students, and the recruitment examination of civil servants&quot; is directly defined as &quot;serious circumstances.&quot; The defendants in this case clearly knew that the candidates were participating in the national master&#39;s degree admissions examination, but still participated in it and organized cheating, which is a &quot;serious circumstance.&quot; According to Article 284-1 of the Criminal Law, anyone who organizes cheating and the circumstances are serious shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years but not more than seven years, and shall also be fined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a practical point of view, the crime of cheating in exams has the possibility of re-offending to a certain extent. In order to prevent criminals from &quot;returning to their old careers&quot;, this case is based on the provisions of Article 12 of the &quot;Interpretation&quot; and Zhang is punished in accordance with the law. The nine defendants were declared occupationally prohibited, that is, the nine defendants were prohibited from engaging in occupations related to education, examinations, and training within five years from the date of completion of the sentence or the date of parole; at the same time, the defendants who were sentenced to probation were prohibited from engaging in occupations related to education, examination, and training within five years from the date of completion of the sentence or the date of parole; at the same time, the defendants who were sentenced to probation were prohibited from engaging in occupations related to education, examination, and training within five years from the date of completion of the sentence or the date of parole; A prohibition order is issued in accordance with the law, which means that he is prohibited from engaging in activities related to education, examinations, and training during the probation period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Ten years of hard work, but one day of hard work&quot;, examination fairness is a bottom line that cannot be touched in society. Cheating in exams not only undermines exam fairness, but also affects social fairness and seriously harms individual candidates and national interests. &quot;The French Open will be open without any omissions,&quot; organizers should not take any chances. They also hope that every candidate will strictly abide by the law, take the exam with integrity, refuse to cheat, and use their hard work to obtain satisfactory answers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 08:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[透视银行半年报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258551]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-13 23:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;Commercial banks are not only the transmission system of macro-control policies, but also an excellent window for observing the micro-economy.

The experience of Mr. Su Jing, the author of &quot;Thirty Collectors of Modern Books&quot;, is also very legendary. For details, please refer to Zou Zhenhuan&#39;s &quot;The &quot;Paradigm Shift&quot; of Chinese Book Publishing - Reading Su Jing&#39;s &quot;Casting to Replace Engraving: Missionaries and the Changing Situation of Chinese Printing&quot; 》, I won’t go into details here. Going back to &quot;Thirty Modern Book Collectors&quot;, when the Taiwanese biographical literature edition was published, only two biographers of the thirty names recorded in the book were still alive. One of them was Zhou Shutao (1891-1984) who passed away the following year, and the other It was Pan Jingzheng (1907-2003) who passed away 20 years later. It is unknown whether Mr. Zhou Shutao has seen &quot;Thirty Collectors of Modern Books&quot;. However, Mr. Pan Jingzheng did read the Taiwanese version of &quot;Thirty Modern Book Collectors&quot; and commented on it in a letter to Mr. Shen Xieyuan. In 1995, the first issue of Nanjing Normal University&#39;s &quot;Cultural and Educational Materials&quot; compiled an album of information on Pan Jingzheng. In addition to Xu Xiaoman&#39;s article &quot;Mr. Pan Jingzheng, the bibliographer&quot;, the other two articles were &quot;Pan Jingzheng&quot; signed by &quot;Shu Lu&quot; &quot;Biography of Mr. Jing Zheng&quot; and &quot;Catalogue of Writings of Mr. Pan Jingzheng&quot;. From Mr. Pan Jingzheng&#39;s letters, the author quite doubts that &quot;Shu Lu&quot; is a temporary pen name created by Mr. Shen or him and others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently sorting out the remains of Mr. Shen Xieyuan, I found more than ten handwritten notes from Pan Jing and Zheng Zheng to Shen Xieyuan, mainly written from the late 1970s to the early 1990s. Most of them were written with brushes and paper. , seal, which are identical to the letters collected by &quot;Pan Jingzheng&quot; (edited by Wang Guichen and Wang Dawen), the first volume of the &quot;Scholar&#39;s Ink Collection&quot; published by Guangdong Education Press in June 2022. I would like to select Shutong and briefly reveal his abilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;一&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Previously, the author wrote in &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/contents/255656&quot; title=&quot;Old friends smile more than the trees in the courtyard: Shen Xieyuan and Qu Fengqi As mentioned in the article &quot;An old friend smiled more than the tree in the atrium: A brief account of Shen Xieyuan and Qu Fengqi&lt;/a>;&quot;, Gu Tinglong, Pan Jingzheng, and Qu Fengqi all once collected the &quot;Er Golden Butterfly Hall Seal&quot; for Mr. Shen Xieyuan. inscription. Letters from Mr. Qu Fengqi were also forwarded through Mr. Pan Jingzheng. In an existing letter from Mr. Pan Jingzheng dated October 13, 1982, he once mentioned a sentence: &quot;It belongs to the seal of Uncle Bazhuo, and is compiled into short words for correction. If it is not applicable, throw it into the toilet for correction.&quot; This was related to this matter. Mr. Pan Jingzheng inscribed &quot;Er Jindie Hall Printing&quot; and first filled in the words &quot;Unforgettable&quot;:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Before the wind and rain, I am afraid of chasing after others and looking for claws, and check the confusion.

He relied heavily on sound throughout his life, and he continued to do so until he was old. Mr. Wei Li obtained a kind of &quot;Inscriptions on Letters Written by Qing Dynasty People in Inkstones&quot;. Mr. Pan wrote a line of words for almost every letter, which is a good proof. Especially in his later years, Mr. Pan Jingzheng preferred to write lyrics in rare ancient books instead of inscriptions and postscripts. This tendency of using rhyme instead of prose is somewhat similar to that of Gu Wenbin, the owner of Guoyun Tower. Gu Wenbin said that rhyme is better than prose, so he exploits his strengths and avoids his weaknesses. The reason why Mr. Pan Jingzheng is like this, I think, he considers himself a poet with romantic feelings and literary temperament from beginning to end. The poem &quot;Unforgettable&quot; is prefaced by Zhu Wenfang Yin - &quot;I am also a lyricist in Wuzhong&quot;, which can be called a portrayal. Mr. Shen Jin recalled that the title of Mr. Pan Jingzheng&#39;s article was &quot;A Piece of Ice Heart in a Jade Pot&quot;, which was really appropriate and can be said to be insightful. There is a long postscript after the poem &quot;Unforgettable Meanings&quot;:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;My friend Shen Junxieyuan came from his old home in Yuyi to acquire the work of Mr. Zhao Shushu. The inscription is eighty-two, the dress is in a bow, and the treasure is left in the office of Qian Wu Hufan&#39;s uncle. Compared with Shanghai, it is a metaphor, which means &quot;Hongzhao&quot;. Most of the prints in the book were engraved by Shen Yunchu and Wei Jiasun, and some were engraved and consumed by themselves. There are two seals carved by the ancestor of Zheng&#39;an, one is a large square seal with three characters &quot;Pang Xizhai&quot; and the other is a rectangular seal with three characters &quot;Hanxueju&quot;, both of which are exquisite works. Shen, Wei, and Mr. Xiang are all in perfect agreement, and all the seals should be perfect. I have collected fifty or sixty stones of Mr.&#39;s seals, and they have all been returned to the Shanghai Museum. The collections of Shen and Wei are no longer traceable. Hundreds of years of vicissitudes, gathering and dispersing smoke and clouds, make me feel sad. The word &quot;Yuan&quot; is added to &quot;Wu&quot; to repay one&#39;s fate. In his declining years, his writing and writing are desolate, and I feel ashamed.

This is proved by the fact that the seal used by Pan Zuyin is on display in the Seal Hall of the Shanghai Museum. The seal &quot;Pang Xizhai&quot; is clearly visible, which is true. In the past, the Suzhou Museum held a special exhibition &quot;Planning the Ancient World: The Collection of Pan in Suzhou during the Qing Dynasty&quot;. They tried to borrow the giant seal &quot;Pang Xizhai&quot; for the exhibition but failed. They had to replace it with a seal titled &quot;Wuxian Pan Boyin&#39;s Life and Authentic Appreciation&quot;. Breathless. As far as the author knows, there are at least four giant seals of the Zhai name used by Pan Zuyin. In addition to &quot;Pang Xi Zhai&quot;, there are also three seals of &quot;Pangu Lou&quot;, &quot;Zheng&#39;an&quot; and &quot;Plum Blossom Happy God&#39;s Pavilion&quot;. According to Mr. Shen Xieyuan&#39;s recollection, after Mr. Pan Jingzheng wrote the postscript for &quot;Er Golden Butterfly Hall Yin Cun&quot;, he gave a piece of paper with the seal number of Pan Zuyinzhai as a gift, which was not found in the &quot;Yin Cun&quot;. It was bound. I wonder if it is still in the book? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have heard from Mr. Shen Xieyuan more than once before that in addition to the ink ink of Mr. Pan Jingzheng in his collection, there are also two handwritten lyrics written by him. It was not until September 2012 that I had the opportunity to see them in Shen Zhai, Xitang North Lane. However, within a few years, these two pieces were scattered among the people. Now that I think about it, I still feel very regretful. The two poems are self-composed, one horizontal and one vertical. The vertical ones are made of plain paper, and are signed: &quot;The book &quot;Qingmen Yin&quot; was presented to Xueyuan&#39;s brother-in-law Jiaozheng. In the first month of Wuchen, Pan Jingzheng was eighty-two years old.&quot; Also sealed are the four seals of &quot;Xingyang Zonglao&quot;, &quot;Prime Minister Shaozai&#39;s great-grandson Hanlin&#39;s grandson&quot;, &quot;Pan Jingzheng&#39;s seal&quot; and &quot;original name Chengbi&quot;.

Since the original signature does not have a year, we relied on the records in &quot;Haineng Baichuan&amp;nbsp;Knowledge Navigation: Collected Works to Commemorate the 60th Anniversary of the Establishment of the Shanghai Library&quot;. On December 26, 1975, after three months of preparations, the Shanghai Library established the &quot;Seven 21 &quot;The university offers four classes: basic library knowledge, English, Japanese, and ancient books. The ancient books class has been out of work for one year. &quot;Most of the ancient books students have stuck to their majors and have become the ancient books management and research team of the Shanghai Library. For example, Chen Xianxian became an ancient books expert at the Shanghai Library, and Yan Zuozhi became the director of the Ancient Books Research Institute of East China Normal University. &quot;. Regarding the situation of the &quot;721&quot; University, I once called Mr. Shen Jin who was far away in the United States. According to his recollection, there were 15 students in the ancient books class at that time, and the class leader was Zhu Binyong, who later worked in the library of Fudan University. The teachers who teach include Gu Tinglong, Pan Jingzheng, Qu Fengqi, Ruan Henghui, Chen Shiming, Chen Bingren, Ren Guangliang, Wu Zhi and Shen Jin. Among them, Mr. Pan Jingzheng teaches the most frequently. The course lectures he is responsible for include &quot;Engraved Editions of Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasties&quot; and &quot;Manuscripts&quot;. &quot;History&quot;, &quot;School-based Lecture Notes&quot;, &quot;Stone Carving Lecture Notes&quot;, &quot;Dharma Notes Lecture Notes&quot;, etc. It is unknown whether the mimeograph version of &quot;Knowledge of Ancient Book Versions&quot; was used for reference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth mentioning that as early as 1957, when Xinhua Bookstore in Jiangsu Province held a training class for managers of Xinhua Bookstores in the province, Mr. Shen Xieyuan was invited to teach the history of Chinese books. In May 1965, he was invited to teach the ancient part of Chinese calligraphy history to a training class for amateur university library staff in Gulou District, Nanjing City (mainly librarians in colleges and universities). Since then, related activities have been suspended due to various reasons. In 1975, Jiangsu Province re-organized a study class for ancient books staff, and he was invited to teach about the Song and Yuan editions. After entering the 1980s, he was invited to teach ancient book editions in 1985 as a national training course on ancient book restoration commissioned by the National Library Administration and organized by the Shanghai Library. In June 1986, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Culture commissioned the Nanjing Library to hold a seminar on the regulations for recording Chinese ancient books in Jiangsu Province, and he was invited to give lectures on the cataloging of ancient books. Since then, he has taught edition bibliography courses to students majoring in related majors at Nanjing Normal University and Nanjing University. Although we have not seen the complete lecture notes left by Mr. Shen Xieyuan during this period, among his belongings, we still found some manuscripts of lecture notes on edition and bibliography, some written with brushes and some with hard pens, and they are not too long. It is very large. If I have the opportunity to sort it out in the future, it can be used as a supplement to the &quot;Collected Works of Shen Xieyuan&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time that Mr. Shen Xieyuan and Mr. Pan Jingzheng were invited to teach versionology in the ancient literature major of Nanjing Normal University, Mr. Pan Jingzheng was hired as a part-time professor by the Ancient Books Department of East China Normal University and taught graduate students. On February 2, 1983, Mr. Pan Jingzheng wrote in a letter saying:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I would like to ask the director of Tianzhen Museum on my behalf. I was given a volume of the great work &quot;Yangzhou Poetry Bureau Examination&quot;. Since my brother is giving a lecture for postgraduate students, I can use it to supplement the materials. I am particularly grateful if I can send it immediately. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is to ask Mr. Shen Xieyuan to ask Mr. Pan Tianzhen for the article &quot;Miscellaneous Examination of Yangzhou Poetry Bureau&quot; newly published in the 1983 issue of &quot;Library Science Newsletter&quot; as a reference for teaching edition science . On January 17, 1990, Mr. Pan Jingzheng sent a letter to inform him that &quot;after my retirement this year, I will not be able to go out. Recently my blood pressure is high and I have to take a rest. Four people have graduated from the Normal University this year and they will no longer be Feng&#39;s wife.&quot; &quot;Exactly.&quot; It can be seen that when he retired from the Shanghai Library, he no longer served as a graduate tutor at East China Normal University. At this time, Mr. Pan Jingzheng was already eighty-four years old. Among the graduate students taught by East China Normal University, the student that Mr. Pan Jingzheng admires most is Lin Shenqing, the editor of &quot;Seals of Ming and Qing Bibliophiles&quot; and &quot;Seals of Chinese Bibliophiles&quot;. The publication of the 1989 edition of &quot;Seals of Ming and Qing Bibliophiles&quot; was the result of strong recommendation from Mr. Pan Jingzheng. Among the letters written by Pan&#39;s inkstones and friends, only &quot;The Letters of Zhang Taiyan&quot; have been compiled and published in the 17th volume of &quot;Xue Ji Lin&quot;, and the letters of Guo Moruo have been included in the article &quot;The Posthumous Letters of Guo Moruo and &quot;Guanzi Collection&quot;&quot; Library Journal, Issue 3, 1999, the authors are all Lin Shenqing, which shows that Mr. Pan Jingzheng held him in high esteem. Unfortunately, Lin died young and was unable to complete the collection and research of the letters written by friends in Yanlou. , which is regrettable. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;三&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Mr. Pan Jingzheng, like Gu Tinglong and Qu Fengqi, are very supportive of Mr. Shen Xieyuan’s collection and arrangement of Huang Pilie’s inscriptions and postscripts. He once mentioned in his letters that &quot;it will be beneficial to write Huang&#39;s postscripts. I hope Mr. Gu can help me with my essays such as those on the Bo.&quot; It is undeniable that &quot;the previous letter of courtesy is based on the information of Huangxunpu. Because the matter is too long and nothing has been gained, it cannot be replied.&quot; If you see anything, you will be notified in a letter, such as the letter on October 18, 1981:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Xie Yuan My brother asked: I sent you a copy ten days ago, and I want to go to the record room. The information on Xicheng Garden published in Taiwanese publications has been borrowed from Yang Junkanen of the Academy of Social Sciences on behalf of him, and was copied by Comrade Shen Jin, who agreed to receive it that morning. If you are sincere, I would like to order &quot;Jiangsu Library Work&quot;. I hope that I can arrange it on my behalf. It is best to start from the first issue last year (it has been published to the seventh issue now). Because it is issued internally, there is no way to place an order here. If you need a certain amount of money, please ask for instructions and it will be remitted immediately. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person mentioned in the above letter as &quot;the information on Xicheng Garden has been included in Taiwanese publications&quot; should be Hong Kong scholar Luo Bingmian&#39;s &quot;Research on Huang Pilie&quot;. This article was included in the 1976 edition of Taiwan Food Publishing House. Luo&#39;s &quot;Collection of Qing Dynasty Scholars&quot;. In Mr. Shen Xieyuan&#39;s case, there is a copy of the article, which has been bound into a volume with a kraft paper cover. There is a &quot;Shanghai Library Reproduction Fee Receipt&quot; in the volume, and the payment unit is filled with &quot;Shenjin&quot;. Next to it is Mr. Shen Xieyuan&#39;s ink note &quot;Printing on behalf of &quot;Research on Huang Pilie&quot;&quot;. On September 18, 1981, he copied 57 pages of A4 paper for a total cost of 14.25 yuan. It seemed very expensive at the time and the price was not small. It can be inferred from the time and the person who made the printing that Mr. Pan Jingzheng was referring to this immediately when he mentioned copying. It can be seen from the letter that Mr. Pan Jingzheng borrowed Luo&#39;s &quot;Academic Treatise on the Qing Dynasty&quot; from Yang Kangnian of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. Yang Kangnian is the same age as Mr. Shen Xieyuan and also graduated from Wuxi National College. However, he graduated a few years earlier and the two were not classmates. For his life, please refer to Ma Jun&#39;s &quot;Information&quot; published in &quot;The Paper·Private History&quot; on August 6, 2017. &quot;There is a Yang Kangnian in the room&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Soon after, Mr. Shen Xieyuan sent Mr. Pan Jingzheng and Mr. Qu Fengqi respectively the &quot;Yongfeng Township People&#39;s Travel Chronicles&quot; compiled by Gan Ru (Luo Jizu) published by Jiangsu People&#39;s Publishing House. Both elders believed in it. Thanks. Mr. Pan Jingzheng’s letter of thanks was written on November 24, 1981:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;My brother Xieyuan: To the letter, I also express my gratitude to you for the gift of &quot;Yongfeng Township People&#39;s Travel Chronicle&quot;.

Although the main text of Huang Pilie&#39;s poem on painting has been included in Volume 5 of the newly published &quot;Xipu Poems&quot; by Zhang Xiaolu, the title of &quot;Xipu Poems&quot; follows the previous one and is changed to &quot;Picture of Sitting Alone in Xishan&quot; For the ancient fragrance (Wuchen)&quot;. Omitting the word &quot;Sui Chao&quot; seems innocuous, but I don&#39;t know that these two words have a great influence on the reorganization of &quot;Huang Pilie Chronicle&quot;. There are two words &quot;Sui Chao&quot;, and the two poems are dated to the first day of the first month of the thirteenth year of Jiaqing (1808). There is no doubt that without these two words, they can only be attached to after this year. This is what Mr. Pan Jingzheng specifically mentioned in his letter. There is a saying that &quot;it can be traced over time&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 13 Oct 2023 23:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[人类文明史的两大基石：对偶家庭+市场经济的自然进化史]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258297]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-13 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In the field of public opinion, there are two abstract things that are discussed more. One is father, marriage and family; It is private property rights and market economy. Because these two constitute the two indispensable cornerstones of human civilization. Our ability as humans to enter a civilized society really depends on this. This article explores the origin and evolution of these two species from the perspectives of historical genetics and natural evolutionary history. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Father&quot; is a product of cultural construction&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Scholars in the pre-Qin era realized that in the distant &quot;ancient&quot; period, there was no such role as a father. &quot;Zhuangzi: Robber Zhi&quot; states that &quot;in the days of Shen Nong, the people knew their mothers but did not know their fathers.&quot; &quot;Lu&#39;s Spring and Autumn Annals: Reliance on the King&quot; said: &quot;In ancient times, there were no kings. The people lived in groups and knew each other.&quot; &quot;The mother does not know the father&quot;, that is, there was no father&#39;s role in the &quot;ancient&quot; period, so there was no stable dual family and the corresponding ethics between various relatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Professor Wu Fei said that in &quot;Etiquette·Mourning Clothes Biography&quot;, &quot;Shang Jun Shu·Kaisa&quot; and &quot;Lu Shi&quot;, as well as &quot;Jiao Shi Yi Lin&quot;, &quot;Baihu Tong·Hao&quot; and &quot;Lunheng&quot; in the Han Dynasty • Documents such as &quot;Qi Shi&quot; and &quot;He Tu Ting Zuo Fu&quot; all record the situation of &quot;knowing the mother but not knowing the father&quot; in ancient times (Wu Fei: &quot;The &quot;Disintegration&quot; of Human Relations: Anxiety about Family and Country in the Tradition of Moral Theory&quot;, Sanlian Bookstore , 2017, pp. 163–166). As a kind of collective memory, as well as field observations of &quot;savages&quot; in the pre-Qin era, we all realize that the role of fathers comes with the development of civilization. This is a consensus among people since the pre-Qin and Han Dynasties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Book of the Later Han Dynasty·Xunli Biography&quot; also noted from the perspective of field observation that the people of Luoyue in the south at that time &quot;had no wedding ceremony laws, and they had no suitable match due to their promiscuity and lust.&quot; This state of no stable duality obviously does not produce the role of a father (in a social and cultural sense). Through civilized discipline and education, biological men in nature are transformed into fathers who fulfill family and social responsibilities, thus forming a stable family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a stable family structure, bloodline inheritance is clearer, which can encourage fathers to be more actively involved in family and parenting responsibilities. With the father&#39;s active participation, the child&#39;s survival probability is higher, a stable parent-child relationship is formed, and the child can be with the child for a longer period of time. As a role in this pole of civilization, knowledge that requires longer education and accumulation, including hunting, martial arts, farming, and even a large amount of &quot;tacit knowledge&quot; such as managing a tribe, will be taught to students in the original &quot;family learning&quot; way. child. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To borrow the terminology of the Austrian school of economics, the emergence of the father&#39;s role and the dual family, as well as the imagination of the patrilineal ancestral community formed on this basis, are actually the product of super overcoming time preference. In an era without father figures, people consider the time dimension more briefly and often make judgments based on moments or short-term passions. The emergence of the role of fathers and the continuation of stable families and families have made the lines of time extremely long, and people&#39;s investment and gaming models also tend to consider the longer future. At this point, savings become more valuable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People saved grain and raised livestock instead of consuming it immediately. Through savings, children can obtain stable property inheritance. The continuation of private property allows people to &quot;have perseverance and perseverance&quot;, overcome time preference, and develop the virtue of accumulating the future. Whether it&#39;s working hard to save wealth, or doing good deeds to build a family&#39;s reputation, these are the foundations of civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The blood relationship between children and their mothers is natural and does not need to be demonstrated through cultural imagination, but the father is a product of cultural construction and imagination. To imagine community through &quot;patrilineal&quot; requires both the ability to imagine beyond time and abstract cultural construction. Through this model, people who were destined to forget each other in the past can be formed into an imaginary community, creating a close division of labor and collaboration. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Patriline and Aristocracy&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Once this kind of family organization is produced, it is destined to have an extremely powerful advantage among the scattered people everywhere who &quot;know their mother but not their father&quot;. Many archaeological materials can show that the first to establish a stable dual family order was the earliest aristocratic class. Not only did they create the means of imagining and sustaining community through the patriline, but they also created the earliest surnames. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;生&quot; in &quot;surname&quot; is a phonetic symbol. The ancient sound of the word &quot;surname&quot; is in the heart mugeng part, and the archaic sound of the word &quot;生&quot; is in the birth mothergeng part. The dental sounds overlap and the pronunciation is basically the same. Therefore, the word &quot;surname&quot; is not interpreted literally as &quot;born by a woman, representing the maternal line.&quot; The &quot;female&quot; is only used to label women in the paternal family, and &quot;surname&quot; is used for men in the family. The &quot;生&quot; in the surname is just a phonetic symbol, and the &quot;surname&quot; is just a function of distinguishing between patrilineal families with the same origin and non-intermarriage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The paternal surname creates a long family tree, which can connect different distant family branches, forming a greater ability to mobilize and cooperate. Therefore, it can be seen that early nobles often prohibited civilians from establishing surnames and did not allow them to establish family trees. For example, in ancient Hawaii, &quot;ordinary civilians were not allowed to record their lineages, and they were prohibited from approaching the supreme chief who was a professional person who recorded the noble lineage. This made the chief and the A sharp separation line was formed between civilians&quot; (Chen Chun: &quot;Exploring the Origins of Civilization and Early States: A Comparison of Chinese and Foreign Theories, Methods and Research&quot;, Shanghai Bookstore Press, 2007, p. 246). &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The aristocrats and civilians in the Shang Dynasty&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From an archaeological point of view, many people in the early days did not have stable paired families, and it was a common phenomenon to not know their mother but their father. For example, in tomb K82.5 at the Wajiaping site of Lintao of the Qijia Culture, an adult woman was buried with a baby under her breast, and the remains of a seven or eight-year-old child. The Qinghai Minhe Lajia F4 abandoned house burial tomb of the Qijia Culture also contains a single woman buried with a child in her arms (Li Xinwei: &quot;Rediscussing the Abandoned House Burial in Prehistoric Period&quot;, &quot;Archaeology&quot; 2007 Issue 5, No. Pages 50-56). These single mothers buried alone with their children are a vivid portrayal of the early era of &quot;knowing your mother but not knowing your father&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Xiajiadian Dadianzi tombs, there are no couples buried together, and mothers and young children are often buried together. For example, in tomb M30, a mother was buried with two young children, and in M205, a mother was buried with a child. Young children were buried together, M358 was buried with a mother and a child, M675 was buried with a mother and children, M787 was buried with a mother and two infants, and M1246 was buried with a young child (Institute of Archeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences: &quot;Dadianzi: Lower Xiajiadian Cultural Sites and Cemetery&quot; Excavation Report&quot;, Science Press, 1998, pp. 228-231). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the ancient sarcophagus burials of southwestern Yi, there are also tombs in which couples are buried together (Luo Kaiyu: &quot;Research on Sarcophagus Tombs in Western Sichuan and Yunnan and Eastern Tibet&quot;, &quot;Acta Archeology&quot;, Issue 4, 1992, p. 426 ). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After entering early civilization, nobles had stable couples buried together, but civilians still did not have stable couples buried together. For example, the couple&#39;s tombs M303 and M225 of Da Sikong in the Yin Ruins are side by side, 2 meters apart, and they are buried side by side. They are both from the fourth phase of the Yin Ruins, and there are rammed earth buildings on the upper floors (Anyang Working Team of the Institute of Archeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences: &quot;Excavation Report of Da Sikong M303 in the Yin Ruins &quot;, &quot;Acta Archeologica Sinica, Issue 3, 2008, p. 388&quot;), this noble tomb has a clear dual relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meng Xianwu pointed out that two-thirds of the tomb owners in Yinxu did not have a legal spouse during their lifetime. There were not many truly monogamous families. Most of them still lived in unstable couples and incest marriages, so they died. Afterwards, there were no exclusive spouses buried together (Meng Xianwu: &quot;A Review of the Excavations of Tombs in the Southern District of Yin Ruins&quot;, &quot;Central Plains Cultural Relics&quot; Issue 3, 1986, p. 80). Some scholars also pointed out that the phenomenon of &quot;burial in different caves&quot; for stable marriages is rare in the Yin Ruins. Throughout the pre-Qin period, single burials of men and women were the main burial method (Yang Baocheng: &quot;Research on Yin Ruins Culture&quot;, Wuhan University Press, 2002, pp. 80-83). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From these comprehensive points of view, the common people in the Shang Dynasty still mainly lived in a state without stable couple marriages, while the aristocracy showed a relatively stable couple family. In other words, aristocratic families in the Shang Dynasty had a clear role of &quot;father&quot;. The genealogy of the Shang king family in &quot;Historical Records·Yin Benji&quot;, as well as the genealogy of the Shang king family presented in the oracle bone inscriptions, and even other signs of noble genealogy found in the oracle bones, such as the famous &quot;Shang Sanjubing&quot; family tree inscription, are all It shows the ability of the aristocracy at that time to construct a community organization in the cultural imaginary way of patriarchy. Although the ties of the ancient clan society had not yet been completely disintegrated at that time, in the oracle bone inscriptions, the children of the Shang family referred to their biological father&#39;s brothers of the same generation, that is, uncles, as &quot;father&quot; and &quot;fathers&quot;. In addition, the Shang king and queen of Yinxu were also buried in different family cemeteries. &quot;This is probably related to the fact that the blood ties of the clan have not been completely disintegrated.&quot; (Anyang Working Team of the Institute of Archeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences: &quot;1976 Northwest Xiaotun, Anyang&quot; &quot;Excavation Briefing&quot;, &quot;Archaeology&quot;, Issue 4, 1987, page 374). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But no matter what, the Shang royal family and other aristocratic families can actually identify their respective biological fathers, and the later the father dies, the more the son succeeds, and the situation of brother&#39;s succession is decreasing. . Among the sacrifices, the sacrifices for the biological father are also more solemn. This also shows that the role of &quot;father&quot; in the culture of the royal family and aristocracy of the Shang Dynasty has become more and more clear, while in contrast is the vague civilian class, the mainstream living situation among which is still knowing one&#39;s mother but not knowing one&#39;s father. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Zhou Civilization and Confucius&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;By the Zhou Dynasty, the situation of the civilian class had not changed much, while the civilization level of the aristocratic class had further evolved and improved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, it was said that &quot;propriety is not inferior to common people&quot;, that is, the aristocratic class maintained the father and stable couple marriage family structure through civilized &quot;propriety&quot;, while the common class continued to know their mother and their father. For example, among the Jin tombs in Chengcun Village, Linyi, Shanxi, among the third-level civilian tombs, couples are rarely found buried in the same cave. &quot;This shows that the burial custom of couples being buried together in caves has not become popular among lower social classes&quot; (Institute of Archeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, etc.: &quot;Linyi Chengcun Cemetery&quot;, China Encyclopedia Press, 2003, p. 258 pages). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Scholars pointed out that compared with the Shang Dynasty, it was more common for couples of nobles in the Zhou Dynasty to be buried together in tombs (Zhang Mingdong: &quot;Inspection of Joint Tombs in the Shang and Zhou Dynasties&quot;, &quot;Ancient Civilization&quot; Volume 7, Cultural Relics Publishing Society, 2008, p. 185). This also shows that with the development of ritual and music civilization, the civilizational achievements carried by &quot;rituals&quot; more generally covered the families of the aristocratic class at that time. Stable and clear pair marriages, as well as the role of the father, were the further development of civilization in the Zhou Dynasty. important results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This background actually helps to understand more deeply why Confucius, who lost his father since childhood, had to hold a grand funeral ceremony at the Five Fathers Road after the death of his mother Yan Zheng, and then put her there. He was buried in Fangshan and buried with his father (&quot;Historical Records·Confucius Family&quot;). Because through this act, he can publicly show that he is the child of the aristocratic Kong family, not a &quot;savage&quot; class without a father, but a low-level nobleman with clear parents buried together in the tomb - a scholar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an orphan, Confucius never met his father. In fact, what has the greatest influence on him is precisely the maternal family with natural blood connections, that is, his grandfather Yan Xiang and his mother Yan Zheng are in these maternal families. Among the students of Confucius, there were the &quot;Eight Faces of Confucius&quot;, namely Yan Lu, Yan Hui, Yan Xing, Yan Gao, Yan Zu, Yan Zhimu, Yan Kuai, and Yan He. Among them, Yan Lu was probably his mother&#39;s nephew, that is, Confucius&#39;s cousin in his mother&#39;s family, and Yan Hui, as the son of Yan Lu, was Confucius&#39;s nephew in his mother&#39;s family. Confucius&#39; feelings for Yan Hui were often intertwined with the deep emotions of his mother&#39;s family, and Yan Hui also regarded Confucius as someone as close to him as his father. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of natural emotions, Confucius actually had the closest relationship with his mother&#39;s family, but he knew that the civilized class could not only know its &quot;quality&quot; but not its &quot;culture&quot;. &quot;You love his sheep and I love his etiquette.&quot; Although my father is far away, he is a symbol of etiquette and civilization. Without the symbol of father, he would remain at the level of knowing his mother and not knowing his father. Therefore, Confucius chose to publicly bury his mother and father together, declaring that he was the successor of Uncle Liang He, the official of Zouyi, and inherited and continued his father&#39;s &quot;Kong&quot; surname. The origin of the patrilineal imaginary community can therefore be traced back to the monarchs of the ancient Song Dynasty, and even the more distant Shang royal family, and all the way back to the emperor Ku and other figures in the ancient mythological era. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Confucius&#39; recognition of his ancestors opened a path to encourage the common people to imitate the nobility, to go beyond knowing their mother and not knowing their father, and to establish a clear father&#39;s family like the aristocrats. Confucius not only recruited a large number of elite children of civilians, but also spread aristocratic knowledge to them. Confucianism in later generations also encouraged civilians to learn etiquette, become civilized people, become qualified fathers, and imitate the nobles in establishing surnames, family trees, and family temples. The establishment and recognition of the father&#39;s symbol is an important springboard to civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Small communities and private property rights&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;By clarifying the role of the father and the cultural construction of the family, it provides an accumulated foundation for the development of communities and private property. The family is the foundation of private property rights, and private property rights are an important cornerstone of civilization. Only on this foundation does it make sense to save and develop for the future. It is on the basis of private property rights that the principle of &quot;differentiated love&quot; can bring into play the interactive effect of communities of different circles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Private property rights are not actually &quot;private&quot; as understood by Yang Zhu&#39;s atomic individuals. In a private property society, various forms of property sharing are actually practiced within families. The traditional primogeniture system in Western Europe retains the integrity of family property, although the second son can only receive an annuity provided by his elder brother, or even has no property and can only go out to explore the world. However, the family property is not &quot;privately owned&quot; by the atomic individual of the eldest son, but is the custodian between the ancestors and descendants of the blood community, so the property still belongs to the community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In contrast, the Chinese are more inclined to divide property. In addition to other scholars, according to the law of the Song Dynasty, &quot;a woman can marry half of a man&quot;, and daughters can also get the right to inherit family property. On the one hand, Confucians encourage the formation of clan communities with more levels of property distribution without dividing families, or by establishing family common property trusts such as &quot;Fan&#39;s Yizhuang&quot; and &quot;clan fields&quot;, &quot;sacrifice fields&quot; and &quot;school fields&quot; that are common in South China. &quot; and so on, maintaining various forms of common property of small communities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meaning of private property rights is mainly the defense mechanism that must be in place when facing public power representing the greater community. That is to say, the property rights of small communities such as families and families cannot be infringed on in the name of a large community or a society of strangers. In the face of public rights, private property rights are embodied as &quot;private&quot;, but within small communities, they are mostly represented as &quot;public&quot; with various tender feelings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even in the British Victorian era, which was criticized by some people, while the market economy and industrialization were highly developed, family values ​​remained strong, providing warmth and a haven to escape the cruelty of society. The song &quot;Home, Sweet Home&quot; written by John Howard Payne in 1822 has been popular in the English-speaking world for more than a hundred years. It sings: &quot;Home, home, sweet, sweet home! There is no place like home in the world. A better place”. The popularity of this song just shows that the high development of the market economy at that time did not destroy family values. On the contrary, it highlighted the &quot;privacy&quot; of the family as a small community and its positive role in protecting people. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The development of market economy&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the basis of private property rights, especially with the further development of the industrial and commercial economy, there is a need for rich exchanges and cooperation between strangers from all over the world. At this time, the market economy based on private property rights was nurtured and developed, and through various business models such as games and cooperation based on property rights, the lowest-cost method of cooperation between strangers in a complex society was realized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a free market economy, various small communities can divide labor and collaborate more effectively. As the market order expands, the number of groups it absorbs further increases, the division of labor is continuously refined, efficiency increases and costs decrease, forming a positive-sum game effect, and people benefit together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the collaboration model of the market economy, people have also learned to trade and collaborate in ways that go beyond traditional small communities. With the improvement of life and the abundance of commodities, more ordinary people have the opportunity to have access to the culture and art of past elites at low cost. Ludwig von Mises said: &quot;If an argument is needed, it is only necessary to point out how serious music has become popular in the past few decades, especially among those who are busy in business. That&#39;s enough. There has never been a time in history when art has been brought so close to the hearts of so many people&quot; ([Austrian] Ludwig von Mises: &quot;Socialism: Economic and Sociological Analysis&quot;, Translated by Wang Jianmin et al., China Social Sciences Press, 2008, p. 406). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, classical books were extremely expensive in China, and there were many records in the literature of &quot;poor families without books&quot;. According to the &quot;Book of the Northern Qi Dynasty: Du Bi&#39;s Biography&quot;, his grandfather was the governor of Huainan and his father was the county magistrate, but his family was still &quot;poor and without books&quot;. &quot;Yan&#39;s Family Instructions Encouraging Learning&quot; specifically emphasizes, &quot;If you can always keep hundreds of volumes of books, you will never be a villain for thousands of years.&quot; As long as the family can keep some precious books, there will not be a class decline, but it will be able to continue. Stay in the elite class. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, with the advent of the Song Dynasty, driven by the market economy, commercial book engraving began to rise and flourish, and a large number of high-end classical books began to enter the lives of ordinary people. Su Dongpo mentioned: &quot;When I met the old Confucian Mr. Yu, I said that when I was young, I wanted to get &quot;Historical Records&quot; and &quot;Han Shu&quot; but could not get them. Fortunately, I got them. I wrote them by myself and read them day and night, for fear of not being able to catch up. In recent years, people in the city have turned around. The books of hundreds of schools of thought were copied from each other, and thousands of pieces of paper were passed down every day. The books written by scholars were numerous and easy to produce&quot; (&quot;Li&#39;s Shanfang Collection Secretary&quot;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here, it is precisely because &quot;city people&quot; &quot;copied&quot; driven by commercial interests that caused the rapid popularity of classical books, and a large number of classical books entered the world of ordinary people. In the past in Europe, Stoic books and Rococo art were limited to a limited number of aristocratic elites and out of reach of ordinary civilians. However, with the development of market economy and industrialization, production costs have been greatly reduced, and ordinary workers can also hang a print of a Leonardo da Vinci or Van Gogh painting at home, or collect an industrially produced classical book. The market economy allows the aristocratic culture and elite rituals and music that were once aloof to enter the families and lives of ordinary people more efficiently, raising the average level of civilized society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that from the perspective of historical genetics and natural evolutionary history, the emergence of the stable dual family, the role of &quot;father&quot; (in a cultural sense) and the marriage system, as well as the emergence of the marriage system based on this Private property rights and market economy are the two cornerstones of a civilized society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 13 Oct 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[以色列外交人员家属遇袭，北京警方通报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258597]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-13 20:54:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;At about 14:00 on October 13, 2023, in front of a supermarket in Zuojiazhuang, Chaoyang District , a family member of an Israeli diplomat (male, 50 years old) was stabbed by a foreigner.

Japan has also high-profilely promoted its equipment in the United States and its allies. The role of logistics support. Foreign media said that the measures taken by Western military industrial groups are almost synchronized with the introduction of Japan&#39;s defense budget for the next five years, and they intend to prepare in advance within the framework of a quasi-alliance and cut the budget &quot;cake&quot; to the maximum extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, British Aerospace Systems has established close ties with Japan and plans to move its Asia-Pacific headquarters from Malaysia to Japan within the year to prepare to supply Patriot PAC-3 missile defense systems to Japan. France&#39;s Thales will cooperate with Japan&#39;s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to develop and produce equipment such as mine detectors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the combined influence of commercial and political factors, Japan suddenly became a &quot;hot potato&quot; sought after by arms dealers in the United States, Britain and France. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent times, the United States has frequently held offensive and defensive exercises with Japan, South Korea, and Australia, which has made the situation on the Korean Peninsula, Taiwan Strait, and South China Sea tense in Northeast Asia. Western arms dealers have a keen sense of smell. On the one hand, they are concerned about changes in the geopolitical situation, and on the other hand, they also fancy the business opportunities brought by Japan&#39;s substantial increase in defense spending. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some analysts believe that as tensions in Northeast Asia escalate and Japan increases its defense spending, the changes made by these arms giants in order to cooperate with Japan&#39;s major adjustments to its defense strategy indicate that Japan hopes to further achieve cooperation with the United States and Europe. &quot;Military binding&quot; supports its ambition to expand its military power. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Opportunity to take advantage of&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Western arms dealers have moved their Asia-Pacific headquarters to Japan, selling arms nearby, and launching &quot;face-to-face&quot; in-depth cooperation with Japan , a win-win situation can be achieved. From a deeper analysis, this is the reason why the United States uses Japan and Japan hopes to &quot;borrow ships to go to sea.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, the Biden administration has established many &quot;small circles&quot; in the hope of using, controlling and arming allies. Through the research and development of various advanced weapons and equipment, frequent military exercises with deterrence and actual combat significance, fighting &quot;proxy wars&quot;, testing the effectiveness of weapons and equipment and strategies and tactics, making huge fortunes by promoting arms, creating conflicts and conflicts, undermining regional stability, and maintaining it. In the global hegemonic position, it achieves the goal of &quot;killing many birds with one stone&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with Japan, South Korea, Australia, and the Philippines do not have advantages in military and technology. The United States&#39; selection and use of Japan is also &quot;a no-brainer.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as the Korean War and the Vietnam War, Western arms dealers had a history of moving their Asian defense contractor headquarters to Japan, allowing Japan to reap the benefits of its rapid economic rise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the outbreak of the Vietnam War, Japan&#39;s heavy industry restarted. As Japan is the rear area for US military war supplies, a large number of orders for military supplies continue to fall on Japan&#39;s military production lines. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is a long-established military industrial enterprise of Japanese manufacturers. It has a complete production line of F-4 fighter jets. The F-4 Phantom fighter jets it produces have played a huge role as the main fighter aircraft of the U.S. Navy and Air Force, helping the U.S. military win 277 wars. The victory helped the US military save some face in the Vietnam battlefield. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, the United States still wants to use Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the end of the Cold War, European arms dealers basically did not develop much. Therefore, European countries are also optimistic about Japan&#39;s funds and technology. At the same time, Japan also hopes to develop weapons and equipment instead of just relying on the United States. Before this, it was difficult for the United States to allow Japan to extend its olive branch to other countries in the research and development of weapons and equipment, especially heavy weapons and equipment. Now, the United States is opening up and hopes to arm Japan and allow Japan to provide assistance to the United States in the Western Pacific. assume more defensive obligations. Therefore, after the United States gave the green light, Japan and European countries moved forward in cooperation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, Japan’s security strategy has shifted from self-defense to auxiliary offense. At the end of 2022, Japan adjusted its security strategy. From the so-called self-defense in the past to the current auxiliary offense, it is expanding its military preparations in all aspects. Whether it is technology, funding, or procurement, Japan&#39;s own military production capacity alone is obviously not enough. . Therefore, Japan&#39;s turning its attention to European countries also reflects changes in its security strategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“There is money to be made”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On August 27, 2023, “Nikkei Asia” reported that “the world’s largest defense contractors Businesses are transferring their business operations in Asia to Japan, because in the face of the deteriorating security situation in East Asia, Japan is preparing to significantly increase defense expenses.&quot; Japan&#39;s &quot;business&quot; with Western arms dealers is conducive to dividing the cake and achieving strong alliances. , each takes what he needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From fiscal year 2023 to 2027, Japan’s total defense budget will reach 43 trillion yen, 1.6 times that of the previous five years. The latest defense budget finalized by the Japanese Ministry of Defense for 2024 has reached 7.7 trillion yen, equivalent to more than 380 billion yuan, once again setting a record high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, 900 billion yen will be used to purchase various ammunition and weapons and equipment, including new ship-to-air missiles and long-range cruise missiles. For example: the mass production costs of the &quot;performance-enhanced version&quot; of the Ground Self-Defense Force&#39;s Type 12 land-based anti-ship missile with a range extending to about 1,000 kilometers, and the production costs of &quot;high-speed gliding missiles&quot; used to defend islands such as the Southwest Islands. In addition, there are 64 billion yen for a new generation fighter aircraft project jointly carried out by Britain, Japan and Italy, and 75 billion yen for a new anti-missile interceptor jointly developed by the United States and Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2023, Japan held the largest international defense exhibition, attracting more than 250 arms companies from more than 60 countries and regions. European and American companies participating in the exhibition have shown great interest in the Japanese market. The Japanese government has planned to allocate more than 200 billion yen to purchase approximately 400 Tomahawk cruise missiles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan plans to deploy two Aegis system carrier ships by 2028, establish a new permanent &quot;unified headquarters&quot; in Tokyo Ichigaya, and uniformly command the three self-defense forces of land, sea and air; purchase long-range missiles and improve the Aegis system Carrier ships; develop new fields such as drones, space and the Internet, and ammunition support to improve sustained combat capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Kishida government&#39;s sharp increase in defense expenses has allowed European and American arms dealers to smell business opportunities. Behind the increase in Japan&#39;s military expenditures, it reflects that Japan and the United States have cooperated more frequently at the strategic and tactical levels in recent years. This is reflected in the fact that the US-Japan alliance is undergoing subtle and profound changes. The alliance system has gradually changed from the past &quot;American master and Japanese slave&quot;. Shifting to &quot;US-Japan coordination&quot; means that the United States needs Japan to step up to the forefront in a series of regional disputes, including regional hotspot issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The relocation of Western arms dealers to Japan may further fuel Japan&#39;s maritime ambitions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan has proposed that it should shift from the past &quot;marine defense governance&quot; to &quot;marine defense governance&quot;. Japan&#39;s ambition to become a maritime power is fully reflected in each phase of the basic marine plan. In addition, Japan plans to launch a series of maritime security assistance and increase strategic attention to Indo-Pacific countries, which will also bring certain complexity to the regional situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan’s ambition has always been demonstrated. Today, Japan plans to build the so-called largest warship after World War II - a modern version of the &quot;Yamato&quot; ship, which is 1.7 times the size of the U.S. Burke destroyer and exceeds the average tonnage of U.S. combat ships in terms of displacement and comprehensive combat power. This also shows that Japan can achieve great progress and development in its ocean strategy and offensive strategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of weapons and equipment configuration, the United States’ Standard 6 (SM-6) air defense missiles will be used on this ship, and Japan’s air defense and anti-missile capabilities will be further improved. If the &quot;Yamato&quot; ship is equipped with a ground-attack version of the Type 12 anti-ship missile, its range can reach 1,000 kilometers. Japan&#39;s future maritime platforms will have powerful ground attack capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan’s military spending is rising and it wants to expand its military preparations. Western arms dealers see business opportunities and flock to them. Fundamentally speaking, this will allow the United States to better utilize and control Japan with the help of arms dealers and maintain the United States in the &quot;Indo-Pacific&quot; regional” and even global hegemony. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Japan&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Arms Upgrading&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Japan has introduced the core business of the Western military industry and is also trying to intentionally introduce Western technology into its own arms production chain. middle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 28, the Japan Defense Equipment Agency issued the &quot;Defense Technology Guidelines 2023&quot;, reaffirming the strategy of &quot;building a nation through scientific and technological innovation&quot;, focusing on strengthening defense capabilities and developing weapons and equipment that are ahead of other countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the plan, within 5 to 10 years, Japan will produce weapons directly related to future combat methods, and after 10 years, it will realize the equipment of important technologies. Japan has listed 12 key technologies such as unmanned technology, new energy, new materials, instant communications and data processing as pillar technologies for the future defense industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Japanese military-industrial complex giant said that the entry of Western arms companies will increase the number of orders from small and medium-sized parts suppliers. There are currently 1,100 companies engaged in the production of fighter jet parts, 1,300 companies engaged in the production of tank parts, and 830 companies engaged in the production of warship parts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan has reached an agreement with the United Kingdom and Italy to jointly develop sixth-generation fighter aircraft, and recently jointly developed high-performance missiles with the United States for intercepting hypersonic weapons. Companies established in the UK, France, Italy and other countries plan to increase the number of employees and will mainly recruit local Japanese personnel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The American L3 Harris Technology Company is an aerospace company in the United States. It has begun negotiations with the Japanese Ministry of Defense on cooperation in drones and other fields, which provides a favorable opportunity for Japan to improve its military production capacity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the support of European and American arms dealers, Japan follows or coordinates with the United States and the West. During this sensitive period, Japan&#39;s defense budget is also increasing year by year. If this continues, Japan will fall into an endless cycle of arms race, which will bring serious danger to the regional situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another situation is that in order to make money, Western arms dealers may use the power of capital to bribe Japanese media, add fuel to the flames, and deliberately create conflicts. Western arms dealers have moved their Asian headquarters to Japan to cooperate with Japan in military research and development and sales. The Japanese government claims that the purchase of weapons and ammunition is a &quot;defensive measure.&quot; If the United States, the West and Japan intervene in hot geopolitical issues through arms exports, it will provoke conflicts and confrontations among relevant countries and make the situation in the Asia-Pacific region even more tense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, six European and American arms dealers have moved to Japan and signed an agreement to &quot;carry out large-scale arms modifications in Japan&quot;. They are suspected of shifting arms to prepare for war, making it easier for Japan to obtain offensive weapons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan plans to rely on its military cooperation with the United States to gradually realize its so-called military ambitions in the context of great power competition and the Indo-Pacific strategy. Once the devil of militarism is released from its cage, it will have , the impact on the world will further increase. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, the United States openly and covertly supports Japan to increase its defense budget. Japan&#39;s past &quot;exclusive defense&quot; has turned to &quot;active defense&quot; and it emphasizes the ability to attack enemy bases. The United States has adopted an attitude of encouragement and even support. Under this general premise, it is possible that the regional arms race will become more and more unfavorable, which is also caused by the United States and Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 13 Oct 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一观众从三楼看展坠亡，广东美术馆通报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258581]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-13 19:50:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Situation Briefing&lt;/strong>;&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of October 8, Ms. Yang, a visitor, visited the Guangdong Museum of Art and accidentally fell from Exhibition Hall 12 on the third floor of our museum to Exhibition Hall 6 on the second floor at around 11:50. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident, our library immediately activated the emergency plan and quickly dialed 120 emergency hotline and 110 police hotline.

The integrated development strategy of &quot;commercial and investment banking&quot; is progressing steadily, and the benefits of investment-loan linkage are gradually reflected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The strategic &quot;digital transformation&quot; of commercial banks has begun to shift from &quot;quantitative growth&quot; to &quot;qualitative improvement.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Loans tend to be in the manufacturing and technology industries&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center sorted out the 2023 interim results conferences, 2023 interim results conferences of 20 commercial banks The interim report and 2022 annual report found that 20 commercial banks all mentioned in the 2022 annual report the strategy of benefiting the real economy and providing financial support for manufacturing and national key areas. This strategy was emphasized again in the 2023 interim reports of each bank: each bank has proposed the goal of continuing to improve the quality and efficiency of serving the real economy in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the analysis of the distribution of corporate loan industries disclosed by 20 commercial banks in the 2022 interim report and the 2023 interim report, the above strategies mentioned by each bank in the 2022 annual report have achieved certain results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The year-on-year growth rates of corporate loan balances in the national key strategic fields of manufacturing and technology services were 25.02% and 64.35% respectively. Judging from the absolute value of corporate loan balances, in the first half of 2023, the loan balance of manufacturing companies in 20 commercial banks reached 15.86 trillion yuan, becoming the industry with the highest corporate loan balance, surpassing companies in the leasing and business services industry with 15.35 trillion yuan. Loan balance. The industry with the highest corporate loan balance in the first half of 2022 is the leasing and business services industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that within one year, the credit structure of commercial banks has changed from the original &quot;three pillars&quot; of leasing, real estate and manufacturing to a model dominated by manufacturing. This also echoes China’s current economic form in which the old triangular cycle of “real estate, infrastructure, and finance” is moving to the new triangular cycle of “technology, industry, and finance.” At the same time, this also reflects the current new phenomenon of bank funds flowing into the real economy and supporting the development of manufacturing, scientific research and technical service industries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/N9oJ5kvONawBpMQ3lLRpiKdDJJ8PVPk9WsUhQisL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1268&quot; height= &quot;1352&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/N9oJ5kvONawBpMQ3lLRpiKdDJJ8PVPk9WsUhQisL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254034&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Feng Qingchao/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main force that tilts credit towards the manufacturing industry is There are five major state-owned banks: industry, agriculture, China, construction, and diplomatic relations.

The three joint-stock banks Industrial Bank, China Merchants Bank and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank followed the five major state-owned banks with loan balances of manufacturing companies of 669.412 billion yuan, 549.976 billion yuan and 542.672 billion yuan respectively, higher than the Postal Savings Bank&#39;s manufacturing company loans of 495.732 billion yuan. Corporate loan balance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center also found that loans to companies in the scientific research and technical service industries have gradually become areas of concern for joint-stock banks and city commercial banks, which may be related to the misaligned competition strategy of state-owned banks. Among them, state-owned banks and some joint-stock banks did not disclose this balance. Among the city commercial banks, Bank of Shanghai did not disclose this balance in its 2022 interim report. However, from the 2022 annual report to the 2023 interim report, the bank disclosed it. the balance of this loan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In absolute terms, in the first half of 2023, Industrial Bank and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank had the highest balances, at 36.536 billion yuan and 32.944 billion yuan respectively. In terms of year-on-year growth rates, Bank of Nanjing and Bank of Beijing have the highest year-on-year growth rates, 92.67% and 83.11% respectively. It can be seen that joint-stock banks are the main lenders in this industry, while city commercial banks are gradually paying more and more attention to this field. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Investment business&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;becomes&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;an important growth point&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As the loan business turns, 20 The bank is developing its investment banking business, financial market business and “commercial investment banking” integration strategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center sorted out the 2023 interim reports of 20 banks, their interim results conferences and investor exchange meetings and found that most banks mentioned strengthening investment banking business and financial markets. sector and build an integrated development strategy of “commercial and investment banking”. From the analysis of the bank&#39;s revenue structure and asset structure in recent years, this strategy has achieved certain results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For financial investment business, the three indicators of investment income, net income from changes in fair value and net exchange income are particularly important, and the three indicators are highly correlated. In order to explore the actual benefits of various banks&#39; strengthening financial investment business strategies, researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center conducted statistics on the sum of the above three indicators as a proportion of revenue for 20 banks in the past three years. Statistics show that, regardless of whether it is a state-owned bank, a joint-stock bank or a city commercial bank, the ratio is on the rise, and the upward trend is the most obvious for city commercial banks. With traditional credit business unable to take advantage, city commercial banks are using investment business as a breakthrough point to expand their balance sheets. Take the Bank of Nanjing, which was shortlisted for China&#39;s systemically important banks for the first time on September 22, 2023, as an example. In the first half of 2023, the bank&#39;s three income indicators accounted for 32.15% of its revenue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/Ofc6345KnFX3DOnrAT9TLvvgUBlY7MNjsr8GXJAv.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;866&quot; height= &quot;796&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/Ofc6345KnFX3DOnrAT9TLvvgUBlY7MNjsr8GXJAv.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254033&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Feng Qingchao/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images .infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/HV5COF9Saq3kPHkt94b31busBbhVHgCZjn2Wv1V6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;866&quot; height=&quot;1852&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/23/10/13/HV5COF9Saq3kPHkt94b31busBbhVHgCZjn2Wv1V6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254032&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot; color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Feng Qingchao/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the above three income indicators are highly correlated with trading financial assets. In recent years, the proportion of trading financial assets to total assets of joint-stock banks and city commercial banks has also shown a growth trend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/RKL1YucI0TOTVGgvItL317nTxA6jNIjeJJ9bYVcj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;866&quot; height= &quot;796&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/RKL1YucI0TOTVGgvItL317nTxA6jNIjeJJ9bYVcj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254031&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Feng Qingchao/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the 2023 Interim Report of Bank of Nanjing, 2022 According to data from the interim report, 2022 annual report, 2021 annual report and 2020 annual report, at the end of June 2023, the end of December 2022 and the end of December 2021, the year-on-year growth rates of its trading financial assets were 40.32%, 39.28% and 77.41%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to conduct an in-depth analysis of the composition of each bank’s investment business, researchers from the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center sorted out the trading transactions disclosed in the 2023 interim reports of the five banks with the highest three income ratios among the 20 banks. Financial asset data. According to statistics, the largest trading financial assets of these banks are funds, followed by bonds or asset management trust plans. The funds invested by commercial banks are generally bond funds and currency funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By studying the types of bond funds invested by banks, researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center found that some banks’ bond investment strategies are to purchase fixed-term bond funds issued by the bank’s fund management subsidiaries. This strategy may have the effect of reducing bond investment costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take Industrial Bank as an example. According to the 2023 interim report disclosed by the fund products issued by Industrial Fund, the bank holds the Industrial Jiarong one-year regular open bond-type initiative issued by its subsidiary Industrial Fund Management Co., Ltd. The shares of securities investment funds and Industrial Jiafu one-year regular open bond-type sponsored securities investment funds are 99.87% and 99.88% respectively. According to Article 2 of the &quot;Notice of the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation on Certain Preferential Policies for Enterprise Income Tax&quot;, the income obtained by securities investment funds from the securities market includes income from price differences from buying and selling stocks and bonds, dividends and bonus income from equity, and income from bonds. Interest income and other income are not subject to corporate income tax for the time being. That is to say, compared with direct investment in financial bonds, banks can be exempted from paying 25% income tax if they invest indirectly in financial bonds through fixed-term debt funds, thus reducing investment costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the debt investment subjects of direct investment bonds, 10 of the 12 commercial banks (only 12 of the 20 commercial banks disclosed this data in their 2023 interim reports) maintained year-on-year growth increase. Among them, the two banks with year-on-year decreases were Bank of Nanjing and Ping An Bank. Although the amount of debt investment of these two banks decreased by 11.49% and 1.96% year-on-year, their trading financial assets increased by 40.32% and 17.81% year-on-year, and the proportion of funds and bonds among their trading financial assets was relatively high. The increase in the total amount of bonds in the debt base or trading financial assets is sufficient to cover the year-on-year decrease in the bond investment account. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In general, whether it is direct investment in bonds or indirect investment in bond funds, the financial investment business targets of various banks are mainly bonds. Judging from the overall scale and income level, joint-stock banks and city commercial banks are indeed still in the established strategy of strengthening investment business, and this strategy has also achieved certain results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The investment banking business of joint-stock banks and city commercial banks has also improved in the past two years. Take Industrial Bank and Bank of Nanjing as examples. According to the 2022 bond underwriting rankings of the wind database, Industrial Bank ranks 6th with a total underwriting amount of 947.746 billion yuan. The top five are Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of Communications. State-owned banks. Bank of Nanjing ranked 14th with 284.505 billion yuan. As of September 27, 2023, the 2023 bond underwriting rankings of the wind database show that Industrial Bank ranked fifth with a total underwriting amount of 798.374 billion yuan, surpassing Bank of Communications. Bank of Nanjing moved up one place to 13th place with a total underwriting amount of 273.62 billion yuan. Therefore, judging from the changes in the amount and ranking of the above two banks, the bond underwriting strength of joint-stock banks and city commercial banks has indeed improved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Analysis of the bank&#39;s bond underwriting business found that the bank&#39;s investment banking business strategy and credit business strategy are similar, and the overall flow of funds shows the flow of funds to national key areas such as science and technology innovation and green, achieving the effect of investment and loan linkage. Take Industrial Bank as an example. According to the bank&#39;s 2023 interim report, the scale of its underwriting of debt financing instruments for green non-financial enterprises reached 13.72 billion yuan, ranking first among joint-stock banks, and it has launched its first science and technology REITs business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of income, investment business is a more important growth point for various banks. Each bank may achieve the goal of stable balance sheet expansion through the strategy of continuing to increase the proportion of this business. However, researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center found that the above three income indicators are all related to trading financial assets, and the increase in trading financial assets will directly lead to an increase in risk-weighted assets, thereby reducing the core tier one capital adequacy ratio. Therefore, there is limited room to increase income through investment business. And&lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/contents/257314?source=147&amp;amp;source_1=238&quot;>;&lt;u>;&quot;The net profits of 20 banks account for more than 1/3 of A-shares,&quot; Wang&#39;s &quot;Fighting against the Increasing Differentiation of Interest Margin Pressure&quot; also mentioned that &quot;among the joint-stock banks, CITIC, Hua Xia and Zheshang Bank, their core tier one capital adequacy ratios are approaching regulatory red lines.&quot; Therefore, researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center suggested that while vigorously developing investment-loan linkage strategies, banks should also pay attention to the tier-1 capital adequacy ratio and avoid blindly expanding their balance sheets, which could lead to regulatory red lines. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Abandon quantitative growth&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;, &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Digital transformation&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Transform into quality&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;While the linkage effect of investment and lending has emerged, the attitudes of various banks towards financial technology have changed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After sorting out the 2023 interim reports, interim results conferences and financial technology job recruitment information of 20 banks, researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center found that in terms of digital transformation strategies, compared with previous years, funding And with the increase in human investment, all industries will pay more attention to quality presentation in 2023. According to China Financial News Network, judging from the recruitment situation in the autumn of 2023, the financial technology positions of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China have experienced a &quot;reduction in recruitment&quot; for the first time. According to data from the 2022 annual reports of the four major state-owned banks, the four banks of &quot;Industry, Agriculture, China, and Construction&quot; each have more than 10,000 technology employees, and the number of employees in financial technology positions has approached &quot;saturation.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some banks’ capital investment in the financial technology field is also not as strong as in previous years. Among the 20 banks, only China Merchants Bank and Everbright Bank disclosed information technology investment data in the 2023 interim report, which were 5.206 billion yuan and 2.043 billion yuan respectively, a year-on-year decrease of 2.87% and 4.44%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in terms of quality improvement, various banks have provided many specific cases on the effectiveness of digital transformation. For example, ICBC completed the feasibility assessment of the application of quantum technology in scenarios such as bond investment portfolios and option pricing based on quantum simulators; China Merchants Bank used models to automatically review loans, and &quot;Zhaoqidai&quot; realized the entire process of corporate loans online, and customers The fastest time from application to loan disbursement is 0.5 working days; Ningbo Bank takes advantage of WeChat banking in reaching customers and product promotion, enriching voice, video and other service methods to provide customers with a more efficient and simpler financial service experience business process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can also be found through vertical quantitative comparison that compared with 2022, various banks have achieved more actual results in the field of financial technology and digital transformation. For example, as of the end of June 2023, ICBC has deepened the construction of an enterprise-level corporate digital operation and management platform, and the platform has reached more than 1.6 million customers; China Merchants Bank&#39;s &quot;AI Tips&quot; has served 11.7288 million users, a year-on-year increase of 140.84%; Bank of Beijing The &quot;Intelligent Strategy&quot; retail digital operation system has launched more than 1,200 strategies, reaching more than 170 million customers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Through quantitative horizontal comparison, it can be seen that ICBC’s digital transformation and technological capabilities are the best among the 20 banks. In terms of financial technology, as of the end of June 2023, ICBC had 1,878 new public patents, and the cumulative number of patent authorizations was 2,941, ranking first among its peers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The effects of technologies in various industries empowering the field of risk control are also more significant than before. Take the digitally empowered inclusive finance risk control system disclosed in ICBC’s 2023 interim report as an example. The report describes in detail the entire process of digital access, intelligent risk control, and online and offline cross-validation. Its non-performing rate has increased year-on-year. The decline also demonstrates the benefits of digital transformation. Among them, &lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/contents/257314?source=147&amp;amp;source_1=238&quot;>;&lt;u>;&quot;The net profits of 20 banks account for more than 1/3 of A-shares,&quot; &quot;Profit King&quot; Fights Increasing Differentiation Pressure on Interest Margins&quot; &lt;/u>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>; has stated that &quot;in the first half of 2023, the non-performing loan ratios of 20 banks have almost all declined, and only Ping An Bank&#39;s non-performing loan ratio has increased. 1 BP.&quot; Bank of Beijing, whose non-performing ratio has dropped by 30 BP year-on-year, even emphasized the construction of a unified risk control platform in the digital transformation section of its official report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen from the above analysis that technology-enabled risk control, mobile banking and technology-enhanced investment strategies have achieved certain results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the road to digital transformation is still long. Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center recently found through actual measurements of different bank counter services and surveys of practitioners in different industries that most bank counter services still take a long time to process. Although robots and intelligent counters are placed at the entrance of every bank, in terms of customer experience, the robots are more like decorations, and the services that the intelligent counters can handle are also quite limited. The business process at the manual counter is quite complicated, and the waiting time for bank staff to operate is also long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center believe that compared to the past, the current application of information technology in online business has been more extensive and is supported by actual data. If banks can increase the application of technology in the field of over-the-counter services, such as moving more over-the-counter services online, it may be able to reduce labor costs to a great extent and improve efficiency at the same time. In fact, some banks are already trying to take this step. Postal Savings Bank disclosed in its 2023 interim report that it is exploring digital operations and innovatively launching a &quot;cloud cabinet&quot; intensive operation model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 13 Oct 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
