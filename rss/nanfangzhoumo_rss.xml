According to statistics, Xinhua&#39;s printing and printing industry has captured more than 95% and 70% of the market share in the national universities and the national printing and printing industry respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Not only Lanzhou Ramen and Shaxian Snacks have opened stores across the country, but also Xinhuaren’s Wenyin Shop. Today, Xinhua Printing Industry has opened more than 150,000 picture and text express printing shops, more than 3,000 copier remanufacturing and distribution companies, and more than 2,000 consumable production and sales companies in more than 660 cities across the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The reason why Xinhua Wenyin has swept the country has to start with the small town of Yangxi. Many years ago, a Peking University doctoral thesis &quot;The Life History of Xinhua Copying Industry&quot; became popular on the Internet, which revealed the secret of how Xinhua people turned a piece of graphics into a 100-billion-dollar industry through &quot;teaching and mentoring&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This small town located in a corner has a tradition of &quot;supplementing agriculture with technology&quot; since ancient times. Yangxi people accidentally learned mechanical typewriter repair technology, then united a group of repair technicians to go nationwide, and then relied on repair technology to develop the second-hand copier business, gradually realizing iterative upgrades in the text and printing industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the complete industrial chain of typing, copying, drawing, printing, printing equipment and remanufacturing, and consumable manufacturing and operation, more than 300,000 people Xinhua printing technicians have traveled all over the country. Under the impact of &quot;paperless office&quot;, Xinhua printing industry is still booming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From &quot;introduced manufacturing&quot; to &quot;independent intelligent manufacturing&quot;, Xinhua Wenyin is getting rid of the shackles and building the world&#39;s business card of &quot;Xinhua Wenyin&quot;. Today, independent intellectual property products such as high-speed inkjet blueprint machines are accelerating industry changes; Xinhua Printing has gone abroad and has settled its printing products in more than 80 countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Mobile phone cases, stationery, mouse pads, background walls... These DIY personalized printings that are popular among young people have also become the &quot;get rich&quot; for Xinhua Wenyin people &quot;High-gloss&quot;, new printing products represented by Meow Meow Machine, 3D printing products, etc. have created more possibilities for Xinhua Printing. Today, Xinhua, known as the &quot;Chinese Capital of Printing and Printing&quot;, is still domineeringly declaring its own &quot;printing&quot; strength. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Today, &quot;Know&quot; will take you to learn about the &quot;Hunan&quot; font size business that &quot;dominates&quot; print shops across the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/de5bb231c0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/de5bb231c0.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251291&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/9a25dd92da.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440 &quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/9a25dd92da.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251292&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot; &quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/e7e6a11306.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot; //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/e7e6a11306.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251293&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http: //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/bcee885338.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/bcee885338.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251294&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/54098d0c52.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/09/20/54098d0c52.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251295&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/09/20/fa591a1c31.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/ 20/fa591a1c31.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251296&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 21:25:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[九华山：气象万千的水墨丹青丨眼睛在旅游⑦]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257609]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[在土耳其， 探访亚美尼亚的古都丨古国多少事⑥]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257362]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/ 10/23/q1dtyKAs2YKSFdfv9IKNw2fhrYaiFkUwOMWBNhNQ.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/10/23/q1dtyKAs2YKSFdfv9IKNw2fhrYaiFkUwOM WBNhNQ. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;116060&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Looking at the ancient city of Ani from a distance, there are three obvious buildings from front to back: a mosque, Cathedral, Church of the Savior. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;A European-style town in the Islamic world&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Kars is the Silk Road A quite alternative city in the western section. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After traveling in Pakistan and Iran for more than a month, I have already become accustomed to the mountains and the Gobi, the minaret and the Grand Bazaar, the call of dawn and dusk with black gauze and white hats, the lively markets and winding alleys... Enter Although the landscape in eastern Turkey changed to gentle slopes and the language changed to Turkic and Kurdish, the strong imprint of Islamic civilization has not weakened at all. But when you come to the northeastern border town of Karls, the cool and elegant cityscape, the streets with a checkerboard structure, the neat and straight stone roads, and even the bank branches shining warmly in the bleak autumn wind make people suddenly feel like they have traveled to a Nordic town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The unusual origin of Kars comes from: it was occupied by Tsarist Russia for 40 years from 1878, and was planned, built and managed in a European style. of Soviet Russia was ceded to Turkey. Before that, Kars was the capital of the middle Bagratid dynasty. It was successively occupied by the Byzantines, Seljuks, Mongols and Turks in the more than 800 years after the fall of the dynasty. The Bagratid Dynasty was a mini-version established by the only remaining nobles who took advantage of the gap between the Byzantine Empire and the Arab Empire after the once vast Kingdom of Armenia, which controlled hundreds of thousands of people, was divided by the Roman Empire and the Parthian Empire. The Armenian country has been a country for 160 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are no Armenians in Kars today, but just a hundred years ago, 84.1% of the population here was Armenian. Because the Tsarist Russian government was relatively friendly to Armenians, people from Western Armenia (generally referring to the former Armenian territory in Turkey, corresponding to Eastern Armenia, which is now the Republic of Armenia and part of Azerbaijan) who suffered discrimination and abuse from the Ottoman Turkish Empire at that time migrated to Kars , especially during World War I, the Ottoman Turkish Empire implemented a genocidal policy against the Armenians in its territory, resulting in the deaths of 1 million to 1.5 million Armenians. This is known as the Armenian Genocide in history, and even prompted Western Armenians to flee to Kars for refuge. Unfortunately, the good times did not last long. After Soviet Russia ceded Kars to Turkey, the Armenians here had to embark on a journey of survival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My companions and I found a small hotel to stay in - the hotel sign on Turkey Street is easy to recognize, written as otel, which comes from the French word hotel with a silent h - we were preparing to take advantage of the sun yet. Go down the mountain to see the landmark here, the Seljuk Castle built in the 12th century AD, and Celil, the famous old fox of Kars, comes to visit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Turkey is a big tourist country, but tourists mainly go to the Aegean coast in the west, the Mediterranean coast in the south and Cappadocia in the center. Even the quiet and elegant Black Sea coast in the north is rarely visited. Not to mention eastern Turkey, which is adjacent to &quot;high-risk areas&quot; such as Syria, Iraq, Iran and the Caucasus. The rare few who make the long journey to Kars are undoubtedly to have a look at the ruins of Ani, and Celil, who has a keen sense of smell, specializes in these people&#39;s business. He can track every first-time tourist, and even the backpackers who spend a lot of money can be killed by him before they know the east, west, north, and south. Having said that, the number of tourists here is limited and it cannot support more tourism operators. The tourism transportation in Ani is not developed, so Celil has become an unavoidable broker for tourists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Celil speaks fluent English, and this skill alone is a talent that can only be encountered within a few hundred miles. He was going to personally take a group to Ani the next day, and he had no control over the two of us. He just wanted to find a car for us and a young man from Melbourne we met on the road to go to Ani, and charged 20 lire per person - I asked about the price for chartered cars, which was 40 lire. The Turkish lira has experienced a 50% plunge in 2018 and a 20% depreciation since the COVID-19 epidemic this year. Now it is only 85 cents in exchange for RMB, but at that time, 1 lira could be exchanged for more than five yuan. This chartered trip was equivalent to three hundred yuan. For the first time, Celil took a third of it - only after we were on the road did we learn that Celil actually asked the simple Melbourne boy for 5 liras more. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ten years later, another Chinese tourist came to Karls, and he also got three people to charter Celil’s car to Ani. Celil has entered middle age from a young man, and has worked hard to innovate. He originally negotiated a charter price of 100 lire, but after the journey, he charged 50 lire per person. He actually wanted to ask the simple German guy for another 50 lire tip. He was evaluated as &quot;Malicious greed&quot; - I accidentally read this on the Internet and couldn&#39;t help laughing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/10/22/b2DP79UXKCZMTxHbuShKPAOxXNV7e2wIj5lSlXk8.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/10/22/b2DP79UXKCZMTxHbuShKPAOxXNV7e2wIj5lSlXk8.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;115783&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Turkish breakfast in the European-style small town of Karls. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;A dynasty growing in the cracks&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Early the next morning, sitting In a small restaurant full of locals, I ate a basket of bread with a large bowl of soup made from mutton hamstrings - this is the Turkish version of Runan mutton soup breakfast, and then drove to the ancient capital Ani, 45 kilometers away. This place is located on the Armenian Plateau that connects the Iranian Plateau and the Anatolian Plateau. Along the way is still the typical temperate grassland in Central Asia. The herdsmen are stacking hay into pyramids five or six people high to prepare for the winter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ani, the destination of this trip, is the fourth and last capital of the Bagratid dynasty. It was the capital for the longest time, lasting 84 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Speaking of the revival of the Bagratid dynasty in Armenia, Robert I, who led Scotland to regain its independence, is comparable to Robert I, who was capricious and devoted to family interests in the movie &quot;Brave Heart&quot;. The English invaders betrayed the leader of the rebellion, William Wallace, and then rebelled against the independent Scottish nobleman Robert the Bruce. This man was truly a generational hero known as &quot;Braveheart&quot; in history. Ashote I, the founding monarch of the Bagratid dynasty, was also such a figure. After the fall of the Kingdom of Armenia, the Romans and Persians fought on its territory for many years and were severely weakened. As a result, the newly rising Arabs came from behind and became the conquerors of the Armenian Plateau. In 705 AD, the Arab governor sent by the White-coated Food (Umayyad Dynasty) almost killed all the remaining Armenian nobles, and the Bagratid family survived; more than 40 years later, the White-Coated Food changed dynasties and became the Black-Coated Food (Abbasid Dynasty), sent troops to bloody suppress the uprising launched by the Armenians who took advantage of the chaos, eradicated the local civil resistance forces, and the Bagratid family, who had long been friends with the black-clad Caliphate, once again survived, and they have been together ever since. With its strong support, it became the most powerful political and military force on the Armenian Plateau, and also became a local force that foreign Arab rulers must rely on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was at this time that Ashuote I succeeded him as the family governor. On the one hand, the Arab Caliph supported him to neutralize the surrounding separatist forces and became the King of Armenia, hoping to use him to calm down the instability in the Caucasus Mountains so that he could concentrate on dealing with the Byzantine Empire to the west; on the other hand, the Byzantine Emperor Basil I hoped to win over the Armenian nation. They shared the belief in the Kingdom of God, thus forming a siege on the Black Era from the northern flank; on the other hand, Ashot I not only wanted to use the Byzantines to drive away the Arabs, but was also worried that the Byzantine Empire, which believed in Orthodox Christianity, would force the Armenian Apostolic Church to convert. , thereby threatening the legitimacy of his regime. Therefore, Asot I strictly adhered to the principle of keeping a low profile and double-dealing throughout his life. At the same time, he formed alliances with Byzantium and Arabia and watched the two empires fight in front of the Caucasus Mountains. He devoted himself to making Armenia bigger and stronger, and did not let the Arabs He had time to intervene in his own country&#39;s affairs and prevented the Byzantines from obtaining practical benefits from the Caucasus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first capital of Ashote I after the founding of the country was Bagaran, the base of the Bagratid family. After his son ascended the throne, he moved the capital to Shirakavan. Both places are on the east bank of the Aras River. Today, due to geopolitical changes, the Aras River is the boundary river between Armenia, Turkey, and Iran. More than a thousand years ago, it was the mother river of Armenia. The Bagratid dynasty located its first two capitals on the east bank of the Arras River in order to use the defensive function of the river to keep foreign enemies west of the river. When Abbas, the grandson of Asjot I, came to the throne and the Bagratid dynasty became more powerful, it moved its capital to Kars west of the Aras River to better protect the trade route from the Caucasus to the Black Sea and resist Byzantine aggression. Encroaching eastward. After Abbas&#39;s son Ashot III came to the throne, he moved the capital to Ani on the west bank of the Arras River. It never moved the capital again until the demise of the dynasty in 1045 AD. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/10/23/bPBS8zxe6WU5Oh5XfTtuJ7wW3oemOJsmjEPCCkip.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;638&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/10/23/bPBS8zxe6WU5Oh5XfTtuJ7wW3oemOJsmjEPCCkip.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;116062&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Haystacks in Armenia&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian./Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Civilized Transfer Station&lt; /h3>; &lt;p>;The Kingdom of Armenia was the first Christian country in the world. After the resurgence, the Bagratid Dynasty continued the status of the Armenian Apostolic Church as the state religion and consolidated the legitimacy of its regime by sending large amounts of donations to the church. As a result of this approach, the ancient capital Ani was once dotted with churches and was known as the &quot;City of One Thousand and One Churches&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another title of Ani is the &quot;City of Forty Gates&quot;, which refers to its vast area and abundant business travel. But today there is only one north gate left in Ani. The later conquerors, the Seljuqs, built an outer wall around the north gate to form a corridor-like urn city, which improved the defensive function of the city gate. This only remaining city gate was named after the Seljuk Sultan Arslan who captured Ani in 1064, and was called the Gate of Arslan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to defend the city of Ani with only one gate left? Out of the way. The terrain of Ani is very similar to the Jiaohe Ancient City in Turpan. It is located on a platform formed by three deep rivers. There are almost dry deep valleys to the east and west, and the steep Alas Valley to the south, forming a natural moat. Only the north has a road leading to the outside world. In the era of cold weapons, it was really a great pass that was easy to defend but difficult to attack. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ani is located at the crossroads of the Caucasus Mountains to the south, Persia to the west, Mesopotamia to the north and Asia Minor to the east. Its location is very important. In addition, it is adjacent to the Arras Valley and has abundant water resources. The trade routes in the Volga River Basin that crossed the Caucasus Mountains merged into the junction of the Silk Road, thus witnessing the rise and fall of ancient civilizations one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the Armenians, the Byzantines attacked Ani three times in history until they captured the city in 1045. Afterwards, Ani became an important eastern town in the Byzantine Empire equivalent to the capital Constantinople. , there were 100,000 residents living on this platform in its heyday, marking the Caucasus entered its commercial heyday under Byzantine rule. Unfortunately, the good times did not last long. With the decline of Arab power in Central Asia, the Seljuqs rose rapidly and occupied the ecological niche of the Arabs. They then defeated the bloated Byzantine army in the west and captured Ani in 1064, starting from there. Asia Minor turned the Caucasus into its own backyard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Seljuks left, Ani was successively occupied by the Georgians and Kurds. It was not until 1239 that the short-lived Mongols conquered Ani. This was the last time the city was captured—— A major earthquake 80 years later destroyed most of the buildings in the city, forming the ruins we see today. In addition, the Ottoman Turkish Empire straddled the east coast of the Mediterranean and the Balkan Peninsula, cutting off the Silk Road between Western Europe and East Asia. As a result, Ani&#39;s status as a trade center no longer existed and it declined rapidly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Ottoman Turkish Empire gradually declined in the 19th century, Ani and Kars fell into the hands of Tsarist Russia for a time, and only returned to Turkish hands after World War I. During the Cold War era, this was the border between the Warsaw Pact and NATO in Asia. Once the Soviet armored forces broke out of the Caucasus mountains, they would flood into the Anatolian Plateau. This has become Turkey&#39;s nightmare for many years. Both Turkey and the Soviet Union stationed heavy troops along the Arras Valley, and Ani was under military control for 40 years as an important border defense area. It was not until the collapse of the Soviet Union, Armenia&#39;s independence, and the disappearance of the military threat faced by Turkey that control policies were relaxed. But at first, tourists still needed to apply in advance before entering the ancient city of Ani, just like my country&#39;s border permit system, which was canceled after Erdogan came to power in 2003. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/10/23/M7uFh32a7tGHPnbFFt1BeaF1sF8obd5ei15Qulmt.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/10/23/M7uFh32a7tGHPnbFFt1BeaF1sF8obd5ei15Qulmt.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;116063&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The ruins of the ancient city of Ani can overlook the rocky village on the opposite cliff, giving you a sense of Cappadocia. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;The city of one thousand and one churches&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The ancient city of Ani has been abandoned for several years For centuries, the landform has basically returned to its original appearance in ancient times. Only a dozen of the most magnificent and solid ancient buildings remain, which have withstood the test of time and natural disasters and stand quietly in the grass, silently displaying the civilizations left by different eras. imprint. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;St. Gregory was the founder of the Armenian Apostolic Church. He was imprisoned in a dungeon for 13 years by King Tiridates III of Armenia. Finally, he used miracles to convert the king and established the world&#39;s first Christian country. , so he is regarded as the patron saint by the Armenians. There are three churches named after St. Gregory in Ani. Among them, the one near the north gate is also called Abughamrents. It was built in 994 AD and has a conical roof and 12 walls on the facade. The niche is a typical Armenian architectural style and is very eye-catching on the withered yellow grassland. From here, you can overlook the rocky villages on the opposite cliff to the west, giving you a sense of Cappadocia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another Armenian-style church is the Church of Redeemer. Although it is small in size, it is the most fascinating place in the city of Ani. This church was built between 1034 and 1036 AD to store the &quot;True Cross&quot; gifted by the Byzantine Empire, which is the legendary fragment of the cross that crucified Jesus Christ. The &quot;True Cross&quot; is like the Buddha&#39;s relic in Buddhism. It is not uncommon in the Christian world, and its authenticity is doubtful. The Church of Our Savior is fascinating because it has stood for more than 900 years and has survived wars and earthquakes. It is the only well-preserved ancient building in the entire ancient city of Ani. However, it was accidentally struck by lightning in 1957, leaving only half of the outer wall. Standing among the rubble with the vault, it looks like a warrior whose skin has been eroded but whose skeleton is erect, showing a unique desolate beauty in this thousand-year-old ruins. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/10/23/AnOBp9f1cSPaiSZ0p20VdlU05RZgqZof8D9x9qNt.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/10/23/AnOBp9f1cSPaiSZ0p20VdlU05RZgqZof8D9x9qNt.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;116064&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Church of the Saviour&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most magnificent church in Ani is The Byzantine-style Ani Cathedral was designed by Trdat Mendet, the master architect who presided over the reconstruction of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. Construction started in 987 AD and took 24 years to complete. This cathedral looks inconspicuous from a distance, like a magnificent mansion. When you walk into the church and take a closer look, you will find that it combines grandeur and exquisiteness: the grandeur is reflected in the tall red and black basalt columns inside - Byzantine style architecture. The main purpose of the architect is to use height to create a gap in a limited space, so that believers will feel awe; the exquisiteness is reflected in the meticulous carvings everywhere in the church, making believers sigh for the perfection of heaven and earth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like Hagia Sophia, Ani Cathedral was converted into a mosque by the Seljuq conquerors who believed in Islam, named &quot;Victory&quot;. After the Seljuks left, the Georgians and Armenians turned it back into a church, and after the Turks came, they turned it into a mosque again... After several rounds of sawing, the vault, which was the soul of the Byzantine church building, collapsed, and so No one cares about this cathedral anymore, and it stands alone overlooking the rushing Aras river below. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/10/23/lfbdpmz14PYzPWK93qkeod9h4xfYb7bYbF7rJJBv.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/10/23/lfbdpmz14PYzPWK93qkeod9h4xfYb7bYbF7rJJBv.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;116065&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Cathedral&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another St. Gregory the Great in the west of the city The church was also built by Trdat Mendet, which makes me suspect that this is a character similar to the water conservancy engineer Zheng Guo at the end of the Warring States Period, who was sent by the Byzantine Empire to consume the national power of the Bagratid Dynasty. Its vault design is exactly the same as that of Hagia Sophia. Unfortunately, it collapsed not long after it was built, and now only a huge circular base and a pile of rubble remain. On its northeast side is a Georgian church, and on its east side is the Zoroastrian temple left by the Persians, which is the oldest architectural remains in the entire city of Ani. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third St. Gregory the Great Church in Ani was built in 1215 and was funded by a wealthy Armenian businessman. It witnessed the final glory of Ani. Just over twenty years later, the Mongols came over, slaughtered all the civilians, and turned the castle into a camp. Later Turks called this church Resimli Kilise, which means mural church. It is hidden halfway up the valley and is not easily visible from the mesa. There are long Armenian inscriptions on the outer wall of the church, and a large number of early Christian murals are preserved inside. The lines are elegant and smooth, and there is no dullness in such religious propaganda paintings of the same period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/10/23/E4yrX2ktkjLLaMKgpJm3Usst2dieC7leGjLqgIt2.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/10/23/E4yrX2ktkjLLaMKgpJm3Usst2dieC7leGjLqgIt2.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;116066&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Fresco church&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http:/ /images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/10/23/4LIZWpuDi030WkfHTln9fYPMfPNCJBPE0YEv4FpA.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com /cms/medias/image/20/10/23/4LIZWpuDi030WkfHTln9fYPMfPNCJBPE0YEv4FpA.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;116067&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Mural church preservation The murals &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, let’s talk about the marks left by the Seljuks. The first is the Church of Holy Apostles built by the Armenians. The Seljuks actually opened a new arch in it, which is transparent from north to south, and turned into a large car shop for resting caravans. But because of this, the church escaped the war and fire, and its internal structure and decoration are well preserved. Its rib arches, carvings and mosaics can still be clearly seen today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a red-brown building on the cliff south of the ancient city. From a distance, it looks like a rectangular factory building with a large chimney. The architectural style is very different from the surrounding Armenian or Byzantine churches, but the color scheme is similar. This is actually the first mosque in Turkish history. It was built by the Seljuqs in 1072. It adopts the Armenian red and black color scheme. The &quot;big chimney&quot; is a minaret, but the top of the tower has collapsed. . The mosque overlooks the Arras Valley. There is the Monastery of Our Lady and the Broken Bridge at the bottom of the valley. Armenia is on the other side of the river. Since Turkey and Armenia are feuding countries, they have not yet established diplomatic relations, and the borders between the two countries are naturally closed to each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/10/23/B8ZQc7lMGZjtNY5ZNJBgRpcHaIH7tvYTzzZCJw8j.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/10/23/B8ZQc7lMGZjtNY5ZNJBgRpcHaIH7tvYTzzZCJw8j.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;116068&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Mosque&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ancient city of Ani was listed as a A world cultural heritage, it is not only a witness to Armenia’s long civilization, but also a shining pearl on the Silk Road. Austrian art historian Josef Strzygowski once commented on Ani: Only the genius who built Hagia Sophia (Byzantium) and St. Peter&#39;s Basilica (Rome) can truly understand the importance of the Armenian pioneers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unfortunately, blocked by ethnic hatred and geopolitics, Armenians are only separated from this thousand-year-old capital by a river, but they cannot visit it. Coincidentally, Mount Ararat, the spiritual totem of Armenian civilization, has also been assigned to Turkey. Armenians can only look up from outside the border at the foot of this perfect cone-shaped volcano. Although they are close at hand, they cannot take a step closer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ani and Ararat are the cultural roots of the Armenian nation that are elusive! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[关注 | 2023诺贝尔奖揭晓]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258135]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 18:40:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>; Starting from October 2, the list of 2023 Nobel Prize winners will be announced one after another.

Many people have worked for more than ten years and are in the prime of life, facing workplace pressure and even unemployment crises. There are many job opportunities in the market for fresh graduates, and civil service positions are also fully open to them, with preferential admissions. Even in the civil service examination itself, fresh graduates have an advantage. A large number of young people are pouring into the public service system, and middle-aged people are under pressure from the workplace, which they think is unreasonable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Middle-aged people are just a little older, but when it comes to being energetic and hard-working, they are not inferior to young people in any of them. When it comes to work experience and communication and coordination, the abilities of middle-aged people in their thirties are far beyond that of fresh graduates who have just left school. It has to be said that this complaint is justified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The civil service system has always favored fresh graduates, roughly because college students are highly educated, learn new things quickly, and have strong plasticity. This is true in an era when college students are scarce. But nowadays, most middle-aged people are college students, and their education level and work ability are fully qualified. The reason in the past is no longer tenable. In fact, the most important reason is: to relieve employment pressure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every year during the college graduation season, college students rush into the market and the short-term employment pressure is very high. Recruit civil servants and &quot;leave&quot; jobs to them. In years of economic downturn, we even hesitate to expand recruitment to relieve employment pressure. This seems to be an impeccable arrangement that kills two birds with one stone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, recruiting college students for civil servants does not really solve the employment problem, because civil servants rely on taxes to support them. To create wealth and tax revenue, we have to rely on enterprise production and operation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of actual needs, it seems more reasonable to select people with certain social experience as civil servants. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Civil service positions in China are generally divided into general management, professional and technical, and administrative law enforcement categories. Professional and technical positions have a small number of people and high requirements, and young people usually have no opportunity; administrative law enforcement positions perform punishment, supervision, inspection and other responsibilities, involve major matters, and have tense interpersonal interactions, making it often difficult for newcomers to the job to be competent. There is a tradition of “mentoring and apprenticeship” in frontline law enforcement work, and here’s why. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the comprehensive management position, which has the largest number of people and handles the widest range of affairs, it is necessary to interact with people and involve the basic rights of citizens. Even a simple window clerk&#39;s ability, efficiency and sense of responsibility will have a significant impact. More comprehensive management positions will inherit the leadership&#39;s will and come down to merchants and individuals. While they work within the legal framework, they have a lot of room for personal judgment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A young man who has just stepped out of school and entered the public sector, lacking social experience and no work experience, can be said to be ignorant of the sufferings of the world to a certain extent. Its services and management are closely related to the interests of citizens. Especially in administrative law enforcement positions, the overturned palms of law enforcement officers often affect the joys and sorrows of other people&#39;s families. Is this appropriate? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From this perspective, middle-aged people who have long-term work experience and have dealt with complex relationships may be more suitable for civil servants. It’s not that they are more compassionate than young people, but they are better able to understand complex things, appreciate the hardships of the world, and make appropriate decisions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, we have seen from the media that individual civil servants are rigid in enforcing the law. To give a few examples, for example, in March this year, a snack bar in Fuzhou newly opened and placed several opening flower baskets at the door. It was deemed to be &quot;operating on the road&quot; and was fined a sum of money before it opened. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July this year, a man who sells vegetables on a tricycle in Henan received a &quot;sky-high price ticket&quot; for selling substandard vegetables. He made a profit of 21.05 yuan from selling vegetables and was fined 110,000 yuan. Outsiders find it unbelievable, but law enforcers have plausible arguments and can find evidence for them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to being fined for selling vegetables, there is a very controversial fine item in rural areas. If farmers kill their own pigs, it is not a big problem if they only eat the meat. If you sell a few kilograms of meat to your neighbors, you will face a fine of tens of thousands of yuan. This kind of thing was unimaginable in the past, but now it has become a common fine item in rural society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The decision-makers of these policies and penalties are all middle-aged cadres and above, and they seem to have nothing to do with young people - in fact, they were also young civil servants in the past. As soon as I graduated from university, I entered officialdom. Interpersonal interactions are simple, mainly about obeying or giving instructions; I have little financial experience, mainly spending money, and I never have to look for money when I am short of money. Professional civil servants are good at paperwork and conference affairs and have limited contact with people. There is a gap with real society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this reason, I agree with the call of contemporary middle-aged people to open the age limit for civil service examinations. Not only should the upper limit be relaxed, it would be better to set a lower limit. For example, we can discuss banning fresh graduates from taking civil service exams - they need to enter society and gain experience before they can manage and serve the public. Except for a small number of simple technical and internal civil servants, most civil servant positions should set age requirements and examine work ability to ensure that they are competent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Given that work history and abilities are relatively subjective, age is particularly important. Recruitment companies in the market will set requirements for job seekers&#39; working years and experience. The more important the position, the higher the requirements. Once incompetence is found, the job will be quickly demoted or even fired. In comparison, the recruitment criteria for civil servants are much simpler - almost only based on test scores, and there is no risk of unemployment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a lot of room for reform in the current civil servant recruitment and assessment model. The goal of the reform is to make civil servants more down-to-earth and less bureaucratic. Increasing the age requirement, examining professional resumes, and increasing the proportion of the contract appointment system are all directions that can be tried. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[专访《少年的你》导演曾国祥：“我不希望把责任推到谁的身上”丨影视大咖谈⑦]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257485]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 17:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/19/ 11/08/BHybgYSlr2zOIrNdKdL0mDhAAo7VfIRzcBt5eWhU.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/19/11/08/BHybgYSlr2zOIrNdKdL0mDh AAo7VfIRzcBt5eWhU. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;38825&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Director Zeng Guoxiang. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some eyes are only for teenagers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the movie &quot;Young You&quot;, Chen Nian and Xiao Bei, two low-income teenagers whose parents have neglected their duties, are like two helpless little animals who need to hug each other for warmth and lick each other&#39;s wounds. When one party accidentally did something wrong and faced jail time, the other party decided to stand up and &quot;take the blame&quot;, completing an agreement that could change their fate almost instantly. There is no verbal communication, the eyes are enough to show the firm trust, and he will not hesitate to be broken into pieces. Director Tsang Kwok-hsiang is well aware of the value of a young man&#39;s eyes, so he shot a large number of close-ups, hoping to show the fire in the young man&#39;s eyes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The eyes were exchanged again, and the location shifted to the visiting room of the detention center. A glass wall separates them from two worlds. The young man&#39;s face overlaps on the glass. You are in me, and I am in you. There should have been a thousand words, but once again, there were no words, just looking at each other, tears streaming down their faces. Soon, their fate will be reversed again. This is also a scene that makes Zeng Guoxiang proud. He insisted on not having any dialogue and what he wanted to say was expressed clearly in his eyes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of November 6, 2019, the 13th day of release, this movie focusing on college entrance examinations, tutoring and campus bullying has grossed more than 1.2 billion yuan at the box office and has a Douban score of 8.4. Yi Yang Qianxi, who plays Xiaobei, gave an impressive performance, which made him far away from the label of &quot;traffic star&quot;. The discussion also went beyond the movie itself, with many viewers recalling the joys and sorrows of their own growth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Young You&quot; tells an alternative story about the college entrance examination. In the college entrance examination re-reading class, Chen Nian, a good student played by Zhou Dongyu, witnessed his friends being bullied on campus and chose to shut up. Unfortunately, he himself became a victim of bullying. She is focused on completing more important things, that is, relying on the college entrance examination to change the fate of herself and her mother who ran away to avoid debts. Xiaobei is a &quot;little gangster&quot; who was abandoned by his parents since he was a child and grew up on the streets. They came together by an accident, and Xiaobei soon appeared silently like a shadow on Chen Nian&#39;s way to and from school, protecting her from bullying. How could life be normal? One &quot;derailment&quot; and the dominoes fell. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhou Dongyu has always been quirky and casual, which is often the case in movies. In her first film &quot;July and Ansheng&quot;, which she collaborated with Zeng Guoxiang, she just acted according to her personality, and the director just captured the moments that felt useful. But in &quot;Young You&quot;, Zeng Guoxiang repeatedly told her: &quot;I don&#39;t want Zhou Dongyu.&quot; Many times, Zhou Dongyu almost collapsed. She especially couldn&#39;t understand that if Chen Nian was beaten, he could just beat him back. Why endure it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I kept explaining to her, because you are not only carrying your own destiny, but also your mother&#39;s future.&quot; Zeng Guoxiang recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Guoxiang also needs to know more things. At first, he could not appreciate the great significance of the college entrance examination to the individual. His father is the famous actor Eric Tsang. He completed his studies in Canada, and his background is very different from that of mainland candidates. He watched a lot of documentaries about the college entrance examination and read related books. During the two days of the college entrance examination, he and his team stayed outside a middle school in Chongqing to capture photos. They stayed there from six or seven in the morning until the students left the examination room, and then they stopped working. Those two days meant a lot to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The film was shot in Chongqing, and there are many scenes worth pondering. There is a spiral bridge next to the school, which looks like the Colosseum in ancient Rome, reminiscent of the atmosphere of the college entrance examination; at the same time, it spirals upward, like a metaphor for youth growth, and a turning point in the story is also placed here. In real life, this is just a pedestrian bridge at Tongyuanju Subway Station on Chongqing Metro Line 3. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It’s like a maze. These young children can’t seem to get out of this world. We chose Chongqing because the city has many ups and downs, highs and lows, and many winding alleys. It feels like it takes forever to walk. You can&#39;t leave this place. There are viaducts and buildings everywhere you go, which gives you a feeling of pressure. We hope to present this sense of oppression and the feeling of being trapped in a place in the movie.&quot; Zeng Guoxiang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 1, 2019, Zeng Guoxiang accepted an exclusive interview with Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&quot;To make a good movie, you must consider things from each character&quot;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics , Italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Young You&quot; has aroused a very enthusiastic response. What do you think triggered the audience&#39;s enthusiasm? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang:&lt;/strong>;At least in Chinese-language movies, the pain of growing up and school bullying are rarely discussed in this way. I didn&#39;t expect the response to be so big. Of course, when I wanted to make this movie, I also hoped to have such an effect. Let everyone reflect and show a little care and love to the people around them, which can have a positive impact. I have always felt that adolescence is a period that particularly needs protection and protection. Teenagers feel that the world is not good enough. The idea that they can change the world is particularly valuable and requires the protection and protection of adults. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;But in &quot;Young You&quot;, parents are collectively missing of. Chen Nian kept asking where the adults were when she was bullied. What are your thoughts? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang:&lt;/strong>;I don’t want to put the responsibility on anyone. Everyone has the responsibility. This matter is extremely complicated and is not just a problem for parents. Of course, the biggest influence on a child is the parents, but we explained the state of her family in the movie. Everyone is a little powerless, and they don’t treat others like this on purpose. Sometimes the environment is like this, and people like this are formed, and things like this happen. The same goes for schools, teachers, and other students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Before filming the movie, did you have any interviews with mainland campuses and senior high school students? Do some homework? Have you combined your own experience? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang:&lt;/strong>;We knew at the script stage that the college entrance examination would be a very important element. In fact, it is the timeline and backbone of the entire story. As the coming-of-age ceremony for this group of teenagers, the college entrance examination is a very, very important step. We did a lot of homework before filming. As a Hong Kong director who &quot;went north&quot;, I felt a lot of pressure to shoot such realistic subjects. I want to make sure that the things I shoot are down to earth. After watching it, everyone will feel that this is how they came here. This is the atmosphere during the college entrance examination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, I read a lot of documentaries and books about the college entrance examination, talked to some teachers and students about their state during the college entrance examination, and talked to the staff or friends around me about how they passed the college entrance examination. The filming of this film started in Chongqing in mid-July 2018. During the two days of the college entrance examination in June, we went to the examination room to capture photos. We stayed there from 6 or 7 in the morning until the students left the examination room after taking the exam before calling it a day and returning. Those two days were particularly meaningful to me. We observed many details and restored them in the movie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What are the details? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang:&lt;/strong>;We took pictures of the entire college entrance examination, what clothes parents wore, what they brought students to the examination room, the students’ state and eyes before entering the examination room, What to talk about. We tried our best to faithfully restore what we saw in the movie. Apart from the school uniforms, it does take into account the art of the movie, so it will be made a little neater and more beautiful, but not excessive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I didn’t put too much of my own experience into the movie. After all, my growing up experience was so different from that of the students in the movie. I just tried to refer to a lot of information and materials and tried to restore what I found interesting. It&#39;s hard for me to say how I feel about it. I can only say that I sympathize with them very much and understand their pressure. Before making this movie, I had been paying attention to the news about the college entrance examination. There were many characters and stories in it, which were very interesting. Every student is burdened with heavy pressure, which is unfamiliar to me and particularly touches me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although I also experienced the college entrance examination, in Canada at that time, we were quite relaxed. Although it is also a very important exam, I don’t take it that seriously. I think it is an exam that will change our future destiny. When I started working in the Mainland, I came across news reports about the college entrance examination one after another. I was particularly distressed by how much sweat some students put into preparing for the college entrance examination and how much pressure they had to bear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You majored in sociology at university. Did your professional background help? There are richer sociological issues implicit in &quot;Young You&quot;, such as class and upward mobility. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang: &lt;/strong>;Sociology taught me how to have empathy; after leaving school, sociology taught me how to approach the perspective of different classes, countries, and races. , see things from their perspective. During this filming on campus or before, I worked as a screenwriter and wrote the script. What is the background of each character, what will happen, how to make him have his current values, and his attitude towards things. This is a very big help. . As a director, to make a good movie, you must consider things from each character. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&quot;Use close-up to show the fire in their eyes&quot;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;You and Zhou Dongyu collaborated in &quot;July and Ansheng&quot;. At that time, you asked her to &quot;spare her acting&quot; and capture her suitable moments. Did you take the same approach this time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang: &lt;/strong>;No. After &quot;July and Ansheng&quot;, there will actually be pressure for us to work together again, because no one wants to repeat what we have done. When I photographed her before, I tried to capture her normal feeling, always going with her more naughty and casual feeling. But this time I suppressed all her past and told her very clearly that I don’t want the Zhou Dongyu of the past, and I hope that everyone can see a very different Zhou Dongyu. She understands very well and wants to find a breakthrough. During this collaboration, what I told her the most was &quot;I don&#39;t want Zhou Dongyu.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In &quot;Young You&quot;, the audience saw the big Zhou Dongyu Sometimes she is extremely tolerant. For example, she was always bullied by a group of girls in school. It is said that she was very dissatisfied during the filming. According to her character, it would be fine if she was bullied and beaten back. Why should she endure it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang: &lt;/strong>;She was very entangled when she first started filming. She couldn&#39;t believe it: Why do you have to endure it like this? I kept explaining to her that because you are not only burdened with your own destiny, but also your mother&#39;s future, if you resist and speak out, the result will be that you will not be able to study, review, and take the college entrance examination properly. The latter is more important to you than anything else. important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So I choose to close my eyes. I feel dissatisfied when others are bullied and cannot bear to see them, but don’t speak out. Later, she became the target of bullying, but she still chose to endure it, because she felt that everything would be fine after this year, and she would be able to leave this place and get into a good university. Her fate was different from that of her mother. So she has been under so much pressure and struggling. I kept explaining to Zhou Dongyu, and after the scene with her mother was finished, she gradually understood. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;There is a scene in the movie that is very impressive. Two teenagers are visiting a prison. faces overlapped on the glass. You also used many close-ups of characters&#39; faces in the film. Is this an aesthetic consideration? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang:&lt;/strong>;The method of overlapping faces is not my innovation. It has been done in many movies, but I think it is very suitable here. I have been analyzing this with the actors, and later on in the interrogation scene, the two people have become one. In the close-up of each person, there is a reflection of another person, that is, I am in you, and you are in me. I like to use a lot of close-ups in my previous films, but this time there are a lot more. Not only the close-ups of the main actors, but also the close-ups of many students, I wanted to capture the eyes and expressions of these teenagers. The young you and the young me have to show the innocence and straightforwardness of their youth.

What specific “training” did you do? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang: &lt;/strong>;It’s not that I changed him. Maybe people were biased against him before, labeling him an “idol” and a top traffic person. &quot;Little fresh meat&quot;, I immediately felt that he couldn&#39;t act. Everyone has not seen him act fairly, but he is actually a very serious boy. From the first day we chatted, to the time he joined the cast, he was really attentive and determined to be a good actor and play the role of Xiaobei well. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the scene where Xiaobei and Chen Nian were chatting about Xiaobei’s mother on the bed, I actually didn’t tell him that I wanted to cry at all. I just talked to him and explained his relationship with his mother. He brewed it by himself and acted it out. When the emotion arrived, tears naturally flowed down his face. This shows that Qian Xi himself is a very sensitive boy, and the mother-son relationship allows him to find the fulcrum to enter the character. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;“I hope to give the actors a sense of security on the set”&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Yi Yang Qianxi and Zhou Dongyu had a rivalry scene. When the two first came into contact, he pushed Zhou Dongyu into the corner. This scene was very tense and the scale was right. How did you explain the scene to him at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang: &lt;/strong>;This is a very good point. He was a little nervous at first. He had never had the experience of pressing a girl against the wall, so he was very embarrassed and shy and didn&#39;t know how to act. I also took a lot of shots during that scene, and I kept guiding and demonstrating to him how to do it. He also needed some time to adjust slowly. Patting and patting, he slowly let go, and we were able to reach the degree we needed. He is a very good actor, but he doesn’t have that much experience. We need to talk to him more and give him more time to meet our requirements for him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wei Lai, the perpetrator of campus bullying in the movie, happens to be a A very good-looking girl with a good family background. What are your considerations? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang: &lt;/strong>;We met the actors and wrote the script at the same time. I have always been confused about what kind of person to choose to play the role. I don’t want her to become so superficial. In many movies, one look at the person&#39;s appearance and you know that they are definitely the head of the bully, which we want to avoid as much as possible. I met many actors and kept an open attitude to see what kind of people I could meet that would inspire me. Later we met Zhou Ye, and it was actually she who inspired us to think this way. The day she came, we had a strong feeling that she was very confident, and then she was so beautiful and cute. At that time, we felt that if we cast such a person, with such a high starting point, and bullying others, the cruelty would be even stronger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many times, the people who have the least empathy do not necessarily have poor families or bad backgrounds. Instead, those with good family backgrounds but distorted family views are the most terrifying. They think that others can do whatever they want. I&#39;m at my mercy. So we set it from the beginning that Wei Lai has a good family environment and is good at studying, but her family view is very distorted and she has no empathy. She doesn&#39;t feel that she is doing anything wrong to others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;To sum up, do you have any unique experience in &quot;training&quot; actors? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang:&lt;/strong>;I have no secret, I am still very honest with actors. I hope to give the actors a sense of security on set, which is very important. Actors often bare their hearts to the audience. If they don&#39;t trust the director and the team, they will often protect themselves and their performance will not be that good. What the director can do is to invest more, shoot this point well, and consider their feelings more. Small things like this allow the actors to slowly build trust in you as the director, and then they will trust your opinions and tips. I often let the actors play the version they think is most correct, and I make adjustments based on that. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 17:55:10 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[我的家乡重庆丨月是故乡明⑤]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257350]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/ 12/02/nszAcS51cXSdJFRcz6yYfmyY5xfdkskn6p7vDzSc.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;940&quot; height=&quot;660&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/12/02/nszAcS51cXSdJFRcz6yYfmyY5xfdkskn6p7v DzSc. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;174010&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 1, 2012, in Ciqikou, Chongqing, citizens raised the Drinking tea and chatting on the rocks &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liu Song/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My hometown, Chongqing, is located in the southwest of China&#39;s inland area and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.

So far, Bian Xiu has a certain monopoly position in Lu&#39;an&#39;s pork market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Changquan&#39;s official career has also been smooth, and he has served as deputy director of the Yu&#39;an District Commerce Bureau, director of the Yu&#39;an District Key Project Construction Management Bureau, director of the Yu&#39;an District Real Estate Bureau, and director of the Real Estate Management Service Center. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Changquan did not deny his special relationship with Bian Xiu, admitting that the two had been in contact and understanding each other for many years, and confessed that Bian had bribed others for the pork business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, Sun Changquan confessed that in the process of acquiring the qualification to carry out pig slaughtering in urban areas through the acquisition of Tianan Company, a leader in Yu&#39;an District who was in charge of the pilot work of building a &quot;safe meat&quot; system summoned the pig office , the District Discipline Inspection Commission, the District State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the District Audit Bureau, the District Government Office and other units held several meetings and proposed that Tianan Company be handed over to Bian Xiu for exclusive management. In return, Bian Xiu paid for the leader&#39;s facade house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 27, 2023, the Anhui Discipline Inspection and Supervision website issued a notice stating that the leader had repeatedly violated regulations from 2013 to 2022 by accepting high-end liquor, gift cards, banquets and travel from management and service objects. Arrangement, he was dismissed from his post by the government and demoted to a fourth-level chief clerk. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The supervision team made an unannounced visit&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Bian Momo, whose career is getting bigger and bigger, deliberately spends money to protect himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The case record shows that at the end of 2015, on the recommendation of a leader of the Yu&#39;an District CPPCC, Bian Xiu, who had not graduated from elementary school, fabricated his undergraduate degree and was successfully elected as a member of the district CPPCC. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In early 2017, with the help of this leader, Bian modified and joined a certain democratic party. Afterwards, Bian Xiamian purchased a facade house worth more than 1.1 million yuan for him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rewards are also huge. Three of the five companies under Bian&#39;s name are engaged in the fixed-point slaughtering business of pigs and cattle, while in Yu&#39;an District, there are only four companies with relevant business qualifications. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Bian Modi, who has obtained a monopoly position, is not satisfied with this. In addition to requiring the Pig Office to supervise the pork flowing into the rural market from Xishang Company, and to inspect the &quot;outside meat&quot; slaughtered outside Yu&#39;an District and sold into the rural market, Bian also forced the butchers who came to slaughter to use pig offal. Deduct slaughtering fees to monopolize and crack down on the meat slaughtering market in the region. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The verdict records that in early 2013, because he was dissatisfied with a butcher who wanted to take back the internal organs of the slaughtered pigs, Yan Guang publicly insulted and beat him, and finally choked him and pushed him out of the slaughterhouse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why don’t you charge a slaughtering fee but forcefully take the pigs away? An operator who purchased pig offal from Tianan Company in 2017 said that over the years, the price of a pair of pig offal has been as low as 90 yuan and as high as 150 yuan. When African swine fever is prevalent, the price is even higher. , and the slaughtering fee is generally tens of yuan, and the value is much lower than that of pig offal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the audit by Shucheng Antai Accounting Firm, from March 2013 to September 2021, Bian Modified’s two companies slaughtered more than 1.13 million pigs and used pig offal to deduct pig slaughtering fees. In this way, he obtained illegal income of 71.756167 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2020, more than 80 pork vendors jointly submitted a letter of complaint, reporting that Bian Xiu and others were involved in gangs and evil. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon of September 4, 2021, the eighth supervision team of the eighth major inspection of the State Council came to Yu&#39;an District to conduct an unannounced inspection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A situation report written by the Yu&#39;an District People&#39;s Government Office in the same month showed that the inspection mainly focused on three specific people&#39;s livelihood issues: the issue of demolition and resettlement costs in a community, the issue of water meter replacement charges in a community, and pig products in the district Difficulty in circulation and sales. Issues such as law enforcement officers&#39; crackdowns on interfering merchants and the monopolistic behavior of a Shunxin slaughterhouse owned by Bian Hao were also included in the report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For three consecutive days starting from September 4, 2021, the then Secretary of the Yu&#39;an District Party Committee held 4 meetings on the issue of pig slaughter and sales. On September 5, the Yu&#39;an District Government established a special investigation team on pig circulation issues, with seven units taking the lead in conducting investigations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 4, 2021, the Yu&#39;an District Government announced that the previously implemented registration of livestock products from other places entering Yu&#39;an did not comply with relevant legal regulations and had decided to cancel it. On the same day, the original livestock and poultry slaughtering joint law enforcement team was cancelled, and the relevant responsible persons were also held accountable by the Discipline Inspection Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The inspection incident was officially settled one month later. On October 11, 2021, the Yu&#39;an District Committee issued a completion report document, which mentioned that since 2013, the Yu&#39;an District Government Office has issued pig slaughter management working documents seven times in succession, but the legality of the Yu&#39;an District Justice Bureau has been verified After review, the relevant documents were annulled, and the legal representative of Tianan Company, Bian Xixiang, was also criminally detained by the public security organs and put on file for investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Deeply intertwined&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On November 21, 2021, January 18, 2022, and July 22, 2022, Lu&#39;an City Public Security Bureau The bureau has collected clues from the public three times about Bian Modification&#39;s criminal gangs involving gangs and evil. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Changquan’s defender introduced that the case was initially filed for investigation by the Yu’an Branch, and was later upgraded to the jurisdiction of the Lu’an City Public Security Bureau for investigation, and the Shucheng County Public Security Bureau was designated for further investigation. September 27, 2022 , the case was transferred to the Shucheng County People&#39;s Procuratorate for review and prosecution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The court held that the underworld gang headed by Bian Xiu and Sun Changquan was in its initial formation stage from 2001 to 2007. From 2012 to 2021, the gang &quot;through the deep interweaving of public power and organizational power, form an inseparable and unified whole.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The court held that the criminal gangs of Bian Xiu and Sun Changquan carried out two robberies in total and suppressed other meat product operators in the name of law enforcement since 2007, which constituted the crime of provoking trouble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1997, the State Council implemented the &quot;Regulations on the Administration of Pig Slaughter&quot; and implemented a system of designated slaughter and centralized quarantine of pigs across the country. The following year, the Lu&#39;an City Pig Slaughter Management Office was established, with a pig market inspection team responsible for the management, coordination, supervision, and inspection of pig slaughter in the city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Documents issued by the Yu&#39;an District Commerce Bureau show that in order to implement the &quot;Pig Slaughter Management Regulations&quot; of the State Council, the Yu&#39;an District Commerce Bureau established a commercial law enforcement and inspection squadron in 2000, headed by the deputy director of the Commerce Bureau. He also serves as the squadron leader and is responsible for inspecting non-fixed slaughtering and sales of pigs in the region, as well as the transportation of live pigs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 9, 2013, the &quot;Summary of the Construction of the &quot;Safe Meat&quot; System in Yu&#39;an District&quot; mentioned that in accordance with the document &quot;Strengthening the Management of Cold Fresh Meat from Other Areas&quot;, Yu&#39;an District conducts full supervision of external pork. , set up inspection points to maintain the order of the meat food market in Yu&#39;an District. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Statistics from Southern Weekend reporters found that among the criminal facts related to the crime of picking quarrels and provoking trouble, a total of 103 were related to the criminal gang confiscating meat products from other business owners or preventing their transportation and sale, and another 7 The incident was caused by the Tianan Company forcing the butchers to pay for the slaughtering fee by using pig meat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Changquan’s defender believes that among the more than 100 illegal and criminal acts of picking quarrels and provoking troubles charged by the public prosecution, except for a few cases where the victims were lawfully enforced for selling substandard meat, the rest were all due to the Pig Office’s It is caused by the inspection of meat. When the local pig office clearly stipulates that the pig office can implement market access to meat from other places, deviations caused by the implementation or understanding of the policy should not be considered as provocation and troublemaking behavior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, regarding the crime of robbery, a crime occurred at 6 a.m. on October 10, 2013. At that time, the deputy general manager of Tianan Company led a team to impose regulations on the &quot;Yurun Pork Monopoly&quot; on the grounds that Lu&#39;an City&#39;s urban pig product circulation management regulations require that urban pig products must be registered and filed with the Municipal Commerce Bureau and require &quot;secondary inspection.&quot; Pork from other places sold in &quot;shops&quot; will be inspected and seized. During this period, the boss Zhan Xian tried to stop him with a knife and called the police. Later, Bian Xiamian and Sun Bangsheng rushed to the scene. Several people had a physical conflict, and 600 kilograms of pork stored in the cold storage of the store was finally confiscated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Bangsheng is also one of the defendants in this case. The Shucheng County People&#39;s Court sentenced Sun Bangsheng to 12 years and 6 months in prison for the crimes of underworld organization, robbery, and picking quarrels and provoking trouble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters tried to ask Zhan Xian for more information about that year, but he said it had been too long and he did not want to mention it again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the criminal facts related to the sale of live pigs, the first-instance judgment also mentioned that at the same time as Bian Xixiang’s pork business started, starting in 2010, Bian Xiuxiang also entered the real estate field with Sun Changquan and developed many properties. A real estate project, but the first start-up capital came from embezzled public funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[这一天，七位中国选手得到了他们迟到的奖牌]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258110]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On the evening of October 4, 2023, the replacement Olympic medal ceremony for Chinese track and field athletes was held at the Hangzhou Olympics Held at the Sports Center Stadium.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/05/1caa387610.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/05/1caa387610.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253031&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999 ; text-align: center;&quot;>;On the evening of October 4, 2023, the supplementary Olympic medal ceremony for Chinese track and field athletes was held at the Hangzhou Olympic Sports Center Stadium. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of October 4, 2023, after the track and field competition of the Hangzhou Asian Games, the Chinese Olympic Committee held a replacement Olympic medal award ceremony at the competition site.

Krautz was born in Hungary in 1962. He received his PhD from the Technical University of Vienna in Austria in 1991. He is currently the director of the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics in Germany and a professor at the Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich in Germany. Le Huillier was born in Paris, France, in 1958. He received his PhD from Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris in 1986 and is currently a professor at Lund University in Sweden. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With this award, Lehulier also became the fifth woman to win the Nobel Prize in Physics. The previous four winners were Marie Curie in 1903 and Marie Curie in 1963. Maria Goppert-Mayer in 2018, Donna Strickland in 2018 and Andrea Gates in 2020. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These three physicists were awarded this year&#39;s Nobel Prize in Physics because their experiments provided humans with new tools to explore the electronic world inside atoms and molecules. They demonstrated a method of creating extremely short light pulses that can be used to measure the rapid processes by which electrons move, or change energy. In 2022, Lehuillier and Kraus also won the Wolf Prize in Physics for &quot;pioneering contributions to ultrafast laser science and attosecond physics.&quot; At that time, another co-winner was a Canadian physicist. Paul Corkum, a professor at the University of Ottawa. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Finding the fastest &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; &quot;shutter&quot; &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Events of short duration cannot be observed by the human eye. For example, a hummingbird can beat its wings 80 times per minute, but we can only see the blurry motion of the hummingbird while hearing the humming sound. Thanks to high-speed photography, we can see events that seem fleeting to us, like the beating of a hummingbird&#39;s wings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The faster events happen, the faster you have to take photos to capture those moments. If we want to explore truly ephemeral events, we need very special techniques. At the scale of molecules and atoms, events occur at extremely fast speeds. For example, within a molecule, the time it takes for atoms to move or change is on the order of femtoseconds. Femtosecond is a very short time, 1 femtosecond is equal to 10&lt;sup>;-15&lt;/sup>; seconds. At this point, the motion of the atoms can be studied using very short pulses generated by the laser. However, when electrons move inside atoms or molecules, changes in the femtosecond time scale become very blurry because they move too fast. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, in the world of electrons, changes occur in tens of attoseconds. Attosecond is a unit of time, and 1 attosecond is equal to 10&lt;sup>;-18&lt;/sup>; seconds, which is a very small time scale. One attosecond relative to one second is equivalent to one second relative to the age of the universe. Therefore, if physicists want to explore the electronic world inside molecules and atoms, they need to find a fast enough &quot;shutter&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/05/dCHhgjLb11KQemJoZt6qZLFqlEBnkQCIRJFPMJ8F.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;636&quot; height= &quot;638&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/05/dCHhgjLb11KQemJoZt6qZLFqlEBnkQCIRJFPMJ8F.png&quot; data-key=&quot;253043&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Attosecond physics gives physicists the opportunity to observe the motion of electrons. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Nobel Prize official website/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Femtoseconds have long been considered the limit of the shortest possible light pulses. Improving existing techniques is not enough to see processes taking place on the extremely short time scales of electron movement; doing so requires completely new techniques. Experiments by three of this year&#39;s laureates produced extremely short pulses of light, measured in attoseconds, demonstrating that these pulses can be used to provide images of processes inside atoms and molecules. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The Birth of Attosecond Physics&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Light is a wave produced by changes in electric and magnetic fields.

For example, red light has a wavelength of about 700 nanometers, one-hundredth the width of a human hair, and it fluctuates about 430 trillion times per second. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The shortest light pulse is the length of a single period in the light wave. If traditional methods are used to create ultrashort light pulses, the duration of each light pulse will never be less than femtoseconds, making it impossible to observe the movement of electrons. In the 1980s, physicists thought this was a very difficult limit to overcome. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the mathematics of describing waves shows that any waveform can be constructed using waves of the right size, wavelength, and amplitude (the distance between crests and troughs). The secret to building attosecond pulses is to create shorter pulses by combining more light with shorter wavelengths. To obtain these shorter wavelength light, we need to use a phenomenon called &quot;gas harmonics&quot; produced when the laser passes through the gas. The harmonics here are like the overtones produced when plucking guitar strings. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1987, Lehuillier discovered that when she passed an infrared laser through a rare gas, it produced more and stronger &quot;overtones&quot; than in previous experiments. When the laser passes through the gas, the laser interacts with the atoms in the gas. The extra energy gained by the electrons in the interaction is released in the form of light pulses, and these light pulses from the electrons are the &quot;overtones&quot; in the experiment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once these &quot;overtones&quot; appear, they interact with each other. When the peaks of light waves coincide, the light becomes stronger, but when the peaks in one cycle coincide with the troughs of another cycle, the light becomes weaker. Under the right circumstances, the &quot;overtones&quot; coincide and a series of light pulses appear, each lasting a few hundred attoseconds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Physicists understood the theory in the 1990s, but it wasn&#39;t until 2001 that they made a breakthrough in actually identifying and testing light pulses. Agostini and his collaborators in France succeeded that year in generating and studying a series of successive light pulses. Using a special trick, they combined these light pulses with delayed portions of the original laser pulse to see how the overtones synchronized with each other. This process allowed them to measure that each pulse lasted only 250 attoseconds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meanwhile, Kraus and his collaborators in Austria developed a technique to select individual pulses. The pulse they successfully isolated lasted 650 attoseconds, which the team used to track and the study of processes that pull electrons out of atoms. These experiments show that scientists can observe and measure attosecond pulses, and that these attosecond pulses can also be used in new experiments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The future of attosecond physics&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, the attosecond world is within our reach. These short pulses of light can be used to study the movement of electrons. Physicists can already obtain pulses as low as tens of attoseconds, and the technology continues to evolve. Eva Olsson, chair of the Nobel Prize Committee in Physics, said: &quot;We can now open the door to the world of electrons. Attosecond physics gives us the opportunity to understand the mechanisms governed by electrons. The next step is to exploit These mechanisms.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, Chinese physicists are also conducting research on attosecond physics and are collaborating closely with international colleagues, including the winners of this Nobel Prize in Physics. For example, the Institute of Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Songshan Lake Materials Laboratory jointly established the Attosecond Science Center in Dongguan, Guangdong. The Institute of Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences built a comprehensive extreme conditions experimental facility in Huairou Science City, Beijing, which can provide ultrafast data of about 100 attoseconds. For light fields, the Xi&#39;an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences established the Attosecond Science and Technology Research Center in 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Attosecond physics has potential applications in many fields. For example, in electronics research, it is important to understand and control the behavior of electrons in a material. Attosecond pulses can also be used to identify different molecules, which could have applications in medical diagnosis. In the future, we are expected to see attosecond physics play a more important role in basic and applied research, helping us deepen our understanding of the physical world while bringing more benefits to human life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 14:25:20 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[不止于新冠疫苗，有可能引发疫苗革命 ——透视2023年诺贝尔生理学或医学奖]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258126]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 13:46:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On October 2, 2023, Beijing time, the Swedish Nobel Prize Committee announced that for the invention of nucleotide base modification , thus developing an effective messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine, American scientists Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman won the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, and they will share 1100 SEK 10,000 bonus. Due to the great success of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, Carrico and Weisman have won many major awards including the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, the Lasker Prize and so on. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine this time is truly well-deserved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/05/fAsK0dPttYF2W8soIvVJrdEUBDYF79H9JgXcOZRc.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;982&quot; height= &quot;736&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/05/fAsK0dPttYF2W8soIvVJrdEUBDYF79H9JgXcOZRc.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253045&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Drew Weissman and Katalin Karikó, the main pioneers of mRNA vaccines. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Cell website/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Pioneer&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Carico 1955 Born in Szolnok, Hungary, after receiving his PhD in Hungary, he moved to the United States in 1985 and entered into postdoctoral research at Temple University in Philadelphia and Bethesda University of Health Sciences, focusing on research on the medical application of mRNA. After experiencing a series of setbacks such as frustrated funding applications, demotions and salary cuts, and suffering from cancer, Carrico met her long-term research partner Professor Drew Weisman. The two met dramatically because of their fight for a copy machine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, Professor Weismann was already a moderately accomplished immunologist. Weisman, two years younger than Carrico, was born in Lexington, Massachusetts, USA. He received a doctorate in medicine from Boston University in 1987. When he met Carrico, Weissman had just established his own research group at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, working on research in areas such as AIDS vaccines. After learning about Carrico&#39;s research interests, Weisman suggested that Carrico switch to the field of mRNA vaccines and decided to collaborate with her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But mRNA vaccine research is not easy because mRNA is an extremely unstable small nucleotide molecule. The mRNA molecule is widely present in living organisms. It is the &quot;messenger&quot; for DNA to guide cell cooperation proteins. It is responsible for transmitting the genetic information of the gene to the ribosome, which &quot;installs according to the diagram&quot; and assembles the amino acid &quot;parts&quot; into various proteins. Therefore, mRNA is called messenger RNA. After completing its mission, the mRNA is quickly broken down by enzymes in the cell and its existence time is very short. If mRNA is injected into the body as a vaccine, these mRNA molecules will be broken down quickly before they can instruct cells to synthesize proteins. What&#39;s even more deadly is that animal experiments show that injecting unmodified mRNA into the body can trigger an immune response in the body, leading to serious adverse reactions to the vaccine. mRNA vaccines have also been ignored. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In response to these problems, Carrico and Weisman conducted a series of studies. Although funds were limited, they still persisted in this direction and made some major breakthroughs. In 2005, Carrico and Weisman discovered that some natural nucleotides in messenger RNA were important factors in causing adverse immune responses in the body. They found the nucleotides in messenger RNA that triggered adverse immune responses, and then used artificially synthesized Nucleotide replacement significantly weakened adverse immune responses. This study laid a key foundation for the subsequent development of mRNA vaccines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, Carrico, Weisman and others improved the messenger RNA vaccine to increase the stability of the mRNA vaccine in the body. For example, they used a liposome &quot;coat&quot; to coat the messenger RNA vaccine. Wrap it up so that it cannot be broken down by nucleases before entering the cell. With the continuous improvement of technology, there is increasing hope for the industrialization of mRNA vaccines. Compared with traditional vaccines, mRNA vaccines have some obvious advantages, such as good safety, short design and development cycle, low production cost, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;New Opportunities&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;However, before the outbreak of the new crown epidemic, mRNA vaccines had been tepid. At that time, dozens of mRNA-based vaccines were being developed around the world, and a few vaccines such as influenza vaccine, Zika virus vaccine, and rabies vaccine had entered clinical trials, but none had yet been approved for human disease prevention. This situation quickly changed due to the global pandemic of the new coronavirus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thanks to long-term accumulation, BioNTech, a German biotechnology company where Carrico serves as vice president and head of RNA therapy development, quickly launched new crown vaccine research and development after the outbreak of the new crown epidemic. The mRNA COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2, which targets the spike protein of COVID-19, was developed. Due to the emergency of the epidemic, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also given the green light to clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines such as mRNA vaccines, greatly shortening the pre-clinical animal testing and clinical trial time of COVID-19 vaccines, which originally took several years or even more than ten years. The clinical trial was completed in just 7 months. Fortunately, BNT162b2 not only shows good safety, but the effectiveness of the vaccine has also reached an astonishing over 90%, which is significantly better than traditional vaccines. Since the end of 2020, most countries and regions around the world, including the United Kingdom and the United States, have successively approved the emergency use of BNT162b2 vaccine. At the same time, the new coronavirus RNA vaccine mRNA-1273 developed by the American company Moderna also achieved similar results, and this vaccine is also based on the patented mRNA vaccine technology of Carrico and Weissman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In less than a year from vaccine design, clinical trials to approval for marketing, BNT162b2 and other mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have created a miracle in the history of vaccine research and development. This is of course related to the global pandemic of the new crown epidemic, but it is mainly due to the good safety and excellent effectiveness of the mRNA new crown vaccine. Judging from the real application data of subsequent large-scale immunization and the preventive effect against new coronavirus variants, mRNA new coronavirus vaccines such as BNT162b2 also performed well. According to the Nobel Prize website, more than 13 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered around the world, saving millions of lives. BNT162b2 and other mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are among the most outstanding vaccines. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Vaccine revolution? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;If the mRNA vaccine can only work in the new coronavirus epidemic, its charm will be greatly reduced. In fact, greatly encouraged by the success of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, dozens of clinical studies based on mRNA vaccines around the world are accelerating. If its application scope can be expanded, the mRNA vaccine technology pioneered by Carrico and Weismann is expected to start a vaccine revolution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are currently two main application directions for mRNA vaccines. The first major application direction is to prevent infectious diseases. In addition to COVID-19, the current mRNA vaccines against human infectious diseases caused by pathogens such as epidemic viruses, Zika virus, cytomegalovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus have also entered Phase II or III. Clinical Trials. According to a press release issued by Moderna on September 13, 2023, the company has submitted marketing authorization applications for the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) mRNA vaccine globally, and the seasonal influenza mRNA vaccine has been approved in three clinical trials. All trials also demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second main application direction is the treatment of cancer. According to the US clinical trial website, there are currently nearly 50 mRNA vaccines related to cancer treatment in the world that have entered or completed phase II clinical trials, including Bion. A number of mRNA vaccines for cancer treatment developed by companies such as Tektronix and Moderna have entered Phase II clinical trials. These vaccines mainly target cancers such as melanoma, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and head and neck squamous carcinoma. Among them, there are high hopes that mRNA vaccines can be used in combination with other anti-tumor drugs to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatment. According to the results of a phase II clinical trial jointly released by Moderna and the US pharmaceutical giant Merck at the end of 2022, an mRNA vaccine developed by Moderna performed well when used in combination with Merck&#39;s checkpoint inhibitor Keytruda. Good, over 1 year, the mRNA vaccine combined with Keytruda led to a more than 40% reduction in the risk of cancer recurrence or death in patients with stage 3/4 melanoma compared with Keytruda alone. Moderna and Merck plan to launch phase III clinical trials of this treatment in 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of now, apart from the multiple COVID-19 vaccines that have been approved for marketing, no mRNA vaccine has yet been approved for marketing. It remains to be seen whether the mRNA vaccine can show promising results in the prevention of other infectious diseases and cancer treatment. However, judging from the current progress of clinical trials, it is only a matter of time before a new mRNA vaccine is approved for marketing. The vaccine revolution initiated by mRNA technology may come soon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 13:55:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
