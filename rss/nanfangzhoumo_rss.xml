For example, young people Signing up for the &quot;Sunset Red&quot; tour group, some office workers who don&#39;t want to order takeout flocked to the canteen for the elderly, and some young people squeezed into various interest classes at the university for the elderly and discovered &quot;really delicious&quot;... These new trends on social platforms, It is ridiculed by the outside world as &quot;old-fashioned consumption&quot;. Why has moving closer to the consumption patterns of middle-aged and elderly people become the “life they aspire to” for many young people? How to treat it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, I think the direct motivation for &quot;old-fashioned consumption&quot; is low price attraction. Whether it is a &quot;Sunset Red&quot; tour group, a canteen for the elderly, or a university for the elderly, what they all have in common is the relatively low price. The presupposition is that the elderly retire from their jobs and have no financial resources except pensions. With little other income, the selling price of goods or services targeted at this group is naturally lower than the normal market price. More importantly, as part of the social security system for the elderly, the government pays for some services or items (in this case, there is some controversy about young people taking advantage of the elderly), and some businesses have also started to pay for them in order to promote sales. Give it to the elderly. The fact that young people are &quot;mingling among them&quot; undoubtedly reflects their pursuit of low-priced goods or services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, traveling can be regarded as a relaxing experience. The recipes in the elderly canteen will most likely not be any different. The courses taught by the elderly university cover flower arrangement, painting, calligraphy and other talents and skills. Skills, the quality of these goods or services will not be too bad. In other words, it is not an exaggeration to say that the above-mentioned goods or services have the basic characteristics of &quot;high quality and low price&quot; and good cost performance. Young people have discovered this opportunity and made full use of it to enrich and enrich themselves. I think it is a wise move. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, this truly reflects the objective fact that young people are under great pressure to survive. The overall economy is in a downward trend, the population is aging, the subsequent impact of the epidemic has not been completely eliminated, and the number of college graduates is increasing. The competition for employment is extremely fierce and it is difficult to find a job. At the same time, they are also faced with work pressure, promotion pressure, renting and buying a house, pressure to get married and start a family, pressure to have children, etc. To be honest, the overall survival and development situation of contemporary young people Not optimistic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Considering specific activities such as traveling and attending classes at senior universities, we believe that young people’s participation in them is a response to the high-intensity, high-pressure, and fast-paced production that young people generally find themselves in in the context of urbanization and modernization. A kind of resistance, rebellion and temporary escape (escapism) from the way of life. Faced with various production and lifestyles with &quot;involution&quot; as their basic characteristics, which have no way to escape, young people can actively debug, adjust and make some changes, and achieve relief and decompression through travel, study, etc. Purpose, I think it is a pretty good thing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, &quot;old-fashioned consumption&quot; should not be understood in a narrow sense as the field of consumption, but should be interpreted from the perspective of the specific consumption process and the concrete experience in the consumption process, that is, the social nature of consumption cannot or is not easily ignored. feature. The core essence of &quot;old-fashioned consumption&quot; is that young people and the elderly get along and interact with each other for a certain period of time. Travel can be as short as one or two days, as long as three to five days or a week, to eat in the elderly canteen and to attend classes at the elderly university. This allows young people and older people to spend more time together, and such interactions will produce significant learning effects. And this kind of learning is two-way rather than one-way, because through such interactions and exchanges, young people can gain life experience provided by their elders, and the elders can be infected by the vitality or passion of young people. Especially for the elderly, if young people are willing to listen to their stories or sharing, they usually feel happy and satisfied, and their sense of self-worth will be significantly enhanced. In this sense, the precise expression of &quot;old-fashioned consumption&quot; should be &quot;mutual consumption&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A direct effect of this &quot;old-fashioned consumption&quot; is to repair or improve the relationship between young people and their older relatives in their families or clans. In reality, there are some young people, especially young men, who have little communication with their parents. They often keep a distance from their parents in the name of generation gap. This is the so-called &quot;disconnection&quot; phenomenon, but they have no relationship with their parents outside. Communication among the elderly is tolerant, and some young people often take the initiative or actively communicate with the elderly. Obviously, occasional or regular participation in &quot;old-fashioned consumption&quot; will undoubtedly have a positive effect on increasing the close relationship between young people and their families. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for &quot;old-fashioned consumption&quot;, some people may think that this will squeeze out the resources of the elderly. A bunch of chattering young people suddenly join the tour group, and the elderly will feel that the young people have somewhat affected their &quot; &quot;The right to tranquility&quot;; when a bunch of young people suddenly come to join in the fun in the seniors&#39; canteen, the old people will feel it is too noisy; when a bunch of young people suddenly break into the classroom to teach, the old people will feel crowded and uncomfortable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The more fundamental doubt is that the above-mentioned various special services or benefits only for the elderly are paid for by the government and are part of the security system for the elderly. Now, young people are flocking to them, and there is obvious The rights or rights of the elderly are suspected of being raided. But the author believes that we should not understand the word &quot;resource&quot; statically. If the elderly or even most elderly people benefit from and acquire it because of the participation or joining of young people, this is undoubtedly another hidden precious resource. It should be noted that resources are not only economic-oriented, but also include social-oriented resources in a broad sense, which mainly refers to the level of social communication and social interaction; resources are not limited to initial static resources, and resources in a broad sense also exist after the initial resource investment. Learned resources, we might as well imagine the latter as the multiplier effect in the field of economics or investment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What I mean is that a cross-age or mixed-age (fixed structure) population structure usually produces a good comprehensive effect because each other benefits from or benefits from mutual exchanges and learning. We can also understand it as the application or application of economies of scale and economies of scope theories in daily life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I couldn’t help but think of two things. One is in Japan. During the layout process, some kindergartens or primary schools will choose to be adjacent to nursing homes. At eight o&#39;clock in the morning, the elderly can hear the sound of reading aloud from next door as scheduled; at four o&#39;clock in the afternoon, the elderly will see the school after school at the entrance of the nursing home. The children bowed to themselves and politely said &quot;Hello Grandpa&quot; and &quot;Wish you a happy day, Grandma&quot;; on weekends or holidays, a group of children and their teachers came to the nursing home to perform performances for the elderly, eat together, and Play games, and as feedback, the elderly can occasionally or often go to the school next door to talk about the past and present lives of their city or community. I believe that this is the proper meaning of &quot;being productive in old age&quot; and &quot;being happy in old age&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The other is that in recent years, some domestic cities have proposed to build urban development goals for specific groups. For example, Shanghai proposed to build an age-friendly city, Beijing proposed to build a youth-friendly city, and Shenzhen proposed to build a child-friendly city. Changsha proposes to build a female-friendly city. I just wonder, if this kind of special care for a certain group of people is singled out and used as an important part of urban development goals or urban development strategies, isn&#39;t it suspected of &quot;social deprivation&quot; for other groups? ? What do you mean by just being friendly to the elderly? Unfriendly to young people? Not child friendly? Is its essential point that when this kind of preferential policy for specific groups of people is used as an urban development goal or strategy, there will inevitably be a package of follow-up measures in terms of funds, projects, policies, planning, etc. To put it more bluntly, It means that a lot of real money is invested in specific groups of people, which is obviously not fair and reasonable for other groups. In the long run, this move is intended to harm or harm the city&#39;s diversity, inclusiveness and equity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similarly, I also disagree with the suggestions or suggestions of some people and even some experts to build special women&#39;s (subway) carriages or children&#39;s (high-speed rail) carriages. Why can’t we build a high-end society that is gender-friendly, gender-equal, and gender-integrated through extensive publicity and innovative practices? Why can&#39;t we be tolerant of children who are active or crying, or even adopt more positive and proactive methods, such as actively chatting with children, playing games, playing poker, etc., so that children can feel the affection of uncles, aunts, brothers and sisters in the carriage? What about warmth? Obviously, whether it is a women&#39;s (subway) carriage or a children&#39;s (high-speed rail) carriage, they are all short-sighted moves aimed at evading and avoiding the problem, and they are all deliberately or deliberately aimed at &quot;distinctiveness&quot; and &quot;community isolation&quot; ” (social segregation), all of which are against or deviating from the basic principles of mixed-age or cross-age. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a professor at the Department of Sociology, Guangzhou University)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010; &quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 22 Nov 2023 15:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[南周x读库2024联合征订，买1得10，错过等1年！]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261065]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-22 15:08:03&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;&lt;span>;&lt;span>;At the beginning of this year, we [Nanzhou x Reading Library] joint subscription was launched.

Generate attention. Spending two generations&#39; &quot;six wallets&quot; to buy their first home is a price many ordinary home buyers have to pay. How to avoid buying a &quot;poisonous land&quot;? This has also become a topic of widespread concern. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;my country&#39;s soil pollution laws and regulations were promulgated relatively late. In 2019, the Soil Pollution Prevention and Control Law began to be implemented. Combined with other documents, three situations require soil pollution status investigation: The first is the change of land use to residential, public management and public services (referred to as &quot;one residential, two public&quot;); the second is the construction land plots with soil pollution risks; the third is the change of land use for production and operation of key soil pollution supervision units, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to the requirements of laws and regulations such as the Soil Pollution Prevention and Control Law, soil environment investigation reports must be disclosed to the public in accordance with regulations, but the legal provisions on information disclosure are not specific enough. Soil pollution is hidden, and home buyers need to check the land use history. Generally speaking, it is safer if the land was originally farmland, residential, public facilities, or green space park types, and there are basically no other migration pathways for pollutants in the surrounding land. If it is a converted contaminated site, you need to pay attention to the results of soil assessment. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Soil information disclosure is uneven&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Because there are no clear regulations, there are various channels for soil information disclosure, making it difficult to search with one click. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Guo Lei, a staff member of the environmental protection organization &quot;Guangzhou Green Network Environmental Protection Service Center&quot; (hereinafter referred to as Green Network) told the Southern Weekly reporter that our country&#39;s laws do not provide for soil In what channels should the environmental investigation report be made public, what content should be made public, etc. In actual situations, some reports are made public on the websites of real estate developers, and some are published on industry forums of companies commissioned to investigate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since 2016, Green Network has regularly collected from hundreds of websites and compiled tens of thousands of reports related to soil pollution investigation and remediation for free public review. However, public awareness of this aggregated information is not high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The professional nature of information disclosure content also increases the difficulty for users to access it. The public generally searches for the subdivision or developer name, but reports often use parcel numbers provided by the Department of Natural Resources. Moreover, most of the public reports are simplified and lack location diagrams, making it difficult for the public to correspond their property and plot numbers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporters searched the Green Network database using &quot;Beijing&quot; as the keyword and found that the vast majority of the 15 preliminary investigation reports displayed on the homepage were only Some are about 2 pages long, including a brief description of basic soil conditions, investigation plans and investigation conclusions; some are as long as 130 pages, or the full text and on-site photos are disclosed in detail. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Guo Lei said that the simplified report lacks data such as sampling point maps and pollutant concentration distribution, making it impossible for outsiders to conduct detailed analysis. It is easy to judge whether the sampling process was standardized based on the photos, but the report did not present sampling photos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;There is still a big gap in the information disclosure intensity and quality of soil environmental investigation reports compared with air, water, environmental assessment and other reports.&quot; Guo Lei suggested, Specific information disclosure specifications should be formulated and a unified release platform for information disclosure should be established. Especially for residential buildings and schools redeveloped from land used by heavily polluting industries, developers need to disclose detailed information, and home buyers and parents of students must make careful choices. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;How &quot;poisonous land&quot; can be turned into &quot;treasure land&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;If soil restoration is in place, there are many cases where &quot;poisonous land&quot; has been transformed into &quot;treasure land&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2008, the Beijing Chemical Plant No. 2, located in the southeastern suburbs of Chaoyang District, Beijing, ceased production, and the land was transferred to the State Administration for Residential Land Development. Dr. Yang Jin, chairman of Simple Testing Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., has participated in the soil environment investigation and testing work of this project. Yang Jin introduced that the soil investigation and restoration of this project lasted for many years and cost more than 1 billion yuan. On the land Guanghua New City Community was built and residents will move in at the end of 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Transforming a &quot;poisonous land&quot; into a &quot;treasure land&quot; requires a long process of assessment and restoration. The investigation of soil pollution alone will go through three stages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The first stage is pollution identification, which is mainly based on data collection, on-site surveys and personnel interviews; if possible pollution sources are found in or around the plot, then Entering the second stage of contamination confirmation, it is divided into preliminary and detailed sampling analysis, and the preparation of a soil pollution status investigation report; the third stage is mainly supplementary sampling and testing to obtain the parameters required to meet risk assessment and soil and groundwater remediation. The investigation work in the first stage can be carried out separately or simultaneously during the second stage investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yang Jin introduced that the sampling density for the preliminary investigation of soil pollution conditions is small, generally a 40m×40m grid layout, which is equivalent to the area of ​​four basketball courts. For a sample, it usually takes 2-3 months from the formulation of the plan to the release of the analysis results. If contaminants are detected in the preliminary investigation, detailed investigation is required. The sampling density is increased to a 20m×20m grid, which is equivalent to the area of ​​a basketball court to collect one sample. Local key areas may be denser. This step is time-consuming. About 3-6 months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the soil pollution status investigation and risk assessment are completed, soil remediation must be carried out. Depending on the land area and remediation goals, the remediation work may take as short as one or two years. , the length may exceed ten years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/cb4dd94913.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/cb4dd94913.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259105&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;In July 2022, Hefei, Anhui, at the contaminated soil treatment and restoration site in the former industrial production area of ​​Yaohai District, The staff analyzed the soil at room temperature. Visual China/Picture&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are currently more than 100 soil remediation technologies, and there are more than ten commonly used technologies, which can be roughly divided into physical There are three methods: chemical and biological. The technical principle is to transfer, absorb, degrade and transform pollutants in the soil, reducing their concentration to acceptable levels, or converting toxic and harmful pollutants into harmless substances. According to the remediation mode, it can be divided into in-situ and ex-situ remediation. The difference lies in whether the contaminated soil is moved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The effectiveness of soil remediation also needs to be evaluated. my country implements a soil pollution risk management and restoration list system for construction land. Contaminated plots on the list must pass the review organized by the provincial ecological environment department and meet the established management and control or restoration goals. Only after the risks are controllable can they be removed from the list and developed and utilized. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;It is difficult for the public to judge the quality of reports&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Even if a soil environmental survey has been conducted and the information has been disclosed relatively well, the quality of the reports varies. Qi, the professional threshold is high, and it is difficult for the public to understand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;These reports are prepared by professional companies and have passed expert review. Let alone the general public, let us look for problems in the reports. In fact, there is no It’s easy to find.” Guo Lei admitted that it is difficult for ordinary residents to judge whether the quality of the report is up to standard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Pollutants in the soil are different from the atmosphere and water and are not evenly distributed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Gao Jie, secretary-general of Zhongguancun Zhongxin Soil Remediation Industry Technology Innovation Alliance, told Southern Weekend reporters that soil is multi-phase and heterogeneous, and pollutants are underground , invisible to the naked eye. During the soil investigation process, contaminants may not be discovered in time due to factors such as technology and cost constraints. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Soil remediation has certain uncertainties, and there is no guarantee that it will be &quot;repaired&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yang Jin said that in reality, there is a phenomenon that after soil remediation is completed and then tested, the pollutants still exceed the standard, and even the organic pollutants in some areas &quot;increase as the soil is repaired.&quot; &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are two main types of pollutants in soil - heavy metals and organic matter. Heavy metals have weak mobility and are relatively simple to repair. Generally, there are chemical curing methods, leaching methods, separation methods, etc. Since organic matter has strong mobility, thermal desorption, chemical oxidation or biological remediation methods are generally used. Organic pollutants may migrate with groundwater and other media. The soil extraction process may cause disturbance to underground pollutants, which may cause them to migrate to a wider range. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Gao Jie suggested that awareness of soil pollution prevention and control should be strengthened during the development process. For example, when digging and turning the soil, pay attention to observe whether the color and smell are abnormal, and be equipped with XRF, Rapid screening instruments such as PID can quickly determine whether soil is contaminated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Supervisory authorities should check things in advance. According to GreenNet statistics, since 2019, land use rights holders of more than 300 plots across the country have been punished by the ecological environment department for failing to conduct soil pollution surveys or risk assessments before redevelopment of the plots. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Even if the reported problems are discovered, the house may have been built by then, and the difficulty of solving the problem has become more complicated.&quot; Guo Lei said that at present, The ecological environment department is improving the supervision system and requires survey companies to file sampling plans in advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In July 2022, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment issued the &quot;Guidelines for Preliminary Investigation, Supervision and Inspection of Soil Pollution Conditions in Construction Land (Trial)&quot;, stipulating that municipal ecological environment authorities Carry out supervision and inspection on the sampling and analysis work plan, on-site sampling, and laboratory testing and analysis. For investigation reports that have passed the review, the provincial ecological and environmental authorities can organize random inspections. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition to supervision by local environmental protection departments, Green Network will also report similar clues discovered. &quot;It is possible that some plots that should have been subject to soil environmental surveys but were not, were not discovered by either us or the environmental protection department,&quot; Guo Lei said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Guo Lei explained that there are two important reasons why soil pollution surveys were not conducted before development: First, soil pollution surveys are not subject to the same regulations as planning permits and construction permits. It is widely known that many developers do not know that soil pollution surveys are required, and legal education and publicity need to be further strengthened. Second, many local ecological environment departments do not fully grasp land change information and need to share information with natural resource departments. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Is it worthwhile to develop highly polluting land plots?&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yang Jin observed that when the real estate industry was booming in the past few years, land plots in highly polluting industries Also very popular. &quot;Even if soil environmental investigation and restoration take several years and cost hundreds of millions or even billions, it is still difficult to dampen the enthusiasm of developers because of the huge returns.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left ;&quot;>;Nowadays, local governments and developers are also reflecting on whether it is worth paying such a large cost to repair a difficult and uncertain soil in order to develop residential buildings and bear subsequent risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The &quot;Regulations on the Prevention and Control of Soil Pollution in Jiangsu Province&quot; that will be implemented on September 1, 2022 stipulates that non-ferrous metal mining and processing, non-ferrous metal smelting, and petroleum shall be strictly controlled. Land with serious soil pollution in mining, petroleum processing, chemical industry, coking, electroplating, tanning, pesticides, lead batteries, steel, hazardous waste utilization and disposal and other industries should not be planned as residential areas, schools, kindergartens, hospitals, Land used for nursing homes and sanatoriums can be used to expand ecological space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Of course, even if you are unfortunate enough to live in a house built on a soil-contaminated land, residents do not need to panic too much. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Guo Lei said that if you live on a high floor, you are far away from the surface. Even if there are volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds in the soil, when you reach the high floor, The concentration is also very low. For houses built on &quot;poisonous land&quot;, the basements, gardens and green belts will be most affected.

Unexpectedly, there was insufficient funds in the first year of construction. Despite being in arrears with tens of millions of project funds, the scenic spot still barely opened for business at the end of 2019. At the opening, colorful balloons floated in the air, and hundreds of people watched the red-faced Guan Gong perform his machete on the red carpet. The scene was lively.

In order to let tourists experience the feeling of &quot;pointing the country&quot;, the scenic spot has also built thousands of replicas of terracotta warriors and horses. Accompanying the &quot;terracotta warriors and horses&quot; are nearly 500 &quot;statues of emperors from past dynasties&quot;.

Some tourists once complained on the review software, which is equivalent to forcing people to spend money to take a sightseeing bus. In early November 2023, a Southern Weekend reporter sat on a villager&#39;s motorcycle and visited less than 10 scenic spots, which took more than 3 hours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the scenic spot was temporarily closed in June 2022, the &quot;terracotta warriors and horses&quot;, &quot;seven fairies&quot; and &quot;emperors and generals&quot; were left in the barren mountains and ridges without anyone. Take care of it and live next to wind, rain, weeds, insects and ants. When Southern Weekend reporters visited the scenic spot, they only met two or three villagers in the scenic spot. The local villagers did not embark on the road to wealth. Instead, they were owed many years of land rent. Now the villagers are re-cultivation in many places in the scenic area and have planted rapeseed, a local cash crop. They said that this year, rapeseed can be sold for 3 yuan per pound. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 9, 2023, an aerial photo was taken of the ancient famous Tianxia Scenic Area.

Under the promotion of the scenic area promoters, perhaps investors believe that the scenic area has a bright future. Southern Weekend reporters learned from multiple judgments and on-site construction personnel that the investors attracted by the scenic spot tend to be older. Some retired men were defrauded of 210,000 yuan to buy &quot;health products&quot; and then invested tens of thousands more yuan in scenic spots. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 9, 2023, some local residents occasionally came to the park to hang out.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/20/cdcad5f48d.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/cdcad5f48d .jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258927&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On November 9, 2023, some local residents occasionally came to the park to hang out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The scenes of abandoned scenic spots were spread through the Internet, attracting some explorers.

Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Weng Huan&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhongjiang County in Sichuan Province was once the county with the largest number of people who have not been lifted out of poverty, apart from the national and provincial poverty-stricken counties in Sichuan. There is a scenic spot in the mountains here, spanning three counties and three towns, with a planned area of ​​15.3 square kilometers, equivalent to the size of 15 Forbidden City. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is known as &quot;the only imperial cultural area in the world&quot; and includes nearly 2,000 statues, including nearly 500 portraits of emperors and generals, thousands of imitation &quot;terracotta warriors and horses&quot;, and more than 3 meters high. Images such as &quot;Seven Fairies&quot; and &quot;Eight Immortals&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But it was not completed. No one cared about it for many years. The statue gradually peeled off and faded, disappearing in the grass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2021, someone asked on the official website of &quot;Ask Politics in Sichuan&quot;: &quot;The ancient Fengdian Town in Zhongjiang, Sichuan is famous all over the world. What is the reason why it has not been completed for many years?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fengdian Town is famous all over the world. The town government responded in November that the capital chain of the scenic spot builder was broken, with about 28 million yuan in arrears in project payments and more than 80 million yuan in arrears in financing, involving more than 2,700 people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is even more surprising is that the judgment document website states that the legal representative of the developer was sentenced at the end of 2019 for illegally occupying agricultural land for the construction of a scenic spot. While he was on probation, he was still actively soliciting investment. In June 2022, the scenic spot announced its temporary closure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How was such a behemoth built?

According to promotional materials, the project was launched in 2014 with a total planned investment of approximately 3.1 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Its location is relatively remote, more than an hour&#39;s drive from the center of Deyang and surrounding cities, such as Chengdu and Guanghan. Drive from the Fengdian section exit of Zhongjiang County on the Hurong Expressway and turn right. You will see 9 golden bull elephant sculptures, which are the main entrance of the scenic spot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The tour loop is 19 kilometers long. Welcome to take the sightseeing bus.&quot; A line of golden characters at the main entrance reminds tourists of the scale of the scenic spot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main entrance is built in imitation of ancient city walls, with couplets in red letters on a gold background hanging on both sides: North, south, east, west, there is no other place in the world, but this place has existed in the world throughout the ages. After the scenic spot was temporarily closed, the gates were locked and items in the ticket room were smashed. Nearby villagers gather under the &quot;golden elephant&quot; to chat, and occasionally give directions to curious tourists from out of town. &quot;You can climb over the wall.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beside the Jade Dragon Gate at the entrance of the scenic spot, the Fengdian Town Government posted a notice in March 2023, warning tourists not to enter the scenic spot in any way, because the current infrastructure is incomplete and there are major safety risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Someone opened a trail from the left side of Jade Dragon Gate.

Qin Emperor and Han Wu invite you to point out the country together.&quot; According to the scenic spot promotion, there are nearly 500 statues here, including Emperor Gaozong of the Tang Dynasty, Wu Zetian, Taizu of the Song Dynasty, etc. The emperors of modernization also include the leaders of the &quot;Five Hus and Sixteen Kingdoms&quot; and the &quot;Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hong Hai participated in the construction of about 100 emperor statues from the Tang Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty and stayed in the scenic spot for more than two months. He recalled to Southern Weekend reporters on the phone that the developer was inspired by &quot;Pictures of Emperors of the Past&quot; by Yan Liben, a painter from the Tang Dynasty, and wanted to present the emperors of the past dynasties in the form of sculptures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The statue is placed in a cement field called &quot;Chinese Historical Process Park&quot;. The scenic spot hopes to allow tourists to appreciate five thousand years of Chinese culture by displaying the emperor&#39;s style and introducing his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But if tourists look carefully, they will laugh. For example, Emperor Gong of the Sui Dynasty Yang You (605-619) only lived 15 years old, but the statue of Yang You in the scenic area has a thick long beard and wrinkles on his face, making him look like a mature uncle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The text introduction is not rigorous enough. For example, in the introduction to Song Taizu, &quot;Zhao Kuangyin practiced martial arts when he was young, and first joined Guo Wei, Taizu of the Northern Zhou Dynasty. Later, he followed Chai Rong, Emperor Shizong of the Zhou Dynasty, to fight in various places, and made many military exploits. There were commanders and envoys in front of the palace, and he mastered ice boxing.&quot; Not only is the sentence incomplete, it also contains typos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, Hong Hai said that he and his team were not involved in the coloring and text introduction of the statue. The appearance of the emperor was also built based on the drawings provided by the scenic spot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He introduced that the raw materials of these imperial statues are mainly steel bars and cement, which are cheaper than copper. He did not disclose the total price, citing commercial confidentiality. Due to lack of maintenance and management, hundreds of emperors are now living with dead grass. Under the sun and rain, the acrylic paint on many statues has faded, exposing gray cement, and steel bars are also exposed at the joints of the bases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not far from the emperor&#39;s statue, nearly a thousand &quot;terracotta warriors and horses&quot; are quietly guarding in the mud. These &quot;terracotta warriors and horses&quot; imitate armored warrior warriors, wearing battle uniforms, armor, and hair tied in high buns. However, compared with the various terracotta warriors and horses in the Qin Shihuang Mausoleum in Xi&#39;an, the &quot;Terracotta Warriors and Horses Sichuan&quot; are rough in workmanship, lack details in their expressions and costumes, and are weak in momentum. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scenic spot once attracted tourists with the gimmick that &quot;you can see the Terracotta Warriors and Horses without leaving Sichuan&quot;. Now these replicas are surrounded by moss and wild grass on the edge of the mountain forest, and some have white thatch inserted into their hands. &quot;Qin Shihuang&quot;, who was wearing a dragon robe, had a red ribbon &quot;praying for peace&quot; wrapped around his bun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a sign under the feet of &quot;Qin Shihuang&quot; that reads: &quot;No destruction of property!&quot; However, due to no one taking care of them, these imitations have faded and have cracks in many places. Some &quot;Kneeling Shooting Figurines&quot; were cut off at the waist, and many &quot;Warrior Figurines&quot; lost their arms and even their heads. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In early November 2023, Southern Weekend reporters also saw giant sculptures placed in scenic spots such as Seven Fairies, Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea, Mother Earth, Chang&#39;e Flying to the Moon, Queens of the Four Seasons, and Zhuzi Square. They are three to four meters high, but the workmanship is rough when seen up close. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the publicity, there are more than 20 scenic spots in the scenic area, such as the Drunken Concubine, the Sifang Wealth Saint, the Yue Laotai, the Nine Fox Fairy Cave, and the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl. &quot;Their huge lineup and magnificent momentum are truly unmatched throughout the ages. Unparalleled.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While making emperor statues for Gu Ming Tian Xia, Hong Hai saw the terracotta warriors and horses and other statues being moved into the scenic spot. He has been engaged in the sculpture industry for nearly 20 years and lamented, &quot;I have never seen anything that requires so many sculptures.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the publicity of the scenic spot, the ancient name of the world is based on the five thousand years of Chinese civilization as the core theme, integrating the Chinese cultural story line into the natural ecology and cultural landscape, allowing the story to connect, empower and cast the soul of the landscape. Thus forming an internal logical connection. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Driving local people to get rich&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Developers came to this town in 2014. According to (2019) Sichuan 0623 Xingchu No. 409 Judgment, on March 7, 2014, Sichuan Gumingtianxia Investment Management Co., Ltd. signed an investment cooperation framework agreement with the Fengdian Town Government of Zhongjiang County. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhongjiang County is a major agricultural county in the hilly areas of Sichuan.

One villager said that the land on the mountain was basically unable to grow food and was originally abandoned with no income. The scenic spot also hired local people to do cleaning, maintenance and other work, providing some jobs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scenic spot also mentioned in its publicity that it will &quot;drive local people to become rich.&quot; The economy of Zhongjiang County is relatively backward.

Local media in Dazhou reported his story twice. In 1980, Zhou Lizhu worked as a cashier in a mining company in Dazhou, earning more than 60 yuan a month. But he felt &quot;so tired&quot; that he resigned after five months and set up a leather factory. Zhou Lizhu was only 17 years old at the time and was called the &quot;Doll Factory Manager&quot; by her 10 workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Mr. Zhou Lizhu, who has been in business for a long time, has a heroic spirit between his brows, and his beard makes his outline more subtle and elegant.&quot; According to the scenic spot promotion article, Zhou Lizhu has since He has worked in communication equipment, steel manufacturing, real estate, tourism and other industries, and has also studied in the EMBA class of Xiamen University and Peking University Guanghua School of Management. However, according to the verdict, Zhou Lizhu only had a junior high school education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to &quot;well-known entrepreneur&quot;, another label attached to Zhou Lizhu is &quot;philanthropist&quot;.

According to the remarks, the project unit can handle environmental protection, urban planning, land use, construction permit and other procedures in accordance with the law based on the notice. Construction of projects with incomplete relevant procedures shall not begin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The notice is valid for one year. During the validity period, if there are important changes (including changes in the project investment entity, construction location, main construction content, product technical solutions, and the expected change in the total investment or construction scale of the project by more than 20%, etc.), the project unit should apply for re- Filing. In October 2016, Gumingtianxia applied for re-registration, and the original planned land use of 2,400 acres was changed to 3,590.5 acres. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another document obtained by Southern Weekend reporters showed that in August 2016, the Zhongjiang County Tourism Bureau sent a letter to Gu Ming Tian Xia, &quot;In principle, we agree that your company will invest in the development of Gu Ming Tian Xia Tourism in Fengdian Town.&quot; Tourism &#39;Project&#39;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the fourth year of signing the contract, the scenic spot was found to have illegally occupied agricultural land. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The aforementioned judgment stated that, “In addition to planting wintersweet, crabapple and other agricultural planting projects on the rented land, the company also carried out agricultural projects from 2014 to 2018 without obtaining any construction land approval documents and procedures. During the year, the use nature of the original leased land was changed and construction projects were started.&amp;nbsp;&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, through the appraisal led by the former Deyang City Land and Resources Bureau and Zhongjiang County Forest Public Security Bureau, the scenic spot involved the occupation of damaged cultivated land. The area is 140.1595 acres, involving an occupied forest area of ​​18,360 square meters (approximately 27.54 acres). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These two parts of the area actually account for a very small proportion in the scenic spot, accounting for approximately 4.67% of the registered planned land area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2019, the Zhongjiang County People’s Court sentenced Gu Mingtianxia to the crime of illegal occupation of agricultural land and was fined 50,000 yuan; Zhou Lizhu was sentenced to two years and six months in prison, suspended for three years, and fined Ten thousand yuan in gold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past four years involving illegal construction, the scenic spot has still received support from the local government many times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the public account of the scenic spot, in February 2016, the then Secretary of the Zhongjiang County Party Committee brought an inspection team to the scenic spot for guidance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the official website of Zhongjiang County Government, on August 9, 2016, the former deputy county magistrate presided over the Gumingtianxia project construction promotion meeting and listened to the project planning unit’s status report, the project investor’s construction plan report and related Opinions and suggestions from department heads. The meeting requested that relevant departments should work together to coordinate and solve problems existing in project construction to ensure the smooth progress of the construction project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liao Xing, one of the original managers of the scenic spot, told Southern Weekend reporters that the scenic spot did not clearly occupy basic farmland at the beginning of its construction. &quot;If he (the government) does not agree, does he dare to touch the land?&quot; Liao Xing said. Since 2014, she has followed Zhou Lizhu to work in Gumingtianxia, ​​mainly responsible for project management. After being owed wages, she resigned in 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2017, the State Council issued the &quot;Opinions on Strengthening the Protection of Cultivated Land and Improving the Balance of Acquisition and Compensation&quot; to implement the strictest cultivated land protection system. According to the official website of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Land and Resources in September 2018, the Deyang Municipal Land and Resources Bureau paid close attention to the protection of cultivated land. In that year, the city carried out 685 dynamic inspections, discovered and stopped 10 land violations, and filed 4 cases for investigation and punishment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liao Xing and the above-mentioned investment personnel said that after Gu Mingtianxia and Zhou Lizhu were sentenced and paid fines, the local government had adjusted the basic farmland and forestland occupied by the scenic spot into general land. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the publicity materials of the scenic spot, on April 10, 2020, members of the Standing Committee of the Zhongjiang County Party Committee, Minister of Propaganda, Director of the County Culture and Tourism Bureau, and Deputy Director of the County Natural Resources Bureau visited the ancient Mingtianxia Scenic Spot to guide the work and provide opinions. Or suggest that Zhou Lizhu and others accompany him. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Twenty million is owed to build the scenic spot&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2015, the construction team began to enter the site. However, the construction of the scenic spot was carried out illegally at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A judgment shows that in August 2015, Chongqing Jingwu Industrial (Group) Co., Ltd. signed a contract with Gumingtianxia, ​​agreeing to undertake the construction of anti-corrosion cabin projects for office buildings, hotels, and commercial streets in scenic spots. However, because Gu Ming Tianxia did not obtain the approval procedures for the construction of the office building, the competent authorities prohibited the construction, and Chongqing Jingwu Industrial immediately stopped the construction of the office building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Afterwards, the two parties signed a contract, agreeing to outsource the road pavement projects in the scenic area to Chongqing Jingwu Industrial. After June 2019, Chongqing Jingwu Industrial completed the roadbed construction, but because Gumingtianxia did not provide construction drawings and did not connect electricity for construction, it was unable to continue to complete the road pavement construction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Rong was once one of the management members of the scenic spot. He told Southern Weekend reporters that because the scenic spot is a tourism project for investment promotion by the local government, the policy may be more liberal and construction will start first. He wants to build it first and then build it later. formalities. At present, Wang Rong is still owed about 100,000 yuan in salary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Wang Rong admitted that the scenic spot violated the relevant regulations on temporary land use at the beginning of its construction. &quot;There is no planning or construction report.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, Gumingtianxia is facing a shortage of funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the above-mentioned judgment, in October 2016, Guming Tianxia issued an IOU to Chongqing Jingwu Industrial and admitted that it owed 2.6158 million yuan in project payment and 100,000 yuan in deposit. After returning the deposit, Gu Mingtianxia has been in arrears with the project payment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned from many construction parties that they had agreed with Gumingtianxia to &quot;advance funds first and then settle the settlement.&quot; Li Chengwu, a native of Sichuan, is in his fifties and has been in this business for more than 30 years, mainly contracting earthwork construction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He saw that Zhou Lizhu had two companies under his name and thought he was quite strong. By the end of 2016, Li Chengwu counted the account, and the cushion had been nearly 5 million yuan. At this time, Zhou Lizhen still couldn&#39;t pay. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Near the New Year, Jiang Tao, who is responsible for infrastructure projects, and Yang Tinghong, who is doing the green sand and slab material paving project. Zhou Lizhu&#39;s accounts owed to them were 2.9 million and 270,000, respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Later, Li Chengwu and others began to report the situation to the government. On September 1, 2017, at the Labor Security Bureau of Zhongjiang County, the ancient name of the world promised Li Chengwu to pay off the project funds before August 30, 2018. After the signature of Zhou Liyu, he wrote the word &quot;agree&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At present, there are 88 &quot;ancient names in the world&quot; where Li Chengwu and others are located, including construction teams such as garden greening, doors and windows, hardening roads, and green slate for the scenic area. In November 2023, a boss who made doors and windows for the scenic spot counted a data in the group. At least 22 construction teams were arrears of engineering funds, wages and margin for about 20 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The owner of multiple construction team told reporters from the southern weekend that the reason why the construction team continued to enter the market in 2017 was because the quotation of ancient names was 5%-10%higher than that of the market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the referee document network, since the second half of 2017, the construction party sued Zhou Lizhen and the ancient world in the world and won the lawsuit. Several plaintiffs applied for compulsory enforcement, but the court failed to find any property and property clues under the name of the person. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Not only the construction party, the villagers from Huangping Village, Fengdian Town from 2017, will not get the rent of the scenic area. The above -mentioned scenic spot investment personnel said that about 90 % of the scenic spots were built in Fengdian Town, and so far owed about 9 million yuan in land rent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;The scenic area across three counties and three towns, which is comparable to 15 Forbidden City.

Southern Weekend reporter Weng Yan &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Why is the ancient famous world lacking money? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; According to the judgment, the ancient names originally planned to invest 370 million yuan in Fengdian Town. However, according to the scenic spot, the total investment of the plan is about 3.1 billion yuan, which is divided into four -phase engineering construction scenic spot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;He has a lot of things, engage in leather factories, sell steel, sell communications, and also engage in crowdfunding.&quot; Dazhou native Qiu Song is Zhou Lizhen&#39;s fellow, and he recalled to reporters from the south weekend. Lizhen opened a company in Dazhou, and then went to Fengdian to run the scenic spot. Qiu Song made a steel frame structure for the scenic area, and now it is also owed about 1 million yuan by the ancient world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A Dazhou person brought Zhou Liyu to court in 2018. According to the judgment, since December 2013, Zhou Lizhen has a total of 1.2 million yuan from the plaintiff&#39;s father&#39;s father, and will compensate the three houses in Tongchuan District, Dazhou City. However, the plaintiff found that the owner of the mortgaged property was not Zhou Liyu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Li Chengwu also heard Zhou Liyu said that he had developed real estate projects in Dazhou. In order to collect debt, Li Chengwu arrived several times to find Zhou Lizhen&#39;s real estate. &quot;Later, I knew it was upset. He had no projects in Dazhou to draw money.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Li Chengwu has also been to Hainan, because Zhou Lizheng claims that there are 16 houses in a certain real estate in Sanya. Several sets of repayment. After he went, he found that the person who guarded the real estate was Zhou Lizhen&#39;s fellow, and the real estate had nothing to do with Zhou Liyu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Wang Rong said that Zhou Lizhen had a financing company in Dazhou, and the money of raising 3 points of interest was borrowed to others with 5 or 8 points. But later, bad debts could not be collected. In addition, he squandered partly, which led to hundreds of millions of yuan in investors. So Zhou Lizheng thought that he could go to the scenic spot, and claimed that the financing funds were invested in the construction of the scenic spot. &quot;Write a promise to those who owe money. The scenic area will give you a shares. After the park is opened, give you dividends every year.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &quot;Disassembling the east wall to make up the west wall, the capital hole is getting bigger and bigger.&quot; On the weekend, the reporter learned from an official in Fengdian Town as an investor that Zhou Liyu initially took about 40 million yuan to build the scenic spot. After the money was used, he went to raise funds in Mianyang, Deyang, Suining, Chengdu, Nanchong and other places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Tianyancha shows that from 2017-2018, Zhou Lizhen registered companies related to ancient worlds in Deyang, Chengdu, Mianyang, and Suining, respectively. According to the Fengdian Town Government, the financing funds arrears in ancient names reached more than 80 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Liao Xing said that he did not know the source of Zhou Li&#39;s funds. He mentioned that because of road construction, the scenic area had received a road subsidy of about 1 million yuan in the local government, but in addition, he did not enjoy other subsidies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Jiang Tao, who is responsible for infrastructure engineering, said that he had seen two tourist bus parked in the scenic area in 2017, and was an investor in the ancient world. &quot;Luck the money for the elderly.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; On the referee document network, there are 3 civil loan disputes related to ancient famous worlds. The three judgments show that in March, May, and June 2019, the ancient world borrowed 100,000, 10,000, and 100,000, respectively, and all promised an annual interest rate of 24%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Coincidentally, these three plaintiffs are older, and they are 71 years old, 60, and 63 years old. Two of them are Mianyang, one is from Deyang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the blog Chinese website, an investor who visited the scenic area in October 2018 recorded the visit. At that time, the construction of the scenic spot was initially completed. The promotion staff said that the scenic spot was built by Zhou Liyu. The original funds were sufficient. However, due to the continuous rise in raw materials and industrial prices in recent years, the funds have occurred, so they borrowed money from the people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The investor saw a retired elderly in his seventy -year -old retired elderly who voted for 30,000.

Tianfu Stock Exchange Center is a regional equity market operating institution that provides financing channels for small and medium -sized enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the above three judgments, by January 2020, the ancient world&#39;s world failed to pay interest on the three plaintiffs as agreed, nor could they repay the principal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Where did Zhou Lizhen&#39;s money spent? Liao Xing said that the money was invested in the project, and the project funds were not paid all, but it also ended. For example, he said that regardless of transportation and installation fees, the production cost of each emperor&#39;s statue is about 10,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Dan Wang Rong said that before 2017, the investment in the scenic spot in the scenic spot of the ancient world was not more than 5 million yuan. &quot;At that time, the government did not ask for capital inspection. In the end, he couldn&#39;t get a penny.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Li Chengwu heard Zhou Lizhu said that the scenic area was originally planned to open in May 2017. But it was not until the end of 2019 that it was officially operated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Liao Xing said that the company&#39;s capital chain was broken because the scenic area was affected by the epidemic, and there was no income. &quot;After repairing the road, planting trees, the project was all there, and he didn&#39;t take it away.&quot; He felt that Zhou Lizheng was &quot;the person who wanted to do things.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Wang Rong believes that Zhou Liyu is a guise to circle money outside the scenic area, and he is not serious about making scenic spots. &quot;Except for the statue, the tourists will not come for the second time.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Liao Xing also had doubts about the development of the scenic area. &quot;Indeed, the plan is too big.&quot; He had received other companies where the scenic area visited, and the other party told him that to complete the planning of the scenic spot, at least it would be 1 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In addition to the &quot;Terracotta Warriors&quot;, the ancient names of the world originally planned to build a Zen Medical Kangyang Ecological Park, low -altitude sports base, Huaxia History and Culture Research Travel Base, Grand Theater, Ancient Shaolin Temple and other attractions. Liao Xing said that the large purpose of the scenic area was to retain tourists overnight, and tourists lived before they lived. However, until the scene of the scenic area was closed, the ancient names have not yet built a hotel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In fact, the scenic spot is not much attractive to tourists. In the East Square, the reporter from the Southern Weekend saw several discarded tickets with a fare of 98 yuan. There are 20 evaluations of the scenic spot in the public comment.

The Fengdian Town Government stated in November 2021 that it is actively urging the ancient world investors to raise funds and financing to resolve debt problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the promotion of the scenic area, in December 2020, Zhou Liyu signed a strategic cooperation agreement on behalf of the Scenic Area and the Chengdu Tourism Association Travel Agency Branch at the 2020 China (Sichuan) tourist scenic spot and the cultural and creative industry innovation development expo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;I have to do everything possible to repay your funds as soon as possible.&quot; In early 2022, Zhou Lizheng wrote a letter to the investment member.

In July, Li Chengwu went to the office to find Zhou Liyu and saw the other party talk to two three investors in the reception room. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The office of the ancient world is located in the &quot;ancient famous courtyard&quot; in the courtyard style. When a reporter from the Southern Weekend visited the &quot;Ancient Famous Courtyard&quot; in early November 2023, the office was empty. The leaflets with yellowish and wrinkled scenic spots were blown into the corner by the wind and rain. There were sheep dung and insect corpses everywhere on the ground. It seemed that the yard had been deserted for a while. The reception room, financial room and other office areas borrowed a piece of wolf. The overthrow -pushed office cabinets, crushed glass everywhere, and scattered paper showed fierce conflict traces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The feet of &quot;Four Seasons Girls&quot; are another office place in the ancient world. Nowadays, the renderings of the scenic area and a calligraphy of the scenic area are hung in the room. It is likely that there are also conflicts here. The jewelry cabinet of sterling silver bracelets and the natural Gobi red agate was broken, and the empty jewelry box and price were signed to the ground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the Zhongjiang County Government Network, on the morning of July 23, 2022, the Standing Committee of the County Party Committee, Minister of Propaganda, and Chairman of the County Federation of Trade Unions went to Fengdian Town to hold a &quot;Ancient World&quot; petition stable work site coordination meeting. The Bureau, the County Cultural and Travel Bureau, the County Natural Resources Bureau, the county and other departments and other departments coordinated the meeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In September of the same year, the news of Zhou Lizhen appeared last time in the public account of the scenic spot.

At that time, Zhou Lizhen was 56 years old. But Wang Rong believes that Zhou Lizhen is to hide the news of debt. On November 11, 2023, a reporter from the Southern Weekend dialed Zhou Lizhen&#39;s mobile phone number, and the other party denied that he was Zhou Lizhu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the above -mentioned scenic spot investment personnel and Fengdian town officials, the scenic spot has not been found.
