Special action. The relevant matters are now notified as follows. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;1. Clear work goals&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Focus on cyber violence We will focus on key sections where anger easily breeds, strictly crack down on prominent issues such as malicious attacks and insults, provoking group confrontations, and venting extreme emotions, and resolutely punish a number of illegal accounts, groups, and website platforms to effectively curb the spread of online violence. By carrying out special rectification, we will further consolidate the main responsibilities of the website platform, thoroughly identify problems and loopholes, improve the system and mechanism to prevent and control online violence, effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of the majority of netizens, and maintain a good online ecology. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;2. Focus on rectifying 7 types of outstanding problems&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>; The special actions focus on key platform types such as social networking, short videos, and live broadcasts, and resolutely crack down on the following seven aspects of problems:&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;1. &quot;Internet toilets&quot; and &quot;open boxes to hang people&quot; &quot;Behavior. Create special BOT accounts, post bars, topics, groups, etc., and receive and publish sarcastic, malicious comments, curses and insults targeting specific groups or individuals through anonymous contributions, remote shouting, etc. In the name of exposure and criticism, they maliciously &quot;open the box&quot; and &quot;hang people&quot;, publicizing other people&#39;s names, ID numbers, mobile phone numbers, home addresses, workplaces, personal photos, social accounts and other personal privacy information, inciting netizens to attack and abuse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2. Use hot social events to maliciously slander and spread rumors. Spread rumors and slander relevant parties involved in emergencies, or edit and process pictures and videos that are seriously inconsistent with the facts, to induce netizens to attack and question the parties involved. Use the image of the parties involved in hot events to create and publish emoticons, and use AI software to synthesize fake pictures or videos such as vulgar pornography, bloody horror, etc., to carry out rumors, attacks, and slander. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;3. Stigmatize specific groups and incite regional confrontation. Associate individual vicious social events and negative figures with gender, occupation, region and other characteristics, stigmatize and negatively label specific groups, publish gender-antagonistic, class-antagonistic, and regionally discriminatory remarks, carry out generalized attacks, and intensify social conflicts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;4. Vulgar and bad live streaming behaviors such as fierce PK. Online anchors use behaviors such as showing off their courage, fighting, drinking, and swearing to increase their followers and traffic. During other people&#39;s live broadcasts, they use functions such as barrages and mics to conduct personal attacks, and even encourage extreme behaviors such as suicide and self-harm. Make up scripts of violent conflicts such as fights and fights to attract netizens to watch and disrupt public order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;5. Organized and malicious abuse and reporting of others. In the name of &quot;helping with work&quot; and &quot;relieving worries and anger&quot;, they provide paid scolding services and leave abusive messages and private message attacks on specific accounts. Organize fan groups to use the platform’s “reporting” and “anti-gangster” functions to maliciously report others in batches. Publish comments that provoke war and malicious hype in the fields of entertainment, sports, e-sports, etc., inducing fans to quarrel with each other and control reviews. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;6. Make up Internet slang and maliciously create rumors. Through pinyin, homophony, pronouns, etc., maliciously fabricate vulgar memes and bad buzzwords to pollute the Internet atmosphere. Use obscene language and foul language to deliberately provoke conflicts and create conflict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;7. Inciting extreme emotions online. Make up sensational post titles and publish &quot;venting posts&quot; that are made out of nothing and have no bottom line. Maliciously exaggerating the conflicts between teachers and students, exaggerating parents&#39; &quot;oppression&quot; and &quot;squeezing&quot; of their children, provoking conflicting relationships, and forming a negative direction for minors. Deliberately exaggerate negativity, anxiety and resentment, and spread hateful and antagonistic remarks. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;3. Severely punish illegal accounts, groups and platforms in accordance with the law&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Special During the operation, we must persist in striking hard, close a group of account groups that seriously violate regulations and have a bad influence, resolutely ban a group of functional sections that gather violence and have outstanding problems, and strictly investigate and punish a group of people who fail to perform their responsibilities and have serious problems. The website platform that resists the temptation to commit crimes forms a powerful deterrent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1. Strictly investigate and punish illegal accounts, groups, and post bars. In-depth investigation of high-risk accounts and groups, resolutely ban accounts and groups with themes such as &quot;online toilets&quot;, &quot;opening boxes to hang people&quot;, &quot;inciting fights&quot;, etc., and seriously investigate and deal with anchor accounts that organize ruthless PKs and live broadcast fights , severely punish &quot;self-media&quot; accounts that publish &quot;clickbait&quot; content that deliberately incites online violence, close a group of circles, super chats, and post bars named with insulting words and where online violence gathers, and remove them from the shelves and provide paid compensation. Scolding merchants and shops waiting for services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2. Strictly investigate and deal with illegal function settings. Strengthen the management of key functions such as live broadcast barrage, continuous wheat, and PK, and resolutely clean up and deal with violent content online. Centrally cancel a batch of functional applications that organize malicious reports in batches. It is prohibited to push &quot;online toilet&quot; accounts to users through functions such as &quot;Related Recommendations&quot;, &quot;TA Follows&quot;, and &quot;Potentially Interested People&quot;. Strengthen the review and management of emoticon packages, P-picture puzzles, video editing, AI synthesis and other functions, and clean up and remove emoticon packages, pictures and videos containing prank attacks, provoking confrontation and other content. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;3. Strictly investigate and punish illegal platform links. Urge &lt;span>; website platforms to strengthen the management of lists, topics, recommendations, comments, private messages, etc. It is strictly forbidden to push content that incites and promotes online violence in lists, recommendations, etc., by setting up &quot;private message folding&quot; and &quot;message boxes&quot; etc. to reduce harassment from strangers via private messages. For websites, apps, and mini-programs with outstanding problems, punitive measures such as rectification within a time limit, fines, suspension of relevant functions, and shutdown will be taken in accordance with the law. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;4. Detailed work requirements&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;/ span>;1. Do a good job in deployment and promotion. Based on local reality, we will formulate detailed implementation plans, allocate strong working forces, pay close attention to the deployment and implementation of tasks, organize to evaluate the effectiveness of website platform governance as appropriate, and supervise the implementation of rectifications. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2. Consolidate platform responsibility. Guide local website platforms to comprehensively investigate problems and loopholes, focus on key links, sections and functions, carry out in-depth self-examination and self-correction, improve content management mechanisms, and ensure that special actions achieve effective results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;3. Strengthen publicity and exposure. Announce &lt;span>; the launch and phased progress of special actions, and key platforms publish typical cases every week. Strengthen education and guidance, encourage netizens to actively participate in reporting and complaining, and jointly resist online violence. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Secretary Bureau of the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot; >;&lt;span>;November 10, 2023&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 17 Nov 2023 17:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[马云继续减持，阿里巴巴刺向低价]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260806]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-17 15:30:03&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Alibaba Xixi Park.

Image source: Alibaba official website&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;November 16, 2023, is the day when Alibaba’s new quarterly results for fiscal year 2024 are announced. On this day, many important news about this giant company were simultaneously released. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jack Ma continues to reduce his stake in the founder of Alibaba; the previous &quot;1+6+N&quot; spin-off plan partially pressed the pause button, and Alibaba Cloud will no longer be completely split; the listing of Hema is also suspended. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What changes is Alibaba facing? Where will the strategic baton be waved from now on? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Jack Ma reduced his holdings and cashed out US$870 million&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On November 16, Alibaba (BABA.NYSE) submitted two 144 forms to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), indicating that Jack Ma JC Properties Limited and JSP Investment Limited, subsidiaries of the family trust, plan to sell 5 million shares of the founder of Alibaba each on November 21. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on Alibaba’s closing price of US$87.07 per share on November 15, Eastern Time, the Jack Ma family can cash out US$870.7 million through this reduction. Alibaba’s market capitalization that day was approximately US$221.75 billion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Form 144, also known as &quot;Notice of Proposed Sale of Securities.&quot; SEC regulations stipulate that if directors, executives or major shareholders of a U.S. listed company transfer more than 5,000 shares of listed company stock or a market value of more than $50,000 in any three months, they must fill out Form 144 and report to the SEC. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Alibaba’s U.S. stock prospectus, before the IPO, Jack Ma held a total of 8.8% of Alibaba’s shares in four ways. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I hold 0.08% directly, 1.49% each through APN Ltd registered in the Cayman Islands and SymAsia Foundation, a Singapore non-profit organization, and through JC Properties registered in the British Virgin Islands Limited and JSP Investment Limited hold 2.78% and 2.95% of the shares respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The shares sold by Jack Ma in the US stock IPO also came from JC Properties Limited and JSP Investment Limited. After the IPO, his shareholding in Alibaba dropped to 7.8%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since Alibaba was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014, Jack Ma has reduced his holdings many times. The financial report shows that Jack Ma’s large-scale reduction of holdings began in 2017. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, Jack Ma’s shareholding dropped from 7.8% to 7%, to 6.4% in 2018, to 6.2% in 2019, and to 4.8% in 2020, which is below the 5% disclosure red line. Since then, Alibaba has not disclosed Jack Ma’s shareholdings in its financial reports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alibaba has responded that Jack Ma and Tsai Chongxin will donate their Alibaba options, which total 2% of the total equity of Alibaba Group, to support environmental protection, medical health, educational development and public welfare. ecology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On Teacher’s Day 2019, Jack Ma resigned as chairman of Alibaba’s board of directors. A year later, Jack Ma completed his term as director and is no longer a member of Alibaba&#39;s board of directors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 2023 financial report shows that Jack Ma is still a member of Alibaba’s partner committee, and the other five are Cai Chongxin, Zhang Yong, Peng Lei, Shao Xiaofeng and Wu Yongming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alibaba implements a partnership system, in which partners nominate the majority of directors on the board of directors, rather than allocating director seats based on the number of shares. Alibaba currently has 28 partners. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Refocus on 1688, Xianyu, DingTalk, and Quark&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Also on November 16, Alibaba’s Q2 results for fiscal year 2024 were announced. Alibaba&#39;s fiscal year is not synchronized with the natural year, ranging from April 1 of each year to March 31 of the following year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This quarter, Alibaba’s revenue was 224.79 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 9%. Net profit was 26.696 billion yuan, compared with a net loss of 22.467 billion yuan in the same period in 2022, and non-GAAP net profit was 40.188 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 19%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Alibaba Group&#39;s performance this quarter was solid, with multiple businesses showing new momentum and vitality, and proactive self-reform achieving remarkable results.&quot; Wu Yongming, CEO of Alibaba Group, said in the performance announcement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Local Life Group’s revenue increased by 16% year-on-year to 15.564 billion yuan, driven by the strong growth of Ele.me and AutoNavi, with orders increasing by nearly 20% year-on-year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cainiao’s revenue increased by 25% year-on-year to 22.823 billion yuan, mainly driven by cross-border logistics fulfillment solutions. Cainiao launched global 5-day logistics services to 8 countries and regions this quarter, including first-leg collection, trunk transportation, customs clearance, sorting and last-mile delivery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Alibaba Entertainment finally turned a profit in the last quarter, its chances of winning have further expanded. The revenue of Dawen Entertainment Group in this quarter was 5.779 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 11%, mainly due to the offline entertainment business of Damai.com and Alibaba Pictures, and the subscription growth of Youku. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 19, Alibaba Pictures announced the acquisition of Damai.com. Benefiting from the recovery and strong demand of the offline entertainment market during the summer vacation of 2023, Damai.com recorded triple-digit year-on-year growth in GMV this quarter. In August, Damai.com teamed up with Youku to sell tickets for the offline performances and online live broadcasts of TFBOYS’s 10th anniversary concert. This exclusive online live broadcast broke Youku’s online paid performance record. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two films jointly produced by Alibaba Pictures, &quot;All or Nothing&quot; and &quot;The Lost Girl&quot; ranked among the top two at the summer box office. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of November 16, Wu Yongming participated in the quarterly financial analyst conference call for the first time as CEO of Alibaba Group. At the meeting, he introduced Alibaba’s first batch of strategic innovative businesses-1688, Xianyu, Nail, Quark. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Yongming said that Alibaba’s selection criteria for strategic innovative businesses are: having a large enough market space; having unique market positioning; complying with user demand trends and the group’s “AI-driven” strategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The strategic innovative business will be operated as an independent subsidiary in terms of organization. In terms of business, it will break the previous positioning restrictions within the group and use a more independent strategy to face the broad market. Alibaba Group will make continuous investment in a 3-5 year cycle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Quark is an intelligent search app owned by Alibaba, and DingTalk is an enterprise-level intelligent mobile office platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the field of online transactions that Alibaba is good at, 1688 is a purchasing and wholesale network, which is often put together with Pinduoduo to compare which one is cheaper, while Xianyu is a second-hand idle transfer platform, which improves the popularity of the two within the group. The importance of Alibaba’s business shows that Alibaba’s baton is tilted towards the low-price market. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The spin-off of Alibaba Cloud and the listing of Hema will be suspended&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Alibaba’s Q2 financial report also announced the spin-off progress of each business segment. Surprisingly, the spin-off of Alibaba Cloud has been put on hold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 18, Zhang Yong, then chairman and CEO of Alibaba Group and chairman and CEO of Alibaba Cloud Intelligence Group, announced that Alibaba Cloud Intelligence Group would be completely separated from Alibaba Group within the next 12 months. Dismantled and completed listing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alibaba explained in this financial report that the United States has recently expanded restrictions on the export of advanced computing chips, which has brought uncertainty to the prospects of Cloud Intelligence Group. Its complete spin-off may not increase shareholder value as originally envisaged, so it has decided not to promote its complete spin-off. Instead, it will face an uncertain environment and focus on establishing a sustainable growth model for Cloud Intelligence Group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Yongming said that Alibaba Group will maintain long-term and resolute investment in the strategic direction of Alibaba Cloud. At the same time, Cloud Intelligence Group will continue to maintain an independent company operation method and adopt a CEO responsibility system authorized by the board of directors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2023, Bloomberg News stated that Hema was cooperating with CICC, Morgan Stanley and others to prepare for listing and prepare to be listed in Hong Kong next year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this financial report shows that Hema’s initial public offering plan is on hold. Ali did not explain why. But this may have something to do with Hema’s lackluster performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This quarter, Alibaba’s revenue from all other segments was 4.8052 billion yuan, which remained stable compared with the same period in 2022. All other segments include Sun Art Retail, Hema, Alibaba Health, Lingxi Interactive Entertainment, Intime, Intelligent Information (mainly including UC Youshi and Quark businesses), Fliggy, DingTalk, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other segments, the revenue of Hema, Fliggy, Alibaba Health and Smart Information has increased, but the overall performance is only the same as last year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In sharp contrast to Hema, Cainiao Group has applied for an initial public offering in Hong Kong and has submitted an A1 document (listing application form) to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Yongming said at the conference call that Cainiao’s core strategies for the next three years are to accelerate the construction of a global smart logistics network, seize the historical opportunities of the rapid development of cross-border e-commerce, and achieve rapid growth in international business. The second is to adhere to the path of differentiation in the country, export scientific and technological capabilities, and maintain the healthy development of business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 17 Nov 2023 15:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国家卫健委：严厉打击倒买倒卖、伪造出生医学证明等违法犯罪行为]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260797]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-17 14:40:54&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The National Health Commission attaches great importance to the management of birth medical certificates and is supervising relevant places to seriously verify and deal with the trafficking of birth medical certificates.

Many bony vertebrates also have this bitter taste receptor gene, but researchers have never found it in cartilaginous vertebrates before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this study, researchers from the University of Cologne in Germany and other institutions used the latest gene sequencing technology to sequence the genes of 17 species of cartilaginous fish (including sharks and rays) and found that 12 species of cartilaginous fish All carry a taste receptor gene similar to T2R, which they named T2R1.

Under the sensory stimulation of extreme violence, the protagonist takes the audience&#39;s perspective to reveal the truth bit by bit. The plot has twists and turns and even reversals, providing plot excitement. The other layer is to explore the theme of human nature. The protagonist often has some kind of commonality with the victim and murderer of the case. The story of the detective story is also the protagonist&#39;s growth of exploring himself and &quot;finding himself&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the case was finally solved, the protagonist found the truth of the case and the answer to the confusion in life. They point to an ending in the interweaving, and the audience sees two stories and gets a double plot impact. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Those character arcs in drama theory are actually not complicated. Excellent stories not only reveal the truth about the character&#39;s personality, but more importantly, tell the arc or change of the character&#39;s inner nature during the course of the story. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Knowing this, it is easy to understand the director&#39;s intention. In crime films, these two layers are often intertwined, but with different emphasis. For example, &quot;The Mistake on the River&quot; currently in theaters focuses on the latter layer. The director was afraid of being misunderstood, so he directly wrote &quot;No Answer&quot; on the poster. It just reminds the audience that the main purpose of this movie is to explore the human nature related to the case. The investigation itself is not important. There is no need to worry about who the murderer is. There is no answer at all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In comparison, the new film &quot;Pursuit&quot; directed by Zeng Yingting and starring Junning Chang and Ethan Ruan is not so literary and extreme. Although this movie has some fresh topics, it does not challenge the audience&#39;s entertainment interests too much and is a very regular crime film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/65d82de147164b79f0bb63f091c3cc89.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1531&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/65d82de147164b79f0bb63f091c3cc89.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258558&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Female worker accident He died tragically and was involved in a series of female murders. Finger-cutting, heart-breaking, imprisonment...bizarre cases, cruel murderers, and sensory-stimulating gimmicks are all cut into the trailer. Seasoned genre film viewers are very familiar with this method of publicity, and of course they know that a gimmick is just a gimmick, and its scale will only be safe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth mentioning that &quot;The Hunt&quot; is a movie dominated by female characters, and you can even consider it a female movie (although it is very genre). In the crime genre, very few women lead the investigation. We might as well try to recall the positioning of female characters in crime films. They are often victims or perpetrators (which appears as a reversal card at this time). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this crime movie, the protagonist is the detective Wu Jie played by Junning Chang. She is the leader and the soul of the drama. If you put aside your female identity, Zhang Junning&#39;s role is not special. This is a decadent Matthew Scudder-like character who looks like a professional, capable, and tough detective on the outside, but is broken on the inside. We have seen countless similar male characters. The decadent man finds himself and his original intention through handling cases, which is very cliché. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;The Pursuit&quot;, we cannot ignore the gender issue, it is the theme of this movie. The audience is first put into a female perspective. Wu Jie, who has experienced pain in the film, is facing the difficulty of how to survive. She tried to commit suicide in the car. This is the starting point of the character&#39;s story. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Jie encountered the case of an unknown female corpse. Objectively, the instinct of the criminal police prevented the idea of ​​​​suicide. When she starts to handle the case, the story becomes logical and has two layers: one is that Wu Jie is solving the case of the unknown female corpse and wants to find the murderer; the other is that Wu Jie is also facing her spiritual death and trying to find a way to survive. The answer to go down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/55ac85fe659166239979062a3d35d39b.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/55ac85fe659166239979062a3d35d39b.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258556&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stills from &quot;Pursuit&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the movie, detective Wu Jie has a dialogue: &quot;We always say that the corpse will choose someone to handle the case, and she chose me.&quot; Of course the dead would not choose. The fact is that Wu Jie chose this case. She wanted to seek justice for the dead, and her motivation was not only her professional status, but also her responsibility as a woman and her need to heal herself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here, female identity shows special significance. On the surface of the story, a female detective is investigating murder cases against women. Inside, there is a woman who empathizes with women who have been hurt—both physically and emotionally—and ultimately healed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of empathy is not uncommon, but it is difficult to become the main line. There is a scene in &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; where a group of male detectives are drinking coffee and talking during an indoor scene involving a woman&#39;s autopsy. Jodie Foster, who was inside, felt uncomfortable and helpless when she saw the naked female corpse. Finally, she mustered up the courage to clear the men. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be honest, the story itself of &quot;Pursuit&quot; did not give me much new ideas and was very routine. However, the empathy between the female detective Wu Jie and the female victims always reminds me of the scene in &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. The female perspective runs throughout, and this amplified empathy transcends the limitations of the screen, which is beyond the expectations of ordinary crime films. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/039ed79c018630d1e3a528e179f0fb4d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height= &quot;552&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/039ed79c018630d1e3a528e179f0fb4d.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258555&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color ; As a category. They are all movies with female protagonists, and women are the protagonists in an absolute sense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is easy for the audience to take a certain unconscious stance, not because of the performance of the two actors, but because of the female protagonist&#39;s genre film, which not only brings freshness, but also brings strangeness. Feeling unwell. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/9c3085713ee0bf1bd85bcd6b68ee6ac7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;858&quot; height= &quot;452&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/9c3085713ee0bf1bd85bcd6b68ee6ac7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258557&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Type films and There is no need for extraordinary acting skills, it is very craftsmanship, it should be performed, it cannot be missing or wrong. In my eyes, the &quot;craftsmanship&quot; of performances in genre films is a compliment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether it is Zhang Junning or Zhang Xiaofei, they provide a fresh sense of crime themes. Although the story still has loopholes and problems of one kind or another, more and more complete and different types of female protagonists appear in On the screen, this is a good phenomenon that deserves applause. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 17 Nov 2023 11:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[人机连接走到哪一步了？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260684]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-17 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Neuralink, a brain-computer interface company owned by Musk, officially began recruiting volunteers for its first clinical trial. Ideal volunteer candidates are quadriplegic adults under the age of 40. The trial will see most of the volunteers&#39; skulls removed and implanted with a brain-computer implant, a processing, communication and charging system. The device, which is a chip and wires, has more than a thousand electrodes to receive brain data. By comparison, implants from other rival companies have only about 16 electrodes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The thunder that has been ringing has finally turned into raindrops, and the brain-computer interface or human-computer connection will enter the human trial stage. However, implanting a chip in the brain is an invasive procedure that could cause harm to a person if not careful. However, the significance of this research is very important. It can not only decipher the thinking of the human brain, but also make it possible for people to obtain more powerful capabilities with the help of computers and shape the so-called human-machine complex. To this end, we must find a balance between harm and benefits to minimize harm to people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such a balance is the content of medical ethics intervention. In May 2023, Neuralink said that its first human clinical trial was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA); on September 19, Neuralink announced that the company had received approval from an independent review committee and would conduct the trial this year. Conducting the first human trial of a brain-computer interface. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This shows that Neuralink has done enough homework in terms of ethical review and approval. Before doing this kind of homework, we also followed the procedures of medical clinical trials from animals to humans. Before applying for human clinical trials, Neuralink has conducted relevant tests on pigs and monkeys respectively, and achieved certain results. In particular, the tests on monkeys have proven that it can be applied to humans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2021, Neuralink released a video showing a macaque implanted with its device playing video games through telepathy, indicating a major breakthrough in chip implantation in brain control research. The macaque in the video is named Pug, and has a brain-computer interface implanted in his brain. Initially, the research team taught Pug to play games using a game joystick and rewarded him with banana milkshakes through metal straws. At this stage, the brain-computer device records which neurons are activated, models the relationship between Pug&#39;s neural activity and the expected direction of movement, and achieves &quot;brain-computer connection.&quot; Judging from the macaque&#39;s brain thoughts controlling the joystick to play games, the implanted chip shows the preliminary goal of monkey-computer integration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After these results were obtained, Neuralink applied for human trials. Moreover, current human trials also follow the principle that they are only conducted on patients, not healthy subjects. For patients, trials are about balancing benefits and harms. Experiments on patients are to treat their diseases. Even if the process is full of risks, compared with the benefits of giving patients a new life, if the latter is greater or far greater than the former, it is feasible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This trial is targeting paralyzed patients and visually impaired people. Through the brain-computer interface, the brain consciousness of paralyzed patients can be obtained, and this consciousness can be received through an external computer, and then the computer can decipher and issue instructions to the corresponding mechanical devices to help patients with cerebral palsy move, at least to take care of themselves. Such as eating, drinking and going to the bathroom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the visually impaired, implanted visual chips can help them improve and restore their vision, such as helping patients with retinal dystrophy improve their vision. If successful, it could help more patients. There are currently about 1.3 million blind people and 2.9 million people with low vision in the United States. These two numbers are likely to grow to 2.2 million and 5 million by 2030. If the brain-computer interface can treat visual impairment, this group will also benefit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, if an accident occurs in a brain-computer interface experiment or if the damage exceeds the benefits, the principle of putting life and health first will need to be stopped immediately. However, such experiments may also yield unexpected results and new discoveries, helping to reveal more secrets of the human brain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, research on brain-computer interfaces in animals has achieved more results. A research team from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in the United States has developed a new system that combines virtual reality (VR) and brain-computer interface (BMI) to try to detect the thoughts or thoughts in the minds of rats. As in humans, when rodents experience places and events, the hippocampus, an area of ​​the brain responsible for spatial memory, activates specific patterns of neural activity that allow thoughts to wander back in time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The hippocampus is an important area of ​​the brain responsible for memory and imagination. It possesses a model of the environment called a cognitive map. Therefore, the hippocampus contains a spatial map-like representation of the previously explored environment. to facilitate subsequent recall or simulation. At the same time, the representation of each environment consists of specific place cells, and when the animal passes a specific location in that environment, these neurons fire selectively, recalling past scenes. This situation is similar to people&#39;s memory of the environment and cognition of environmental patterns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the test, the rats were placed in a specially designed VR system. The brain-computer interface system translated the rat&#39;s brain activity into movement on a virtual reality screen. Rats need to control their hippocampus activity to imagine specific scenes in order to receive rewards, and this thinking process is very similar to humans. When people are asked to go to a certain theater, they may imagine leaving home and going to the theater. Routes and neighborhoods that will be traveled. Afterwards, the rats were asked to move the virtual object from one location to another by imagining it, that is, the rats needed to move the object to the target location in the virtual space by controlling their hippocampus activity. The researchers then changed the location of the target, inducing the rats to produce activity patterns associated with the new location. The process is like the person sitting in the seat imagining picking up the cup next to the water dispenser and filling it with water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The results show that rats can control their hippocampal activity with the precision and flexibility of humans, holding their thoughts in a given position for several seconds, similar to how humans relive past events. event or imagine a new scenario. Moreover, as brain-computer interface systems are increasingly used in prosthetics, the results of this research can be used to design new prosthetic devices to serve people with disabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This study on rats once again shows that brain-computer interfaces can know a person&#39;s thoughts and thoughts, just like mind reading. This also means that future brain-computer interfaces can be used for in-depth research on human brain consciousness and thinking, but if they are to be used for healthy people and other purposes, more and stricter ethical and legal supervision is required. Therefore, it is easier to gain consensus by limiting human-machine interfaces to the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 17 Nov 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[在上海住了18年，这位来自迈阿密的“洋盘”还没打算离开]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260759]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-17 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/16/utyNcEWO8MEI850PChVe8Y1LL53sWqYf3c0BPhHY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;607&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/utyNcEWO8MEI850PChVe8Y1LL53sWqY f3c0BPhHY. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258507&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the respondent/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He pointed to a residential building across the street and told the story of his friend who had moved to Singapore; in the next street, the locksmith Master Ji saved him; and further on was He often goes to the small shop where clothes are repaired, and greets him every time he passes by. “If I don’t see them, I might forget them.” He is afraid of losing these living records. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Combining the life experience of his great-great-grandfather provided him with a new perspective, &quot;Our difficulties are simply incommensurable.&quot; Different from the missionary mission of his ancestors more than a hundred years ago, he has a new perspective on his own mission.

He said the origin of the name was somewhat boring. When he was working in a hotel in Shanghai more than ten years ago, a colleague in the human resources department named him Shen Jiawei, which he rarely used. When his new book &quot;Yangpan&quot; was published in October 2023, he changed the middle character to &quot;kai&quot;, which happened to have a similar pronunciation to his English name Christopher St. Cavish. Friends who know him well tend to call him Chris. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Foreign Deal&quot; records Chris&#39;s life in Shanghai over the past 18 years, including the whole story of his coming to Shanghai by chance, his ups and downs of riding a motorcycle around northwest China, and his unusual Family stories told to others.

Earlier, he applied a quantitative framework to the Xiao Long Bao in Shanghai, collecting the weight of the Xiao Long Bao, the weight of the soup, the quality of the fillings, and the thickness of the skin, calculating the structural and technological quality of the Xiao Long Bao, and wrote &quot;Shanghai Xiao Long Bao Index&quot;, &quot;if that counts as a book.&quot; Before writing, he worked as a professional chef in Miami and New York for 10 years. Tired of the static life in his hometown of Miami, he decided to seek opportunities in Asia and then travel around the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The initial destination I wanted was Hong Kong. At the beginning of the 21st century, he traveled through Southeast Asia as a backpacker and went to Hong Kong to visit his sister. He loves Hong Kong very much. &quot;It is neither a completely Western culture nor a completely Chinese culture.&quot; In the plan, he would go directly to the kitchen of the Peninsula Hotel and offer to work for free. But The Peninsula doesn’t need a young American who doesn’t speak Cantonese in its kitchen. After repeatedly hitting the wall and going through different referrals, he finally found a job as a chef in Shanghai. That’s how I came to Shanghai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2005, Chris came to Shanghai for the first time at the age of 24, planning to stay for only one year. What he didn&#39;t expect was that he would still be living here 18 years later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After working in Shanghai for a year, he quit his job as a chef and traveled around the northwest on a modified motorcycle. The journey is thrilling. The motorcycle was always breaking down and he was always looking for a repair shop along the way. One time the brake pads broke, but no shop had vintage brake parts made in Germany during the war (yes, in the 1930s). He later rode a motorcycle with broken brakes through Tianshui, Gansu Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Without any danger, he ended his month-long trip. &quot;I was still in Lanzhou in the morning, and arrived in Xining in the afternoon. Everything went too fast. I am used to life on a motorcycle. If I do it again, I might go to Xinjiang. It may not be safe, but...&quot; In short, he later sat down After a 36-hour train ride back to Shanghai, he flew back to Miami the next day. “At that time, I was not sure whether I wanted to come back, so I rented out the house.” Three months later, he returned to Shanghai. Just one more year, he thought. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many foreigners in China think so too. Wandering and living with the mentality of “just one more year”, only thinking about 12 months at a time. When my passport was filled with visa papers issued once a year, I suddenly realized that I had been living in this country for more than ten years. Chris calls this &quot;tomorrow syndrome&quot; - &quot;Tomorrow never comes. That year will never end.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Chris first came to Shanghai in 2005, there were 100,000 foreign residents in Shanghai. Ten years later, that number had doubled, and has decreased in recent years. &quot;Immigration and foreigners will automatically create their own bubble circle - a barbaric one-size-fits-all approach based on the wealth and poverty of your home country. See foreign doctors when you are sick, and spend a lot of money on imported ingredients when cooking.&quot; Although he is very fond of bubbles. The circle ridicules you in every possible way, but in fact you are also a member of the circle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/hzcXUoCTYzN6J3xgbfOiIuiREbwP3lMCzHTylElr.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1702&quot; height= &quot;1276&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/hzcXUoCTYzN6J3xgbfOiIuiREbwP3lMCzHTylElr.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258512&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 2023, Chris was filming the story of a famous hairy crab dumpling restaurant in Shanghai. This hotel will close in the spring of 2023 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Sheila Zhao/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most common greeting in the bubble circle is: Are you coming to China? How long? Can you speak Chinese? People judge who is the boss in this circle based on the answers. “A foreigner who has lived in China for six years will look down on a foreigner who has lived in China for six months, and by analogy, a foreigner who has lived in China for six months will look down on a foreigner who has lived in China for six weeks. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Comparisons like these apply to work, too, with expats teaching English at the bottom of that hierarchical chain of contempt and businessmen at the top. Chris knows several of the latter, &quot;They complain endlessly about the aunties, the Western food, and their Chinese employees.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They also complain about the changes. Expats who have been here for a long time often lament how beautiful Shanghai was in the past, but the implication is that it is not as good as it used to be. Chris doesn’t think so. “Shanghai teaches people to accept changes. This can be good or bad. If you find a good restaurant, you should go there today, because it may not be open tomorrow. If you don’t like Shanghai now, it doesn’t matter. Just wait. , it will be completely different in a year.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After staying in the bubble circle for too long, Chris sometimes wants to go out. The Shanghai Xiaolongbao evaluation completed in collaboration with friends is an attempt. After that, he was often in a half-and-half situation—“one foot in the bubble, one foot outside.” “It was like my identity. Sometimes I wake up in the morning and just want to be in the bubble, so I eat sandwiches for breakfast, pizza for dinner, and stay in my room watching YouTube all day. Sometimes I want to go out and chat with my neighbors and friends. I want to really live in Shanghai.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/Zaske81bGCt7il1Z5Du763IZ2PcIn6N6uv8kGAIS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;540&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src =&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/Zaske81bGCt7il1Z5Du763IZ2PcIn6N6uv8kGAIS.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258511&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text- align: center;&quot;>;In 2016, Chris learned the ramen making process at a ramen school in Lanzhou. This experience was also recorded in &quot;Foreign Dishes&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Writing in a Foreign Country&lt;/span>; strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After quitting being a chef, Chris switched jobs to work for an English magazine, writing food reports for foreigners in China. It took him several years to switch perspectives from chef to food writer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;What you want as a diner is completely different from what you want as a chef.&quot; At the end of October 2023, we made an appointment to meet in a Western restaurant. Chris gave the example of cinnamon rolls on the table, &quot; As a chef, I don&#39;t want them (walnuts and icing) to spill, and the edges to be neatly folded. But that doesn&#39;t affect the taste. As a diner, what I think about is does it taste good? Did I enjoy the meal? It Is the price right?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, food is just a medium for him to care about people, helping him to answer more curious questions: &quot;What is their life like? In what ways are we the same and in what ways are we different? ? What is their happiness? What about their sadness?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Writing seems to give me a license to ask people questions that would be excessive or embarrassing in normal interactions.&quot; Some The interview went deeper. For example, when he chatted with Master Tao, a handmade pottery maker in Hongkou, the other party naturally revealed to him the difficulties and struggles in the past. Others are not so lucky. For example, he started visiting the Cen brothers, who were both potters with Master Tao, in 2006. More than ten years later, they still &quot;never said hello&quot; as if they didn&#39;t know him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2015, Chris and his friends released the &quot;Shanghai Xiao Long Bao Index&quot;. They abandoned personal subjective opinions and measured hundreds of Xiao Long Bao in 52 stores from a purely physical perspective. &quot; Writing about food is bound to be subjective, and you have to understand what other people are obsessed with, but everyone insists on their own opinions (including myself), which makes me feel very tired. I want to change it, and let others or other Use things to make judgments.&quot; He confided in &quot;Foreign Dishes&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/63YOykirN9t6Q71aphczyDPfvNrfx43WSxM7Djga.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/63YOykirN9t6Q71aphczyDPfvNrfx43WSxM7Djga.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258509&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 2012, Chris was DJing in a nightclub&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;The &quot;Shanghai Xiao Long Bao Index&quot; unexpectedly gained him a lot of attention. He has been dubbed a &quot;foreigner obsessed with Xiao Long Bao&quot; and appears in many people&#39;s circles of friends and in interviews with the media. A company that specializes in making xiao long bao even invited him to be a consultant for cheese xiao long bao. He refused. The person in charge of the Shanghai Catering Association said in an interview that they would support Chris if he conducts follow-up research. After seeing the news, he walked to the bathroom and cried in the hallway. In his 10th year in Shanghai, he felt accepted by the city for the first time. Although when he later called the Shanghai Catering Association to talk, the other party had completely forgotten about it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After &quot;Shanghai Xiao Long Bao Index&quot;, Chris realized that his writing should have more interaction with China. &quot;This is the first step to get out of the bubble circle.&quot; In his circle of friends Gradually more and more Chinese people appeared. Xu Junqian met Chris after the release of &quot;Shanghai Xiao Long Bao Index&quot;. At that time, the latter was recruiting a researcher, and she sent an email to recommend herself. However, the two were slow to warm up, and they only met the following year after exchanging emails. As a test, Chris gave her a name and asked her if she could contact him. Later, the two set off smoothly and went to Yunnan to interview a chef. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because of her cooperation with Chris, Xu Junqian went to Altay to interview people who make camel milk, and also went to Shanxi to interview people who make pasta. If it weren&#39;t for work, she probably wouldn&#39;t have taken the initiative to set foot in these places. &quot;Chris speaks Chinese very well, but some dialects are still a bit difficult for him.&quot; When the two collaborate, Xu Junqian is often the interviewer, while Chris listens silently and only adds questions at the end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through Chris’s perspective, Xu Junqian has seen a lot, and “his skin has become thicker.” In her eyes, Chris is a pure person who “does not pursue eye-catching content or deliberately sensationalize. .&quot; In the spring and summer of 2023, they and the photographer went to Qinghai to interview Han Lu, an old man who makes Lanzhou Ramen. The old man cried when the conversation got emotional. This moment was also recorded by their camera, but Chris later did not use this part of the material. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/Cr1eWUzQ0tv0kOeBkhoA4MDssuwQmxxlGdt62phU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/Cr1eWUzQ0tv0kOeBkhoA4MDssuwQmxxlGdt62phU.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258508&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to her part-time job, Xu Junqian works in a family Work for foreign companies. She likes to compare the two jobs, &quot;They are like the two poles of the spectrum. Foreign-funded companies pursue returns when doing things, and they would like to arrange ABCD solutions for everything. But often, the more cautious they are, the less they dare to be creative.&quot; As for Chris, &quot;He keeps an open mind and always has unexpected gains.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past ten years or so, Chris has worked for several media outlets and experienced marriage, divorce, moving, and depression again. . After resigning from an online media in 2020, he opened a consulting company to provide services for hotels and restaurants. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the company&#39;s business is in a mess. &quot;It performed pretty well in 2021, but it was completely dead last year.&quot; The survival problems that writers often face are increasingly bothering him. The trip to Qinghai with Xu Junqian was paid for with his credit card and he paid it back recently. So he would &quot;take some editorial jobs, or do odd jobs for some schools. I had no choice.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He also thought about moving away from Shanghai to Suzhou or Dali, but neither was feasible. On the one hand, he cannot do without Shanghai&#39;s convenient medical system to prevent depression from recurring. On the other hand, &quot;I have many memories here.&quot; He pointed to a residential building across the street and told the story of his friend who had moved to Singapore; in the next street, the locksmith Master Ji saved him; and further on, He often goes to the small shop where clothes are repaired, and greets him every time he passes by. “If I don’t see them, I might forget them.” He is afraid of losing these living records. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The other dilemma is more secret, which was told to me by Xu Junqian. In the past two years, when she helped Chris find interviewees, she would always conceal the latter&#39;s nationality and only introduce him as a foreign author who writes about food. During the same trip to Qinghai, they also interviewed another Lanzhou ramen practitioner. The other person’s attitude was neither salty nor bland. He only asked the waiter to serve a few bowls of ramen. “It felt like he wanted us to leave as soon as we finished the noodles.” .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Are people less friendly?&quot; Chris also asked himself. &quot;I don&#39;t think so. Even if they hate the United States, at least they are polite to me. If you go to the United States in the past two years, the situation may be worse, and the hatred against Asians has become more and more intense.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src =&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/fI19RQMpK82UXKtvYnQsUBZlaQujmJNTCJQrW0ML.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/fI19RQMpK82UXKtvYnQsUBZlaQujmJNTCJQrW0ML.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258510&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center; &quot;>;The second time I met Chris, we walked together in a neighborhood he was familiar with. He once lived in an apartment on Huashan Road for four or five years, and he knew almost everything about the changes in the nearby shops&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Jiawei/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 >;&lt;strong>;Should I stay? Do I want to leave? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2006, when his parents and sister traveled to China, Chris heard the family story for the first time:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In 1867, 24-year-old Hiram Harrison Lowry and his wife left New York after graduating from Christian School and were sent to Fuzhou, China as a missionary. Two years later, they were ordered to Beijing to establish the first Methodist mission in North China. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Lori has been in China for more than fifty years and has experienced war, disease, intense xenophobia, the collapse of the Qing government, and personal life difficulties. They could have returned to the United States, but they chose to stay. They built schools, churches and hospitals for the poor Chinese at that time, and also served as deans of Huiwen Academy (after a complex evolution, this academy was incorporated into Yenching University and then into the famous Peking University today). &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The remains of my ancestors are buried somewhere in Beijing, to the west of the old city wall . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;——&quot;Foreign Dishes&quot;&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he first heard about his great-great-grandfather’s mysterious connection with China, Chris felt it was strange. When the family was walking in the alley near Tiananmen Square looking for the Asili Church (a legacy left by my great-great-grandfather, now the Christian Church Chongwenmen Church), Chris&#39;s mother started counting in broken Chinese. Chris and his sister were stunned, &quot;Can mom speak Chinese?&quot; He vaguely knew that his grandfather, who spoke fluent Mandarin, &quot;had a weird connection with China.&quot; However, his grandfather had a cold relationship with his family and believed in the philosophy of American men in the 1950s. He believes that women should take care of children and never talks too much about themselves with their children. When Chris&#39; mother was 21, her grandfather committed suicide. The clues are interrupted. Later, Chris asked other relatives in the family. They tried to contact Asili Tang, &quot;Maybe it was the language barrier, but they gave up in the end.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This matter was put on hold for 16 years. Until the spring of 2022, Chris was determined to salvage this piece of history. He saw it as some kind of family duty. The process of collecting information was like a detective challenge. Many diaries were lost or damaged. He spent a lot of energy - &quot;often working 12 hours a day&quot; - to track down Lowry&#39;s life. Finally, in &quot;Foreign Deal&quot;, he used two chapters to reconstruct the life experience of the Lowry couple more than a hundred years ago through detailed historical materials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/KIafELmP4N0SEMAmRv2A4MlyOWW8ecTYemMV5WlV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1059&quot; height= &quot;1500&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/KIafELmP4N0SEMAmRv2A4MlyOWW8ecTYemMV5WlV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258514&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Foreign Dishes - Three-dimensional Cover&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After writing &quot;Foreign Dishes&quot;, he couldn&#39;t stop I kept asking myself, &quot;Do I stay? Do I leave?&quot; There was no answer. In fact, he asks this question every year, when he goes to renew his visa at the turn of the new and old years of the lunar calendar. The long Spring Festival holiday is often wasted in anxiety. He is worried that &quot;the visa officer feels that he has paid too little tax due to his responsibilities, or that he dislikes the company&#39;s office being too small.&quot; The anxiety is getting worse every year, and he wants to keep his home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the COVID-19 epidemic, many of Chris’s friends have left China in recent years. Visas are becoming more and more difficult to obtain, and the number of flights back to China is not the same. He feels that now is the lowest number of foreigners in China in recent years. “The ones who remain are people who take China more seriously. They may have already Get married and have children here, or run a company.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This past summer, he did not have a good time. Depression and the bleak financial situation tortured him physically and mentally, so he borrowed money to return to Miami. After returning to his hometown after four years, he is no longer familiar with many things, such as how much tip should be given, and there are also some issues that he does not understand well and the context behind them, such as transgender. He was embarrassed to find that flying to Qinghai to interview an old man who makes Lanzhou Ramen was more attractive and comfortable than driving 10 minutes to a Colombian restaurant near his home to interview locals. &quot;In Qinghai, people assume that you are an outsider.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;He felt that he should stay in China. Sorting out the life experience of his great-great-grandfather provided him with a new perspective, &quot;Our difficulties are simply incommensurable.&quot; Different from the missionary mission of his ancestors more than a hundred years ago, he became increasingly clear about his mission, &quot;Here There is a lot of valuable knowledge, and I hope it can be seen by more people in the world. I have a visa, can travel, understand the different wisdom of Eastern and Western cultures, and I can do something.&quot; He is currently planning a video account, and is also Prepare a book about noodles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Back in 2006. After returning to Miami after a motorcycle trip around the northwest, Chris thought to himself, &quot;One year is not enough for China.&quot; More than ten years later, he said with a smile, &quot;Now I feel that 18 years is not enough.&quot; It’s not enough, I don’t know how to calculate enough.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 17 Nov 2023 09:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[3D真实还原早产儿出生后的六重难关丨国际早产儿日]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260775]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-17 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 17 Nov 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[永聚煤业火灾遇难26人：事发早晚交班时，起火二楼存大量工作服]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260782]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-16 23:50:08&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Post-disaster situation of Yongju Coal Industry Joint Construction Building.

CCTV+ Visual China Map&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At 6:51 on November 16, 2023, a fire broke out in the ground joint building of Yongju Coal Industry Co., Ltd. in Lishi District, Luliang City, Shanxi Province, killing 26 people and injuring 38 others. The patient is being treated with all his strength. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Information Office of the Luliang Municipal People’s Government, the fire broke out in the employee bathhouse of the Lianjian Building. Luliang City’s fire protection, public security, health, emergency and other departments rushed to the scene for rescue. The open flames were extinguished at about 8:35, and the rescue was completed at 13:45. The cause of the fire is under investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relevant staff of the Comprehensive Guidance Section of the Luliang City Fire Rescue Detachment told Southern Weekend reporters that the detachment immediately dispatched the police after receiving the call from passers-by. The fire occurred in a building on a local mine, but the specific purpose was unclear. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to official information, a total of 18 fire trucks, more than 30 ambulances, more than 90 medical staff, and more than 150 rescue workers were deployed at the scene for emergency rescue. Relevant staff from Luliang First People&#39;s Hospital told Southern Weekend reporters that the hospital is doing its best to treat the injured. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Run away blindly”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Miner Yang Xu (pseudonym) felt scared after escaping from the fire. In an interview with a Southern Weekend reporter, Yang Xu said frankly: “I’m scared. I choked to death inside, it was on the fourth floor, and I didn’t dare to jump.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the incident occurred, he was holding a pre-shift meeting on the fourth floor of the joint building. If there hadn&#39;t been this fire, after the meeting, he would go to the second floor to change clothes in the well, and then go down to the well on the first floor. Another miner who also works at Yongju Coal Mining told Southern Weekend reporters that the company arranges &quot;three shifts&quot; for underground employees. The morning shift is from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m., and the middle shift is from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. pm, and the evening shift is from 10 pm to 6 pm the next day. The time when the fire broke out was the handover time between the night shift leaving the well and the morning shift entering the well. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the day of the fire, Yang Xu worked the morning shift. He had a meeting at 6:30 and went down to the mine around 7:00. &quot;(The pre-shift meeting) lasted until about 6:50. I heard someone outside shouting, &#39;Come out, it&#39;s on fire.&#39; I was sitting by the window and saw it. Forty or fifty people in our team ran down the stairs. The fire was too big and the smoke was too strong. I turned on the light on my mobile phone and couldn&#39;t see anything. I took the stairs every day and ran down blindly. When I got to the first floor, the front door was on fire and I couldn&#39;t walk. I opened the back door. Escape. I almost choked to death when I escaped. The black smoke from (burning) plastic.&quot; Yang Xu recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Xu is 34 years old and started digging coal at the age of 18. He is a local in Luliang and his home is only more than ten minutes away from Yongju Coal Industry. After escaping from the fire scene, Yang Xu took a video of the scene. In the video, before daybreak, bright flames burst out from two windows on the second floor. Along with the sound of explosions, thick black smoke shot straight up along the outer wall. In another video, miners wearing work clothes were seen holding on to the drainage pipe on the outer wall to escape. Some people on the third and fourth floors also lowered ropes to save themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Xu has worked at Yongju Coal for more than two years. He estimates that there are two to three thousand miners working in the coal mine, mostly in their 40s and 50s, some local and some from other places. When the shift changes around 7 a.m. every day, there are about six to seven hundred people in the building. Yang Xu said that the building where the fire broke out has four floors. The first floor leads directly to the bottom of the well and is also the lamp room, which is a place where lights are placed and charged from underground. The second floor is a place for bathing and changing clothes, and the third and fourth floors are where workers hold meetings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The brother-in-law of a local woman interviewed is also a miner at Yongju Coal Mining. He had just been transferred from the morning shift to the middle shift the day before the incident. &quot;Fortunately, it was staggered.&quot; The woman told Southern Weekend reporters that her brother-in-law said that the Lianjian Building usually functions as an office building. Except for safety education meetings and showers before starting work, underground workers will not stay in the Lianjian Building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The blackened area on the left exterior wall is the scene of the fire.

Yang Xu said that when going down the well, one has to wear work clothes, and when going up the well, one has to take a shower and change into his own clothes. &quot;On the second floor, there are about two to three thousand people&#39;s underground clothes. Many of them are cotton clothes. They are placed in hanging baskets. The hanging baskets have two layers, one for clean clothes and one for dirty clothes. Every worker has a hanging basket. Usually The hanging baskets are hung from the ceiling. When changing clothes, you swipe your card and the hanging basket will be lowered by the rope.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A hanging basket installation master who has been in the industry for decades told Southern Weekend reporters: &quot;Many coal mines, Large enterprises such as steel plants, cement plants, and power plants all install this kind of (bathroom hanging basket).
