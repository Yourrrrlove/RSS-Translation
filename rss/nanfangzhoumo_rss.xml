CCTV+ Visual China Map&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At 6:51 on November 16, 2023, a fire broke out in the ground joint building of Yongju Coal Industry Co., Ltd. in Lishi District, Luliang City, Shanxi Province, killing 26 people and injuring 38 others. The patient is being treated with all his strength. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Information Office of the Luliang Municipal People’s Government, the fire broke out in the employee bathhouse of the Lianjian Building. Luliang City’s fire protection, public security, health, emergency and other departments rushed to the scene for rescue. The open flames were extinguished at about 8:35, and the rescue was completed at 13:45. The cause of the fire is under investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relevant staff of the Comprehensive Guidance Section of the Luliang City Fire Rescue Detachment told Southern Weekend reporters that the detachment immediately dispatched the police after receiving the call from passers-by. The fire occurred in a building on a local mine, but the specific purpose was unclear. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to official information, a total of 18 fire trucks, more than 30 ambulances, more than 90 medical staff, and more than 150 rescue workers were deployed at the scene for emergency rescue. Relevant staff from Luliang First People&#39;s Hospital told Southern Weekend reporters that the hospital is doing its best to treat the injured. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Run away blindly”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Miner Yang Xu (pseudonym) felt scared after escaping from the fire. In an interview with a Southern Weekend reporter, Yang Xu said frankly: “I’m scared. I choked to death inside, it was on the fourth floor, and I didn’t dare to jump.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the incident occurred, he was holding a pre-shift meeting on the fourth floor of the joint building. If there hadn&#39;t been this fire, after the meeting, he would go to the second floor to change clothes in the well, and then go down to the well on the first floor. Another miner who also works at Yongju Coal Mining told Southern Weekend reporters that the company arranges &quot;three shifts&quot; for underground employees. The morning shift is from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m., and the middle shift is from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. pm, and the evening shift is from 10 pm to 6 pm the next day. The time when the fire broke out was the handover time between the night shift leaving the well and the morning shift entering the well. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the day of the fire, Yang Xu worked the morning shift. He had a meeting at 6:30 and went down to the mine around 7:00. &quot;(The pre-shift meeting) lasted until about 6:50. I heard someone outside shouting, &#39;Come out, it&#39;s on fire.&#39; I was sitting by the window and saw it. Forty or fifty people in our team ran down the stairs. The fire was too big and the smoke was too strong. I turned on the light on my mobile phone and couldn&#39;t see anything. I took the stairs every day and ran down blindly. When I got to the first floor, the front door was on fire and I couldn&#39;t walk. I opened the back door. Escape. I almost choked to death when I escaped. The black smoke from (burning) plastic.&quot; Yang Xu recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Xu is 34 years old and started digging coal at the age of 18. He is a local in Luliang and his home is only more than ten minutes away from Yongju Coal Industry. After escaping from the fire scene, Yang Xu took a video of the scene. In the video, before daybreak, bright flames burst out from two windows on the second floor. Along with the sound of explosions, thick black smoke shot straight up along the outer wall. In another video, miners wearing work clothes were seen holding on to the drainage pipe on the outer wall to escape. Some people on the third and fourth floors also lowered ropes to save themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Xu has worked at Yongju Coal for more than two years. He estimates that there are two to three thousand miners working in the coal mine, mostly in their 40s and 50s, some local and some from other places. When the shift changes around 7 a.m. every day, there are about six to seven hundred people in the building. Yang Xu said that the building where the fire broke out has four floors. The first floor leads directly to the bottom of the well and is also the lamp room, which is a place where lights are placed and charged from underground. The second floor is a place for bathing and changing clothes, and the third and fourth floors are where workers hold meetings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The brother-in-law of a local woman interviewed is also a miner at Yongju Coal Mining. He had just been transferred from the morning shift to the middle shift the day before the incident. &quot;Fortunately, it was staggered.&quot; The woman told Southern Weekend reporters that her brother-in-law said that the Lianjian Building usually functions as an office building. Except for safety education meetings and showers before starting work, underground workers will not stay in the Lianjian Building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The blackened area on the left exterior wall is the scene of the fire.

CCTV+ Visual China Map&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Those who had the accident were all on the morning shift before the start of the meeting”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to CCTV news, the fire started on the second floor. Yang Xu said that when going down the well, one has to wear work clothes, and when going up the well, one has to take a shower and change into his own clothes. &quot;On the second floor, there are about two to three thousand people&#39;s underground clothes. Many of them are cotton clothes. They are placed in hanging baskets. The hanging baskets have two layers, one for clean clothes and one for dirty clothes. Every worker has a hanging basket. Usually The hanging baskets are hung from the ceiling. When changing clothes, you swipe your card and the hanging basket will be lowered by the rope.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A hanging basket installation master who has been in the industry for decades told Southern Weekend reporters: &quot;Many coal mines, Large enterprises such as steel plants, cement plants, and power plants all install this kind of (bathroom hanging basket). Our manufacturer is also very puzzled about the accident in Shanxi.&quot; He explained that if the fire is caused by wiring problems, the lifting basket is used The best is nylon rope, which will burn automatically and the basket will fall down without burning into pieces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Our products have not caught fire yet. The wires we use are 2.5 square meters copper-core flame-retardant wires with a 30-watt motor. The wire joints are all soldered with solder. It is wrapped with flame-retardant waterproof tape. Our plastic hanging basket is also flame-retardant, that is, if you keep putting it on the fire, it will catch fire, and as soon as it is out of the fire, it will go out immediately.&quot; The hanging basket master analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Those who worked the night shift were fine this time. Those who had the accident were all those who worked the morning shift before starting their shift. They were all on the third and fourth floors. They couldn&#39;t get out when they wanted to.&quot; Yang Xu said, for He had seen all the 26 people killed underground. &quot;They were probably from one team or two teams. All the 40 or 50 people in our team escaped.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Xu said that each shift in the mine costs 200 yuan, or 6,000 yuan a month. Although it is not low in the local area, it is &quot;half-tired to death and risking one&#39;s life to make money.&quot; Yang Xu didn&#39;t know what to do next. The mine stopped working after the accident, and he still had two children at home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public information shows that Yongju Coal is a private enterprise affiliated to Luliang Dongtai Group, with an approved production capacity of 1.5 million tons per year and a total of 837 employees. The mine was approved to start construction on November 4, 2020, and the merger, reorganization and integration project passed completion acceptance on June 1, 2021. On October 12, 2021, the Shanxi Provincial Department of Emergency Management approved the mine as a Level 2 mine in the safety production standardized management system. The joint building where the fire broke out is a reinforced concrete frame structure building with a total construction area of ​​6,920 square meters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Qichacha’s information, 33.3% of the 78 judicial cases involved in the company were labor disputes. In 2022, it received two environmental penalties, including construction before approval and excessive sewage discharge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of November 16, the Lishi District Emergency Management Bureau of Luliang City, Shanxi Province revealed that currently, various mining enterprises in Lishi District have suspended production for rectification, and are conducting investigation and rectification of fire hazards throughout the district.

According to the Beijing News, many persons responsible for the fire accident have been arrested. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 17 Nov 2023 00:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[摸清观众口味，老IP也能回春]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260771]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-16 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;Every classic horror film series, away from Don&#39;t open a murderer who is terrifying, such as Freddy in the &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; series, Michael Myers in the &quot;Moonlight&quot; series, Leatherface in &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;, &quot; Hannibal in the &quot;Hannibal&quot; series, Pennywise in the &quot;Return of the Clown&quot; series. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These super villains are synonymous with &quot;horror&quot; and have brought countless nightmares to movie fans. At the same time, their existence also constitutes the core attraction of the movie. Just like the MacGuffin in the movie, it makes people uneasy and worried about when they will show up and what kind of killing they will cause after they show up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/3f399188e77f9505d96543dcd3a96ceb.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/3f399188e77f9505d96543dcd3a96ceb.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258563&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Step into the Thousand After the Jubilee Year, although horror films declined, a director named James Wan showed his talents and created a series of impressive horror images. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The place where his dream began was &quot;Saw&quot; released in 2004. The then unknown James Wan and his friend Leigh Whannell had a sudden idea and used a cost of 1.2 million US dollars and 18 days of shooting time to create the low-cost horror film &quot;Saw&quot;. After the film was released, it grossed US$103 million at the global box office, making James Wan famous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/43be6fc791d4d4bf8d8601b789acc251.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;770&quot; height= &quot;345&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/43be6fc791d4d4bf8d8601b789acc251.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258560&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first work A huge success, opening up a bright road for the future. For the next six years, the series continued to be output at the rate of one movie per year, allowing the audience to experience various imaginative torture and murder mechanisms. So far, the &quot;Saw&quot; series has grossed more than 1 billion U.S. dollars (approximately 7 billion yuan) at the global box office, and has been certified by Guinness as &quot;the most successful series of horror films in history.&quot; Its influence is evident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the 8th and 9th installments, which were restarted after several years, caused the entire series to fall into the abyss of collapse. Especially &quot;Chainsaw 9: Vortex&quot;, released in 2021, suffered a terrible reputation and became the worst in the series. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/5a261e8c8d8d72b0db440a2f03dddd75.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;770&quot; height= &quot;345&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/5a261e8c8d8d72b0db440a2f03dddd75.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258559&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just in Movie Fans People all regretted that the masterpiece was not guaranteed in the late season, and the producer Lionsgate Pictures changed its direction and released &quot;Saw 10&quot;. Unexpectedly, this adjustment had an immediate effect, making this IP burst out with vigorous vitality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It no longer simply shows blood and torture, but instead introduces the analysis of human nature from the perspective of the old murderer Jigsaw. European and American film critics unanimously believe that &quot;Saw 10&quot; is more like a movie than other films in the series. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/a5f4dfacd6b3d97ff5e192053afa52cb.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1350&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/a5f4dfacd6b3d97ff5e192053afa52cb.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258562&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Familiar with &quot;Electronic Audiences of the &quot;Saw&quot; series know that this series has two main characteristics: first, it always tells stories from the perspective of victims or police, throwing extreme dangers and moral dilemmas to the audience; second, it creates Jigsaw, the terrifying jigsaw killer, casts a huge shadow over his victims. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Saw 10&quot;, the perspective is changed, and the main perspective of the villain Jigsaw is used to advance the movie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/4630740adca06fc8b01df8a0777e8256.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;583&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/4630740adca06fc8b01df8a0777e8256.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258561&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jigsaw&#39;s real name John Kramer, although known as a perverted murderer, never kills anyone himself. Most of the time, he just acts as a judge. He is a terminally ill engineer who likes to tinker with various exquisite torture instruments to make victims choose between pain and death. In his view, this choice is &quot;not punishment, but redemption&quot;, giving those guilty a chance to reform and allowing them to understand the value of life in pain. This kind of &quot;good intentions&quot; constitutes the fatal and terrifying attraction of this character. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jigsaw only lived for three episodes in this series and died at the end of &quot;Saw 3&quot;. Next, he &quot;lived&quot; for five more episodes through memories, videos, etc. His followers inherited his will and continued to set challenges for others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/8bcc0ec65647f883c8df9c7fe6434c8a.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/8bcc0ec65647f883c8df9c7fe6434c8a.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258564&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Caught Jigsaw is a character who captures the soul of the series. Due to Jigsaw&#39;s absence from &quot;Saw 9&quot;, the film&#39;s reputation immediately collapsed. Audiences generally believed that without Jigsaw&#39;s iconic voice and thought-provoking lines, the series seemed to have been hollowed out and lost its creepy feel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, the filmmakers cleverly made &quot;Saw 10&quot; a prequel, with the timeline set between the first and second parts, so that Jigsaw is still alive. At that time, Jigsaw was suffering from cancer. By chance, he learned from his patients that there was an underground medical organization in Mexico that could effectively cure cancer. After getting a rough understanding of the organization, Jigsaw headed to Mexico alone with his last glimmer of hope. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/ad85b2d10fce5915bcc1d7952ea9d6ab.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;584&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/ad85b2d10fce5915bcc1d7952ea9d6ab.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258566&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In With the help of doctor Cecilia, Jigsaw underwent what is called an &quot;awake craniotomy.&quot; After the operation, the doctor told him that everything was going well and he should rest and recuperate. A few days later, when Jigsaw returned to the agency and wanted to express his gratitude, he found that the place was empty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The craniotomy video he saw during the operation was just a teaching video recorded in advance. It turned out that what he encountered was a fraud group that specializes in scamming cancer patients: the hospital was fake, the doctor was fake, the surgery was fake, and his disease was not cured at all. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/f4d7a40ca514959917e38f18dfb5e61e.gif&quot; border=&quot;0 &quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;339&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/f4d7a40ca514959917e38f18dfb5e61e.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;258568&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;In order to take revenge and punish this fraud group, Jigsaw started another round of killings. He arrested all members of the fraud chain, from drivers to nurses, anesthetists, and doctors. Along with them came the familiar jigsaw torture: scraping bones and flesh to defuse bombs, breaking legs to extract bone marrow, opening skulls to remove brain tissue...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to these bloody tortures, &quot;Saw 10&quot; &quot;The most outstanding contribution is that it fleshes out the character of Jigsaw to the greatest extent, magnifies his weakness, and makes him look more like a &quot;person&quot; - a terminally ill old man who seeks medical treatment urgently, and this Old people will also cry for the rest of their lives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this kind of fullness also has its regrets, that is, it can easily make the character &quot;intellectual&quot;. Jigsaw has always been a mysterious, cruel and highly intelligent villain, and he is a symbol of evil. The &quot;in-depth interpretation&quot; of &quot;Saw 10&quot; undermined the coldness and mastery of his symbolic period. People can&#39;t help but wonder, such a clumsy fraud technique can actually deceive the famous Jigsaw? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/e962fca1bdb9a682032b0406e409ffe0.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;584&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/e962fca1bdb9a682032b0406e409ffe0.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258567&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, from Jigsaw&#39;s perspective cut also greatly weakened the film&#39;s reversal and suspense. Although Jigsaw sets up a reverse climax in the film by taking personal risks in order to find out the mastermind behind the scenes, it pales in comparison to the ultimate reversal in the &quot;Saw&quot; series. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, the series was approached from the perspective of the victim and the police, and the setting of suspense points was often very layered: the first level was the victim’s level-breaking mode, either solo, or cooperatively, or in trials. The process is full of all kinds of uncertainties; the second level is the detective&#39;s perseverance in the case and the battle of wits and courage with Jigsaw and his followers. The audience can&#39;t help but sweat for the detective and wonder what he can do. Can they successfully arrest the murderer and save their lives? &quot;Chainsaw 10&quot; only retains the first layer of suspense and completely abandons the second layer of suspense, greatly reducing its suspense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/b8fd0f4e9f37091626ad3cb526d3cc9b.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;581&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/b8fd0f4e9f37091626ad3cb526d3cc9b.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258565&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, in order Catering to the trend of anti-elitism in Hollywood, &quot;Saw 10&quot; also increased the &quot;heroic temperament&quot; of Jigsaw. Because Jigsaw faces a female doctor who is only interested in profit and disregards human life, the film emphasizes the justice of his lynching more than any previous film. He has transformed from a morally ambiguous villain into a civilian hero who stands up for patients. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, in a sense, the revival of &quot;Saw 10&quot; is speculative and clever, and it is also the vane of current Hollywood sequels: as long as we hold on to the soul of the story, grasp the trend of the times, and feel By clarifying the audience&#39;s taste, old IP can find a new outlet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 16 Nov 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[缅北果敢电信网络诈骗犯罪集团首犯明学昌畏罪自杀]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260780]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-16 23:07:47&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On November 12, the public security organs in Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province arrested Mingxue, an important leader of the Kokang Telecom Internet Fraud Criminal Group in northern Myanmar, in accordance with the law.

Some people think too highly of old-style poetry, while others take old-style poetry too lightly. Let’s talk about the former first. Old-style poetry is indeed the jewel in the crown of Chinese literature, but that is only in terms of its excellent works, not that its technology is difficult to master. Li Bai and Du Fu wrote in the old style, and I also wrote in the old style. This can only mean that we use the same style. I have a friend who went to the same elementary school as Yao Ming, but he never thought of himself as Yao Ming - I think this is common sense. Unfortunately, in the world of poetry, not everyone has this common sense. Some people regard being able to write old-style poems as a status symbol. They hold some basic rules as a secret that is not passed down. They say it horizontally and vertically and are proud of it all their lives. It always reminds me of using the tires of the crashed plane as a sacred offering. Aborigines who rose up. In fact, as a skill, the threshold for old-style poetry is not high, and basic rules such as equivalence and antithesis can be mastered in two days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Focus on the latter. I have seen many professors who study classical literature who like to write old-style poetry and are quite proud of their ability to write poetry. However, after reading the works of most of them, one feels deeply regretful. where is the problem? Although many people now accuse the academic community of being low-level, it is fair to say that these professors are not bad at learning. They have studied a large amount of literature, written many good papers, and are familiar with the techniques of classical literature. Some of them are even very good at writing. I remember one of them. His academic prose was brilliant and full of wonderful ideas, which made me unable to stop reading until he showed off his limericks in a serious and triumphant manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason for this situation is probably aesthetic. Aesthetics is &quot;tacit&quot; and cannot be accumulated with knowledge. As far as poetry is concerned, the only way to cultivate aesthetics is to see the best works and experience the beauty in them - to use an outdated buzzword, it is to &quot;open the taste buds&quot; . Having aesthetic ability does not necessarily mean that you can write good poetry - art always requires talent - but at least it can make people aware of themselves. For them, if the poem is poor, it will not be published, and the works that can be shown to others are naturally above the standard. In recent years, I have seen some comments that overestimate old-style literature and believe that the study of classical literature in the modern academic system is meaningless. Only those who can write poetry and classical prose are valuable. I think this is a biased view. A qualified essay requires no less skill and effort than writing a qualified poem. In my opinion, the former is also more valuable. So I often feel sorry for the professors mentioned above - they can obviously write such good papers and monographs, but they can&#39;t write a qualified poem, just like the Mayans in the American jungle who can create magnificent Pyramid, revised amazing calendar, but cannot make the most basic wheel. This is a problem of the shortboard being too short, not a problem of the longboard not being long enough. But some people misunderstand the crux of the matter. Recently, I have also seen some erudite people diligently searching for literature, trying to find a way to write poetry by solving problems such as &quot;How does Qian Zhongshu read poetry&quot;, but the results are often disappointing. In my opinion, they are trying to lengthen the strengths of the literature while ignoring the shortcomings of aesthetics. They are primary school students pretending to be doctoral students to talk about advanced issues, regardless of the fact that the 1+1 foundation is not well laid. For them, it is more urgent to read &quot;Three Hundred Tang Poems&quot; than to explore unpopular literature that sounds noble--if their purpose is to write good poems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Wang Yonghao&#39;s &quot;Chaoyunlou Poetry Notes&quot; provides an excellent example for contemporary people to write old-style poems. This collection of poems contains 1,402 poems, and I spent a week reading them. What impressed me most about this note was the author&#39;s excellent aesthetics, which may be related to the fact that he studied painting when he was young. Painting is an intuitive art, with a higher threshold than poetry and less room for ambiguity. The edification of painting itself is a good aesthetic training. I think Chaoyunlou&#39;s poems have three characteristics, which are especially worthy of reference by contemporary aspiring poets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, the elegance of words. The poems in Chaoyunlou all use elegant words, and there are absolutely no vulgar words. From the perspective of literary history, there is no absolute superiority or inferiority between elegance and vulgarity. There are many common sayings of the time in Du&#39;s poems. Zhang Jie of the Song Dynasty said in &quot;Suihantang Poetry Talk&quot;: &quot;The worldly disciples see how vulgar Zi&#39;s beautiful poems are, but they don&#39;t know that vulgar language is the most difficult in poetry. It is not vulgar, but the most ancient. Yes.&quot; This statement is too flattering. I think Mr. Zhou Yukai said it best: &quot;When these common sayings invade the elegant and exquisite poetic word system, they immediately bring a fresh stimulation in their non-poetic form. A little bit of it can cure the &quot;vulgarity&quot; that is full of statements in traditional poetry.&quot; It can be seen that vulgarity can cure the kind of &quot;vulgarity&quot; that is &quot;elegant but so vulgar&quot;. In modern times, Nie Gannu&#39;s poems are very popular, and he also &quot;takes vulgarity as elegance&quot;, and various common sayings make people laugh (famous lines such as &quot;It is easy to write nonsense words, but it is difficult to be honest in thoughts&quot;). But nowadays, people generally lack classical cultivation. &quot;Elegance&quot; is much rarer than &quot;vulgarity&quot;. Few people can write elegant and upright poetry and ancient prose. Moreover, using &quot;vulgar&quot; is more difficult than using &quot;elegant&quot;. &quot;Vulgar&quot; can only be valuable if it is as interesting as Nie Gannu. Once it is vulgar and boring, it tastes like cold French fries. From my reading experience, contemporary poetry writing suffers from &quot;vulgarity&quot;. A few years ago, a professor used a very vulgar dialect in a poem and triggered a wave of parody. This shows the value of Chao Yunlou&#39;s use of elegant words. . Let&#39;s take &quot;Italian Dolomites&quot; as an example:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;It is so magnificent that the flood is overthrown and the beginning is the beginning. The golden energy spreads across the horizon, and the surrounding area is covered with frost. The wind is blowing in the wilderness, and there is no starlight in the sky. He entered the room in the morning with his jade in his hand, and took his armor with him to shine on the bed at night. Watch the clouds fall and their shadows disperse, let the crane spend its time dreaming. Jiazhao can be met sincerely, but it is difficult to read all the books. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chaoyunlou uses the wild brushstrokes of poets from the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties to depict the magnificent autumn scenery of the Italian Dolomites, including &quot;flood over&quot;, &quot;juechu&quot;, &quot;opening&quot;, &quot;gazing&quot; and &quot;surrounding view&quot;. Words such as &quot;Jia Zhao&quot; and &quot;Chi Shu&quot; are full of ancient meanings, and &quot;holding jade into the room in the morning and wearing armor to look at the bed at night&quot; can especially be used to express an exotic situation like Chinese classical music, which is extremely elegant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is the richness of life. Chao Yunlou has traveled extensively throughout Europe and Asia, and has a deep understanding of humanities, art and natural landscapes. Chinese tradition values ​​a poet&#39;s experience. Su Dongpo criticized Meng Haoran&#39;s poems as &quot;like making a wine hand without materials&quot;, which means that although he has talent, he lacks experience. Shen Zengzhi believed that opening up a poetic realm was &quot;the ability of an explorer to find new worlds and open ports.&quot; Kang Youwei said in his poem that &quot;the new world is full of strange and wonderful places, and he also searched Europe and Asia to create new sounds.&quot; They both realized the &quot;new world&quot; and &quot;new poetry&quot;. &quot;environment&quot; relationship. Speaking of practitioners among modern people, the first thing that comes to mind is Mr. Jao Tsung-i&#39;s collections of &quot;Buddha Country&quot;, &quot;Western Sea&quot;, &quot;White Mountain&quot; and &quot;Black Lake&quot;, which record the mountains, rivers and customs he saw during his overseas travels. &quot;The self-expectation in the preface is to &quot;point the way forward for the poetry world and open up new eyes and ears to the world.&quot; I think the best one is &quot;Napoleon&#39;s Tomb&quot; in &quot;The Collection of the West Sea&quot;:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;A hundred battles come to an end If you betray him, he will stroke the bronze camel from under the palace. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The water in the deep palace pool is still sobbing, and the wind and smoke on the island are passing by. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The long days are tired and the short days are sad, and the monument stands abruptly opposite the river. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I have no regrets about the abundant return of my soul, and my last words really make me cry. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is tragic, generous and moving, making people sing and sigh. Rao Gong&#39;s nature is calm and peaceful, so it is rare to see such heartfelt works, which often leave people with the feeling that there is still something to be said. This regret was made up for after opening &quot;Chao Yunlou Poetry Notes&quot; - Chao Yunlou&#39;s poems have loud sounds and strong emotions, which is my favorite style. Let’s take “Reflections on the Parthenon on the Acropolis” as an example:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The wind and smoke outside the depression grass are passing by. There is a sacrificial field in Zhenwu. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Several carved pillars are damaged by singing, and one is hanging from the rafters facing the moon. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The Jade Hall was destroyed by fire and empty, and the lonely soul of the Golden Hall was stagnant. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Thousands of dendrobiums are leisurely and sorrowful day and night, and I look alone at Liuhe and place my wine cup on the string. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The materials used in the poem are all Chinese classical, but the imagery is exotic. As a reader with a global perspective, it is easy to appreciate the wonderful idea of ​​blending China and the West, such as &quot;several places of pressing songs to damage the carved pillars&quot;. &quot;Pressing songs&quot; is a Chinese classic, but when juxtaposed with &quot;carved pillars&quot;, it makes people think The harp in ancient Greece, and the &quot;column&quot; also refers to the famous marble columns of the Parthenon. It&#39;s a pun, and it&#39;s very ingenious. The last couplet implicitly uses Xie Tiao&#39;s &quot;The river flows day and night, and the guests&#39; hearts are still sad&quot;, which expresses the meaning of rejoicing in time, which is very similar to Li Bai&#39;s &quot;Wu song and Chu dance are not over yet, the green mountains want to hold half of the sun. Silver arrows and golden pots leak a lot of water, &quot;Looking at the autumn moon falling on the river waves&quot;, Du Fu &quot;I don&#39;t know where the royal palace is, but the ruins are under the cliff... The beauty is made of loess, but the condition is pink and white. At that time, I served on the golden carriage, and the old thing was a stone horse. When I came to borrow straw, I sat down and sang loudly with tears. During the journey, who is the elder?&quot; The vast sadness without the slightest frivolity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third is the sincerity of emotion. The poems in Chaoyunlou are all sincere and serious. Many people like to write poems in a glib or eccentric tone, or even be mean and mean, in order to show off their talents. Their targets were great talents like Su Dongpo and Qian Zhongshu. Little did they know that Su Dongpo&#39;s humor came from his broad-mindedness in adversity, while Qian Zhongshu&#39;s humor came from his insight into the world. Both of them had very noble personalities and were very kind to others. They were by no means less intelligent than those today. One&#39;s imitator. Chao Yunlou&#39;s poetry is the opposite of this vulgar poetry style. It is simple, majestic, and full of gentle and honest emotions of classic literature. Let&#39;s take &quot;Visiting the Old House in Montpellier to Compose a Long Song to an Old Friend&quot; as an example:&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Recalling the past, I saw the beauty across the flowers, and vowed to miss her dearly with my delicate hands. Occasionally, the sound in front of the lamp is lingering, but after saying goodbye, it is still difficult to hold on. Look at the bright moonlight like water, and look at the jagged shadows of the trees in the courtyard. I avoid people late at night and come to tell my secrets, and I go to share my secrets with the birds in the morning. There are many high-profile guests holding cups in the hall. Who is sitting there waving his bows and reciting poems? The timidity is dripping in the jade, and the courage to face the stubbornness is still a waste of words. Thinking of his long-lasting desolation at the end of the world, why is it so foolish to sing wildly in Yan City? There should be a high door that can hold the foot, but the rafters cannot be repaired. Gu Zi is frivolous and passes down the household, and his pearls and shoes reach the sunset. Fang Qing turned his back on the lamp and sighed that the night would last forever. Then he turned to face the wall and felt sad. The swallows circled the carvings and mistakenly painted the building, and the rain overflowed the eaves and damaged the old foundation. The old path is covered with stones and grass, and the moss and brocade are covered with snow in the cold dew. Because I feel that every morning the flute is noisy, and in the evening the shengpa is singing and the music is missing. There is no need to blame God for the depression, there is no deception in the mighty years. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scenery is beautiful and the heart is full of twists and turns. &quot;There is no need to blame fortune for the depression, there is no deception in the mighty years&quot;, which especially shows the clarity of the poet&#39;s heart. The structure of this long poem is reminiscent of the famous &quot;hanging poem&quot; by the ancient Arab poet Ummrull al-Qais. It is also inspired by the old residence, recalling the joy and love with old friends, looking back on the present and the past, and feeling deeply moved. It can be seen that poets from different civilizations have similarities in their poetic minds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After reading &quot;Chao Yunlou Poetry Notes&quot;, I have a strong impression: the author is a &quot;Renaissance man&quot;, versatile, with surging creative talent and desire. The author has a high reputation in the academic world, but he will never be complacent about it. Try reading &quot;The main church is the place where the Portuguese navigator Prince Henry was born and baptized. From its north-facing balcony, you can still see the scenery of the old city winding to the Douro Valley. Human affairs and metabolism have passed through the past and present, and humankind&#39;s ambitions and long-term aspirations have never been extinguished, and we cannot help but be vigilant, vigilant, and diligent to achieve love.&quot;:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;老I am afraid of being alone in the storm, and I cherish my broken body because of my wife. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I admire him for hanging on the mat and kissing the birds, and I have found the quiet place and cried on the journey. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;It is difficult to recruit Haijia easily when facing the water, and I regret my mistake in cursive writing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The body is often spared from returning to the fish belly, but the mind is trapped in the moon pot&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;Prince Henry (I used to call him &quot;Enrique&quot; to distinguish him from many mediocre people with the same name) was a great figure who created the Age of Discovery. Chao Yunlou looked at the old man from the balcony of the church where he was baptized. City, when I think of mankind&#39;s great ambitions, I can&#39;t help but feel vigilant and excited. Chao Yunlou prides himself on being a &quot;confucian scholar&quot; and admires Prince Henry&#39;s sailing career of &quot;hanging on the mat and flying birds in the air&quot;, which shows his ambition to reach thousands of miles. I think people today are not necessarily inferior to the ancients on one point - Enrique had never been to the open sea at that time, and in terms of extensive travels, Chaoyunlou has far surpassed Enrique. Enrique organized an expedition fleet and opened up a new route. &quot;Chaoyunlou Poetry Notes&quot; demonstrated a way for contemporary people to write old-style poems. As readers, we certainly hope that more poets will follow the route opened by Chaoyun Tower and reach the new world of poetry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 16 Nov 2023 22:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[260元转卖剩药被判“贩毒”，吃不完的药到底该怎么处置？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260757]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-16 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 16 Nov 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[女律师参加庭审后遭袭：降低律师职业风险有赖于公众形成正确认知丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260761]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-16 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On the afternoon of November 2, 2023, a video of a man hammering a woman on the street spread online. It shows that the incident took place near the Tongxiang Municipal Court in Jiaxing, Zhejiang. The local police issued a report stating that the criminal suspect Cao Moumou (male, 36 years old, Henan nationality) armed Lou Moumou and injured Lou Moumou due to a dispute. An internal report from the law firm stated that after lawyer Lou participated in a civil case trial at the Tongxiang Municipal Court on November 2, he was followed by the other party and attacked with a hammer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is almost no time lag when the incident occurred on the same day and the video was released on the same day. News narratives can naturally influence public perception. However, in the era of decentralization, it is difficult for one party to monopolize facts and narratives, and there is even a lack of intentionality. Unintentional rumors and even rumors creep in, so public perception may change depending on which narrative prevails. This incident is another typical case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Initially, with little other background information, what the public notices is the gender narrative. Of course, the public is still very interested in the nature of disputes and the content of civil cases. Some netizens immediately dug up: This is a real estate dispute case. Lawyer Lou is the agent of the real estate company and the man is the owner. Subsequently, it was also confirmed by media reports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on these facts, a popular rumor has appeared on the Internet: The man bought a unfinished building from a well-known developer and then sued to defend his rights. Lawyer Lou &quot;helped the tiger&quot; and won the lawsuit. , the man took the risk in anger, and some people even said with emotion, &quot;The lawyer&#39;s fees she received may be the house payment paid by the man.&quot; Based on this narrative, there are no small voices expressing sympathy for the man online. But in fact, the person who had the dispute with the man was a local real estate company called Orrick, not an online developer, which in itself weakens the credibility of the information. Of course, the truth requires further investigation, so no further speculation will be made here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We focus on the interaction between narrative and public perception. The lawyer who was attacked had multiple identity labels: female, white-collar worker, lawyer, agent of a real estate company; the perpetrator also had multiple identity labels: male, home buyer/owner, litigant... What identities did the two choose to tell the story? Can influence public perception. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, there is a problem with the gender narrative used by some of the earliest big Vs. If we talk about beating people, the correct value should be: no one should take the initiative to commit violence to cause physical harm to others, regardless of whether the perpetrator and victim are male, female or have other identity backgrounds. To judge the nature of an assault, one should start from the merits of the matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the subsequent narrative of &quot;a real estate company agent who works as a swindler vs. an owner/home buyer who is bullied and forced to a dead end&quot; captured many people. Under this narrative, many people sympathize with the owners/home buyers, and the underlying value is that the weak are justified. If the man bought an unfinished building, he would indeed receive more sympathy; if he just wanted to check out because of the falling housing prices but did not want to bear the cost, he would receive less sympathy. In either case, though, why would the man hammer a lawyer who was merely an attorney? In addition to venting your anger, it does not help solve the problem, but instead involves yourself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, the last unavoidable question is, what kind of correct understanding should the public have of the lawyer profession? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the female lawyer was attacked by the opposing client, there were two typical opinions in the lawyer circle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One is to talk about the professional risks faced by lawyers, express a sense of indignation and tragedy, and demand that the man be severely punished to serve as a warning to others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The other also acknowledges the existence of occupational risks, but emphasizes that individuals should effectively avoid them. For example, a lawyer said that when he first started practicing law, an old lawyer warned him: Don&#39;t deliberately anger the other party. This is strategic risk aversion. Some lawyers also said: Lawyers should still stand on the side of fairness and justice. Lawyers should not become slaves of &quot;money&quot; and &quot;power.&quot; Lawyers serve their clients, but they cannot become an accomplice. You can&#39;t be just for profit, this is to avoid risks through the choice of values. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind this is how to view the lawyer profession. I believe that there must be a considerable number of lawyers who engage in this profession just to pursue justice, protect rights and defend the rule of law. These spiritual pursuits transcend income considerations, but in addition to such idealists, there will also be practitioners who take a fancy to them. Lawyers have better income prospects and higher social status as a profession, and their talents and interests are also conducive to pursuing this profession. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this sense, for the vast majority of lawyers, it is the lawyer&#39;s work scope and professional ethics to be hired by the client to defend the client and strive for the best interests. The pursuit of factual truth and fairness and justice beyond the &quot;two creations&quot; (from &quot;Shu Jing Lu Xing&quot;, specifically referring to both parties in the dispute) are more of the primary consideration of judges rather than lawyers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this reason, lawyers use all their skills and skills inside and outside the court to try to get the judge to accept the narrative version they have constructed and the legal principles they cited, and to guide the judge to reject the other party’s arguments. The structure, narrative version and legal principles cited are used to allow the parties to win the case or minimize losses. Even in such a scenario, ambiguities in the law will be used to guide the judge to interpret it favorably for his client. These are common practices used by lawyers to help clients win cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scope of work and professional ethics of lawyers are to help clients win lawsuits. If the public elevates and highlights the profession of lawyers in other directions, it will undoubtedly form a wrong understanding and thus have a negative impression of lawyers in their hearts. Having moral requirements that go beyond the scope of work and professional ethics is actually putting lawyers on the fire. Therefore, the public should still have a correct understanding of the content of lawyers&#39; profession. This will dispel many people&#39;s unrealistic fantasies and requirements for lawyers and help reduce the professional risks faced by lawyers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 16 Nov 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[明学昌、明珍珍、明国平三名缅北电诈重要头目被缅甸警方逮捕]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260773]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-16 19:19:46&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;According to Myanmar Myawaddy TV, on November 16, due to the implementation of online fraud, kidnapping, For illegal detention, extortion and other criminal activities, three important leaders of a telecom fraud criminal group in northern Myanmar, Ming Xuechang, Ming Zhenzhen, and Ming Guoping, were captured by the Myanmar police in the Kokang Autonomous Region in northern Myanmar.

I have marked &quot;watched&quot; more than 1,800 movies on &quot;Douban&quot; Department, actually more than that. Seeing too much does not mean knowing too much. Greed will damage the aesthetic digestion function and make you afraid of topics such as &quot;favorite movie&quot; - when the word &quot;most&quot; comes out, all kinds of emotions are mixed. It seems that the emphasis on A and B means betrayal of Bing and Ding. Usually, I have something to say only through the constraints of themes and categories. Influenced by the war in distant places, I thought of some films involving the theme of &quot;hate&quot;, and I will briefly recommend them here, limited to three. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/jIuky9U1vKDmS808x28XPRDUfDVNwHuHFSC5SJ18.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;601&quot; height= &quot;841&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/jIuky9U1vKDmS808x28XPRDUfDVNwHuHFSC5SJ18.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258367&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>; &quot;Munich&quot; (&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;2005&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;)&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This is the second time Steven Spielberg has directed a Jewish film. Different from &quot;Schindler&#39;s List&quot;, which is about suffering and salvation, this film is based on the racial killings that took place in the Munich Olympic Village, focusing on the grievances and vendettas between ethnic groups. The subject matter is documentary, the mood is tragic, and the melodies of funeral songs are always lingering. , conveying the tragic atmosphere of never peace. The film refuses to end in a happy ending, which not only respects the facts but also conforms to morality: despair is unpleasant, but it is a truly serious emotion. Forcibly displaying greenery in a barren land is essentially nothingness and cowardice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The director used realistic techniques to reproduce the working methods of the five Jewish killers. Their deeds of eliminating their opponents one by one can easily be deified on the big screen, but the film restores their mundanity. They are not cold and capable professional killers. Their techniques are amateurish, they often make mistakes, and they are also mired in unextricable fear. Three of them died in the revenge of their rival &quot;Black September&quot;. Although the remaining two were lucky enough to survive, they were insulated from the quiet and peaceful years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They took over this dark job entrusted by the government, and their motivation was related to the national destiny and national humiliation. They have no personal grudges against their opponents. Every time they succeed, they will sharpen their opponent&#39;s will and make a tougher opponent sit in the dead man&#39;s position. Victory becomes an illusion and the result is nothing more than a pie in the sky. However, the living space of the two nations is too overlapping and squeezed, and the historical disputes are too entangled. Both sides are accustomed to sanctifying their own interests and despising or misinterpreting the other side&#39;s submissions. Hatred has become the core of justice, and revenge has become the norm. and faith. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end, the male protagonist, Mossad agent Avner, was on the verge of losing control mentally. He did not even dare to sleep on his own bed and huddled in the closet. The director probably wants to say: Hatred is not the solution. Using revenge to pursue justice will only banish peace; and peace is the heart of justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/beJdHoQckRKshl9OOoXZVL3sNGMZxfjlYqagkU9N.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;529&quot; height= &quot;748&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/beJdHoQckRKshl9OOoXZVL3sNGMZxfjlYqagkU9N.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258368&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>; &quot;Black Book&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Book&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&quot; (2&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;006&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;)&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;People are good at Rationalizing one&#39;s own hatred, the real traces of &quot;hate&quot; are much more hidden. This is the unexpected revelation of the Dutch movie &quot;Black Book&quot;. The film is also based on real people, and hatred serves as a booster for the plot, with a changing spectrum. The blood and blood of hatred seen by the audience are mostly the phantoms of demons caused by the selfish greed of individuals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The story of the heroine Rachel has the highest tear-jerking value. However, director Paul Verhoeven does not pursue a sense of documentary and solemnity. He has fast-changing rhythms and overly eye-catching scenes, and Rachel’s Her sweet looks and open demeanor all work together to prevent viewers from spiraling into grief. She originally deserved the best life, but because of her Jewish identity, she was suddenly buried under Hitler&#39;s genocide policy. All her family members died tragically. Matching bad luck. ——With another director, the film could easily be made into a tear collector. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The various hatreds present in Rachel&#39;s life have complex ingredients. She was supposed to join forces with her compatriots to avenge the sworn Nazis, but the result was extremely absurd: because the local Jews were relatively wealthy, and although Nazi military discipline supported anti-Semitism, it prohibited the SS from enriching their own pockets, poaching Jews became a problem for some locals. The Dutch made money by using the curtain provided by the Nazis to carry out sinister acts and plunder crazily. In the end, Rachel suffered major injuries, mainly from the deadly assassinations of her compatriots, while SS Captain Munz became her tragic lover who was separated forever. After the Nazis surrendered, a large number of Dutch losers who had done nothing during the war began to smear their hatred. They concealed their cowardice through their perverted enthusiasm for the &quot;anti-rape&quot; movement. When &quot;Hate&quot; puts on a costume and the streets are full of actors, Rachel&#39;s heart-wrenching grievances and hatred can only be left alone by the Sea of ​​Galilee to die in silence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/bL7shqSwxMXSFexiFbunFiN7k2tHlj4r1JrCLb1E.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;566&quot; height= &quot;826&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/bL7shqSwxMXSFexiFbunFiN7k2tHlj4r1JrCLb1E.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258369&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>; &quot;Silent as the Sea&quot; (2&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;004&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;)&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This French film is as exquisite as prose poetry, with no impurities and direct The &quot;hate&quot; of justice is degraded by the gentle touch of the beautiful couple, and the restrained love of Gujing Youbo is transformed into the audience&#39;s long sigh. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of World War II, the invincible German army came to a beautiful French seaside town, breaking the peaceful life of the grandfather and granddaughter: the occupying army requisitioned one of their bedrooms for the captain with irresistible and polite words. Werner stayed. Considering that this is the third time that German soldiers have occupied France in 70 years since the Franco-Prussian War, and France suffered more than five million casualties in the last war, the grandfather and grandson are naturally hostile to everyone wearing German military boots. Never compromise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No way! Even the German officer who came to his house was like a male god in terms of truth, goodness and beauty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sentimental girl defends a national integrity from beginning to end, with a cold expression and never utters a word. At the same time, the captain&#39;s behavior was too beautiful. Through his extremely gentlemanly self-introduction, the audience discovered that the two of them shared each other&#39;s aesthetics, not to mention their values. It was hard not to be touched by a French heart. But she insisted on pouting her little mouth and not uttering a word, until the captain suddenly encountered danger, and the girl had to ignore everything at that moment and save him; until the captain suddenly said goodbye to him, saying that she would obey the order and go to the minus 40 degrees The Soviet front line - most likely to die, the girl broke the eternal silence, burst into tears, and faintly said to the captain the word she least wanted to say to him in this life: Goodbye. Just a word in the human world, yin and yang have parted forever. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Between humanity and justice, no one can do better than a girl. But what is horrifying when you think about it is that if the story of the girl calling the police to the German captain by playing the piano was known to the French anti-rape bureau after the war, the dignified and flawless heroine who later participated in the resistance activities would almost certainly be attacked by the heroine of &quot;Black Book&quot; The humiliating treatment of the protagonist. But in the eyes of today&#39;s audience, the girl&#39;s behavior at that moment shone with the most authentic beauty and should not be subject to any harsh criticism - unless the &quot;hate&quot; has deteriorated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, the three movies are all excellent. The theme of &quot;hate&quot; I chose can only cover one aspect of their excellence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 16 Nov 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[下属上班“摸鱼”被领导辱骂，法院判侵犯人格权]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260749]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-16 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;After the Civil Code incorporated personality rights into a separate codification, cases involving personality rights disputes accepted by courts across the country It has grown significantly.

After reading his interviews, I feel that his conducting and insights into music are indeed unique. Although I don’t know his background, I can’t help but pay attention to him because of his long-term cooperation with the Vienna Philharmonic and the Berlin Philharmonic. These two are the best symphony orchestras in my opinion! Soon I purchased the complete Beethoven symphonies conducted by Thielemann, but I never had time to listen to them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the autumn, I learned that Thielemann led the Dresden Staatskapelle to tour China, and when I saw that Wagner&#39;s &quot;Tannhäuser Overture&quot; was on the repertoire, I looked forward to hearing him live. The Staatskapelle Dresden is known as the oldest symphony orchestra in the world. It was founded in 1548 and has a history of 475 years. Since 1817, the composer Weber has been the conductor, and has gone through composers Wagner and Richard Strauss, as well as Adolf Bush, Fritz Reiner, Carl Böhm, Rudolf Kempe, Konveschny, The continuous training of a group of outstanding conductors such as Sinopoli, Haitink, Colin Davis, Sanderling and Blomstedt finally became a world-class orchestra famous for performing operas, including Weber, Wagner, Richard ·Strauss&#39;s works were also premiered by the orchestra one after another, creating a long and glorious history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The repertoire of Thielemann’s tour this time is mainly German and Austrian music. I didn’t have time to listen to the performance in Shanghai, so I had to take advantage of the opportunity to go to Beijing for business and listened to this performance on November 7. . The repertoire is Weber&#39;s &quot;Celebration Overture&quot;, Wagner&#39;s &quot;Tannhäuser Overture&quot;, Richard Strauss&#39;s &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; and &quot;Der Rosenkavalier Overture&quot;. These works were written by the three musicians who have the closest relationship with the orchestra, and should also be the best repertoire for the orchestra. What I really want to hear is the Tannhäuser Overture, which is one of my favorite works and I will listen to it again in a while. I have listened to no less than thirty or forty versions, but never heard it live. Thielemann + Dresden Staatskapelle + &quot;Tannhauser Overture&quot;, this is the best reason to listen to it live. This piece also tests the conductor and orchestra the most. In the recordings I have done, few conductors and orchestras can play it well. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Dresden Staatskapelle under Thielemann&#39;s baton opened with the first &quot;Celebration Overture&quot;. It felt like the musicians hadn&#39;t warmed up yet, and their voices were light and fluttery, without any solid sound. It was a celebration. The color is a bit light. The number of people in the band was not large enough. There were only about 80 people in the band of more than 130 people, and the volume was not enough. Before the performance of the second &quot;Tannhauser Overture&quot;, several more musicians came up, but the total number was less than a hundred. The melody and timbre are generally good, but it obviously lacks a bit of grand solemnity and rising atmosphere. The rhythm processing at the beginning is a bit unique and the speed is slightly faster, which does not convey the gradually increasing solemnity of the music. In the middle part, the &quot;call of temptation&quot; played by the violins in unison, and the rapid sound groups played repeatedly by the violins basically failed to produce the magic that the melody should have. The brass music at the end also seemed not powerful enough, and the rising feeling at the climax could not be conveyed. In short, my feeling is that the band composition is a bit small and cannot achieve the shocking effect it should have. Among the dozens of versions I have heard, the two most wonderful are Solti&#39;s. The Vienna Philharmonic version is better than the Chicago Symphony Orchestra version. Friends who are interested will know what is lacking in the Dresden Staatskapelle conducted by Thielemann after listening to it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two Richard Strauss works &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; and &quot;Der Rosenkavalier Overture&quot; in the second half were very successful. Richard Strauss and the Staatskapelle Dresden collaborated for more than 60 years, and nine operas were premiered by the orchestra, including the &quot;Der Rosenkavalier Overture&quot;. These two works in the second half finally revived the orchestra’s spirit. The Staatskapelle Dresden is responsible for both opera and concert performances. Apart from opera, they are best at German and Austrian classical music. Music critics highly praise the orchestra&#39;s elegant style and balance of parts, saying they are different from others. Unique sound from other Western European orchestras. It is difficult to appreciate these characteristics in just one concert, but the overall level and artistic expression of the orchestra can still be felt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the short overture &quot;Sunrise&quot; of &quot;Thus Spake Zarathustra&quot; is familiar because it was used as the theme music of the movie &quot;Star Wars&quot;, I have rarely listened to the entire work. , not familiar with it. What is certain is that Thielemann and the orchestra perfectly demonstrated the orchestral charm created by Richard Strauss&#39;s colorful musical ideas and gorgeous orchestration, and there was no sense of fatigue when listening to the whole piece. The peculiar structure of the &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; Overture - the density of the sound of the two three-beat parts and the sharp contrast with the other two parts, well demonstrated the tension between them under Thielemann&#39;s conductor. The number of members in the band also increased slightly. In the last part of the piece, Thielemann&#39;s dramatic commanding movements made all the musicians on the stage excited and released their energy, bringing the atmosphere to a climax. When the music ended, the applause was thunderous and lasting. Thielemann took his final bow several times, but the audience still refused to give up, but in the end there was no &quot;encore&quot; (encore) to thank the audience for their enthusiasm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although I was not satisfied with the performance in the first half, I felt that the performance in the second half was worth the price of admission. This tour by Thielemann and the Dresden Staatskapelle was obviously quite successful, and the music fans praised it as the best concert of the year. The last time I went to the National Center for the Performing Arts was to listen to Abbado conducting the Berlin Philharmonic&#39;s Mahler. Fast forward many years, and on the eve of the beginning of winter, Thielemann&#39;s Dresden Staatskapelle gave me the last concert of autumn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People are subject to change, but music is endless. Thielemann, can you bring the Vienna Philharmonic next year? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 16 Nov 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
