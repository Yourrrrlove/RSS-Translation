The listed prices of gold in different brand stores are different, all above 600 yuan per gram, and some are as high as 600 yuan per gram. The gold price is 610 yuan per gram, but there are basically price discounts ranging from 20 to 40 yuan. According to many staff on site, the price of gold has dropped by a few yuan from the peak last week. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for recycling services, only a few brands provide them and the recycling prices are low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the staff of Tianhe City China Gold Store, the gold price after discount is 568 yuan per gram, and the recycling price is 405 yuan per gram.

They all said that the recycling price was 465 yuan per gram, and the price was 465 yuan per gram in the same city. You can come to your door for recycling and pay on the spot; but if the store is in other cities, it needs to be evaluated online. The consumer takes a photo of the store link and mails it to the merchant. After the merchant signs and checks the gram number, the merchant pays the consumer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that the recycling prices of gold jewelry of different brands are different online and offline, and there is a big difference. For the wholesale market, it is generally 8-10 yuan less than the gold price sold; for brand stores in supermarkets , the difference is more than 100 yuan; while the online recycling price is 2 yuan more than that in the offline wholesale market. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Some supermarkets need to pay nearly a thousand yuan for redemption&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“I just received a customer to redeem.” The reporter said Visiting supermarket brands also found that although many brand stores do not recycle gold and can only exchange old items for new ones, and the method is complicated, many consumers come to consult or exchange for the styles they like. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Trade-in means that the gold products in the hands of consumers are discounted according to the current gold price and then purchased in-store at the current selling price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/086b9e703a353149adb07af4c5f76fde.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;4032&quot; height=&quot;3024&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/086b9e703a353149adb07af4c5f76fde.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251168&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hengtai Jewelry Store on Changshou West Road in Liwan District, Guangzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the staff of Lao Fengxiang, if you want to exchange for gold that is not of this brand, based on the gold listing price of the brand that day is 608 yuan per gram, the discount per gram you want to exchange is 30 yuan, and the number of grams must also be calculated. 10% off, 30% more grams purchased. In other words, if you have 10 grams of gold to redeem, which is originally 6,080 yuan, you need to calculate the price based on 9 grams of 578 yuan, which is 5,202 yuan, and an additional 3 grams of gold, which is 1,824 yuan, for the total exchange price That’s 7026 yuan. In other words, you need to make a minimum payment of 946 yuan to redeem it, and the crafting fee is additional. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similarly, China Gold, Chow Tai Fook and other stores have different discounts for redemption. Among them, China Gold staff said that if you want to exchange for gold that is not of the same brand, you will have to pay a price difference of 40 yuan per gram, and there is no labor fee. You can choose the type and quantity of the exchange. According to the staff of Chow Tai Fook, there are two options. If you have 10 grams of gold to redeem, first, you need to exchange for a product heavier than 10 grams, and the discount is calculated as 85 yuan per gram; second, use the selling price of the day, exchange for a product with twice the gram, that is, 20 grams. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the gold wholesale business district of Changshou West Road, reporters also found that many consumers exchanged for gold products. At noon on September 18, two Guangzhou citizens in their 50s brought 10.06 grams of gold chains to change styles and walked into a gold store. A sign hanging outside the gold store read &quot;Old gold for new, one gram for one gram.&quot; According to reports, the gold chain is charged based on the recycling price of 463 yuan plus 15% handicraft fee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 14:55:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[安徽十元“盒饭姐”爆火后流泪，围观的边界感在哪？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256956]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[苹果“芯”，闭环未完成丨科创要闻]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256950]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 11:57:16&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/19/EF18nz4G745NrZGbfXK5vE46XmfTmtmdvfpRt0BX.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1423&quot; height=&quot;692&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/EF18nz4G745NrZGbfXK5vE46 XmfTmtmdvfpRt0BX. png&quot; data-key=&quot;251156&quot; data-mce-width=&quot;0&quot; data-mce-height=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Communications &amp;amp; Chip&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;h5>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://investor.qualcomm.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1351/qualcomm-announces-agreement-with-apple-for-chip-supply&quot;>;&lt;strong>; Qualcomm and Apple reached a three-year chip supply agreement&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;On September 11, Qualcomm announced that it had reached a new agreement with Apple.

In 2010, Apple introduced Qualcomm&#39;s 3G/4G baseband products for the first time on the iPhone 4. Since 2011, Qualcomm has become the exclusive supplier of iPhone basebands and takes 5% of the sales price as a patent licensing fee. Around 2018, disputes broke out between the two parties during contract renewal negotiations for 5G baseband chips, and they initiated patent lawsuits against each other. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold; &quot;>;At the same time, Apple is also trying to create a closed loop of self-developed chips. In July 2019, it acquired most of Intel&#39;s mobile phone baseband chip business for US$1 billion. In March 2021, it invested in the construction of a new European semiconductor laboratory in Munich, with the first phase of investment. 1 billion euros. According to the six-year licensing agreement reached between Apple and Qualcomm in 2019, Apple will stop purchasing 5G baseband chips from Qualcomm after 2024. However, judging from this supply agreement, although Apple’s 3nm process chips are currently leading the commercial market, self-developed baseband chips are still on the way, and Qualcomm cannot be untied yet.

The court found that: From 1993 to 1996, Yu Huaying, together with Gong Mouliang (deceased), traveled around Guizhou Province, Chongqing City and other places to find suitable children for abduction and trafficking. After they succeeded, the two took the abducted children to A total of 11 children were abducted and trafficked in Handan City, Hebei Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yu Huaying expressed her right to appeal in court, which also showed that she was neither satisfied with the verdict nor wanted to die. However, thinking about the 11 children who were deceived, kidnapped and trafficked by her, which parent would not hate her to the core? &amp;nbsp;When a child disappears, parents become furious, shed tears, and look for it locally or across the country. Normal life and work are disrupted, joy is lost, and families are broken up. In this process, some parents fall into self-blame and are unable to extricate themselves. Their lives have lost meaning, or they have given up on themselves, or died in depression. Some parents have given up hope at a certain point, but the wounds in their hearts that will never heal will often feel dull pain or even... In acute attacks, there are also parents who are unwilling to give up and will not stop. However, given the size of China, it is extremely difficult to find their children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the court hearing, there were family members of the victims and even those who were trafficked and are now adults but will always be &quot;children&quot; in the eyes of their parents. Yang Niuhua was one of them. In the process of bringing Yu Huaying to justice and giving him the punishment he deserved, Yang Niuhua played an irreplaceable role. It was her persistence and perseverance that allowed Yu Huaying to be finally arrested, and we were able to see what happened on September 18 That scene. In a word, Yang Niuhua is a well-deserved and admirable hero. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1990, Yang Niuhua was born in Zhijin County, Guizhou. She is the youngest daughter in the family. She has a happy family and many unforgettable childhood memories. It is these indelible memories that have become her heart The eternal light helped her find her way home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yu Huaying and her gang lived near Yang Niuhua&#39;s house. She was &quot;very good to herself and her sister. She would take them shopping and buy things.&quot; One day, when there were no adults at home, Yu Huaying defrauded and abducted 5-year-old Yang Niuhua for 2,500 yuan. Yang Niuhua will never forget: After being tricked into boarding the train, Yu Huaying immediately changed into a fierce face, not only punched and kicked her, but also poured boiling water from the thermos directly onto her head, in order to &quot;reduce management&quot; Cost” obedience training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2012, Yang Niuhua began a long journey to find her relatives. In April 2021, she posted information about searching for relatives on a short video platform, recalling every moment of getting along with her family: she fell into a puddle and almost drowned, and her sister cried beside her when she climbed up; she fell from a pig pen and suffered a bloody head. Flow, my sister went to find her mother crying behind her back. On May 3 of the same year, Yang Niuhua’s video aroused the concern of a girl named Yang in Zhijin County, Guizhou. She had heard from her elders since she was a child that a cousin was lost in 1995. After DNA comparison and confirmation, Yang Niuhua, who had been abducted for 26 years, finally embarked on her way home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unfortunately, after she was abducted, her father passed away in 1997 due to excessive drinking due to sadness, and her mother also passed away the next year due to being unable to bear the mental shock, leaving her sister as an orphan. Later, her sister told her that at night, her parents would take her to the train station to find someone, and they would lay bunks on the station floor at night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an interview with the media, Yang Niuhua said: &quot;When I didn&#39;t find a home before, I never thought about looking for human traffickers. It was only after I found my home that there were so many changes in my home that I made up my mind. We are looking for human traffickers.&quot; In June 2022, Yang Niuhua provided clues to the Guizhou police. 24 days later, Yu Huaying was captured by the Nanming Branch of the Guiyang Municipal Public Security Bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, the Nanming District Procuratorate of Guiyang City prosecuted Yu Huaying for the crime of &quot;child abduction and trafficking.&quot; According to Wang Wenguang, Yang Niuhua’s attorney, the prosecutor initially recommended a 14-year prison sentence. Yang Niuhua was not satisfied with this sentencing recommendation. She entrusted a lawyer to apply to transfer the case from the Nanming District Court of Guiyang City to the Intermediate Court of Guiyang City for trial. We have all seen the following parts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 11 child trafficking cases that Yu Huaying was accused of this time did not include the cases that had been tried and closed before, nor did they include her own son that she sold. It was the proceeds from this time that made her Tasted the sweetness and blood, I couldn&#39;t stop it from now on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Southern Weekend, during the trial, Yu Huaying apologized twice to the abducted family, hoping to gain their understanding and hope that the court would give him a lighter punishment. But Yang Niuhua found it difficult to accept Yu Huaying&#39;s apology. Such intolerance shows justice and bloodshed! There is a classic dialogue in &quot;The Analects of Confucius&quot;, which may be said: How about repaying evil with kindness? Confucius said: How to repay virtue? Repay vengeance with straightness and repay kindness with kindness. When a person suffers great harm, is deprived of rights, insulted, and loses his original life, he certainly has the right to demand the justice he deserves from the perpetrator. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The victim has the right to demand justice, and whether he or she can finally get justice are, of course, two different things. The former cannot automatically lead to the latter, but requires the victim himself to &quot;do merit.&quot; Yang Niuhua did not let go of the human traffickers. Her direct motive was to seek justice for herself and her parents. At the same time, she also sought justice for all the abducted children and their families, and also for us. This society has established a sense of integrity and integrity. Be subjective for yourself, objectively benefit others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Go further, punish evil and promote good. If you don’t punish evil, how can you promote good? It is the greatest mockery of good and justice for the bad guys to end up good. Only when there is more and more righteousness and bloodiness in this society, those with evil intentions will have scruples and think twice before doing evil things, and we will be able to enjoy greater freedom and security. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[赛百味700亿卖身：降不住中国胃的轻食还会越吃越肥？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256932]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/18/c01164b14aab8acb3eb16ac74acd8b48.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;721&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/c01164b14aab8acb3eb16ac74acd8b48. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251105&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;（IC photo&amp;nbsp;/图）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, the world-famous Fast food chain Subway has successfully &quot;sold itself out&quot;. According to its official website, it agreed to the acquisition proposal from private equity firm Roark Capital, with an acquisition price of approximately RMB 70 billion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As soon as the news came out, it immediately became a trending topic. Many foodies left messages lamenting that the fast food chain Big Mac, which had more stores than McDonald&#39;s and KFC at its peak, is no longer popular. Data shows that Subway has been in operating difficulties since 2014. As of November 2022, the number of Subway stores worldwide has decreased by nearly 8,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In China, Subway&#39;s stores are mainly concentrated in first- and second-tier cities. A sandwich sells for 30 yuan. It focuses on being &quot;healthier&quot; than ordinary fast food. It has been famous for providing freshly customized sandwiches, wraps, salads, etc. It is widely popular in weight loss and fitness circles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, as competition in the catering industry intensifies, under the name of health, waves of ketogenic diets, meal replacements, and sugar replacements come one after another, and various &quot;fat-reducing diets&quot; &quot;Meals&quot; are emerging one after another. Gradually, Subway&#39;s sandwiches have lost their originality and are no longer fashionable in the eyes of Chinese foodies who pursue healthy consumption. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;An endless stream of weight loss meals&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In order to successfully lose weight, people take great pains in their diet, and this can always be captured by keen merchants, so over the years, diets in the name of weight loss have Wave after wave. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meal replacement is quite popular nowadays. Meal replacement, as the name suggests, can replace part or all of the main meals. It is a type of food that quickly, conveniently and quantitatively provides the human body with appropriate amounts of protein, fat, carbohydrates, fiber and other necessary nutrients. There are meal replacement powders and meal replacement milks. Shakes, meal replacement porridge, meal replacement snacks, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meal replacement was initially mainly targeted at patients with certain diseases, astronauts, mountaineers and other people. Later, it quickly became popular among weight loss people, and the market scale expanded rapidly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Tmall statistics, sales of meal replacement light food products in 2021 increased by 290% year-on-year. The number of meal replacement consumers increased by 78% in three years, and the per capita annual consumption amount has exceeded 3,000 yuan. . Statistics from global market research company Euromonitor International show that in 2017, China&#39;s meal replacement market size was approximately 57.17 billion yuan, and is expected to reach 120 billion yuan in 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Substitute sugar is similar to meal replacement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sugar substitutes have a sweetness similar to sucrose, but do not produce calories or have very low calories. This is most common in beverages and snacks, which are all labeled with &quot;zero sugar&quot; and &quot;zero calories&quot; to tell consumers that they can satisfy their cravings without gaining weight. For example, drinks represented by Yuanqi Forest under the banner of &quot;zero sugar&quot; adjust the taste by adding sugar substitutes &quot;erythritol&quot; and &quot;sucralose&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the stereotype of some dieters, sugar and carbohydrates are the main culprits of obesity, so in addition to avoiding sugar, some people also do everything possible to reduce or even eliminate carbohydrates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ketogenic diet, which rejects all carbohydrates, has become popular. The traditional Chinese eating habits are too high in carbohydrates, and the ketogenic diet goes to the other extreme: only eating lean meats and vegetables, and not eating staple foods containing carbohydrates, thereby producing a large amount of ketone bodies and forcing the body to burn fat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next step is the fat-reducing meal. Simply put, it is a meal that can reduce fat. It is generally less oil, less salt, and low in calories. Unlike the ketogenic diet, its nutrition is relatively balanced. Most diets for weight loss are not delicious. Fat-reduction meals now stand out on social platforms because they can be &quot;delicious&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, some people found hope in the burgers and fried chicken of the carbohydrate giant. On the one hand, burgers and chicken legs can not only provide excellent protein and necessary fat for the human body, but on the other hand, their calories are not as high as imagined. For example, some burgers only have 450 calories. The daily caloric intake of adult women in my country is about 1,800 kilocalories, and that of adult men is 2,250 kilocalories, so eating a hamburger for one meal is not a big problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with other weight-loss meals, fat-reducing meals are becoming a major source of traffic on social platforms. Other weight-loss meals can basically only be bought from merchants, which are unpalatable and expensive. However, fat-loss meals are suitable for DIY. There are a wide variety of menus to share on social platforms. All kinds of food are available. They are delicious and can help you lose weight. Why not? for? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/af1c4b7c289a7bcdee642927260594ac.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/af1c4b7c289a7bcdee642927260594ac.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251104&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;（IC photo &amp;nbsp;/图）&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;It may not work&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;But, can Internet celebrity weight loss meals really help you lose weight? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, many Internet celebrity weight loss meals are specious and just seek psychological comfort. For example, the various meal replacement snacks that have become popular in the past two years, such as oatmeal brittle, compressed biscuits, cereal yogurt, and instant corn flakes, are not low in sugar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although some sugar substitute biscuits replace sucrose with sugar substitute and wheat flour with coarse grain flour rich in dietary fiber, the main ingredient is still starch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another example is the popular salad set on the takeout platform, which is piled with vegetables, fruits and some meat, and looks very healthy. In fact, although fruits supplement vitamins, their sugar content is not low; avocados are not low in fat; a few grains of purple/brown rice just look like whole grains and are probably refined carbohydrates; more importantly, there are various sauces that enhance the taste. Ingredients, the calories are very likely to explode...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Salad sets on takeout platforms often do not provide accurate energy tables, but merchants with little nutrition knowledge prepare them at will, and consumers spend more money. Just buy a psychological comfort. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if it may not work, Internet celebrity weight loss meals may also bring health risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, although meal replacement is a way to supplement nutrients and reduce energy intake, the nutrients in meal replacement cannot replace a balanced diet, and studies have shown that long-term consumption of meal replacement shakes , will affect intestinal peristalsis, reduce metabolism, and in severe cases may cause endocrine disorders in the body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same goes for sugar substitute products. After eating sugar, the human body will automatically undergo a glucose metabolism reaction. If you eat sugar substitutes but do not take in the required calories, the normal glucose metabolism reaction will be weakened, resulting in a subsequent decrease in glucose tolerance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ketogenic diet carries greater risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the standards of the &quot;Dietary Guidelines for Chinese Residents&quot;, 55%-65% of adults&#39; daily energy intake should come from carbohydrates. A ketogenic diet that refuses carbohydrates will cause insufficient energy for the body, leading to side effects such as fatigue, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and irregular heartbeat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A study in &quot;The Lancet&quot; showed that there is a U-shaped relationship between carbohydrate intake and life expectancy. A low-carbohydrate diet will reduce life expectancy by up to 4 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The biggest bug with various fat-reducing meals is that we can eat them for a month to achieve the goal of reducing fat, but can we eat them for a lifetime? Once it fails, the next problem will be: rebound. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A senior nutritionist pointed out: &quot;A single food weight loss method actually deviates from a healthy dietary pattern. The result is that the more you reduce your basal metabolism, the lower your basal metabolism will be, and the rebound will be more severe.&quot; Long-term deficit habit The body will fully absorb them when exposed to carbohydrates and fats to help the body return to normal operating levels, and the weight will rebound quickly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Isn&#39;t this just &quot;losing your wife and losing your troops&quot;? The operation was as fierce as a tiger, but in the end it returned to the same way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/3710cf01919af6f3692376196c081165.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/3710cf01919af6f3692376196c081165.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251108&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;（IC photo &amp;nbsp;/图）&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Shut up and open your legs&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;What is the truly effective way to lose weight? ? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, it is the clichéd six words, &quot;Shut up and open your legs.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Keeping your mouth shut does not mean not to eat, but it means to control your diet appropriately and ensure a balanced diet. The &quot;Reference Intake of Dietary Nutrients for Chinese Residents&quot; clearly states: The recommended dietary energy supply ratio for adults is 50%-65% carbohydrates, 20%-30% fat, and 10%-15% protein. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Humans are not machines. Only by consuming sufficient and balanced nutrients can normal metabolism be maintained. Of course, overeating is not advisable, but if you diet blindly, once the intake cannot cover the basal metabolism, it will have a negative effect on the body, causing muscle and bone loss. Therefore, any kind of weight loss meal must be based on health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person’s fatness or thinness is not only related to the total daily caloric intake, but also related to the total daily caloric consumption. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If there is a calorie surplus, the body will gain weight. If calorie consumption is greater than calorie intake, then the body will lose weight. To successfully lose weight, your total energy intake should be less than your total energy expenditure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many internet celebrity weight loss meals focus on reducing intake, but their low energy intake has fallen below the bottom line of health. The healthy fat loss formula is: caloric consumption >; caloric intake >; calories required for basal metabolism. The body&#39;s caloric deficit is between 10% and 15% of total consumption. The best way to burn calories is to spread your legs and move. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So it’s better to just “keep your mouth shut and open your legs” if you follow all kinds of celebrity weight-loss meals on the Internet and the prices are quite low. Maintaining a normal and balanced diet while ensuring a certain amount of exercise may not make you lose weight immediately, but it will give you a well-proportioned figure and a healthy body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[如何评价历史人物？从“被泼脏水”的隋炀帝说起]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256914]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Over the years, there are probably very few &quot;tyrants&quot; in history who have not been demonstrated by researchers or history buffs He is &quot;actually a talented and strategic monarch&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Indeed, the images of many &quot;tyrants&quot; left in history books, especially their images in traditional literature, are often far from their historical prototypes. After a change of dynasty, if the new dynasty wants to prove its legitimacy, the history books will throw dirty water on it. The identity of the &quot;tyrant&quot; has been recognized, and folk literature and art like to use him to tell erotic and violent stories - after all, deep in human nature, there is such a hobby, but it is not appropriate to place this hobby on a good person, so the &quot;tyrant&quot; &quot;It&#39;s always good to make it very pornographic and violent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fate of popular emperors in literary and artistic works such as Shang Zhou and Sui Yang Emperor is probably always like this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the question is, peel off the outer layer of skin, what is the inner layer exposed? Let’s take Emperor Yang of Sui Dynasty as an example. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty first came to the throne, he inherited a powerful empire that had not been seen for hundreds of years after the fall of the Han Dynasty, and it was also a huge powder keg. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, long-term divisions have been unified in a very short period of time, and some people are dissatisfied with the current regime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, his father, Emperor Wen of the Sui Dynasty, had some important institutional reforms and policy practices, which were very beneficial from the national level, but felt uncomfortable at the social level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, the household registration management in the Sui Dynasty was particularly good. According to official population statistics, the population has increased from 29 million to 46 million in less than 30 years. These 17 million people are definitely not just the result of everyone trying their best to have children when the world is at peace, but the population that was originally hidden has all been plundered. From the perspective of the imperial court, the country had extremely abundant manpower and material resources at its disposal. However, if you look at the perspective of ordinary people at that time, these people did not have to pay taxes or serve in the military. Now all these burdens have been placed on them, and they are not necessarily happy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If these people are all in disarray, there is nothing they can do even if they are dissatisfied. But Emperor Wen of the Sui Dynasty also made another major reform, which was to change the three-level local administration of state-prefecture-county to the second-level state-county administration, and abolish the county level. As a result, tens of thousands of people, from county chiefs to ordinary officials, were about to be laid off. From a national level, this is reducing staff and increasing efficiency. But with so many officials losing their vested interests, they will definitely be furious. If the Sui Dynasty returned all the savings to the people, then the people should be very happy to see these people lose their official positions. But the problem is that the Sui Dynasty concentrated all the profits in the court, and the people of the Sui Dynasty did not get any benefits from this reform that could have benefited them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above two reforms, together with other new policies, resulted in a great increase in the income of the Sui Dynasty and a decrease in expenditure. Therefore, many scholars have noticed that when it comes to ancient dynasties, it is said that In terms of &quot;national wealth&quot;, it is unmatched by the Sui Dynasty. But at the same time, this also means that as long as someone wants to rebel, there will immediately be tens of thousands of unemployed officials with administrative organizational skills, and tens of millions of dissatisfied people who can take advantage of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty was completely unaware of the existence of this problem. He was from a good background, had a smooth life since childhood, and was really smart. He had no ability to empathize with the pain of ordinary people. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He only saw that there were so many resources in the court now, so he wanted to do big things, so he dug the Grand Canal and conquered Liaodong three times, which were all extreme tests of social endurance. It was not that Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty did not feel that his throne was threatened, but it was not from this huge powder keg, but from the Guanlong Group that the Sui Dynasty relied on for its success. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before becoming emperor, Emperor Sui Yang was particularly successful in commanding the war in the south. His ability to win over the southern nobles far exceeded that of the older generation of famous generals and ministers of the Guanlong Group. This gave him the illusion that I have new forces available, and you are nothing special. This intensified the division of the ruling group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this way, the excluded Guanlong dignitaries at the top, the laid-off officials at the middle level, and the ordinary people at the grassroots level who are overwhelmed by heavy labor and taxes will have full anger from top to bottom. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Emperor Sui Yang was indeed not the nymphomaniac or sadist in literary works, but when faced with the challenge, he seemed completely unqualified as a politician. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You are too willful when things are going well. I don’t want you to think so. I want you to think that you can’t do things and never give up even if you hit a wall. But when it comes to adversity, they lack resilience and willpower, and their willpower collapses immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The world was in chaos. When Emperor Sui Yang arrived in Jiangdu, he actually no longer expected to recapture the north. But his troops were all from the north, and they were afraid of not going back, so they were discussing rebellion. A palace maid heard the news and told Queen Xiao. Empress Xiao is still very smart, so you can speak for yourself. As soon as the result was mentioned, Emperor Sui Yang became furious. Are you qualified to say this? Just kill this palace maid. Later, there were more and more news that the army was going to rebel. Queen Xiao told the people in the palace that there was no need to talk to His Majesty. Why add to his worries? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, in terms of the combat effectiveness of Emperor Sui Yang&#39;s army at that time, it was still very powerful, but at the last moment of his life, Emperor Sui Yang had given up treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The summary is that as a political figure, Emperor Sui Yang:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, he was unable to reconcile complex political and social contradictions;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, Failed to build a core team that was loyal to itself and capable;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, there was no awareness of changing course when the situation started to go unfavorable;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fourth, there was no persistence when the situation was very unfavorable. will. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the things he did, such as building the Grand Canal, you might as well look at it this way: When discussing long-term history, even if a person is an emperor, his influence may not be that important. The study of factors such as finance and taxation, technology diffusion, productivity, economic and social structure is enough to explain the problem, and it might as well not involve character evaluation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To evaluate a character, you need to look at the history of a short period of time. A short period of time in the historical sense is a lifetime for ordinary people. The great social collapse of the late Sui Dynasty triggered by Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty caused the death and displacement of tens of millions of people. This is real. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, traditional history books and literary works often apply too much paint to characters. This problem does exist. But if you think the truth is revealed by turning traditional records over, you might as well save it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is the author&#39;s personal opinion only and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[人贩余华英获死刑，受害家庭：“几十年的辛酸，终于清楚了”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256948]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 10:16:43&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/09/19/f6b4e7615e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/ 19/f6b4e7615e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251151&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 18, 2023, Yu Huaying was charged with child trafficking. Sentenced to death. (Guiyang Intermediate People’s Court/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 18, 2023, the Guiyang Intermediate People’s Court publicly pronounced the verdict on the defendant Yu Huaying’s crime of child abduction. Yu Huaying was sentenced to death for child abduction, deprived of political rights for life, and confiscated all personal property. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the video shot by the media, Yang Niuhua read the verdict to the parents looking for relatives at the door of the court, hoping that they could all see hope. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yang Niuhua was abducted and trafficked by Yu Huaying when she was 5 years old. She successfully found her relatives 25 years later. In 2022, Yang Niuhua reported the case to the police and provided clues, and the child abduction and trafficking case of Yu Huaying was officially filed. (For details, please see the relevant report &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/contents/253854?source=134&quot;>;Human trafficker Yu Huaying was sentenced to death: abducted 11 children and also sold her own son&lt;/a a>;》)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The trial by Guiyang Intermediate People’s Court found that the defendant Yu Huaying collaborated with Gong Mouliang (deceased) from 1993 to 1996 for profit Illegal interests circulated in Guizhou Province, Chongqing City and other places, looking for suitable children to abduct and traffic. After they succeeded, the two took the abducted children to Handan City, Hebei Province, and through the introduction of Wang Moufu and Yang Moulan, they found a buyer for the sale. , profiting from this, during which a total of 11 children were abducted. The Guiyang Intermediate Court held that the defendant Yu Huaying had repeatedly abducted and trafficked children in order to obtain illegal profits. His behavior constituted the crime of child abduction. The crime was particularly serious and extremely harmful to society and should be severely punished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yu Huaying appealed in court. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“I hope she will die, but I don’t want her to die”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although it was only a first-instance verdict, Cai Huiying, a family member of the victim who attended the sentencing, Feeling devastated, she told her relatives on the phone: &quot;We have finally figured it out after decades of hardship and fatigue. We finally understand.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; &quot;>;After Cai Huiying walked out of the court, she started calling her family. The first one is the abducted party - his younger brother Cai Zhansheng. Cai Shengsheng was 6 years old when he was abducted in Zunyi and disappeared with his brother. A few months later, the elder brother came back alone without seeing his younger brother. It was not until the end of 2022, after the Yu Huaying case was filed, that Cai Shengsheng went home through DNA comparison. Thirty years later, Cai Zhansheng can no longer remember many details, but he still remembers Yu Huaying with high cheekbones and a long face. Cai Huiying said that her brother was also very happy to learn that Yu Huaying was sentenced to death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Cai Huiying called her parents for the second time. After his younger brother was lost, his father insisted on going out to look for his relatives for more than 20 years, traveling to Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Henan, Jiangxi and other places. Wherever there was news, my father immediately went out to verify it. He went out with hope again and again, but his hope was shattered again and again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Logically speaking, my father should hate Yu Huaying very much. But two months ago, when my father learned that the prosecutor recommended the death penalty for Yu Huaying in the first trial, &quot;the first sentence he said was that I hope she (Yu Huaying) dies, but I don&#39;t want her to die.&quot; Cai&#39;s father hopes that Yu Huaying will be sentenced to death because she has brought endless harm and pain to his family; he does not want her to die, but he wants to give her some time to tell the story of the children who have been abducted and trafficked over the years, so that more parents can Find the child. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Cai Huiying replied to her father: &quot;This is our common idea, but can she do it?&quot; Cai Huiying once attended the first trial. At that time, Yu Hua Ying expressed that he was &quot;unclear&quot; and &quot;cannot remember&quot; many of the circumstances of the crime. Only when talking about his son and daughter, Yu Huaying burst into tears and choked with sobs. This made Cai Huiying quite angry, and she clenched her fists from time to time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yu Huaying abducted 11 children, involving 8 families. This time the court pronounced its verdict, and relatives from five families came to listen. One mother had two sons abducted, another mother had a son and a daughter abducted, and yet another mother had a son abducted. When Cai Huiying saw the mother who came from Zunyi, after Yu Huaying was sentenced to death, she stood up with excitement and seemed to want to beat her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During lunch, Cai Huiying chatted with several mothers about their respective situations: the children of five families were recovered one after another after Yang Niuhua reported the crime. However, the relationship between the biological family and the foster family is quite complex. Some abducted children find it difficult to cope with the situation, fail to accept family recognition, and rarely come back for reunions. &quot;But we are all grateful to Niuhua, because she reported the crime and we were able to find our relatives.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The regret of broken family ties has appeared in many victim families. In Dazu, Chongqing, Bai Ticai, whose son was abducted by Yu Huaying, was completely unaware of the court verdict. He told Southern Weekend reporters that the child had never seen him since the spring of 2020 when he recognized his relatives, and the two had lost contact. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/7486ba21cd.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1706&quot; height=&quot;1280&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/7486ba21cd.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251152&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 18, 2023, parents looking for relatives gathered outside the gate of Guiyang Intermediate Hospital. (Photo provided by interviewee)&lt;/p>; &lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Encourage parents looking for relatives to &quot;don&#39;t give up&quot;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;On September 18, outside the gate of Guiyang Intermediate Court, there were still three floors inside and three floors outside surrounded by parents who came to look for relatives, just as they did during the court hearing in July. Everyone held a family-searching information board in front of their chests, on which the information about the abducted children was printed in the most conspicuous yellow letters on a red background. The children were still young when they were abducted, and the printed photos show them when they were one or two years old, and most of them are blurry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the court hearing in July, Southern Weekend reporters saw An Shiming, who came to search for his son. He came to the court door early holding a family search information board to broadcast live. This time when the verdict was announced, he once again came early with some parents looking for relatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When Cai Huiying arrived before 8 o&#39;clock, more parents saw this search than at the first trial. She stood far away and did not dare to walk into the crowd. &quot;I felt that as soon as I stood there and heard what they said, I naturally couldn&#39;t control the emotion.&quot; For parents who are still looking for relatives, Cai Huiying feels that what she can say is feeble: &quot;Have more courage and continue.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yang Niuhua Dare to speak to parents looking for relatives. In a live media broadcast after the trial, she once again encouraged parents looking for their children not to give up. She mentioned her own example: the first time she took blood to find her relatives was in 2012, but there has been no news in the past ten years. But in 2021, in just over a month, she miraculously found her home through the short video platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After finding a home, Yang Niuhua lived in Hebei, Yu Huaying was in Chongqing, and the trafficking case occurred in Guizhou. The three places were far apart. It seemed that it was very difficult to find human traffickers. Disaster. But now, Yu Huaying has been punished by law. &quot;Really never give up,&quot; Yang Niuhua said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Before and after every court session, Yang Niuhua’s schedule is tight and busy. On the one hand, families looking for relatives hope to take this opportunity to spread the information about finding relatives, and find her to live broadcast and record videos together; on the other hand, media interviews continue, and Yang Niuhua repeatedly recounts her experience of being abducted and the hardships of growing up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sister Sang Ying felt a little distressed when she saw Yang Niuhua always rushing ahead. Both sisters were actually victims. After Yang Niuhua was abducted in 1995, her parents were extremely sad and died in 1997 and 1998 respectively. Sangying lost her home and was forced to go out to work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[电诈受害者的银行卡困境:报案后要被冻结多久]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256940]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/18/2ea2e16682.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2048&quot; height=&quot;1365&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/2ea2e16682. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251128&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 10, 2023, the Beijing police were promoting anti-email fraud. Pictures and texts are irrelevant. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Within a week of being defrauded of more than 30,000 yuan, Shenzhen citizen Li Zheng kept asking the police, The bank proved that she was sober and would no longer transfer money to the scammer. On the day she was defrauded, all the debit cards and credit cards in her name were taken protective stop-payment measures by the police and could not be used. The reason was to prevent her from being defrauded again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called protective stop payment means that in order to protect the victim from further losses, the payment function of the bank card is stopped. Only transfers can be made, but transfers and cash withdrawals cannot be made. The customer service of Li Zheng&#39;s bank card bank informed him that the one-month payment stop measure for bank accounts that are likely to be defrauded again is consistent across the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The protective stop payment suddenly made Li Zheng unable to use her bank card to buy groceries, take a car, or even pay school fees for her children. She felt extremely inconvenienced. She found that she was not the only one trying to lift the protective stop payment. There were victims across the country who encountered the same problem. Many of them were still burdened with mortgages and were so anxious that they didn&#39;t know what to do. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The card was frozen after taking the initiative to report the crime&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On September 7, 2023, Li Zheng was on the noisy street when she received a fraud call. The other party asked her to confirm that her social account was in the security center. The &quot;million protection insurance&quot; is not free. Li Zheng hurried to do things and didn&#39;t want to pay attention to it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person on the other end of the phone said it would only take a few minutes, just follow the instructions to confirm. Li Zheng listened to the other party&#39;s voice on the road, and responded intermittently. He downloaded a &quot;bank APP&quot; according to the other party&#39;s request, entered different business numbers and order numbers back and forth, and tried to see whether the transfer was successful, starting from 7 yuan to 8 yuan. Small transfers ranging from RMB 20,000 to large transfers of more than 20,000 yuan. After turning the corner and walking into a secluded place, she suddenly realized that she had been cheated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zheng immediately hung up on the scammer and dialed 110 to call the police. At this time, she had transferred more than 30,000 yuan to the scammer, and she didn&#39;t know whether she could get it back. The Futian Police Station of the Futian Branch of the Shenzhen Municipal Public Security Bureau quickly received the call and called her to wait where she was for the time being. A police car would be sent to pick her up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Police from the police station took her for questioning and taking notes. Li Zheng said that at that time, the police only froze the suspect&#39;s account and did not mention that they would implement a protective stop payment on his bank card. The police also uploaded the report details to the national anti-fraud APP, and you can also see relevant information when you log in later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At 9 o&#39;clock that night, police officers from the Nanshan Branch Investment Police Station where Li Zheng lived came to her door, asked her if she had been defrauded, and spread anti-fraud knowledge to her. Li Zheng thought that the handling of the fraud case had come to an end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But when she was about to pay with her mobile phone the next day, she discovered that the two debit cards and one credit card in her name could no longer be used. After consulting the account bank, she learned that it was a protective stop payment operated by the anti-fraud police and was frozen for one month according to regulations. If she wanted to lift it, she could consult the Nanshan Branch Anti-Fraud Center. However, Li Zheng found that the call was not easy to get through, so he complained through the national anti-fraud hotline 96110. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, Li Zheng received police calls from Futian Police Station, Shenzhen Public Security Bureau, and Futian Branch. The answers they received were all &quot;In order to protect you from being deceived again, your bank card needs to be frozen for one month.&quot; Li Zheng did not agree with this. She took the initiative to report the crime when she realized that she had been deceived, and she also suffered property losses. &quot;How could it be possible to transfer money to the scammer again?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She believed that the stop-payment measure had caused her many problems. It is inconvenient that bank cards are needed for food and clothing at home and for company transactions. Now everything is &quot;immobilized&quot;. However, the credit card still needs to be repaid and may face the risk of overdue payment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 11, at Li Zheng’s strong request, the police accompanied her to withdraw more than 7,000 yuan from two cards. Despite this, she believes that it is still difficult to maintain daily life because the debit card cannot be transferred and the credit card cannot be used. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 12, a reporter from Southern Weekend called the Anti-Fraud Center of the Nanshan Branch to inquire. The staff of the Anti-Fraud Center stated that the bank card under Li Zheng’s name was indeed in a “protective stop payment” status and would stop payment within 48 hours. The payment will continue to circulate until one month. How to cancel it can be consulted with the Nanshan Branch. But before that, Li Zheng had communicated with the Nanshan Branch Investment Police Station many times, but the payment stop could not be lifted. Futian branch police told Southern Weekend reporters that what Li Zheng encountered was an ordinary telecommunications fraud case. The matter of lifting the protective stop payment has been communicated and coordinated with the Nanshan branch. More details of the case cannot be disclosed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Li Zheng rushed between two police stations, she discovered that the situation she encountered was not an isolated case. There were many victims of electronic fraud at the scene who came to complain about frozen bank cards. On the Internet, there are also victims on various social media asking how to lift the protective stop payment. Their ID addresses include Jiangsu, Hubei, Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, etc.: &quot;The stop payment on the 21st of last month has not been lifted yet. Do you know how to deal with it? &quot;I still have bank mortgages affected&quot;...&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The original intention is to prevent &quot;obsession&quot;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Guo Zhi, a lawyer at Beijing Yingke (Shenzhen) Law Firm Hao has been paying attention to card unfreezing cases for a long time and provides legal consultation on unfreezing cards. According to his understanding, the protective stop payment originally originated from the &quot;card disconnection&quot; operation in 2020. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to public information, on October 10, 2020, the State Council convened an inter-ministerial joint meeting to combat new illegal crimes in telecommunications networks and decided to launch a nationwide &quot;card disconnection&quot; operation from that date. The main purpose is to deal with a major root cause of the continued high incidence of telecom network fraud - the out-of-control management of phone cards and bank cards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawyer Guo Zhihao said that after the &quot;card disconnection&quot; campaign began, the number of bank cards frozen due to the inflow of unknown funds increased. He received hundreds of inquiries about unfreezing cards a week, among which protection Inquiries about sexual cessation of payment also appear occasionally, but the overall proportion is low. From 2020 to 2022, among the 100 cases inquiring about unfreezing cards, only one or two were protective stop payments; since 2023, the number of consultations on such cases has increased, with four or five out of 100 cases. Regarding the protective stop payment, Guo Zhihao suggested that if the client does not need to use the bank card urgently, there is no need to find a lawyer to represent him, because most of them will be automatically lifted after one month, and &quot;the tossing and tossing is only a week or two in advance.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the reason for the increase in the number of stop-payment inquiries, Guo Zhihao did not find any new public documents in 2023. It should only be implementation adjustments in individual regions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found that since June 2023, public security agencies in many places across the country have issued the &quot;Notice on Carrying out Anti-Fraud Dissuasion and Protective Emergency Stop of Payments&quot;, in which the time and method of lifting the payment stop are specified. Different expressions: The Yuanzhou Branch of the Public Security Bureau of Yichun City, Jiangxi Province mentioned in an announcement on June 7: “If you have transferred money to the account involved in fraud, the branch will immediately implement a protective stop payment on your account, 48 It can be lifted on your own after an hour.&quot;; The Public Security Bureau of Xining City, Qinghai Province reminded in an announcement in August: &quot;If the bank account under your name only accepts payments but does not pay, please go to the nearest public security agency as soon as possible to explain the situation and request to lift the suspension. Pay and restore the normal use of the bank card.&quot; Guo Zhihao believes that the original intention of stopping payments in various places is the same, to prevent victims from being obsessed with transferring money to fraudulent accounts again, but there are no clear regulations on implementation standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporter contacted a victim who had been &quot;obsessed&quot; during the interview. Chen Qiang, a 27-year-old doctoral student in Guangzhou, was deeply involved in an investment and stock fraud group in July. It was a well-designed scam. When opening an account, the other party could verify it via video. The transfer provided was a third-party public account, and the company existed and was operating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Qiang was convinced and transferred &quot;investment&quot; to the account for three consecutive days. On July 19, the anti-fraud police took him to the police station and told him that he was transferring money to an &quot;early warning account.&quot; Chen Qiang didn&#39;t believe it at all. &quot;I can&#39;t be cheated.&quot; The police repeatedly &quot;educated&quot; him for two hours and asked him about his behavior. The account adopts a 48-hour emergency payment stop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Qiang was doubtful and told the scammer the information that he had been tipped to be deceived. The scammer first sent him a private message, telling him that he had also been called to the police station because of the company&#39;s bank account risk. The &quot;agency&quot; was currently investigating and it would not affect investment safety. The next day, the &quot;agency&quot; issued a processing notice. After several operations, Chen Qiang believed in the liar again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the emergency stop payment, Chen Qiang continued to transfer money to the scammer. It was not until a few days later that the scammer induced him to invest all his money. Chen Qiang suddenly realized that his more than 50,000 yuan had been locked and could not be withdrawn. . Chen Qiang admitted that it took him several days to get out of the scam, and the 48-hour emergency stop payment did play a role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This case is not rare. Wang Xueni, who lives in Zhejiang, was not aware of the problem when she was defrauded on August 11. It was not until the public security organs discovered that the fraudster&#39;s bank account had received transfers from her, prompting her that she was experiencing telecommunications network fraud. On the same day, she went to the police station to be questioned by the police, and all bank cards began to stop payment for 32 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another victim in Guangzhou, Lin Qingqing, was prompted by the police to report the crime to the local police station and take notes. However, Lin Qingqing said that the process of lifting the payment stop went smoothly. After filling out the &quot;Application Form for Lifting Protective Stop Payment&quot; at the Anti-Fraud Center, police from the police station near her residence came to verify and conduct anti-fraud propaganda. Soon her bank card was unfrozen. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Application Form for Lifting Protective Stop Payment&quot; posted by Lin Qingqing on her social account, in addition to basic information, the form also requires filling in &quot;whether you have met with the police to dissuade you&quot;; The purpose of the stopped payment bank card after the stop payment is lifted. The transaction details must indicate to whom the transfer is to be made, and the reasons for the transfer should be attached. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the process of lifting the payment stop is not smooth for many netizens. On Zhihu, a netizen with an IP address in Jiangxi said that the local police had stopped payment, and after the lifting, over-the-counter transactions were still restricted. A netizen in Jiangsu said that it would take 40 days to lift the local payment stop, and he had to go there in person; some people were very panicked. He said that he was about to repay the loan, and he didn’t know when the stop payment measure would be lifted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/f282d2ba16.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height= &quot;1707&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/f282d2ba16.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251129&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The &quot;Application Form for Lifting Protective Stop Payment&quot; posted online by Lin Qingqing. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Post-disaster reconstruction&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Chen Qiang describes his life after being cheated It is &quot;post-disaster reconstruction&quot;. He had been attending school all these years and what little savings he had was wiped out in this fraud. &quot;After being deceived, I would even hesitate to eat beef noodles for 15 yuan.&quot; Chen Qiang said, and what is even more suffocating is that such days are expected to continue for more than a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, he reflected on his greed and arrogance, and felt ridiculous about his performance when he first entered the police station, &quot;(his) attitude was very bad.&quot; After he came to his senses, he called the police who took the notes at the time and asked if there was any possibility of recovery. The other party told him that it was difficult to recover overseas fraud, not to mention that it had been too long since the transfer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, Chen Qiang hopes that &quot;post-disaster reconstruction&quot; will go smoothly. Seven days after he stopped transferring money and got out of the scam completely, he received a call from the public security bureau in his hometown, informing him that all bank card payments would be suspended for one month. &quot;After finally being defrauded, I looked away, but my card was blocked.&quot; Chen Qiang said he didn&#39;t know how long the payment stop would last. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Xueni also mentioned the anxiety after her bank card was stopped. She called the police and the bank where she opened her account many times to ask when the payment stop would be lifted, but the other party only said &quot;wait a little longer.&quot; Before the accident, she had borrowed a micro loan, and after the payment stopped, she could only borrow money to repay. Before she knew the exact time to unfreeze, she was very worried about not being able to repay the money she borrowed from friends. Wang Xueni did not tell her family that she had been cheated, and she had no money to use after the payment was stopped, so it was easy for her to reveal her secret. Because of this, she couldn&#39;t eat or sleep well. &quot;A protective stop payment is actually a punishment for the person who was defrauded. Let yourself remember this lesson.&quot; Wang Xueni said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zheng does not agree with the term &quot;lesson&quot;. She believes that she is a victim and being deceived is already a huge lesson. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On social media, there are many posts seeking relief from payment stoppages. Zhu Jingxian from Zhejiang was defrauded of 630,000 yuan due to her husband&#39;s negligence. After reporting the crime, her bank card was frozen for 48 hours. However, 25 days after the incident, the bank card was still protected from payment, and at the same time, various street police stations were called to inquire about the situation of being defrauded. After 35 days, his bank card was still unresolved. After explaining the situation to the public security bureau, he had to wait another 48 hours for a reply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;黎筝理解发帖的网友，她认为应该具体情况具体分析，已然醒悟的受害者可以提早解除止付，而非一刀切。 9月13日，招商派出所民警将黎筝名下所有信用卡解冻，同时将一张储蓄卡暂时解冻，让她先还上公司贷款。黎筝说，9月14日，福田派出所负责人向其告知，派出所内部针对此案做了讨论，认为其中存在警方内部信息交换不够通畅的问题，应该对市民诉求予以体恤，协助解决问题。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;这一切解释了他看到小说《装腔启示录》时的兴奋。 “合上书，我琢磨着，大概没人比我更擅长拍这个了。明确又委婉，虚伪又真挚，胆怯又勇敢。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;近日，改编自同名小说的电视剧《装腔启示录》播出，豆瓣评分8.1，成为他继《我在他乡挺好的》（2021，评分8.1）、《三悦有了新工作》（2022，评分8.4）之后第三部豆瓣评分8分以上的作品。对当下的国产电视剧导演而言，这个成绩足够亮眼。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;出生于1988年的李漠经历过类似的困境。大学毕业后，他弹琴、拍电影、写小说、当老师，还差点去考博士，说自己“什么都想要”。最终在导师的点拨下，他细看《心经》和《金刚经》，静下心来从宗教中获得启发，更笃定了心中的答案：“我就是想做表达的工作、做创作的工作，我可以去体验不一样的生活。”当导演是他目前的表达方式。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/MBhjCuHSJicaNAGq0yKfmTzIsjDx8iMtxu5Jiqj8.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;《装腔启示录》剧照&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李漠的微信名是Mephisto（梅菲斯托），微信签名是：“I can give you everything you want，but you just pay yourself.”（我能给你想要的一切，但你要付出灵魂。）它们来自德国作家约翰·沃尔夫冈·冯·歌德创作的诗剧《浮士德》。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;书中，浮士德垂垂老矣，在昏暗的书房里钻研半生，感到无比厌倦，这时恶魔梅菲斯托降临，引诱他签署了协议：满足他生前的所有要求，直到他死后拿走他的灵魂。这也是梅菲斯托与上帝的一个赌约。为追求真理，浮士德历尽艰险，走遍了人类追寻过的道路，经常失败和沉沦，但他没有放弃，最终获得了救赎。李漠很喜欢这部作品，看过很多遍，他觉得浮士德和梅菲斯托是人类的两面。 “人长大的过程中，灵魂好像越来越不重要。我把那句话写在我签名里，希望所有我认识的人看到能够想到这一点：如果它不那么重要，在你身上你都不探究它，那把你的灵魂卖掉好不好？浮士德在经历了一切之后，他发现灵魂最重要。这就是梅菲斯托的意义。我想要做一个梅菲斯托在身边的人，提醒大家、也提醒我，给你一切，把你灵魂卖掉好不好？”&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;李漠：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;原著里边那款停产了。很多修改都是希望它变得更接近当下。我预判到大家会对这些东西比较敏感，比如说剧开头许子诠在飞机上用的Le&amp;nbsp;Labo香膏，原著里面没有提到。那是我个人很喜欢的一款，我觉得很方便，随时拿着上飞机。后来我才知道那个也停产了，但是写剧本的时候还没停。我想把电视剧改得更接近我生活里的一些（实际情况），里面用的酒也是。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;道具怎么呈现是表达的一部分，这都不是带货，是我觉得他那样的人大约是用那样的东西。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;结局为什么要加上求婚的桥段？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;李漠：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;很多台词是书里延续下来的，只是求婚这个行为在书里面没有。因为剧结束了，我希望给观众一个结束的观感，是一个有仪式感的交代。他是求婚，不是结婚，我不觉得他俩就结婚了。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;求婚跟结婚差别还挺大的，求婚意味着自己的决心和意愿，我想跟你一直在一起。也没说白头偕老，说的是我想跟你构建属于我们的世界。我知道或许步入婚姻以后，我们会遇见很多困难，但我相信我和你有能力把生活过成我们想要的样子，这个是我想说的决心。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;唯心和唯物不矛盾，我心里这么想，我要有一点行动来证明，在我有财力的情况下，我买一个钻戒跟我的爱人表达。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在结局里放这么一场戏，就是想告诉观众许子诠是一个真诚的人。很多观众看他很帅，他屁股很翘，他有车有房，他是个金融男……于是就推论出这（求婚）一切不成立，这段爱情是个童话，他不可能这么喜欢一个三年级律师——长得也就那样。但爱情不是做买卖，爱上一个人没有道理，我就爱你。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;到最后求婚的时候，许子诠的爱情观是改变了的，他愿意跟唐影构建“我们的世界”，愿意把一个人的生活变成“我们俩的生活”，我觉得这就是求婚的价值和意义。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我愿意在我的戏里面去倡导正向表达我爱你，表达我愿意。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;这也是你的爱情观吗？这种正向的表达和相信？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;李漠：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我不停地去探寻爱情是什么，才能够比较相信它。我相信爱情是从遇见我老婆开始。许子诠有很大一部分是我的投射。他不觉得这世界上有这么一个人，可以支撑我，可以看到我最糟糕的地方还依旧爱我，能够包容我、理解我。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;唐影才是会谈恋爱、懂爱的人，许子诠懂的是撩拨、是技巧，他懂怎么招人喜欢。我最喜欢浴室里那场戏，许子诠非常糟糕的时候，唐影没有数落他的糟糕，而是告诉他：你应该告诉我你状态不好，你应该跟我分享，你应该把你不好的那面展露给我，你放心，我能接住，我觉得你是最好的，你都不知道你有多好。这是我人生中也经历过的一刻，让我觉得我在被人爱着、被人包裹着、支撑着。她让我觉得虽然我状态这么糟糕、我这么情绪波动、我事业面对低谷、我看不到未来，但她依旧不嫌弃我，没有以这些衡量我，没有谴责我。她告诉我：我爱你，你有多好你都不知道。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那一刻让我理解了什么是爱。原来爱不是索取，也不是付出，而是互相之间的给予，是能看到他最糟糕的那一面也依旧爱他。这个是我想跟大家讲的爱情观。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/RUmrzlT0NgeYRX9rp0B9x0P0HAmubDRtmCGSdJwj.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;李漠：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我觉得我想讲的圈层的人他们不配喊累，没有资格说自己辛苦。他们挣的钱比较多，在剧里的语境中，挣钱挣得比较多的人卖惨，这是不可以的。但真正接触到这些人的生活，他们有困境，他不可能跟别人说我累、我惨、我不愉快。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;你在CBD上班，你这么忙，你考上北大清华，你五院四系研究生毕业，你上了红圈所，你去了国投，你干到了中层，这人生已经很顶峰了，你还要怎样？你还惨什么？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他们最惨的地方就是他们没有资格说惨，他们上有老下有小，旁边有竞争对手，一步错就会被人扳倒，生活现状没有人看得到。人家觉得你活该，你应该的，你凭什么喊惨，我都吃不上饭了，我都没喊惨，你天天锦衣玉食，出入奢华的场合，你有什么好惨？所以我没法在这个戏里面替他们叫惨，我只能把他们的状态表现出来，疲惫感就是这种，他没法表达，他只能笑着跟人说，是，你说得对。这是我认识的这圈人给我的感受。当然我也不觉得他们惨。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我要讲这圈人，就得把这圈人身上最具特质的部分抓到，对我而言这部分就是这帮人都很累，很疲倦，但是他不能表达。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你拍的《我在他乡挺好的》《三悦有了新生活》《装腔启示录》口碑都不错，你希望表达的东西是什么？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;李漠：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;都是都市生活，都是讲都市年轻人的困境。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我也曾经在困境里，现在或许也在困境里。困境会帮助人成长，更好地磨练自己。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;剧里哪些困境是你最能共情的？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;李漠：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;是工作上的无力感。明明知道这件事能做好，也知道该怎么做好，但就是做不到。这种时候会觉得自己在这个城市里很渺小。不知道问题在哪，能做的都做了，事情还是这样。这是最能让我共情的都市人困境。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是我更希望告诉大家，面对这种困境别放弃。放弃是一种自我保护，因为不抱期待了，好像就不会失望，就不会受伤。无论是面对工作、爱情或是亲情，都在以一种退避的方式自我保护。我一个人也挺好，我不上去也挺好，我躺平也挺好，照样拿工资。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;可就算是这样也应该去尝试，失败有多可怕？失恋有多可怕？我有时候觉得失恋是一个挺快乐的事，可以感受到很多平时感受不到的情绪，多难能可贵的人生体验啊。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;你看所有我聊的这些都挺唯心的。物质层面也重要，但其实怎么都能活，也不用非要挣很多钱，主要是弄明白自己想要的生活水平，把今天的事儿干好就挺了不起。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你现在觉得自己已经走出这种困境了吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;李漠：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;很难走出，依旧会有无力感，哪怕是觉得比以前做的事多了，但是依旧有事情做不到。我工作时间越长，觉得这种无力感越重，很多事人能操控的部分很少。导演好像挺有权力的，能决定很多事，但今天下不下雨我决定不了，明天开不开会我决定不了。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当你察觉到无力的时候，是没找对跟这个世界相处的方式，一旦找到，就能感受到世界给你的支撑，而不是你跟这个世界的对立。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你什么时候开始感觉到世界给你的是助力而不是阻力？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;李漠：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;当我不跟世界死磕的时候。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;现在的社会结构带给人的无力感可能无法消解。现实就是我们努力也不一定会带来正向的回报，个人也无法仅靠努力就能实现命运的改变。你在表达中有没有思考过这样的现实？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;李漠：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我后面一个项目准备跟大家聊聊这个事，讲的是一个00后的年轻人，从小特别有抱负，考上了北京很好的大学，2019年入学，赶上了三年新冠疫情，毕业以后找不着工作。现在在写剧本，明年会拍这个项目。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我觉得现在是转变的时代，跟以前不一样。大家要接受转变。每一代人的人生中都会面对时代转变，比如社会波动、战争、变革，不用太恐慌。你说的在结构性的问题面前，人们需要去调整面对这个时代的目标和自我定位，不是说时代变了，努力也得不到和上个时代同样的结果，所以我不努力。这个时代努力有这个时代的结果，不努力连结果都没有。努力不是选择，努力是应该的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;或许我明年那个戏拍完了，也能给大家带来一些讨论，我想把究竟该怎么脚踏实地放到那个戏里跟大家讲。但我在这儿还是想跟大家说，不要放弃，你在这个时代躺平的时候，有一群不躺平的人就把机会夺走了。每一个时代都是这样，你放弃的机会会被别人拿走，你做努力的人你就有可能找到机会。积极面对人生，在任何时代里面都不是坏事。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 23:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[历经社会毒打为何屹立不倒？因为“男人至死是少年” ]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256898]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 22:00:36&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;“男人至死是少年”，这句话的传播之广众所周知，以至于我的耳膜时不时被震动一下。例如，多数男人一直保留着少年时期的爱好，比如游戏、玩具、运动、手艺活。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;更进一步，“男人至死是少年”，是一句充满了生活哲学的评语，它简直是为一群经历了社会的残酷毒打却能每每屹立于人世间的男人所“量身定做”的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位外国脱口秀演员在接受采访时表示，吃着披萨喝着酒，坐在电视机前看看球赛，骂骂裁判，就这样一个人度过愉快的时光，别提多幸福了。当被问一周看这么多球赛累不累时，他回答说：“一点也不累，因为我是那种头脑简单的男人，光是坐着看球赛就能获得快乐。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那么，“会跟妻子一起看球赛吗？”他的回答是：“不会，她心思比较复杂，很难专注做一件事，一些女人就是因为这样所以每天都觉得不开心。”有点吐槽自己老婆的意思。不过，有一个事实是不错的：男女偏好差异客观存在，很多时候，这种差异性也有喜感。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;知乎上一位男性答主说，他网购清单里有一堆想买但是深知毫无用处的东西，一根十几块钱的木棍子排在第二。棍子到手后，他给缠了手胶，带到了单位。女同事问他买这个干吗，他说就是想买，她表示很不理解。这意思似乎是说，十几元也是钱，拿来买把大葱也不浪费。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他就断言：“我就把棍子放这，你看哪个男的过来不玩一下？”结果这棍子一下午有六七人上手把玩，她看不懂，就给她老公发个照片，一会她老公回复：这棍好啊！&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;答主感慨，这根棍子从男孩几岁到几十岁通杀，而男的只要看到小时候玩的东西，立刻无缝衔接上手。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于这一点，我也有着切身的体会。我十三岁玩篆刻，用功颇多，虽然人到中年后有所松懈，但磨石头的爱好保留了下来。只要看到刻刀和印石，心中就会感到亲切，拿起石头磨一磨，从中体会到非功利的欢喜。不久前，我岳父母听了我的建议，为我在乡间的鸡圈里，置起“磨石台”，我常常把俗事收起，在此专心磨石。磨石时，鸡走虫鸣，风吹叶落，好生自在。那一刻，这种无一事相缠绕、不为五斗米奔忙的极致宁静，是迷人的、有魔性的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;说到底，很多男人之所以能至死都是少年，就在于一直体验着简单快乐的精髓。别说十几元的东西都能让他们快乐起来，就算不值钱的东西，例如，一根树枝，一块戈壁滩捡来的石头，都能让自己沉浸其中，把玩半天。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而真正的快乐，许多是不花钱的。一位毕业自北大的好友告诉我，他喜欢物理与数学，每次上网看看，就很开心。我的一位老领导，也喜欢每天深夜下了班，在单位坐一会，和网络上的围棋高手对弈片刻。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我注意过单位附近一个叫红庙的小街里的象棋客和观棋客，他们除了下大雨，都在街边旧桌子上下棋、看棋，随着棋局的变化，有时他们表情紧张“不敢高声语”，有时却轻快愉悦。我在此地十余年，因此细心留意过，下棋和看棋的始终就那几位。多年下来，他们除了面相显老，快乐的神情丝毫未变。那一盘棋局，关乎钱财？关乎名誉？关乎地位？并不是。他们只不过在“偷得浮生半日闲”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作家汪曾祺也写过一位做面鱼做得忘我精彩的老者的故事，赞其为“活庄子”。所谓的“活庄子”，要义不在“高深”，而在意象悠远、无拘无束吧。那些在寂静无人的河道边一坐就是一天的“钓友”，也是如此。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;绝大多数男人当然不可能绝然世外，名利之累也是有的。但是步入中老年岁月后，很多男人顿悟，既然工作与职级也就那样了，一辈子能到的高度也就那样了，得不到的就放手好了，留下一片素净天地让自己过得更简单、更纯真，岂非更好？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种考虑，是一种质朴品性的折射。当一个男人把个人荣辱、人生得失想透彻了之后，剩下的事就简单许多了。于是，从与自己的相处中得到乐趣，就成为一件每天要完成的课目。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与自己相处，某种意义上是难度最大的。如果一个人总是心怀不切实际的目标，总是和自己较劲；那么，这种自处的质量就会很糟糕，人格还容易撕裂。当然，如果一个人出于攀比心，总是（对配偶）心怀不切实际的目标，使劲催逼自己的配偶“努力”，去挣更多的钱、要有权，那么这种相处的质量就会很糟糕，家庭也很难和睦。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;反过来，如果一个人能意识到人生的某个阶段并不是追求到什么才是快乐，能保持一份平常心，就很容易让自己的“影子”也被自己营造的天趣所感染，从而真正融合在一起，让自己变得更强大，更从容。如果家人比较理解或也是这样的人，家庭就会比较融洽和睦。这种自在、放松、忘我、乐在其中，与消费主义助推的、极易带来痛苦的攀比，很不一样。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;人不免受到欲望袭扰，但人还是要努力做到与自己的相处达到平衡之境。童心未泯，是一个很平易却是至高的境界。它的基础是刚健的秉性、快乐的真谛。说到底，很多男人对于“简单快乐”的尊崇，代表了一个群体对于自身价值的客观评价和对“世外”的不卑不亢之态度，它延续着个体的童心，也让世俗生活多了几分恬淡的意趣。这就是“至死是少年”所暗藏的男人的秘密。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;
