The previous &quot;Ghost Trilogy&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;The Abode of the Heart&quot;, &quot;Ghost&quot; and &quot;Yela&quot;&lt;/span>;) and &quot;Immigration Trilogy&quot; &quot;Music&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Barbara&quot;, &quot;Phoenix&quot; and &quot;Transit&quot;&lt;/span>;), which has earned him a good reputation in the international film industry . So he struck while the iron was hot and continued to launch a series of works with the theme of &quot;Elemental Elves&quot;. &quot;Undine&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;2020&lt;/span>;) with the theme of the water goddess is the first film in the series; it won the jury award at the 2023 Berlin Film Festival The grand prize of the group, &quot;Red Sky&quot; with the theme of the fire elf Salomanda, is the second installment in this series. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By sorting out Petzold’s creative trajectory, we can find some obvious characteristics. His works are highly intellectual, and he will provide almost essay-like explanations around certain specific themes. At the same time, he places great emphasis on the core position occupied by concepts. Under the guidance of such creative concepts, the fate of classical mythological characters overlaps with the situation of modern Germans (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;&quot;Phoenix&quot;&lt;/span>;), the plight of the Jews during World War II also collided with the fate of Arab refugees in contemporary Europe (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;&quot;Transit&quot;&lt;/span>;), stirring up a wonderful chemical reaction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But we also have to point out that although the concept of Petzold&#39;s film is charming, it is slightly rigid in terms of flesh and texture, and lacks some real and perceptible vitality. This problem is particularly exposed in Undine: an attempt to combine a water spirit from classical mythology with the life of a contemporary German industrial diver, which is very interesting on paper, but fails to translate into images In the end, it is easy to fall into the predicament of wildly swinging between the metaphysical and the physical, and end up relying on neither. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Petzold must have realized his mistake in Undine. Therefore, when filming his new work &quot;Red Sky&quot;, he sought a lighter brushstroke: the metaphysical mythological elements are hidden deeper, while the metaphysical daily life is pushed to the foreground. The plot is set during a summer vacation. Leon, a troubled young writer, is invited to his friend Felix&#39;s seaside holiday home to try to finish the novel in a quiet environment while waiting for the publisher&#39;s decision. But during this period of time that should have calmed him down, he passively got acquainted with the beautiful and lively girl Nadia, and her lover Devi who had a close relationship with her. Leon&#39;s heart was stirred up, but the approaching deadline (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Deadline&lt;/span>;) and the burden of intellectuals made him Nadia&#39;s emotions become tangled and twisted, creating a series of comedies and dramas in the lives of four people. At the same time, a wildfire is spreading inland, becoming the disturbing background sound of the entire story. No one knows whether this light vacation will eventually end in raging flames. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like the titles of many of Petzold&#39;s previous films, &quot;Red Sky&quot; is also full of potential. It not only refers to the sky dyed red by wildfires on a concrete level, but also metaphorically alludes to the sexual tension that is about to emerge between the several protagonists, as well as the overwhelming sexual tension in the &quot;Revelation&quot; volume of the New Testament. Apocalyptic scene. But the film&#39;s story ultimately fails to live up to the full potential of its title. The huge destructive power of wildfires is almost wiped out by a shot of wild boars running in the forest and the off-screen deaths of two supporting characters; and &quot;Memento mori&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;will die&lt;/span>;)-style death warning also fails to be integrated with the character&#39;s desires. In the final analysis, &quot;Red Sky&quot; still tells the story of a self-centered male protagonist chasing the heroine and awakening during the pursuit. Whether it is his friends, publishers, the fire and death, or even the heroine herself, they seem to be tools that lead him to self-awakening. And there remains a huge gulf between Petzold&#39;s prowess in seductive concept-building and what can only be described as a barely above-average narrative articulation. Red Skies is an improvement over its predecessor, but there&#39;s a gap that still needs to be filled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/Zh1Vsz896cTN46UvPe0CjDwWeYJydBhnwEzqf2Qb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;679&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/Zh1Vsz896cTN46UvPe0CjDwWeYJydBhnwEzqf2Qb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250590&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Hide And the master of melodrama&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Compared with his meek performance in narrative and expression, Petzold&#39;s ability to write romantic relationships and set off the love atmosphere is outstanding. It is easy to forget that Germans have always been famous for their seriousness, whether they are romantic poets like Goethe and Holderlin or melodrama masters like Douglas Sirk and Rainer Werner Fassbinder. He grew up nourished by the Rhine River. To a certain extent, Petzold is also the heir to the romantic mantle of his predecessors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the valuable thing about Petzold is that his writing about love relationships not only has a German-style desperate romance, but also has a subtle temperament that is rare among European and American creators. Petzold&#39;s male protagonists always seem to be more interested in the souls of their admirers than in possessing their bodies, but they are always so shy and clumsy in their pursuit of each other that The end of happiness seems forever out of reach. In contrast, Petzold&#39;s heroines are always as erratic as wandering spirits, unable to be defined or captured. They are free souls who make no secret of their feelings for the person they love, but they always refuse to be defined as immutable symbols and never become objects. Therefore, in Petzold&#39;s film, the dislocation game of chasing and dodging has been going on. This game seems to have been going on since the birth of men and women, and it will continue until the end of the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Red Sky&quot;, the setting of summer vacation and country holiday house, the lighter tone compared with Petzold&#39;s previous works, and the characters&#39; artistic and intellectual atmosphere The conversation will more or less remind us of those in Eric Rohmer&#39;s films, those satirical ridicules of hesitant straight men with good intentions, and those under the comedic tone, which are emotionless and emotionless. perspective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But on the other hand, Petzold’s talent for creating romantic situations, his intense love for female characters, and the emotional relationships between male and female characters in his films become more intense because of evasion and restraint. , will remind people of another film master who is good at creating romantic atmosphere-Wong Kar-wai. Perhaps Paula Bell, the actress in &quot;Transit&quot;, &quot;Undine&quot; and &quot;Red Sky&quot;, has quietly become Petzold&#39;s Maggie Cheung. The plots of these movies may soon disappear from our minds, but Paula Bell&#39;s bright smile and red dress will remain in our memories for a long time. Through the male director&#39;s way, we cannot fully understand what they mean. Thoughts and feelings, but still (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;or - precisely because of this&lt;/span>;) eyes full of admiration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[餐厅员工发顾客打娃视频后赔1万离职，警方如此调解令人费解]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257400]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;According to reports, on September 19, a Western restaurant stopped a mother from beating her daughter and posted the relevant video online. The employee, Mr. Jiang, resigned and left Changsha after compensating the other party 10,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The surveillance video that Mr. Jiang previously posted online showed that the woman involved, Hu, was holding a shopping bag and yelling at the little girl. Later, she took her child to the Western restaurant where Mr. Jiang worked and asked her child to explain to her the process of causing trouble. At this moment, Hu lost control. He put down the shopping bag in his hand, lifted the chair next to him and tried to hit the girl. Mr. Jiang and his colleagues stepped forward to stop him. A nearby merchant revealed in an interview with a reporter from Hunan TV that when the mother and daughter passed by his store, the girl suddenly fell down and the ice cream in her hand spilled on the floor, causing her clothes to be stained. Immediately, Hu lost control of his emotions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Jiang said that after the incident, Hu came to the restaurant many times, saying that he should not have spread the video online and threatened to die in the restaurant. After mediation by the local police station, Mr. Jiang paid the other party 10,000 yuan in compensation for mental losses and medical expenses, and then voluntarily submitted his resignation to his boss. Netizens expressed: &quot;Those who hit people are fine, but those who stopped them will be punished&quot;, &quot;I really feel sorry for this doll when I see this video&quot;, and some netizens said, &quot;It&#39;s really chilling.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The restaurant employee got into trouble when he prevented the woman Hu from beating her daughter in public and uploading the video to the Internet. This matter involves many aspects, including domestic violence, public supervision, privacy rights and law enforcement issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, it must be clear that Hu’s behavior of beating his daughter in public is a typical act of domestic violence. It not only violates public order and good customs, but also violates relevant laws. According to Article 2 of the Anti-Domestic Violence Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China, domestic violence refers to physical, mental and other violations committed by family members in the form of beating, binding, mutilation, restriction of personal freedom, regular verbal abuse, and intimidation. Article 5 stipulates that minors, the elderly, disabled people, pregnant and lactating women, and seriously ill patients who suffer domestic violence shall be given special protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is the duty of the police station to deal with Hu’s illegal behavior as soon as possible. Article 33 of the Anti-Domestic Violence Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China stipulates that if the perpetrator commits domestic violence and constitutes a violation of public security management, he shall be subject to public security management penalties in accordance with the law. It can be seen that when parents beat their children, law enforcement agencies cannot turn a blind eye on the grounds that &quot;honest officials cannot handle household matters.&quot; In this incident, Hu publicly beat his daughter, which caused a very bad public perception. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the restaurant employee Mr. Jiang’s behavior of publishing the video, from a legal perspective, he did not infringe on Hu’s portrait rights. Because this is an exposure of illegal activities in public places, Mr. Jiang is exercising the citizen’s right to supervise. Article 1020 of the Civil Code stipulates that the following acts may be reasonably carried out without the consent of the portrait right holder: other acts of making, using, or disclosing the portrait of the portrait right holder in order to safeguard public interests or the legitimate rights and interests of the portrait right holder. By exposing his video, Mr. Jiang obviously hopes to draw social attention to the phenomenon of domestic violence and jointly protect the rights of minors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taking a step back, even if Hu believes that his rights and interests have been violated, he should protect his rights and interests through legal means such as litigation, rather than through improper means such as making trouble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu made trouble in the restaurant many times. However, the police station did not hold him accountable. Instead, through mediation, Mr. Jiang was asked to compensate 10,000 yuan for mental damages and medical expenses. This move not only chilled Mr. Jiang&#39;s heart, but also sent a wrong signal: If illegal acts can be resolved through mediation, or even reverse compensation can be obtained, wouldn&#39;t it condone more people&#39;s willful behavior? In this way, the law loses its majesty and justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a law enforcement agency, it should be based on the law, focus on protecting the rights and interests of minors and the courageous behavior of citizens, and have zero tolerance for illegal activities, so as to form a legal deterrent and guide social atmosphere. Improve the quality of citizens through legal education. Regrettably, the police station allowed the parties’ emotions to influence the outcome of the case, acquiescing to the woman’s behavior of “getting more and more unreasonable”. Such mediation is inconsistent with legal principles. Netizens generally questioned this mediation and expressed their simple view of justice. Law enforcement agencies should re-investigate the matter and hold the offenders accountable, rather than letting those who bravely act for justice lose money and jobs. Only in this way can people&#39;s faith in judicial authority not be damaged. After all, the majesty and credibility of the law are often reflected in the daily actions of law enforcers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti , Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[如果你导弹打得不够准，是因为你人靠得不够近丨军事]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257374]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/20/gup4AaFCsszUqfElPfxsoCHZgB5ey11TUdvQehIu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/gup4AaFCsszUqfElPfxsoCHZgB5ey11TUdv QehIu. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251331&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;September 13, 2023, Sevastopol, Crimea region, Smoke billowed out from the attacked shipyard &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, Ukrainian news said that the Ukrainian military In the early morning of September 13, 2023, 10 missiles and 3 unmanned boats launched an attack on the Sevastopol military base in the Crimean Peninsula, causing a fire at the Sevastopol Shipyard and two ships under repair were damaged. The losses include the Russian Black Sea Fleet&#39;s Ropcha-class landing ship &quot;Minsk&quot; and the Kilo-class diesel-powered submarine &quot;Rostov-on-Don&quot; which cost up to US$300 million and was commissioned in 2014. Rostov-on-Don). Satellite images of the scene showed that the two ships were severely damaged and were extremely difficult and expensive to repair. Considering that such a project was difficult to complete under the wartime system, they basically had to be scrapped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Russia also admitted that it was attacked by Ukrainian missiles and that some ships were damaged. The situation announced by both sides basically confirmed the results of this attack. This is the largest loss suffered by the Black Sea Fleet since the sinking of the flagship Moskva after the war between Russia and Ukraine. It also sets a record for the first time in history that a submarine is hit by a missile. What’s even more amazing is that just two days after this attack, Ukraine announced that it had used missiles and drones to attack the S-400 air defense missile system on the Crimean Peninsula. This system has always been considered the strongest in Russia. Currently in active air defense weapons, Turkey even had tense relations with the United States and NATO in order to purchase this system. This time, it was beheaded by Ukraine behind enemy lines in actual combat, which was shocking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This round of continuous attacks with a combination of punches is obviously not the result of an accident, but a joint military operation between the Ukrainian intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense, in which the actions of the Ukrainian special forces can be said to be indispensable. without. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two days before launching the missile attack, that is, on September 11, the Ukrainian intelligence agency announced that the special forces had successfully seized two offshore oil and gas drilling platforms in the Black Sea and successfully removed Russian equipment from the platforms. military installations. The map shows that the two platforms captured by the Ukrainian special forces are about fifty kilometers away from the Crimean coastline. The Russian army has set up air and sea warning radars on them to control the Black Sea area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This attack did not attract much attention from domestic public opinion. Some media even believed that it was a political show after Ukraine’s counterattack failed, because the battle to seize the two platforms was not fierce and not too big. military value. However, in my opinion, the battle to seize the sea platform is the prelude to this attack, because Ukraine does not have stealth fighter equipment that can penetrate the enemy&#39;s air defense network, so it must try to shorten the reaction time of the opponent&#39;s air defense weapons, and these two This platform happens to be Russia&#39;s peripheral observation point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the start of the 2003 Iraq War, the U.S. military used special forces to successfully seize three Iraqi offshore drilling platforms in the Persian Gulf. On the other hand, it is to prevent Iraq from dumping oil into the Persian Gulf and polluting the environment like it did during the Gulf War. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the operation that year, in addition to the British and American special forces, the Polish Thunder Special Task Force also assumed the offensive mission of a platform. This kind of battle to seize maritime platforms is referred to as VBSS (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Visit, board, search and seize&lt;/span>;) in the field of special operations. VBSS The mission is often only accomplished by elite maritime special operations units. The complexity of such operations lies in the fact that it involves combat maneuvers from underwater to the surface, and also includes extremely close indoor combat. It not only requires a large amount of pre-war reconnaissance, but also requires a large amount of targeted actual combat training by operational units before they can make up their minds to implement it. This kind of maritime point-taking operation generally cannot be just a political statement mission, because the risks and costs are too high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen from the missile attack two days later that Ukraine&#39;s action to seize the Black Sea drilling platform is only part of its huge action plan. In fact, the follow-up actions are the key to victory. After the submarine and landing ship were attacked by missiles, Ukraine launched a missile attack one day later. The battle rhythm seemed not compact enough. But in fact, the U.S. special forces did not delay after seizing the platform. Another attack team quietly landed on the Crimean Peninsula under the cover of night, approached the submarines and landing ships in the shipyard, and used thermal imaging Shoot it from multiple angles. After the attack, these latent special operations personnel conducted reconnaissance and assessment of the bombing effects before quietly withdrawing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because air-launched missile attacks involve issues with the angle of incidence, it is necessary to construct a three-dimensional image of the target, and the inspection needs to confirm its radar information or thermal imaging information, all of which require multi-angle technical reconnaissance. The United States may be able to rely on its powerful satellite and reconnaissance aircraft platforms for reconnaissance. For Ukraine, which lacks technical reconnaissance means, using special forces or covert operators to conduct close reconnaissance is a good alternative. And even for a country like the United States with strong technical reconnaissance capabilities, close-in reconnaissance by special forces is still one of the optional methods. For example, during the Gulf War, the United States sent multiple special operations teams into Iraq in order to find Iraqi Scud missiles. Conduct close reconnaissance from the rear. In addition, for collecting the signal characteristics of enemy air defense weapons, deploying special operations personnel for close detection is also a very feasible method, because with only a set of signal receivers, these lurking personnel can obtain the spectrum information of surrounding warning radars for a long time , and can also obtain more comprehensive signal intelligence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people believe that the emergence of drones can replace special operations personnel, but in fact it is people, not machines, who win wars. Only when the quality of people matches technical means can we defeat powerful opponents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 20:26:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[10人遇难，强龙卷风突袭江苏后，救灾与保险赔付正进行]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257406]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/22/d0f40bac84.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/22/d0f40bac84. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251665&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 20, the scene of the tornado disaster in Nancai Township, Suqian City.

Luo Qi saw that on South Street, electric wires were blazing and cars were on fire. There is a small market on the street every day, right in front of Luo Qi&#39;s house. One of the sheds in front of her house was blown away and disappeared, and the other one was tied to a tree with a rope, but it hit the freezer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Luo Qi checked the surveillance video at home and found that the three minutes before the tornado struck were unusually calm, with only light rain falling. Starting at 17:11, the surveillance video recorded a loud wind noise, and the shed at the door was blown. Then the wind became louder and louder, a red four-corner tent floated by the roadside, the big box was blown away, and all the small objects on the ground began to fly everywhere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Luo Qi said that the child&#39;s grandmother was washing vegetables at the door. When she saw something was wrong and wanted to go back into the house, the tricycle was blown up by the wind and pushed against the wall. The car window glass penetrated her elbows and feet, and she went to the hospital that night for stitches. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The stall owner next to Luo Qi’s house was not so lucky. He was picked up by the wind and fell to the other side of the road. At that time, a wrist-thick main cable suddenly fell down on the street, bursting into flames, and everyone was afraid of being electrocuted. &quot;I was so frightened at that moment.&quot; Luo Qi said that it was the first time in more than 30 years that she had seen such a violent tornado. The stall owner&#39;s wife kept asking for help, but no one dared to rescue her. Later, the police cordoned off the scene, and the cables were still on fire after the power was artificially cut off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On Liyuan Road, which intersects with South Street, Li Peng opened a small supermarket. In his memory, the tornado lasted no more than a few minutes. But in those few minutes, the tornado tore off almost all the roofs on both sides of the street. &quot;Those asbestos tiles and sheds were hanging in the sky, as high as an airplane, blowing everywhere.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Peng’s home is a 16-year-old tile-roofed house. Since the house has never had any problems before, Li Peng has not reinforced or renovated the house. The tile-roofed house suffered heavy losses in this tornado. The roof kept leaking and the furniture and doors inside were smashed. &quot;I haven&#39;t calculated the amount of damage. I can only make detailed statistics when repairs start.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the tornado moved all the way to Daxing Town, it was already around 6 o&#39;clock. Fante, a 14-year-old girl, just came home from school. She saw a black thing slowly rolling up from a distance. &quot;It seemed to be connected to the sky, very long.&quot; During dinner, the lights at home flickered on and off, and soon the power went out. A strong wind blew into Fanter&#39;s house. Grandma went to block the two glass doors, but she couldn&#39;t close them. Fanter ran to help, &quot;but there was a strong suction that sucked me to the door and blew me into the tree.&quot; Fanter, who weighed 85 pounds, hugged the big tree outside the door and did not dare to move. He did not come down along the trunk until the wind stopped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to &quot;Jiangsu Weather&quot; news on September 20, Jiangsu was affected by two tornadoes on September 19. The first tornado was in Suqian Economic Development Zone and Daxing Town from 17:00 to 18:00; the other was in Funing County, Yancheng City from 20:16 to 35:00. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the official public account of the Suqian Emergency Management Bureau, the tornado disaster mainly occurred in towns and villages, with densely populated areas, complex building structures, and the occurrence period coincided with off-duty hours. According to preliminary statistics, 5,512 people were affected by the strong tornado, 1,646 houses were generally damaged, 137 houses collapsed, 41.8 hectares of crops were damaged, 405 people were temporarily relocated, and some walls of more than 2,000 square meters of pig houses collapsed and the roof collapsed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/22/9a3ba8adc3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/22/9a3ba8adc3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251666&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On the roadside in Nancai Township, electric workers are repairing lines. Visual China Picture &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Public housing insurance is verifying compensation&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Sun Wei, assistant captain of Suqian Blue Sky Rescue Team, told Southern Weekend Reporter, a common disaster in Suqian is heavy rain. Relatively speaking, tornadoes occur more frequently in Yancheng City. The private rescue teams along the Jiangsu coast have conducted targeted training on thunderstorms and hurricanes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At around 6 pm on the 19th, 13 members of the Blue Sky Rescue Team rushed to Nancai Township, Economic Development Zone. The local fire rescue team had arrived at the scene. The Blue Sky Team members assisted in clearing down fallen trees and scattered debris. etc., to open up a smooth road; at the same time, we checked the power supply lines to prevent secondary disasters such as leakage. &quot;We continued working until two o&#39;clock in the morning the next day.&quot; Road cleanup in Nancai Township was basically completed on the 20th. Suqian Blue Sky Rescue Team sent 12 reinforcements to Daxing Town in the afternoon to investigate the disaster situation, mainly assisting township staff to verify whether there were any people who had lost contact after the disaster. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Wei said that after the tornado passes through, another task is to clean up the debris on the facade of the building. For example, the air conditioner on the edge of the eaves was blown to the outside of the bracket and needs to be adjusted. The severely damaged roof There are broken tiles on the floor, which should be cleaned as soon as possible. &quot;Prevent the heavy rain after the tornado from falling down the originally skewed items, causing secondary disasters.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Chen Jianqiang and his wife, residents of North Street in Daxing Town, the main problem is that after the roof tiles are broken, How to fall asleep at night. Daughter Chen Guo said that the roof of her parents&#39; house had just been renovated a few days ago, and they spent three to four thousand yuan to replace it with new tiles. Unexpectedly, the tornado ripped through most of the roof, and the electrical appliances in the house were also soaked in rain all night. Fortunately, the corridor was made of hard cement boards, so the two old men laid several layers of quilts on the corridor and spent the night. On September 20, my uncle, who was in his seventies, came to help repair the roof. I didn’t know when it would be repaired. Someone from the village registered the loss of the house, but the old man didn&#39;t know how to subsidize it in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of September 20, the Suqian Emergency Management Bureau issued a WeChat article stating that it had insured urban and rural residents of Suqian City with public safety urban and rural assistance insurance, which would cover urban and rural housing in Suqian City due to floods and typhoons. Compensation for house losses caused by natural disasters such as landslides, landslides, fires and explosions. The compensation standard is that for urban housing, the main structure insurance amount is 180,000 yuan/household, and the interior decoration insurance amount is 120,000 yuan/household; for rural housing, the main structure insurance amount is 180,000 yuan/household, and the interior decoration insurance amount is 40,000 yuan/household. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The underwriter of this project is mainly the Suqian Branch of the People&#39;s Insurance Company of China Co., Ltd. Zheng Xinbo, the company&#39;s contact person, told Southern Weekend reporters that this private housing insurance is purchased by the government, and each household pays 2 yuan. , have been purchasing continuously for many years. After the disaster occurred, they sent more than 30 staff to the villages and towns on the 20th to verify the damage and determine the damage. The first batch of compensation will be completed before the National Day holiday. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relatively speaking, Yancheng City has more experience in dealing with tornadoes. Public information shows that on June 23, 2012, Yancheng &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;>;City&lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;file://item/%E9%98%9C%E5% AE%81/871643%3ffromModule=lemma_inlink&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; text-decoration: none;&quot;>;Funing&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; text -decoration: none;&quot;>;,&lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;file://item/%E5%B0%84%E9%98%B3/871862%3ffromModule=lemma_inlink&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; text-decoration: none;&quot;>;Sheyang&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;An EF4 tornado occurred in some areas, with winds exceeding level 17. 99 people were killed and 846 injured. The local government built the Yancheng Memorial Hall for Fighting the &quot;6.23&quot; Tornado. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Funing County Party Committee Propaganda Department stated that Funing County has also formulated corresponding emergency plans for natural disasters that occur more frequently. After the tornado, the &quot;9.19&quot; Typhoon Emergency Rescue Command was established in the affected town as soon as possible; special teams were arranged to go to each disaster-stricken village to find out the situation, grasp the disaster situation as soon as possible and report it quickly. Four rounds of sifting search and rescue operations were carried out overnight on September 19. In addition, 129 disaster-stricken people were urgently relocated and resettled by staying with relatives and friends, staying in hotels, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jiangsu is a tornado-prone area in the country. According to &quot;Jiangsu Meteorology&quot; news, from 1956 to 2015, a total of 109 tornadoes occurred in Jiangsu, with the highest proportion occurring in summer, reaching 79.8%, with an annual average of 1.5. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why Jiangsu is prone to tornadoes is that the province has a flat terrain, dense rivers and lakes, and is located in the north-south climate transition zone. Cold and warm air currents frequently meet, which can easily form strong convective weather including tornadoes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meteorological experts in the above article said that Jiangsu is usually less prone to tornadoes in mid-to-late September, but recently due to higher temperatures and the influence of the Jianghuai cyclone, relatively strong tornadoes have occurred. dynamic conditions. Against this background, a relatively rare tornado event occurred in Jiangsu on September 19. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the 21st, Wang Xiaohua, deputy director of the Jiangsu Provincial Meteorological Observatory, said in an interview with CCTV that the Jiangsu Provincial Meteorological Observatory has built a strong convection and strong wind demonstration system from 2021 to 2023. , some preliminary forecast and warning capabilities of tornadoes. In the next step, the meteorological department will use multi-source observation data such as multi-band radar collaborative observation to improve and optimize tornado early warning technology and indicators based on the characteristics of climate change, and further improve forecast and early warning capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Local residents are pseudonyms in the article)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[白切鸡寿司走红，年轻人流行的“中餐日作”是真香吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257296]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 17:30:15&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 17:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[钱锺书回避鲁迅？No，他开启了“悄悄关注”模式]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257339]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/22/Al0NA8piZmtUhLaOo6f35jIRv7oOmF4B0asgnIe8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;732&quot; height=&quot;487&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/22/Al0NA8piZmtUhLaOo6f35jIRv7oOmF4B 0asgnIe8. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251595&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;From left: Lin Yutang, Lu Xun, Soong Ching Ling, Smedley, Li Peihua (Secretary of Soong Ching Ling) ). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Qian Zhongshu rarely talked about Lu Xun publicly, he could not &quot;avoid&quot; Lu Xun. Crystal once said in &quot;Miscellaneous Notes of Shi Qian&#39;s Throwing Books&quot; that at a symposium, Qian Zhongshu praised Lu Xun&#39;s short stories for being well written, but not suitable for long stories. The most well-known person is Qian Zhongshu&#39;s opening speech at the &quot;Lu Xun and Chinese and Foreign Culture&quot; academic seminar. This article was later published in &quot;Literary Journal&quot; on October 23, 1986, and collected in &quot;The Edge of Life&quot;. In his opening speech, Qian Zhongshu said a few words &quot;as usual&quot; based on people&#39;s &quot;public opinions&quot; on Lu Xun at that time: &quot;Lu Xun was a great man. The greater the figure, the more aspects can be observed; &#39;Chinese and foreign culture&#39; is a big The bigger the topic, the wider the scope of the problems that can occur.&quot; The main spirit of his speech was to hope that everyone can &quot;speak freely without bending the meaning to seek common ground&quot;, and could not see the true evaluation of Lu Xun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Qian Zhongshu and Lu Xun also had a period of time in the same city. In September 1927, Lu Xun left Guangzhou and lived in Shanghai until his death in October 1936. Qian Zhongshu graduated from Tsinghua University in the summer of 1933 and taught at Guanghua University. He began studying at Oxford in the autumn of 1935, so he spent more than two years in Shanghai. However, they were only from the same city, and the two of them had never been seen crossing paths. However, as a later scholar and because of Lu Xun&#39;s huge influence, Qian Zhongshu inevitably had to &quot;encounter&quot; Lu Xun intentionally or unintentionally when writing.刘玉凯所著《鲁迅钱锺书平行研究论》、隋清娥所著《鲁迅钱锺书文学比较论》等，均从学术层面作过比较，谢泳、王培军、李国涛、钱之俊等学者在著述中也时有阐发，兹从钱锺书著作中发掘数例与鲁迅相关者，或可补阙。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《围城》里，孙柔嘉的姑父姑母在一家大纱厂里任要职，一向瞧不起方鸿渐。有一次，方鸿渐与孙柔嘉又因姑母的到来而吵架，当得知其姑母想在厂里给自己找个职位时，他便跳起来大喝道：“谁要她替我找事？我讨饭也不要向她讨！她养了Bobby跟你孙柔嘉两条走狗还不够么？你对她说，方鸿渐&#39;本领虽没有，脾气很大&#39;，资本家走狗的走狗是不做的。”此段文字，立刻会让人想起鲁迅1930年发表的名篇《“丧家的”“资本家的乏走狗”》，文章是批梁实秋的。钱锺书当时虽在清华读书，鲁梁论战的文章，他一定不会错过。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;商务印书馆《容安馆札记》第一册第八十四则，读岳珂《桯史》笔记，钱锺书摘抄卷十二以下一段文字并加按语：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;金国熙宗（完颜）亶，皇统十年夏，龙见（现）御寨宫中，雷雨大至，破柱而去。亶大惊，以为不祥，欲厌禳之。左右或以为当肆赦（大赦），遂召当制学士张钧视草（起草诏书）。其中有“顾兹寡昧”及“眇予小子”之言，译者不晓其退托谦冲之义，乃曰：“汉儿强知识，托文字以詈我主上耳。”亶惊问故，译释其义曰：“寡者，孤独无亲；昧者，不晓人事；眇为瞎眼；小子为小孩儿。”亶大怒，亟召钧至，诘其说，未及对，以手剑剺(割)其口，棘而醢之。竟不知译之为愚为奸也。云云……按此鲁迅直译之祖也。 ”（《容安馆札记》第146页）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;金熙宗完颜亶是金朝第三位皇帝，据说他即位前曾受学于韩昉，能用汉文赋诗，即位后，尤勤于学习汉文典籍。而据《桯史》此条所记，完颜亶似乎不甚精通汉文，且译者也只会“直译”，断章取义地把诏谕中帝王常用套语如“顾兹寡昧”和“眇予小子”，“直解”为詈骂主上，遂失却原有的“退托谦冲”之义，而致张钧获罪。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;钱锺书的按语“此鲁迅直译之祖也”，自然又令人联想到“鲁梁之争”。梁实秋于1929年9月曾在《新月》上发表了《论鲁迅先生的“硬译”》，鲁迅于次年3月在《萌芽月刊》发表《“硬译”与“文学的阶级性”》予以反驳，论争已超出翻译界限。就翻译来说，鲁迅所倡“直译”（或“硬译”），如翻译《苦闷的象征》，“是按板规逐句，甚而至于逐字译的”，其宗旨是“宁信而不顺”。钱锺书显然是熟悉翻译界这场论战的，但他与鲁迅的观点不同，于是钱锺书接着写道：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;余读《说文》至“口”部第二十六字“囮：译也”，尝叹洨长（编者注：指许慎）真圣人，预知Tradutore,traditore！王元之《小畜集》卷十四《译对》云：“译，易也，大能易心，小则易其语而已。 ”云云。解放以后，译书之风益盛，不知妄作，活剥生吞，不特面目全非，抑且心肝尽换，洵元之所谓“大译”者也。辜汤生《张文襄幕府纪闻》卷下云：“陈兰彬使美，随员徐某，不谙西文，一日忽持西报，似读之津津有味者，同僚怪而问之，徐曰：读西报不解，读诸君翻译亦不解。等不解也，不若径读西报之为愈矣。 ”云云，此与张钧事，皆可作今译才座右铭也。（同上第146-147页）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此条札记联系“解放以后”译界“不知妄作，活剥生吞”而谈，也是对“直译”的否定。关于翻译，钱锺书所追求的是“化”境，虽然“彻底和全部的&#39;化&#39;是不可实现的理想”。故而钱锺书在文中盛赞许慎（洨长）为“真圣人”，说他能预知翻译是“囮”（讹），翻译家（Tradutore）即叛徒（traditore），详见《林纾的翻译》和《管锥编》中若干论述。此条下文又以辜鸿铭笔下徐某读西报故实，与张钧事合观，认为“皆可作今译才座右铭也”，风趣之中不失讽刺，颇见钱锺书行文一贯风格。而整篇笔记醒目之处在按语“直译之祖”云云，点到即止。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;二十世纪二三十年代，林语堂为改变“中国式幽默”的玩笑态度，以重塑君子之德，故而提倡“幽默文学”。不料事与愿违，如钱锺书在其散文《说笑》中所批评的一样：“自从幽默文学提倡以来，卖笑变成了文人的职业。 ”林语堂因救“时弊”而助“时弊”，“幽默文学”的实际效应与其初衷背道而驰，钱锺书的《说笑》即是针对“幽默文学”有感而发。而对于林语堂的主张，鲁迅在《一思而行》里就曾批评过：“轰的一声，天下无不幽默和小品。 ”（《鲁迅全集》第5卷第473页）又在《“滑稽”例释》里指出，幽默文学不过是给“油滑，轻薄，猥亵”蒙上“&#39;幽默&#39;之号”（《鲁迅全集》第5卷第342页）。有人因此认为，“在对提倡幽默文学的看法上，鲁迅和钱锺书真是前呼后应”（李钦业《读&amp;lt;写在人生边上&amp;gt;》），此说似是而非。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在现代文学史上，鲁迅、林语堂和钱锺书都以幽默见长。鲁迅的幽默似匕首，带有手术刀切除病瘤般的锋芒，而林语堂的幽默是轻风，如心灵的净化剂。在当时，林语堂的幽默文学自然不及鲁迅杂文的力量，因而显得不合时宜，受到鲁迅的公开批评。钱锺书的幽默似寒雨扑面，冷中带刺，有如伪装者的灵魂被揭穿后的尴尬与不安。可是，钱锺书虽然也批评林语堂，若拿他的《说笑》与林语堂的《论幽默》相比，却会发现他们的幽默观何其相似：钱锺书说，一个真有幽默的人对于幽默“别有会心”，林语堂说，一位冷静超远的旁观者对于幽默将发出“会心的微笑”；钱锺书说，幽默是“滑稽多智”，林语堂说，“智慧已启”“遂有幽默”；钱锺书说，幽默是“替沉闷的人生透一口气”，林语堂说，幽默是“人生之一部分”。幽默源于智慧，幽默名家钱锺书与林语堂的观念相近而表现与效果不同，不足奇怪。因幽默观如是，林语堂提倡幽默文学以涵养国人的幽默感，培养有教养的国民，而钱锺书认为真正的幽默是能“反躬自笑”的，一经提倡即成笑柄，所以他说：“幽默至多是一种脾气，决不能标为主张，更不能当作职业。 ”由此可见，钱锺书与鲁迅虽然都针对林语堂所倡导的“幽默文学”发出批评，但并不能说他们的幽默观一脉相承，反而是钱锺书与林语堂的幽默观“似曾相识”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为同一文艺风气的见证者与参与者，钱锺书虽然与鲁迅不曾有过直接的交往，甚至让人觉得他有时是在刻意“侧目”鲁迅，而沿波讨源，拨开“迷雾”，但凡现代文学史上的重大事件，还是能够同时看到他们的身影，进而看出钱锺书对时贤包括鲁迅一贯的冷漠态度，“好比从飞沙、麦浪、波纹里看出了风的姿态”（钱锺书语）。（本文原题“风的姿态”，现标题为编者所拟）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“4.2千年事件”：地球大降温，华夏新生]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257310]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;本世纪初，随着分子生物学的进步，我们能够通过测基因探究水稻起源——检测结果显示，约1.35万年~ 8.2千年前，栽培水稻最早在长江流域被驯化，之后传播到东南亚以及南亚，与南亚的野生籼稻杂交后，产生了栽培籼米，又回流中国。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但在研究水稻起源的过程中，基因检测却带来了疑问。学者们猛然发现，其传播时间透着很多诡异之处：水稻被驯化后，长达数千年里，一直停留在中国，没有向外传播。然而到了约4.2千年~4千年前后，几乎是在同一时间，水稻忽然就出现在了日本列岛、朝鲜半岛、菲律宾、中南半岛和南亚次大陆。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这不禁让人疑惑：四千多年前到底发生了什么？ ! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从中国古籍来看，4000年前，正好是夏朝建立前后。相传大禹在治水后，曾派使者丈量“全世界”，最后计算出大地东西和南北的距离，都是二亿三万三千五百里零七十五步。这虽然只是《山海经》里的神话，但神话故事往往也有着原型：或许是大禹建立夏朝后，曾派出使者探索未知世界，顺便将水稻传播到了周边各国？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而考古上来看，4.2千年~4千年前的世界，正在遭受前所未有的巨大劫难。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果你关注中国考古，你可能听过“满天星斗”的说法，这是形容夏朝以前的各地古文明：5000~4300年前的中国，遍地都是考古遗址，西辽河有红山，黄河流域有龙山，这二者已是城邦文明；长江流域则有良渚和石家河，二者已进入王朝政治。当时的地球正处于著名的“全新世大暖期”，湿润温暖的气候让全世界文明都欣欣向荣，就连中亚沙漠和非洲的撒哈拉大沙漠，当时也是森林湖泊广布的宜居之所。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而到了4.2千年~4千年前，三大流域的文明全都崩溃，整个中华大地也陷入混乱：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;长江流域的石家河与良渚，城池纷纷毁弃，疆域急剧收缩。到3800年前，原来的核心地带几乎变成了无人区。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;西辽河流域的众多聚落更是完全消失，人口直接被换种：基因检测发现，当地后来兴起的夏家店下层文化，与之前的居民没有遗传联系。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而黄河流域同样是哀鸿遍野：考古显示黄河中下游的聚落数量，在这场浩劫中减少了将近90%，人口可能只剩原来的1/10。精致灿烂的龙山黑陶从此消失，直到一百多年后才出现一种非常粗糙的灰陶文化——这意味着原来的文明，原来的知识和技术传承，也在这场浩劫中损失殆尽。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;至于这场浩劫的由来，最常见的假说是大洪水：有学者根据考古证据，推测距今约3920年，黄河上游曾形成一个面积巨大的堰塞湖，堵塞黄河近9个月。之后堰塞湖溃堤，约160亿立方米的湖水瞬间倾泻而下，大洪水几乎荡平了整个黄河流域。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;该假说虽有一定道理，却无法解释同时期长江流域也发生了大崩溃——实际上，不仅是黄河长江，当时全世界都发生了文明大崩溃，这显然是一次波及全球的气候灾难：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中亚森林和撒哈拉湖泊消失，大沙漠从此诞生；北非尼罗河流域，兴盛了五百年的早王朝戛然而止，严重旱灾导致农业崩溃，埃及陷入长达百年的饥荒与内乱，史称“第一次中间期”；西亚两河流域，首度完成统一的阿卡德帝国，出现大量农田抛荒，随即被外来蛮族攻灭；在中欧和北欧，降温让气候变得寒冷潮湿，导致了众多族群的大迁徙……&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这次气候大灾变，如今被称为“4.2千年事件”，是一场堪称文明末日的天劫。洋流紊乱、超级火山爆发和厄尔尼诺现象叠加，可能是导致这次天灾的罪魁祸首。 4.2千年事件在不同地区表现不同，有的地方是大旱，有的地方是洪水，但总体来说都发生了大降温——实际上，这是自“新仙女木小冰期”结束后一直到今天，人类遭受过的最剧烈的一次降温。很多地方的气温，再也没能恢复到全新世大暖期的水平，舒适温暖的美好时光一去不返了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很显然，正是4.2千年事件，灭绝了西辽河先民，重创了黄河古城邦，也摧毁了长江流域的两个古老王朝。农业崩溃，饥荒横行，哀鸿遍野。短短数十年甚至数年间，就丧失了90%的人口，这是我们今人无法想象的末日景象。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而华南的少数幸存者，即长江古农夫及其后裔，不得不带上稻种，四处逃荒，寻找勉强还能耕种的新土地。他们渡海向东抵达了朝鲜半岛和日本，成为韩国人和日本渡来人的祖先；向南抵达了菲律宾，成为南岛人征服太平洋的第一站；向西穿过云贵高原，抵达中南半岛和印度，与当地的猎人土著，融合出孟-高棉语系（南亚语系）……&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;正所谓祸福相倚，末日天劫中也孕育了新生。大灾过后，华夏从此告别“满天星斗”，开始走向一体：逃荒的华南先民（长江古农夫），还有一支抵达了北方中原。他们在这里碰到了同样逃荒至此的黄河古农夫。二者融合交流，共建新家园——河南二里头所在的嵩山南北地区，在全新世大暖期并不突出，只有一些零星的小聚落。然而大崩溃后数百年，大概是各地逃难的先民汇集于此，这里迅速复兴成长。距今约3800年前，二里头已发展成整个黄河流域的最大聚落，成为无可争议的中原之主。它旋即开始大肆扩张，很快成为整个东亚都无可匹敌的强盛王朝——很多学者相信，它就是古籍中的夏朝，华夏一统的时代来临了。 &lt;/p>;

font-weight: bold;&quot;>;大部分时候，白客也不知道自己能力的边界在哪里，凭感觉。接戏也不那么讲究章法，投缘才好。这几年他演了多部关照现实的影剧，在《不虚此行》《温柔壳》里露面，他说，“我这身体里蕴藏的能力都是制片人跟导演发掘的，要谢他们。”而他自己则默默做好演员的本职，用技法、用情感、用天分，对每一次表演负责。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/vsBMgnmHeYijo0WGszOvBYMoRoFft3vyR6cl1cIK.jpg&quot;

title=&quot;白客：一名“又怂又丧”的演员的生存之道&quot;>;白客：一名“又怂又丧”的演员的生存之道&lt;/a>;》&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年6月9日，上海国际电影节开幕红毯上，演员白客出现了三次。在之后持续10天的展映中，他是《寻她》里的甘耀祖、《年会不能停！ 》里的马杰、《不虚此行》里的潘聪聪，无论主角配角、喜剧正剧，他都对角色做出了恰如其分的表达。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对白客来说，成为演员是意料之外的事。大学毕业前夕因为玩配音走红，2010年，从中国传媒大学南广学院毕业后，他短暂在电视台工作，之后很快北上，加入影视公司万合天宜。在公司摇摇欲坠、人人盘算各奔前程时拍了短剧《万万没想到》，救活了公司，导演、演员们一炮而红。 《万万没想到》的男主角，自恋自嘲、草根本分的王大锤，就是白客演的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;早年的走红经历和“过好自己的小日子”的家庭教诲一交织，最后导出一种随遇而安的性格。他有自己的舒适区，觉得待在那里挺好。工作之余，就和伙伴踢球、看球、看漫画追剧、陪伴父母。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从小到大唯一一次跳出舒适圈的经历，是原本话少的他决定报考播音专业，因为喜欢足球，想当足球解说员。读了四年传媒专业，虽然没能成为解说员，但他对“记录”这件事变得敏感了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;白客看中《寻她》剧本也与此有关，传统村庄里一场女性自我觉知的探寻，他说：“这种事情对我来说是一个很有意义的话题，我觉得需要记录。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因为要背粤语台词，和舒淇对戏，《寻她》的拍摄对于白客来说并不轻松。有一场他和舒淇吵架的戏，大段粤语对白，原本要在演员互相适应之后再拍。但剧组一到拍摄地惠州就遇上台风，为了躲避糟糕天气，导演陈仕忠打算先拍室内那场吵架戏。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“他不会在拍摄前说我很害怕，也不会说我一定能做到，然后他能完成得很好。他很松弛，但是内心有强大能量。”后来陈仕忠才知道白客很紧张，但他藏起来了。陈仕忠看过他出演的一个记者角色，看完那天发了个朋友圈：白客能给导演很大的安全感。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“他是像水一样的演员，怎么搭都可以，可塑性是很强的。”陈仕忠说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 14:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[杭州亚运会主媒体中心里有什么？南周记者带你去探营]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257322]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
