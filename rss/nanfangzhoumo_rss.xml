The militants attempted to attack an air force training base in Miyanwali, Punjab. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the incident, the &quot;Pakistan Jihad Movement&quot; issued a statement to the media stating that it was responsible for the attack. This is a newly emerged armed organization affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban (referred to as &quot;Bata&quot;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Many interviewed experts and scholars told Southern Weekend reporters that the Bata Organization has recently frequently launched various forms of terrorist attacks in Pakistan in an attempt to achieve its political goals. The purpose has brought great pressure to Pakistan&#39;s security situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is noteworthy that Pakistan announced a large-scale &quot;deportation order&quot; on October 3, indicating that there are more than 1.7 million undocumented foreigners (mostly Afghan refugees) who are in Pakistan illegally must leave the country by November 1 or face arrest and deportation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This decision has caused concern among tens of thousands of Afghans. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Major host countries for Afghan refugees&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp ;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Majda, 31, was born in Pakistan and lives with her husband and six children in an apartment building in Sohrab Goth. Here, Saurabh Goth is a seedy suburb with narrow streets littered with garbage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;We have no home and no job in Afghanistan,&quot; she told the media. Her family had relevant documents but were still harassed. &quot;Pakistan is our home, we have been living here for a long time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;We have our own barbecue restaurant and butcher shop here.&quot; Mohammad &quot;This country is driving away its guests,&quot; he said before boarding the bus back to Afghanistan.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sayyid Muhammad is an undocumented Afghan refugee and One of the immigrants. When he carried the doctor&#39;s prescription for his ailing mother on his shoulders to the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, he found no store where he could buy the medicine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Detention centers&quot; have been set up in four provinces of Pakistan to detain &quot;illegal&quot; foreigners who have not left the country within the time limit. Most refugees and migrants gathered at border crossings, awaiting exit procedures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Most Afghan refugees entered Pakistan at three points in time: the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, the US invasion after the &quot;911&quot; incident, and the Afghan regime change in 2021 After the change. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The United Nations Refugee Agency announced that there are approximately 2 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan, making it the country hosting the largest number of Afghan refugees. But the process for refugees to obtain a legal residence permit in Pakistan is by no means easy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;“Many Afghan refugees have their own businesses and houses in Pakistan, and their children go to school there&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;,&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;Their descendants have not even seen Afghanistan&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;.&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;”&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Atta Nassib, professor of international affairs at George Washington University, said&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;,&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;But given that Pakistan does not have a dual citizenship law, most Afghans cannot obtain Pakistani citizenship. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, it was a time when the United States and the Soviet Union were competing for hegemony. The United States and other NATO countries hope that Pakistan can accept Afghan refugees and provide financial and material support to Pakistan to ease the pressure on Pakistan to accept refugees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;With the help of international aid, Pakistan not only built refugee camps, but also helped refugees work and receive education, and also provided certain policy support. For Pakistan at that time, hosting refugees became a win-win choice, and the domestic economy also developed to a certain extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Jiadong, director of the South Asian Studies Center at Fudan University, believes that during the war, Pakistan received aid from many countries, and Pakistan also used part of the aid money to help Afghan refugees. . But now, many countries have reduced or even stopped aid. Pakistan&#39;s economic burden has also risen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Pakistan&#39;s expulsion may cause more contradictions and conflicts with Afghanistan in the short term.&quot; Zhang Jiadong said, but from the perspective of Pakistan , driving some people back will make it easier to control the remaining refugees, that is, &quot;long-term pain is worse than short-term pain.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In addition to economic issues, the grievances between Pakistan and Afghanistan are particularly deep.&quot; He said that Pakistan and Afghanistan also have many cross-border ethnic issues, which have led to constant border disputes. At present, these contradictions have not been properly resolved. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Love and hate&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The terrorist attack on November 4 is not uncommon in Pakistan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 6 this year, fierce conflicts broke out between Pakistani and Afghan border guards, and Pakistan subsequently closed a key crossing point with Afghanistan in the northwest. On the same day, armed men attacked two Pakistani security posts near Pakistan&#39;s northern border, killing four soldiers and 12 attackers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Pakistani military noted in a statement that the attackers were &quot;equipped with the latest weapons&quot; and suggested they may have crossed the border from Afghanistan. Pakistan urges not to allow terrorists to use Afghan soil to carry out long-term terrorist acts against Pakistan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the past two years, the violence of &quot;Bata&quot;-led attacks has increased. Just in January 2023, a suicide bombing occurred at a mosque in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province in northwestern Pakistan on the afternoon of the 30th. Hundreds of people died and more than 200 were injured. On the night of the incident, &quot;Bata&quot; members said that the attack was revenge for the previous police crackdown on Bata. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Ma Jianfu, director of the Pakistan Studies Center at Northern University for Nationalities, believes that after the change of Afghan regime, the bilateral relations that Pakistan expected were not established. Instead, conflicts and frictions continued, especially There have been many exchanges of fire in border areas. Pakistan has also become the target of terrorist attacks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since 2023, in addition to frequent attacks by traditional terrorist forces in Pakistan, the Khorasan branch of the &quot;Islamic State&quot; has also begun to attack Afghanistan. Transfer within Pakistan. This has caused tremendous security and domestic pressure on Pakistan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;It is difficult for Pakistan to control border security issues, and the cost is extremely high in reality.&quot; Zhang Jiadong said that a large number of weapons are now flowing from Afghanistan to Pakistan, which has become a problem for many Equipment of anti-Pakistani militants. &quot;Afghanistan is not particularly active in helping Pakistan, which makes Pakistan quite annoyed.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Pakistani government also accused Afghanistan of providing provision for militant groups that carried out these attacks. provided a &quot;safe haven&quot;, causing tensions in Pakistan-Afghanistan relations. It said that of the 24 suicide bombings in Pakistan in 2023, 14 were carried out by Afghans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But what is noteworthy is that as early as the 1990s, when the Taliban first seized power in Afghanistan, some Taliban members came from Pakistan. Many media reports stated that Pakistani military officers even directly participated in the Taliban&#39;s operations at that time and received support from the Pakistan Intelligence Agency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Pakistan is an important regional player in the power game in Afghanistan.&quot; Ma Jianfu said. However, the rise of the Taliban has stimulated the development of religious extremism and ethnic separatism in South Asia, causing refugee and drug problems to further spill over into South Asia, resulting in severe challenges to the regional security situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Other armed organizations saw that they could successfully seize power, and they also tried to imitate and follow suit. This is a major incentive for terrorist forces in Pakistan to become active again.&quot; Zeng Xiangyu Analysis shows that the security situation in Pakistan had improved in the past few years, but has worsened significantly recently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is undeniable that Baa has a unique relationship. For example, the two countries share a border of about 2,570 kilometers and are also important trading partners. There are also many close ties with each other such as culture, race and religion. The outside world believes that Pakistan and Afghanistan are &quot;love-hate&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Pakistan has hosted millions of Afghan refugees for many years. This is not an easy task.&quot; Zeng Xiangyu said that not every country can do this Not to mention that Pakistan is not a rich country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Ma Jianfu believes that Pakistan has tried to expel or repatriate Afghan refugees many times over the past decades, but with poor results. The regular flow of Afghan refugees to and from the Pakistan-Afghanistan border area has become the norm. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Deportation order&quot; is also a &quot;pressure order&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot; text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Today we say goodbye to the people of Afghanistan as they begin their journey home .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Earlier, Pakistan’s interior minister publicly tweeted on social media and attached a video of Afghans boarding a bus, adding &quot;This action proves that Pakistan is determined to deport any individual living in the country without proper documentation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;&quot;If they don&#39;t send us Send it back and we will live here for the rest of our lives.&quot; 35-year-old Afghan Mohammad Rahim&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;,&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; was born in Pakistan. He married a Pakistani woman,&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; span>;&lt;span>;Together&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Raising Pakistani-born children without Pakistani identity documents. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Mohmand, who has lived in Pakistan for more than ten years, has three children and a big family. Mohmand has no family in Afghanistan. She didn&#39;t know where to go next. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;For decades, millions of Afghan refugees have lived in Pakistan for a long time, bringing huge financial burdens and various risks to Pakistan. A large number of illegal refugees The detention of Afghan refugees not only brings certain security risks, but also has a certain impact on the employment of Pakistanis.&quot; Ma Jianfu analyzed that Pakistan&#39;s expulsion of Afghan refugees is also due to economic pressure. Undocumented immigrants and refugees are widely believed to have drained the country&#39;s resources for decades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For Pakistan&#39;s &quot;deportation order&quot; operation, the United Nations Refugee Agency and the International Organization for Migration condemned Pakistan&#39;s plan to bring &quot; Serious protection risk”. Restrictions on female NGO staff in Afghanistan have resulted in fewer employment opportunities for women in the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Data from the United Nations Refugee Agency shows that among Afghans who have recently returned home, 78% said that fear of being arrested in Pakistan was the reason for their departure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Pakistan&#39;s expulsion of Afghan refugees this time will further worsen the relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan and put tremendous pressure on Afghanistan.&quot; Ma Jianfu told Southern Weekend reporters, Due to complex reasons, it will be difficult for Pakistan&#39;s expulsion work to proceed normally, and it may also trigger armed resistance and worsen the anti-terrorism and security situation in both countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zeng Xiangyu analyzed that this is not the first time that the Pakistani government has expelled Afghan refugees. Pakistan only uses the refugees as a tool to put pressure on Afghanistan. Pakistan&#39;s expulsion will not go too far, because some terrorist forces and extremist forces are trying to take advantage of this opportunity, so Pakistan&#39;s move is likely to be &quot;loud and rainy&quot; and achieve the desired effect through large-scale propaganda. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Pakistan&#39;s pressure strategy has been tried and tested time and time again.&quot; He said. As long as the relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan is tense, Pakistan will expel the refugees &quot;until Afghanistan cannot bear it anymore and will give in to Pakistan.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 2, local time, the Ministry of Refugees and Repatriation of the interim government of Afghanistan stated that the Taliban government is currently providing assistance from multiple locations to families returning to Afghanistan from Pakistan. , and placed them in temporary camps. At the same time, some families with residential houses left the camps and went to the provinces where they lived, but there were also some families who did not have shelter and faced challenges in their lives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Taliban government also stated that it will try its best to find jobs for the returnees. However, according to World Bank data, Afghanistan&#39;s unemployment rate more than doubled from the time the Taliban took over to June 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Many experts and scholars told Southern Weekend reporters that international sanctions on Afghanistan’s banking industry and the reduction of international aid to Afghanistan after the Taliban took over would lead to return Immigrants and refugees put enormous pressure on already limited resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 17:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[当引进的高学历人才决定离开县城]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260140]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On the morning of February 13, 2019, a city&#39;s talent service &quot;one-stop&quot; platform The window was opened, and applications for housing security for the first batch of imported talents in the city began to be accepted.

The city’s first batch of imported talents applied for housing security. (Visual China/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In September 2023, when tens of millions of college graduates are flocking to job fairs, 27-year-old Lu Min I was worried about how to resign from the bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A year ago, she returned to her hometown of Henan through talent introduction and was admitted to the Human Resources and Social Security Bureau of a county in northern Henan. The reason for her choice is also very simple. Five years ago, she graduated from a 985 university in Shanghai with a bachelor&#39;s degree in human resources management. She changed many jobs but could not satisfy her parents. &quot;They felt that I must have an establishment.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There is no need to repeat the enthusiasm of parents and students for public examinations and compilation examinations. In the past, it was a stereotype unique to certain provinces, but now it has become The other side that everyone dreams of reaching. But there is obviously more than one road leading to Rome. In addition to the conventional paths such as national examinations, public examinations, and selection and transfer, the relatively low-key talent introduction policy that has been in place for many years has attracted more and more attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Talent introduction, as the name suggests, is a recruitment method used by local institutions, usually in counties or urban areas, to recruit graduates with master&#39;s and doctoral degrees from well-known universities to work within the system. . Different from the administrative establishment provided by selection and recruitment of civil servants, talent introduction can only provide career establishment. Places that adopt the talent introduction method will omit the written examination link and promise candidates a certain talent subsidy, settling-in allowance, etc., which is intended to reflect the needs of the local area. The wise are like thirsty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the opening of autumn recruitment in 2023, a new round of talent introduction has also begun. On various recruitment consultation websites, there are many announcements about remote counties offering high salary subsidies and hiring masters or even PhDs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But at the same time, some young people who were attracted found that the balance between ideal life and reality was far more difficult than imagined. The problem is not new. If the county can still provide the &quot;one-stop-seen&quot; life that our parents did, it may not be able to match the talents they are vying to introduce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In an article published in 2022, Fang Changchun, a professor at the School of Social Sciences at Nanjing University and director of the Employment Quality Research Center, once pointed out that various regions are actively recruiting highly educated talents. While being open-minded, we should also accurately select and use materials based on the actual economic and social development of the county, and treat the use of talents with caution. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“I was a little anxious to go ashore at that time”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Back to a Thursday in May 2022, Lu Min was attending tutoring She was in class and preparing for a teacher preparation exam when she got a call asking if she could participate in the county talent recruitment interview on Saturday. She signed up three months ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are only two days left before the interview. The day before the exam, Lu Min dug out the high school uniform from the bottom of the box - a black suit jacket, paired with a light blue shirt and dark suit pants, to make up a complete formal suit. In the evening, I made a phone call with a friend who was familiar with public examinations to improve my interview skills. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This is a one-person interview. The examination room was a classroom in a local middle school. In the middle, there was a table prepared for interviewers, covered with a piece of white paper. Opposite, five examiners sat side by side, with timers placed beside the table. 10 minutes, the countdown has not started yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It was hard to contain the tension, but fortunately, the temporary assault content came in handy. Similar to the exam preparation guide, among the three interview questions Lu Min encountered, the first question was pragmatic and asked about work attitude; the last two questions were pragmatic and asked what to do if agricultural products are unsaleable and how to properly place trash cans in the community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Lu Min later reviewed his performance on that day and consciously answered well, &quot;I took the impact of the epidemic into consideration for the last two questions,&quot; but for the first question &quot;I should quote more materials, but I was nervous and forgot about it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This is not the first time Lu Min has sought to enter the system. After graduating from college in 2018, in order to meet her parents&#39; expectations, she took the civil service exam in her hometown city once, but stopped taking the written exam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the spring of 2021, Lu Min joined a private vocational and technical college as a teacher. This job has no establishment, but the teaching pressure is low and there are many vacations, which once made her very satisfied. However, her parents gave her an ultimatum and she must take the entrance examination in 2022. To this end, starting from February 2022, Lu Min &quot;cast his net everywhere.&quot; Most of the positions applied for were for teachers, but the only one who heard back was the one for talent introduction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;One ​​week after the interview, Lu Min received the notification that he had successfully landed. She was happy at first, &quot;I can finally shut my parents&#39; mouths.&quot; But worries soon struck that this was not a job she really wanted after all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A year has passed, and Lu Min is always wandering around the personnel files. Compared with many other government agencies, this job is considered gentle. Except for the employment season, she only needs to send and receive three or four files a day. However, she was never sure whether this was her ideal life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Unlike Lu Min, Meng Qiping was already 35 years old before he successfully landed through talent introduction, and his life was full of frustrations and dissatisfaction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2017, Meng Qiping graduated from a general state university in the United States with a science major. After returning to China for employment, he worked as a programmer and an IELTS training teacher. In 2020, before the &quot;double reduction&quot; was implemented, he went to the UK to study for graduate school. After graduating in 2022, he applied for a doctorate from a school in Malaysia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although at that time, going to Southeast Asia to study for a Ph.D. had become synonymous with &quot;mixed&quot; academic qualifications, the pressure of studying for a Ph.D. was still beyond his expectation, and &quot;the frustration was relatively strong.&quot; . In October 2022, Meng Qiping dropped out of school and returned to China again. This time, he set his sights on the hottest thing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As a native of Kunming, recruiting talents from this province was his first choice. However, after several interviews, Meng Qiping found that because the salary offered by Yunnan was very attractive, The competition is too fierce, and it is normal for &quot;about ten people to compete for one or two positions&quot;. After many failures, at the end of 2022, Meng Qiping decided to move to northern Guangxi to participate in a talent introduction interview in a certain county. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Recruitment information shows that the position Meng Qiping applied for at that time was a &quot;party and government talent position without restriction on majors&quot;, with a total of 10 positions open. On the day of the interview, he unexpectedly discovered that due to the epidemic, only 6 applicants came to participate. &quot;This means that as long as you attend the interview, you can get a job,&quot; Meng Qiping said happily. He didn&#39;t know it at the time, but this job would just add to his years of wandering life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 18, 2023, one month after resigning from the county’s Culture, Broadcasting, Sports and Tourism Bureau, Meng Qiping once again recalled the choice he made a year ago, admitting that “at that time Some are eager to get ashore.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On October 13, 2023, a job fair in Mengzi City, Yunnan Province.

(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Refreshing the highest educational level of employees in the unit”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The rush to go ashore is not a person’s idea, but a spread The anxiety that comes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Meng Qiping later learned that the five people who passed the interview in the same batch as him were, without exception, master students. One of them also had an overseas study background, and two of them had a background in overseas study. They were assigned to the County Culture, Broadcasting, Sports and Tourism Bureau, which “refreshed the highest educational level for employees in the history of the bureau.” Lu Min, who lives in the northern county of Henan, mentioned that the people introduced with her all graduated from 985 and 211 universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the end of 2022, the &lt;span>;Institute of Sociology of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the Social Science Literature Press jointly released&lt;/span>;&#39;s &quot;Social Blue Book: 2023&quot; &quot;China Social Situation Analysis and Forecast&quot; mentioned that between 2018 and 2021, more and more college students want to abandon first- and second-tier cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and return to third- and fourth-tier small and medium-sized cities, small counties, grassroots towns and rural work . In August 2023, the 2022 College Students Returning Home Employment Survey Report released by the educational research organization Max Research Institute also mentioned that the proportion of graduates returning home for employment is on the rise, and nearly half work within the system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The flow of talents into the county system is exactly what the local government expects. Deqing County, Zhejiang Province, a county with a permanent population of only 650,000. In an interview event in early 2020, a total of 316 master&#39;s and doctoral graduate students from prestigious domestic and foreign universities such as Fudan University, Zhejiang University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and Columbia University participated. &lt; span>;In the end, only 23 people passed and are expected to obtain career establishment&lt;/span>;. In the official publicity, the interpretation that “the competition for talents has reached a record high” is highlighted in bold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Incomplete statistics from Southern Weekend reporters show that since August 2023, more than 10 provinces have announced talent introduction plans for public institutions in their counties and cities, and single recruitment is open. The number of positions mostly exceeds 100, among which full-time master&#39;s and doctoral graduates are the main recruitment targets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;We have been doing this for a long time by taking part of our staff to recruit people in other universities and colleges. It is just a term used to introduce talents in recent years. It was made more clear.&quot; Wang Meng works in the Organization Department of a municipal party committee in a southwest city. According to her memories, the province held a talent work conference in 2021, which specifically listed talent work as a focus and established talent at the provincial and municipal levels. Work first area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to Wang Meng’s observation, counties and districts that can vigorously recruit talents usually have a leading industry or leading industry. “Like Anshan, the local area will definitely choose some steel industries. Professional talents in this field can do research and have development prospects.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Small cities show their enthusiasm as much as possible. Wang Meng&#39;s area provides free talent apartments and house purchase subsidies for high-level postgraduate talents. If they work for more than five years, there is also a cash reward. Children&#39;s education, parents&#39; medical treatment, free physical examinations, etc. are also supporting benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, an unavoidable fact is that the boom in talent introduction is also driven by policy factors. Southern Weekend reporters searched and found that the talent introduction work first appeared in the public eye, which can be traced back to 15 years ago. In 2008, places such as Rizhao in Shandong, Hebi in Henan, and Fuzhou in Jiangxi took the lead in proposing to open up some positions in public institutions to introduce high-level and high-quality talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Two years later, in May 2010, the Second National Talent Work Conference was held, &quot;National Medium and Long-term Talent Development Plan Outline (2010-2020)&quot; Issued. Zhang Lei, an economist at the Qingxu County Personnel Examination Center in Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, mentioned in the paper that under the influence of policies, party and government agencies and public institutions across the country have also begun to pay attention to talent work and regard it as an important part of the reform of public institutions. carry out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A staff member of the Organization Department of Yongjing County Party Committee in Gansu Province recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that &lt;span>; his county started to introduce talents in 2020. Initially, In two years, I can recruit two or three times a year&lt;/span>;, but the number will be less in the future. &quot;I can&#39;t say when the next time will be. It&#39;s possible that we won&#39;t recruit next year, or we may recruit again. The establishment is dead, and if the unit is short of people, we will definitely recruit.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; As the number of participating counties and cities increases, the “level” of talent becomes higher and higher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In August 2023, Yucheng, a county-level city under the jurisdiction of Dezhou City, Shandong Province, a city famous for Dayu&#39;s flood control, issued an announcement, It is planned to introduce 6 Ph.D.s to work in municipal units under the jurisdiction of five departments including the Yucheng City Government Office, Science and Technology Bureau, Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau, and Commerce Bureau. This is the first time that local talent recruitment has been specifically targeted at Ph.D. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In the past, our standard for recruiting talents was that only master&#39;s degree students and above were required.&quot; A reporter from Southern Weekend contacted the other party in the name of applying for a job, and the person responsible for the recruitment Staff from the social sector explained on the phone that the reason for raising standards was “mainly to attract talents.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Selection methods specially formulated for talents also emerged. Different from the preliminary review, qualification review, written examination, interview and other processes required for regular recruitment in public institutions, the human resources and social affairs department will organize a group of applicants from time to time to conduct centralized interviews within one to two months through staff introduction and doctoral introduction. Just choose. As of late September, the centralized interviews for the first batch of applicants have ended. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The imported talents are relatively easy to use.&quot; Wang Meng introduced that the talent introduction in his city will arrange for face-to-face communication between employers and job seekers, &quot; Asking about your intentions, future development direction, everything can be asked, and the evaluation and understanding of a person will be clearer and deeper.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“The level of economic development is here”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;More generous salaries and better benefits, in the aforementioned paper , Zhang Lei mentioned that in order to attract talents, &quot;giving money, giving houses, and giving household registration&quot; have become the &quot;three axes&quot; of local governments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As the person directly responsible for the talent introduction work, Wang Meng knows very well that many highly educated talents come here for the settlement subsidies and cash rewards. Before the epidemic, the brain drain rate in her area had always been relatively serious. To solve this problem, welfare benefits were indispensable. &quot;After all, there is a war for talent everywhere.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, after winning the iron rice bowl as expected, highly educated talents may also encounter disappointment in actual work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Before joining the job, Meng Qiping paid special attention to the fact that the county&#39;s &quot;monthly basic salary is 4,000, and the performance at the end of the year is 30,000&quot; for introducing talents. In the local The conditions are quite good. But it wasn’t until he officially joined the company in March 2023 that he learned that in addition to the 4,000 yuan monthly talent subsidy for the first five years, the more than 4,000 yuan received at the end of the month already included a monthly prepayment performance bonus of 1,500 yuan, which would be paid at the end of the year. The actual performance does not exceed 10,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Like Meng Qiping, Lu Min&#39;s actual salary after joining the company was also lower than expected. &quot;I received more than two thousand, and with the recent cancellation of assessments, the salary was reduced every month.&quot; Thirty or forty yuan.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Meng Qiping concluded afterwards, &quot;The salary levels in various places are not very transparent, which means that you have to go in to know the true salary levels.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Most counties and cities that introduce talents can offer limited treatment conditions. In the aforementioned telephone consultation, the Southern Weekend reporter had not yet asked about the target salary level. He only mentioned another prefecture-level city, and a staff member of the Yucheng City Human Resources and Social Security Department added, &quot;We are a county-level city, and the salary you expected must be the same.&quot; There is a difference because the level of economic development is here.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to the staff member, after the introduced talents with master&#39;s degree become regular workers, they will receive The salary is about 4,300 yuan. If you graduate from a &quot;double first-class&quot; university, there will be an additional monthly subsidy of 1,300 yuan. The salary for a doctoral degree must refer to the document standards published by the government&#39;s official website. However, Southern Weekend reporters did not find the details of the relevant documents on the official website. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Being acclimatized&quot; is also Du Lin&#39;s experience. In 2022, through talent introduction, she got a job as a business editor in a prefecture-level city in central Gansu with a population of less than 500,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Du Lin graduated from an ordinary university in the west with a bachelor&#39;s degree. She is the first employee recruited by the company through talent introduction. Most of her colleagues are junior college graduates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;After studying for a few more years, I was always told that I was too old to find a partner. Several male colleagues in their thirties and forties also introduced me to A local unemployed man, they always ask me, how was your conversation.&quot; This very traditional value evaluation made Du Lin feel uncomfortable. &lt;span>;Although she is also from another county&lt;/span>;, &quot;My family never said that I should get married as soon as possible, and they never said that I should stop studying when I get older.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Nearly two months after joining the company, Du Lin did not receive clear information about her position. &quot;Department, office, workstation, none of these.&quot; She was once assigned to debug the online conference equipment. After the meeting started, a male colleague came over and said that the leader&#39;s office needed to be cleaned, &quot;I need to learn how to be a good person first.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;There are already cleaning staff in the unit.&quot; Du Lin guessed that maybe using her to give her colleagues a &quot;sense of superiority&quot;, but delving deeper, the reason It may be that the entry of highly educated talents has brought them career anxiety. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Meng Qiping also had similar feelings. He imitated the tone of his colleagues: &quot;Hey, what&#39;s the difficulty with this? Don&#39;t be afraid, there are graduate students here to support them. Graduate students can do everything.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Dilemma of Over-education&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot; text-align: left;&quot;>;Graduate students who “know everything” may be doing the job they are least good at. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When they first joined the company, Du Lin and Meng Qiping both worked in the unit&#39;s general office. This is seen as a regular way to sharpen newcomers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;While working in the general office, Meng Qiping and other colleagues needed to follow a roster. When it&#39;s his turn, he has to rush to the office early in the morning, and then start various chores: making tea, booking a bus, taking photos, and printing name tags. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Meng Qiping’s view, this job does not require a graduate student. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The accumulated pressure and confusion finally erupted late at night after a basketball game during the May Day holiday. When Meng Qiping returned home after one o&#39;clock in the morning, he suddenly questioned his years of hard study. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In fact, there is no difference in promotion and work content between talent introduction and those who are admitted to public institutions through other methods.&quot; As a recruiter of talent introduction , Wang Meng does not deny that the county’s talent carrying capacity is not as sufficient as imagined. There was once a doctor who was admitted to her urban area through selective transfer, but because &quot;he was doing very basic work&quot; and it was not in line with his expectations, he was not able to retain it in the end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the view of Luo Rundong, director of the Institute of Labor Economics of Shandong University (Weihai), such educated people engage in jobs that do not match their academic qualifications, which leads to their The phenomenon that the skills learned cannot be fully utilized is over-education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In a paper study published in 2010, based on the comprehensive social survey data CGSS, Luo Rundong and Peng Mingming, a doctoral student at the Institute of Economics of Nankai University, conducted a study on different Statistics on overeducation among employees with higher education in type units. The results show that the proportion of overeducation in administrative agencies and public institutions is generally higher than that in business units, and among business units, state-owned or state-controlled enterprises are higher than those in foreign-funded enterprises and private enterprises. At the same time, when other conditions are equal, party and government agencies, public institutions, state-owned or state-controlled enterprises and other units will further continue to increase the proportion of over-education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Today, the phenomenon that everyone yearns for and needs higher education is more obvious than when the paper was published. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 25, 2023, when a Southern Weekend reporter consulted the Talent Office of Libo County, Guizhou Province as a master&#39;s student at a 211 university, the staff first repeatedly Emphasizing that the work content does not conflict with the majors studied, he then revealed that in the early stages of work, the tasks assigned by the unit to introduce talents are generally very easy, such as sending and receiving documents or writing materials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the past year, Lu Min thought that she was just doing a &quot;screw&quot; job. It only took a short time for her, who graduated from human resources management, to get started with sending and receiving files. The one-year probationary period passed quickly, and she was on the verge of becoming a full-time employee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Recruitment season has recently arrived, and the bureau has welcomed batches of interviewees. One day, Lu Min recognized at a glance that one of the interviewees was his high school classmate. The other party quickly recognized her, &quot;You actually work here?&quot; The surprise in her tone could not be concealed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The other party&#39;s grades in high school were not as good as mine. This time he applied with a graduate degree.&quot; Thinking of his undergraduate degree, Lu Min had a feeling Shame. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But what makes her feel even more &quot;inferior&quot; is the small county where she works and lives. &quot;Most of my college classmates are in Shanghai. Among middle school and high school classmates, most of them are in Beijing, as well as Shenzhen and Guangzhou. They often post in their circle of friends about where they traveled and what exhibitions they saw on the weekend.&quot; And in the county town , not even a few shopping malls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Lu Min thought, &quot;If I can be admitted to a graduate school, my life may open up another situation.&quot; On September 18, 2023, she hid the secret from her parents. I submitted my resignation letter and concentrated on preparing for the postgraduate examination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In August, four months after joining the company, Meng Qiping also decided to leave. He learned that one of the six people who came ashore gave up before joining the company. Among the remaining five people, apart from myself, one also has the idea of ​​​​resigning, and two others hope to &quot;be admitted to the civil service.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He saw a talent dilemma unique to the county. &quot;On the one hand, the county needs talents to build it, but after the talents do come, it seems that many times they cannot play the role they should play.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Like a After closing the loop, Meng Qiping’s next plan changed back to studying for a Ph.D. He hopes to get a teaching position in a domestic university after completing his PhD. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Lu Min, Meng Qiping, Du Lin, and Wang Meng are pseudonyms)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[男子有偿代骂被拘：Al正推动新业态进化，购买服务者是否担责？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260134]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a security case has attracted attention. According to the Zhuzhou police report, the man Yi Mou uses paid &quot;scolding&quot; on the Internet as a way to make money. According to the customer&#39;s requirements, he personally attacks and insults specific objects through WeChat and phone calls, and charges fees ranging from 20 to 30 yuan. , causing serious impact on the victim’s work and life. From February 2023 to now, Yi has made more than 3,000 yuan in profits by relying on such illegal services. Currently, Yi has been placed under administrative detention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not the first time that practitioners of scolding have been punished. In August 2023, the police in Changsha, Hunan Province captured Li Moudong, who posted a &quot;swearing&quot; advertisement online, and detained him in accordance with the law. According to police investigation, Li Moudong helped customers verbally abuse others online on designated social platforms for 100 yuan a day, and has made illegal profits of nearly 10,000 yuan since October 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The risk of &quot;scolding on behalf of others&quot; is that the person being scolded may call the police. Article 42 of the &quot;Public Security Administration Punishment Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; stipulates that &quot;repeatedly sending obscene, insulting, threatening or other information that interferes with the normal life of others&quot; constitutes a violation and shall be detained for not more than five days or fined not more than 500 yuan; if the circumstances are serious, In serious cases, the offender shall be detained for not less than five days but not more than ten days, and may also be fined not more than five hundred yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While the police punish the illegal behavior of &quot;screamers&quot;, there are also several issues worthy of in-depth consideration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, scolding has already broken the law. Do people who purchase &quot;scolding services&quot; need to bear legal responsibility? In other words, by spending this money, the buyer can &quot;use someone&#39;s mouth to curse others&quot;, thereby achieving the effect of &quot;using a borrowed knife to kill people&quot;, and can still exempt themselves from responsibility? Judging from this case, Yi has replaced at least a hundred people to insult others. If there are cases of &quot;serious consequences&quot;, then the person who paid for the &quot;mouth substitute&quot; has become a hidden &quot;behind-the-scenes manipulator&quot; , you can brazenly &quot;buy evil and curse others&quot;. Is this because the target of each business is too small and not handled? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Civil Code of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; stipulates that if two or more people jointly commit infringement and cause damage to others, they shall bear joint and several liability. Anyone who instigates or helps others commit infringements shall bear joint and several liability with the perpetrator. Theoretically, the person who purchases the scolding service is the source of the infringement, which meets the identification standard of &quot;instigating and helping others to commit infringement&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, &quot;swearing&quot; itself is a very broad and general concept, and there is a problem of how to define it. Which verbal attacks are considered curses, and which curses are personal attacks and insults that are suspected of illegal crimes? There is still a very large range of distribution, and it is not suitable to generalize. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is also &quot;swearing&quot; in a broad sense. Verbal counterattacks after encountering injustice are obviously not comparable to organized and premeditated verbal bullying and insults. The former can be regarded as legitimate in language no matter how you say it. defensive. In addition to the &quot;cussing service&quot;, there is also the &quot;quarrel service&quot;. This kind of &quot;storm in the teapot&quot; is less likely to be suspected of illegal crimes. Following this line of thinking, the old-school literati&#39;s &quot;knowing yourself and your enemy&quot;, &quot;stopping in moderation&quot;, &quot;speaking elegantly&quot; and &quot;retreating in order to advance&quot; - these &quot;elegant scolding&quot; tactics used today are still outdated, and I am afraid it will be more difficult to classify them as words and deeds that violate the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to imagine that the reason why these scolders were detained was because their words and deeds met the definition of personal attack and insult, constituted an infringement on the victim, and were even suspected of illegal crimes, rather than general &quot;swearing someone&quot;. The development of mobile Internet technology has only made personal attacks, insults, slander and defamation more convenient, and has even turned it into a &quot;service&quot; that can be traded on the platform. Technology itself is neutral, and there will naturally be &quot;services to praise&quot; and &quot;services to scold&quot;. These &quot;emotional needs&quot; are rooted in the depths of human nature. &quot;Screaming service&quot; seems to be a new thing, but its core is quite old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirdly, since &quot;cussing service&quot; is a new business format supported by Internet technology, technological progress may also give rise to newer &quot;swearing&quot; business formats. This is probably worthy of careful consideration and strict enforcement. Alert. Generative AI, represented by the large language model ChatGPT, may bring about an even crazier and unimaginable future. It is conceivable that today&#39;s &quot;scolding services&quot; are just real people &quot;taking orders and scolding&quot; on the Internet. What if it is &quot;AI scolding&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, AI-trained face-changing, onomatopoeia, and composition are almost real. It is completely possible to clone a real person’s digital life in cyberspace, and then use a virtual number/account to intervene in reality. If you are scolded by a real-life AI dummy with a voice that is exactly the same as in real life, or by a completely virtual AI dummy, and the content of the insult is highly consistent with your personal information, and the person involved is difficult to trace , the various troubles and legal risks caused by it will definitely be several orders of magnitude higher than today&#39;s scolding by real people, which will bring greater difficulties to the protection of personality rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, if you think that someone in real life has scolded you, in fact, it is just a third party that has purchased an AI scolding service that only extracts and uses the timbre and voice characteristics of a real person. You may mistakenly have an actual interaction with the real person. Conflict, and all this is the result of manipulation by a third party. The problem this creates is to some extent isomorphic to video head-swapping. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take the recent popularity of &quot;AI dubbing&quot; as an example. From Trump to singer Taylor Swift, everyone can speak Mandarin with their own distinctive voice. &quot;AI is replacing voice workers.&quot; The prospect is not far away. If this technology is also used to &quot;scream on someone&#39;s behalf&quot;, the consequences will be even more sensational than if a real person scolds someone on their behalf. Imagine that one day your communication tool receives &quot;insulting audio and video messages&quot; from relatives, friends and even celebrities. The mental damage alone may be enough for you, and it will also take time and effort to resolve misunderstandings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, in the face of the nascent &quot;cussing service&quot; and the raging generative artificial intelligence, it is indeed necessary to proactively clarify its boundaries and define which swearing behaviors are infringing and which are suspected of illegal crimes. Purchase Do service providers who curse others need to be held accountable? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[雨季炮火，“三兄弟联盟”联军激战缅北]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260158]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 2, 2023, new refugees continue to arrive at Kokang 125 refugees Camp.

For more than ten days since then, the Kokang Allied Forces have maintained a daily update frequency on social media and announced their results in a high-profile manner. According to the Kokang Alliance Army, the Northern Myanmar Alliance Army has occupied more than 120 National Defense Forces camps and is still continuing to advance towards Lao Cai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Myanmar military government rarely expressed its position, only responding that three government-controlled areas were out of control. On November 2, the Myanmar National Defense Force declared a state of emergency and will launch a counterattack soon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In the past, civilian armed forces often launched operations against the Myanmar government forces alone. Even with the assistance of coalition forces, they fought alone on separate lines. However, this time the military operation of the Kokang Alliance Army not only involved civilian armed forces, but also It has also received response and support from other anti-military forces, which will make the war situation more complicated.&quot; Heng Kai, a Burmese Chinese scholar and assistant professor at the Institute of Overseas Chinese and Regional Countries at Huaqiao University, analyzed to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, the fighting continues to escalate. The northern Myanmar coalition forces and the National Defense Forces are constantly exchanging fire, and a confrontation situation is gradually forming around Kokang. Under the continuous gunfire, tens of thousands of people in northern Myanmar were forced to flee their homes, and the number of refugees continued to increase. Wanding, a small border town in Yunnan across the river from northern Myanmar, was also affected by the war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 2, the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on all parties to immediately cease fire and end the war, insist on resolving differences peacefully through dialogue and consultation, avoid escalation of the situation, and take practical and effective measures to ensure the security of the China-Myanmar border. safe and stable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On October 31, 2023, volunteers were unloading supplies in the Kokang 125 refugee camp.

Kyaw Hsan Hlaing, a political analyst at The Diplomat magazine, estimated that approximately 20,000 northern Myanmar coalition troops participated in the operation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Compared with previous conflicts in the Kokang area, this military operation is not only larger in scale, but also has wider and more comprehensive strategic coverage.&quot; Heng Kai pointed out that the &quot;Three Brothers Alliance&quot; not only targeted the areas including Qingshuihe They launched an offensive at the strategic location of Kokang in the country and simultaneously attacked Lashio in an attempt to contain the Myanmar National Defense Forces and prevent them from supporting northern Myanmar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 2, Zaw Min Tun, spokesperson of the Myanmar National Management Council, responded that after continuous fighting in multiple places, the three government-controlled areas of Qingshuihe, Pengxian and Bangsai were lost. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qingshuihe is located in Kokang, while Pengxian and Bangsai belong to Muse, both of which are important trade ports between China and Myanmar. The three places are close to the China-Myanmar border, and are separated by only a river of water. According to statistics from the Ministry of Commerce of the Myanmar Government, from April to September 2023, the total border trade between Myanmar and China was US$1.8 billion (approximately S$2.5 billion), more than a quarter of which was traded through Qingshui River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Myanmar ethnic local armed forces stated that blocking the road from Lashio to Qingshui River and Muse can cut off the land access of Myanmar government troops into northern Shan State. But for the people in northern Myanmar, these land passages are even more important life supply lines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Most of the supplies in Kokang Old Street rely on the Qingshui River. Now goods from China and Myanmar cannot come in, and the price of rice has soared more than three times.&quot; Alan, a Chinese from Myanmar, told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot; A bag of rice used to cost about 200 to 300 yuan, but now it has increased to 1,400 yuan.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Worried about not being able to buy supplies in the future, Alan&#39;s friend wanted to stock up on several boxes of instant noodles for emergencies, but he failed Nowhere to buy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Jiaomai and Lashio, because it is difficult to transport goods out of the country, prices are being sold at reduced prices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Akin’s family is engaged in breeding in Jiaomai, northern Myanmar. &quot;There are a large number of farmers in Jiaomai, and they usually transport eggs to Mandalay and other cities for sale. Since roads are now restricted, eggs can only be sold cheaply in the city.&quot; Ajin told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 6, 2023, workers in yellow vests were cleaning the Kokang 125 refugee camp.

It is safer at home. After all, Lashio is still in the hands of the government forces. They have a lot of heavy equipment.&quot; Aren explained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in other war zones where conflicts are more intense, it is difficult for people to choose calmly between retreating and staying. Some people had to flee in a hurry, while others were forced to stay in fear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the conflict entered the second week, the northern Myanmar coalition forces fought continuously in Gunong and the Dongshan and Xishan Districts of Kokang, gradually forming a siege on Lao Cai. The Kokang Allied Forces unilaterally stated that it had eliminated many Burmese military strongholds around Lao Cai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The situation in Lao Cai is getting more and more tense.” Zhixiang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the people in northern Myanmar are facing difficulties that are difficult to escape. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;From Lao Cai back to Lashio, you need to pass through Qingshui River, Gunong, Nanzala and Mubang. These places are either occupied by the northern Myanmar coalition forces or are engaged in fighting. It&#39;s not that they don&#39;t want to leave, but I can’t leave because I’m afraid the road will become unsafe.” Alan told Southern Weekend reporters that many of her friends are now trapped in the old streets. “They are panicking, but they have no choice.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 6, 2023, Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the United Nations Secretary-General, said that since October 26, nearly 33,000 men, women, and children have been displaced in northern Myanmar. According to local media reports in Myanmar, the resettlement sites set up near the 125 Kokang border currently accommodate more than 12,000 people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhixiang has been engaged in volunteer service in Kokang for the past 13 years. Since the conflict in northern Myanmar, his service organization and the Kokang United Youth Association have jointly taken on the operation of one of the refugee camps. In just ten days, the refugee camp has received more than 1,300 refugees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a video of the refugee camp sent by Zhixiang to Southern Weekend reporters, simple tents in various colors of red, yellow, blue and green are densely arranged in a wilderness, with intrusive rocks under the tents. and loess. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The current power supply in the camp is good, but what we lack most is water and rice, and the price of rice is getting higher and higher, making it increasingly difficult to buy.&quot; Zhixiang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to successive fierce battles between the Northern Myanmar Coalition Army and the Myanmar National Defense Force, a large number of Gounong people fled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Southern Weekend reporter contacted a person who had asked for help on the social platform. She told the Southern Weekend reporter that &quot;it has been safely evacuated&quot;, but she was unwilling to discuss the specific details. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But even safe evacuation does not mean that you are immune to the suffering of war. A family fled for safety and found the house burned to an empty shell when they returned. Zhixiang has seen too many similar scenes in the past few years. &quot;As long as you run to remote mountainous areas to escape, you will basically have nothing when you come back, and I think this time is no exception.&quot; Zhixiang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;November 6, 2023, breakfast in Kokang 125 Refugee Camp.

On August 8, 2009, the Myanmar government forces sent 30 police officers to search the Kokang Gun Repair Factory on the pretext that it was manufacturing drugs. After being refused, they formed a confrontation with the Kokang Allied Forces. Subsequently, internal strife broke out within the Kokang Allied Forces, and deputy commander Bai Suocheng led his troops to defect to the Burmese government. On August 30, Myanmar government forces took full control of Kokang, and the remaining Allied forces retreated into the mountains and forests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, the Kokang Allied Forces launched two consecutive military operations in 2015 and 2017 in an attempt to regain control of the Kokang, but both were collapsed by the Myanmar government forces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This time, the northern Myanmar coalition issued a joint statement stating that Operation &quot;1027&quot; aims to unite all revolutionary organizations to overthrow the dictatorship of the Myanmar military group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;October 29 is the 1,000th day that the Myanmar military government came to power. In Heng Kai&#39;s view, it was not accidental that the civilian armed forces in northern Myanmar chose such a time to launch the attack, but was based on comprehensive considerations of strategic goals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;After the 2021 coup, Myanmar launched a massive anti-military operation, with constant conflicts between government forces and opposition forces. The northern Myanmar coalition launched military operations in the name of &#39;anti-dictatorship&#39;, making it easier to obtain counter-attacks.&quot; The military forces responded.&quot; Heng Kai analyzed that the most fundamental purpose was to recapture Kokang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For more than ten days, the northern Myanmar coalition forces have continued to advance towards Kokang. It said that from October 27 to November 5, three civilian armed forces had captured more than 120 National Defense Force camps. However, the Myanmar military government did not respond directly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The Northern Burma Allied Forces are so powerful that it is not difficult to capture these strongholds, but it is not easy to hold them.&quot; Heng Kai pointed out that, from the current point of view, the Kokang Allied Forces have won Most of them are only strongholds around the city, and it is difficult to say how much impact they will have on urban jurisdiction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 3, Min Aung Hlaing, the top leader of Myanmar’s military government, warned that the military would launch a counterattack against local ethnic armed groups in Shan State. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The Myanmar National Defense Forces still have overwhelming strength, but since 2021, the Myanmar military government has been attacked on all sides, and even the capital Naypyitaw has been attacked.&quot; Heng Kai analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 1, 2021, Myanmar’s political situation suddenly changed, and state power was transferred to the Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar Defense Forces, Min Aung Hlaing. Some anti-military figures immediately established a national unity government and the People&#39;s Defense Force, took military actions against the National Defense Forces, and took joint actions with local armed forces from time to time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics from the Myanmar Institute for Strategic and Policy Research, in the 21 months from the coup in Myanmar to November 15, 2022, at least 7,855 conflicts broke out across Myanmar. Among them, the military exchanged fire with ethnic minority armed organizations 4,548 times, with the People&#39;s Defense Forces 2,267 times, and the military exchanged fire with ethnic minority armed organizations and the People&#39;s Defense Forces 925 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the northern Myanmar coalition launched the military operation, 14 &quot;revolutionary organizations&quot; across Myanmar have announced their support for &quot;Operation 1027&quot;, and some of them have announced that they will join the fight. According to local media reports in Myanmar, after four consecutive days of offensive, the Kachin Independence Army and the local People&#39;s Defense Force occupied Gaoling Town in Sagaing Province on November 6. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;With the Myanmar military government facing enemies from both sides, it is still difficult to say exactly where the war will go,&quot; Heng Kai said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But for the people in northern Myanmar who have suffered from war, discussing politics may be too far away, and the rice waiting to be harvested in the rice fields is more important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Myanmar has three seasons a year - hot season, rainy season and cool season. Now it is the rainy season rice harvesting season.&quot; Aren said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A farmer in Lashio told local media, &quot;In the past two weeks, it was impossible to harvest rice because of the rain. After the rain stopped, the fighting started. Because the sound of aircraft and weapons was often heard, everyone did not If you dare to go to the fields to harvest, you can only act according to the situation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the interview, Southern Weekend reporters asked many interviewees about their views on this conflict, and the answers they received were almost unanimous. ——No matter who wins, for us people, &quot;peace is the most important thing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (Ajin, Alan, Aren, Zhixiang, and Zou Li are pseudonyms in the article.

After retirement, he joined the Henan Elderly Cultural Development Foundation (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Old Foundation&quot;) and was responsible for collecting private funds from the county. In the eight years he witnessed, people were able to get their principal and interest back as scheduled. Until August 2021, no more money could be withdrawn, and savers began to &quot;visit&quot; every now and then. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At dawn on October 24, 2023, the first guest welcomed into Zhang Shihe’s home was 69-year-old Zhang Fenglan. Six years ago, she deposited the 100,000 yuan she had saved for most of her life into the Lao Foundation and became a &quot;five-star member.&quot; Zhang Shihe is the person in charge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Fenglan’s reminder voucher is not a passbook or an IOU, but two membership certificates. The issuing organization is the Old Foundation. If you deposit money to it, you will receive consolation money, which is interest. In Shangshui County, for every 10,000 yuan saved, you can get 570 yuan/year in consolation payment, with an annualized rate of return of 5.7%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I thought I had saved my money in the safest place, but I never imagined that something like this would happen.” Zhang Fenglan sighed repeatedly to the Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Shihe persuaded the other party in a low voice, saying that he was also a victim and felt very guilty for &quot;losing&quot; everyone&#39;s money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He revealed that the entire Shangshui County involves more than 300 depositors, with a total of more than 41 million yuan in deposits. Looking at the entire Henan Province, the tentacles of the Old Foundation are everywhere. Several insiders of the old foundation revealed to Southern Weekend reporters that the old foundation may absorb as much as 500 million yuan in depositors&#39; funds in Henan Province, involving 18 offices in Zhoukou, Nanyang, Luohe, Luoyang and other cities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 20, 2023, the Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs mentioned in its reply to Li Yazhong and others’ letter of complaint that in June 2020, the Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs transferred Henan Herong Industrial Group Co., Ltd. ( (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Herong Group&quot;) suspected illegal financing-related materials were handed over to the Henan Provincial Public Security Department in the name of the Lao Foundation. The official website of the Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs also records that on July 28, 2020, the Lao Foundation was included in the list of social organizations with serious violations of laws and breach of trust. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many heads of old foundations confirmed to Southern Weekend reporters that under the guidance of the Henan Provincial Public Security Department, public security bureaus in many places have launched investigations into county-level old foundations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In late October, Southern Weekend reporters visited several counties and districts in Zhoukou and Luohe cities and found that the Lao Foundation used local political and private network resources to weave a huge deposit-absorbing network. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How did a provincial public foundation “self-raise” such huge sums of money in the past ten years? Where do these huge sums of money ultimately go? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Network&quot; retired cadres and farmers&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;How to become a veteran foundation member? A &quot;Membership Instructions&quot; found by Southern Weekend reporters states that applicants fill out the membership application form, and after review and approval by the Old Foundation, register information and pay membership fees. After receiving the membership card, they become a formal member. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Shihe said that these membership fees will be returned to members when they expire (one year), and you can also receive consolation money by presenting your membership card to the issuing agency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Membership fees are essentially deposits, and the amount is replaced by points on the membership card. Members are divided into one-star, three-star and five-star, and the corresponding points represent RMB 10,000, RMB 30,000 and RMB 50,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 82-year-old Lu Zhiqiang is a big customer of the old foundation and has 22 membership cards in his hand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He is a retired cadre in Shangshui County.

How many. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He recalled that in the early days of the establishment of the Lao Foundation, Chen Zhihong, the person in charge in Shangshui County, often invited people to have dinner together to promote the Lao Foundation in order to build momentum. As a fellow villager, he even participated once. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Because it is a public foundation, I think there is no problem. Even if you deposit money in a bank for a fixed term, you don&#39;t have much money.&quot; He remembers Chen Zhihong motivating him like this, &quot;This foundation is managed by the Civil Affairs Department, so it can&#39;t be wasted.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Zhiqiang hid the deposits of the old foundation from his children, not even his wife. &quot;If you tell them, they will stop it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guo Fenghua, 77, is the former head of the financial section of the Shangshui County Industrial and Commercial Bureau. She has deposited 250,000 yuan in the old foundation. She only learned about the old foundation through the introduction of a retired cadre from the Shangshui County Civil Affairs Bureau. &quot;I only knew that the interest rates were high and the certificates issued had the seal of the Civil Affairs Department, so I thought it was more reliable.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I didn&#39;t dare to tell my child at that time, for fear of exposing that my child was asking for the money. I wanted to save it so that I could hire a nanny when I get old.&quot; Guo Fenghua sighed, &quot;It&#39;s too late to regret it now. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to retired cadres in the county, the Lao Foundation has also extended its tentacles to the vast rural areas of Henan Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shang Fugui, 70, is from Chengding Village, Guxiang Township, Linying County, Luohe City. He is responsible for helping the Lao Foundation collect deposits in the village. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that at first the villagers saved little money, &quot;but because of the high interest rates, you saw me saving, I saw him saving, and word spread slowly.&quot; Some villagers even offered to give him cigarettes in order to do something for him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He absorbed 2.75 million yuan in funds, involving about 40 depositors, accounting for half of the village&#39;s population. There are also a few savers from other villages who are his relatives. Shang Fugui said that for every 10,000 yuan deposited, depositors can receive a condolence payment of 600 yuan per year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Actually, we are a small bank down there.” A head of the county-level office of the old foundation told a Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Luohe, the old foundation showed the first signs of trouble. In October 2015, the Provincial Lao Foundation said that its funds were broken and gradually stopped local principal and interest payments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shang Fugui recalled that after the payment was stopped, the depositors became enemies with him. Seven years later, in October 2022, he was beaten once by villagers. &quot;Sometimes the tricycles are not dared to be released outside. They will poke holes in you and vent your anger.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every Spring Festival, Shang Fugui and his wife would run to the city. &quot;What if I don&#39;t run away?

In Guzhuang Village, Feng Junfu developed more than 50 villagers into members of the Lao Foundation and collected a total of 1.85 million yuan in savings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Provincial Veterans Foundation stipulates that for every 10,000 yuan taken in, 300 yuan will be set aside for &quot;volunteers&quot; and another 200 yuan will be used for office expenses of the county and district offices. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Origined from the Henan Song Qing Ling Foundation&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Tracing back to the source, the old foundation is inextricably linked to the Henan Soong Ching Ling Foundation (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Henan Song Qing Ling Foundation&quot;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as 2005, the Henan Song Foundation collected deposits from villagers in the name of public welfare medical insurance. (See Southern Weekend’s September 2011 series of reports on “Where is the Money of China’s Most Fundraising Charitable Organization—Who Controls the Henan Soong Ching Ling Foundation”)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2013, the old foundation officially It was established and Lu Dawei was appointed as the president. According to the Henan Provincial People&#39;s Government website, Lu Dawei served as assistant to the governor. In addition, Southern Weekend reporters learned from the Henan Song Foundation website that he is also the vice chairman of the Henan Song Foundation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A county-level person in charge of the old foundation revealed that the management method of the old foundation is under the leadership of the president, with the secretary-general taking responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person in charge told Southern Weekend reporters that Guo Jianxin is the secretary-general of the Old Foundation and is responsible for the overall work, while the deputy secretary-general Huang Yuejun is responsible for specific work. &quot;Huang Yuejun turned out to be from the Song Foundation. Basically, we follow the management style of Song Foundation, otherwise we wouldn’t be able to get this thing done.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In interviews with reporters from Southern Weekend, we found that most of the county-level directors of the old foundations had working experience in the Henan Song Foundation. After the Henan Song Foundation&#39;s savings-absorbing business ceased, Guo Jianxin and Huang Yuejun recruited these people. &quot;In the past, we were all familiar with the business at the Song Foundation. Huang Yuejun gave us advice and introduced us to the old foundation,&quot; the person in charge said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 30, a reporter from Southern Weekend contacted Huang Yuejun by phone. The other party said that he had left the Lao Foundation at the end of 2015 and was currently residing in a nursing home in Sichuan Province. He did not know much about the past and then hung up. Disconnect the phone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Cuiyun was originally a depositor of the Henan Song Foundation. After the Song Foundation ceased its deposit-taking business, she withdrew the original 100,000 yuan from the Song Foundation and transferred it to the old foundation. Then save another 50,000 yuan every year until 450,000 yuan. &quot;Generally (every year) I don&#39;t ask for the principal, I get the interest, but I add some money to make up 50,000 and deposit it again.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Left-hand foundation, right-hand open Company&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Tianyancha shows that the Elderly Foundation is located in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, and its purpose is to &quot;promote the development of social welfare, culture, sports, education and other undertakings for the elderly in Henan Province.&quot; Access to the foundation’s official website is currently closed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters obtained a reply from the Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs on the establishment and registration of the Henan Provincial Elderly Cultural Development Foundation (Yu Min Han [2013] No. 47). According to the &quot;Foundation&quot; According to the provisions of the Management Regulations, after review, the old foundation, which was donated a total of 4 million yuan as the original fund by Guo Jianxin, meets the conditions for establishing a public foundation. It is hereby approved to register and obtain the legal person status of the foundation in accordance with the law. Its business supervisory unit is Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In November 2023, Southern Weekend reporters repeatedly contacted the Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs to verify many issues regarding the old foundation, but no one answered the relevant calls. Inquired through &quot;12345&quot;, but still no reply after waiting for many days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For many savers, they are willing to deposit money in the foundation. On the one hand, they trust the &quot;volunteers&quot;, and on the other hand, they see the business scope on the foundation&#39;s legal person registration certificate. On this certificate issued by the Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, the business scope reads &quot;raising social funds in accordance with the law and carrying out elderly cultural activities such as loving and helping the elderly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of many savers and &quot;volunteers&quot;, being able to &quot;raise social funds in accordance with the law&quot; means that they can legitimately accept deposits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A search shows that many foundations do mention &quot;raising social funds in accordance with the law&quot; in their business scope. For example, the business scope of the Henan Province Yellow River Cultural Foundation is “raising funds in accordance with the law, rescuing cultural heritage, and establishing cultural undertakings”; the business scope of the Henan Province Youth Entrepreneurship and Employment Foundation is “raising funds in accordance with the law, subsidizing youth entrepreneurship and employment, and conducting research on youth entrepreneurship, etc. &quot;Related social charity activities&quot;; the business scope of the Henan Province Old District Construction Foundation is &quot;raising funds in accordance with the law and supporting poverty alleviation&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawyer Zeng Jie of Guangdong Guangqiang Law Firm told Southern Weekend reporters that there is an essential difference between raising funds and deposits. Deposits mean a commitment to guarantee principal and interest. “The foundation can absorb funds from the society within its business scope. However, returns cannot be promised, and projects that repay principal and interest are not allowed.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He explained that deposit business requires a formal banking license. The old foundation used consolation money instead of interest without approval, which is a disguised form of absorbing savings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The business scope on the registration certificate makes depositors and volunteers think it is &quot;natural&quot; to save money here.

(hereinafter referred to as &quot;Herong Group&quot;) bears joint liability for compensation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is the relationship between Herong Group and the Lao Foundation? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the secretary-general of the Lao Foundation, Guo Jianxin is also the chairman of Henan Herong Elderly Care Industry Group and was once the major shareholder of Herong Group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tianyancha shows that Herong Group was established in 2010 and is an enterprise mainly engaged in business services. On March 15, 2010, Guo Jianxin, as the major shareholder, participated in 90% of the shares for the first time. Another shareholder, Wang Shuling, is also a member of the board of directors of the Lao Foundation and holds 10% of the shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;To put it bluntly, Herong Group and the Lao Foundation are one and the same to the outside world, but in reality they are the same.&quot; A person close to Guo Jianxin told Southern Weekend reporters that there are people under the Lao Foundation and Herong Group. Division of labor, top management is a group of people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The registered office address of Herong Group is also the same as that of the Old Foundation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On March 5, 2013, the Lao Foundation and Herong Group officially signed a letter of authorization. The Lao Foundation will authorize Herong Group to invest in projects with the raised funds to ensure the maintenance and appreciation of the funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An investigation by Southern Weekend reporters found that in order to avoid supervision, most of the private funds absorbed by the old foundation went through personal accounts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As can be seen in a criminal verdict, the financial personnel of the Provincial Veterans Foundation are Zhang Xiaodan and Wang Jie. Wang Jie is responsible for receiving funds (resigned in September 2015), and Zhang Xiaodan is responsible for disbursing funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xiaodan mentioned in his testimony that the Provincial Veterans Foundation has bank cards in its offices in various counties and districts. The bank card account names are all the names of provincial and ministerial personnel, and most of the funds are transferred through China Construction Bank. Yes, a small part is transferred through ICBC and Postal Savings Bank of China. After the various offices in the county and district paid dues, Wang Jie transferred the money to the Herong Group&#39;s account. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Wang Jie swiped directly from the POS machine at the foundation headquarters and transferred it to the account given by Herong Group.&quot; Zhang Xiaodan saw Wang Jie transfer like this with his own eyes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xiaodan said that the foundation transfers the dues transferred from each office to Herong Group. &quot;This is the case every day.&quot; Any money received is transferred to the company and transferred to his personal bank card. superior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the available annual reports of the old foundation, from 2014 to 2016, the donation income was 300,000 yuan, 460,000 yuan, and 270,000 yuan respectively, and the corresponding public welfare expenditures were 25,000 yuan. Ten thousand yuan, 220,000 yuan, 360,000 yuan. But by 2017, both donation income and public welfare expenditures were 0. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This means that the huge &quot;membership dues&quot; of the old foundation did not go through the foundation&#39;s public account, but were transferred privately through personal bank accounts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If a lawsuit is filed and we check the public account of the Old Foundation, we will find that there is no money from us in the account. The public account of the Old Foundation only accepts donations. Depositors&#39; money cannot be added to it. Even if it’s a donation,” a county-level head of an old foundation told a Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Huge sums of money flow into real estate&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From a province-wide perspective, the difficulties faced by the old foundation in repaying funds are concentrated in the second half of 2021. But there are early signs of bank-run difficulties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2014, guarantee companies and investment companies in Henan Province went bankrupt on a large scale. &quot;As soon as they closed down, the old foundation was also affected.&quot; An insider close to Guo Jianxin told Southern Weekend reporters that one year after the establishment of the old foundation, the capital chain began to break. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person revealed that from August to September 2015, depositors began to withdraw money from the county offices of the Old Foundation on a large scale. &quot;Not only the customers were panicked, but the directors and volunteers of the Old Foundation offices were also panicked.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person in charge of a county-level office recalled that in October 2015, Guo Jianxin, the head of Herong Group, said at a meeting with county-level leaders that the company had debts and that the funds could not be paid temporarily. , let everyone go back and wait, and protect themselves first. &quot;We didn&#39;t tell the depositors when we got back, thinking it would be fine after a while.&quot; In order to repay the interest to the depositors, we also asked relatives and friends for help, did not hesitate to borrow money, and even sold the house, paying more than 1 million yuan in interest to the depositors. It wasn&#39;t until 2021 that he couldn&#39;t survive anymore, then he confessed to savers and stopped paying interest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There is no way, in order to encourage depositors to continue depositing. If we stop (payment), we will have to go to (jail). Will ordinary people be willing to not pay interest?&quot; The person in charge of the office said that if we continue to do so, Those who went down were paupers and were in debt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 20, 2023, Herong Group issued the &quot;Explanation on the Inability to Redeem the Funds Raised by the Henan Elderly Cultural Foundation on Time&quot;, saying that it held a meeting to study and decide that the payment will be made from the end of February 2023. 10%-15% of the funds will be paid, and 20%-25% of the funds will be paid at the end of February 2024; 30%-35% will be paid in February 2025, and the rest will be paid at the end of 2025. However, the above promises have never been fulfilled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Where did the money go? This is the mystery lingering in the minds of savers and &quot;volunteers&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yi Jiadong is the legal representative of Herong Group. He confessed in a criminal verdict that &quot;Herong Group invested in two real estate projects in Mengzhou City in Jiaozuo and Yuanyang County in Xinxiang , invested in an apartment project for the elderly in Zhengzhou Port District, and also invested in a real estate project in Shangqiu City. All the social funds raised by the Lao Foundation were used in these projects.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, the Zhengzhou Port District project is Herong International Health Care Demonstration Park (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Health Care Park&quot;) is considered to be the benchmark project of Herong Group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public information shows that Kangyangyuan is located at the southwest corner of the intersection of Yingang Avenue and Ruyun Road, Airport District, Zhengzhou City. The total land area is 41,398.22 square meters, the total construction area is 76,754.40 square meters, and there are 2,000 designed beds. It mainly constructs 6 elderly apartment buildings, 1 comprehensive service building, 1 elderly research center building, and 1 elderly medical care center building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Chunlai is the head of a county-level office of the Lao Foundation. On September 15, 2022, he was elected as the director of Kangyangyuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He revealed to Southern Weekend reporters that the elderly care projects in the port area are positioned as high-end and have received the attention of many local leaders. There is a lot of room for imagination in the future. In addition to construction subsidies, bed subsidies, and nursing subsidies, the land price also has advantages compared with other investors. &quot;I heard that the land price in Zhengzhou Port District was more than 2 million yuan per acre, but here it was only a few hundred thousand. At that time, the house price was 10% per year. growth, this alone will not make us lose anything.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, its construction was not smooth. Feng Chunlai said that the construction of Kangyangyuan started in 2016, but due to environmental problems such as dust and noise, the superior authorities asked it to stop construction. It was not until December 18, 2019 that the first phase of the park was successfully opened. According to the Henan branch of CCTV, Lu Dawei and Guo Jianxin also delivered speeches at the opening ceremony. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Chunlai revealed that the main construction of the nine buildings of the senior care project in Zhengzhou Port District was completed in 2018, but due to financial constraints, there has been no renovation. At the beginning of 2019, eight county-level offices under the old foundation established project promotion teams to continue to collect deposits from the society and provide loans to renovate Buildings 5 ​​and 4. The remaining seven buildings have not yet been renovated due to funding problems. &quot;If we don&#39;t renovate the building, this place will collapse long ago.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, about 80 elderly people live in the No. 5 complex. However, as of now, the Kangyangyuan has not yet been inspected and has not obtained a business license. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Multiple people familiar with the matter confirmed to Southern Weekend reporters that in the second half of 2022, Guo Jianxin and several company managers were arrested by the public security organs for involvement in other cases. Subsequently, the offices of the Old Foundation and Herong Group were moved from No. 8 Shangdu Road, Zhengdong New District to Kangyangyuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Now almost no one is working in the Old Foundation and Herong Group. They come if they have something to do, but they don&#39;t come if there is nothing. They basically go back to their homes.&quot; An insider of the Old Foundation said that No. 5 in Kangyang Garden The second floor of the complex building was originally the office space of the bosses, but now it is hard to find anyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 30, a reporter from Southern Weekend contacted an external relations director of Herong Group as an investor. He said that Kangyangyuan currently still has debts of more than 200 million yuan, of which the construction work is in arrears. The team&#39;s project payment is less than 100 million yuan, and the other more than 100 million yuan is funds collected from some elderly customers before the epidemic and needs to be refunded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Chunlai said that Kangyangyuan currently has 30 employees and spends 200,000 to 300,000 yuan a month. The largest expense is water and electricity bills. Although we can collect 3,700 yuan per month from each elderly person, &quot;it&#39;s basically not enough, and we are trying every means to delay and owe money.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Can this retirement apartment make money to replenish the principal of the old foundation’s depositors? They can&#39;t think that far ahead. At the moment, the operations here are barely surviving on the money of the elderly living in retirement apartments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(At the request of the interviewee, Zhang Shihe, Zhang Fenglan, Lu Zhiqiang, Guo Fenghua, and Liu Cuiyun are pseudonyms in the article.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[消失的课间十分钟，学校何以成樊笼：“绝对安全”发生学丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260132]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In response to the &quot;disappearing ten minutes between classes&quot; for primary and secondary school students in some places, the Ministry of Education stated that it will resolutely correct it to &quot;ensure The practice of simply restricting students’ necessary recess and activities on the grounds of “student safety”. Subsequently, some schools began to respond, such as media reports: The bell rang, and Dang Xinlong, the vice principal of Shanhaitian Experimental Primary School in Rizhao, Shandong Province, kicked out the students who were still in the classroom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this chronic disease has been infiltrated for a long time, is widespread and deep, and I am afraid it cannot be cured by a single statement. Article 8 of the &quot;School Protection Regulations for Minors&quot; that will be implemented on September 1, 2021: Schools shall not set up management measures that infringe on students&#39; personal freedom, and shall not impose any restrictions on students&#39; legitimate communication, games, or activities during recess and other non-teaching time. Unnecessary restrictions are placed on freedom of speech and behavior such as classroom activities. The target is the &quot;disappeared ten minutes between classes&quot;. The problem is that it is difficult for students to make their own decisions. No school believes that it is &quot;unnecessary&quot; to restrict students from leaving the classroom, the teaching building, and the playground during recess. So, the problem remains to be solved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beiqing.com recently reported that a parent said: If children want to leave the classroom during recess, they can basically only go to the toilet and get water. They are not allowed to talk loudly or run or jump on the way; some &quot;loose&quot; schools , the child will be allowed to walk in the corridor and cannot go up or down stairs or to the playground; in more serious cases, the child can only stay in the corridor of his own group and cannot cross the boundary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another media reported in July this year that in Beijing, primary schools generally strictly limit the scope and intensity of students’ recess activities. The reporter randomly visited 27 schools in the central city and found that at least more than 20 schools have strict restrictions on students’ recess activities. restrictions on activities during the period. In addition, some schools in Zhengzhou, Henan, Baoding, Hebei and other places have adopted similar regulations, including not being allowed to leave the teaching building, not leaving the classroom, and not allowed to speak loudly or play around inside or outside the classroom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was a child born in the 70s and 80s, I could go out for ten minutes between classes to skip rope, play shuttlecock, hopscotch, play freely and even chase each other, letting go of my nature; outdoors, in the playground, be quiet or active No matter what, it is always suitable, with the blue sky above your head, your feet on the earth, let the sun hit your face, let the breeze blow on your face, and be close to nature, which can instantly rejuvenate and heal the body and mind, and also cultivate simple, strong and resilient character and values. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And now, while restricting or even prohibiting children from leaving the classroom, leaving the teaching building, or going to the playground for even ten minutes between classes, they still naively ask: Why are our children so mentally fragile? Why are our boys so fragile? A general lack of masculinity? Isn&#39;t this funny? How can we become strong physically and mentally if we are not even allowed to chase, play and fight? Where does masculinity come from? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How did this distorted philosophy and practice come to be? On June 1, 2021, the Director of the Department of Physical Health and Art Education of the Ministry of Education responded to CCTV: &quot;We are afraid that students will be easily injured once they move. Now all schools put safety first... This can also be said to be a failure to eat due to choking. .&quot; Viewed in this way, the pursuit of &quot;absolute safety&quot; and its mechanism are worthy of analysis and reflection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, some parents have problems and believe that the school should be responsible for any personal injury to their children while in school. This imposes unlimited liability on the school. Not to mention that schools can’t do it, parents themselves can’t do it either. Theoretically, there is no one in the world who is more concerned about the safety of their children than parents, but under the care of parents, there are endless incidents of children being injured or even killed. No one wants to see something like this happen, but the world itself contains various known and unknown risks, and we cannot make anti-human demands on schools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, identifying risks, preventing risks, responding to risks, and coexisting with risks are an integral part of everyone&#39;s life, and they are also the basic education that every child must learn to grow up. Very young children do not know what risks are. Of course, they must be kept away from risks and isolated as much as possible. However, children are constantly growing and need to learn the skills to identify, prevent and respond to risks as they grow. This is the most important survival skills education. In a way, it is much more important than knowledge education. And so many schools actually succumb to the ideas of some parents of students and strive to build schools into an absolutely safe space that is isolated from any risks. To this end, they do not hesitate to suppress children&#39;s love of freedom and love of play. This is anti-education in itself and also In vain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, there will always be some weird parents who want to blackmail the school financially when their child has an accident at school, even though it is clearly not the school’s responsibility. But this is not the crux of the problem. The key lies in how schools, education authorities, public prosecutors and law respond. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If these three parties can handle the matter according to its merits and legal principles, it will not be the responsibility of the school. The school will not shoulder the responsibility, and the school will not let the school shoulder the responsibility. He Xini will resolutely fight back those who mess around. In this way, righteousness can rise and decent values ​​and correct incentives can be established. Does the school still need to engage in &quot;absolute security&quot; that is anti-education and anti-human? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously it was not the school’s responsibility, but due to the parents’ unreasonable fuss, the school had to compensate the loss on its own or under the pressure of superior departments. This is a bad incentive for some parents who have evil intentions or like to shirk responsibility. In order to avoid another hemorrhage, the logical approach for schools and education authorities is to restrict children&#39;s freedom of movement, confine them to the smallest possible space, and approach the &quot;absolute safety&quot; that isolates all risks. This is the root of the problem. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To a certain extent, this is a social issue and a conceptual issue: children who cry have milk to drink. Whoever has a louder voice and can make more noise will get greater benefits. This phenomenon is still prevalent in public opinion and in all walks of life. &quot;I am weak and I am reasonable&quot;, &quot;I am making trouble and I am justified&quot; and &quot;I am loud and I am justified&quot; have become unspoken rules. Pretending to be weak, being miserable, and using the weak to bully the strong has created another jungle. The children locked up in the classroom are just another group of victims of this jungle law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 11:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[记者节之思：新闻理想的坚守与开拓]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260074]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The annual Journalists’ Day is here. This is also the time for reporters who are working non-stop and running around all year round to stop and reflect. , an important moment for self-examination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today&#39;s world is full of chaos, the century-old changes are accelerating, the media field is deeply integrated and reconstructed, instability and uncertainty factors are significantly increasing, internal and external factors are stirring in the hearts of journalists... At this moment, Journalists&#39; Day, Perhaps each of us journalists should ask themselves the question: Do you still have journalistic ideals? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a journalist, the news ideal is the &quot;beacon light&quot; that guides the direction; the news ideal is the &quot;engine&quot; that drives forward; the news ideal is the &quot;ballast&quot; &quot;Stone&quot; has the function of calming the mind; news ideal is the &quot;regulator&quot; and has the function of prompting and warning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, today, the traditional journalism industry is facing an unprecedented industry shock: the circulation of newspapers and periodicals and radio and television ratings have declined, and the influence of the media has declined; the media industry has operating difficulties, and the income of news practitioners has decreased. ; The number of people leaving their jobs has increased, and people quitting the industry have been heard from time to time; the number of enrollment in journalism and communication majors in colleges and universities has been reduced, and the employment situation of graduates has become tighter... There is no shortage of comments on the Internet about candidates who plan to apply for the journalism and communication major. Although it is not without bias, This is by no means groundless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the founding words of &quot;Xiangjiang Review&quot;, Mao Zedong enthusiastically asked: &quot;What is the biggest problem in the world? The biggest problem is the problem of food.&quot; When the traditional journalism industry is climbing up and over the hurdles, a group of people who are confused and emotionally anxious have emerged. Psychological Inevitability – Will Traditional Journalism Die? Is there a future for journalism? Do we still need journalistic ideals? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As long as we carefully study the history, reality and future development trends of journalism, we will find that traditional journalism will not disappear. Journalism still has its own future, and we still need journalistic ideals. This is because: From the perspective of the origin of journalism, news originates from people’s curiosity. As long as people’s curiosity does not die, journalism will not disappear. From the perspective of the evolution of journalism, although the carrier of news is constantly changing, the functional role of journalism has not disappeared. However, compared with the traditional ways of reading newspapers, listening to radio, and watching TV in the past, people now obtain news in a different way. It’s just a new carrier such as a mobile phone. From the perspective of audience needs, news focuses on meeting people&#39;s communication needs. As long as people&#39;s communication needs exist, the demand for journalism will always exist. From the perspective of journalism production, the authoritative news, in-depth reports, news reviews, elegant programs and other products provided by traditional media cannot be replaced by the vast number of new media and self-media. Therefore, traditional journalism is unlikely to disappear in any of the above senses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since it is impossible for traditional journalism to disappear, it is impossible for journalists to disappear. The ideal of journalism will inevitably accompany and advance together with journalists. Otherwise, we will lose our way and lose our way. Without motivation, lack of soul, and chaos, you will be at a loss, useless, muddle along, and do nothing. Therefore, in such a special context of the times, each of us journalists must still have journalistic ideals in mind, promote journalistic ideals, adhere to journalistic ideals, and practice journalistic ideals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Always have a loyal heart. Loyalty means that as a journalist, don’t ask what the country has done for me, but ask what I have done for the country; loyalty means not being confused in the face of major events, not wavering at critical moments, and being able to withstand various complex situations and problems. The test; loyalty means being indifferent to fame and wealth, willing to work as a coolie, working hard, sweating, and traveling thousands of miles for the cause of journalism, and striving to become an excellent journalist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Always maintain a keen sense. Sensitivity is an essential quality for professional journalists. Only journalists who are sharp-minded, have unique vision, are good at seeing the subtleties, respond quickly, and have a sharp eye can effectively improve the dissemination, guidance, influence and credibility of news and public opinion work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We must always practice seeking truth. The world-famous journalist Farage once said: &quot;The duty of a reporter is to reveal the truth.&quot; In an era of widespread media communication, despite the excess of news information, real news is always valuable. We should always maintain the spirit of truth-seeking, practice truth-seeking skills, and provide the public with truth, true knowledge, true feelings, and truth in a timely and rapid manner in the turbulent world of massive information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Always hold the ruler of justice. Some people say: &quot;The reporter&#39;s pen contains countless fortunes, reputation and reputation, loyalty and villainy, right and wrong, and life and death.&quot; This shows how heavy the journalist&#39;s pen is. Therefore, we reporters should be very clear about why we write, what we write, how we write, and to what extent we write. We must always grasp the yardstick of &quot;fairness&quot; and must not be influenced by some kind of power, money, or interest relationship. Those pens soaked in grease and booze can&#39;t possibly do them justice. This is why we need to always be in awe of &quot;justice&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the occasion of Journalists’ Day, I wish every journalist’s journalistic ideals to be evergreen and never wither! &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is from the media in Hebei)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;span>; 163.com)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 10:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[森林消防“全覆盖”31个省份]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260136]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;(On the morning of November 7, 2023, the State Council Information Office held a press conference to introduce Progress in the reform of the fire rescue system.

Li Shangyu, head of the Education and Training Department of the Ministry of Emergency Management, said that there was a plan to recruit 15,000 people in 2023, but nearly 110,000 people signed up, marking the fourth consecutive full recruitment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Shangyu introduced that the average age of new firefighters is 21.8 years old, and 52.6% have a college degree or above. They are currently undergoing a one-year induction training. So far, the total number of firefighters recruited after the transformation has reached more than 94,000, accounting for 65.3% of the total number of existing firefighters. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Forest firefighting adds more than 8,200 people&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;National firefighting After the rescue bureau was officially established, a new mobile team was formed. Xu Zhongshun, deputy director of the National Fire and Rescue Bureau, said that this is &quot;a major decision made based on the basic national conditions of my country&#39;s frequent natural disasters.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Xu Zhongshun said that as a critical force in national emergencies and major disasters, the mobile team is mainly responsible for forest and grassland firefighting duties, supplemented by flood fighting and earthquake and geological disaster rescue. Responsibilities, task arrangements focus on fire fighting in winter and spring, flood control in summer and autumn, year-round disaster relief, seasonal cross-regional garrison, and implementation of preparatory operations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The National Fire and Rescue Administration has integrated the forest fire corps and related fire and rescue mobile detachments, forming 10 cross-regional fire and rescue mobile corps and several detachments, brigades, and squadrons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Among them, the original establishment of forest firefighting teams is 25,000, mainly deployed in 10 provinces including Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Fujian, and Sichuan.

The employees or students of the institute are those who come to the institute for further study from other places and have returned to work in their original units. No current student in this laboratory has contracted cancer. The specific situation is as follows: &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Huang, female, studied for a doctoral degree in our hospital from 2017 to 2022, during which she studied in the laboratory of the Breast Cancer Center, and graduated with a doctoral degree in July 2022 Later, he joined the Breast Surgery Department of our hospital and engaged in clinical work.

Another researcher is a doctoral student who graduated from a foreign hospital. In 2021, he came to our hospital for a year of further study and worked in the laboratory of the Breast Tumor Center. He completed his further study in April 2022 and left Guangzhou. In 2023, he was diagnosed with breast cancer at his place of work. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The Breast Cancer Center Laboratory was opened in 2009 and has trained more than 200 students so far.

The houses with blue roofs in the distance are in Myanmar. Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the fifth day of the civil war in northern Myanmar, Wu Xia, who lives in the border town of Wanding, was so scared when she heard the sound of gunfire not far away that she turned off the iron Snack bar, hiding in a home made of reinforced concrete. Having lived in Wanding for more than 20 years, she told the Southern Weekend reporter that there had been wars on the opposite side before, with mostly gunshots, but the fighting in 2023 was the most fierce, all with heavy shelling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Xia climbed to the roof of her house, where she could see Myanmar across the river. In a 39-second video she shot, the sound of gunfire and artillery continued from the valley, and helicopters circled the top of the mountain. At the foot of the mountain were dense houses, stretching from Myanmar to the eastern town of Ruili City, Yunnan Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 27, 2023, government army strongholds in many places in northern Myanmar were attacked by armed forces and exchanges of fire broke out. The fighting was fierce and the stalemate has continued to this day. On the national border, Wanding Town, which borders Bangsai Town in Myanmar, is a Chinese town that has been greatly affected by the war. Stray bullets have fallen into this town of about 10,000 people many times. In order to ensure the safety of residents, the local government arranged for school closures and mobilized residents to leave the town to avoid the war. The town implemented a &quot;only exit, no entry&quot; control policy, and even the town government staff evacuated to work in safe places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Wanding Town is located on the border of China and Myanmar.

Drawing by Liang Shuyi&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Don’t come out of your home”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the morning of October 28, a shell from Myanmar hit a residential building in Wanding Town, destroying the top four floors. A big hole was blown out of the building. A few hours after the explosion, Mr. Yang, who sells aluminum doors and windows, rushed to the scene out of curiosity. He told Southern Weekend reporters that the shell had exploded and there were no casualties. “An old lady told me that when the shell exploded, It was so shaken that she couldn&#39;t hear anything for two hours.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Peng Qi first heard the sound of shells and gunshots, she didn&#39;t know what they were. She thought someone was setting off fireworks. In June 2023, she was transferred from Ruili City to Wanding Town and worked as a store manager in a chain milk tea shop. The locals told her that it was the sound of war in Myanmar and comforted her: &quot;It&#39;s okay, we hear this sound every year.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The locals who are used to the sound of gunfire seem to be also attracted by it. This time the battle was frightening. At two or three o&#39;clock in the morning on October 29, Wu Xia was awakened by several gunshots while she was sleeping. That day, she listened to the sound of gunfire outside and judged that the exchange of fire between the two parties was fierce. The windows of a house about 200 meters away from her home were shattered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wuxia Snack Shop sells some local specialty snacks, such as Pauluda, fried bait cubes, etc. It is only about 200 meters away from Wanding Port. Children in the third grade of primary school are afraid that artillery shells will penetrate the iron sheet and will go home when they hear the sound of artillery fire. Wu Xia believes that hiding at home is not necessarily safe. &quot;If there are really shells coming, you can&#39;t hide anywhere.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tao Wan, who lives by the boundary river, seems to be at greater risk. She once saw a picture of a helicopter bombing on the other side of the river on a short video platform. The community administrator also kept telling her not to come out of the house. However, She works at Wanding Town Health Center and still needs to report to work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tao Wan recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that on October 31, she was at work when she was suddenly informed that a large crater had been blown up near her home, and her son, who was in primary school, was staying at home alone. &quot;It was really urgent at the time. I called my husband and ran home. When I got home and opened the door, I saw that my son was taking a nap.&quot; Tao Wan looked at her son sleeping soundly and felt, &quot;My heart is going to be broken.&quot; &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tao Wan told Southern Weekend reporters that when she was a child, the sound of fighting on the other side of the river could be heard in Wanding Town. The most intense year.&quot; The scene of community workers and street broadcasts telling residents to retreat and avoid the fighting made Tao Wan feel panic like never before, &quot;I felt like I had to leave this home.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many interviewees told Southern Weekend reporters that on October 27, the night when the war broke out, community members came to persuade them to leave: “If you have family and friends in Ruili, go to Ruili. &quot;Not only that, the community also informed that if you hear the sound of gunfire, please do not go out, and immediately find shelter to take shelter. Do not wait and see out of curiosity, and avoid exposing your body in open spaces to avoid being hit by stray bullets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 3, an on-duty staff member of the Wanding Town Government told Southern Weekend reporters that the staff in the government building had moved to a relatively safe place to work, leaving only a few on-duty staff, and the new place was still open. Within the Wanding area, it is five or six kilometers away from the town government building. The reason why they moved out of the town government building was because the building was &quot;directly opposite Myanmar and posed a major safety hazard.&quot; The person on duty said he was unclear about how many people were transferred in Wanding Town and when students would resume classes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The fourth floor of a residential building in the town was hit by a shell, but fortunately there were no casualties.

In addition to the fierce gunfire, there were also Students are completely suspended from classes. The milk tea shop where Peng Qi works is only a few hundred meters away from Wanding Middle School. She discovered that on the evening of Friday, October 27, all the high school students who were originally on holiday on Sunday were taken home by their parents. Wu Xia&#39;s snack bar is not far from the middle school. She saw many parents driving to the school gate to pick up their students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cai Lili, a 21-year-old girl who grew up in Wanding, recalled that there was an emergency in the local area a few years ago when classes were suspended due to the war in Myanmar, but she could not remember the time clearly. She only remembered that it was the same time at that time. There are stray bullets flying into the territory. &quot;The most serious thing in recent years is the two incidents of stray bullets flying over. The situation in Myanmar has always been unstable. Once war starts, Wanding&#39;s geographical location is destined to be affected.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Cai In Lily&#39;s impression, there is only a boundary river two or three meters wide, and there are frequent exchanges between Wanding and the Myanmar town of Bangsai on the other side. She recalled that when she was five or six years old, it was easy to travel to Myanmar from the border crossing. When she was in primary school, seven or eight of the more than 40 students in her class were from Myanmar. &quot;We all studied Chinese courses and we all played together.&quot; The boundary river is also one of her recreational areas. She often goes fishing and picnicking by the river with her family and friends. A walking trail is built close to the boundary river, and Wanding residents often go for walks by the river. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tao Wan confirmed to Southern Weekend reporters that some Wanding residents were indeed accidentally injured, mostly with skin injuries. &quot;After we debridement, we will ask them to go home quickly, because the hospital is located on a relatively high ground and is not safe. Some people were also transferred to higher-level hospitals by ambulances.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Xia discovered that since the beginning of the Northern Myanmar War Later, there were fewer and fewer people on the streets, especially tourists. As a famous border town and border port, there are endless tourists here all year round. Her snack bar is not far from the national gate and has about a hundred customers every day. But after the war broke out, only a few old customers who lived nearby came to the store, and &quot;there was no one on this street.&quot; Not only that, on October 30, the &quot;only go out, no go in&quot; rule was implemented in the central area of ​​Wanding Town. However, according to locals, the rule was only implemented for two days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Peng Qi also obviously felt that the flow of people had dropped sharply. In an interview with a Southern Weekend reporter at 16:00 on November 2, Peng Qi said that the store&#39;s turnover that day was only more than 100 yuan, which is the price of about 10 cups of milk tea, and most of the customers were from nearby shops. Before the war, the store&#39;s daily turnover was about one thousand yuan. There are also brave tourists who go to the border to shoot short videos. Wu Xia said: &quot;Many men and women may also be afraid. They basically just take pictures and leave.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the men and women Wu Xia saw, Perhaps there is also Zhou Feng, a melon seller. On November 2, 37-year-old Zhou Feng also visited the national gate of Wanding, but his destination was the Wanding Watermelon Wholesale Market. As the largest watermelon market in Southeast Asia, from the end of October to May of the following year is the time when Myanmar watermelons are on the market and exported to China. Zhou Feng revealed that during peak periods, the market could have 1,000 vehicles a day, each carrying 16 tons of watermelons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of October 2023, the price of Myanmar watermelon that has just been launched can reach four or five yuan per kilogram, which is not low. After the war broke out, Wanding&#39;s national gate was closed and watermelon could not enter the territory. Zhou Feng analyzed that the most affected people in the watermelon industry chain are melon farmers. The price of contracted land in Myanmar is relatively low, only three to four hundred yuan per mu, so most of the people who plant watermelons on contracted land in Myanmar are Chinese. Zhou Feng has been engaged in this industry for 13 years. He is grateful that it is the early stage of the watermelon market. &quot;If it takes more than a month to start the war, I will be annoyed.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;In previous years, at the Wanding Watermelon Wholesale Market, melon stalls were filled with watermelons imported from Myanmar.

Guo Yu runs a B&amp;B. Since the war started, there have been no guests staying. Fortunately, the shells did not fall near them, and the family&#39;s food, clothing, housing and transportation were not affected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guo Yu’s mother is from Myanmar, and his father’s ancestral home is in Baoshan City, Yunnan Province. When they were young, they came to Wanding to buy land and build a house, and settled here. Guo Yu told Southern Weekend reporters that his grandmother&#39;s house was not affected by the war and was relatively safe for the time being. Guo Yu also feels safe and has no plans to move away.
