The main venue of the World Science Fiction Convention. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of Chengdu Pidu District Science and Technology Innovation City Management Committee/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main venue of the 81st World Science Fiction Convention in 2023 ——Chengdu Science Fiction Museum is located in the center of a two-kilometer radius area called &quot;Science Fiction Avenue&quot;. When Chengdu&#39;s bid to host the event was successful two years ago, it was still a wilderness. This plot of land in Pidu District, Chengdu, which was originally planned as a &quot;Science and Technology Museum&quot;, was quickly upgraded to a &quot;Science Fiction Museum&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This science fiction pavilion designed by Zaha Hadid Architects continues its pursuit of curves and a sense of the future. In the jungle of horizontal and vertical straight lines in the suburbs, several artificially shaped curved surfaces are implanted. According to the official statement, it was a nebula from the universe, but science fiction writer Liu Cixin said that it also looked like an alien spacecraft that landed on the lakeside. Anyway, this is the World Science Fiction Convention and it needs a visual imagery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the first time that the World Science Fiction Convention has come to China. Initially, the World Science Fiction Convention was just a whim created by a few young people under the age of 20 in Chicago, USA - to create a gathering platform for science fiction fans around the world. In 1939, they held their first convention in Chicago. Through gatherings and autonomy of science fiction fans, people from all over the world who like a certain science fiction work gather together to chat about their reading experiences, exchange handicrafts, and commemorate the dead of science fiction... For eighty years, the World Science Fiction Convention has inherited such a loose and rich tradition The gene of imagination has grown a unique and lasting science fiction culture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Entering the Chengdu Science Fiction Museum through the huge dome-style entrance requires you to go through multiple security checks. The opening ceremony showed some common elements of a Chinese-style evening party - the host&#39;s high-pitched recitation, the colorful stage, and the group dances that filled the space. However, the organizers added as many science fiction elements as possible to highlight the conference&#39;s atmosphere. The theme is &quot;The Era of Symbiosis&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;China&#39;s science fiction fan culture has not had extensive exchanges with the culture I was exposed to when I grew up for decades. I still have many things to learn beyond my previous experience.&quot; Co-chairman of this conference Ben Yarrow said, &quot;Of course, Chinese science fiction fans also have a lot to know about the culture of the World Science Fiction Convention.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Member Culture&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Chengdu in late October The chill has already set in, and the summer vacation for students has passed early. When Chengdu applied to host the World Science Fiction Convention in 2021, many student science fiction fans spent money to register as members of the 79th Washington World Science Fiction Convention (approximately more than 600 yuan) to vote for Chengdu in order to see the science fiction event during the summer vacation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;World Science Fiction Association Constitution&quot;, various memberships with different titles can be purchased. If you purchase the membership for the current year, you can vote for the city that will bid for the next two years, and you can also vote for the Hugo Award. Vote for the shortlisted works. This approach is similar to &quot;crowdfunding&quot;. The vast majority of the budget of previous World Science Fiction Conventions comes from the purchase support of members. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a unique membership culture among science fiction fans in the world. In the 1950s, soon after the Hugo Awards were established, fan awards were added. Science fiction fans who wrote their own works and amateur magazines could also stand on the podium of the Hugo Awards and compete with those &quot;big names&quot; The works complement each other. The three traditional core issues of the World Science Fiction Convention - Hugo Award voting, business meetings and future conference site selection votes - are all closely related to the participation of ordinary science fiction fans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Its charm lies in that it is a spirit based on a community of creators. Everyone is both a participant and a creator. This is something given to it by cultural traditions and cannot be replaced or replaced casually. Copied.&quot; Chen Shi, co-chairman of this conference, told Southern Weekend reporters that he regretted that for many fantasy fans, this was a conference that they could not reach. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On January 20, 2023, the Chengdu Organizing Committee announced on Twitter that the date of the event would be postponed from August 16, 2023 to October 18. &quot;At least a hundred of my psychedelic friends can&#39;t come,&quot; said Qianxing, a college student. His school is far away from Chengdu, and he is one of the few people who can take leave. Qianxing came to the venue wearing a silver-blue cosplay costume, which was very conspicuous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If these fantasy fans can come to the Chengdu Science Fiction Museum, in this huge, hollow building, they will first see a 9-meter-high giant &quot;Benben&quot; statue in the hall (movie The robot in &quot;The Wandering Earth&quot;), at night, the spotlights surrounding it make the colors on its surface begin to flow, creating &quot;clumsy&quot; in various states. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two large exhibition halls on the first floor are the enterprise exhibition hall and the science fiction fan exhibition hall. Most of the dozens of booths in the corporate exhibition hall are Chinese companies. Some sell science fiction cultural creations, some make projections, and more are engaged in science fiction publishing. The sound and light effects of their booth are eye-catching, which is obviously different from the psychedelic exhibition area next to it. The corporate exhibition hall is a unit that has never been seen in previous World Science Fiction Conventions. The support of the government, the participation of enterprises, and the brand promotion of a large number of sponsors have given the conference more official color and commercial value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The vicinity of the Science Fiction Hall cannot meet the travel and catering needs of so many exhibitors. An exhibitor told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;What kind of tickets should be used, how to arrange the buses, and how to distribute the agenda&quot; were all figured out after coming here; there are still very few businesses around this brand-new venue. If you don&#39;t want to To eat at the venue&#39;s restaurants, such as KFC and Subway, you have to go several kilometers away to find food at noon every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the coolness of the corporate exhibition area, the science fiction fan exhibition area looks much simpler. A table, a flag, an introduction card or a QR code. They come from university clubs, foreign science fiction organizations, and unfamous amateur authors... It&#39;s a bit like a recruitment scene for university clubs. On the table of the Tibetan science fiction club, there are Tibetan science fiction works published over the years. A Tibetan young man patiently introduced the history of Tibetan science fiction to curious onlookers. This kind of atmosphere is more like the previous World Science Fiction Convention. Science fiction literature research scholar Yan Feng once participated in the 2019 World Science Fiction Convention in Dublin. He recalled that the atmosphere there was &quot;free and loose.&quot; He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The conference rooms on the second and third floors of the Science Fiction Museum are used to hold various &quot;salons&quot;. The so-called &quot;salons&quot; are various seminars organized by science fiction fans themselves. Science fiction fans invite their own guests and choose their own topics. After submitting the submission to the organizing committee, it is usually approved. Then the organizing committee arranges the time and venue and does not interfere with other matters. The number of salon sessions at previous World Science Fiction Conventions has been stable between three and four hundred. There were more than 400 salons registered for the Chengdu World Science Fiction Convention, and more than 230 salons were eventually reserved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This time the Chengdu Organizing Committee invited a total of more than 600 guests, including more than 180 overseas guests (more than 150 people were present), who formed the main group of the salon. In the past World Science Fiction Convention, only a small number of officially invited guests were invited by science fiction fans themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Shi also applied for a salon at the World Science Fiction Convention in Chicago. &quot;I just bring a form, and the organizing committee directly tells me the location and time. You can just do it yourself, and they won&#39;t care about you.&quot; Chen Shi said, &quot;In China&#39;s cultural background, this may not be the case. Suitable.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The foreign World Science Fiction Convention is very attractive to the fantasy fandom, but if you don&#39;t leave the fandom, their core members are more than 20,000, and the number of people who come every year does not change much. It has formed its own community culture. There are cultural thresholds to enter this community. If we completely copy that, it may be very miserable. It is difficult for this thing to enter various circles.&quot; When Chen Shi first thought about what to do At some kind of world science fiction conference, he had already decided to take a different path. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Feng is the CEO of the science fiction publishing company Baguangfen. The &quot;Oral History of Chinese Science Fiction&quot; she edited was also shortlisted for the 2023 Hugo Award. She has participated in several World Science Fiction Conventions. She recalled the previous salons and exhibitions to Southern Weekend reporters, “It was like a party for science fiction fans, with not many ‘high-end’ designs and full of various cosplayers (two-dimensional image imitators). When walking around the market, there are also people who gather in a small circle and play guitar all day long.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What makes her linger here is the former flea market. Every year, science fiction fans sell their collections, handicrafts, The second-hand books were auctioned at the flea market at the World Science Fiction Convention. Everyone wrote their desired price on a small sign, and the one with the highest price got it. &quot;Almost every time I take pictures at the convention, I get something I like.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Business Meeting&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;of&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;query, debate&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;and&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;voting&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Hello, your speech is not related to the question of yes or no, but another topic.&quot; &quot;Hello, your time to speak is up.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;Qianxing’s speech was interrupted from time to time by the timekeeper on the podium. This is Qianxing&#39;s first time at the World Science Fiction Convention, and like most Chinese science fiction fans, it is his first time to experience an affairs conference. Many Chinese science fiction fans hang out in exhibition areas and salons, but often ignore this important meeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But old science fiction fans all know that &quot;only by attending business meetings can you have a deep understanding of the organization and participation methods of the World Science Fiction Association and the World Science Fiction Convention, and you will feel some interesting things.&quot; place.&quot; Chen Shi said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Business Meeting&quot; is an important agenda of every conference, even the core agenda. During this four-to-five-day meeting, members supervised various affairs of the World Science Fiction Congress through questioning, debate, and voting, and were also responsible for revising certain provisions of the World Science Fiction Association Charter, the cornerstone of the World Science Fiction Congress. . In English, this charter is called a constitution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The practice of this conference seems new and even a bit exciting to most Chinese science fiction fans. &quot;What is a sunset clause?&quot; When they encounter legal terms they don&#39;t understand, they will express them candidly on the spot. Their questions are listened to carefully by people from all over the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you have personally experienced the process and debate of the business meeting, it is not difficult to understand why the fandom calls the meeting a &quot;constitutional amendment meeting.&quot; The business meetings of the Chengdu World Science Fiction Convention are held in the Meteor Hall of the Science Fiction Hall, which is a small hall independent of the main hall. People with membership can enter to listen, express opinions and vote at any time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qianxing is the most active speaker among the Chinese members present. He has to express his own opinions on almost every topic. When he gets selfless, he often exceeds the speaking time and is asked to stop speaking. This is A meeting in which speeches and debates were conducted strictly in accordance with Robert&#39;s Rules of Order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There are fewer people coming this year, but it was more lively in previous years.” Xixia, director of Baguangfen Film and Television, told Southern Weekend reporters. There will be a preparatory meeting before the annual business meeting to discuss the specific arrangements for the business meeting. The preparatory meetings in previous years were also very lively. Often within a few minutes of the host&#39;s speech, a member would jump out and question various arrangements. &quot;Some people said how many translators should be provided, and some people said how the screen should be displayed. In the end, both sides debated Do you want to start the two-minute preparatory meeting?&quot; Chen Shi recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the small number of people coming, Deputy Adjudicator Kevin Stanley revealed to Chen Shi that 2023 should be the year with the least &quot;wrangling&quot; in the preparatory meeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Meteor Hall is far from full. There are two thick books at the door, the Chinese and English versions of &quot;Robert&#39;s Rules of Procedure&quot;. If members have any opinions on the debate process, they can check it at any time. Xixia brought his own &quot;Constitutional Amendment&quot; this time. He wants to add a Hugo Award to be awarded to science fiction films produced by independent filmmakers. He believes that the current &quot;Best Dramatic Performance (Feature Film)&quot; The awards pay too much attention to commercial blockbusters and ignore independent films. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most fantasy fans in the 1950s were fans of science fiction novels, so the first Hugo Award was established for the best novel in 1953. Since then, fan magazines and theater performances have been slowly added. and comics awards. If you look at the award-winning films over the years, you will find that most of them are Hollywood commercial productions. Xixia believes that it is necessary to change this situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“For example, in terms of novel awards, we have already awarded awards to the most commercially successful and famous novels, but there are also some fan-created novels that have not received commercial attention but are considered well-written by the industry. For very good novels, the Hugo Awards will award them with Best Fan Author, Best Fan Magazine, and Best Fan Podcast. There should also be such an award in the film category,&quot; Xixia said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It will take at least two years to pass new amendments at the &quot;Constitutional Amendment Conference&quot;. If the proposal can be debated and passed at the first year&#39;s conference, it will become a formal amendment proposal. It will be debated for a second time in the second year. Only after it is passed can the &quot;constitutional amendment&quot; be considered successful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are two proposals for second-instance debate in 2023, one of which is &quot;whether to add a Hugo Award for the best game or interactive work.&quot; The Chinese members present seemed to be generally cautious about this proposal. They questioned the definition of &quot;game&quot;, especially since the boundaries of science fiction games seemed not to be clear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The debate time is over. Those who support this proposal please stand up...those who oppose this proposal please stand up...&quot; Adjudicator Donald Eastlake said. The final voting result was 10:3, and the amendment was passed, which means that this award will be added to the Hugo Awards in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qianxing’s most exciting speech was about a new proposal for 2023. This new proposal put forward by Kevin Stanley calls for the future World Science Fiction Convention to be held preferably between August 1 and September 30. If it exceeds this range, it should be held with the next one. Negotiations with the host city. Qianxing’s opinion is that in addition to negotiating with the next organizer, we also need to discuss with the members. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Participants of the membership meeting have the right to know that the date of the meeting is to be changed. They negotiate with the organizing committee. The organizing committee may not adopt the member&#39;s opinions, but there must be such negotiation. There must be a stage for expressing opinions.&quot; During a break in the business meeting, Southern Weekend reporters interviewed Qianxing. He looked a little excited and strode up to the podium. He spoke slowly but forcefully, hoping to add the terms negotiated with members to Kevin&#39;s proposal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After voting, Kevin’s proposal was passed, but Qianxing’s supplementary clause was not passed. However, the entire meeting was recorded on video, and Qianxing&#39;s speeches and opinions have been recorded and become the permanent historical archives of the World Science Fiction Convention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xixia’s proposal also passed the preliminary review. At next year&#39;s World Science Fiction Convention in Glasgow, Kevin and Xixia&#39;s proposal will be reviewed, debated, and voted on by members again. In this way, the &quot;World Science Fiction Association Charter&quot; allows the World Science Fiction Conference to respond to the changes of the times and the demands of fantasy fans. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Setting records and making history&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the evening of October 21, 2023, the 81st Chengdu World Science Fiction Conference awarded this Hugo Award. Prior to this, many faces of color have been added to the nominations for this year&#39;s awards, and the Chinese finalists are eye-catching. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chinese illustrator Zhao Enzhe won the Best Professional Artist Award, &quot;Zero Gravity&quot; edited by Chinese science fiction fans He He and Ling Shizhen won the Best Fan Magazine Award, and science fiction writer Hai Miao&#39;s novel &quot;Time and Space&quot; The Painter&quot; won the &quot;Best Short Novella Award&quot;. According to the tradition of the Hugo Awards, the organizing committee of the conference will disclose the voting details and data after the awards. For example, the data of the 2022 World Science Fiction Convention in Chicago can still be found on the official website. After the conference, the official website of the Hugo Awards wrote: &quot;Currently we do not have the details of this voting data. We will announce the data as soon as we obtain it.&quot; The official Chinese website of the Chengdu World Science Fiction Conference is also temporarily unavailable. this data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dave McCarty, head of the Hugo Award Selection Committee, told reporters after the awards night: &quot;Hai Miao&#39;s &quot;The Painter of Space and Time&quot; does not have an English translation. It has created a complete novel without an English translation. The history of winning awards for Chinese works.&quot; This means that most of the members who voted for &quot;Painter of Time and Space&quot; may be Chinese readers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the second day after the awards, the &quot;Galaxy&#39;s Edge&quot; (mook) which published &quot;The Painter of Space and Time&quot; was sold out in the science fiction museum. Because there were so many people asking, the bookshelf in the science fiction fan area had to wait Put up a &quot;Sold Out&quot; sign. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course Liu Cixin’s works are also selling hotly. Liu Cixin’s autograph session will be held at 2 pm on October 20. Other writers’ autograph sessions are usually only arranged for 20 minutes. The organizer gave Liu Cixin a preview. Three hours were left for signings. Fans packed the signing hall on the third floor early. The queue stretched from the third floor to the first floor, and then snaked half a circle around the venue. Many fans whose legs were sore from standing sat on Liu&#39;s book. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not easy for the publishing organizations participating in the exhibition to sign and sell their books at this venue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xi Xi is an editor of a publishing organization. This time he brought an author&#39;s science fiction novel to Chengdu and organized a salon, hoping that science fiction fans can have a good chat with the author himself. Host a book signing. At first, Xixi reported the entire process to the organizing committee, but a few days before the opening, she received a notice that the salon could not be placed together with the autograph signing. &quot;In normal book fairs, there are book signings after the exchange between authors and readers, but here the two venues must be separated and the time periods must be separated,&quot; Xixi said. This means that readers who are interested in the author have to make two trips to get a signed copy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are various salons, forums, and summits at the World Science Fiction Convention, but in addition to the opening and closing ceremonies and the Hugo Award presentation party, there is also an &quot;Industrial Development Summit&quot; where almost all major guests are invited The summit was attended with a lineup worthy of Hugo Awards night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the first time an industry development-related conference has been held at the World Science Fiction Convention. At the meeting, a number of plans related to the development of the science fiction industry were announced, including the &quot;Chengdu Consensus on the Science Fiction Industry&quot;, the &quot;Tianwen&quot; Plan, the &quot;2023 China Chengdu Science Fiction Industry Report&quot;, etc., and there was even a centralized signing ceremony for science fiction industry projects. According to According to statistics, there are 21 signed projects with a total investment of 8 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this &quot;Industrial Development Summit&quot;, Liu Cixin no longer talked about literature, but talked about industrial development: &quot;Chengdu has long planned the layout of the science fiction industry, related industrial planning and industrial policies , talent policies, etc. have all been implemented.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Science fiction industry chain ecosystem&quot;, &quot;IP creation&quot; and &quot;strengthening the image of a science fiction city&quot;. Faced with these various fresh vocabulary, Canadian science fiction writer Robert Sawyer said, “I am very shocked to see you turning science fiction into an industry.” He said that those who do these things in North America may be publishers, and science fiction is a career that is random, aimless, and without long-term planning. These industry figures were generally not invited to previous World Science Fiction Conventions, and most of those who came were writers and editors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This area where the Chengdu Science Fiction Museum is located will also be built into the science fiction highland of Chengdu. According to a person close to the local government, a reporter from Southern Weekend said that a science fiction industrial park may be built here in the future. “That street is a science fiction themed block, and science fiction companies may move in in the future. This area is said to be A science fiction camping base, there will be training camps for science fiction writers and summer camps for students every year, and the science fiction museum itself is a large-scale consumption + public welfare space. This circle will be built into a science fiction themed tourist destination.&quot; He stood On the high platform, his fingers drew a large arc from one end to the other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The local government has done support work such as venues and transportation, and also mobilized many volunteers,” Chen Shi said. “The core of the appeal is two points. One is to enhance Chengdu’s city brand image, and the other is to support Science fiction industry.&quot; This conference also set a record - it attracted the most sponsors ever. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;What makes Chinese young people like science fiction?&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The fantasy exhibition area in the afternoon was extremely noisy, even though this One day is already the last day of the World Science Fiction Convention. A robot drummer was beating the drums in a loop in the corner. Parents took their children on public transportation for two hours, and now they have just entered the museum. The children were holding notebooks with stamps and clocks in their hands, and they were screaming and shuttling through various booths. between. There is also a science fiction fan who is promoting his own book: &quot;The book I wrote is completely opposite to Liu Cixin&#39;s world view...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this sea of ​​noise, there is a person taking a nap on a chair . He had white hair, a cowboy hat on the table, and his eyes were lowered, as if he had entered another world. His name is James Joseph, from Australia. He is in his seventies and has been a science fiction fan for nearly fifty years. In 1975, the World Science Fiction Convention was held in Oceania for the first time. He was moved by the atmosphere of science fiction and has been to the World Science Fiction Convention 15 times so far. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;James told Southern Weekend reporters that this conference is the most special one he has ever been to. He has never seen so many enthusiastic and young science fiction fans in Europe or the United States before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Youth is a key word of this conference. &quot;I signed more names today than in the past 56 years combined.&quot; Nicholas White seemed a little flattered when he was surrounded by primary school students looking for his signature. The students walked along the booth and checked in one by one, asking for autographs. The organizing committee has reached cooperation with many primary and secondary schools in Chengdu and organized many students to attend various salons and forums. There was almost no silence in the science fiction museum. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alan Brandt, a member of the 2025 Seattle Fantasy Organizing Committee, told Southern Weekend reporters that the scale of the Chengdu World Science Fiction Convention is the largest he has ever seen. The previous record holder was held in London in 2014, with around 10,000 participants. According to figures released by official media, the number of participants in Chengdu exceeded 20,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the West, the golden age of science fiction literature was the decades after World War II. At that time, the United States and the Soviet Union were competing for hegemony, and the Western economy was developing rapidly. Science fiction literature followed the trend and became the spiritual home of many young people at that time. More than half a century has passed, and the science fiction fans of those days are getting older. Old Western science fiction fans like James Joseph, whose silver hair is the highlight of the Chengdu Science Fiction Museum. &quot;For American science fiction works, many readers are gray-haired, that is, only middle-aged and elderly people read science fiction works. But in China, on the contrary, young people prefer science fiction works. This is my confusion, what makes Chinese young people like it? Science fiction?&quot; Robert Sawyer asked this question in Chengdu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every previous conference would set up a memorial area. This is a place for middle-aged and elderly science fiction fans to reminisce and reminisce about the past. In 2017, the British science fiction writer Brian Aldiss passed away. There was a small space at the World Science Fiction Convention that year, which displayed his works and photos during his lifetime, as well as some of his treasures, a simple A black and white TV plays interviews with him during his lifetime. In 2023, Aldis&#39;s daughter Wendy also came to Chengdu. She told Southern Weekend reporters that the Chengdu World Science Fiction Convention was originally going to hold an exhibition for these photos, but it was not possible &quot;because of lack of space.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Feng originally planned to hold a commemorative exhibition at the conference. The person being remembered is Michael Resnick, the former editor-in-chief of the American science fiction magazine &quot;Galaxy&#39;s Edge&quot;. After Resnick&#39;s death in 2020, his collection and books were put up for online auction, and Baguangfen bought a large number of his collections. &quot;Look, this glass showcase is full of his things.&quot; Yang Feng pointed to a glass Cabinet said. At the beginning, the organizer promised an exhibition area of ​​70 square meters. Worried about missing the exhibition, the collection &quot;spent tens of thousands of yuan on freight to be shipped back.&quot; Later, the exhibition area was occupied by many technology companies, and Yang Feng was only given a glass showcase. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Their golden age has indeed passed.&quot; Yan Feng said, &quot;And China&#39;s science fiction craze has many characteristics of the Internet. I see a lot of people chasing stars here and hear a lot of screaming. Especially for people like Liu and Guo Fan. The development of Chinese science fiction has its luck, and the boost from Internet culture is very powerful.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Xi, a local science fiction writer in Chengdu, believes that the current Chinese science fiction Science fiction is in the early stages of its third wave. &quot;The first time was the prosperity of all industries at the beginning of the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China, the second time was the &#39;Spring of Science&#39; in 1979, and now is the third time.&quot; He said. Wang Jinkang, another science fiction writer who has stopped writing, also recalled the low ebb of Chinese science fiction in the 1990s. “At that time, Chinese science fiction was wild and wild and received little attention from society. However, there were also many science fiction fans. When we went to universities to participate in activities, they all I used chalk to write &quot;Welcome Mr. Wang Jinkang&quot; on the blackboard, and started communicating like this. The simplicity back then had its charm, and I still miss it very much. It is indeed different now.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Can you There was a faint sense of a conflict between science fiction cultures in the conference venue,&quot; Zero Gravity News editor Ling Shizhen told a Southern Weekend reporter about his observations, &quot;but I don&#39;t think this conflict is harmful. Or things that are meaningless, this is a necessary process. Since you want to embrace a truly diverse world, this step cannot be escaped.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a university teacher, Yan Feng has not been in the classroom for a long time. He has met so many international friends at domestic academic conferences, which moved him quite a bit. “The divided world is becoming more and more isolated from each other, even confrontational and hostile, but science fiction must transcend national boundaries to think about the human level. Problem, this is also the valuable part of science fiction.&quot; As Liu Cixin has emphasized on different occasions, &quot;In science fiction, human beings appear as a whole.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alan Brandt said Seattle The World Science Fiction Convention has secured the venue, but the local science fiction association is still negotiating with the hotel in order to get a lower price. Nicholas White said that he was a little &quot;jealous&quot; of Chengdu. He estimated that next year&#39;s World Science Fiction Convention in Glasgow would not be able to attract so much sponsorship: &quot;Obviously, the Chengdu World Science Fiction Convention has received huge support from the local government, which is difficult to achieve in Europe. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Xi Xi and Qian Xing are pseudonyms, and Southern Weekend intern Chen Quanxin also contributed to this article)&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[试管婴儿纳入医保：不孕不育是医学问题，也是社会问题丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259718]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A few days ago, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Medical Insurance Bureau and other departments issued the &quot;About the Inclusion of Some Therapeutic Assisted Reproductive Medical Services&quot; &quot;Notice on the Payment Scope of Basic Medical Insurance and Work-related Injury Insurance Funds&quot;, which includes assisted reproductive projects such as egg retrieval, embryo culture, and embryo transplantation into the payment scope of basic medical insurance. The reimbursement ratios of employee medical insurance and resident medical insurance are 70% and 50% respectively. The new regulations will take effect on November 1, 2023. According to Li Rong, director of the Reproductive Medical Center of Nanning Second People&#39;s Hospital, according to the above notice, women with fertility difficulties can be reimbursed for first- or second-generation in vitro fertilization, ranging from more than 4,000 yuan to more than 10,000 yuan, depending on the type of insurance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This move once again aroused attention and discussion. Previously, several provinces have included assisted reproduction projects in basic medical insurance. Since July 1 this year, Beijing has included 16 therapeutic assisted reproductive technology projects, including in vitro fertilization and artificial insemination, into the scope of basic medical insurance reimbursement; Liaoning has also included 18 assisted reproductive technology projects such as embryo culture and embryo transfer this year. Reproductive projects are included in the catalog of maternity insurance. It is conceivable that more provinces will follow suit, and assisted reproductive technology will be included in basic medical insurance or become standard equipment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are mainly two types of families that benefit from this medical insurance policy: one type of family is for elderly mothers who have reproductive needs but have difficulty conceiving naturally, and the other type of family is for infertility (not caused by age factors) , such as congenital factors, reproductive history, lifestyle or environmental factors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xuehong, an expert from the National Human Assisted Reproductive Technology Review Group, said: It is generally believed that the physiologically ideal reproductive age for women is 22-28 years old, or at least no more than 35 years old, because fertility or ovarian function cannot be achieved before the age of 35. It reaches a peak and then declines rapidly, and the risk of over-age childbirth will also increase; and, according to her clinical experience, the average age of patients seeking assisted reproduction has tended to become younger in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The demand for assisted reproduction in the first category of families stems from the fact that as marriage and childbirth continue to be postponed, the number of infertile people due to age is increasing. According to the 2017 Fertility Situation Sample Survey data, from 2006 to 2016, the average age of first childbirth for Chinese women increased from 24.3 years old in 2006 to 26.9 years old in 2016. In big cities, the age of first childbirth and childbearing is even later. For example, in Shanghai in 2022, the average age of first childbirth will be 30.36 years old, and the average age of childbirth will be 31.18 years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the second type of infertile families, in addition to congenital factors, reproductive history is also a major factor that cannot be bypassed. In 2021, Qiao Jie, Dean of Peking University Third Hospital, released the &quot;Lancet Special Invited Major Report on Maternal and Child Health in China&quot;. The report stated that between 2007 and 2020, the incidence of infertility in my country increased from 12% to 18%. In terms of reproductive history, miscarriage, especially repeated miscarriage, may lead to postoperative salpingitis, endometritis, or even fallopian tube adhesions and uterine cavity adhesions, which may lead to infertility. The above-mentioned report shows that from 2005 to 2017, China’s induced abortion rate increased from 20.2‰ to 27.3‰. Among women in China who have experienced at least one miscarriage, the repeat miscarriage rate is 65.2%. The high miscarriage rate and repeated miscarriage rate are highly positively correlated with the infertility rate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Turning to assisted reproductive technology, such as in vitro fertilization, because of a strong desire to have a child is not an easy matter. Basically, it is a matter of luck to succeed once and for all. From eggs to embryo culture and then to embryo transplantation, problems may occur in every step and the success may fail. The pain suffered by the body and the pressure endured by the spirit cannot be explained to outsiders. The cost is not only money, time and energy, but also mental burden and wear and tear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this sense, the inclusion of IVF in basic medical insurance can only partially cover the financial costs borne by these families, but it cannot fundamentally solve the problem of infertility, because infertility is both a medical problem and , is also a social issue. Generally speaking, if a problem is taken seriously before it appears or is in its infancy, the cost is the lowest if it needs to be prevented and solved if it needs to be solved. Waiting until it becomes a large-scale social problem before dealing with it will not only increase the cost exponentially. rise, and the effect is unsatisfactory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Theoretically, the infertility problem that can be solved is: pushing the age of first childbearing forward to fall within the optimal childbearing age range, which requires early marriage and childbirth; reducing the miscarriage rate, especially repeated miscarriage rate, which means reducing or even avoiding unplanned pregnancies. This is better than resorting to assisted reproductive technology in the future. For individuals and families, it is obvious that they can consider and make decisions in this way. However, once a problem becomes a social problem, it is not that simple, because the essence of this social problem is a problem of values. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people attribute the delay in the age of marriage and childbearing, the decline in fertility rate, and the rise of unmarried and childless people to the high cost of childbearing. But when it comes to fertility, the benefit side is obviously more important than the cost side. Nowadays, many young men and women ask &quot;What is the meaning of getting married, forming a family and having children?&quot; This in itself means a sudden change in the fertility instinct and the values ​​of marriage and childbirth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today we live in an era of unprecedented peace and prosperity. Material abundance is unprecedented. This will first lead to the reduction and disappearance of selection pressure. At this time, the population is more inclined to enjoy self-enjoyment rather than sacrificing self-enjoyment. , go through all kinds of hardships to raise offspring; secondly, it will lead to the rise of the concept of non-marriage and childbearing, which in turn will further suppress the desire to marry and have children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the high abortion rate, especially the repeated abortion rate, from a technical perspective, it is nothing more than a question of strengthening contraceptive measures; from a moral perspective, there is also a question of how to strengthen sexual morality.父母应该关心子女的价值观，言传身教子女对性有一个严肃与谨慎的态度：男性当然应该尊重女性的权利与意愿，并负起应有的责任；女性作为自己身心健康的第一责任人，应该保护自己的身体与生殖健康，在中国司法实践上，生育权或生育决定权是女性独有的，这权利的另一面意味着对自己的终极责任。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在无数个写稿无能的深夜，我都想辞职去植物园当一枚园丁。梦想很快得以实现，地点居然还在香格里拉。 2023年9月，我在香格里拉高山植物园当上了实习园丁。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;香格里拉原名中甸，地处云南迪庆藏族自治州。 3260米，这里是全世界海拔最高的植物园，相当于1/5颐和园的土地上保护着约一千种高等植物。这里有多种以中甸命名的地方特有种，如中甸刺玫、中甸山楂等，还有些是国家重点保护野生植物。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;蹊跷的是，这里还繁育着数百种高原植物，它们基本不是奇花异草，甚至“平凡又普通”；大多数植物园属于财政拨款的事业单位，而香格里拉高山植物园却是一个“三无”——“没钱”“没人”“没编制”的民办非企业组织，1999年筹建，2005年开园，靠自己寻找生存之道。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;这一切赋予了香格里拉高山植物园遗世独立又浪漫的色彩。然而，短暂的实习和采访结束后，浪漫于我早已消解。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;我发现这个植物园和之前去过的都不一样，既没有奇形怪状的盆栽，也不会搜罗全球珍品集锦展览。相反，植物园里有很多类似金丝桃的本土植物，开粉花的中甸刺玫、蓝紫色的中甸乌头，结红果的中甸山楂，矗立的云南松和高山松树……它们的名字就带着本土标签，比如“中甸”“云南”“高山”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;方震东是迪庆维西人，当地缺乏生物人才，他的高考志愿从数学系被改成了生物系，云南大学毕业后回到迪庆高原生物研究所工作。后来，他走遍了迪庆的山脉和山谷，编写了《中国云南横断山野生花卉》一书。快35岁时，方震东想在香格里拉建成一座世界级的植物园，这对当时的他而言，也是一件浪漫的事。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;一位叫乔治·弗瑞斯特的苏格兰人被爱丁堡植物园派到中国，从1904年开始，在横断山脉进行了七次植物探险。他在丽江白沙雇了八个纳西人，把高黎贡山的一株直径达一米多的杜鹃花搬出深山，运到大英博物馆展示；用骡子运出了31000件云南植物种子和腊叶标本，引荐给全世界的园林，标本供爱丁堡皇家植物园的分类学家重新命名和发表新种。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;弗瑞斯特从云南带回的杜鹃花和报春至今仍在爱丁堡植物园繁育，标本保存在标本馆里。 1990年代，方震东去了爱丁堡植物园。如今回想起来，他依然很受触动，“我们当地的植物资源被外国人重视，我们自己呢？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;聊到这，方震东突然起身，找出自己那本《中国云南横断山野生花卉》，指着他导师的导师、已故植物学家秦仁昌先生的一段话，一字一字念道：&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;云南植物之富源，所以贡献于欧美文明之进步者，至远且大，惜乎我国科学落后，国人前此不知利用已有天赋宝藏以厚其生，而反见通都大邑，公私庭院所栽培观赏者，几乎全为舶来之品，为欧美庭园数百年来习见之花卉，一入国境，好之者犹趋之若鹜，舍己芸人，良可叹唉。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;这段话写于1930年代，可即使到1990年代，不重视本土物种，甚至受到外来物种威胁的情况依然存在。方震东还记得，当时一种原产于南美的紫茎泽兰从云南南部进入，顺着滇越铁路向迪庆靠近。他担心当地的生态系统受外来物种入侵影响。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;土地利用也在发生变化，天然牧场变为耕地，山坡因挖沙采石而裸露。方震东发现，迪庆原是野生中国兰花资源最丰富的区域，1980年代，他每进一个山沟，兰花不难找到。但1990年代，兰花热兴起，外来的老板一卡车一卡车把兰花买走，此后野生兰花四处难寻。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;所以方震东想建设植物园，“一是保育当地物种；二是开发利用当地的植物资源用于园林建设和栽培”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;1999年，高山植物园在云南省发改委和原环保厅论证后立项，先设立筹建办公室，方震东被任命为主任。 2001年，园区启动建设，在挖沙采石裸露的伤疤上，种上了植物。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;20、22，我坚持不下去了。 10:36，下雨了，大棚漏雨，一个多小时的搬运工作得以停歇，我不知道有多感恩这场雨。站起身来，眼前一黑，光明和对植物园的浪漫想象都在这一瞬消解。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“建植物园，会有浪漫消失的时刻吗？”我问方震东。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“有，找钱的时候。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;1999年，植物园筹建的办公室仅是临时机构，无法为新聘请的员工交五险。 2004年，植物园办公室邀请相关部门开会，研讨管理体制，得出两种方案：一是共建事业单位，中国科学院西双版纳热带植物园和当地政府各出几个编制共同管理，由中央或地方财政拨款经营，这也是国内植物园常见的体制。另一种是民办非企业，自负盈亏，没有财政预算，没有编制。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“我们把第一套共建方案推荐给政府，但是当时政府财政还比较困难，编制可能也紧张，提出来按第二个方案先管着。”方震东说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;这一方案为后来的经营压力埋下伏笔。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;植物园成立民办非企业后，也成立了第一届理事会,方震东成为法定代表人、理事长兼执行园长。压力像山一样涌来，找建设资金、发员工工资，还需要承担当地社区生态补偿。合计下来，每年维护植物园的费用不少于三百万。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;虽处于旅游胜地，这里却难以靠游客收入赚钱。 9月1日17:28，离闭园还有2分钟，全天买票进入植物园的共六位，两位外地游客，四位本地游客，共收费80元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;曾有员工觉得现在游客都爱打卡拍照，建议“要不跟上时代，做一个樱花大道”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;方震东否定得非常直接，“你想看樱花到公园去看嘛，我们又不是公园。”他觉得，更重要的“还是展示被驯化后的当地原生物种，（这才）是我们出发的初衷”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;植物园常常负债。方震东一位好友总是借钱给他，“他是个科学家，不是生意人，只能去写科研报告，接绿化工程，有的（项目）还收不来钱”。一般人的压力最多持续一两个月，而方震东坚持了二十年，靠科研和工程项目支撑，两三年前情况才有所缓解。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;建园24年，植物园在20名员工的努力下，建起了香雪药园、林芝云杉采种园、高山松采种园等多个专类园。经营情况虽有好转，可一些设想还停留在纸面上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;靠近植物园南门的指示牌上写着“干热型”“潮湿型”展览温室，循着方向过去，则是两块裸露着碎石的石灰岩。方震东算了一笔账，温室建设有两部分大头，先是基础设施建设，后是物种搜集和栽培。前期投资估计要一千多万，后期维护更费钱，“保暖、控温、控湿都要考虑”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/29ece74f96.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/29ece74f96.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256376&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;温室目前还停留在路牌和规划中。 &amp;nbsp; 梁静怡/摄&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“累。”植物园现任院长方晔的眼里满是疲倦。三年前，他从父亲方震东手里接手了植物园，想建智慧景区、完善讲解系统，可是都困于没有人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;本地的年轻人更愿意进体制内工作，外地人则嫌偏远，方晔在微博上好不容易招了一个1995年出生的广西大学生，待了4年，“什么都没说”就走了。 4年已算很久了，方晔现在招人都不奢望能待这么长。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;方晔还是希望植物园能并入事业单位，而在并入之前，这家民办非企业组织还要靠自己寻找出路。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;雨停了，我数了数，墙边已经摆上了一百多袋的金丝桃，一位园丁师傅把围裙脱下，我看到他缠绕着一圈又一圈的白色护腰带。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;种子&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;高山植物园苗圃育出金丝桃苗的第一步，自然是先有种子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;园丁师傅带我去看金丝桃的种子。一走进苗圃二楼的种子仓库，松香扑面而来。我第一次见到这么多“干货”：高山松的球果像有弹性的褐色小球，鲁冰花的种子像拇指大小的莲蓬，林芝云杉的果则像晒干的坚硬玫瑰。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;他从一个大麻袋里抓出一小撮说，“这是金丝桃的种子”。我凑近看，它们比沙子轻，比木屑小，风一吹就跑了，随风繁衍，这是自然的生存法则。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;但人类搜集种子就难了。临到11月金丝桃出种季，植物园会请村民去野外搜集金丝桃种子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;可并不是所有种子都能靠村民，植物园的员工也得去野外采种子，同时也考察极小种群、搜集标本。极小种群是指分布地域狭窄，受外界干扰严重，随时濒临灭绝的野生植物。要找到它们，异常艰难。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;2020年8月17日，平凡的一天，世界上有许多大事发生，但暂时与我们无关。我们行走于西藏净地的日喀则地区吉隆县吉隆镇乃夏村的后山，专注于野外调查工作，远离了信息的喧嚣，似乎所有的流言都失去了载体，成了一座座无名的孤岛。处于这样的环境中，我们每天似乎都有很多的话，又似乎每天都在说同样的话。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;“你饿不饿？”……说实话，我也有些饿，但这不算什么……&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;只是身体像海绵吸收了山顶雾水，冲锋衣里都是水，湿漉漉的，脱了又像塞在冰箱里面，从脊椎骨直冒嗖嗖的寒气。然后肺里面塞了火炉，冷气吸进去，肺直疼。脚？我已经对它没多少指望了，只希望回到住所前没罢工就好了……&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;今天走得太久，又走得太远。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;从海拔2800米拉升到海拔4000米，只为寻找胡黄连。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;和普通种子被装在麻袋里不同，那些备受艰辛采回的种子被锁在一个小房间里，尊贵地存储于一个个玻璃罐子或者塑料盒子里，这里是种子库——“高原植物的诺亚方舟”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/ee1e78f938.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/a21754f83b.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1646&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/a21754f83b.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;成功繁育绿绒蒿的例子少之又少。 2022年12月5日，刘琳和同事们种下一批绿绒蒿，一个月后，出苗率不到50%。绿绒蒿“最容易死是长出两瓣叶片的时候，水多它会死，水少也会死，所以很难”。我问她最终有多少苗活下来，她指了指远处的那堆土，“你看这里本来全是，一半已经死了”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;工作十几年，对刘琳而言，接受植物的死亡早已习惯。身经百战，关关难过，出苗之后还有炼苗——采取放风、降温、适当控水等措施锻炼幼苗。她还记得第一次种的尼泊尔黄花木，在苗圃温室里养了半年移出去炼苗，一个冬天全死了，两万棵只剩下两三棵。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;只能一切重来。他们估摸着，也许是太冻了，移栽的季节不对。所以趁尼泊尔黄花木苗还在温室时，偶尔摆出来在太阳下炼一会儿，结实一点再移栽。这些高原本土植物的繁育，没有前人的经验，“只能试着做”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;像我今天搬运的金丝桃，出苗很容易，但不知道为何，小苗移栽时候容易死。所以他们摸索出了新方案：把袋子灌满土，种子点在土里，等苗长大了，直接把袋子撕开种进地里即可。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;我能看到的每棵纤纤金丝桃都是奇迹，历经生死。然而金丝桃并不属于珍稀物种，也没有进保护名录，刘琳、园丁师傅们费尽心力繁育的本土植物，最终要去哪呢？ &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;修复&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023年8月30日，我跟着绿色和平团队在离香格里拉不远的一条公路看到，一些为修路炸开的山，裸露的地块上种了整整齐齐的杉树，可叶子发蔫发黄，在高寒的山里耷拉着。绿色和平的研究员不无惋惜地说，“这些树估计都是活不成的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;刘琳说，很多生态修复都是买外来树种，价格便宜，容易扦插，但很难适应当地环境，后期的维护管理也比较难，严重影响成活率。方晔解释，很多人觉得生态修复，就是一两年内检查验收时绿起来就够了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;香格里拉在1980、1990年代遭遇过大规模商业采伐，2010年后，大家意识到了生态修复的重要性。但是方震东感觉，最初的生态修复“根本没有好的理念和思路，绿化公司按现成方案找现成树种，也不管植物能不能适应（环境）”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;8月28日，我在香格里拉参加了一场关于生态修复的研讨会，来自云南大学、中国林业科学研究院的专家们也认为真正的生态修复不是单纯种树和绿化：在黄土高原不顾一切地种树，不让间伐，森林过密会给水源少的地方雪上加霜； 火未必是“万恶之源”，对于有的森林，火只是把表层烧焦，种子在火烧后给予时间，则会焕发生机。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;研讨会后，方震东带我们去看大果青杄——松科云杉属乔木，国家二级保护植物。他说，政策规定谁砍伐谁恢复，大果青杄被大量用来造林。建植物园时，有课题组也申请退化林地的植被恢复课题，在植物园种了300亩的大果青杄。刚种上时生长很慢，到一米后快速生长，果实红而光滑，观赏性很好。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;方震东忽然停下讲解，寻找记者，提醒我记下来。他接着说，香格里拉一处景点有一片大果青杄林地，相继出现病害、虫害。有一种云杉鳃扁叶蜂会把这个树的针叶全部啃光。另外有一种真菌病害，树叶莫名其妙开始黄，紧接着整个树干就干枯，树成片死亡。香格里拉高山植物园也发生过虫害，但后来没有了，也许被其他的生物控制住了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;但在很多地方，整片云杉被病害侵蚀，传入当地的落叶松。然而，本地云杉不会长这种病害。 “我们跟林业部门建议，今后造林了不要用这个（大果青杄）种，要用我们本地的云杉。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/073c891244.jpg&quot;

text-align: center;&quot;>;植物园里的大果青扦梁静怡/摄&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2006年，方震东领会到生态修复演替理论：植物群落是动态变化的，随着时间的推移，一个植物群落被另一个植物群落代替。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;从裸露地表开始，草种飞进来演变成草本植被；鸟兽把灌木和乔木种子通过粪便排在这里，演变成灌丛；乔木十几年后长成优势植被，变成森林；不同种类的乔木经过幼龄、中龄慢慢成熟，上百年后成为顶级植被。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;采伐开矿则是重新将顶级植被打回原始的裸露地表，如果没有人为干预，自然依然会重来一轮演替。而方震东团队尝试把上百年的演替时间缩短，比如依靠风鸟兽传播种子要数十年，人工播种插苗则只需几天。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;演替的过程中，有的植物被称为“先锋植物”，它们很快萌芽，覆盖住地表。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“比如我搬运的金丝桃？”我问方震东。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“对，它算是一种先锋植物，在2000-3300米的海拔范围，在火烧地上能自然生长起来。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;香格里拉植物园里的本土植物适应了高寒、恶劣的环境，在生态修复中，后续维护费低，也不容易受到病虫害影响。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;近年来，生态修复失败的项目纷纷到植物园请教经验。困于经营的植物园也找到生存之道，不再负债。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/4462cf67f4.jpg&quot;

I&#39;m talking about Andie MacDowell, the heroine of Four Weddings and A Funeral. The poet Zhu Zhu once uniquely compared Juliette Binoche to &quot;the first bite of ice cream in spring.&quot; Yes, everyone has their own bite of ice cream. The difference is that his ice cream is French, while mine is from the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is said that &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; is the representative of British comedy movies, but the overwhelming joy of it has been almost forgotten. What can&#39;t be washed away is Andy&#39;s eyes, which look tenderly and lovingly at Hugh Grant, who always looks hasty and clumsy, and at me, who is also hasty and clumsy. She is the kind of person who is very tolerant and restrained, allowing you to make mistakes and holding you lightly in her arms. During the time when I was in my twenties, Andy had been quietly watching my sadness, unobtrusively and undazzlingly, like the simple and strange flower in my youthful dreams. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, she was forgotten. Time flies by, the soul is lost, the youthful mood gradually fades, and there are no more dreams at night. As a result, Andy became a coordinate of his youth, precipitated in the light and shadow of time, eroded and lost day by day. When the world of mortals rises, what is left in our hearts? I once read some beautiful short poems and was filled with emotion, so I wrote a quatrain: &quot;After eating, my heart is drowning in the Zen of my pen, and I am disappointed with the dripping of powder and kneading cakes. I was also very fond of it back then, and once wrote about the spring breeze.&quot; When spring ice cream Melting little by little, the strange flowers in the dream withered little by little, Andy, none of us can resist the wand of time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Since ancient times, beauties are like famous generals, and they are not allowed to grow old in the world.&quot; In the blink of an eye, Andy is in his sixties, right? It is no longer easy to find negative photos of her youth online. Audrey Hepburn, Catherine Zeta Jones, Sophie Marceau, Maggie Cheung, Rosamund Kwan, Christy Chung, Zhu Yin... How should they think lovingly of their radiant beauty when they look in the mirror at midnight? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Seventy Years Back in Time&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/vpztrExXnh6Tp89qxkOGuwoYdapFWWvdWJCAtFYr. jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/vpztrExXnh6Tp89qxkOGuwoYdapFWWvdWJCAtFYr.jpg&quot; data-key= &quot;256018&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Somewhere in Time &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>; &quot;The flowers bloom in spring, the wind in autumn and the setting sun in winter, I once ignorantly thought so in my melancholy youth.&quot; On the university campus in the 1980s and 1990s, there was no other music than Luo Dayou&#39;s This song touches our heartstrings even more. I am a person who is quite sensitive to time. When I was a teenager, I would be immersed in her magic and couldn&#39;t extricate myself. Later, after seeing the dead end, the legend, the ups and downs, and life and death, I finally understood time. If you can heal everything and carve everything, you are already heading towards the vicissitudes of middle age. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So I have been fanatical about Time Movie for a long time. Because movies are one of the ways to understand time. It has infinite capabilities of hypothesis and expression, and it brings me endless emotion and sadness. A movie that also belongs to youth: &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; (Somewhere in Time). At the end, when the male protagonist sees today&#39;s sun and moon inlaid on the coin, the beauty from seventy years ago instantly moves to that end of time. Falling, how melancholy it is forever and ever, and how terrifying it is! Time-themed movies usually have amazing visual effects, like &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, like &quot;Black Hole Frequency&quot;, like &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, but this one does not. It relies on time itself to create the effect, like a cup of pure Kuding. Tea, without any added flavour. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/kcje4CxpjUT7PJW6oRdUxKTdl0CK4IBNe9MBXEOL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;453&quot; height=&quot;664&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/kcje4CxpjUT7PJW6oRdUxKTdl0CK4IBNe9MBXEOL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256019 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The Shawshank Redeption&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what is the taste of time? To me, at least, those black and white video tapes with blurry, pulsing images are one of a kind. After I fell in love with movies, those black and white lights and shadows accompanied me for a long time, day and night, morning and night, like dreams that I couldn&#39;t see clearly or remember. &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot;, &quot;Last Year at Marienba&quot;, &quot;Fang Fang&quot;, &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Underground&quot;, and yes, there is also the one that can never be skipped &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; (The Shawshank Redemption). After watching it dozens of times, I still can&#39;t quite explain its charm. Or, any elaboration and explanation are unnecessary. As the Buddhists say, will it become a &quot;textual barrier&quot;? However, there are some sentences that I can still retrieve from the warehouse of my memory at will (thanks to the subtitles of the video version, their Chinese version is no less than Stephen King): &quot;We can&#39;t understand what is being sung in it, but it seems to be an angel The sound made the thick stone wall disappear without a trace. At this moment, the prisoners in Shark Castle regained their freedom.&quot; &quot;Busy, busy living, or busy dying.&quot; &quot;Some birds cannot be shut down because of their wings. It’s so glorious.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Birds with brilliant wings lingered in my once bleak world. Without their chirping, we would always be prisoners of despair.

Nong Jian Illustration&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The entire network of self-media will implement a real-name system at the front desk.&quot; In mid-October 2023, &quot;Hong Rong&quot;, a financial blogger with more than 3.5 million fans, posted this news on Weibo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Almost at the same time, Weibo CEO Wang Gaofei began to display his real name in the personal information column of his Weibo account &quot;Come and Go&quot;, marking &quot;self-media front desk real name&quot;, and communicated with Weibo netizens many times Leave messages and interact on related topics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of October 31, Weibo issued an announcement stating that it will soon guide self-media accounts with more than 1 million fans in social current affairs, military, finance, medical, legal and other professional fields to fill in real-name information, and will expand in the future. to more than 500,000 fans. Bilibili, WeChat, Douyin, Kuaishou and other platforms also issued similar news, implementing a front-end real-name system for &quot;head self-media&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past ten years or so, the online real-name system has experienced a development process from scratch, from partial to comprehensive. In 2011, local documents required Weibo users to &quot;real-name in the background and voluntarily in the front-end.&quot; In 2017, Weibo fully implemented this requirement. Now, now, the real-name system has gradually moved from behind the scenes to the front. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This quickly triggered heated social debate. In the past, almost every time a request for a real-name system came out, there would be similar debates. Supporters believe that the online real-name system can enhance the standardization and responsibility awareness of online activities, help eliminate rumors and obscene information, reduce online violence or illegal crimes using false information, and improve the sense of security in netizens&#39; lives. Opponents believe that, The real-name system not only affects information security and the sense of relaxation in public expression, but also endangers the security of personal information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The real-name system at the front desk has changed personal information from centralized collection by a small number of platforms to being exposed to a wide range of public views. Its impact is more complex and diverse. Some scholars have publicly suggested: &quot;This is a big matter and it is not appropriate to do so.&quot; Launched hastily.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Weibo is not alone&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend observed that as of the evening of October 31, many Weibo influencers with more than 1 million fans were still &quot;anonymous&quot; in the front office. On Bilibili, Douyin and other platforms, most leading self-media in related fields do not see real-name information displayed on their personal homepages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Weibo announcement, the platform will guide users to fill in the information that needs to be displayed at the front desk. According to Wang Gaofei&#39;s internal beta information on his personal page, the personal information that may be displayed in the future includes real name, gender, zodiac sign, occupation, IP location, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Private messages sent to big V from Weibo previously obtained by Southern Weekend show that the first batch of front-end self-media accounts need to be real-named before the end of October, and accounts with 500,000-1 million fans need to be real-named by the end of December. completed before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the aforementioned private message mentioned that the real-name system requires all platforms on the entire network to implement it uniformly. &quot;As for the front-end real-name system, Weibo, Douyin, Tencent and other platforms have communicated and fought for it many times. If it causes trouble, , you can feedback your opinions and suggestions through your own channels, or you can submit them to us for forwarding.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to find from the announcements released by major platforms that the real-name system for top self-media front desks has become inevitable. The main difference between platforms lies in the number of fans of the first batch of real-name self-media accounts. Except for Douyin, which started with accounts with more than 500,000 fans, the others all started with accounts with more than 1 million fans, and then gradually expanded to more than 500,000 fans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There is no standard and clear implementation document this time. Each platform can only explore and implement it based on its own platform attributes and past review priorities.” A platform insider revealed. According to him, front-end real-name verification is slightly different from content review. The latter has a certain amount of &quot;discretionary space&quot;, while the former must be implemented when it reaches a certain level. The platform it is on will have a larger number of fans and greater influence in a certain field. The account priority requires the front desk to real-name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the background of this incident, the aforementioned private message stated that it was to further implement the &quot;13 Self-Media Management Regulations&quot; of the Cyberspace Administration of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2023, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued a notice, in order to strengthen the management of &quot;self-media&quot;, consolidate the main responsibilities of website platform information content management, and improve the normalized management system and mechanism, requiring website platforms to &quot; &#39;We-media&#39; engaged in the production of information content in the fields of finance, education, medical and health, justice and other fields shall undergo strict verification and display the names of their service qualifications, professional qualifications, professional background and other certification materials on the account homepage, and add the label of their field.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Affected by multiple factors, I feel that responding to the increasingly serious problem of cyber violence and building a better online content ecosystem are top priorities.” Wang Sixin, a professor at Communication University of China, said that in recent years, cyber violence has Problems occur frequently. Starting in 2022, relevant departments have intensively introduced a number of targeted measures, and platform parties have further implemented their respective responsibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Sixin is a consulting expert of the Cyberspace Administration of China and has participated in legislative work including the Cybersecurity Law and the &quot;Regulations on the Ecological Governance of Network Information Content&quot;. He explained that because big Vs often have wider social influence, and some have complex backgrounds and diverse purposes, some big Vs have their own teams behind them, and their online activities, including speeches, endorsements, etc., all have commercial interests. In practice, It is difficult to rule out the possibility of misleading the public for economic interests, which will have many negative impacts on the healthy development of the information ecology. &quot;The front-end real-name system will help these big Vs enhance their sense of social responsibility and risk awareness, and standardize their behavior in cyberspace.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Gaofei responded on Weibo to the issue raised by some Weibo users who were unwilling to use their real names. You can clear your followers to delete them below 1 million, or change your posts to other fields. The aforementioned private message also mentioned that it can help users &quot;detect spam fans and help clean them up.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the Weibo announcement also stated that for users who should be real-name but do not want to be real-name, the traffic and income of the account will be partially restricted, including restrictions on recommendation stream display, hot search display restrictions, advertising sharing restrictions, Tip income limits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The relevant details are still unclear at the moment. The platform should balance the real-name and personal information security issues at the front desk, such as the obligation to inform in advance and whether it is necessary to display the work unit and position information of the big V at the front desk. , whether the employer can refuse, and whether there is an exit mechanism if the individual is unwilling, and procedures need to be set up.&quot; said Zhu Wei, deputy director of the Communication Law Research Center of China University of Political Science and Law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There is still a big difference in what kind of personal information is displayed at the front desk.” Zhu Wei gave an example. For example, if a doctor influencer discloses that his occupation type is a doctor, it may be more important than disclosing his employer and company. Job information can further reduce the occurrence of cyber violence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the aforementioned announcement on Weibo, the content related to the protection of front-end information is: users who are not logged in, have not passed the verification of real identity information, have abnormal behavior, and have been dealt with recently are prohibited from viewing the real-name information of other users&#39; front-end information. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;More than twenty years of evolution and changes&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As early as 2002, Li Xiguang, a professor at the School of Journalism at Tsinghua University (now the School of Journalism and Communication) mentioned in an interview with a TV station that he suggested that the National People’s Congress Anyone should be prohibited from being anonymous online, sparking heated public discussion. This is considered by the media to be the first time that the online real-name system has entered the public eye in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the following ten years, the online real-name system began to be partially tested. In 2004, the Ministry of Education issued the &quot;Opinions on Further Strengthening Campus Network Management in Colleges and Universities&quot;, and the &quot;Internet Real-Name System&quot; was officially written into official documents, and college online forums began to implement user real-name registration; in 2005, Tencent, according to the Shenzhen Public Security Bureau&#39;s &quot;About &quot;Notice on Carrying out the Clean-up and Rectification of Online Public Information Service Sites&quot;, which requires real-name registration of the founders and administrators of QQ groups; in 2006, the State Administration of Press and Publication proposed the &quot;Real-name System Plan for Online Games&quot;, requiring online game players to register with their real names in order to Distinguish between adults and minors...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Until 2011, the real-name requirement once again aroused great concern. That year, Beijing promulgated the &quot;Several Regulations on the Development and Management of Microblogs in Beijing&quot;, proposing that Weibo users must use their true identity information when registering, and implement &quot;real names on the backend and voluntary on the frontend.&quot; Subsequently, Weibo publicly stated that it would implement real-name registration for new users and gradually improve the real-name review of old users. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for why Weibo users are required to have their real names, in 2012, Wang Chen, then director of the Cyberspace Administration of China, responded publicly, saying that Weibo has the characteristics of fast dissemination, great influence, and wide coverage, and has a strong social influence. Mobilizing power. Weibo has changed the previous public opinion communication pattern. While reflecting social conditions and public opinion, enriching information services, and conducting public opinion supervision, it has also enabled the rapid spread of harmful information such as negative public opinion, obscenity, and fabricated lies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Since 2009, Weibo has used its influence on the platform to have a huge impact on the formation and direction of public opinion on many issues involving public interests. What happened in China around 2011 Many public events have become hot fodder on the Internet.&quot; Wang Sixin further explained that among the series of management measures that were subsequently formed, many requirements were formed based on learning these lessons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Sixin gave an example. When the Wenzhou high-speed train accident occurred in July 2011, “the Internet was filled with various rumors about the accident, which gradually became outrageous and evolved into attacks on China’s high-speed rail and national economic development model. &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The existing management is very unsuitable and poses new challenges to network information security and social harmony and stability.&quot; Wang Chen mentioned in the above speech. &quot;The regulatory requirements for online real names were also proposed and gradually implemented under this background.&quot; Wang Sixin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2012, the &quot;Decision of the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress on Strengthening Network Information Protection&quot; was promulgated and implemented. In the form of a legal document, it is clearly required that online service platforms need to register users with real names. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next peak of attention regarding the online real-name system occurred around 2016. The Cybersecurity Law was promulgated in 2016 and came into effect in 2017. Article 24 of the Law stipulates: When signing an agreement with a user or confirming the provision of services, network operators shall require users to provide their true identity information. If they do not provide their true identity information, they shall not provide services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2017, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued the &quot;Internet Comment Service Management Regulations&quot;, requiring all online platforms to authenticate the real identity information of registered users in accordance with the principle of &quot;real-name backend and voluntary front-end&quot;. Otherwise, no comment service will be provided to them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the same year, Weibo issued the &quot;Announcement on Weibo&#39;s Promotion of Completing the Real-Name System for Accounts&quot;, requiring all users to complete real-name verification before September 15, 2017, otherwise they will no longer be able to send comments and new posts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The promulgation of legislation and related normative requirements was also prompted by some events. Wang Sixin introduced that the Snowden &quot;Prism&quot; incident in 2013 (the electronic surveillance program implemented by the United States) aroused high-level attention to national network information security, and related work such as legislation on network security has also been accelerated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the telephone real-name system also provides convenience for online registration. In 2013, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology required users to provide their true identity information when handling landline, mobile phone, broadband and other Internet transfer services. And in late 2015, the operator stopped serving non-real-name numbers. As for online service platforms, most of them use mobile phone number verification to complete the registration review. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The pros and cons of foreign real-name systems&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At present, supervision of the Internet environment is relatively common internationally. For example, the United Kingdom has introduced a Communications Data Act, which stipulates that network users need to register personal information such as names and addresses; mobile online communication services in the United States need to be bound to social security numbers that can identify personal information; Germany has also introduced laws to supervise the Internet, providing Merchants operating online, Internet mail, telephone and mobile phone users shall implement real-name registration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also places that require the public to provide personally identifiable information to market-based service platforms. Southern Weekend learned from netizens in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia and other countries, as well as several Chinese people who have lived in many countries, that currently enterprise service platforms in many countries do not require direct real-name registration, but some countries require binding The email address or mobile phone number associated with the personal information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not many people ask for real names at the front desk. In Wang Sixin&#39;s view, the front-end real-name system requirements for network service platforms this time are &quot;essentially detailed specifications for the management of front-end network real-name systems. Many tasks are not carried out in one step and need to be carried out step by step.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, in the past process of China&#39;s online real-name system, almost every step has attracted great attention, especially the real-name system on market-oriented platforms such as social platforms and information services, which often triggers heated debates among all parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend searched past literature and reports and found that supporters of the real-name system generally believe that the anonymity of the Internet has given rise to a series of problems such as online language violence, rumors and defamation, Internet fraud and even illegal crimes. In recent years, frequent incidents Internet violence incidents have also caused serious physical and mental harm to the parties involved in some social incidents, and the real-name system is a good solution to the above problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Nowadays, many self-media accounts are operated by a team, often with some commercial demands. We-media accounts with a large number of fans must disclose their true identities and be responsible for their online speeches.&quot; Zhu Wei said. He added that in lawsuits related to cyber violence cases, the burden of proof lies with the plaintiff, but the personal information of the alleged infringing subject needs to be obtained from the platform through the court, and the front-end real-name system can also simplify this process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most opponents believe that the real-name system inhibits the enthusiasm for public discussions, expressing true thoughts, and putting forward valuable opinions, and is not conducive to venting emotions and easing conflicts. In recent years, many corruption cases have been detected through anonymous reporting online, and the real-name system will put pressure on the reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Both social psychology and communication science have confirmed that in an environment where personal information tends to be transparent, people’s words and deeds also tend to follow the herd, and people who follow the herd rarely have a sense of innovation. From From the perspective of social development, real-name identification at the front desk is not conducive to encouraging people to think actively and be brave in innovation.&quot; said Lao Dongyan, a professor at Tsinghua University Law School. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lao Dongyan also believes that the real-name system at the front desk may not solve the problem of cyber violence, but may instead give rise to some kind of &quot;precision cyber violence.&quot; &quot;I started using Weibo in 2022, and I have always used my real name. I have been verbally abused and insulted many times because of my participation in public discussions. Some people not only reported me online @my unit, but even reported it offline. The real-name system at the front desk is for these People provide convenience.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the concerns about the real-name system, one issue runs throughout: the online real-name system will affect the security of personal information. This worry is not groundless. In 2017, experts from the Ministry of Public Security told the media that the generalization of the online real-name system has indeed affected personal information security. The more information collected such as personal ID numbers and facial recognition, the more information will be leaked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There have been related incidents in China. In 2016, Xu Yuyu, a student from Shandong Province, was defrauded by a fraudulent phone call to pay for college. She was depressed and eventually died of cardiac arrest. According to media reports, the student information leaked in this case was caused by criminals attacking the candidate information system of the local education bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also international precedents. In 2005, a girl in South Korea encountered online violence because she refused to clean up pet feces. As a result, the girl was forced to drop out of school and became mentally ill. In order to control cyber violence, starting from that year, the South Korean government began to gradually require the public to implement real names on the Internet. It was gradually promoted in gradients and fields, supplemented by measures such as improving legislation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By 2010, a total of 167 Korean websites implemented the online real-name system, mainly large portals, news websites and shopping platforms. However, between 2010 and 2012, large-scale user information leaks occurred on multiple platforms, the largest of which affected 35 million people, while South Korea&#39;s total population in 2010 was only over 48 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2012, South Korea’s online real-name system was suspended. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Telecom fraudsters are very rampant now. It can no longer be solved by blocking individual mobile phone numbers, because the other party often uses a virtual number and may receive fraudulent calls anytime and anywhere.&quot; Lao Dongyan said , she herself has been woken up by fraudulent phone calls in the middle of the night many times, and she can no longer bear the disturbance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relevant departments are also strengthening the protection of personal information security. The National People&#39;s Congress&#39;s decision on network information security in 2012 and the Cybersecurity Law introduced in 2016 both set forth prohibitive regulations on the collection, use, and protection of citizens&#39; personal information by platforms. In 2021, the Personal Information Protection Law will also be officially implemented, making all-round normative requirements for personal information protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, the public security department has also continuously strengthened its efforts to combat domestic and cross-border telecom fraud. In addition to conventional detection of related cases, it has also launched multiple special operations to focus on combating telecom fraud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Sixin said that in the future, the supervision of Internet information dissemination will be more standardized. &quot;Managing the Internet in accordance with the law, using the Internet in accordance with the law, and providing services in accordance with the law will become the norm in the process of building an Internet civilization.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 11:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[广州地铁要求乘客卸妆惊悚形象？南周记者实地探了探究竟]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259708]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[除了上厕所不能随意活动？部分中小学生课间10分钟被约束现象调查]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259681]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The 10 minutes between classes are very valuable for students. The figures running freely and the laughter from time to time are the vibrant scenery of the campus. However, &quot;Xinhua Viewpoint&quot; reporters recently investigated in some places and found that some primary and secondary school students were restrained for 10 minutes between classes. Except for drinking water and going to the toilet, they were not allowed to leave the classroom or even leave their seats at will. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;School Protection Regulations for Minors&quot; formulated by the Ministry of Education clearly requires that no unnecessary restrictions shall be placed on students&#39; freedom of speech and behavior such as legitimate communication, games, and activities outside the classroom during recess and other non-teaching time. . So, why do some schools strictly control students’ 10-minute recess activities? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;The campus becomes quiet during the break&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The 10-minute break between classes is commonly known as the break. It is an important time for primary school students to adjust their learning status, relieve fatigue and communicate with each other. The reporter recently visited many primary and secondary schools and saw that the campus became quiet because students were required not to leave the classroom at will during elementary classes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It is understood that this phenomenon has been around for a long time. A 2019 survey of more than 1,900 parents showed that 75.2% of parents believed that the phenomenon of &quot;quiet recess&quot; is common in primary and secondary schools around them, and is most prominent in primary schools. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Parents of students from many primary schools in Changchun City reported that the school requires their children not to play on the playground during recess and can only go to the toilet or move quietly in the corridor. One parent said that the child&#39;s class teacher stipulated that the child should stay in his seat except when going to the toilet during class breaks. &quot;Some students were punished for fighting in the classroom during recess. Since then, they no longer dare to run around after class.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many schools in Haikou City The primary school arranges for teachers on duty to patrol each floor and strictly prohibits students from chasing and playing in the corridors. Some schools also select young pioneers to form a duty team, which scores and assesses the behavior of students in each class during class. Once chasing and fighting are found, points will be deducted from the class. The assessment is directly linked to the selection of civilized classes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Similar phenomena also exist in some primary and secondary schools in Hebei, Guizhou and other places. The reporter saw in a primary school in Langfang City, Hebei Province, that except for some students going to the toilet, most of the children were sitting in the classroom chatting after class. Zhang Xu (pseudonym), a primary school teacher in Zunyi, Guizhou, said that some class teachers do not allow students to play on the playground during recess. &quot;This is too depressing for children&#39;s nature.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many parents of primary school students in Haikou City said that only a few teachers attach importance to students’ physical exercise between classes, and most teachers will try their best to make active primary school students more active in the name of emphasizing discipline. Be quiet, euphemistically called &quot;civilized rest.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Over-restraint&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;is not good for&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;children Healthy Growth&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Why are students frequently over-restrained during primary school breaks? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Some teachers interviewed said that mainly because of the limited space and dense crowds, accidents such as collisions often occur when students play on the playground. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;A teacher from a primary school in a county in Hebei Province said that once a student encounters an accident such as a collision during recess activities, the school not only needs to apologize to the parents, but may also involve financial compensation. For this reason, the school simply emphasizes discipline between classes and reduces children&#39;s outing activities. &quot;It is better to do less than to do more.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In addition, the objective conditions of the site are also an important reason. Many teachers interviewed reported that many urban school teaching buildings are built relatively high, with only 10-minute breaks between classes. The elevators are not enough for students to run up and down, and the narrow corridors easily create the risk of crowding and stampedes. Moreover, the playgrounds of urban schools are small and often have too many children to move around. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many parents believe that restricting children’s recess activities is mainly for schools and teachers to facilitate management and reduce trouble. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Some grassroots educators interviewed also believe that excessive restrictions during small classes violate the regulations of the Ministry of Education and are also a manifestation of extensive and lazy school management. Strictly limiting the scope and intensity of activities for primary and secondary school students during recess can reduce the chance of accidents, but it is not conducive to the healthy growth of children. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This approach will suppress the child&#39;s nature and is not conducive to physical development. Psychologists believe that walking out of the classroom and exercising properly during recess can relieve study pressure and promote interpersonal communication. Yin Ruofeng, deputy chief physician of the Spine Surgery Department of the Third Hospital of Jilin University, said that heavy academic load and decreasing physical activities are important factors affecting the body posture and spinal health of primary and secondary school students. Going out of the classroom to move your limbs during small classes is beneficial to students&#39; health. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Data from the National Health Commission show that the overall myopia rate among children and adolescents in my country in 2022 is 53.6%. According to the interviewed ophthalmology experts, participating in outdoor sports is an important means to prevent and control myopia. Being &quot;crowded&quot; during primary school hours will lead to a reduction in the time for outdoor sports among primary and middle school students and an increase in the probability of myopia. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In addition, this approach can easily make students feel tired of studying. Shen Wei, vice principal of the primary school of Changchun Foreign Languages ​​Experimental School, pointed out that staying in the classroom for a long time may cause students to be mentally burned out; students use recess to adjust and relax their bodies and minds, which can help them concentrate on the next class. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Resolutely implement national protection regulations&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Relevant regulations for minors&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/ h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The &quot;Regulations on the Protection of Minors in Schools&quot; officially implemented on September 1, 2021 requires that schools shall not set up management measures that infringe on students&#39; personal freedom, and shall not punish students during breaks and other non-teaching time There are unnecessary restrictions on the freedom of speech and behavior such as legitimate communication, games, and activities outside the classroom; schools should improve the management system to ensure that students can use the school&#39;s sports venues and facilities for physical exercise during and after class. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/be1e0af9353df253306c927ce8cf3a43.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/be1e0af9353df253306c927ce8cf3a43.png&quot; data-key=&quot;256262 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Primary school students of Changchun Foreign Languages ​​Experimental School skip rope on the playground during recess&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The reporter learned from the interview that some schools use small classes to carry out a variety of outdoor activities. For example, the elementary school of Changchun Foreign Language Experimental School has opened basketball, volleyball and other activity areas, and students can choose according to their personal interests. At the same time, with the support of the school, the head teacher also encourages students to go out and do activities as much as possible. Liancheng Primary School in Congtai District, Handan City, Hebei Province is not only equipped with sports equipment such as basketball, football and badminton, but also equipped with books, chess, backgammon and other items in the classroom for students to use during class. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The teachers and parents interviewed believe that returning small classes to children requires comprehensive measures. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As an important part of campus safety management, schools must carry out campus safety hazard inspections on a regular basis and make campus safety work detailed and solid. Shen Wei introduced that there are 1,980 students in the primary school of Changchun Foreign Languages ​​Experimental School in grades one to six. In order to ensure the safety and order of students’ recess activities, the school dispatched 6 physical education teachers, 6 teachers of all grades and student cadres to monitor the corridors, stairs, The playground is inspected and on duty, and most students can go up and down the stairs in an orderly manner. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Experts suggest that the education authorities should issue guidance, strengthen the supervision and management of schools through supervision, and return recess time to students as much as possible. Schools should also strengthen skills guidance and safety education for students in sports and games to reduce the probability of accidents. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Interviewees believe that when campus management is standardized and school facilities are safe, society and parents cannot simply pass the responsibility to schools and teachers when campus safety problems arise. . A working mechanism for government departments or third-party agencies to standardize the handling of campus safety incidents can be established to reduce the probability of direct conflicts between schools and parents. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“年纪大了，玩芭比有点幼稚”：棉花娃娃寄托的情感生意]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259679]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On April 30, 2023, Kunming, citizens brought cotton dolls to the Jacaranda Taking photos on the avenue.

It was a commemorative photo she took of her cotton doll &quot;Luffy&quot; on her birthday a few months ago - slightly different from ordinary dolls, this character from the anime &quot;One Piece&quot; has a disproportionately large head. Her eyes were bright and she had a silly grin, completely covered by her iconic crescent moon bangs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I saw Luffy sitting upright, with a row of small cakes in front of him. Under the photo, Zhi Tao typed out a line of words sincerely: He is one year older. Happy birthday! &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Because of the incident (Haidilao), I was afraid of being criticized by others.&quot; Zhi Tao is a cotton doll lover. According to the popular gameplay in this circle, Players are like raising children, buying clothes and accessories for their dolls, and taking them on trips, parties, and even birthdays. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, because the outside world does not understand these behaviors, the players who call each other &quot;baby friends&quot; have been criticized a lot. &quot;Netizens said it was a mental illness, and the words were unpleasant.&quot; Zhitao has just entered her junior year. Like many children, she is introverted and sensitive, and is troubled by poor interpersonal communication. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Cotton doll is a trendy doll that has quietly become popular among young people recently. On October 16, 2023, when a consumer brought his cotton doll to Haidilao for dinner, the waiter refused to serve the doll for his birthday. This matter became a hot topic on social platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What kind of charm does cotton doll have that can make young consumers generous? Why do people born in the 1990s and 2000s place their emotional needs on a stuffed toy? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Kid friend: &quot;I have never seen such a nice boy in real life&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Celebrating Luffy’s birthday, it was Shitao who suddenly appeared come up with ideas. That day was the end of the May Day holiday, and my roommate had not returned to school yet. During the day, she had a quarrel with her mother, and was asked repeatedly on the phone why she didn&#39;t go home during the holidays. &lt;p>; &quot;Get up and go to the store to buy a few cakes to celebrate the birthday of this &quot;little friend&quot; who has grown up with you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Usually, comic book authors announce character birthdays on the company website. Luffy is the protagonist of the popular Japanese anime &quot;One Piece&quot;. His brave, fearless, persistent and optimistic character, as well as his pure, kind, affectionate and righteousness towards his friends, made Shitao fall in love with him. &quot;Maybe, I have also wished that I was such a person, or that I had such friends.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;She is the only one in the dormitory, and she has been used to it since she was a child. Zhi Tao, who lives alone, puts the cotton doll Luffy on the bedside on the table, and then puts a small cake on it, and instantly seems to have an emotional connection with this little friend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhitao explained that when it comes to cotton dolls, she actually belongs to a typical &quot;poor family&quot; model. Even so, she can&#39;t help but see beautiful accessories occasionally. Bought to match Luffy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;I am considered a wealthy child.&quot; 19-year-old Zhou Zhou is also a child lover. She raises a cotton doll named Wanzi. When I first got it, Wanzi was just a &quot;naked baby&quot; - no decoration. Seeing the beautiful hairpins, hats and scarves, Zhou Zhou wanted to buy them for his doll. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;She also buys clothes for Wanzi. At first, she just bought some baby clothes, but she felt that the sizes were always a bit off. Later, I simply went to customize some clothes like I did with the &quot;group purchase&quot; dolls, but the price was slightly more expensive and the cycle would be longer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhou Zhou said that in addition to dressing up dolls, she sometimes also &quot;makes things happen&quot;. For example, when doing homework, let Wanzi accompany you, and then record the conversation as a video and upload it to the Internet platform. &quot;While doing homework, I asked Wanzi, isn&#39;t your father a doctor? Can you know this question?&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the circle, those dolls with character prototypes are called &quot;dolls with attributes&quot;. The character prototype of Wanzi comes from a female-oriented online game. In the game, a female character played by Zhou Zhou falls in love with a doctor named Charlie Su, and Wanzi is the fruit of love. &quot;The Maruko doll is a baby in the three-dimensional world. This kind of companionship and sustenance has a sense of reality and makes me feel very happy.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In real life, I have never seen a boy as good as Charlie Sue.&quot; The character setting of Charlie Sue is romance, kindness, and respect for women. Zhou Zhou said that there are five male protagonists in the game. She didn&#39;t pay attention to Charlie Su at first, but she was gradually attracted by his attentiveness, especially when she saw a book &quot;Fang Siqi&#39;s First Love Paradise&quot; hidden in Charlie Su&#39;s study. 》, I was instantly moved by this detail. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhou Zhou is a &quot;science and engineering girl&quot; majoring in biology. She is a sophomore in Hefei, Anhui and has never been in a relationship in real life. &quot;Every day when I open Weibo and Tik Tok, there are warnings of &#39;marriage fear&#39;.&quot; She said that as a woman, she often senses unfriendly behavior from the outside world, which makes her cautious about entering a relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Cotton dolls often play a role in expressing emotions for children, and these emotions have a wide range of aspects. &quot;I have lacked companionship since I was a child.&quot; Zhitao explained that she grew up in a single-parent family. Her mother ran a factory by herself. She was usually very busy and had to go home very late every day. During her long teenage years, she spent her time alone at home watching TV, scrolling through her cell phone, and reading comic books. &quot;On May Day, I actually wanted to go back, but when I went back, I would be alone at home. It would be better to stay alone in the dormitory.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Except for the road Fei, Shibatao also ordered a prototype doll named Kageyama Shigeo, the male protagonist of the Japanese anime &quot;Mob Psycho 100&quot;. Kageyama Shigeo has super powers and can help many people, but he feels inferior and depressed because he is not good at dealing with people. Through painful growth, he slowly accepts his imperfect self. &quot;Luffy and Kageyama Shigeo are two sides of my personality.&quot; Shibato said, putting the two dolls of Luffy and Kageyama Shigeo on the bedside, and she felt very at ease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Some doll friends will decorate doll houses for cotton dolls.

(Photo provided by interviewee)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Baby’s mother: “If no one sells it, I will make it myself”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhitao’s memories, give After Luffy&#39;s birthday, she secretly posted the photo on QQ space, which few people paid attention to, and occasionally looked through it herself, &quot;mainly because I was afraid that others wouldn&#39;t understand and would criticize you.&quot; Therefore, when the controversy over the Haidilao incident came out, she was so sensitive that she quickly deleted this trace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;She is grateful for the appearance of Cotton Doll, allowing her to find similar people who can understand each other&#39;s behavior. Zhitao explained that the most popular cotton doll is the most popular animation, game, drama series or &quot;idol&quot; at the moment. Because it has just become popular, the peripheral products are not perfect enough. If fans want to express their love, they need to DIY. Make emotional cotton dolls. &quot;There are few ways to express emotions, so just make it yourself.&quot; Among them, they are divided into nurturing dolls and idol dolls, which are to raise the dolls like children, or to pursue them like celebrities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Slightly different from the outside world’s perception, anime “popular idols” like Luffy have many fans, but they are not actually the most popular dolls. &quot;Because &quot;One Piece&quot; has been popular for a long time, there are so many peripherals, and there are many choices.&quot; Shigeo Kageyama, who Shimomo also likes, is not a popular doll either, because this anime is a little old, but it is relatively unpopular. I know it and like it. There are not many people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;So, when Zhitao sees posts or merchandise about her favorite characters on social media, she will feel very happy, &quot;Ah, I didn&#39;t expect such unpopularity.&quot; characters, but also dolls.” She introduced that there will be like-minded people on social platforms who post posts to solicit fans and buy cotton dolls together in groups. If fans are interested, they take the initiative to contact the poster, and then they are pulled into a group buying group on an e-commerce platform to communicate. &quot;At least 50 people can be recruited to form a group.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This sponsor is called &quot;baby mother&quot; by children&#39;s friends. &quot;Baby mothers are like fans in the rice circle, and they are actually fans.&quot; She explained that usually cotton dolls are usually designed by the mother in advance by someone or herself. The pattern and size of the doll will be announced in advance and everyone&#39;s opinions will be solicited. , if you are dissatisfied with the design, you can make suggestions for modifications. After the final draft is finalized, the baby&#39;s mother will go to the factory to make a sample. Once the sample is satisfactory, it can be shipped. This cycle usually takes several months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Usually more than 900 yuan for a sample.&quot; Tongmian (online name) is the legendary baby mother. She said that before starting a group, she must first Draw sketches, because I have some basic drawing skills, so I make my own design draft. After finishing the painting, I post it to social platforms to find people. The jargon is called &quot;squatting&quot;. We will see if there are many interested people. If we can find some people, we will start to form a group. After joining the group for discussion one after another, we will go to the factory to make prototypes. &quot;If you are satisfied, we will make the goods. If you are not satisfied, we will continue to make samples. You can make samples up to three times.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Tong Mian said that she does this job part-time, which is equivalent to generating electricity for love. At first, she liked the character Qi Sili in the game &quot;Love of Light and Night&quot; very much, so she wanted to own a doll, but she searched all major e-commerce platforms and found nothing. &quot;No one sold it, so I decided to make it myself.&quot; After the doll is ready, the total cost of the doll plus postage is 70 yuan, and the co-sleeper will also give you some trinkets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the communication group, in addition to exchanging opinions on drawings and samples, the baby&#39;s mother will also announce the production progress, communication details with the factory owner, and cost details. The whole process is more like DIY for fans. Mothers will gain a sense of accomplishment when they see their ideas turn into reality little by little. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Enterprise: “Niche, too small batch size”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhitao discovered that a mother with a baby clearly stated in the group announcement that she refused to Adults &quot;start a group&quot;. &quot;A doll costs tens of dollars, which is quite expensive. I&#39;m afraid that it has already left the factory, and parents find it too expensive to return it.&quot; She explained that the number of doll friends who like a specific character is already small. As far as the factory is concerned, Their order quantity is too small, which is the minimum limit that can be started for production. &quot;Baby mothers use love to generate electricity. If they return the goods, they have to pay for it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;So, although a doll costs fifty or sixty yuan, It&#39;s not cheap, but Zhitao thinks it&#39;s reasonable. &quot;After all, there are too few people who like this.&quot; She said that some big IPs have very rich derivatives and a wide range of choices, while peripherals for niche hobbies can only be obtained through DIY methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The entrepreneur Feng He (pseudonym) is not an animation fan or a fan. He noticed that the cotton doll was not a hobby, but an instinctive business sense. However, after entering this track, he gradually realized why this new thing appeared in the form of fan groups. &quot;It is mainly a niche, quite special, and not as easy to do as imagined.&quot; Feng He is the founder of a cotton doll company in Zhongshan, Guangdong. At first, he found a factory to make the dolls, but later he purchased a machine to make the dolls himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The main difficulty is that the batch size is too small.&quot; Feng He said that there are many categories of cotton dolls, but the production quantity of a single category is very limited. There are a large number of toy OEM factories in the Pearl River Delta, but for them, the number of each order is too small. &quot;They mainly take orders from foreign countries, mainly exporting.&quot; When he first got involved in this industry, he had to communicate frequently with factories, which consumed a lot of time and energy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, Feng He was still unwilling to miss this emerging market, so he established a company, bought machines, and decided to open a factory and do it himself. “The most important costs are personnel and management costs.” He said that a mature sample maker’s monthly salary is at least 8,000 yuan, a machine tool master needs 6,800 yuan, and embroidery workers and handymen’s monthly salary is more than 6,000 yuan. A mature embroiderer can sew up to 40 dolls a day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Even if the factory has been opened, the way they receive orders is still to post posts and gather enough people before starting a group. Depending on the size of the doll and the quantity of the group, the pricing will be different, with the range mostly fluctuating by tens of yuan. &quot;Although it is very popular now, in the big market of dolls, it is a very small segment.&quot; He said that cotton dolls are actually an upgrade of the manufacturing industry. After the growth of large-volume export trade slowed down, only There is a way out to undertake this type of small batch and multi-batch demand, which puts forward higher requirements for corporate management and cost control. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Even if external entrepreneurs gradually intervene, flexibility and smallness are still the characteristics of this industry. Data from an e-commerce platform shows that the number of cotton doll merchants with transaction records has increased from less than 400 in 2017 to nearly 10,000 by the end of 2020, an increase of more than 20 times in three years. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Brand&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;:&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;The first question is&lt;/strong >;&lt;strong>;Copyright&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Xiao Qi (screen name) is also a cotton doll lover. I work in a small cotton doll company near the water and have collected more than 20 dolls. As a serious gamer, she would change the doll&#39;s bangs and clothes, put blush on her face, and check in and take photos at Internet celebrity coffee shops. She also made space on the wardrobe and built a &quot;baby house&quot;. She followed the tutorials on social media to hang hooks, pictures and other props to decorate the doll&#39;s room. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;With the development of the industry, the cotton doll accessories industry chain has developed. On the e-commerce platform, there are all kinds of jewelry, baby clothes, shoes, blush, as well as baby bags, baby houses, furniture and other peripheral accessories for cotton dolls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Limited by the exclusivity of the audience for attribute dolls, many cotton dolls cannot be mass-produced, but many accessories can be used universally without copyright risk. , on the contrary, mass production will be realized earlier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;As I get older, playing with Barbie is a bit childish, and Cotton Doll is just right.&quot; Xiaoqi is not a fan of fans or animation, she mainly likes Cotton Doll It was to fulfill my childhood dream of being a princess. Her more than 20 cotton dolls are all non-attributed dolls, with no corresponding IP prototypes and no copyright authorization issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;To take the branding route, the first problem to solve is copyright.&quot; Rua Baby Bar founder Ye Yingdan was the first to notice that cotton dolls could grow into an industry one of the people. Ye Yingdan was originally a marketing director of an e-commerce platform. As early as 2019, she monitored in the background data that &quot;cotton doll&quot; became a hot-searched product as a keyword. After careful study, we found that cotton dolls are a very interesting category. The products are soft and cute. No matter the designers, manufacturers or the audience, they are all very young, mostly middle school and college students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The cotton dolls purchased in 2018 are based on a Korean boy band.

(Southern Weekend reporter Gao Yichen/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The whole thing is still in a relatively rough stage.&quot; Ye Yingdan said that because it is mainly a product driven by interest, early group DIY The cotton dolls are shared by fans and are not strictly commercial activities, so they do not involve strict copyright issues. Of course, the quantity of a single category is also very limited, and the production cycle is very long. Even a few months after the group was launched, the product has not yet been released. Some baby friends have even forgotten about it. There have been cases where the baby&#39;s mother &quot;ran away with the money.&quot; Condition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The supply chain ecology is very backward, and the upstream cannot solve the problem of genuine authorization, and the development of the entire market is very restricted.&quot; Ye Yingdan explained that despite the many problems, she Still see the vigorous development. That year, Cotton Doll’s GMV (total transaction volume within a period of time) on their platform grew by more than 300% in one year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From the star-chasing culture that originated in South Korea to quietly becoming popular in China, it quickly expanded to various circles of animation, film and television, and games, and developed its own Circle culture. Ye Yingdan feels that this industry has great potential and she wants to create a brand of cotton dolls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Ye Yingdan found that a major difficulty in the early stages of starting a business was how to accurately select IP with sustainable commercial value, &quot;Because the cotton doll itself has a prototype, and the product is not It is not the brand that takes the lead, but the product that is created by the fans of the character.” After exploration, we found that compared to idols and animation, the IP of film and television dramas is more suitable for brand operation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;We go to the market to check the hot dramas that are waiting to be broadcast, and try our best to &#39;sign all the ones that should be signed&#39; to ensure that we continue to produce peripherals for popular characters in TV dramas. .&quot; Ye Yingdan said that branded cotton dolls can only cover the characters that are popular and highly recognized by the public, while many unpopular IPs still require hobbyists to DIY them. Therefore, in the future, the group-style small workshop model will still exist for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 09:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“直博生主动选择博转硕”背后：博士过剩正在愈演愈烈丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259693]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;According to the &quot;China Youth Daily&quot; report, &quot;direct doctoral students actively choose to convert from Ph.D. to master&#39;s degree&quot; has become a new phenomenon in colleges and universities. The reporter interviewed several direct doctoral students. Their reasons for choosing to &quot;transfer to a master&#39;s degree&quot; vary: some are not suitable for PhD life, some are because the subject is too difficult, and some are worried about their employment after graduation. For them, changing to a master&#39;s degree or simply entering the workplace is an &quot;active diversion.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why these doctoral students choose to quit is naturally due to rational considerations of cost-benefit ratio. If the subject is too difficult and they cannot get a degree even after studying for several years, the resulting sunk cost will be staggering; even if they go through all the hard work to get a doctorate, if they cannot find a job after graduation, the opportunity cost they will pay will be astonishing. It is bound to be too big to bear; even if they work hard to get a teaching position, many &quot;green peppers&quot; still have to fight hard to escape from the various &quot;promote or leave&quot; assessment quagmire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to imagine that a doctoral student spends several years studying for a degree, and then tries his best to find a stable scientific research and teaching position. This is an out-and-out &quot;adventure&quot;, while his peers I&#39;m afraid I have spent the past few years getting married and starting a business. In comparison, studying for a Ph.D. is indeed like a &quot;gamble&quot;. It was based on these considerations that several parties involved in the report decisively chose to &quot;stop losses&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind this phenomenon is the problem of &quot;mismatch&quot; and &quot;excess&quot; in the selection and training of domestic doctoral students. The so-called &quot;mismatch&quot; means that many students who are not suitable for Ph.D. study mistakenly enter the path of Ph.D., and after enrolling, they are shocked to realize that they are not the material; the so-called &quot;surplus&quot; means that there are too many doctoral students trained by universities, showing an oversupply situation. The society cannot provide enough jobs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the first batch of doctoral students independently trained in China received their degrees in 1983, the number of doctoral students recruited and graduated every year in the country has been growing rapidly for the past 40 years. According to the Ministry of Education&#39;s &quot;2022 National Education Development Statistical Bulletin&quot;, a total of 82,300 doctoral students will graduate in 2022. This year, the number of doctoral student enrollment exceeded the 130,000 mark, and the number of doctoral students reached 556,100. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a vertical perspective, China&#39;s doctoral student enrollment exceeded 10,000 in 1995, reached 60,000 in 2009, and reached 130,000 in 2022. In less than thirty years, the number has surged by more than a dozen. times; horizontally, China surpassed the United States as the world&#39;s largest doctorate-granting country as early as 2008, and currently the number of new doctorates awarded each year exceeds that of the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, the number of people enrolling and graduating with doctoral degrees in China reaches new highs every year; on the other hand, the “superfluity of doctoral students” is becoming more and more serious. News about &quot;PhDs in nuclear physics becoming urban managers&quot;, &quot;Doctors in medicine applying for school doctors&quot; and &quot;PhD students vying for primary and secondary school teachers&quot; appear frequently. The dilemma of &quot;green pepper collective anxiety&quot; often shows the embarrassment of doctoral students being &quot;overqualified for their talents&quot; in the job market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why is there a surplus of doctoral students? This is related to social needs, traditional concepts, and policy guidance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Society’s demand for doctoral students often changes with the economic situation and industrial structure. Once the &quot;demand side&quot; of society cannot create enough scientific research and teaching positions, it will not be able to accommodate enough PhD employment. If PhDs in science and engineering can still find use in corporate R&amp;D departments, PhDs in humanities and social sciences may only have public and teaching positions left to fight for, and these positions are one carrot after another, and the growth rate is limited after all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The traditional Chinese concept is that &quot;those who excel in learning will become officials&quot;. It seems that contemporary Ph.D.s, like the ancient scholars, belong to the reserve army of public officials. Standing at the entrance of the ivory tower, the first-year Ph.D. students regard &quot;Doctor&quot; as a status and even a talisman, and are &quot;on the waiting list&quot; like &quot;passing the Jinshi examination&quot;. In reality, the &quot;grading advantage&quot; of doctoral students joining civil servants is also reinforcing this concept. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, modern society is not ancient times after all. The rapidly growing number of doctoral students far exceeds the imperial examination quota of only a few hundred people a year in the past. The number of public positions that the society can accommodate may not keep up with the excess number of doctoral graduates. . If the relationship between &quot;social demand&quot; and &quot;doctoral supply&quot; cannot be realized, then the starting point of students&#39; doctoral studies will inevitably be out of touch with the connotation of a doctoral degree, and they will become farther and farther away from the &quot;original intention&quot; of a doctoral degree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ph.D. degrees, from the outset, are different from other degrees in the education system. Pursuing a doctorate is known as an arduous journey of &quot;studying alone at the farthest edge of knowledge&quot;. Those who obtain a doctorate are also hailed as &quot;creating new knowledge for mankind&quot;, which means that they can independently complete research and expand humankind. cognitive boundaries. A vivid description is that if the human knowledge system is regarded as a concentric circle with a radius that is constantly expanding outward, then a doctor is someone who touches the outermost circle and makes a breakthrough outward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The demand for doctoral students in modern society often changes with the economic situation and industrial structure. Changes on the demand side should naturally force adjustments on the supply side. In the face of changes in social needs, universities should proactively adjust their doctoral training plans. Public universities must make good use of taxpayers&#39; higher education funds, and private universities must be worthy of large donations from alumni. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take the United States as an example. The financial pressure brought about by the COVID-19 impact has caused many prestigious universities in the United States to reduce enrollment or even suspend enrollment in many doctoral programs. Doctorates in liberal arts who do not make money are the first to bear the brunt. According to U.S. media statistics, in 2021 alone, dozens of elite universities in the United States have suspended enrollment in more than 140 doctoral programs in the humanities and social sciences. After the emergence of the large language model ChatGPT, doctoral majors in the field of artificial intelligence have won a new round of favor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Are you suitable for a PhD? Does the doctoral team need you? Does society need you as a doctoral student? If you answer these questions carefully, pursuing a doctorate can be called a &quot;two-way journey.&quot; At the same time, universities should also think deeply about how to proactively adjust the enrollment and training plans for doctoral students in response to social needs, instead of &quot;cultivating PhDs like mushrooms&quot;, which will lead to the problems of degree involution and a surplus of PhDs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
