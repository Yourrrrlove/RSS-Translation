In October, he was awarded a doctorate in history from Fudan University. Together with Zhou Zhenhe, he was among the first batch of liberal arts graduates in the country. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;In 1985, he was appointed associate professor; in 1991, he was appointed professor; in 1993, he was appointed doctoral supervisor. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;From 1996 to 2007, he served as the director of the Chinese Institute of Historical Geography. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;From 1999 to 2007, he concurrently served as the director of the Historical Geography Research Center, a key research base of the Ministry of Education. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;From 2007 to 2014, he served as the Director of the Library of Fudan University. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;From 2008 to 2018, he served as a member of the Standing Committee of the 11th and 12th National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;In 2014, he was appointed as a senior professor of liberal arts at Fudan University. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;In 2016, he was hired as a librarian of the Central Research Institute of Literature and History and a librarian of the Shanghai Research Institute of Literature and History. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Retired in January 2020. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 1978, green crops and soybeans were planted on the lawn of Fudan University. 32-year-old Ge Jianxiong entered the school and became a graduate student in historical geography. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than two months later, there were more lectures, and &quot;ballroom dancing&quot; became popular on campus. Ge Jianxiong, who was among them, also felt the vigorous vitality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Returning to college is not easy. In December 1945, Ge Jianxiong was born in Nanxun Town, Wuxing, Zhejiang. He hoped to apply for the classical literature major at Peking University, but he was diagnosed with lung disease during a physical examination in his sophomore year of high school, and his studies were forced to interrupt. After losing the chance to take the college entrance examination twice in a row, he followed the teacher&#39;s advice and began training for teaching qualifications while preparing to take the college entrance examination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 1965, Ge Jianxiong officially became an English teacher at Shanghai Gutian Middle School. He thought he would be able to enter college after his health recovered, but instead he received news that the university had suspended admissions. Ge Jianxiong has spent more than ten years teaching at Gutian Middle School. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The college entrance examination was resumed in 1977, and the age limit for taking the exam was 30 years old. The 31-year-old Ge Jianxiong was not eligible to take the exam. In 1978, graduate student enrollment was resumed and the age limit was relaxed to 40 years old, allowing Ge Jianxiong to quietly sign up. With a high school education, he was admitted to the History Department of Fudan University with the first score in the preliminary examination, and studied historical geography under Mr. Tan Qixiang. A few years later, by chance, Ge Jianxiong and his fellow student Zhou Zhenhe became the first two PhDs in history independently trained by China after the reform and opening up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ge Jianxiong often mentioned Mr. Tan Qixiang’s ingenious metaphor about historical geography: If history is a drama, then geography is the stage, and history cannot work without this stage. Mentioning the relevance of this subject to ordinary people, Ge Jianxiong said that historical geography is omnipresent. &quot;Whether it is the changes in the natural environment or the development of human geography, such as today&#39;s folk customs and intangible cultural heritage, they are all products of the historical geographical environment.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the reason why he entered historical geography, Ge Jianxiong explained that even if he liked history since childhood, it was just a manifestation of blind curiosity in his youth until he became a graduate student at Fudan University in October 1978 and stayed at the school to work three years later. , only then decided to take historical geography as a lifelong career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ge Jianxiong is also a scholar with quite a personality. He often said, &quot;Don&#39;t be a nerd, don&#39;t be a hypocrite.&quot; Whether as a scholar or a member of the CPPCC, he always expressed his views outspokenly. In addition, he has traveled to Antarctica as a member of China&#39;s 17th Antarctic Expedition, climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, the &quot;King of Africa&quot;, and visited Ali, Tibet, the &quot;Roof of the World&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the last day of the National Day holiday in 2023, a Southern Weekend reporter met Ge Jianxiong in a bookstore on University Road in Shanghai. The 77-year-old man is white-haired and slightly stooped. He is wearing a dark blue cotton and linen shirt and dark gray trousers. He is carrying a white canvas bag filled with documents and books. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Missed the college entrance examination&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;You once mentioned that you were unable to take the college entrance examination due to physical reasons in high school. What was the situation like at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;My goal in high school was to major in classical literature at Peking University, but I was diagnosed with lung disease in May of my second semester of high school. Due to widespread malnutrition, three people in our class were diagnosed with lung disease. My condition was the most serious and I had to suspend school. I originally thought that I would be able to start my senior year of high school in time after taking a three-month break, but after an examination, I found that the lesions were not completely absorbed, so I ended up taking a year and a half out of school and studying with the next class in my senior year of high school. In May 1964, I still failed the physical examination for the college entrance examination and was unable to register. Under such circumstances, I could only work as a social youth, but my teacher suggested that I join the workforce. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What work have you done and what do you hope for the future? Planning? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Shanghai Institute of Education was running a teaching qualification training course at that time, which was equivalent to a one-year college. We were sent to various key schools to receive training, and after one year we were officially assigned as teachers. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, I planned to become a teacher first, and wait until I recovered before taking the college entrance examination. I trained at my alma mater, Shibei Middle School. I like literature and history, and I wanted to teach Chinese. But the teacher in charge of my class was the Chinese teacher. He said that the Chinese teacher had to correct the compositions of two classes and the burden was too heavy. He knew that I planned to enter college and suggested that I teach English so that I could have more spare time for self-study. After one year of internship, on August 5, 1965, I reported to Gutian Middle School and officially became a teacher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What other preparations have you made for the college entrance examination? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Not long after I started working, in September 1965, the night school department of Shanghai International Studies University enrolled students, and I applied. Starting from October of that year, we had English classes two nights a week. I thought I would have the opportunity to enter university after working for two years, but when the Cultural Revolution began in 1966 and the university closed down, my hope was dashed. The university resumed enrollment in 1977, but the age requirement was 30 years old. I was over the age and had no chance. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Applying for graduate school with a high school degree, similar exceptions are available for admission Was it common at the time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When the country resumed postgraduate enrollment, the &quot;People&#39;s Daily&quot; published an article proposing to reduce talents in any way. Many regulations have been broken. For example, a high school diploma is required to enter college, but nothing is required to enter graduate school. The age is also relaxed to 40 years old. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was reported in the news at that time that some people graduated from elementary school and were admitted to graduate school. There was also a Shandong student who had studied with his father since he was a child and had never set foot on campus and was admitted to graduate school. The oldest among the first batch of graduate students was Qian Liqun, who was born in 1939, and the youngest recruited by Fudan was born in 1957. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You originally wanted to study classical philology, but why did you apply for Fudan University? Historical geography? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I got married in March 1978 and registered for the exam in May or June. My wife wanted me to stay in Shanghai. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I really wanted to study classical philology when I was in high school, but later I found that history was more practical and safer. I didn’t know what historical geography was at first, but I liked both history and geography, so I applied for this subject. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Did the application process go smoothly? What was your mentality at the time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I prepared quietly for the first test and did not dare to tell the employer. I don&#39;t place any hope on the exam. If I can pass it, I will take it. If I fail, I won&#39;t be ashamed. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The examination room was at Shanghai Institute of Technology, which is now the Yanchang Road campus of Shanghai University, two or three kilometers away from Gutian Middle School. At eight o&#39;clock in the morning, I organized the flag-raising on the school radio and lectured the students. It took about a quarter of an hour to complete these tasks, and then I rode a bicycle for ten minutes to take the exam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the preliminary test results came out, I ranked first. Only after I was able to take the re-examination did I start preparing seriously. I went to the public reading room of the Shanghai Library to borrow professional reference books, such as &quot;Selected Readings of Ancient Chinese Geography Classics&quot;. At that time, there was only one copy. It had been borrowed when I went there on the first day. I went to borrow it very early the next day to get it. , and it was also at this time that I met the classmates who later re-examined together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in fact, middle school has known it for a long time. After I enrolled in the school, the old branch secretary of the school accidentally told me that after seeing the preliminary test scores, Fudan University suspected that I had falsified my high school diploma and had sent someone to Gutian Middle School to learn about the situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You had been working at Gutian Middle School for more than ten years when you were admitted to graduate school. Did you Are you still worried that the school won’t let you go? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes. I was responsible for student affairs at the school and also served as the full-time Youth League Committee Secretary. I introduced the first batch of League members in the school. In 1977, I was selected as an advanced worker in education in Shanghai, and later became a deputy to the Shanghai Municipal People’s Congress. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the leaders of the Zhabei District Education Bureau specifically called the school to express their attitude - if I am admitted to graduate school, it means that the country needs me to go to graduate school more, and the school must release me unconditionally. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/8CTAl7WVPMKw6hkp1USDjvszLxnrwA6urOi61djs.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;614&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/8CTAl7WVPMKw6hkp1USDjvszLxnrwA6urOi61djs.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257127&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In October 1983, President Xie Xide of Fudan University (left) awarded Ge Jianxiong a doctorate degree. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Exceptional award of doctorate degree&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;October 1978 was the time you entered school. Was there any change in the atmosphere at the school at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Not long after we entered school, the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee was held, and the school ushered in earth-shaking changes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I first entered Fudan, green crops were still growing on the school lawn, and bright red big-character posters were posted on the main road, Nanjing Road. After the plenary session, the big-character posters were removed, scar literature caused heated debates among students, and more and more lectures were given. Some students proposed improving the treatment of intellectuals. While the views they put forward were not necessarily mainstream, they were passionate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deng Xiaoping’s speech proposed that it must be ensured that scientific and technological personnel must spend at least five-sixths of their time in business work a week. Our political study time has been significantly reduced, to half a day a week. In the past, we would have meetings and study all day long, and individuals had to attend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What are the course arrangements after enrollment? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;During the master’s period, the school offers public courses, including politics and foreign languages. I chose English, German and Japanese. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Tan offers professional courses. When he enrolled, Mr. Tan was still hospitalized. He gave us the first class in the foyer of Shanghai Longhua Hospital. After two lectures, I thought the foyer was too noisy. Mr. Tan happened to have a student working at the Shanghai Dictionary Publishing House, so he asked someone to find a house for the publishing house near Longhua Hospital. In this way, Mr. Tan gave us a semester of professional courses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The school does not offer other professional courses and requires tutors and departments to resolve the issues themselves. Most of the courses are offered by tutors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have geography internships starting from this year. In 1979, two teachers took five of us graduate students to Yangzhou, Zhenjiang and Nanjing to conduct formal &quot;academic mountain climbing&quot; and observe geological structures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You chose to stay in school after graduation and started working and studying at the same time Bo, what&#39;s the opportunity in this? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After I graduated with my master&#39;s degree, I was assigned a job. My family is in Shanghai, so I stayed in school smoothly, serving as Mr. Tan&#39;s assistant and undertaking scientific research tasks. In the spring of 1982, the country began to officially recruit doctoral students. At that time, doctoral supervisors had to go to Beijing for evaluation. It was not until 1992 that Peking University, Tsinghua, Fudan and other universities could evaluate at their own school, and they had to report to the Ministry of Education for registration. After Mr. Tan was named a doctoral supervisor in 1981, he recruited Zhou Zhenhe and me in 1982. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the whole, the number of doctoral students recruited in the first batch is very small, with only a dozen or so in the Liberal Arts Department of Fudan University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;As the first batch of Ph.D.s, what is your training method? Is there a relatively clear training plan? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There is no standardized training method, and I don’t know what the above requirements are. After discussing with us, Mr. Tan decided to study on his own first and ask him for advice if he had any questions. Since I am his assistant and follow him all day long, I can ask for advice at any time. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because the number of doctoral students is small, the school does not offer courses specifically for doctoral students, so we don’t know what courses are available. However, considering that there is a thesis requirement for doctoral graduation, we began to prepare the doctoral thesis shortly after the semester started in 1982. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In September 1983, after more than a year of doctoral studies, you and Zhou Zhenhe was specially approved by the Ministry of Education to graduate early, which seems incredible today. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In May 1983, the first batch of Ph.D.s in science appeared in China. The evaluation is based on the master&#39;s thesis, and if it reaches the doctoral level, it can be recognized as a doctorate. At that time, 18 people from across the country passed, and 4 from Fudan, namely Hong Jiaxing, Zhang Yinnan, Tong Yusun and Li Shaokuan. At the meeting of the school’s academic degree committee, Mr. Tan asked whether Zhou Zhenhe’s and I’s papers could also be recognized as doctoral thesis because they were also of high quality. However, Principal Su Buqing objected. He believed that the expressions of science subjects such as mathematics and physics have international standards, while liberal arts are Chinese subjects and have no international standards. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, the school already had the first batch of science Ph.D.s, but no liberal arts Ph.D.s. If you wanted to strengthen your strength, this was an entry point. Jiang Yihua, the then department chair, learned that Tsinghua University and Peking University did not yet have liberal arts PhDs, so he asked whether Fudan could strive to cultivate the first batch of liberal arts PhDs in China. They specifically approached the Vice Minister of Education Huang Xinbai, and the result was that exceptions could be made, but all courses must meet the standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How do you meet the standards required by the Ministry of Education? No twists and turns? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Zhou Zhenhe and I completed the closed-book politics exam. For professional courses, Mr. Tan prepared test papers based on our situation. In addition, foreign language scores are also required. Zhou Zhenhe and I both took English and Japanese during our master&#39;s degrees, and our Japanese scores were over 80 points. We proposed that the first foreign language test be English, and the second foreign language should be replaced by the Japanese scores during the master&#39;s degree. The Ministry of Education agreed. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the thesis defense in August 1983, we invited Hou Renzhi and Shi Nianhai. However, after the defense date was set, the written approval from the Ministry of Education for our early graduation has not yet been issued. When the school learned that Huang Xinbai was having a meeting in Harbin, it sent someone to Harbin to find him to sign. The night before the defense, they made a long-distance call and said that our defense was &quot;legal&quot; only after Huang Xinbai approved it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The degree awarding ceremony will be held in September. At that time, the doctoral certificates were numbered nationwide. The first 18 numbers were for science. Zhou Zhenhe was numbered 19th and I was numbered 20th. With a clear conscience, although we graduated early as an exception, we did not take things lightly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is another episode. We were supposed to have professional titles after graduation, but due to the rectification of professional titles, it was not until 1985 that the assessment of professional titles was resumed, and Zhou Zhenhe and I were promoted to associate professors. I was named a professor in 1991 and became a doctoral supervisor in 1993. From the time I was studying for a Ph.D. to becoming a professor, I was able to continue doing academic work. If not for the reform and opening up, I would never have had these opportunities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/5gv0PjMm2R0vUVItxmyHEVQp06V6hOrmR2hxAVs3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;698&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/5gv0PjMm2R0vUVItxmyHEVQp06V6hOrmR2hxAVs3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257128&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In May 1981, Ge Jianxiong (3rd from left) and his mentor Tan Qixiang (2nd from left), Zhou Youguang (1st from right) and Zhang Yunhe (1st from left). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;How come toys must make you lose your mind? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You often mentioned Mr. Tan’s opinions on acting and The metaphor of a stage, so what is the value and significance behind studying the stage where history takes place? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Historical geography is the study of geographical conditions in historical periods, including natural topography such as mountains, rivers, and humanities, Such as politics, economy and culture. The stage is an abstract metaphor, which actually refers to all geographical conditions, geographical elements and geographical distribution in the past. The value behind it lies in how we apply it. It is a science in itself and an objective law. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For the discipline of historical geography, What did it mean for you to receive your PhD in 1983? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Everyone agrees that historical geography was basically formed in the 1980s. But for a subject to become a knowledge, at least there must be people studying the basic fields. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the Fudan University Library held its centenary exhibition, it asked me for a topic, and it was finally decided to be &quot;The Legend of the End of the Fire&quot;. I took out a few exhibits. The first one is Mr. Tan&#39;s university graduation thesis - &quot;History of Chinese Immigration&quot;. His instructor was Mr. Pan Guangdan. This manuscript also contains Pan Guangdan&#39;s comments. The second item is a six-volume history of Chinese immigration that I edited. The third thing is the books published by my students on the history of Chinese population and Chinese immigration. There are about six kinds of books. There are also many doctoral theses written by their students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our four generations have focused on the topic of Chinese immigration history, from unpublished university thesis manuscripts, to compiled six volumes, to so many papers, and we have truly passed it down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Combined with your own experience and feelings, the development of historical geography and What is the connection between reform and opening up? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In general, historical geography used to be a very small subject. Later, thanks to Mr. Tan&#39;s &quot;Atlas of Chinese History&quot; and everyone&#39;s continuous efforts after the reform and opening up, the social visibility of the subject was improved. If he could not seek truth from facts when studying historical geography, Mr. Tan would be very painful. However, the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee restored the line of seeking truth from facts. On such a major issue as historical maps, Mr. Tan received support from the central government. Mr. Tan was very moved. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After so many years of research, what is your understanding of historical geography? What deeper understanding has there been of the subject? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After entering this discipline, I feel that the development of the discipline is inseparable from the line of seeking truth from facts. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Marx’s historical materialism fully affirms the role of material foundation in history, and historical geography studies the stage and material foundation of history. If Marxist materialism can be used as technical guidance, historical and geographical research can naturally serve reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some major issues can be explained from the perspective of historical geography, while exploring the positive and negative roles played by geographical conditions in the process of historical development. For example, Mr. Tan proposed in 1962 that the fundamental reason for the long-term steady flow of the Yellow River after the Eastern Han Dynasty was the change in land use patterns in the middle reaches, which greatly reduced soil erosion. The good degree of vegetation maintenance in the middle reaches of the Yellow River determines the severity of soil erosion. Therefore, farming or animal husbandry in the middle reaches directly affects the safety of the lower reaches of the Yellow River. He proposed that the middle reaches of the Yellow River cannot be all engaged in agriculture, and should be adapted to local conditions. Farming should be done if it is suitable for agriculture, pastoral should be used for grazing, and forest should be used for forestry. It needs to be comprehensively developed and utilized comprehensively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although this view has been criticized, its advanced accuracy has been fully proven after the reform and opening up. This is now the case in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, with some returning farmland to forests and some returning farmland to grassland. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After becoming a doctoral supervisor in 1993, based on your past life experiences, you What are the differences in admissions? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I am an eclectic person, and several students were recruited with the approval of the school. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like my student Ma Menglong, he failed the doctoral entrance examination, but after talking with him, I found that he has great potential, has strong logical thinking, and is very good at using his brain. I encouraged him to go back and review before taking the exam. Later, I felt that it was not enough to let him review by himself, so I decided to recruit him specially. The school stipulates that academicians and tutors who have produced hundreds of outstanding doctoral theses across the country can be specially recruited. I took advantage of this right and came up with the questions myself. After he answered the questions, I graded the results and handed the papers to the school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first year of recruitment, Ma Menglong couldn’t understand the class and was very anxious. I advised him not to worry, I believe you can follow me. Later, he slowly came to his senses, and his graduation thesis was of a very high standard, and even won the top 100 in the country. If I were not given autonomy, this kind of student would never be able to get in. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Fudan has this tradition, which stipulates that academicians and doctoral supervisors who have produced top 100 papers have the right to recruit special talents. Then we should make full use of this right to discover special talents. As Mr. Tan advocates, on the one hand, we must abide by the system, but on the other hand, we must leave room for special circumstances. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In addition to academic research, Notice You is also a mobile game Academic consultants participate in the construction of the historical values ​​​​of the game. What is your original intention for doing this, and how do you understand the relationship between play and learning? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;We need to correct a misconception. In ancient times, it was said that playing with things makes you lose your morale. How come playing with things must make you lose your morale? Can you keep your ambition without playing? Modern society is all about production, material rather than spiritual, but people have the right to play, and citizens&#39; right to play should be protected. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But don’t expect to learn history by playing, that’s ridiculous. A nation that does not pay attention to history is pathetic, and a nation that can only learn history through games is even more pathetic. History is very serious and must be studied seriously. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I serve as an academic advisor for mobile games, just to make sure that the values ​​of the game are okay. As long as the game is harmless, it is fine, but the values ​​​​must be correct. I once suggested to them to avoid causing harm to young people, and later strengthened supervision through secondary certification. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 05 Nov 2023 18:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“小姐姐报警称被同行人抛弃”：做旅游搭子应摒弃巨婴心态丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260007]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-05 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, an incident in which &quot;a young lady called the police and claimed that she was abandoned by a travel partner&quot; has attracted public attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 27, a woman posted a video on social media, saying in tears that &quot;she was abandoned by her travel partner&quot; and that she had already called the police. According to her description, there were five people in this &quot;travel group&quot;, including a couple and two men besides her. The group started traveling by car from Chengdu, and Daocheng Yading was the last stop. We originally agreed to drive back to Chengdu in the evening after climbing the mountain on the 27th. The woman involved said that when she came back at seven o&#39;clock that night, she found that the other four people had abandoned her and gone back first, and had stored her luggage in the hotel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 29, events took a turn. Another woman who was traveling with her posted a clarification, pointing out several facts. First, the pick-up group had repeatedly emphasized to the woman in advance that they would meet at the foot of the mountain at 16:30 that day and then drive back to Chengdu, but the woman ultimately ignored this; second, everyone urged her many times to no avail and could not contact her. at 18:30, she finally gave up and left, but stored her luggage at the hotel and shared her experience on the return route; third, after the woman involved called the police, the police also confirmed that they were not responsible for the matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the entire incident, it can be seen that the woman involved completely ignored the agreement between the &quot;travel partners&quot; and acted arbitrarily in the AA-style escort group, and always asked others to &quot;help her&quot; in the process. &quot;Leave her alone&quot;, claiming that it is not your prerogative. The most critical thing is that she failed to fulfill the punctual obligation of &quot;meeting at 16:30&quot; that the group had repeatedly confirmed, and she couldn&#39;t be contacted in the middle of the trip, so the other partners had no choice but to leave early. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be fair, after all, travel groups are very different from travel agency group tours. It is completely possible to &quot;discuss everything&quot; on specific matters, as long as it wins the consent of the majority of people or does not hinder other members rights and interests. Taking this incident as an example, the woman involved could have disagreed with the meeting time in advance and tried to persuade others to postpone the meeting. Of course, the woman involved could also offer to give others a certain amount of financial compensation and wait until she came back before setting off; that was really not possible. , you can also declare to &quot;leave the group&quot; without interfering with each other, eliminating the need for subsequent disputes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, problems similar to &quot;tourists not arriving at the meeting point at the specified time&quot; will also occur in group tours of travel agencies, which has also caused many disputes. Whenever a similar situation occurs, there are always two directions. The first is that &quot;a group of people are waiting for one person&quot; but they dare not speak out and allow tourists who do not abide by the contract to damage the rights and interests of others; the second is that the travel agency &quot;does not tolerate him&quot; after seeking the consent of the tourists present and gathers them to leave first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2023, during a dispute over the &quot;One-day trip to Beijing Olympic Park&quot; involving a tour group from Tianjin, the tour guide asked to gather at 15:00, but tourist Song and four other people did not arrive until 15:30 because of their children. At the meeting point, the tour guide car has left at this time, and tourists have to return to Tianjin on their own. Song and others requested the travel agency to refund a total of 8,490 yuan including all travel expenses, liquidated damages, self-return expenses, and mental damages. After the trial, the court held that Song and others had breached the contract and the travel agency had no liability for compensation, and dismissed the plaintiff&#39;s lawsuit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If travel agencies have obligations to abide by contracts and need to bear liability for breach of contract, then the same is true for tourists. Put it in the scenario of &quot;travel hook-ups&quot;, that is, every hook-up has an obligation to keep the contract, and they also need to bear the same liability for breach of contract. Of course, partners can also reach different proportions of rights and obligations distribution plans, and women can also receive some care, such as &quot;help her and let her&quot; in this incident, but this does not mean that the woman involved can Regardless of breach of contract, unless she really treats other partners as personal tour guides. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Details of this case show that the five-person group that set off this time did not reach any form of written contract, so there is no way to talk about their respective rights and obligations stipulated in black and white. The travel agreement between the group members was reached in the form of a verbal contract, and the only written form was nothing more than &quot;WeChat group chat records.&quot; After the woman in question withdrew from the group, the chat records became incomplete, which once affected the determination of facts and gave the woman in question room to gain a head start and &quot;preemptively draw pictures&quot; on social media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, although &quot;travel partners&quot; are much more flexible than travel agency group tours, they still have to abide by the contract reached between each other so that the entire team can successfully complete the journey. &quot;Travel partner&quot; can be regarded as a tiny autonomous group. The success of the journey depends on the contractual spirit, organizational ability, communication and coordination ability of each team member. To put it bluntly, it is how to adjust the relationship between &quot;individual&quot; and &quot;team&quot; The relationship of rights and obligations between each other, so that each partner has &quot;equal rights and responsibilities&quot; in the itinerary, only in this way can the situation of everyone be improved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the standard contracts and team formats of travel agencies and group tours, the travel format of &quot;travel partners&quot; is full of more flexibility and uncertainty, which also tests the comprehensive skills of team members. Qualities include but are not limited to physical fitness, interpersonal skills, self-rescue ability, adaptability, etc. This case also shows that in addition to safety issues, contract issues have arisen in the emerging business of travel hookups. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Freedom is not free, it also means responsibility. Even if it is a &quot;go as you please&quot; and &quot;flexible&quot; travel group, this kind of freedom does not mean that you can do whatever you want, and it cannot evolve into the behavior of letting others foot the bill at any time. Since the tour group has delegated the freedom of travel to each partner, it also requires each partner to fulfill their own responsibilities, abide by the contracts reached with other partners, and be responsible for their own choices at any time and bear the costs. , you can enjoy the joy of traveling with strangers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 05 Nov 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[成都地铁被疑偷拍案开庭，涉事女子“差一个道歉”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260000]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-05 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;He Jun described the incident on Weibo, with diagrams of each scene .

The person involved, He Jun (pseudonym), wrote in a long post on Weibo that he was secretly photographed on the subway by a small camera hidden in his shoes. He was then carried to the platform by a subway security guard and stood with one foot off his shoes and socks. span>;&lt;span>;The crowd&lt;/span>; watches. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He Jun believes that this process is like a shadow in life. For this reason, he went through many twists and turns and brought the two women involved and the Chengdu Metro to the court, demanding a public apology and financial compensation. The incident occurred a week after a Sichuan University girl falsely accused migrant workers of secretly filming her, and thus attracted much attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Nearly half a year after the incident, on November 3, 2023, He Jun sued two women for a general personality rights dispute in the Chengdu Railway Transportation First Court. . The trial lasted for two and a half hours that day, and no verdict was announced in court. He Jun said on Weibo that when he recalled the entire process during the trial, he still felt very uncomfortable and had to constantly restrain his emotions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Dan, He Jun’s attorney, mentioned, “Leave aside the issue of men and women, any person can defend themselves when their rights and interests are threatened. own rights.&quot; Liu Dan said that he understood the behavior of the woman involved in standing up bravely when she suspected that she was being secretly photographed; but with such rights, she should also bear corresponding obligations. After discovering that it was a misunderstanding, the woman involved&lt;span >;The child&lt;/span>; should apologize proactively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/83324ca659.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/83324ca659.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257124&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;He Jun described the incident on Weibo, accompanied by diagrams of each scene. Internet screenshots&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Unacceptable apology&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He Jun has told the story of the incident many times on different occasions. For the first time, He Jun wrote a long article on Weibo based on his own memories, and always kept this article at the top of Weibo. After the case entered the investigation and evidence collection stage, He Jun made additional corrections to some details based on the contents of surveillance videos and law enforcement recorders, and gradually updated them on Weibo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On June 11, 2023, He &lt;span>;Jun&lt;/span>; took the subway home from Xipu, Chengdu. When he arrived at the South Railway Station, there was Two girls said they saw the green light flashing on his shoes and suspected that he was filming secretly. According to the video provided by passengers in the same carriage, two girls pointed at his shoes and said, &quot;It&#39;s shining, it&#39;s not reflecting light, it&#39;s shining.&quot; &quot;When we were filming, he put it on closed&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the train safety officer of the car arrived, He Jun took off his shoes in public according to the girl&#39;s request. After the train safety officer and the two girls checked, no camera was found. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He Jun recalled to Southern Weekend reporters before the court session that during this process, everyone on the train suddenly focused their attention on him, and some people deliberately looked out. When he looked up, he saw someone was taking pictures with a mobile phone, which already made him feel uncomfortable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another place that made him feel uncomfortable was when he arrived at the station. The security officer and the station attendant arranged for him to stand against the wall and take off his right shoe. He Jun said that the environment he was in at that time was a public place connected to the platform. Passengers coming and going could see him taking off his right shoe and socks and standing next to the wall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;I think this matter is not final. I was just a suspect at the time, so we should consider reducing some of the impact, such as taking me to a In a place with few people, maybe use something to block me, that’s what I thought.” He Jun believed that this was something Chengdu Metro did improperly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Dan, He Jun&#39;s attorney, told Southern Weekend reporters that they added Chengdu Metro as a defendant precisely because Chengdu Metro had problems with expanding the damage. It is true that the subway security officer did not force He Jun to take off his shoes or search him, but after a preliminary check that he was not secretly photographed, he could consider finding an office where the two parties could sit down and negotiate and wait for the police to arrive. Liu Dan said that in the case, He Jun also took the initiative to call the police. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the police took off He Jun&#39;s shoes for inspection, they confirmed that there was no camera. The police also showed a restored video taken at the same location on the subway, and speculated that the advertising plates on both sides were reflected on the shiny surface of the shoes, reflecting green light. After mediation by the police, the two &lt;span>;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;girls&lt;/span>; apologized to He Jun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He Jun is not satisfied with this apology. He said that according to the video content of the law enforcement recorder reviewed afterwards, the older female student said &quot;I&#39;m sorry, handsome man&quot;, and the younger female student said immediately &quot;We I have wronged you.&quot; &quot;The entire sentence did not take more than two seconds,&quot; He Jun said. They were &lt;span>;wearing&lt;/span>; masks and could not hear clearly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the long article recorded by He Jun afterwards, the police mediation was still continuing, and the girl &lt;span>;&lt;/span>; emphasized that she was speaking for the public. , to prevent other people&#39;s privacy from being infringed, and He Jun emphasized that the two &lt;span>;girls&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;girls&lt;/span>; had a &quot;meal-eating&quot; mentality to share their experiences with their friends. &lt;p>; &quot;After they apologized, I think they may have made up their minds (to defend their rights),&quot; He Jun said. The next day, he took the initiative to post the experience online with the subject &quot;I was falsely accused of being secretly filmed by wearing a shoe-covered camera on the Chengdu subway.&quot; &quot;, hoping to record the progress of his rights protection, and also hope to find &lt;span>;eyewitnesses&lt;/span>; in the same carriage through the Internet. The post quickly attracted attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;He Junfa&#39;s diagram on Weibo.

At first, He Jun could not find any evidence such as video of the scene to prove the place of occurrence, which made it impossible to file a case in court for investigation and evidence collection. After many twists and turns, a man in the same carriage provided a signed certificate stating that the incident had occurred on Chengdu Metro Line 1, and the case was officially filed on August 15. During subsequent evidence collection, Chengdu Metro informed the platform that the monitoring equipment was damaged and the video was missing. On September 27, after communicating with his lawyer, He Jun added Chengdu Metro as a defendant in the prosecution case. The main reason was that Chengdu Metro was suspected of breach of contract and infringement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although some netizens demanded &quot;severe punishment&quot;, He Jun has not disclosed the two &lt;span>;names&lt;/span online in the six months since he posted this experience >;&lt;span>;Girls&lt;/span>; appearance, name and other private information. He does not support the method of &quot;responding to violence with violence.&quot; &quot;I have never had such an idea, and I have been calling on the media and netizens not to (defame or bully the other party online).&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Ding Yaqing, a lawyer at Guangdong Zhiheng (Guangzhou) Law Firm, has represented cases involving sexual harassment liability disputes. She believes that the two women involved suspected that someone was filming secretly and found the subway security officer to intervene in the verification. There was no problem in itself. In some situations where sexual harassment is alleged, finding a third party to intervene can help resolve the dispute. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The key is that after the facts were clarified, this man spent time and energy to cooperate with the investigation and was scrutinized in public. &quot;He felt bad.&quot; Therefore, it is necessary and reasonable to demand an apology and explanation. &quot;The core problem for the girls in this case is that the process of &lt;span>; and &lt;/span>; apologizing was not explained in the end.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the other hand, Ding Yaqing believes that Chengdu The train safety officers of the subway do not have the power to enforce the law, and their actions may not be appropriate in this regard. &quot;I noticed that the person involved said that the security officer carried him away,&quot; Ding Yaqing said. This &lt;span>;suggested&lt;/span>; whether the security officer exceeded his authority to conduct a search. She suggested that in places such as subways where sexual harassment accusations are prone to occur, staff should be trained, such as how to respond when such accusations occur, what are the staff&#39;s scope of authority, how to appease both parties, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;She believes that the response to sexual harassment accusations in public places can be compared to passengers encountering theft on the subway or bus - find a third party, The police, who have law enforcement powers, do not need to raise the issue of differences between men and women and gender antagonism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Ding Yaqing analyzed that in general personality rights infringement cases, the responsibilities stipulated by law include stopping the infringement, eliminating the impact, making an apology, etc. He Jun&#39;s current demands One is to publicly apologize, but whether the scope of disclosure refers to the place where the incident occurred or on social media such as Weibo, and to whom it is disclosed depends on the court hearing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Dan said that since the case is not open to trial, the form of a public apology cannot be disclosed. &quot;But it must be public, because the infringement is also public, and the apology It should also be made public.&quot; After the court hearing that day, Liu Dan said in an interview that there was a fierce debate in the court and the other party also provided tenable arguments.

He cannot accept unknown creatures and always looks at other creatures from a superior perspective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Ursula was shocked by the beauty of the living and dying plant villain, Sam was very angry, feeling that Ursula had deviated from the mission and was irrational. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/04/dfee3c0c682bd74543d15335b9c3bf68.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;604&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/04/dfee3c0c682bd74543d15335b9c3bf68.png&quot; data-key=&quot;257062&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So in this On the planet, Sam seemed out of place. Ursula, on the other hand, seems to be gradually mastering the rhythm of the planet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She put aside her own prejudices and tried to let perception take precedence, getting to know the planet step by step and discovering its beauty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same goes for Archie in the second line. At first, she had no feelings for Levi, only command and control. But gradually, she realized the changes in Levi, and felt the pulse of the planet through Levi&#39;s guidance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here, artificial intelligence has actually completed the connection with living things earlier than humans, thus guiding humans to return to a state of childlike curiosity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/04/c6c5af4e6002655305e8d88c27af2919.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/04/c6c5af4e6002655305e8d88c27af2919.png&quot; data-key=&quot;257063&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 3 The Carmen in this line is different from the first two lines. He reaches a connection with the alien creature Xiao Hei in a way that loses his humanity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, Carmen&#39;s use of tools as a human made Xiao Hei quickly become the king of the species. On the other hand, Carmen&#39;s obsession with illusions makes Xiao Hei lose the ability to distinguish the truth in the process of using tools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/04/e3f3cac002d9d9fc55b4940a90d67aa0.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/04/e3f3cac002d9d9fc55b4940a90d67aa0.png&quot; data-key=&quot;257064&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here, Man has become a captive and a tool, in a lower position, while the little black who enslaved him has reached the top of the food chain. But on the other hand, perhaps in the eyes of other creatures, human beings are like that scary fat little black insect, with endless greed and desire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/04/d9cfcf79dc8b1b7d90b4dc9fb25431b7.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/04/d9cfcf79dc8b1b7d90b4dc9fb25431b7.png&quot; data-key=&quot;257061&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This drama Although it is a science fiction work, it uses the method of weakening the plot and enlarging the picture to break the anthropocentric thinking path, trying to bring the audience into an almost wild and equal environment, and use imagination to awaken human beings to The awe of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here, the power of technology is hidden, but a kind of primitive vitality is filled with it. Here, no creature is superior to other creatures, and there is no large-scale plundering or killing. Everything is slow and orderly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, don’t talk, don’t think, feel first, is the most correct way to open this animation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 05 Nov 2023 15:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[周涛　宿命狷狂]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259996]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-05 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/05/98756b2c861e592ad4dfd9368f93a90b.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;984&quot; height=&quot;656&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/98756b2c861e592ad4dfd9368f93a90 b. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257100&quot; data-mce-width=&quot;0&quot; data-mce-height=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>; &lt;span>;Zhou Tao&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Picture/Liu Xin&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Whether it is in the oral autobiography &quot;A Man and Xinjiang&quot; or the novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, Zhou Tao regarded himself as a specimen in that period of history.

He originally named it &quot;The Beginning of Chaos&quot; to refer to the confusion of young people during the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; who could not see the way forward. One day before the publication of &quot;Contemporary&quot;, he suddenly realized that when he and his companions were sent to a remote place, they were on the way to the west: and &quot;the west is the place where the sun sets, the place where snow accumulates, and the way to the west.&quot; It is a road with dusk clouds hanging low like a curtain, and people&#39;s hearts are always curled up in their chests.

His ability, eyesight and life are all dependent on his wife. It is difficult for readers who know a little about the author to think: &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Is this Zhou Tao himself? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Literary critic and editor-in-chief of &quot;People&#39;s Liberation Army Literature and Art&quot; Yin Shi saw the manuscript for the first time and was shocked. It was so direct! &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“There was a lot of scar literature in the 1980s that exposed the problems of the era. Most of them were complaints from victims. When writing about a character or event, there seemed to be hidden dissatisfaction and slightness. The protest carries a very subtle criticism, but it is not clear and does not describe specific political life, political tasks, or political beliefs. When writing about the so-called villain, do not go deep into his heart. It&#39;s just a symbol.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Yin Shi pointed out that in &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, Qu Ming, who went to Yan&#39;an to study Lu Yi as a teenager and received a red education, was in the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;期间变成了投机者和程墙背后的谋士，寄望于另一场“革命”的成功和新的利益分配——这正是姬书藤逐渐摆脱屈铭影响的主要原因。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;周涛还写到了农民出身的“造反派”程墙内心的想法，他对上层政治走势的判断，以及——他壮烈的、忠于内心信仰的自杀方式。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;姬书藤不喜欢程墙，但当程墙成了囚犯，他却一点儿也高兴不起来，程墙近乎于勇的跳崖自尽，更是让他惊心。 “他见不得别人落难，就像他不能容忍任何人飞扬跋扈……热爱自由，崇尚平等，姬书藤也是逐渐看到了自己天性中的另一面。一个人或一些人欺负、凌辱另一个人或一些人，并不是什么稀松平常的事，这是那种非常恐怖的行为；这种事一旦开了头，迫害、虐待、杀戮和毁灭就会随之而来。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;在喀什的8年里，屈铭和程墙在为人处世上塑造了姬书藤，最终被他超越，然而姬书藤并未因此逃脱更为可怕的精神恐怖与心灵磨难。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;因为在闲聊中讲了对领导的内心看法被人举报，姬书藤开始写检查，人立刻像个泄了气的皮球。他在检查里写，自己一定要“脱胎换骨”云云，不想竟真的如蛇一样蜕起皮来。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;“不疼，一点都不疼，你就放心揭它，没事！”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（妻子）庄延揭下来一块，放在旁边让他看。又揭下来一大块，“哎哟，好大的一块！”他偏过脸去一看，有半张小报那么大一块，白纸一张，质地坚韧，便说“别扔了，还不如在上面直接写检查呢。人皮检查，比稿纸上的更深刻！”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;——《西行记》&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;为了迎接历史的畸变，人甚至可以自我非人化，迎合着自然力一样的暴行。殷实因而认为，尽管写作技法、人物塑造上有缺陷，但毫不掩饰地暴露心迹和展现干部子弟的沉浮轨迹与思想，使《西行记》具有了“人性科学调查报告”的价值。 “对于像周涛这样的准&#39;官二代&#39;，精神自传和文献价值是第一步，自省，则属于进一步的要求。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/7dc37dba640ff1da5d7f0082e3868018.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;564&quot; height=&quot;824&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/7dc37dba640ff1da5d7f0082e3868018.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;这样的个体，与中国传统中的君子儒士无疑拉开很远。似乎，那些不得不保全的、不得不在意的面具，他决意在古稀之年来临前，一把撕掉。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/f37d4fae1864a9506df6526b7ff2e059.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;“为什么这么寡情？答曰：这儿本来就不是我的地方。”他认为，一个人，18岁以前生长在什么地方，那地方就会成为他永远的故乡。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;9岁以前，周涛生活在北京。在伊犁接受再教育和下放到喀什前，他都跟随父母生活在乌鲁木齐——在他眼中显然“高”出南疆。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;优越感与生俱来。首先便是长相。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;从小他生得肤白眼大，放在有外国小孩儿的娃娃堆里，也是最吸睛的那个。周家全家人皮肤都白。他曾经问姨妈，爷爷什么样？姨说，“你爷爷你们都比不了，长得排场。”周涛觉得自家血统应该是混血，因为老家山西榆社就是一个人种混杂地区，“匈奴、羌、羯氐聚集。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;比他年轻近10岁的军旅作家小乔说，周涛天生一副“让人怀疑上帝偏心的面孔和身段。再加上幽默狡猾反应极快且词锋犀利，这种人很容易让人产生嫉妒之心的同时又产生交好的愿望”。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;皮囊在外，家世才是根底。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;周涛父亲周文杰早年参加山西抗日青年决死队&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;当时的党外团体，其实是共产党领导的抗日团体，后来变成正规军&lt;/span>;）&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;，从事群众工作，担任文化教员，后来成为陈赓的部下。开国大典时，正营级干部周文杰站在天安门城楼下第一排，再往后考上了军队里的外交官，分在外国语学院。 “文革”前是十四级干部。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;周涛的小学同学里有不少高级干部的子女。优越感无形中就注入了童年周涛的头脑。他记得弟弟出生时，中午医院给他母亲做蛋炒饭，她不吃，给4岁的周涛吃。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;也是4岁那年，周涛站在海淀区的一个小山坡上，正好是早上上班时间。他觉得自己好像大将军一样，“看着脚下灰蓝黑的人流，心里忽然间生起优越感。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;这个念头周涛一生都记得，越大越觉得奇怪：“那么小的时候怎么会产生这种念头呢？”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;那念头是他一生当中思想基础所发出的芽儿。芽长出来，也和他一生联系在一起。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;他的同学赵南有一次看到街上要饭的，说咱们有一天沦落到这个地步怎么办？周涛答：“即便沦落到这个地步，我们站着，别人一看也不一样。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“很多革命子弟都有那种优越感，其实相对这几十年的历史来说，都是很肤浅的东西。&#39;天下&#39;这种观念，也是很腐朽的了。”殷实说。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;周涛未尝意识不到。他在《西行记》里写过姬书藤所在阶层的自傲与顽固：&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;有个小家伙才小学三年级，就可以历数十大元帅、十个大将、六十几位上将的姓名、职务、军衔。人奇之，问道：“那你长大能当什么将？”答曰：“至少上将。”长到十六七岁，愈加高俊不凡，体育文艺，多有天赋，似乎父辈的革命生涯真有什么血脉遗传。但是之后到了社会上，大部分不能适应。 ……至于中国革命的精神遗产：追求社会平等，崇尚利他主义的新文化，到了他们那儿更是全然不见了踪影。毫无疑问，姬书藤自己就是这类人中的一员，他很清楚，自己是“被严格筛选过的食品喂大的”，他也确信：“正是这样，我们这一代人正是这样满怀信心地像一块石头一样地长大了，水泼不进，针扎不透，任何别的事物都很难再渗入我们的头脑。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;在这样一群眼界高的顽主里，周涛的桀骜不驯更加突出。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;有父亲的回忆为证：“涛十四五岁特爱骑马，特爱骑脚踏车。一次，随党校干部到南山玩，独自骑上哈萨克的马在山路上猛跑，目睹者惊骇，经领导急喊大骂，始罢。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;他身体素质好，曾经获得全疆大学生男乒单打冠军。但初中时去北京集训一年，就不愿意干了，故意把球踩烂，把拍子摔在墙上。 “主教练让我改了横板以后我特别别扭，因为我这个人的性格是进攻型不是防守型的，让我打防守就不愿意了。不愿意了就破坏，不干了。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;恃才放旷、年少轻狂里，也有异乎同龄人的审时度势。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;十四五岁，他已经明白，打乒乓球，成不了事。不在于身体条件和头脑，而是起步太晚。 “如果我要在北京，我绝对打进国家队，条件足够了。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;还有一件事，他更不在话下。中学语文老师吴国梅给周涛作文打95分，给了他巨大的鼓励。别的同学都把札记作业当成苦差事，只有他在札记里找到了乐趣。 “为什么后来我一写散文就拿下？因为老早就写过，十本札记就是散文。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;文学，是天分，也是周涛上升通道里最清晰的那条。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/73a2271d659b7a2e6a6d7fc959a3ccde.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;到了那儿发现，一夜之间变成“囚”了：不许离开连队25米，出去要报告，每天实行严格的军事管理。 “拉粮食的看见说，你们哪像大学生，跟劳改犯有什么区别？男女不分，一个个破破烂烂的鬼样子。马圈里面铺了稻草，半夜老鼠在头上跑，把有的人半个耳朵咬掉了。”蛮横无情的指导员，不让生病的学生看病。周涛说那时最大的心愿就是“把指导员抓起来扔到巩乃斯河里”。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;我们把草原耕到什么程度？ （用手比划）这是个毡房，毡房周围全部耕了，耕地离毡房也就五米远。 “白毡房成了仅存于翻耕土地间的一个孤岛。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;毡房里的狗狂吠，出来一个老太婆，一句话没说，冷冷地看着我们的拖拉机，“那不是愤怒，是藐视。那一眼，凝聚了七十多个冬天的寒冷，一眼就把我们的灵魂看成了碎片。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;现在你看我肚子够大吧，那时我的肚子就像挖地机挖出的大坑，全凹下去。瘦到64公斤，脸上棱骨都出来了。八十多公斤两袋的麦子，人家两个人抓着袋角，一提，你往下一钻，搭到背上吧。我那时候怎么干的？我一个人把那两个袋子提起来以后，直接架肩上，瘦骨嶙峋，力大无穷（笑）。能够这样的人没几个。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;粮仓上面有个三角顶，要把一个钢筋从顶上打下去，两面上螺丝固定。有个胆大的在上头抡榔头，我在下头扶着，有一回榔头差点砸到脑袋。还有一回我从空中跳下去抓住那个绳子，结果抓住以后，绳子是盘着的，好长一段没绑，要是那头也没绑，那就非得死了，没死也非得残废。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;荷尔蒙爆棚的年纪，陡然间从天上掉入泥坑。他开始琢磨出身与命运之间的关系。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“人和人没有太大的差别，除非特别笨的人和特别聪明的人，大部分人都是一样的。人的差别都是社会造成的。我当时有一句话——如果平等，你们敢吗？如果在同一个起跑线上，我们怕谁？但那时你处处受压制，处处都碰壁，啥事也办不成。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;这种琢磨和玩味，从此伴随一生。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/a9168589bca8721555e60a9bdea74826.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;984&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;周涛一直慨叹，伊犁与喀什的10年，是自己人生最颓顿的岁月。近五十年后回首，他依然对父亲的“糊涂”报以嗤笑和不太理解。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;1941、1942年的时候，父亲得了病，在驻军医院里成了日本人的俘虏。被吊起来拷打，他始终没有暴露他的军人身份。有一个汉奸先进来，他当时给汉奸写了一个条子，说你也是中国人，咱们都是中国人。我父亲的意思是让他帮忙。到了“文革”他被打成叛徒。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;我父亲属于小地主家庭的思维方式，还有点理想主义的东西，和现实距离太远，不太会接人待物，对啥人都热情，不适应中国文化。马文到我们家稍微一接触，她就说你爸的思维怎么像外国人？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;他是很厚道很正直的人，但他不是一个社会能力强的人。他这一辈子走下坡路，是坐滑梯的人。他不是不想跟，他太想跟了，但是他跟不上。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;1970年，已经开除党籍的周文杰被下放到昌吉吉木萨尔县国庆公社当农民，母亲也跟随父亲去了农村。两年后，老大周涛从伊犁农场再教育结束，确定分配到喀什以后，先带着妻子到吉木萨尔探家。他的散文名篇《吉木萨尔纪事》就是写的那次经历。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/d5fb99b945f2f7fbfac26d3fa269ca63.jpeg&quot;

data-mce-height=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;在村口，周涛抽根烟歇一会儿，打算过一会儿问问路。一个穿着黑棉袄的老汉拿着粪筐，老往他身边绕。周涛心想他看啥呢，还笑着。再仔细看看，这不是我爹吗？ &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;老爷子已经完全成农村老汉了，一个是穿着打扮农村化，一个是精神状态农村化，整个把他改造成农民了。我妈在门口站着等。她看着很可怜，头发花白，被风吹着。去的时候头发还没白，才五十多岁就已经老得很。他们觉得没有可能回来了，一辈子就成这样了。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;……&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;看着眼前的这个提筐子的人，我就想起少年时在机关院里与ー群顽童舞枪弄棍鏖战正酣时，突然出现在楼前怒喝我为“疯狗”的人；想起星期天逼我帮他冲洗全家无穷无尽的衣物，水寒刺骨，手冻通红，而他不把最后一点肥皂沫冲净决不善罢甘休；还想起那个原先穿军官制服尔后穿中山装干部服最后又穿上农民黑棉袄的人；而且想起曾经风采翩翩然后神态庄重终于苍老迷惘成现在这个样子的父亲。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;在散文里，他自责，自己总是由于父亲在现实中的失败而低估他，忽视了他作为一个人在本质上具有的优秀品质。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;吊诡的是，从说话的声音到走路的姿势，从身材和五官，到习性和灵魂，无论社会环境有利还是不利，他始终摆脱不了父亲注入自己体内的遗传基因。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;后来他领悟到：如果没有父亲这种结局的突兀出现，他很可能会沿着一个五陵公子的生活轨迹延续下去，直到有一天突然发现自己已经被社会的变迁远远甩在车厢后面。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;性情也就此有了收敛。 “他倒霉以后我就比较低调。心里有鬼，有软肋，老实多了，不敢再张扬了。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;在那个年代，文学是兴趣，也是为自己和家庭谋求出路的门径。婚姻，异曲同工。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;妻子马文的父亲当时是南疆军区政委、少将。在《一个人和新疆》里，周涛坦承，自己的婚姻是明显的机会主义行为，为此抛弃了那时的爱人，“终生内疚”。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;马文家本不同意接纳当时潦倒落魄的周涛，但马文一门心思和周涛好，跟父亲明确说，“如果你不让我跟他好也行，我听你的，但我一辈子不会结婚。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;结完婚不到十天，周涛便和马文一块去了伊犁农场。一回头，已是半个世纪。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/fcbe7b129290d54f13e3d7743edf0137.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;坐在乌市部队小区敞亮的小院儿里，周涛对妻子的好如数家珍。 “她可能干了。家里里里外外都是她打理。你别看她眼睛不好，什么都明白。我这院儿里种的树，她全给我砍了，换了海棠、石榴、枣、杏、桃子、样样长得溜。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;周涛虽狂，却明白自己的短处。他外向张扬，但碰到突如其来的挫折，反而容易乱了方寸。妻子却不然，永远沉得住气。 “我会看自己，不大会看别人。马文善于识人，好人坏人，她看得很明白。办事能力在女人里面是出类拔萃的。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;马文对名利也看得开。周涛说自己退休进北京是够条件的，军队可以给他安排房子。 “马老太不去，她说她自己在新疆待着。她这个人有定力，不容易为虚荣左右。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;然而自传出版后，一位部队女作家按捺不住愤怒，撰文批评周涛放弃爱情，选择“最合适”&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;最安全、不惹麻烦&lt;/span>;）&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;的女性成为伴侣，用“中国男人传统的&#39;丑妻薄地热炕头&#39;”那一套来作说辞，最终对两位女性的总结以及功利性评判，又等于否定了自己的罪疚感。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;对此，周涛没有给予任何回应。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“自传里的描述，你有给马文老师看吗？”我问他。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“没。”周涛笑笑。笑容里既有“她就算看到，也顶多一笑置之”的了解，也有那么一丝丝的忌惮。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 data-css=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;color: inherit;margin: 0px;padding: 5px 15px 0px&quot;>;&lt;span data-css=&quot;box-sizing:border-box;color:inherit;font-size:18px;margin:0px;padding:0px&quot;>;&lt;strong>;40岁之后，不再写诗&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;时运在上世纪70年代末降临在“怀才不遇”的周涛身上。依靠自己的文学才能和父亲的关系，他成功地调入乌鲁木齐的军区创作室，专心以文为生。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;1978年8月，作家曹禺和徐迟去新疆时，读到周涛的诗作《天山南北》之后，在座谈会上赞扬“有情有味，是真正的诗”。周涛被这大好消息弄得猝不及防，想起引发自己文学梦的昔日“神童作家”刘绍棠，“上高中老师在讲台上讲他的《大青骡子》，他&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;（刘绍棠）&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;和同学一起坐在课堂里听讲。那该是一种什么感觉！”自己而立之年碰上高人赏识，心中涌起欢喜。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;那之后的两三年成了周涛诗歌的爆发期。小乔记得，1981年的几乎每一两天，周涛就会有一首新诗的岩浆喷涌出地面。 “看看它们的日期，密集得如诗人每天出门时留下的足迹！”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;周涛曾经和杨牧、章德益合计，打造“新边塞诗”，不是写征战，而是反映新疆地区的独特风貌。一时间，他们的名字接连占据了《诗刊》、《人民文学》、《上海文学》的版面，处在文学潮的风头浪尖。新疆文联主席刘肖无对此表示反对，理由是“边塞诗原来是征战西北的，现在新疆是祖国的一部分，你征战谁去？”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;待朦胧诗起来以后，周涛曾给自己定向——“郭小川的声音、闻捷的色彩”，却发现这样的结合“不太好使”。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/0e32231c9649e4b49505957342ee2a0b.jpeg&quot;

data-mce-height=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;1984年，三位军队作家在昆明机场，准备乘直升机飞赴老山。从左往右依次为李斌奎、周涛、李彦清&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;1984年，他和另外两位作家一道受命去老山前线创作。一开始，他还拿上山的路险“添油加醋”说给没上山的作家听，吓唬人家；到后来，他亲眼目睹战士被越军地雷炸瞎了眼。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;习惯了，晚上战士们都睡得着。 “一个个钢盔在枕头边撂着，一个个面孔睡得像雕塑一样，一个个都是从死神手里逃出来的人。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;天天和战士们同吃同睡，混熟了，周涛从他们嘴里没听到任何豪言壮语。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;问打仗感觉咋样？战士说，“敌人炮弹覆盖的时候太可怕了，恨不得钻到地底下去，赶快爬不说，也顾不上姿势了。没法表述那个恐怖，那是人的意志绝对无法抗拒的，能躲过去就不错了。”周涛想象，我方的炮火覆盖对方的时候也是一样的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;他写下了2000行的长诗《山岳山岳，丛林丛林》。诗里不光有战争的残酷，也有超越胜负与因果的书写角度：&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;我的可怜而固执的邻居&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;我的心其实是愤怒而又疼痛&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;几乎是一边在打一边在哭&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;这首长诗只在两家不太著名的边疆刊物上发表过，单行本又因出版社方面拆版未能问世，没有进入更多读者的视野。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“有点遗憾。被莫名其妙地忽略了。如果这首诗能在《人民文学》这样的刊物全文刊出，影响会很大的。”殷实等多位评论家和好友为周涛抱不平。作者自己倒是想开了，“写得太容易，很随便。只是在本子上开始写着玩，后来越写越长，一字没改，别人都不相信。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;周涛说过，他惟一的敌人就是自己。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;写诗写得兴高采烈，但他对自己的要求是：我的诗，达到全国&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;（顶尖）&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;水平，就不写了。果不其然，他40岁生日那天得了全国奖，他便觉得，自己的诗歌生涯也到了头。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;下一个要攻的山头？散文吧。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;周涛认为自己的贡献和独到在于“解放散文”：散文的写作“重要的不是化验和肢解，而是感受和拥抱”，他不喜欢“研究”，更愿意漫无边际地遐想、悠思、品味，所以他不在乎开头的突兀，不关心上下段的过渡和照应，而是以诗的逻辑、结构和笔法去写散文。他甚至口出狂言，“散文没有章法。我就是章法。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;于是在周涛的文字里，种种记忆、思想、情感和想象奔涌交汇，如越过堤岸的河水，在无际的草地上四处蔓延。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;他反感“游山玩水”的说法，认为那只是“把山和水当作精神意义上的妓女罢了”。在名作《巩乃斯的马》里，他把观赏马的气韵、筋骨当成艺术享受；在《猛禽》里，他聚焦一只与老狼搏斗、利爪分别深陷于老狼骨缝和树干最后被奔跑的狼撕裂的鹰；在《过河》里，惊叹年逾八旬的瘦弱的哈萨克族老太太竟制服了不肯过河的烈马……&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;无论是神山或者野马，或是人，在周涛激昂豪放的表达中，总会浮现出强烈的“夫子自况”色彩，自认强大并与强者引为同类的惺惺相惜。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/869c4630e5db9b2e0e06a7b6a78217b2.jpeg&quot;

data-mce-height=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;他的散文以篇幅长&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;好几篇都在两万字以上&lt;/span>;）&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;、强烈的表达和思辨冲动著称。周涛对此也曾有过冷静的认识：“思辨是散文里的一种成分，过分了，会伤害艺术，所以我特别看重贾平凹的散文，他恰恰不重思辨而撷取生活中暗含的底蕴，他更重对生活原始形态的直接感光。对他的认可，实际上表现我对自己某些缺陷的认可。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;虽然二十多年前已有上述认识，但自那之后，他急切言说思想的习惯，至今未改。 《西行记》里依然可见一斑。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;周涛的身上聚集着天之骄子的自得与时代笼罩在头上、害怕“丧失既得”的恐惧；他迷恋文学，以为它自由、公平，不像政治那样复杂。 20年前，以散文集首获鲁迅文学奖，他却没去领奖。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;原因？ “文学各种奖项和我心目中想象的距离太大。奖要公正，不能鱼目混珠，泥沙俱下，不能撒胡椒面，要奖给那些最值得奖励的人，不管那个人是谁，也许不是我。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;他说曾经的80年代，民族目标明确，人人充满希望，整个时代是《祝酒歌》所渲染的情绪。但90年代初，他无可避免地产生了虚无的情绪，游离于社会，不再那么直接。 《博尔塔拉冬天的惶惑》，便写于那样的状态之下——然而读懂的人，终是少数。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;二十多年后完成的《西行记》里，周涛写到姬书藤等干部下乡，享受了叶尔羌河畔胡杨林下一顿烤鱼盛宴：“古老的麦盖提人变戏法似的，从河里捕捞出活蹦乱跳的大鱼！……托盘呈上，那种滋味，真是香透脑片骨！”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;值得注意的绝不是美味，而在于美食供给者与享用者的姿态：&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;检查团的领导们盘腿坐在胡杨林间的空地上，地上铺着华丽的和田地毯。村民捧着托盘，俯首躬身，膝语蛇行，如侍帝王。这些伟大的礼仪是谁教给他们的？这种令人噙泪的文明是什么时候养成的？姬书藤忽然心生愧疚，觉得自己配不上这样的盛宴和虔诚的礼节，对不起这些在篝火边跳刀郎舞、在果园里画农民画的沙漠人。我们为人家做了什么值得人家这样隆重接待？ ” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;——《西行记》&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;这让我想起周涛80年代创作的长篇散文《哈拉沙尔随笔》。在那篇文章里，他从同行人干裂的嘴唇，联想到多半个世纪以前，马仲英的回族兵和霍加·尼牙孜的维吾尔人血战，而今，往事遗迹却被干渴的北方之唇&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;无水的山沟&lt;/span>;）&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;吃光了。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;他在生活在焉耆的这支回族人身上，看到一种并非人人都能感到的“百年孤独”：&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;隐忍、沉默的后面藏着可怕的强悍；怀疑、狡黠的不信任的目光后面有着最真诚的诺言和舍命相陪的友谊；屈辱的自卑感和深藏于心的强大自尊心的矛盾造成的痛苦；不被理解却又顽强地要保存自己所形成的隔阂；边远、贫困的落后生活方式与心比天高的自信力之间的大反差所导致的悲哀和固执心理，就造成了这种百年孤独。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;他提出，“中华民族的历史不仅仅是汉族的历史，历代帝王、名臣、保国有功的武将中就不知有多少是少数民族。 ”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;这样的着墨和观点，在他几十年的丰盛书写里，并不多见。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;和他有忘年之交的殷实犀利地指出他的问题：“他对新疆这片土地，对维吾尔族等少数民族表达得仍然不够。周涛在这点上也表达了一个汉人的精明。他没有从语言、从经典、从世俗文化，方方面面——他没有深入新疆。 ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;在刚刚写就的《西行记》分析里，殷实直言：“如果他们每一个人&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;（主角）&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;的内在世界，也都可以像姬书藤一样展开，特别是，如果对那个维吾尔族人物司马义·艾合买提江的个人精神世界、文化性格乃至民族属性，有深入挖掘和呈示的话，那么这部作品中的众声喧哗，包括不同&#39;声音&#39;之间的对话，将会构成多么巨大的张力。 ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;为何无法展开？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“语言障碍是一，不敢再真实下去是二。只能到此为止。 ”周涛回答我。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;他表达过对张承志的钦佩，却也坦言后者在信仰上走向了极致。事实上，周涛在大学的专业正是维吾尔语，但不到半年，高等教育之路便被伊犁“再教育”拦腰截断。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;而他表达懊恼叹惜的角度是：“假如学完了四年维语，到南疆哪个公社当书记，再当县一级干部，对民族关系、人事各个方面了解多一些、再进入历史的研究和民族的考察，就可能组织长篇小说。但那半年我没有多大兴趣学维语，看不到这么远。 ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;他在心理上很靠近哈萨克这样的草原民族，自比为“一个习惯了毡房和羊肉、热爱着草原和纵马的半游牧者”。而对生长于斯的新疆，他自认此地为故土，却也始终是以中原文化的根脉来观察和体验。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;在文学评论者韦器闳看来，周涛极少描写市井生活，也不以表现百姓的喜怒哀乐和审美趣味为己任，而是极力张扬自己个人化的人生体验。于是他的写作也呈现出一种“贵族化”的倾向。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/97d629aae0ecf1617113532ed8d97452.jpeg&quot;

data-mce-height=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;回顾这大半生，周涛说自己介乎文武之间：生在军队里是武，这是打的底色；读书上学是文；当运动员从武；回来读书上学喜欢文学又从文：从文以后最终又跑到兵营里从文了。“可以说文不成武不就，也可以说文武两道都在滋养你，也都在制约你；制约也是滋养。 ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;到老，他在部队文职干部中算最高级别，享受军级待遇。反而是操持了一辈子的母亲，听到儿子涛说，“妈，我快当将军了”，回了一句，“你一天仗也没打过，当什么将军？ ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“喀什的八年教会你什么呢？ ”我问他。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;他答：“不是你天生就怎么样，你那些个人的条件都必须在一个社会的大势之下才能得以施展和表现，否则一文不值。 ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“你是宿命论者？ ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;他点头。“人各有命，运是社会给你的可能性。有胆无识是&#39;二杆子&#39;，有识无胆是书呆子。有胆识，还有运，才可能成大事。我和马文？不是运，是命。 ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;在全家被政治运动分崩离析的年代里，他发出诘问：“从一个个由家庭中诞生出来的自在的少年，到成为被社会和自身条件嵌入某一职业的成人，命运啊，你将怎么打发我们？是对我们格外垂青呢还是特别冷漠？对后一种可能，我们当时是不愿意设想也不可能接受的。 ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;时光过去了50年，谜底完全揭开了。让他无限惊奇的是，今天的谜底，当初已经不断向他显示。他始终相信，那时候，一切都已注定。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;它改编自种田文《重生小地主》：现代姑娘连蔓儿乱入古代农村，成为了农家女子。她与神秘男子沈诺一起，与极品亲戚斗智斗勇，为懦弱“爹娘”讨回公道。在有限的条件下勤劳致富、苦心经营，收获种田事业的同时也收获了爱情。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《田耕纪》的热播秘诀只有两个字——种田。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/c7495f4ccca4d14862ab7149f37acf14.jpeg&quot;

data-key=&quot;256834&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在强调快节奏、强叙事的网文中，主打稳稳的幸福的种田文显得有些独树一帜。种田文的发展分为三个阶段。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;早期脱胎于SLG（策略类）游戏，主角和玩家一样在异世界招兵买马，完成任务，以“高筑墙，广积粮，缓称王”为宗旨，发展经济或农业，不断拓展自身势力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中期则聚焦于字面意思，让主角在封建社会发家致富，叙事风格流于温馨平和生活化。除了《田耕纪》&lt;span>;的原作《重生小地主》，《古代山居种田养娃之日常》《我在大宋卖火锅》等热门小说也隶属于这一时期的种田文范畴。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;后期种田文画风清&lt;/span>;奇，在“种田”的基础思维上融合无限流、奇幻、悬疑等因素，实现了类型的融合，如《重生成龙王后我靠海鲜发家》《我靠种田，在星际拯救人类》等等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果要在传统文学中给种田文找&lt;span>;个源头，那么最贴近的便是乡土文学。两者均把目光投向了乡野景观，但乡土文学的底色是厚重的，通常承载着苦难叙事，而种田文则是轻盈的、舒缓的真空式写作。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/49e2fb8f4e551fbc1fb45b218c4791fe.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;

&lt;p>;《花间提壶方大厨》和《&lt;span>;人间烟火花小厨》就属于比较成功的范例，没有快意恩仇，没有嗔痴怨念，仅围绕搞事业的女主角展开小切口叙事。这两部剧均弱化了农耕属性，放大美食元素，借助可口菜肴勾起观众的共情体验。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/79d11908058c277cff63481c61f129db.jpeg&quot;

data-key=&quot;256832&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;年度爆剧《知否知否应是绿肥红瘦》改编自关心则乱的同名种田文，讲述盛家庶女盛明兰利用聪明才智在大家族内生存并闯过人生层层考验的故事。剧版删去了原作里的穿越元素，让女主在等级森严、嫡庶有别的封建社会里依矩行事的逻辑更为自洽。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;《知否》在弱化农耕元素的同时，凸显宅斗与经营元素，增强戏剧冲突，围绕大娘子、林小娘、墨兰的嫡庶讨论一度超过了女主角盛明兰。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/be81d57344a5d940a288c87483302cdc.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;719&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/948462ff5883bf8134990b1f861c86f1.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot;

&lt;p>;女主角连蔓儿事业线（完成系统任务，赚足1000金）、爱情线（和沈诺从坚定盟友变知心爱人）、亲&lt;span>;情线（帮爹娘智斗无德亲戚）三手抓，争做每条赛道的赢家。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/49d75a2346f3bfa7c78e7bbd3db59117.jpeg&quot;

data-key=&quot;256835&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;只不过从观众反馈来看：爱情线太腻缺乏CP感，亲情线太气人影响观众情绪，大家最爱看的还是种田的事业线。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;毕竟，爱情故事在当代网剧里泛滥成灾，点击任意一部偶像剧就能收获帅哥美女在任何时代、任何行业里谈恋爱；气死人不偿命的极品亲戚们近年来在古装剧、都市剧也看得不少，难免有雷同之感。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;因此，《田耕纪》最终火于看似平平淡淡的种田线，而非其他也不难理解了。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;它不禁让人联想到今年上半年的一档现象级综艺《种地吧》，10个年轻嘉宾，用190天时间，在142亩土地上的播种与收获。可能连他们自己也没想到，居然会有那么多观众愿意看他们种地的事情。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/97ce23d7460c454ac135cfad19543d0e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot;

&lt;p>;对于国人而言，“种田天赋”是不需要&lt;span>;点亮就能获得的初始技能。几千年来，中国社会占主导的便是农耕文明，它凝聚了劳动人民的智慧结晶，孕育出博大精深的中华文化。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;陶渊明笔下“采菊东篱下，悠然见南山”也象征了国人对田园牧歌式生活的追求与向往，田园诗派文人的金句佳章历久弥新。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;当代年轻人读陶渊明，也追种田文、种田剧（综）。如果说前者构建的乌托邦想象遥远缥缈，隔着时代的丝罗帷幔有些看不真切，那么后者所提供的慰藉，是触手可及且平易近人的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/1f0b0900204242054072a0cdc952588e.jpeg&quot;

data-key=&quot;256838&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;在高速发展的时代，万事万物&lt;/span>;都像上了发条一般狂飙突进，青年人裹挟在湍急潮流间飞速向前，但偶尔也会想在茶余饭后喘口气、寻找情绪出口。因此，节奏缓慢、风景优美的种田文（剧）便是缓解压力的极佳消遣了。而且相比激进的创业故事，种田还有一份笃定的安心感，一分耕耘一分收获，付出和回报总体成正比例。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上世纪六十年代，台湾健康写实主义电影中就存在二元对立的都市or乡村叙事，在一派秀丽的乡野风光中暗含褒贬意图。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;六十年后的今天，“种田流”实则也隐藏了某种创作倾向，乡村往往是治愈系的乌托邦，而都市则是迷茫中的青年人想逃离的异托邦。隔着方寸屏幕，都市人也远程做了一回种田人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;种田文和种田剧虽然存在叙事陈旧、角色脸谱化、节奏略平淡等弱点，但到底是精准击中了一种蔓延且流行的大众情绪。我们不妨多给它们一些成长空间，相信会有更多的爆款出来。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;朱某介绍，他和女友是通过相亲认识的，“谈了差不多八九个月，觉得时间到了，就准备结婚了”。他称，彩礼18万8是当地的“正常行情”，“我们那叫&#39;大包&#39;，这个钱就包括了婚纱照、三金钱这些。18万8我自己有16万8的积蓄，还有2万是找朋友借的”。后来，女友索要额外3万的三金钱，“我说我给不起了，这些也是找人借下来的”，吵架后分手。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;坦率地讲，朱某还是没有放开。坐绿皮火车、住青旅，5个月旅行才花3万多，属于非常节省的那种。这大概因为这是自己存下来的血汗钱，不想大手大脚花了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;更重要的是，他体恤父母的艰辛，表示：“每次相亲我都有点难受，我跟女生一起吃海底捞，看电影啥的，可我父母从来没吃过海底捞。”父母原本打算帮他出太原买房的首付，“我也挺心疼我父母的，他们很多地方都没去过，还一心想着要给我买房子”。自己辞职的事，并没有告诉父母，“以后有机会的话会说，暂时可能不会告诉，怕他们接受不了，说我不务正业”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;可以看出，朱某与父母都是价值观上比较传统的人，脚踏实地，为人质朴，对生活有长远考虑，对婚姻家庭的态度是郑重的。表面上，3万元成了压垮骆驼的最后一根稻草；实际上，朱某恐怕是担心此例一开，以后会没完没了，女友索取3万元的理由是“她闺蜜都是还另外要了3万的三金钱”，攀比是没有尽头的，日后婚姻生活未必能舒心和谐。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从进化心理学的角度看，婚姻或专偶制的起源是：女性有9个月的孕期，婴儿出生后还有哺乳期，人类的孩子到成年时间很长，且需要习得各种生存技能，这就需要一个父亲的角色，给母子提供保护与生存资源，并对子女言传身教；男人得到的是通过婚姻降低父子不确定性（paternal uncertainty），承担家庭责任、社会意义上的父亲是文化建构的产物。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;无论中西，传统婚姻价值观，底层逻辑都是这一套。只不过，进入现代社会之后，这一套价值观先是受到了个人主义的冲击，进而受到进步主义/后现代主义的解构，越来越难以为继。养育自己的孩子有持续的获得感与幸福感，然而确实辛苦，耗费金钱与心力，也需要责任感与延迟满足能力Vs立马花钱享受当下、及时行乐，潇洒的“现代人”会选择哪一种？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一方面，当某些女性抱怨自己从婚姻中得到了什么，某些男性也会反思自己为什么要结婚。当某些女性论及生男生女与所谓冠姓权时对男方说“你家难道有皇位要继承”，某些男性也会恍然大悟，反躬自问：我家确实没有皇位要继承，那么我花大价钱结婚、含辛茹苦养育子女值得吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当越来越多的男女追问“结婚组建家庭生儿育女的意义何在”，本身就意味着生育本能的衰弱与婚姻家庭价值观的式微，进而意味着生育收益端的价值减记。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另一方面，彩礼与传统社会的聘礼不是一回事。彩礼是底层男性为了进入婚姻市场而支付的对价，但近些年不断走高且不断泛化。婚姻市场是分区域、多层次的复合结构，底层市场可能是男多女少，但顶层市场可能是女多男少，按照供求关系的逻辑，男多女少时男方支付彩礼，女多男少时是否会反过来？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;拿到彩礼结婚几天后闹离婚，彩礼全退几乎是不可能的；一方把另一方的名字加到房产证上，失去半套房子。“谈感情伤钱”，出资方面临的风险越来越大。在婚姻市场上，出资方作为甲方，面对过高的要求与成本，会考虑减少交易，这是从生育成本端对婚姻的挤压。朱某因女方彩礼临时加价而退婚，是又一个鲜活的案例。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现代社会，男女的自我意识都在不断强化，即所谓“自我觉醒”。既然有女性觉醒，就会有男性觉醒，觉醒最终一定是双向的。觉醒或有先后，但对等才是终局，才是稳定均衡（stable equilibrium）。一个随时间演化的系统中，暂态解（transient state solution）是暂时现象，长期稳定解（long-term steady solution）才是最终结果。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2015年，郑州一位女教师辞职信“世界那么大，我想去看看”走红网络，舆论盛赞她自我觉醒、勇于追求个人自由、活出自我。朱某决定退婚，然后基于同样的动机，花自己的积蓄去环游中国，也理应得到同样的评价。作为一个成年人，无论男女，不想过循规蹈矩、按部就班的生活，想要追逐自己的梦想，也能为自己的决定负责，就无可厚非。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;男女未来会觉醒到什么程度？未来能稳定下来的婚姻家庭究竟是什么形态？不好说，但有一点是肯定的：必定是基于男女对等的原则，在男女对等之上形成新的稳定均衡。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;任何一个值得的婚姻，必定建立在爱与道德的基础上。唯有如此，家才是让人身心放松的港湾，而不是精神内耗的修罗场。这就需要各种对等：爱的对等，家庭责任感的对等，付出的对等，提供情绪价值的对等……一方永远付出、另一方永远榨取的关系行之不远。故而，在发现正进入这样的关系之时，有必要及时止损；或者，在发现已进入这样的关系之后，有必要抽身离开，谁能否认这是一种觉醒呢？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;
