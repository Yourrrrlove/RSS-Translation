Influenza, this familiar “old friend” will also arrive as scheduled. Most people don&#39;t think of the flu as a serious illness. The typical symptoms of a sore throat, runny nose, and muscle aches are often the same as a bad cold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the COVID-19 epidemic, influenza was the first infectious disease to be monitored globally by the World Health Organization (WHO). According to WHO statistics, seasonal influenza kills 290,000 to 650,000 people every year. Part of the reason why influenza is so destructive is that the virus mutates quickly, and people who have been infected with influenza viruses in the past cannot develop defenses against new viruses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In our country, influenza is a seriously underestimated infectious disease. A large number of people are infected with influenza every year, and the health risks and disease burden it brings are far greater than imagined. A meta-analysis by scholars on the results of influenza epidemiological surveys conducted in different cities in my country in different years concluded that the annual number of influenza cases in China from 2011 to 2019 was approximately 84 million to 144 million. From the 2010-2011 to 2014-2015 epidemic season, there were an average of 88,000 excess deaths from influenza-related respiratory diseases in my country every year, of which 80% of the excess influenza-related deaths among the elderly over 60 years old accounted for the entire population. The risk of illness in children is about 1.5-3 times that of adults; pregnant women infected with influenza during pregnancy increase the risk of severe illness and stillbirth. A systematic review analyzed the economic burden caused by influenza in my country. Among them, outpatient cases in all age groups were 768-1,000 yuan/person, inpatient cases averaged 9,832 yuan/person, and direct medical care for children 5 years old and under and elderly people over 60 years old for inpatient cases. The cost is much higher than other groups. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike many new infectious diseases, influenza scientists are already very familiar with it. The World Health Organization updates the antigenic components of influenza vaccines every year based on global surveillance and provides candidate strains for vaccine preparation. , for industry to develop the latest influenza vaccines. Although the mutation of new strains causes fluctuations in the effectiveness of influenza vaccines, vaccination is still the most cost-effective way to prevent influenza and complications. WHO recommends that countries set vaccination rate targets for recommended vaccination groups such as the elderly. 75%. In my country, the influenza vaccination rate is only 2%-4%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The status of influenza vaccination in my country is very unsatisfactory.” Peng Zhibin, associate researcher at the Infectious Disease Management Division of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, disclosed at the 2022 National Vaccine and Health Conference that during the 2021~2022 influenza season, vaccines The vaccination rate was only 2.46%, a year-on-year decrease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because the vaccination rate is too low, the annual scrap rate of corporate influenza vaccines is as high as 20%-40%. How to improve the vaccination rate of influenza vaccine in my country and protect the public health has been a difficult problem that has long troubled public health researchers. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Three major factors&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Recently, the team of Professor Feng Luzhao, deputy dean of the School of Group Medicine and Public Health of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, conducted a study on influenza vaccination in my country. The current situation and problems are summarized, and a series of strategic suggestions are put forward to promote influenza vaccination in my country. This article was published on September 12, 2023 as the output of the &quot;Vaccine Delivery Research Innovation Laboratory&quot; project at Duke Kunshan University . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What factors influence the low influenza vaccination rate? Professor Feng Luzhao’s research pointed out that three factors affect my country’s influenza vaccination rate:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, vaccine hesitancy caused by cognitive misunderstandings about influenza viruses and influenza vaccines. The survey shows that &quot;thinking that you are in good health and do not need to get a flu vaccine&quot; and &quot;even if you get the flu will not cause serious consequences&quot; are the main reasons for people&#39;s flu vaccine hesitancy; more than 40% of public health personnel believe that the flu will not cause serious consequences. disease, 18% of public health workers and 45% of medical workers said they lacked confidence in answering questions about influenza vaccines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, the cost is closely related to the influenza vaccination rate. In my country, the influenza vaccine is a non-immunization program vaccine and needs to be vaccinated at your own expense. In recent years, some provinces and cities have included influenza vaccines as local free services, which has greatly increased the vaccination rate in some areas. According to a survey by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the vaccination rate of people in areas with free influenza vaccination can exceed 50%, and the medical insurance reimbursement policy can also increase the vaccination rate to a certain extent, while the vaccination rate of self-paying people is only 1.8%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, the current vaccination system does not match actual needs. It is the best time to vaccinate against influenza before the epidemic season. my country’s annual vaccination work is concentrated between September and December. At present, influenza vaccination services mainly rely on vaccination clinics of the children&#39;s immunization program. Most vaccination sites only provide influenza vaccination for 1-2 half days on working days, which is not suitable for the annual concentrated vaccination demand. From the perspective of vaccination services, demand exceeds supply and it is difficult to make appointments for vaccination services, resulting in poor accessibility and convenience. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Others&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The 1918 influenza pandemic struck with almost unimaginable intensity and speed - infecting one-third of the Earth&#39;s population One (about 500 million people). Since then, all countries have been actively establishing public health systems to prevent influenza and exploring effective promotion measures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Getting people to take the initiative to get vaccinated is the top priority of public health actions in all countries. As of 2021, 65% of WHO member states (128 countries and regions) have included influenza vaccination for high-risk groups such as the elderly and medical staff in national immunization plans or public health projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Professor Feng Luzhao was a member of the WHO Advisory Committee on Immunization (SAGE) Influenza Vaccine Working Group and currently serves as an expert on the WHO New Influenza Vaccine Comprehensive Value Assessment Advisory Group. He studied influenza vaccination promotion strategies in many countries and found that many countries have rich experience in policy advocacy, improving vaccination accessibility, motivating vaccination service providers, and monitoring influenza vaccination behaviors and social drivers. The successful experience of the intervention measures effectively increased the influenza vaccination rate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Research found that many countries have included influenza vaccines in national immunization plans or introduced compulsory vaccination strategies. For example, in order to reduce the risk of infection among medical workers and patients, the health administration departments of the United States and Canada require medical workers and nursing home staff to receive influenza vaccines compulsorily. Secondly, we should vigorously increase the number and convenience of vaccination service points. In North America and European countries, influenza vaccination points have covered pharmacies, supermarkets, private clinics, hospitals and other places. Implementing incentive policies for service providers is also an effective means. The United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, etc. use the influenza vaccination rate of key groups as a performance evaluation indicator for medical personnel. The United Kingdom provides general practitioners with influenza-related educational materials and implements a performance incentive strategy to encourage medical staff to achieve the established influenza vaccination rate target and provide financial or material incentives to promote medical staff to vaccinate and recommend influenza vaccines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, some innovative incentives can also increase the willingness of medical staff to be vaccinated. In 2017, institutions such as Birmingham Children&#39;s Hospital in the UK implemented a vaccination campaign. When a medical staff completed the influenza vaccination, Medical institutions will donate 10 tetanus vaccines to children or mothers in developing countries through UNICEF. This measure has enabled the influenza vaccination rate of medical staff in these institutions to reach 95.7%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the procurement challenges caused by the uncertainty of demand for influenza vaccines and the diversity of strains, the &quot;Vaccine Delivery Research Innovation Laboratory&quot; once summarized the experience of developed countries and found that through quantity commitments during the procurement process, etc. The method of linking quantity and price is often conducive to lowering prices. For example, the UK allows manufacturers to give different quotations based on different purchase quantities during the bidding process (often the larger the purchase quantity, the lower the price), thereby effectively utilizing economies of scale and reducing manufacturer risks. The Canadian government will require each province or region to estimate its demand before awarding contracts to manufacturers, and requires each province or region to purchase at least 75% of its estimated amount, thus forming a quantity guarantee for manufacturers. At the same time, the government uses long-term contracts to reduce manufacturers&#39; risks, lower the price of vaccine procurement and increase the stability of vaccine supply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the public, extensive scientific and educational propaganda is also indispensable. The status of influenza vaccination in 15 European countries reminds that government departments&#39; monitoring of influenza vaccination rates and sending text message reminders for free vaccination are important factors in promoting vaccination among target groups. The United States, through media propaganda, not only increased the influenza vaccination rate among the elderly by 8%, but also advanced the vaccination time by 1.8-4.1 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These state-led measures have achieved remarkable results. Taking the elderly as an example, Brazil’s vaccination rate is as high as 89%; the UK’s vaccination rate for people over 65 years old has remained above 70% since 2004; the United States has maintained a vaccination rate of more than 70% for many years. Maintained above 60%; Canada, Spain, and New Zealand are about 60%-70%, and France, Australia, and Japan are about 50%-60%. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Strategic Recommendations&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Influenza vaccination can significantly reduce the risk of influenza and complications, and effectively reduce the number of outpatient and emergency visits, hospitalizations and deaths from influenza-related diseases. , the cost-effectiveness is very obvious. Since 2020, scientists have monitored and found that influenza and the new coronavirus are showing an alternating epidemic trend. Multiple studies have confirmed that co-infection with the new coronavirus and influenza virus will increase the risk of hospitalization and complicate the patient&#39;s condition. For years, scientists have emphasized the importance of influenza vaccination, but increasing vaccination rates remains difficult. In view of the low influenza vaccination rate in my country, Professor Feng Luzhao&#39;s team put forward the following strategic suggestions for policy makers to refer to:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Vaccine hesitancy has left many groups who should have received influenza vaccines in a &quot;streaking&quot; state. &quot;Health education should identify effective ways to target the public&#39;s misunderstandings about influenza and vaccines, especially for the elderly, primary and secondary school students and other groups covered by free programs, study the influencing factors of vaccination and effective intervention measures, and carry out precise publicity and science popularization .&quot; In the view of Professor Feng Luzhao, all localities should actively improve the public&#39;s understanding of influenza and enhance vaccine confidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For key groups, the study recommends gradually promoting free influenza vaccination for the elderly, primary and secondary school students, medical staff, etc., and striving to include influenza vaccination within the payment scope of basic medical insurance. They also encourage medical institutions at all levels to set up adult vaccination clinics, continuously strengthen the public health and prevention responsibilities of medical staff through continuing education, vocational training, etc., explore the right of medical staff to prescribe vaccines, and incorporate vaccination work into the evaluation system of medical institutions. Increase the enthusiasm of medical staff in recommending influenza vaccination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, in view of the high scrap rate of influenza vaccines every year, we can learn from international experience and sign long-term (such as not less than five years) contracts for influenza vaccines with enterprises, purchase in quantities, and ensure supply based on quantities. , not only can share market risks, but also ensure the stable growth of enterprise production capacity. Avoid the situation of annual production and large amounts of scrapping. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People don’t know when we will encounter another influenza pandemic, but it cannot be ruled out that it will happen again. As the WHO says: At the heart of an effective pandemic response is a strong, well-resourced health system. These include well-trained health workers; effective water, sanitation and hygiene systems; quality rapid diagnostic laboratory services; access to medical products, including vaccines; and reliable systems for tracking and reporting disease cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2023, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) updated the 2023-2024 influenza vaccine ingredient changes and vaccination recommendations, reminding the public that it is best to get vaccinated in September or October. In China, the 2023-2024 batch of influenza vaccines have arrived in various places and are open for reservation. According to the CDC surveillance data, the positive rate of influenza virus testing in some southern provinces has been rising slightly since the end of July. For individuals, facing the seasonal epidemic of influenza, proactive protection and vaccination to minimize the harm of the virus are practical choices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[店员控住偷窃女子：这不是执法权而是公民扭送权丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256574]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-13 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a netizen shot and uploaded a video:&amp;nbsp;On September 7, in Joy City, Xidan, Beijing, A woman was caught shoplifting in a cosmetics store. Two men (presumably both clerks) grabbed her arms and controlled her. The woman struggled hard and tried to escape and shouted &quot;Help&quot;. When a man called the police as if to call the police, the woman Once she broke away, the second man immediately hugged the woman&#39;s waist. At this time, an aunt who was watching stood up and asked, and the second man replied &quot;thief&quot;. The aunt yelled, &quot;Thieves are human beings too.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On social media platforms, many netizens believe that store clerks or security guards have the right to catch thieves, but aunts are not alone. There are also voices on the Internet that &quot;security guards or store clerks have no law enforcement power and have no right to restrict women&#39;s personal freedom.&quot; For example, some netizens said: &quot;Auntie is right. Although thieves are hateful, these two men are not law enforcement officers. There should be boundaries in their behavior. The behavior seen so far can easily cross the boundary and get themselves into trouble.&quot; This is a very representative point of view, so it deserves analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, it is correct that only law enforcement officers authorized by law have the power to enforce the law, but it does not mean that ordinary people have no right to defend their natural rights such as life, property and freedom. Going back to the above case, if these two men are the owners of the store, they are blameless in protecting their property; if they are not the owners, as employees (clerks or security guards) of the store and shopping mall, their duty is to protect the store. Or the goods in the shopping mall are protected from theft, which means that the owner of the goods authorizes them to protect the safety of the property. The cosmetics sold in such stores in shopping malls are generally expensive. If the store staff neglects to take precautions and protection, or just sit back and do nothing when they see someone stealing goods, then they will not only be derelict in their responsibility, but may also be required to bear the cost of the goods. loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people may say that if you see someone stealing cosmetics, just let them keep the cosmetics and then let them go. Why not forgive them? If you do this in a single incident, it seems that the store or shopping mall has no losses, but it undoubtedly creates an incentive: if you steal something from this store or shopping mall, as long as you are not caught, it is yours; if you are caught, it will only be yours. By leaving something behind, the individual can escape unscathed. The mathematical expectation of stealing is positive, which calls the thief to &quot;be stupid, have plenty of money, and come quickly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, store clerks, security guards or ordinary passers-by can control existing thieves, restrict their personal freedom, and either call the police and wait for the police to deal with them, or transfer them to the police. This is not the so-called &quot;law enforcement power&quot; , but the right of citizens to transfer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 84 of the current Criminal Procedure Law stipulates: Any citizen may immediately transfer a person to the public security organ, the People’s Procuratorate or the People’s Court for handling under the following circumstances: (1) While committing a crime or immediately after committing a crime Being discovered; (2) being wanted; (3) escaping from prison; (4) being hunted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, if the above-mentioned woman stole valuable cosmetics, she might fall into the first situation. Article 264 of the Criminal Law stipulates that whoever steals public or private property in a relatively large amount, or commits multiple thefts, burglaries, thefts with weapons, or pickpockets shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention, or surveillance, and shall also or solely be fined... …The &quot;Interpretation of Several Issues Concerning the Application of Laws in Handling Criminal Cases of Theft&quot; stipulates that theft of public and private property worth more than 1,000 yuan to 3,000 yuan shall be deemed as a &quot;large amount&quot; as stipulated in Article 264 of the Criminal Law, and also That is to say, the threshold for imprisonment is one thousand yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the case where the above-mentioned woman was caught stealing and suspected of a criminal offence, anyone can exercise the citizen&#39;s right to surrender. During the implementation process, the woman&#39;s personal freedom and freedom of movement will inevitably be restricted, which is also the proper meaning of the citizen&#39;s right to transfer. If a woman &quot;voluntarily&quot; goes to the public security organ or waits for the police to come to her door under the supervision and escort of everyone, the two clerks can certainly behave in a more polite manner, but no matter how &quot;gentle&quot; the clerk&#39;s behavior is, it is based on the fact that the woman&#39;s personal freedom has been temporarily suspended. based on restrictions. A woman is more &quot;gentle&quot; if she cooperates with the clerk, and less &quot;gentle&quot; if she doesn&#39;t cooperate with the clerk. In the final analysis, there is a certain reciprocal relationship between the actions of both parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, a store or shopping mall has the right to formulate and implement rules within its property scope, which is a manifestation of property rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, if the zoo requires visitors not to feed the animals, otherwise they may be asked out on the spot and blacklisted for refusing transactions. Shops or shopping malls require customers not to make loud noises or cause trouble and disrupt the peaceful shopping environment. Do not listen to the advice. You may be asked to leave. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These situations also inevitably involve restrictions on customers’ freedom of movement or forced eviction, but this is not a “law enforcement power” but a manifestation of “property rights” because businesses only restrict “their freedom of movement”. The freedom of movement of customers who break the rules &quot;within the property&quot;, that is, refusing such customers to continue to stay &quot;within the property&quot; is like saying to someone who is causing trouble in your home, &quot;Please leave, you are not welcome in my home.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, businesses that restrict the personal freedom of criminals currently in the store or hand them over to the police for processing, or expel unwelcome customers are not exercising the so-called &quot;law enforcement power.&quot; Law enforcement power often involves restricting personal freedom and freedom of movement. However, when restricting the personal freedom and freedom of movement of others, it may be law enforcement officers exercising &quot;law enforcement power&quot;, it may be good citizens exercising their legitimate private rights, or it may be criminals. To commit a crime, as this article demonstrates, we must understand the essential difference between exercising legitimate private rights and committing a crime, and we cannot equate stopping a crime with committing a crime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[4000万中央资金建3个民生项目，竟全烂尾]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256566]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-13 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;video id=&quot;contents-video-0&quot; data-fileid=&quot;5576678021071762841&quot; data-media=&quot; video&quot; data-resource=&quot;tencent&quot; data-filename=&quot;Focus Interview丨Why did three people&#39;s livelihood projects involving more than 40 million yuan of central funds all come to nothing?.mp4&quot; data-cover=&quot;&quot; data-url=&quot;http: //1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/93ffc8dfvodgzp1251434507/9d66c4e85576678021071762841/fz8j2DawytoA.mp4&quot; poster=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot;>; &lt;source src=&quot;http://12514345 07.vod2 .myqcloud.com/93ffc8dfvodgzp1251434507/9d66c4e85576678021071762841/fz8j2DawytoA.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;>;&lt;/video>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, in order to promote the development of local economic and social undertakings, the central finance department will Certain investment fund subsidies will be provided to qualified local government investment projects and enterprise investment projects, covering areas such as affordable housing construction, pollution control, energy conservation and carbon reduction. These funds have played a positive role in promoting local construction. However, during an interview in Changyuan City, Henan Province not long ago, the reporter learned that some local affordable housing supporting projects invested by the central government have become decorations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the contents of the &quot;2016 Central Budgetary Investment Plan for the Construction of Supporting Infrastructure for Indemnified Housing Projects in Henan Province&quot;, the projects included in Changyuan, Henan Province at that time included the Puguang community resettlement housing supporting project and the food company The three projects, including the resettlement housing supporting infrastructure project and the Weizhuang shantytown renovation project in Changyuan County, involve a total of more than 40 million yuan in central budget funds. Seven years have passed. How are these projects being implemented? Have they achieved the expected results? The reporter investigated these three projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/2c5c8dbf497985a7c577e0e7238c94c5.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/2c5c8dbf497985a7c577e0e7238c94c5.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250499&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;We first came to Hepingli Community in Changyuan, where the supporting project of resettlement housing for food companies in the plan was implemented. According to the plan, three three-dimensional garages were built here using central funds as supporting facilities for the community. However, residents reported that the three-dimensional garage was indeed built, but it was not used at all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/80800df64ecbf4c08126c36f5543cf27.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/80800df64ecbf4c08126c36f5543cf27.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250497&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;When I walked into this garage, it was full of dust and flying catkins, and there were no signs of a car parked on the ground. Some places have been damaged, and the circuits have not even been officially connected, and some corners have even become places where garbage is piled. The three-dimensional garage is a mechanical equipment system that can store and store a large number of vehicles, which can solve the problem of insufficient parking spaces on the ground. The built three-dimensional garage is idle and abandoned. What is the reason behind this?

The person in charge of the company undertaking the construction of the garage said that it is most appropriate to use special government funds to build a three-dimensional garage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/47aa3363e5e4ee66f308c75fec70618a.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/47aa3363e5e4ee66f308c75fec70618a.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250488&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Dong Peng, Director of the Shantytown Reconstruction Office of Changyuan City, Henan Province:&lt;/strong>; “If the garage is implemented, it will be beneficial to the people, the government, and individuals. The result will be beneficial to the people. They did not do it well, but they themselves benefited.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no doubt that Aoqi Industrial, the company that built the garage, became the biggest beneficiary of this project. According to the winning bid documents at the time, they won the bid at a price of 4.61 million yuan to build 123 parking spaces, with an average price of nearly 40,000 yuan per parking space. The reporter learned during the interview with Aoqi Industrial that even now, the market price they offer is only about 20,000 yuan per parking space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/a67f6eb37c23d88650bbcbd43ed3fb8c.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/a67f6eb37c23d88650bbcbd43ed3fb8c.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250492&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;The market price is about 20,000 yuan. When the project in this community was implemented, the company won the bid at a price of nearly 40,000 yuan. The profit margin is really not small. Even so, why is the garage still not put into use normally? The reporter&#39;s investigation revealed that the reason behind this is not unrelated to the poor project management of the relevant departments. According to the bidding plan issued by the Changyuan City Shantytown Renovation Office at the time, the bidding content not only included the construction of the three-dimensional garage, but also clearly included &quot;the training, trial operation and delivery of installation and commissioning personnel.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms-emer-res.cctvnews.cctv.com/image/3003/upload/15a347e52fa44d4aabaac9abe3a47192.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 0.5; &quot; width=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cms-emer-res.cctvnews.cctv.com/image/3003/upload/15a347e52fa44d4aabaac9abe3a47192.png&quot; data-key=&quot;media-1694567076243 -8&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only have they not been put into use, in fact, these three garages have not even been completed at the most basic level. The construction of these three garages with a total of 123 parking spaces was completed at the end of 2017. However, in June 2018, the garage builder received a demolition decision from the local planning bureau, requiring them to demolish one of them within 15 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Deputy Director of the Natural Resources and Planning Bureau of Changyuan City, Henan Province&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Mao Yongxia&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;:&lt;/strong>; “Residents also reported it, saying that it affected the lighting , so he issued a demolition penalty decision, but the 15 days were not up, so he demolished it on his own.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the garage was demolished, the company did not find a place to rebuild it, but piled a pile of waste materials in the community. . However, this does not affect the relevant departments from allocating the remaining nearly one million yuan of project funds to the company in 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/9c6f911d1293bab50ccd767bf8547d2d.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/9c6f911d1293bab50ccd767bf8547d2d.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250490&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;The number of parking spaces is insufficient and has not been delivered for use, but the company has received all 4.66 million yuan in financial funds.

The problem of difficult parking in the community has not yet been solved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first project on the schedule ended up running out of funds and the garage became a decoration. What about the next project on the schedule? Let’s take a look at the Puguang community resettlement housing supporting project. The local government submitted an application to build a kindergarten, a clinic and other related facilities, and the central government allocated a total of more than 18 million yuan. However, the reporter walked around the community twice and found no newly built kindergarten. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/b46d588ea3a34e7f7dda17777fc3f608.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/b46d588ea3a34e7f7dda17777fc3f608.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250494&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Song Guangjun, deputy general manager of Henan Great Wall Construction Company:&lt;/strong>; &quot;Originally, I applied for a location in the south district of the community, but that location in the south district was unrealistic.

The central government has allocated a total of 17 million yuan in funds, and it is scheduled to be completed in 2017.

At the construction company of this road, the reporter learned that they actually only received more than 6 million yuan in funding. In accordance with the requirements of relevant documents, local development and reform departments and housing construction departments should take measures to strengthen dynamic supervision of project construction implementation, and projects that cannot be completed on time or fail to pass completion acceptance will be criticized through notices, withdrawn or deducted from the central budget Domestic investment and other measures shall be punished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the reporter&#39;s interview, the local government rectified these problematic projects, and now garages, health rooms, etc. are gradually being put into use.

It must be based on the positioning of economic supervision, focus on the main responsibilities and main businesses, and better play the unique role of auditing in promoting the party’s self-revolution. &quot;On May 23, 2023, Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, President of the State, Chairman of the Central Military Commission, and Director of the Central Audit Commission, emphasized at the first meeting of the 20th Central Audit Committee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meeting pointed out that it is necessary to build a centralized, unified, comprehensive, authoritative and efficient audit supervision system, and omit the audit supervision rights of all localities, departments and units that manage the use of public funds, state-owned assets and state-owned resources. , without exception, forming a normalized and dynamic deterrent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 26, the National Audit Office released the &quot;State Council&#39;s Audit Work Report on the Implementation of the Central Budget and Other Financial Revenues and Expenditures in 2022&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;State Council Audit Report&quot;). Starting from July 20, audit reports from various regions will be released one after another. As of September 10, only Xinjiang, Tibet, and Guizhou have not yet released. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The level of detail in audit reports varies from place to place. The audit reports of Henan, Inner Mongolia, and Sichuan have detailed data. When talking about the problems that occurred, Fujian&#39;s audit report only mentioned irregularities and did not specify the specific amounts. The same is true for the Shaanxi audit report. Most of the issues do not state the amount involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Guangxi published the audit report on the government website, it removed the original text. &quot;A university has received a cumulative financial investment of 131 million yuan in scientific research funds, implemented 862 scientific research projects, and achieved 0 results transformation.&quot; In early August, the above content in the Guangxi audit report became a hot search on Weibo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters carefully read 28 audit reports and reported on the outstanding issues in the audit reports of Hebei, Henan, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Chongqing and Shanghai (see Southern Weekend App&#39;s &quot;Interpretation of Provincial and Municipal Audit Reports&quot; special topic). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The financial problems presented in the audit reports of 28 regions also have common characteristics, including misappropriation of funds, large scale of temporary fiscal payments, idle special debts, illegal lending by city commercial banks and rural credit cooperatives, etc. How to find a solution is the key to the &quot;second half of the article&quot; in audit rectification. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;22&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Lands involved in misappropriation of funds&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Among the 28 provinces that released audit reports, the same problem occurred in 22 places The problem - misappropriation of funds, including transfer payment funds, special debt funds, employment subsidies, project funds, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Two cities and four counties misappropriated 4.491 billion yuan of government special bond funds for 23 projects, which were used for real estate commercial development projects, other debt repayments, and other expenses.” Guangxi audit report wrote. Looking at the audit reports that have been published in various places, 4.491 billion is the highest misappropriation amount. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The misappropriation of funds includes the misappropriation of compulsory education funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relevant agencies in Inner Mongolia audited 469 urban schools and 184 rural schools and found that 21 banner counties misappropriated 265 million yuan of compulsory education funds to make up for the funding gap in other projects; 42 banner counties 991 million yuan Funds for compulsory education are stagnant, resulting in projects such as improving school conditions being unable to be implemented or completed on schedule. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Insufficient funds will cause other problems. &quot;41 banner counties have borrowed 923 teachers on a long-term basis, and 74 primary and secondary schools in 16 banner counties have insufficient staff, and long-term temporary employment of substitute teachers.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chongqing, which is more than a thousand kilometers away from Inner Mongolia, is facing Faced with the same problem, &quot;177 schools in 8 districts and counties illegally used 33.0776 million yuan per student in public funds, training funds, etc. for daily operations and other expenses.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The State Council’s audit report also disclosed the misappropriation of education funds: After an audit of urban and rural compulsory education subsidy funds, it was found that 16 provinces had misappropriated 2.524 billion yuan to balance budgets, repay debts, and issue benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the audit reports of various provinces, the main flow of misappropriated funds is daily expenses or filling a certain funding gap. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“19 units occupied 9.7214 million yuan in employment subsidy funds to make up for the lack of unit administrative funds and office building maintenance and other expenses.” The Hubei audit report stated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many places also use false expenditures to obtain funds. The audit reports of 8 provinces mentioned &quot;false expenditures&quot;, with the largest amount involved being in Sichuan, with 4.832 billion yuan of fictitious expenditures in 4 cities and counties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Two departments and three affiliated units falsely listed electricity expenses of 1.6293 million yuan.&quot; Heilongjiang audit report introduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The audit report of the State Council mentioned that 2 departments and 8 affiliated units obtained 80.7967 million yuan of funds through fictitious expenditures and other methods, of which 4.7185 million yuan was used for food, drink, gifts, etc., or was misappropriated by individuals. . This reflects on one side that behind the false expenditures, there may be corruption issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Budget Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; promulgated in 2019 stipulates that governments at all levels and relevant departments and units are ordered to fail to include all government revenues and expenditures in the budget, or to falsely list revenues and expenditures. To make corrections, the directly responsible person in charge and other directly responsible personnel will be punished by demotion, dismissal, or expulsion in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Hundreds of billions of temporary payments to be solved&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Among the problems found in the provincial audit reports, most of the problems involving the highest amounts are financial temporary payments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found that the issue of temporary payments was mentioned in the audit reports of six provinces including Inner Mongolia and Hebei. Among them, the temporary payment balance in 5 provinces exceeds 10 billion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Financial temporary payments are generally funds temporarily lent by the financial department to budget units. It is required that they should not be left on the books for a long time and should be cleared and settled in a timely manner. The Ministry of Finance stipulates that all localities must digest the fiscal temporary payments formed in 2018 and before by the end of 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The State Council audit report shows that as of the end of 2022, the balance of temporary fiscal payments in 54 regions reached 148.139 billion yuan, an increase of 8.363 billion yuan over the previous year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Inner Mongolia audit report stated, “The balance of temporary payments in 4 cities reached 47.055 billion yuan at the end of 2021, and the progress of digesting the stock is slow. 2 cities at the same level and 8 banner counties (districts) have not completed the digestion progress. Task&quot;. Among the six provinces that have announced temporary payment issues, Inner Mongolia has the highest temporary payment balance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Ministry of Finance stipulates that the newly formed fiscal temporary payment balance after 2019 shall not exceed 5% of the sum of general public budget expenditures and government fund budget expenditures at the same level. Audit reports from Guangxi, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, and Hebei all revealed that some counties and cities failed to meet this requirement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Guangxi audit report shows that as of the end of 2022, the cumulative balance of fiscal temporary payments newly formed after 2019 has exceeded the 5% control line in 10 cities and 54 counties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, the provisional payments in Hubei and Guangxi have not decreased but increased. &quot;As of the end of 2022, the balance of temporary payments in 20 cities and counties reached 26.055 billion yuan, an increase of 1.386 billion yuan over the previous year.&quot; The Hubei audit report revealed that some were used for unbudgeted and over-budget expenditures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2018, the Ministry of Finance issued the &quot;Notice on Strictly Regulating the Management of Temporary Payments of Local Finances&quot;, requiring the financial department not to lend to enterprises, nor to lend to enterprises through other budget units. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, illegal lending to enterprises still exists today. The Inner Mongolia audit report stated that “one city level and three banner districts illegally lent 4.585 billion yuan to enterprises.” The Hebei audit report also showed that four cities illegally lent 1.068 billion yuan to enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Excessive temporary payment balances will crowd out other funds for special purposes and normal treasury funds, creating a situation where &quot;the budget has targets, but the treasury has no cash.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The gap between local revenue and expenditure is widening, and it is difficult to get back the money borrowed.” A financial bureau official in a coastal province told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;2022 Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Final Accounts Report at the Level&quot; released in July 2023 stated that it is necessary to establish a classified management mechanism for temporary payments, steadily digest the stock, strictly control the increment, and promote the maintenance of temporary payments at the grassroots level. Reasonable scale, gradually replenishing the occupied treasury funds, and ensuring within-budget expenditure needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Tens of billions of special bonds are idle&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As an important means for the government to stimulate consumption and expand domestic demand, special bonds have become the focus of audit reports in various places . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;19 of the 28 provincial audit reports mentioned problems with special debt. Among them, 12 reports stated that special bonds were idle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Local government special bonds, also known as &quot;special bonds&quot;, refer to bonds issued by provincial governments for public welfare projects with certain returns. For a long time, it has mainly invested in social basic investment fields. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If it is a general bond, it is mainly invested in non-profit public welfare projects, and the source of principal and interest repayment is general public budget revenue. In contrast, the repayment funds for special bonds are government fund income, special income and refinancing special bond funds, which are required to achieve a balance between project revenue and expenditure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Audit reports in some regions revealed that some special bond funds have been idle for as long as a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Jiangsu audit report stated that the audit agency randomly inspected 62 cities and counties and found that as of the end of 2022, the government special bond funds for 337 projects in 54 cities and counties had not been fully put into use, with a balance of 22.944 billion yuan. Among them, 9.123 billion yuan has a balance of more than one year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Provincial-level bond funds are 1.954 billion yuan, which have been idle for up to 247 days; 29 cities and counties including Nanyang have bond funds of 6.637 billion yuan, which have been idle for up to 300 days.&quot; Henan audit report revealed . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the special bonds are idle, in addition to the original investment goals being unable to be achieved, the local government also needs to pay interest on the funds. If the special debt remains on the books for one more day, it will incur a lot of additional costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to data from the Ministry of Finance, the average interest rate of special bonds is slightly higher than that of general bonds. As of the end of July 2023, the average interest rate on local government bonds was 3.33%. Among them, general bonds 3.31% and special bonds 3.34%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taking the Jiangsu audit report as an example, the balance of special debt funds for more than one year is 9.123 billion yuan. Calculated based on the average interest rate of special bonds of 3.34%, approximately 305 million yuan in interest will be paid per year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What causes tens of billions of special bonds to remain idle? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the audit reports from various places, it is mainly due to problems in the preliminary preparation stage. For example, Jilin admitted in its audit report that due to failure to obtain construction land procedures and other reasons, project preparations were insufficient and it was difficult to start construction on time. 22 projects in 7 cities and counties had 5.993 billion yuan of idle funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Jiangsu audit report states that special bonds are idle because &quot;the conditions for starting construction projects are immature, implementation progress is lagging, or bond funding arrangements are ahead of schedule, etc.&quot; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wen Laicheng, a professor at the Central University of Finance and Economics, told Southern Weekend reporters that according to normal procedures, after the project completes all government approval procedures, it will then be reported to the provincial-level finance department to apply for the issuance of special bonds, and the funds will be available immediately. start. However, some local governments begin to declare special bonds when they go through the approval process, and the financial department sometimes agrees to issue them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He explained that special bonds are government investment projects, and more than 20 government departments are involved in the review and approval. If one department disagrees, the project cannot start construction. Even if the special bond funds are in place, there is no way to use them and it is easy to become idle. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;City commercial banks&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;, &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Rural Credit Cooperatives lending illegally&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In addition to paying close attention to issues in the financial field , the audit report also focuses on the chaos in the financial system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eight provincial audit reports mentioned that many city commercial banks and rural credit cooperatives have loopholes in risk management and compliance, compliance operations and other sectors. Among them, the largest amount involved was illegal lending. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years, the competent authorities have been tightening the space for regional commercial banks to lend in other places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Commercial Bank Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China (Revised Draft)&quot; promulgated in 2020 requires that regional commercial banks such as urban commercial banks, rural commercial banks, village and town banks, etc., shall carry out banking operations in accordance with the law within the scope of their residence. Business activities shall not be carried out across regions without approval. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Hebei audit department found that eight city commercial banks issued loans in violation of regulations, including issuing loans to customers or related parties whose loans were overdue, and that different branches within a jurisdiction issued loans to the same borrower, violating regulations. The amount of loans involved is 40.6 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nine city commercial banks failed to strictly implement the &quot;three loan checks&quot; system, resulting in greater risks in 5.959 billion yuan of loan funds. &quot;Three Loan Inspections&quot; refers to pre-loan investigation, loan review, and post-loan inspection. This system enables banks to understand the operating conditions of borrowers, determine loan risks, and is also an important basis for subsequent accountability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Jiangxi audit report disclosed that 32 rural commercial banks had lax &quot;three loan inspections&quot; and illegally granted loans of 2.502 billion yuan to borrowers who did not meet the conditions such as credit reporting. 29 rural commercial banks failed to effectively track and inspect the use of loan funds, and 4.79 billion yuan of credit funds were misappropriated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to illegal lending, there are also problems in the risk management and control of many city commercial banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the Jiangxi audit report, 28 rural commercial banks concealed loan risks by adjusting loan classification results in violation of regulations and repaying loans with loans, underreporting non-performing loans by 2.552 billion yuan; 8 rural commercial banks expanded credit in violation of regulations and passed We disposed of 1.854 billion yuan of non-performing assets by issuing loans to third parties to assume debts and transferring loans; 23 rural commercial banks wrote off non-performing loans worth 1.626 billion yuan in violation of regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Liaoning audit department focused on investigating the operations of two urban commercial banks and found that &quot;the president and vice president positions of one bank have been vacant for a long time, and some senior managers have not been approved by the regulatory authorities.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Inner Mongolia audit report revealed a detail that 6 leading cadres of a certain county health commission, public security bureau and other government departments and 12 other public officials illegally took shares in 2 rural commercial banks, involving 3.2036 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Do a good job in the &quot;second half of the article&quot; on audit rectification&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The first meeting of the 20th Central Audit Committee emphasized that the &quot;second half of the article&quot; on audit rectification &quot;The first half of the article&quot; is equally important as the problems revealed by the audit and must be promoted in one piece. Supervision and promotion of audit rectification should be regarded as an important starting point for daily supervision, and audit results should be used as an important reference for cadre assessment, appointment and dismissal, rewards and punishments. Those who fail to make rectifications, make perfunctory rectifications, or make false rectifications must be seriously held accountable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2022, the official website of the Guizhou Provincial Audit Office released the &quot;Report on the Rectification of Problems Found in the 2021 Provincial Budget Implementation and Other Financial Revenue and Expenditure Audits.&quot; According to the report, in response to the problem of misappropriation of 1.764 billion yuan of ecological and environmental protection funds in 1 city and 10 counties, the relevant regions have cleaned up the misappropriated resources and environment funds, and 475 million yuan has been rectified through the return of the original channels. The remaining funds are planned to be gradually Return in place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the audit reports of 18 provinces in 2023, there are special chapters to introduce the transfer of clues about disciplinary and illegal violations, or the preliminary rectification of problems found in the audit. According to the official website of the local audit office (bureau), about one year after the audit report is released, a special report will be released to focus on the rectification of problems found in the audit report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Hainan audit report stated that in 2022, the Provincial Audit Office transferred a total of 28 clues to disciplinary and illegal issues, involving 82 people and 440 million yuan. As of June 2023, 7 cases have been settled, 21 cases are being handled, and 12 people have been dealt with. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The transfer matters manifested themselves as illegal decision-making by public officials and abuse of power for personal gain, etc., resulting in the loss and waste of state-owned funds, state-owned assets and state-owned resources, involving 11 cases, 72 people, and 125 million yuan. In addition, the problems of &quot;mutual collusion&quot; and &quot;internal and external collusion&quot; in the field of engineering construction are hidden and diverse, mainly involving illegal project bidding, illegal subcontracting, and bid rigging, involving 5 cases involving 3 people and 278 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The contradiction between fiscal revenue and expenditure has increased, and how to make up for the misappropriated funds has become a difficult problem in the audit and rectification process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An official working in the Audit Office of a southern province told Southern Weekend reporters that after the local government misappropriated funds and was discovered by the audit department, due to rectification requirements, all funds needed to be replenished. However, due to financial constraints, In some places, other funds have been misappropriated to repay the misappropriated funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In the past five years, more than 440,000 units across the country have been audited, and more than 38,000 clues on major issues have been transferred to disciplinary inspection and supervision, judicial and other departments, involving more than 920 billion yuan and more than 51,000 people; promoting revenue growth Saving expenditures and recovering losses of more than 2 trillion yuan.&quot; At the National Audit Work Conference in January 2023, Hou Kai, Auditor General of the National Audit Office, introduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 28, in the report on the State Council’s audit report, Hou Kai said that as of April 2023, the problems discovered in the 2021 audit had been rectified with an amount of 850.111 billion yuan, and the system had been improved by more than 2,900 yuan. items, more than 14,000 people were held accountable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said that the clues to the key issues under supervision are generally progressing smoothly, and some stubborn diseases that have hindered reform and development and have not been resolved for a long time have been eradicated. &quot;The overall pattern of audit rectification has initially taken shape, and the &#39;second half article&#39; of audit work is more authoritative and efficient.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 19:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国家网络安全宣传周丨这些网络安全知识你应知道！]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256584]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-13 18:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;September 11-17, 2023&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;On September 9, 2023, the Office of the People&#39;s Government of Pinggui District, Hezhou City, Guangxi Province released According to a report, the right to operate the canteen of Hezhou No. 5 Senior High School will be investigated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, the school contracted the operating rights of the campus canteen from the fall semester of 2023 to the spring semester of 2024 to a local food wholesale store at a price of 2.24 million yuan. This store was only established one month ago. Arouse public attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the second time in half a month that the high price of a campus canteen has caused heated discussion. On August 22, the five-year rent of the canteen at Huaiji Middle School in Zhaoqing City, Guangdong was auctioned for more than 9.43 million yuan, which is approximately 1.89 million yuan per year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;sky-high price&quot; canteen is not a recent phenomenon. As early as 2016, the canteen of No. 3 Middle School in Nanning, Guangxi was reported by major media because the rent was as high as 1.73 million yuan per year. In the past two years, campus kiosks with annual rents of millions have also emerged in Shaoyang, Hunan and other places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An investigation by Southern Weekend reporters found that it is precisely because the bidding methods for campus canteens are becoming more and more open and transparent that this neglected &quot;big business&quot; has received unprecedented attention, and the scarcity of on-campus canteens has This is the reason for its high price. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;9&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;00&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Big Business&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;September 1, 2023 , Huaiji Middle School has just started, and rows of freshmen are lining up for military training on the playground. This public school established in 2011 has more than 8,300 students, covering junior high school and high school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Across from the school, there are various restaurants and convenience stores. Colorful signs such as Malatang, snail noodles, milk tea, and mobile food stalls are all over the street. At noon, when school was over, the school gate opened and students in blue and white uniforms poured out, making the whole street lively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although school has just started, the news that the rent of the school canteen has been sold at a high price has spread among students and merchants. This 150-square-meter canteen opened on campus and is now a &quot;big business worth 9 million yuan&quot; in the words of students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Surrounding merchants told Southern Weekend reporters that the monthly rent for a nearly 100-square-meter shop opposite Huaiji School is around 2,000 yuan. The rent of the on-campus canteen is more than six times higher than that of the shops outside the campus on a monthly basis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the merchants are not surprised by the rent level on campus. They introduced that Huaiji Middle School implements a semi-closed management. Many students live on campus and only have a few hours of time to go out at noon and afternoon. Most of the time they spend money on campus, and there is only one canteen on campus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;After a military training, if you don&#39;t talk too much in a day, you can sell five or six hundred boxes of drinks alone.&quot; An owner of a milk tea shop in front of the school said that his children study in Huaiji School. The prices of goods sold in the canteen are 5 cents to 1 yuan more expensive than those outside the school. Many students also confirmed this to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xuerui and her husband run a food store in Zhaoqing, supplying canteens to many schools in Zhaoqing. They have been doing this for more than ten years. She told Southern Weekend reporters that the gross profit margin of off-campus canteens is generally 25%-30%, while on-campus canteens can reach 40%, and the main consumers are students living on campus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She made a detailed calculation: the rent for the canteen at Huaiji Middle School is nearly 2 million yuan a year. After deducting labor, water and electricity fees and other costs, the canteen can only breakeven with a daily revenue of about 30,000 yuan. The school has more than 8,300 students. If 4,000 people live on campus and each student consumes 10 yuan per day, the daily turnover can reach 40,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This canteen is located near the west gate of Huaiji Middle School. On September 1, the first day of school, the canteen was busy replenishing goods, and piles of goods were unloaded from the trucks parked at the door. The store has already set up nine shelves and two rows of freezers. In addition to snacks and drinks, it also sells stationery and daily necessities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The winning bid announcement for the Huaiji Middle School canteen does not show the winning bidder information.

The person in charge was named Xu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person in charge surnamed Xu said in an interview that he had no idea when bidding, and he did not know that the price would be so high in the end. In order to compete with his competitors, he gradually raised the price by 30,000 yuan, &quot;thinking that if the other party can do it, we can do it too, and (the final transaction price) is only 30,000 yuan more than the opponent.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The competition for all canteens that are rented through bidding is fierce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to &quot;Upstream News&quot;, in April 2021, the 3-year rental price of the 100-square-meter canteen of the No. 2 Middle School in Xinning County, Shaoyang, Hunan started at 680,000 yuan, and was finally sold for 3.2 million yuan, which is approximately 1.07 million yuan. yuan/year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a video with the background of &quot;Public Auction for the General Operation Rights of Xinning County No. 2 Middle School&#39;s Commissary Department,&quot; bidders kept raising placards to increase their bids, and the auction price continued to rise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Legal Evening News&quot; reported that in 2016, the annual rent of the 172-square-meter canteen of No. 3 Middle School in Nanning, Guangxi was auctioned for 1.73 million yuan. A person who participated in the auction said that a total of 8 bidders participated in the competition and used electronic bidding devices to bid. The bidding started at the bottom of 500,000 yuan, with a minimum increase of 10,000 yuan. The final deal was completed after 44 rounds of bidding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the high rents of some canteens are not paid in one lump sum, which greatly reduces the financial pressure on successful bidders and allows bidders to boldly increase prices when bidding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As clearly stated in the contract for the canteen of Huaiji Middle School, the rent is paid on a monthly basis. The rent is more than 9.3 million yuan for five years, and the monthly payment is about 155,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A staff member in the store also told Southern Weekend reporters that the business can be opened after the first month’s rent is paid. &quot;It&#39;s only a dozen or two hundred thousand. You can do this business if you have money.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Open bidding&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Bid&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Actual In recent years, &quot;sky-high price&quot; canteens have frequently appeared in the news, which is also related to the gradual standardization and openness of the bidding process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public school canteens are state-owned assets, and rental income should be included in the government&#39;s non-tax revenue management. As early as 2004, the Ministry of Finance issued a notice on strengthening the management of government non-tax revenue, proposing that “tendering and auctioning of state-owned resource use rights must be implemented in accordance with the law.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, various places have begun to gradually advance. A staff member of the Gaoyao District Finance Bureau recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that the district began to gradually regulate the leasing of canteens in 2009. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;After 2009, the leasing of campus canteens must be approved by the Finance Bureau before bidding. Previously, the school only needed to report to the Education Bureau for approval, and the bidding, auction and listing process was not standardized now.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;In 2016, the director of Nanning No. 3 Middle School Office said in an interview with a reporter from the &quot;Legal Evening News&quot; that at that time, Nanning City was conducting a standardized pilot project on the campus, stripping off the canteen and canteen that were originally bundled together, and starting to open the canteen for rent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the national public resource trading platform, most of the campus canteen bidding announcements that can be retrieved appeared after 2020. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first announcement in Zhaoqing appeared in 2021, and the bidder was Gaoyao No. 2 Middle School. According to the above-mentioned staff member of the Finance Bureau of Gaoyao District, the bidding work for the campus canteen is under the responsibility of the Asset Management Department, which was established at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Stores that do not go through open bidding sometimes have some problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As shown on the official website of Fujian Xiamen No. 10 Middle School, from August 31, 2014 to July 31, 2017, the school canteen and canteen were operated under a bundled contract, and the school organized relevant personnel to form a bid evaluation team to conduct comprehensive Evaluate bids and select the best to win. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The announcement specifically states that spouses of faculty and staff can participate in bidding to help them find employment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The opaque leasing and participation of faculty and staff relatives in the canteen contracting process have repeatedly led to campus corruption. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A case disclosed on the website of the Discipline Inspection and Supervision Committee of Hengzhou City, Guangxi Province in 2021 shows that the principal of a primary school in Shitang Town, Hengzhou City, between 2006 and 2014, sold the school canteen at an annual cost of 8,000 yuan. The price was contracted to his wife to operate. After 2014, the rent was raised to 10,000 yuan per year. His wife will continue to rent it until 2020. The rent is far lower than that of similar elementary school canteens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 2006 to 2020, the primary school’s canteen did not open bids to the public, nor was it submitted to the competent authorities for review and approval, nor was it submitted to the financial department for approval. After being investigated, the principal involved was placed on party probation for two years and had his job grade downgraded. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;New contradictions&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;However, while public bidding enhances the transparency of bidding, it also creates new problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;外界的担忧在于，中标商家可能会通过提高商品售价，将租金成本转嫁到学生身上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年小卖部拍出3年320万租金后，邵阳新宁二中一直面对这样的质疑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位曾负责此次招标的新宁县政府工作人员向南方周末记者透露，以往新宁县也采用公开竞标方式拍卖校园小卖部经营权，年租金大多二三十万元。 2021年因为商家互相竞争，价格被炒得比较高，落选商家将此事爆料给媒体，进而引发了关注。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随后新宁县叫停了此次招标，并对招标情况展开调查。调查结果并没有发现招标过程有违规之处，但政府担心商家在高租金压力下抬高商品价格，难以监管，最终决定关闭县里所有公立学校的校园小卖部。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我们县主要是不能解决这个矛盾。如果以招拍挂把小卖部承包出去，（商家）利润和学生消费（权益）存在矛盾。如果不承包出去，学校不是商业机构，不能作为法人自己经营。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同样因“天价”小卖部引发舆论关注的南宁三中，作出了同样的选择。一位总务处的工作人员告诉南方周末记者，学校已经好几年没有开设小卖部了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以728万拍得高要二中小卖部3年经营权后，承包商在实际经营过程中出现问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据广东电视台《今日一线》栏目报道，该承包商经营不到半年就关门歇业。校方负责人接受采访时称，承包商2021年9月份向学校及教育局提出关门请求，表示经营亏损，无法持续。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;高要二中在小卖部租赁合同中明确要求，“小卖部经营的所有商品必须明码标价，商品价格不得高于市场价格”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张雪瑞曾给该承包商供货，她告诉南方周末记者，截至关门歇业，对方还欠她16万元货款未付。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张雪瑞展示了2021年丈夫对该承包商的微信催款记录，对方表示：“二中做三个多月，保证金24万亏掉，租金连装修，要亏掉六七十万，这六七十万欠供应商一大半，现在需结算完毕，股东们拿钱来付亏损，所以要点时间。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;实际上，对于在校内开设小卖部，有关部门一直有所管控。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2019年12月，教育部、市场监管总局等四部门联合印发《关于落实主体责任强化校园食品安全管理的指导意见》，要求非寄宿制中小学、幼儿园原则上不得在校内设置食品小卖部、超市，已经设置的，要逐步退出。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;高要区教育局一位工作人员向南方周末记者介绍，他们曾反复研讨过这份指导意见，认为意见并没有要求学校完全不能开设小卖部。目前高要区只在寄宿学校中开设小卖部，以满足学生需求。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对政府而言，小卖部租金也是一笔财政收入。上述多地政府部门的工作人员均向南方周末记者表示，按照财政部对非税收入的管理规定，公立学校小卖部作为国有资产，其租金收入目前都统一上缴国库，按收支两条线进行管理。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;综合评分&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;高要区没有对小卖部一关了之，为了解决部分寄宿学校实际需求与“天价”租金之间的矛盾，对招标方式进行了改革。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上述高要区教育局工作人员表示，全区总共有七八十家公办学校，目前25家仍设有校内小卖部。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年3月，高要区将18家租约到期的校内小卖部进行打包，统一招租。评标方式也从“价高者得”变为“综合评分”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;全国公共资源交易平台发布的公告显示，这一整体招租项目5年租金挂牌价1062万元，最终以1221万元成交。平均一家小卖部年租金仅13.6万元，比高要二中之前的价格低两百多万元。中标人为佛山市活道投资有限公司（下称活道投资）。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者探访了其中一家校内小卖部，发现其挂上了广东省道诚百货有限公司（下称道诚百货）的营业执照。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年6月以来，道诚百货先后注册成立18家公司，地址分布在高要区打包招标小卖部的18家公立学校内。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;活道投资与道诚百货是什么关系？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上述高要区教育局工作人员表示，“道诚”是活道投资的品牌。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;企查查显示，活道投资法定代表人为戴朝国，他也曾是道诚百货的法定代表人。 2023年3月1日，道诚百货法定代表人变更为李瑞强，他是道诚百货唯一股东。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年6月，道诚百货与国企肇庆市高要高庆农业科技发展有限公司等，共同投资成立了一家公司，李瑞强任监事。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为什么将18家学校小卖部打包出租，并且租金比之前低？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上述高要区教育局工作人员解释，打包招租是为了方便管理，并规避“天价”租金。招标时也会选择有实力的公司，避免出现后续无力经营的情况。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;具体的评标办法政府方面并未披露，相关公告显示，招标采用综合评分法确定中标人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年9月，肇庆宣卿中学的小卖部招租同样采用综合评分法，学校同时发布了一份评标报告：评标根据技术与商务评审得分、价格评审得分计算综合得分，综合得分高者中标。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;宣卿中学三位中标候选人中，租金报价最高的公司，综合得分最低。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（应受访者要求，张雪瑞为化名）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国际观察｜“美国的手上沾满智利人的鲜血”——起底美国阴谋颠覆阿连德政府始末]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256568]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-13 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;“我将以生命捍卫祖国的宝贵原则。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1973年9月11日，智利首都圣地亚哥，在被政变军人包围的总统府，来自左翼阵营的智利总统萨尔瓦多·阿连德发表广播讲话，表达战斗到底的决心。当天晚些时候，总统府被攻占，阿连德殉职。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“这场政变翻开了智利历史上最黑暗的章节之一。”古巴拉丁美洲通讯社一篇报道这样评价。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;今年9月11日是阿连德政府遭政变推翻50周年纪念日。半个世纪以来，许多历史研究和解密档案显示，美国在阻止阿连德上台和颠覆阿连德政府的过程中费尽心机、不择手段。今年也是美国提出“门罗主义”200年。长期以来，美国抱持霸权主义，操弄“民主自由”话术，利用政变干涉、经济制裁等手段，给拉美国家和人民造成深重苦难。如今，越来越多的拉美国家和人民正在觉醒，反对美国霸权干涉的呼声日益高涨。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;“很明显，要想阻止阿连德政府行使权力，任何形式的政治或宪法途径都不可能成功，唯一有可能成功的机会是在阿连德掌权之前或之后立即发动军事政变……希望情报站尽可能多地与有影响力的军方人物建立直接联系。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1970年9月9日，美国中央情报局将一封秘密电报发给其在智利的情报站。此前，智利总统选举投票刚结束，左翼政党联盟人民团结阵线候选人阿连德得票第一，这令美国政府十分恼火。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美国政府对阿连德的打压可以追溯到1964年。这一年，在上届智利总统选举中落败的阿连德再次参选。彼时，美苏冷战正酣，视拉美为自家“后院”的美国政府不愿看到这名左翼领导人当选智利总统。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;于是，美国秘密扶植阿连德的竞选对手，向阿连德对手的党派提供数百万美元竞选经费，并通过中情局资助智利右翼团体和媒体，发布大量攻击抹黑阿连德的信息，鼓动民众不要给他投票。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美国的干涉行动得偿所愿，阿连德在1964年的总统选举中落败。这些幕后操纵明显违背了美国一贯宣扬的“民主”说辞，但美国政客给出的荒谬理由是：美国干涉对智利造成的损害小于通过民选上台的左翼政府可能带来的危害。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1970年9月4日，智利举行总统选举，再次参选的阿连德得票第一，但未获得半数以上选票。按照法律规定，需由国会在得票前两名的候选人中投票选出总统。眼见拉美即将出现“第二个古巴”，惊慌失措的美国政府决定加大干涉力度，全力阻止阿连德在国会投票中获胜。9月15日，时任美国总统尼克松向中情局局长理查德·赫尔姆斯等人下达指示：“不要考虑风险，不要把大使馆牵扯进来，1000万美元可用资金，必要时再增加。全天工作，选派我们最好的人……让智利的经济痛苦尖叫，48小时内拿出行动计划。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中情局拿出的方案是在智利策动军事政变。中情局后来解密的文件显示，美方当时向一些智利军官承诺，一旦他们发动政变，美国将提供除直接出兵之外的任何援助。时任智利陆军司令雷涅·施奈德坚决反对政变，因此成为中情局的“眼中钉”。1970年10月22日，他遭到一个与中情局有关联的团伙袭击，几天后不治身亡。美国此举弄巧成拙，震惊了智利全国，反对外国干涉的呼声高涨。在10月24日举行的国会投票中，阿连德以明显优势胜出，当选智利总统。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/5c180aa6ab63290afe289dd730c92787.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot;

&lt;p>;政治层面，据美国《纽约时报》报道，美国政府曾拨款81.5万美元，用于在阿连德政府内各党派之间制造分裂。1970年至1973年间，中情局在智利一共花费超过800万美元，其中大部分用于资助右翼反对派团体组织的罢工、示威等活动。与此同时，在1964年智利选举中打磨成熟的中情局“黑色宣传机器”高速运转。智利记者维克托·埃雷罗搜集的资料显示，仅在1973年9月15日至11月3日间，中情局就通过各种渠道在智利国内外发表了726篇抹黑文章，指责阿连德想对媒体施加管控。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经济层面，美国政府为打击智利经济，一方面阻止世界银行和国际货币基金组织等国际金融机构向智利提供贷款，另一方面在国际市场上压低铜价，打击铜产品出口这一智利重要外汇来源。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;军事层面，美国政府公布的《智利秘密行动1963-1973》报告显示，美国持续向智利军方提供援助，对智利军售额也保持在高位，同时还培训大批智利军官，在智利军队内培养亲美势力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在美国一系列破坏打压手段的作用下，到1973年政变发生前夕，阿连德政府已陷入困境：政府内部分裂严重，国内物价飞涨、抗议频发，军队内部也愈发不稳定。最终，在这一年的9月11日，时任智利陆军司令奥古斯托·皮诺切特发动政变，推翻了阿连德政府。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“如果没有美国的支持与资金援助，智利反对派的势力不会那么强。”智利历史学家维克托·布朗吉耶告诉新华社记者。智利学界普遍认为，美国的干涉为智利军队发动政变创造了条件，导致了阿连德政府的垮台。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此后，长达17年的军政府统治给智利造成了巨大伤害。智利官方数据显示，这一时期，智利有超过4万人因政治原因被捕，3000多人死在秘密警察手中或失踪，至少有20万人被迫流亡海外。对此，美国难辞其咎。正如英国《卫报》一篇文章所说：“美国的手上沾满智利人的鲜血。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;智利共产党众议员路易斯·奎略说，美国的干涉“深刻改变了智利的历史进程，违反国际法对各国选择其政治、社会制度权利的保护，是对人权的系统性侵犯”。智利前参议员亚历杭德罗·纳瓦罗说：“美国从来都不关心美洲人民的民主，只关心自己的经济和政治利益。美国将智利和拉美国家都视为自己的&#39;财产&#39;，任何影响美国利益的人都会自动成为其敌人。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/69c4f486f25ac1460659c3de23a5090d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;667&quot;

&lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“门罗主义”是帝国主义强权政治&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;阿连德的悲剧充分暴露了美国的虚伪与霸道。拉美地区的历史证明，当一些国家的政府不合美国之意，华盛顿的政客们就会毫不犹豫地策划鼓动政变，甚至手持屠刀亲自上场。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1915年，海地发生动乱，美国以“保护侨民”为由出兵海地，对该国实施全面控制，直至1934年才撤军。20世纪50年代初，危地马拉政府推行土地改革，将美资联合果品公司的闲置土地分给无地农民。美国政府在联合果品公司游说下，扶持卡斯蒂略·阿马斯发动政变推翻了政府。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美国的种种行径在拉美激起不满。近年来，拉美国家反对美国霸权的意志越来越强烈：2022年3月，巴拿马政府宣布将每年12月20日定为“全国哀悼日”，以纪念美国1989年对巴拿马军事行动中的遇害者；今年1月拉美和加勒比国家共同体峰会期间，与会领导人共同敦促美国结束对古巴的长期封锁；6月，尼加拉瓜总统奥尔特加向联合国秘书长古特雷斯致信，要求美国支付超过120亿美元的赔偿款，履行国际法院20世纪80年代对美国资助尼加拉瓜内战一事作出的判决。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;玻利维亚前外长费尔南多·瓦纳库尼日前接受新华社记者采访时指出，200年来，美国抱持“门罗主义”，将拉美视为“后院”，以霸权主义和干涉行径阻碍拉美国家发展，攫取拉美地区资源。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“&#39;门罗主义&#39;的本质是干涉拉美国家，在拉美推行霸权主义，”瓦纳库尼说，“美国悍然干涉拉美国家内政的事例200年来不胜枚举。这完全就是帝国主义的强权政治，它注定会走向失败，因为越来越多的国家希望自主决定自己的民主、经济模式和国家治理模式。”&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;刷短视频的背后，是老年人无法安放的情感。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（视觉中国/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;流水线女工卢二妹一度把人生逆袭的希望，寄托在做短视频这件事情上。她尝试过记录生活、对口型唱歌，坚持良久却无人问津，最后算下来，流量最好的作品，还是要数和大网红秀才“合拍”的那些内容。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“当所有的浪漫归于自然，宁静致远，你还会不会陪我一起慢慢变老？”在卢二妹置顶的一条视频中，她和秀才的照片被合成在一起，他们面带微笑，相互偎依，在土味情歌伴奏和红心翻飞的特效中，屏幕中打出这段情真意切的“誓词”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不得不说，除了运营视频账号的目的之外，视频里也夹杂着主播和粉丝们对秀才的倾慕之情。这条视频收获两百多个小红心，39条评论，如“天生一对”“和帅哥合拍非常完美”，以及“愿秀才哥哥不变老，和妹妹一直陪伴到老”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;卢二妹为此付出的代价是十多万元的打赏。“有一个姐姐，打赏了五十多万，也没追回来。”在秀才出事之前，卢二妹便对曾经的不冷静和异想天开感到后悔，“现在他的号被封死了，我就很开心”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年9月2日，坐拥上千万粉丝，素有“中老年女性收割机”之称的主播秀才，其短视频账号因违反平台相关规定被封禁。此前，秀才故作羞涩的招牌动作撩头发、捂嘴、抛媚眼，被竞相模仿、恶搞，在各大平台病毒般传播。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;秀才封禁事件也把他的“疯狂粉丝”暴露在镁光灯下。在秀才的粉丝当中，不乏卢二妹这样打赏金额高达十几万元甚至几十万元的“真爱粉”。这些老年情感向主播，究竟有什么样的魅力，能让粉丝们慷慨解囊？这些出手阔绰的中老年人，内心究竟在期盼着什么？&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;诱导性“打回流”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;卢二妹老家是安徽省怀宁县，在江苏省常熟市一家服装厂打工。因为在家族里排行老二，被称为卢二妹，她干脆就把短视频账号起名为“卢家二妹”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她成为秀才粉丝已有三四年时间。刚开始那会儿，秀才只有五六十万粉丝，后来一路飙升到上千万。“说是教我做视频，让我帮他打PK。”卢二妹对南方周末记者回忆二人最初的交流，因为给秀才刷礼物，得到很多与之交流的机会，建立起最初的信任。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据公开信息，秀才是安徽省蒙城人，39岁。他家境一般，早年间和老婆在苏州打工，孩子留在老家读寄宿学校。几年前，在同学的建议下，开始拍摄短视频，刚开始是以农民工题材为主，慢慢转成着西装、对口型唱歌的主播。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;渐渐地，卢二妹萌生起做短视频的想法。她把和秀才的合成视频发在账号上，积累了一些粉丝。不过，要想得到曝光露脸的机会，最直接的方式是在直播间里和秀才互动，而这需要刷礼物。从最基础的小心心、金链子、热气球，到价值不菲的保时捷、直升机，卢二妹一路刷上来，于是频频得到秀才的赞美：妹妹长得挺漂亮、妹妹就要听哥哥的话，等等。秀才还夸二妹视频做得不错，粉丝涨得快，卢二妹很开心，回复说，都是你带得好。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;卢二妹得到秀才带她做账号的承诺，但是索要打赏的要求也愈来愈多。“就让我帮他打PK，喊我去直播间里搭把手。”所谓的打PK，是直播平台中常见的人气比拼形式，主播连麦展示才艺或技巧，号召各自的粉丝通过打赏的方式“上票”，谁得到的打赏多，谁便是PK赛的胜者。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在激烈的角逐中，秀才频频提出打赏“马车”“华子”的要求，“华子”是礼物“嘉年华”的俗称，折合人民币3000元。最多的一次，卢二妹在一场直播中打赏了4000余元，几年下来，她自称消耗掉十几万元的积蓄。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“做账号，带徒弟是比较常见的形式。”梁州（网名）是社交平台上一位知识型博主，她曾在一家MCN公司负责虚拟主播业务，作为短视频平台的深度用户和长期观察者，她因为系列分析“秀才”现象的博文引发关注。她向南方周末记者说，这种承诺教人做账号从而讨要打赏的方式，存在一定程度的欺骗性和诱导性。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;梁州分析，除了“教做账号”的形式外，更多且直接的诱导方式是“打回流”：“就是当托，把直播间人气拉上来。”所谓的打回流是指，主播和粉丝事先约定，粉丝帮忙在直播间刷礼物衬托人气，私下里主播再将其花费金额返还。不过，因为平台会抽水一半，打回流的成本很高，而且由于涉及数据造假，平台并不提倡，甚至是禁止这一行为。所以，打回流通常是MCN机构为了捧新人才会运用的操作。个人的打回流承诺，往往涉嫌一定的诱导、欺骗。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据媒体报道，一位来自北京的62岁女性称，她通过刷礼物的形式向秀才打赏52万余元。她称，之所以如此豪爽，是因为秀才向她承诺，不会亏待她，还会把钱返回，但是承诺一直没有兑现。最近三年，她一直在向秀才讨要这52万元，但是只追回来1.7万元。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“他这无情无义的东西”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;不过，卢二妹的短视频账号没有做起来，粉丝数量停留在一万多，她也没有财力继续打赏，秀才便也不再在直播间里搭理她。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“他说是自愿刷礼物，别人也不可能拿我的手机刷对不对？”2021年，卢二妹去到安徽蒙城找秀才理论，遭到对方的数落，后来还被对方拉黑，“他这无情无义的东西”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;虽然混杂着做短视频账号的想法，但是在粉丝心目中，最被吸引的原因，还是主播提供的情绪价值，只是这种价值需要金钱供养。“这类主播，其实&#39;整活&#39;能力比较差。”梁州分析，很多直播间为了吸引粉丝，会搭建影棚，灯光、道具和陈设一应俱全，才艺展示很丰富，有的还会设计剧本，相对而言，老年人情感向的直播套路会少很多，“老年人不喜欢吵，他们需要的是陪伴”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/UXZYTnTr7JHSV5qkyvCfGgwpNodqtpXVV7xWen9D.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;452&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/UXZYTnTr7JHSV5qkyvCfGgwpNodqtpXVV7xWen9D.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250515&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;秀才的经典羞涩表情。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（网络截图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;梁州注册一个新账号，刻意点赞、收藏老年人视频，从而喂养这个账号的“习惯”，由此打开一个新世界。她第一次在首页推荐里，刷到老年人集体连麦的直播间，连线的用户皆为六十多岁的男性，他们也打PK，观众可以指定他们当中的主播“开擂台”，然后分别给他们上票。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，这场PK没有任何才艺展示，只有和粉丝语音聊天，聊天对象多是中老年女性。梁州通过聊天内容判断，两人彼此熟悉，并不是第一次连麦，主播通过即时通讯软件，喊粉丝过来帮忙“上票”。聊天内容也很寻常：今天喝的什么茶？路好走不好走？下雨了，千万别出门，鞋子会沾上泥。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“这些话，肯定是她在家里听不到的。”梁州说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通过视频和留言判断，这位主播大爷年轻时办过企业，在他们当地村子里算是头面人物。不过，虽然他比秀才年长很多，但是视频风格大同小异，固定场景、固定音乐，通常捧着紫砂壶在泡茶。大爷的账号只有一两万粉丝，但是互动量很高，每个视频都有好几千个点赞，评论数更是接近点赞的一半或是三分之一。通过这一次PK，大爷主播上了6000余票，折合成钱，可以拿到手300元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;秀才最早出圈，是因为2023年5月，一位七旬老太独自坐火车去安徽蒙城寻求线下见面。张姐是秀才同学，曾做过一段时间的短视频拍档，她自称，后来和秀才关系恶化，是因为她发现秀才以答应和粉丝私下见面为诱导，要求粉丝打赏大额礼物。张姐认为，这突破了道德底线，不是一件很光彩的事情。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张姐自认是秀才做短视频的领路人，看到这样的局面感到惭愧，2023年7月，她开始在短视频平台上公开征集被秀才“诱骗”的受害人。一个二十多岁的女孩求助说，父母已经离异，母亲喜欢上秀才后，给对方打赏一万多元，还念叨着要去寻找秀才，她和哥哥怎么劝都劝不住。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“七十几岁的老太太来这里，具体有没有给他打赏不清楚，但是老太太能来到我们这里，绝对他俩是有联系的。”张姐对南方周末记者说。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;秀才的粉丝们&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;梁州还翻阅了上文中大爷主播一位活跃粉丝的账号，其人物形象十分清晰：早年间事业有成，如今丧偶，儿子已经成婚，在大城市定居，她留在老家独居。尤其令人印象深刻的是，这位女性分享欲很强，最多的一次，一天就发了33条视频。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“她似乎没有一个可以在现实生活里说话的人。”梁州说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我支持奶奶刷秀才短视频。”小谢是一位90后，参加工作三年，她向南方周末记者介绍，她的奶奶68岁，前些年身体硬朗的时候，还会去跳一跳广场舞，2022年不小心摔跤导致骨折，康复后很少出门，养成了刷手机的习惯。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;小谢说，她的爷爷早在几年前便用上了智能手机，整天抱着手机刷。爷爷奶奶平时生活中本来就很少交流，爷爷迷上刷手机后，两人更少说话。直到奶奶也用上智能手机，情感有了很大寄托。两个老人家经常刷到晚上一两点才睡，“可以说非常痴迷”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，小谢发现，奶奶的辨别能力非常低，之前很喜欢“假靳东”，但是她看不出来是假的，后来喜欢秀才，视频平台慢慢也冒出很多模仿、冒充秀才的账号，奶奶同样识别不出真假。“分不清是平台还是主播，是机构还是个人，反正她都信。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;每次回去，奶奶会阐述一下自己的择偶观，嘱托孙女，要找就找秀才这一类型的男生做对象，不仅长得好看，还很有本事，同时又善解人意、嘘寒问暖。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;奶奶也动过给秀才打赏的念头。小谢每次回去，她会给爷爷奶奶清理手机内存，取关一些不可靠的账号。她发现，奶奶手机里收到过打赏失败、绑定银行卡失败的短信。“年纪大了，不会操作这些。”两位老人的手机一直就没绑定银行卡。家里人意识到，应该不会挥霍什么钱财，只要老人家高兴，就放心让他们刷短视频。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不光老年人，刷短视频也是卢二妹的精神寄托。“在厂里上班太累，手脚都要动。”卢二妹夫妻俩在江苏常熟的服装厂结识，结婚已经有十多年，不过多年来，老公辗转于常熟、苏州等地打工，两人聚少离多。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在服装厂上班非常枯燥，每个月只放3天假。因为做账号、打赏，她和丈夫的感情出现严重危机，丈夫一个人跑到苏州去干活，两个人很少联系，基本处于冷战状态，“他（老公）怀疑，以为我背叛他似的”。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“老去不意味放弃一切需求”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“老年人的盲目追星跟我们不一样，我们追星买一张演唱会票，至少这种东西都是表面上能看到的，他们是内在的（情感需求）。”张姐说，很多老年人的精神世界里，情感比较匮乏，空虚的内心无法得到安慰。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张姐补充说，男性通常比女性早离世，留下老太太一个人；也有的是男人要去外面赚钱，女人留守，她们的感情世界普遍空虚。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“之前，我看到一个帖子说，女性到了一定年纪，分泌激素下降，就没有性欲了，这肯定是不对的。”梁州说，当一个人步入老年，似乎就在社会意义上丧失了活力这一概念，而这也代表着，与之相关的情欲与情感需求，都不应该出现在老年人身上——这显然是非常不正确的认知。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“陪伴、幽默、爱、谈话和其他许多东西，都是人类的本质需求。我们在年轻时希望得到这一切，但当我们步入老年，年岁的老去并不意味着我们放弃了这一切需求。而社会与周围的人，更不应该直接忽视这一系列需求，这是对基本责任放弃的体现。”梁州说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“秀才走红过程中，老年女性也好，中老年人也好，喜欢秀才我觉得无可厚非。”北京师范大学发展心理研究院教授彭华茂做了多年老年人心理认知、训练的研究，她在观察了一些秀才的短视频和粉丝留言后，认为这些留言是一种较为张扬的情感表达，反映的是老年人的情感需求，“这些评论，有好多是女性对情感的渴求，或者说，对内心自己情感需求的觉醒”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;彭华茂分析，这一群体的情感需求，平时很少得到外界关注，尤其是在中老年女性身上尤为明显。“年轻的时候，都是为家庭生活，到老了以后，在家庭当中的价值没有体现。”她说，与其探究为什么秀才受欢迎，不如去关注中老年人在现实生活当中，他们的情感需求如何满足。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;彭华茂说，社会普遍存在一个认知误区即爱会随着年龄增长而减弱，这才使得大家漠视老年人的心理。而过度的嘲讽和污名化，反而会掩盖掉本质的问题。“所以，我觉得给秀才打赏也好，关注秀才也好，其实都表达了她需要有一个精神的寄托。”&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;在北京南锣鼓巷附近的一家饰品店，当南方周末记者咨询耳环产地、生产商名称、是否有质检报告等问题时，店员露出不可思议的表情：“几十块钱的东西而已，你问这干嘛？”她似乎第一次被这样提问。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;满墙的耳环、耳钉、耳夹被装在一个个小格子里，密密麻麻。射灯下，这些模仿珠宝、玉石和贵金属制成的仿真饰品折射出绚丽的光芒，女孩拿起它们，也拿起了对美的想象。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但美丽的背后，可能暗藏健康风险。许多耳环等仿真饰品是“三无产品”——无生产日期、无质量合格证、无生产厂家，甚至镉、镍、铅等有害元素超标，戴上它们可能会“过敏”，健康亦受到威胁。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;强制性国标《饰品&amp;nbsp;有害元素限量的规定》（GB 28480-2012）对非贵金属（贵金属主要指金、银和铂族金属等8种金属元素）中的有害元素限量做了相关规定，因穿孔与人体接触，耳环比项链等与人体皮肤接触的饰品更严格。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，国标执行已过十年，因为检测成本高、没有强制要求等原因，合金耳环等仿真饰品有害元素超标的案例和召回事件依旧很常见。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“爆款”耳环镉释放量超标七千多倍&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;总销量超过6万件、均价五块多的“爆款”耳环质量如何？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年6月，在某电商平台，环保组织深圳市零废弃环保公益事业发展中心的无毒先锋团队（以下简称“无毒先锋”）下单了销量靠前的10款耳环，送至有资质的第三方实验室检测。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这10款耳环均无质量合格证、产品名称以及生产厂家等信息标识，属于“三无”产品，违反产品质量法。而检测报告更是显示，有3款镉含量超标6808倍、6872倍、7208倍；4款镍释放量超标0.25倍、0.5倍、0.5倍、1.8倍。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/oYt6uFkA6kDbYxGTmA7M4spKESuOui1aCpS6Apd2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;1332&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/oYt6uFkA6kDbYxGTmA7M4spKESuOui1aCpS6Apd2.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;南方周末记者以顾客身份咨询这几位商家所售其他产品的合格证，有的表示“无质量合格证明”，有的则声称“有但不方便提供”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;仿真饰品有害元素超标现象屡见不鲜。2014年，来自珠海市质量计量监督检测所的作者发表论文称，检测珠海市零售市场的40件仿真饰品，有19件有害元素含量超标，“总体质量问题非常严重”。饰品的包装或印记上基本无成分说明，即使大的仿真饰品加工企业，也只冠以“合金/镀银/镀金首饰”等名称。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年，来自广东产品质量监督检验研究院的作者发表论文：检测在网络平台和广州饰品批发市场购买的50批次仿真饰品，有11批次有害元素含量超标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;国家首饰质量检验检测中心主任李素青是国标《饰品&amp;nbsp;有害元素限量的规定》的起草人之一，她向南方周末记者介绍，2007年和2010年，针对国产仿真饰品，美国消费品安全委员会（CPSC）两次提出大规模召回，这引起了国内监管部门重视，也促进了国标的出台。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我国对仿真饰品出口的监管也日趋严格。2011年1月1日起，仿真饰品被列入我国进出口法检产品目录——由国家商检部门制定、调整必须实施检验的进出口商品。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;即便如此，近年来出口饰品的召回新闻依然频繁。在“河北省缺陷产品召回管理中心”官网，以“耳环”为关键词搜索，2018年3月-2022年11月，有62条欧盟发布的耳环产品召回信息，产地大多在中国，缺陷均为镉、镍或铅等有害元素超标。根据检测机构“ETC莱斯检测”统计，2021年第二季度，有66则来自欧洲国家和加拿大关于仿真饰品的召回通报信息，其中中国饰品高达41例。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;尚缺健康影响的量化研究&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;不少人有这种体验，佩戴饰品，尤其是戴耳环时，皮肤发红甚至过敏。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中国环境科学研究院研究员张金良告诉南方周末记者，过敏除了与个人体质有关，另一个主要原因可能是饰品的镍释放量超标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/jF5c9yTRnuv4kqrnnCTfDps3iCEoNsD9dw89Qzv2.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;检测出镍超标的4款耳环。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（无毒先锋/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;仿真饰品的生产流程包含设计、压模、翻砂、烧焊、抛光、电镀等多道工序，出现镉、镍、铅等有害元素超标，是为了饰品更美而成本更低。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方某地一家饰品工厂的设计师李华介绍，镍主要产生于电镀环节，电镀工艺越差，成本越低，也就越容易释放镍。张金良介绍，饰品生产中，加入镉会提高光泽度，还有防锈效果。加入铅能提高饰品柔韧度，便于塑形。铅和镉还是很多色素的主要成分，如果廉价的耳环等饰品色彩丰富，这两种有害元素含量超标的可能性较大。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/guumhbZZDicrgBhye5ii4ryU5TZwZspWZmmQXGHl.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;检测出镉超标的3款耳环，超标量均在七千倍左右。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（无毒先锋/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;原材料质量也很重要。张金良称，一些饰品的原材料使用废弃金属或低质量合金，价格低廉，可能会造成重金属含量超标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;饰品有害元素超标，会威胁人体健康。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张金良表示，镍容易导致皮肤接触性过敏，长期接触镍可能引发接触性皮炎、神经衰弱、癌症反应。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;镉已被国际癌症研究机构（IARC）认证为致癌物，被联合国环境规划署和国际劳动卫生重金属委员会列为第6位危害人体健康的有毒物质。慢性摄入可能引起高血压，增加人患糖尿病的风险，甚至造成严重的骨损伤。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;无毒先锋检测的合金耳环中，有8款检出铅，虽然含量达标，但仍然不建议佩戴。因为铅是一种累积性毒物，可通过呼吸道、消化道、皮肤等途径进入人体，累计到一定数值时会出现铅中毒。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;质量不合格的仿真饰品对儿童健康危害更大。儿童喜欢咬饰品，有的铅制品还有甜味。科学研究证明，铅在儿童呼吸道和肺中的吸收率远高于成人，我国和其他国家也专门对≤14岁儿童佩戴的饰品作出有害元素限量规定。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，近年来仍有儿童饰品召回案例。例如，2021年3月12日至22日，加拿大卫生部相继发布4则儿童仿真首饰品召回通报，涉及4款产品，共计3904件，均为中国生产，召回原因是产品中的铅、镉含量超过当地标准。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，张金良也表示，有害元素的毒性只是理论上的说法，重金属主要通过呼吸道和消化道进入人体，皮肤吸收相对较少。目前，尚未有耳饰重金属暴露量对人体健康影响的定量研究数据；此外，耳饰穿耳部分与人体接触面积较小，若重金属超标，可能会造成一些不良反应，但引起重金属中毒的概率很小，“因此也不必过于危言耸听”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张金良建议，如果长期佩戴耳环等饰品，尽量选择金、银、铂等贵金属，它们的监管较规范，质量较佳。款式多、造型好、价格低的合金饰品，是与贵金属不同的使用场景，佩戴之前可以用酒精清洁，有助于减少饰品表面的重金属暴露，运动、洗澡、游泳等情形也尽量不要佩戴合金饰品，因为汗液接触合金后，可能会增加重金属暴露。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;检测行业藏猫腻&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;我国仿真饰品行业起步于1980年代，中国是目前全球最大仿真饰品出口国，形成了义乌、青岛和广州三大集散地。根据义乌市数据，义乌饰品行业的从业人员有30多万人，年销售200多亿元，占全国饰品行业产值总量2/3以上。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/gRmBhVAobWJmAbyX2sObDLPh7cQTxyOheciRUyAC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/gRmBhVAobWJmAbyX2sObDLPh7cQTxyOheciRUyAC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250509&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2017年11月，青岛机场检验检疫局和流亭机场海关对一批入境仿真饰品进行抽采样并送实验室检测，结果显示该仿真饰品样品的铅超标30余倍。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（视觉中国/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;仿真饰品出口在亚马逊等国际电商平台销售，必须提供符合当地标准的检测证明。例如，欧盟和亚马逊要求商家提供能够证明产品符合“REACH”（欧洲议会和理事会关于化学品注册、评估、授权和限制）法规的声明或检测报告，包含镉、镍、铅等有害元素的数值。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;许多第三方检测公司提供检测服务，但南方周末记者调查发现，检测行业暗藏“猫腻”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者以饰品生产企业身份咨询发现，检测镉、镍、铅释放量，每个样品的收费在500元-800元之间，所需时间为7个工作日左右。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于不少仿真饰品而言，这笔检测费用相当于数百个产品的成本，于是检测服务有了“潜规则”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“可以打擦边球。”淘宝上一家检测机构的客服说，REACH要求每款产品都需提供检测报告，但机构能为多个材质相似的饰品只做一次实测，其他“搭便车”的没有实测的产品，将其照片替换上去，检测数值不变，便也拥有了“专属”的检测报告。上述客服称，该机构最多能支持打包检测的数量为10款。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有的机构客服还介绍了更多数目打包检测的“潜规则”。“超过100款（打包检测）就有点太夸张了，因为出口清关、上平台销售都是有风险的，海关和平台可能会怀疑检测报告的真实性。”这家检测机构的客服杨乐向南方周末记者介绍，客户的这种需求很常见，“考虑到成本问题，不可能每一款产品都拿去测试，所以我们的客户都会以&#39;系列&#39;的名义，将许多款产品放在一起检测”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杨乐表示，如果饰品企业担心产品有害元素实测超标，还可以提供“包下证”服务，出具一份非实测的检测报告，检测结果可以任意填写。“这个检测报告一样要上传备案，虽然我们没有实测，但它跟实测的检测报告是一模一样的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但“包下证”的前提是客户需要与检测机构签订一份免责声明，免去检测公司的责任。杨乐发来的免责声明模板写道：“因考虑到客户需求的时间关系，经过双方协商，检测机构按客户要求评估出证书及报告，同时客户承诺产品是合格的，保证销售市场的产品符合要求，如有不符合情况检测机构不承担任何法律责任及赔偿义务。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杨乐称，“包下证”和多款产品打包检测的收费相同，均为700元。由于“包下证”不需要实测，仅需要5个工作日就可以完成。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;新标准正在修订&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;和大部分产品类似，仿真饰品的监管依据是产品质量法、进出口商品检验法等法律法规。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;产品质量法规定，生产者应当对其生产的产品质量负责；有保障人体健康和人身、财产安全的国家标准、行业标准的，产品质量应当符合该标准。李素青介绍，商家生产和销售的仿真饰品必须符合国标要求，但在国内上市，并不像食品、家电等消费品一样，被要求进行强制性产品认证。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如家电产品必须拿到“3C认证”（China Compulsory Certification，中国强制性产品认证）才能上市。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李素青认为，如果将仿真首饰纳入3C强制目录，也有难度和争议。对于售价为几块钱的耳环来说，如果让商家花几百元做有害元素检测，也不太现实，“既增加了商户和消费者的成本，也增加了执法成本”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;市场监管部门对仿真饰品的监管，主要采取抽检的方式，例如义乌市开展过数次合金饰品专项整治，并以年度为单位开展监督抽查。2022年度抽查的17批次产品，经第三方检测机构检测均合格。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;目前，仿真饰品是否送检，主要看客户需求。“很多客户不需要检测报告，因为这会增加成本。”李华称。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位检测行业资深人士对南方周末记者表示，在国内，天猫、京东等电商平台和一些大型商超卖场，会要求商家提供饰品的质检报告，但一些电商平台和许多线下销售场所并未作此要求。深圳市零废弃环保公益事业发展中心传播主任李本本称，无毒先锋计划2024年在多家电商平台搜集更多耳环样本，调查产品质量。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李素青建议，提高仿真首饰的合格率，须增加企业的违法成本。公开资料中，鲜有饰品生产企业因产品有害元素不合格受到处罚。而产品质量法规定，生产、销售不符合保障人体健康和人身、财产安全的国家标准的产品的，可处违法生产、销售产品货值金额等值以上三倍以下的罚款；情节严重的，吊销营业执照；构成犯罪的，依法追究刑事责任。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;耳环等饰品的造型越来越复杂，成分也不只是仿真金属，还有纺织品甚至包括电池。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李素青透露，11年前颁布的国标正在修订，新版国标在化学性能方面的规定，可能会进一步严格铅含量的限量要求；还可能会增加一些机械物理性能方面的要求，例如对饰品针尖的位置、对含电池的饰品作出某些规定等。具体有哪些变化要以最终标准为准。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（李华、杨乐为化名，南方周末实习生梁成媛亦有贡献）&lt;/p>;
