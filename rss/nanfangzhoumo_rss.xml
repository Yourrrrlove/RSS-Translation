Although two young cosplayers (cosplay enthusiasts) did not win the ticket, they still decided to stay at the entrance of the e-sports center and spend an unforgettable night watching the TV broadcast. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/oupRK0i3RNd0s4DHvrfOBnDXXiOnYwvQj7Qvj2sZ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/oupRK0i3RNd0s4DHvrfOBnDXXiOnYwvQj7Qvj2sZ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252657&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 26, 2023, the final scene of the Honor of Kings Asian Games held at the Hangzhou E-sports Center. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Zhang Rui/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 25, 2023, the Hangzhou Asian Games e-sports event King of Glory Asian Games version half In the final, CCTV Sports and CCTV5+ channels broadcast the game. This is the first time that CCTV broadcasts the Asian Games e-sports competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Coser Yifeng is also a fan artist. She chose this job because of her interest in e-sports. &quot;Ever since (e-sports) entered Asia, I have been explaining (e-sports).&quot; Yifeng told Southern Weekend reporters that three days ago, she and her father watched the opening ceremony of the Asian Games together. When the e-sports players entered, She excitedly pointed it out to her father. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The game of King of Glory is participated by two teams, red and blue, with 5 people in each team. The two teams start teamwork and competitive confrontation on the King&#39;s Canyon map. Cosplayer Lu Zhian said that people around her, including male friends who participated in youth training, were biased against the competitive strength of female players, which gave her the idea of ​​&quot;proving&quot; herself. By watching professional players&#39; e-sports competitions, she learned some game strategies and techniques, and thus improved her rank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A male audience born in the 1980s began to pay attention to e-sports events in 2006 because of &quot;DOTA&quot;. &quot;DOTA2&quot; is one of the e-sports events at the Hangzhou Asian Games. He is also a football fan and talked to Southern Weekend reporters about the similar teamwork and competitiveness between the two, especially the thrill of a desperate comeback at the decisive moment of the game. Going into the game, he was confident of the outcome. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of September 26, in the final of the Asian Games version of the e-sports e-sports King of Glory in Hangzhou, the Chinese team defeated the Malaysian team 2-0 and won the first e-sports gold medal in the history of the Asian Games, and was included in China’s Medal table. The 31 Chinese players participating this time have an average age of about 24 years old. They have played more than 11,000 games in total and have won more than 60 championship trophies in various competitions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is almost a game without any suspense. The cheers at the scene reached their peak when Chinese players appeared on the stage. They came from leagues and clubs that were more professional than their opponents. The sound of cheering accompanies every &quot;attack&quot; in the game. In the second game of the final, the Chinese team even changed players and flattened the opponent&#39;s &quot;base&quot; more cleanly and quickly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/Wn5XEdjfBQOfaV0ZIS9ZBKA5CRLQ7yBofH6lKUdb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height= &quot;683&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/Wn5XEdjfBQOfaV0ZIS9ZBKA5CRLQ7yBofH6lKUdb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252655&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On the evening of September 26, 2023, in Hangzhou, members of the Chinese team took the stage to greet the audience after winning the first e-sports gold medal in the Asian Games. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the first final night of the Asian Games e-sports. When the winner is decided, Hangzhou It seems that the enthusiasm in the e-sports center has not yet had time to be fully unleashed. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Sports in the Digital Age&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;E-sports has a history of at least forty years. In 1980, the &quot;International &#39;Space Invaders&#39;&quot; competition held in New York, USA, was considered the world&#39;s first formal e-sports competition. The champion at that time later became a video game programmer. With the launch of the WCG (World Electronic Sports Competition) after the millennium, Esports, or &quot;electronic sports&quot;, began to become an international event. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Xiaodong, dean and doctoral supervisor of the School of Leisure Sports and Management of Guangzhou Institute of Physical Education, told Southern Weekend reporters that in primitive society, people had invented sports activities such as running and swimming; in agricultural society, people had horse riding, bows and arrows, etc. Activities; In industrial society, people began to ride bicycles, race cars, etc.; &quot;The digital age will definitely use numbers as tools and new sports will appear.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 16, 2023, at the &quot;Asian Games TALK Guangzhou Station&quot; event held at the Guangzhou Library, Xu Deqing, director of the Propaganda Department of the Hangzhou Asian Organizing Committee and deputy director of the Propaganda Department of the Hangzhou Municipal Party Committee, responded to Southern Weekend Reporter’s question about e-sports. Xu Deqing believes that e-sports is a culture of youth, teamwork and innovation. &quot;E-sports is different from games. E-sports is defined as a contest of intelligence, just like chess and Go. It is a contest of intelligence.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the forty competition events at the Hangzhou Asian Games, e-sports are classified as &quot;intellectual events&quot; along with bridge, chess, go and xiangqi. The &quot;World Brain Games Federation&quot; once defined &quot;brain games&quot; as &quot;a sport or game that is related to the mental abilities of the participants rather than their physical advantages.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qi Xin, associate professor and master’s tutor at the Department of Physical Education and Research of Peking University, recalled a scene from 20 years ago. In 2003, the State Sports General Administration listed &quot;e-sports&quot; as the 99th official sports event in my country. At that time, e-sports was still a new thing, and she and her students discussed &quot;whether e-sports is a sport or not&quot; in class. Opponents accounted for the vast majority. In fact, it was not just e-sports, but also chess sports. These sports lacked physical movement and were not well accepted as &quot;sports&quot; at the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past ten years, Qi Xin has clearly felt that the outside world&#39;s perception of sports and e-sports has changed significantly. Peking University has a student-organized e-sports association, and more and more students are participating. According to Qi Xin&#39;s observation, the personal abilities of these students have been developed, such as thinking ability, reaction ability, overall view, willpower and team spirit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few years ago, she met a former professional e-sports player at an event. She listened to the player talk about competitions and training, and her impression of e-sports gradually changed. &quot;In addition to talent, you also need to undergo hard training the day after tomorrow.&quot; Qi Xin said that when the players compete, they are the same as traditional sports athletes. There is nothing else in front of them, only the competition, even if they encounter physical and mental problems. In the difficult situation, he will try his best to win at that moment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“People are gradually realizing that competitiveness is also the core content of e-sports.” Qi Xin listed to Southern Weekend reporters, “In a game, what will be improved physically and mentally, and what will be negative? Appear? How to stimulate team enthusiasm and creativity in e-sports competitions, and cultivate the sports spirit of not admitting defeat, not being discouraged, and fighting tenaciously? These are important research topics.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qi Xin believes that if e-sports Athletes can gain a certain degree of social visibility and recognition like well-known athletes in other sports fields, and they can even participate in college teaching in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different from traditional domestic sports, e-sports events have always been promoted from the bottom up by game manufacturers, e-sports clubs, etc.: e-sports games appear, clubs enter, live broadcast platforms rise, and events gradually improve. Finally entered the Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the news of e-sports entering Asia came, Wang Guoji felt it was &quot;a bit sudden, but not unexpected.&quot; Wang Guoji is the chairman of the e-sports working committee of the China Cultural Management Association. He explained that although e-sports developed from online games, it is quite different from games: &quot;Online games and e-sports, hobbies and professionalism must be clearly understood. Be aware of it and make a clear distinction. It does not mean that today, when Hangzhou holds the Asian Games and 7 e-sports events have become official competition events, online games are fully endorsed.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;We are doing A serious matter&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Industry insiders believe that the entry of e-sports into Asia will bring the e-sports industry into a more standardized direction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qi Xin told Southern Weekend reporters that the difference between &quot;playing e-sports&quot; and &quot;playing games&quot; lies in &quot;sports rules.&quot; E-sports needs to abide by strict sports regulations, which Qi Xin calls &quot;edges and boundaries&quot; to ensure order and control of e-sports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Jing, a staff member involved in the Asian Games e-sports project, said that e-sports projects are gradually becoming &quot;serious&quot;, and the competition format and rules are closer to traditional and formal sports projects. &quot;This is a problem for many manufacturers.&quot; It is a big challenge for the competition team.” In order to adapt to the rules of the Asian Games, some e-sports schedules have been changed. For example, the original five games that decided victory were reduced to three. At least three months in advance, e-sports players must start closed training and implement a diet plan to ensure that they pass doping tests. And these are still unimaginable in the league. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rules are indeed more detailed. Sun Jing said that in 2006, the e-sports management rules totaled about 5,000 words; now, the latest version of the rules has about 120,000 words. &quot;The process of the game, various foul situations, and the details of each event are all broken down in detail,&quot; he told Southern Weekend reporters. &quot;It is still far from the rules of football and basketball, but it is already comparable to the rules of some traditional events. It&#39;s relatively close.&quot; For example, when confirming the start of the game, &quot;the rules state that within 5 minutes of the start of the game, if an irreparable bug is triggered, the game must be replayed.&quot; The industry discussed this for a long time before determining which moment should be counted. &quot;Game start&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the relaxed age requirements for athletes in some traditional sports, such as the current Asian Games, where 13-year-old Cui Chenxi won the women&#39;s skateboarding street finals, the industry has stricter age requirements for e-sports athletes. high. For example, the Zhejiang Provincial E-Sports Association requires that to meet the requirements for registered e-Sports athletes, you must be over 18 years old, complete nine years of compulsory education, and obtain a full-time junior high school diploma or above. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters visited the Hangzhou LGD E-sports Club. Club manager Marseille said that they would not consider minors to become players. The professional age of e-sports players is between 18 and 25 years old, which means that the opportunity to become a professional player is fleeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Club professional testing often dissuades many young people with e-sports ideas. This test tests people&#39;s reaction, instant memory, hand-eye-brain coordination and other abilities through computer and equipment. After multiple rounds of tests, only six people passed all the tests, but after entering the youth training team, they still faced many difficulties. The elimination rate from the youth training to the second team is 67%, and the elimination rate from the second team to the first team is 50%. Some youth training players will leave the club and find another place if they cannot prove that they can participate in higher-level competitions within half a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Pan Jie, CEO of LGD E-Sports Club, said that there is a very detailed evaluation system for talent selection, which not only examines online practical performance, but also offline interviews to evaluate their realistic psychological conditions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Jing told Southern Weekend reporters that some e-sports events are exactly the same as traditional sports. For example, in FPS (first-person shooter) games, he noticed that players need to complete a certain amount of traditional physical exercise to train muscle reaction speed, and the concept of &quot;warm-up&quot; is also introduced. Some high-intensity games are played from morning to night. Without this foundation, it is easy to suffer from physical exhaustion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ying Shunjie is the deputy director of the Shanghai E-sports Education and Training Working Committee and has been engaged in e-sports education for many years. He told Southern Weekend reporters that the e-sports industry has always paid attention to the traditional sports industry, including the training system and management, and is learning from traditional sports. &quot;It pays attention to players&#39; mental health, injury management, daily work and rest, physical functions, etc., these are traditional Something that esports doesn’t have.” He mentioned that the past &quot;Internet cafe-style&quot; model was obviously unhealthy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pan Jie said that the great development of e-sports competitions is due to learning from the game rules, transfer rules, salary caps, etc. of mature sports leagues such as the NBA. However, in the process of learning, traditional sports rules are always &quot;acclimated&quot;, especially how to adapt the rules that serve offline to online. &quot;At the beginning, all the rules were purely competitive, and later they included some commercial terms.&quot; It has also gradually been incorporated into the club system.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Why do we have so many people organizing, media operation center, athlete village, media village, venue competition team, and referee team? Because we are doing a serious thing.&quot; Sun Jing said . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;High-intensity physical exercise, the future of e-sports? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On September 6, 2023, the International Olympic Committee announced the establishment of the International Olympic Committee E-sports Committee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We believe that virtual sports can help promote the core values ​​of the Olympic Movement such as excellence, friendship and respect,” said IOC President Bach. “They can inspire young people around the world to participate in sports activities and have active health. lifestyle.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth mentioning that Bach divided e-sports into three categories: The first category is virtual reality sports, in which there are physical movements and the participants&#39; bodies are faced with (high-intensity) Sports and challenges; the second category involves esports competitions conducted under the rules of international sports federations; and the third category is broader esports. The International Olympic Committee’s priority is Category 1 admission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guangzhou Institute of Physical Education is the first public undergraduate university in China to offer e-sports majors. Wang Xiaodong believes that e-sports is divided into competitions with physical sports and competitions without physical sports, and virtual sports refers to the former. He used simulated racing as an example. The intensity of exercise in a racing simulator is not much different from that in actual racing. They once held a simulation racing competition, and all the children participating in the competition were &quot;full of energy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Xiaodong advocates what Bach calls virtual sports. He told Southern Weekend reporters that the school’s e-sports courses must first learn physical education, and the students are also traditional sports students. He also mentioned the difficulty of these projects. At present, the market competition acceptance of virtual sports is not too high, and the youth base is relatively weak. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with virtual sports, non-physical e-sports events such as &quot;FIFA Online 4&quot;, &quot;Honor of Kings&quot; and &quot;League of Legends&quot; obviously have higher acceptance in the market. The e-sports events at the Hangzhou Asian Games actually cover two directions, including virtual sports events like the former and popular e-sports events like the latter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned that the current investment of domestic clubs is still in the latter, rather than traditional virtual sports projects. Pan Jie analyzed that a club’s investment project needs to consider the user base, market conditions, league system, event viewing, etc. At present, the development of virtual sports is relatively limited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Guoji participated in the Olympic Esports Week held in Singapore in June 2023, and he had a deep feeling. Among the competitions held in Singapore, 9 are virtual sports, such as shooting, taekwondo, dance games, etc. that require physical participation. &quot;With the continuous advancement of electronic equipment, under the current human environment, e-sports, especially virtual sports, has become a new form of sports. This is very positive and healthy, and it also has broad development prospects in the future.&quot; Wang Guoji believes , when humans enter the digital age, some new forms of sports will be born, and they may far exceed traditional forms of sports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a long time, people have believed that there are some problems in non-physical sports competitions. For example, sitting for a long time without exercise is not in line with a healthy spirit. At the same time, the hidden dangers of addiction have also aggravated the concerns of the outside world. Unlike traditional sports, e-sports are likely to be influenced by game copyright owners, which also increases people&#39;s doubts about fairness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qi Xin told Southern Weekend reporters that if e-sports is just a leisure and entertainment activity based on the original games in the future, the direction will be very limited: &quot;If in the future our e-sports is just an intellectual activity I think the challenge may become narrower and narrower. The future direction of e-sports is to develop towards sports, not just games.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The end of the industry is culture&lt;/h4>; &lt;p >;In eighteen years of relevant industry experience, Pan Jie believes that the development of the e-sports industry has always been a &quot;step-by-step&quot; process. Its prosperity is inseparable from the huge user base, especially the enthusiasm of young people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different from the past “rectification of names”, after the professionalization of e-sports, “persuading people to quit” has become an important matter. &quot;Many children use e-sports as an excuse to play games. In fact, they lack talent and do not work hard enough.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, e-sports was selected for the Jakarta Asian Games exhibition competition, and the Chinese team achieved two gold medals and one silver medal. On April 1, 2019, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the State Administration for Market Regulation, and the Bureau of Statistics officially released 13 new occupation information to the public. Among them, the new occupations related to the e-sports industry include e-sports operators and e-sports athletes. item. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, Ying Shunjie could feel the changes brought about by the 2018 Jakarta Asian Games and a series of international events on the e-sports industry. When recruiting employees in the first half of 2018, “most people who come here don’t know what e-sports is, and their levels vary.” Ying Shunjie asked them about their understanding of e-sports, and the answer they got was often related to games. Starting from the second half of the year, Ying Shunjie received more resumes, including some traditional sports practitioners who also started to join. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ying Shunjie said that there is a huge gap in e-sports talents. “It requires practitioners to not only understand the industry rules of e-sports, but also have good professional skills and literacy. This was very difficult before 2018. &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Four years after the Jakarta Asian Games, the &quot;2022 China E-sports Industry Report&quot; shows that China&#39;s e-sports industry revenue in 2022 will be 144.503 billion yuan, the e-sports population will be approximately 488 million, and e-sports events will be held throughout the year 108 items. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an exclusive interview with the media, Chen Weiqiang, Executive Secretary-General of the Hangzhou Asian Organizing Committee and Deputy Mayor of Hangzhou, said frankly that the more long-term consideration for e-sports&#39; &quot;entering Asia&quot; lies in the industry - &quot;entering Asia&quot; through e-sports, Drive the development of Hangzhou and the entire Chinese e-sports industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“From game planning and development to athlete training, event organization, live broadcast commentary and commentary, and big data statistics, the entire e-sports industry chain is very long and contains a lot of content.” Wang Guo Ji told Southern Weekend reporters that in addition to standardization, professionalization and internationalization, industrialization is also very important. Entrusted by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the E-Sports Committee has formulated national vocational skills standards for e-sports players, and related textbooks will be published soon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pan Jie’s club once cooperated with French Ligue 1 football club Paris Saint-Germain. She told Southern Weekend reporters that when she came to Saint-Germain’s home stadium, she found that people did not necessarily go to watch football matches. , but she will definitely visit the surrounding areas of the club. This has almost become a kind of urban culture, which touched her a lot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In one issue of the 2004 TV program &quot;E-Sports World&quot; on CCTV Sports Channel, the column team compiled a sitcom. In the play, the host went to Portugal to cover the European Cup. Before leaving, he had a strange dream: some FIFA football and live football game players turned out to be the head coaches of the 16 national teams in the European Cup...&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;This is a &quot;prophecy&quot; from twenty years ago. At the 2023 Hangzhou Asian Games, eight e-sports events including &quot;FIFA Online 4&quot; have become official competition events of the Asian Games. From September 24 to October 2, the Hangzhou Asian Games e-sports competition will produce a total of 7 gold medals. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Yifeng, Lu Zhian, and Sun Jing are pseudonyms.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[实力悬殊，亚运中国女篮101比46大比分胜蒙古国队]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257842]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-28 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 27, 2023, Pan Zhenqi broke through the opponent&#39;s blockade, and the Chinese women&#39;s basketball players met He has an obvious height advantage over the Mongolian national team.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/f03d1994fe.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;721&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/f03d1994fe.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252644&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 27, 2023, Pan Zhenqi broke through the opponent&#39;s blockade.

The State Administration of Radio, Film and Television has thoroughly implemented the people-centered governance concept. We are determined to mobilize the entire industry to solve this problem as a political project, a popular project and a systematic project. At present, cable TV transmitted through cable TV networks, IPTV transmitted through telecom operators&#39; private networks, and Internet TV OTT transmitted through the Internet have formed three major systems. On the one hand, they meet the diversified needs of the masses. On the other hand, due to the diverse market entities Different levels of participation in TV broadcasting and charging have caused problems such as &quot;matryoshka&quot; charging, which has caused troubles to the people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A working group was set up some time ago to investigate and rank all 7 Internet TV integration platforms, 22 TV manufacturers, All IPTV and cable TV in 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities conducted questionnaire surveys of nearly 10,000 users, communicated with the Central Cyberspace Administration, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the State Administration for Market Regulation, the China Consumers Association and other departments, and listened to all parties involved in the industry chain. opinions and suggestions. On the basis of finding out the bottom line, we will fully promote the governance work in three stages in accordance with the overall planning, step-by-step implementation, easy first, then difficult, and pilot first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first phase, this year we will gradually reduce the fee package by 40% to improve consumption transparency. In the second phase, TV operations and charges will be standardized in the first half of next year. In the third stage, by the end of next year, the long-term management mechanism of the three major business systems of cable TV, IPTV, and OTT will be improved to ensure that the TV &quot;matryoshka&quot; charging problem can be &quot;cured and will not rebound.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first phase of governance work has recently begun, and a total of 7 companies covering the three major systems have been identified: Beijing Gehua Cable, Shandong Provincial Network, Shanghai Mobile, Guangdong Telecom, Jilin China Unicom, Xiaomi TV and Hisense TV pilot unit. Guide and promote relevant enterprises to formulate reduction and consolidation of fee packages, increase subscription management pages, and optimize specific implementation plans for free zones. Among them, Gehua Cable has reduced 14 fee packages to 5, and Guangdong Telecom IPTV has reduced the original 10 film and television categories. The fee package is reduced to 1, and newly shipped Xiaomi TVs and Hisense TVs no longer have pre-installed APKs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is expected that by the end of October this year, the fee package of pilot units will be reduced by more than 40%. From November to December, centralized rectification will be carried out nationwide to reduce the overall fee package by 40%.

While everyone was shocked, they were also asking: Are some children born evil? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps, only if we go deep into the world of minors can we correctly and deeply understand the origin of such events. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, why do seemingly weak and powerless children bully their peers? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, bullying has little to do with physical strength. Bullying is essentially a mentality and method. The purpose is to construct and establish a domination-obedience power relationship between the perpetrator and the victim. The mental pleasure that bullying brings to the perpetrator is a pleasure of dominance. There is no evidence that physically weak people have a weaker desire to conquer and dominate than physically strong people. On the contrary, in some situations, physically weak people have more incentives to pursue a sense of conquest and dominate others in order to make themselves appear stronger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Weak physical strength is only relative, there is always someone weaker than him or her. Moreover, bullying by physically weak people often has a characteristic of grouping together. In the face of organized bullying, it makes no sense even if the person being bullied is physically stronger. For these people, the pleasure of subduing a physically strong person and crawling at their feet is unparalleled. Therefore, when a group of physically weak people get together and bully others in an organized manner, they often leave videos to record their so-called achievements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It should also be noted that violence by minors has nothing to do with gender. When the Datong incident caused unprecedented concern, Cai Yaqi, a real-name certified criminal law teacher, received a submission: a female classmate was bullied by other female classmates in the dormitory, and also had forced sex, and the perpetrator also took a video . Therefore, in cases of bullying of minors or even sexual bullying, do not rely on physical strength and gender. This will bias the understanding of the nature and causes of bullying, and lead to wrong prevention and response methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, bullying is a tool used to pursue a relationship of conquest and dominance. A newborn calf may not be inferior to a tiger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Adults may often have a limit to bullying due to the need for &quot;face&quot;, moral sense or &quot;fighting without breaking up&quot;; minors, due to their immature minds, do not have so many scruples. Once bullying is committed, There is often no lower limit, enough to frighten adults and make people feel like some children are born devils. The other side of &quot;newborn calves are not afraid of tigers&quot; is not so beautiful. The transition of minors from bullying to sexual bullying and sexual violence is a reflection of this internal logic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Any civilized society is to some extent based on sexual taboos and sexual shame. Even if modern society has broken some and relaxed some, it is difficult to change this fact. Taking the things that are most private and shameful to you, forcing you and humiliating you in public can break you mentally. The abuser has completed your mental discipline and achieved spiritual control over you. You become mentally a slave to your abuser. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above two points constitute the occurrence of minor bullying and even sexual bullying. On this basis, we can have some coping and prevention methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, specifically regarding the Datong campus incident, everyone noticed that the incident occurred in the school dormitory. It is very problematic for such a young child to live in school away from his parents. Of course, as the number of school closures decreases, the distribution of children will become increasingly sparse, resulting in an average distance for each child to go to school. At some stage, they may have to live on campus to save time commuting every day. However, if the child only goes to primary school, it is better to go to school nearby to ensure that the child goes home every day. Parents can also understand the child&#39;s situation and mental state at school, and any problems can be detected early. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, you must understand that the world of children is not innocent. Humans are social animals. In fixed interactions with two or more people in a stable environment with many people, there will inevitably be implicit or explicit hierarchical relationships, dominance and being dominated, or influencing and being influenced. relation. This cannot be eliminated. As long as it is based on the personality charm of the leader and the voluntary obedience of the followers, it is basically harmless. However, parents should pay attention to whether such relationships involve coercion and violence, and whether there is a qualitative change into a dominance-obedience relationship or a violence-victimization relationship. If such signs are discovered, they must intervene in time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether your child is a perpetrator or a victim, you should intervene and stop it. This is the approach of a decent and responsible parent. Never think that your child is the abuser and take advantage, then refuse to intervene, and then shirk responsibility and be irresponsible when other parents discover the problem. Children&#39;s behavior is likely to be shaped by the words and deeds of such parents and their subtle influence, which magnifies a family&#39;s educational failure into harm to other people and society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, the sex education our children need most urgently is anti-coercion, anti-rape, anti-sexual assault, and anti-obscenity education. This should be given to children before they enter kindergarten and primary school. Repeated reminders and education should help children establish the awareness that: my body is private and sacred and cannot be touched by just anyone; if someone tries to touch their body, they should stop and report it to their teachers and parents; I My personality and dignity cannot be insulted. I have the courage to defend my body, rights, personality and dignity, and dare to say no to all bullying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[朝鲜决定驱逐非法入境朝鲜的美国士兵]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257784]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-28 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/27/77abcf1d4d861baae180de4765d5b010.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;515&quot; height=&quot;417&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/09/27/77abcf1d4d861baae180de4765d5b010.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252490&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;US soldiers who illegally entered North Korea Travis King data map&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;CCTV News reported on September 27 that the Korean Central News Agency reported on the 27th that in response to the station incident that occurred in the Panmunjom Joint Security Area on July 18 The investigation into the illegal intrusion of Private Travis Kim of the South Korean U.S. Army into North Korea has been concluded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/f8fb158a6b64d55f388ee18ea338fcb7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;406&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/f8fb158a6b64d55f388ee18ea338fcb7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252491&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Panmunjom Joint Security Area&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reports stated that after investigation by relevant North Korean authorities, Telavi King confessed that he was disgusted with the inhuman abuse and racial discrimination within the US military, and was extremely disappointed with the unequal American society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reportedly, the relevant departments of North Korea decided to expel Travis Kim, an American soldier who illegally entered North Korea, in accordance with North Korean laws. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 13:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[求职大学生为拿offer将学历改为高中：民营雇主为何拒绝“大材小用”？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257746]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-28 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a job search news has attracted attention. According to &quot;Shangguan News&quot;, a newly graduated post-2000 college student said that he started looking for a job in early July, but he has never found a suitable job. Most of the jobs I wanted to take required work experience, and the hundreds of resumes I submitted came to nothing. He said that the requirements for the position are not high and the intensity is not high, and a monthly salary of 3,000 is acceptable. For this reason, he even thought about working in a factory as a general worker, but he could not find even this kind of job. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The college student involved admitted that this result made him feel &quot;a little embarrassed&quot;: after studying for so many years, he could not even find a job. In anger, he changed the highest education level on his resume to high school. Unexpectedly, when he opened the recruitment software the next day, there were dozens of greeting messages from HR. This news resonated with many netizens. Some netizens expressed their own opinions in their replies, saying that finding a job with a high school degree would make it easier to get a front-desk and promotion-type personnel/administrative job. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the situation of the person involved, he applied for these positions with a &quot;downward compatibility&quot; mentality. He is still looking for a job after graduating in early July, which means that he missed the autumn recruitment and spring recruitment in the past year, and had to turn to social recruitment, hoping to find a way out. However, it has been difficult for me to get out of the &quot;undergraduate position&quot; that I wanted. &quot;Hundreds of resumes have gone to waste&quot;, so I can only be &quot;downward compatible&quot;, &quot;even if I am a general worker in a factory, I can do it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, these more &quot;downward&quot; employers are unwilling to recruit candidates with undergraduate degrees. The college student in question was &quot;downward compatible&quot; with these positions with the mentality of &quot;acceptable&quot;, but the employer did not favor this undergraduate with a higher academic qualification. An HR person even expressed his own opinion in the Weibo comment area of ​​this news, saying that the unit he works for must first screen out the highly educated undergraduates who come to apply for jobs, and give priority to applicants whose highest education is high school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The college student in question applied for positions with “low requirements and low intensity” with a bachelor’s degree, but was repeatedly rejected. However, when he changed his highest degree to high school, he gained a lot of attention from HR. The question reflected in this news about &quot;voluntarily changing applicants with lower academic qualifications&quot; is why employers reject applicants with higher academic qualifications and better conditions on the grounds of &quot;overqualification&quot;. In fact, the employer&#39;s decision-making exactly reflects the laws of the market economy and does not violate the general principles of the job market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The job market itself is part of the market economy and follows the market mechanism. Employers pay wages to employees in exchange for their work contributions. The two follow the principle of voluntary reciprocal exchange. Both employers and employees must consider the cost-benefit ratio. For employers, the principle of recruiting employees is to &quot;find the most suitable person&quot; rather than &quot;finding the best person&quot;; for employees, the principle of finding a job is also to &quot;find the most suitable job&quot; rather than &quot;finding the best person&quot;. good job&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So in this news, the employer obviously does not think that the college student in question is the &quot;most suitable person&quot;, because the applicants from the high school with the highest education are qualified for the job, and the employer pays to hire them Comply with market transaction principles. Private enterprises pay more attention to &quot;cost-effectiveness&quot; and &quot;fitness&quot; when recruiting people. There is no way to &quot;win by relying on more&quot; based on academic qualifications alone. If recruiting applicants with undergraduate degrees, the employer will have to worry about other risks, such as higher salary requirements, whether the applicant will &quot;leave after a short period of time,&quot; and whether he or she will obey the rules. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The employer’s concerns are not unnecessary, because they are also in line with the thoughts of undergraduate candidates. It can be seen from the news that the college students involved chose to apply for these &quot;low-demand, low-intensity&quot; jobs with a &quot;downward compatibility&quot; mentality: This job is not the best, nor is it the most suitable. Yes, it’s just the jobs that can be found at the moment. It is a rational choice for employers to reject &quot;overqualification and underutilization&quot; based on their own interests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, &quot;backwards compatibility&quot; of candidates is not impossible. In addition to &quot;taking the initiative to apply for jobs with lower academic qualifications&quot;, it is also common to see in society that &quot;PhDs in nuclear physics from Peking University are admitted to the urban management establishment&quot;, &quot;Graduates from prestigious schools go to the street office&quot;, &quot;Masters and PhDs from prestigious universities gather for primary school teacher positions&quot;, etc. &quot;Real cases often trigger heated discussions in the public opinion field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the &quot;sinking positions&quot; in the front desk and promotion in the news, the positions such as &quot;urban management establishment&quot; and &quot;street office&quot; can hardly be called senior positions, but these positions have successfully attracted highly educated talents. One thing the positions have in common is that they are all in the public sector. The public sector does not need to consider the problem of &quot;a small temple cannot accommodate a big Buddha&quot; like the private sector. This is also confirmed by the news about public examinations that appear frequently in the public opinion field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, similar news also reminds that universities, parents and college students themselves should rethink the nature of higher education, avoid excessive investment that leads to negative output, and effectively improve their own position in the job market. Be competitive and find the job that suits you best. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[8月全国彩票销售增长53.6%，前八月增长51.6%]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257760]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-28 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/27/3043A223FCE084B67B9B9B585B9FCD1AA.JPEG &quot;Border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 862 &quot;height =&quot; 487 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/medias/image/2 3/09/27/3043A223FCE084B67B9B585B9FCD1AA. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252359&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;1.

In Pingshan Children&#39;s Park, stainless steel slides and swings are suitable for those aged 4 and above, while more complex balance beams and climbing nets require those aged 6 and above 12 years old respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despite the regulations, it cannot stop children under age. In a net-climbing project, if you are not tall enough, it will be difficult to climb up to the last climbing point. There are often children who are half-climbed and their hands and feet are weak and dare not continue, so they have to be carried down by their parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/ziFDpqTKiUXj6dva8kdTe4msE9ocnzFWrypOyi3w.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/ziFDpqTKiUXj6dva8kdTe4msE9ocnzFWrypOyi3w.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252543&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The net-climbing slide in Pingshan Children&#39;s Park is difficult for children with insufficient physical strength and height to climb up. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Song Bingchen/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Children&#39;s parks will also receive contradictory complaints from parents. On the one hand, they want their children to play More facilities mean more experiences; on the other hand, there are worries about safety. This contradiction is also a question that Liu Yuelai, associate professor at the School of Architecture and Urban Planning of Tongji University, has been thinking about - should we just encircle the railings and make them the safest? He feels that how children overcome dangers and difficulties also needs to be taken into consideration. Child-friendliness is more important than caring for and taking responsibility for children, creating conditions for children to experience, practice and grow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, adults often prevent children from stepping into puddles. If all puddles are eliminated, children will be bored. If some difficulties are designed, children can realize that they can overcome them, which is &quot;more important than adults eliminating all dangers.&quot; While ensuring safety, the water depth, slope, etc. comply with national regulations, which can enrich the park&#39;s landforms and provide more fun for children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the research, Nan Yishan also found that when it comes to snakes, children and parents are not curious, but afraid: there are no snakes in the park, right? Therefore, the commentary they designed begins with a child&#39;s voice saying: &quot;Snakes and humans have very deep misunderstandings about each other. When humans see snakes, they are nervous and afraid; when snakes see humans, they are frightened and frightened.&quot; This popularization of science focuses on how to communicate with snakes. What to do if you get along and get bitten by a snake. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Let&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;children participate in the construction of the park&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Few people know that the Nanyue King Museum is the former site of the Guangzhou Children&#39;s Park. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guangzhou Children’s Park was first built in 1958. During the expansion in 1995, cultural relics of the Nanyue King were unearthed and moved to the junction of Renmin South Road and Yide Road not far away. Later, Guangzhou Baiyun Airport was moved and built in 2014. In 2006, it moved to the old Baiyun Airport land. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This &quot;Brief History of the Park&quot; inspired artist Chen Zhou. He taught at the Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts and later focused on children&#39;s nature education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guangzhou Children&#39;s Park has an &quot;Art in the Park&quot; planning project. The purpose is not to hold an Internet celebrity exhibition, but to present the original intention, concept, process and results of children&#39;s art production. Chen Zhou took the children to visit the Nanyue Palace, imagining what the palace looked like more than two thousand years ago, and let the children build the kingdom in their hearts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The children found that the passages of the Nanyue Palace resembled an underground maze, so they designed passages using environmentally friendly materials to imitate the maze. Some passages can only be entered by children. Who is the King of South Vietnam and what does he look like? They thought they were ducks and birds, so they painted these patterns on the palaces they made. Some patterns even had the style of ancient house tiles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With multiple express boxes connected in series, the children built a time and space maze that connects the history and present of the children&#39;s park - the &quot;Growing Palace&quot;. After the palace was on display, Chen Zhou often received WeChat friend requests. Later, he discovered that a child posted his WeChat QR code on the palace. &quot;It was a child&#39;s prank. Some parents also added me and told me that the child was real.&quot; I really like this work.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/EzScAI2eA58ShksvdvX8CIxhUaCXBnHPTHgSs73O.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/EzScAI2eA58ShksvdvX8CIxhUaCXBnHPTHgSs73O.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252538&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;After visiting the Nanyue Palace, the children designed their own &quot;Growing Palace&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Song Bingchen/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The children&#39;s art exhibition attracted many professional artists to visit, and some hope to participate next year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child divides children&#39;s rights into three categories, one of which is the right to participate. However, according to the aforementioned UNICEF survey, only 26% of children said that the local government heard their voices. Opinion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Children&#39;s parks have a similar dilemma. The stereotype of children&#39;s parks is that they are cartoony and colorful, even the bathrooms are colorful. Liu Yuelai has a different opinion. Sometimes there are colors everywhere, which is stimulating to children. Color is important, but the most important thing is the color of nature. &quot;For example, by observing how the colors of butterflies and sunflowers change, and immersing yourself in them, children will become more friendly to nature.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the construction of children&#39;s parks, children have a say and can even become the protagonists. Liu Yuelai found that children in fourth grade and above already have a very strong willingness to assert themselves and express themselves, and they have relatively strong spatial modeling abilities. In the process of participating in the construction of children&#39;s parks, children change from consumers to producers. “This kind of self-organization with order and endogenous dynamics is also an important experiment in civic education.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As users of children&#39;s parks, how children play game facilities determines the functions of the facilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The aerial net bed in Pingshan Children&#39;s Park was originally used for children and parents to sit and relax, but children prefer to use it as a trampoline. At first, park managers advised everyone not to jump, but many people wanted to jump. After consulting the equipment manufacturer, moderate jumping is allowed on the premise of controlling the age and number of children and ensuring safety. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/a4U7H4gQyVegtGpOVo45wGZUctJ1cmroXTCSVHJk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height= &quot;951&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/a4U7H4gQyVegtGpOVo45wGZUctJ1cmroXTCSVHJk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252535&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Under the big banyan tree in Guangzhou Children&#39;s Park, the artist led the children to weave a &quot;Klein cocoon&quot; imitating the &quot;Klein bottle&quot; for everyone to hide and seek in it. The children Not only are they the creators of &quot;Klein&#39;s Cocoon&quot;, but they are also users. These works remain permanently in the park and become amusement facilities for children. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Song Bingchen/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The park has become&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;a part of life&lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The city is so big, where is the best place to “walk your baby”? This question bothers parents. Behind the increased importance of children&#39;s parks is the reduction of children&#39;s activity space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Houses in big cities are getting smaller, and even living rooms are getting smaller. “People don’t have much need to entertain guests, and children have even less space at home, so they can only go outside to play. .&quot; Wang Yafei observed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before coming to Shenzhen Pingshan Children&#39;s Park to work as an operator, Wang Yafei had been working in operations and management in residential and commercial institutions. After arriving at the Children&#39;s Park, his mentality was &quot;much younger.&quot; &quot;Children talk lively and cutely, which makes people feel relaxed. After being together for a long time, they feel a little childish.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many residential areas around Pingshan Children&#39;s Park. Some children have become regular visitors to the park and come to play in the park almost every day after school. Over time, Wang Yafei and them have also become friends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/FH0H73nDVXyLBmzgeslarsG4DpJiHqSKuCy1VCn2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/FH0H73nDVXyLBmzgeslarsG4DpJiHqSKuCy1VCn2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252536&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Pingshan Children’s Park Children’s Bookstore. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Song Bingchen/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Children will inevitably get bumped when playing in the park, and band-aids are always available in children&#39;s parks. At first, a box of 100 band-aids was enough for a month, but later it became less and less. At the fastest, it could be used up in half a month. Wang Yafei accidentally discovered that many children took away three or four band-aids at one time. Even when they were injured at home, the first thing they thought of was: There are band-aids in the park, so they went to the park to get them. Children&#39;s parks have become part of their lives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Expanding the supply of public services for children&quot; is exactly the requirement of the &quot;Guiding Opinions on Promoting the Construction of Child-Friendly Cities&quot; issued by 23 departments including the National Development and Reform Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Liu Yuelai found that the &quot;appearances&quot; of children&#39;s parks are becoming more and more similar. &quot;It&#39;s a bit like houses built by developers. The apartments are all of the same type. The equipment used is nothing more than stainless steel, aluminum alloy or other durable plastics. There is no local expression.&quot; For example, park facilities in the northwest can have local characteristics and train children. The balanced tree stump does not need to purchase the same industrial products in the product catalog, but uses local elm trees, which can not only save costs, but also reflect the local culture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Shenzhen Design Code&quot; also mentioned that plants should reflect the characteristics of Shenzhen. No less than 70% of the plants should be produced within 500 kilometers of the park and should be selected from plants with low maintenance, strong weather resistance, and resistance to pests and diseases. There are few native tree species, and an appropriate amount of exotic landscape tree species adapted to Shenzhen’s climate are selected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tailored for children, it avoids &quot;competition&quot; for resources among different user groups. There are almost no other adults in the children&#39;s park except parents. Deng Xiaofei, a master&#39;s tutor at the School of Architecture and Urban Planning of Guangzhou University, believes that Guangzhou will build special children&#39;s parks in various districts with clear and professional functions, clear target service groups, and can better meet the needs of children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But &quot;small&quot; and &quot;far away&quot; are the feedback Wang Yafei hears most from parents. The first phase of Pingshan Children&#39;s Park covers an area of ​​57,000 square meters, which is equivalent to 8 football fields, but it is only larger than the required area for a comprehensive park. Half of it is bigger. The small area will naturally make parents feel that their children are not having enough fun - an hour&#39;s drive from Futian is not enough to play. Why not drive 20 minutes more to the larger Huizhou Daya Bay Children&#39;s Park? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if Guangzhou has the largest cluster of children&#39;s parks, it is still not dense enough. Deng Xiaofei has done research on the children&#39;s park system in Guangzhou. If they only travel for half an hour, only a few people will be able to access children&#39;s park resources. Only if they travel for one hour can children&#39;s park resources cover the vast majority of children in Guangzhou. This is inconsistent with There is still a gap in Guangzhou’s three-level child-friendly living circle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Guangzhou Planning Guidelines for Building a Child-Friendly City&quot; proposes to build a child-friendly living circle that can reach the entire area within 30 minutes by public transportation; relying on streets and residential areas, build a child-friendly life that can be reached at street level within 15 minutes&#39; walk. circle; relying on residential communities, we will build a child-friendly living circle that can be reached within a 5-minute walk at the community level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deng Xiaofei suggested that Guangzhou could increase the number and area of ​​children&#39;s parks in densely populated old urban areas and northern fringe urban areas. For old cities with a shortage of space, you can consider using idle or inefficient land resources, such as abandoned factories, to rebuild or expand the original children&#39;s parks, and set up children&#39;s play facilities in existing parks, squares, streets and other public spaces. , create children’s activity venues, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first batch of Guangzhou&#39;s child-friendly series pilot lists released in August 2023, in addition to children&#39;s special parks, Liuhua Lake Park, Yuexiu Park, etc. were also selected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shenzhen also has similar ideas. The &quot;Shenzhen Action Plan for Building a Child-Friendly City (2021-2025)&quot; proposes to build more community parks and small-scale amusement parks, and expand sufficient children&#39;s game venues in city parks and community parks. By 2025, more than 100 child-friendly parks will be built. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 09:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
