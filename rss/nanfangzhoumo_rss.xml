Fabrice Hergot, Director of the Musée d&#39;Art Moderne de Paris ( Fabrice Hergott serves as the chief curator, selecting more than 60 representative works created by Zeng Fanzhi in the past 35 years, and presenting &quot;Looking Back at the Early Years&quot;, &quot;Different Paths&quot;, and &quot;Like Meditation&quot; in the high and spacious space of Pudong Art Museum. Four units, including &quot;Extra Large Scale&quot; and &quot;Extra Large Scale&quot;, encourage viewers to experience the secret of painting as a traditional art medium that continues to thrive today through more active and personal viewing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth mentioning that Zeng Fanzhi’s latest “Flickering Paintings” series makes its world debut in the exhibition. He has long since taken off his &quot;mask&quot;, turned decisively away from the various &quot;landscapes&quot; of the &quot;past&quot;, and devoted himself to a brand new experiment. Pointing to the largest work in the exhibition, &quot;Flickering Painting - Light III,&quot; Hergot said that this work reminded him of the grand atmosphere at the beginning of &quot;Genesis&quot; in the Bible. In this huge work of 480cm x 400cm, Zeng Fanzhi combined two oil canvases. The upper part depicts the magnificent scene of the sunrise with the clouds opening, and the lower part depicts the shimmering water surface reflected in the rays of sunlight. From a distance, it is a vast expanse of water. Elegant and bright pink and purple, a variety of rich and varied colors and textures can be observed up close. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/i2hjFeg022j8QSil2Jvw2WEi0TCFCbMeoSBoS4NF.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;959&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/i2hjFeg022j8QSil2Jvw2WEi0TCFCbMeoSBoS4NF.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253938&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Still Life, 2020, oil on canvas, 60 x 60 cm&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Fan Members of Zhi Studio had reminded the media that the artist would not comment on the new work in this interview. However, after the press conference and when he returned to the exhibition site, a timid girl finally summoned up the courage to ask a question that everyone was curious about. ——&quot;I personally feel that these new works resemble the style of Pointillism.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Zeng Fanzhi&#39;s own response to the new &quot;Flickering Paintings&quot; was not &quot;evasive&quot; at all. Like a teacher from an art academy who faces students, he sincerely &quot;teaches&quot; the girl: &quot;The Pointillist artist you are talking about was an artist 100 years ago. At that time, he used three primary colors. When he wanted to express one primary color, he used different blues. Together with the yellow dot, let you feel the green, but it is relatively simple. Our color changes are too advanced now!&quot; As he said, he walked in front of a piece of &quot;Flickering Painting - Dragon Heads Up I&quot;, showing a mysterious and proud look. The smile continued, &quot;Compared with the artists of that era, I used 40 colors to create 400 colors in this work. Pointillism is relatively simple. In the early days of modern art, everyone was looking for their own set of colors. In terms of language expression, there are probably not hundreds of colors to be found in the works at that time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the same exhibition hall of the &quot;Like Meditation&quot; unit, directly opposite the &quot;Dragon Heading Up&quot; with densely colored dots, It is a very contrasting, almost completely black &quot;Flickering Painting - Untitled&quot;. Zeng Fanzhi told me with a smile, &quot;This is really my first work in this new series, but others thought I was bragging. &quot;Compared with the complex brushstrokes, the color of this painting seems to be very pure. At first glance, it is a silent black. &quot;I particularly like this painting, but it does not use black from beginning to end.&quot; The creative process , Zeng Fanzhi combines three different shades of purple, a secret that can only be discovered when viewed up close under the right light. In order to confirm that it was deep purple, he led me to the &quot;Flickering Painting - Water VII&quot; next door, pointed to the edge of the intersection of &quot;black&quot; and white and said seriously, &quot;Look here, you can see that it is deep purple.&quot; .&quot; Because of the clear and straight dividing lines, the white waterfall on the picture appears as a solid shape in the dark background. Zeng Fanzhi said with a smile, &quot;Some of them even said, hey! What you painted is not a &#39;1&#39;?! I really don&#39;t know what to say.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a long period of partial practice, Zeng Fanzhi developed wonderful visual effects in the new series &quot;Flickering Paintings&quot;, &quot; Although color, composition and texture play their respective roles in every aspect of painting, in the medium of painting, they can never be separated from each other and become isolated existences.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, what he never forgets the most is The first moment when I successfully &quot;blacked out&quot; the picture with 3 shades of purple. Before leaving the exhibition hall, he stood next to the dark &quot;Untitled&quot; and suddenly discovered that under the influence of light, the picture took on a gray-green effect at a certain angle. Zeng Fanzhi took out his mobile phone to take a picture of its &quot;side face&quot; with great interest, and couldn&#39;t help but murmured excitedly, &quot;This &#39;like meditation&#39; should be called &#39;Niu B Space&#39;!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/FZ8FQPPOrcklj3F2o1XKD7kTHZYWnhrBQdBa26sw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;624&quot; data -src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/FZ8FQPPOrcklj3F2o1XKD7kTHZYWnhrBQdBa26sw.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253940&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Abstract Landscape - Night, 2005, oil on canvas, 215 x 330 cm&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>; Barefoot people wearing masks, shoeshine people at dusk&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The day before the exhibition opened, when crowds gathered to wait for the internal tour, Zeng Fanzhi was sitting cross-legged in a corner of the cafe, with his feet Wearing low-key sneakers, his indifferent expression is indeed in contrast to the high-spirited portrait in Liu Heung-cheng&#39;s photography exhibition upstairs. In 2012, Zeng Fanzhi tried on a pair of handmade leather shoes in a luxury store in London. The shoes were polished and polished. , he stood on tiptoe with his left foot, opened his suit with both hands, and was so happy that he almost flew up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the &quot;mask&quot; and the painting inside the painting, &quot;shoes&quot; are probably the most important annotations and metaphors for Zeng Fanzhi and his works. Portraits and still lifes run through his creations, and the 2009 sketch oil painting &quot;Boots&quot; is particularly special. This work was inspired by Van Gogh&#39;s 1886 work &quot;A Pair of Shoes&quot; and can be regarded as both a still life and a painting. Considered a portrait. When Zeng Fanzhi created &quot;Boots&quot;, it coincided with the explosive growth of Chinese contemporary art. The boots in the painting also represent the increasingly glamorous and glitzy life he faced. Zeng Fanzhi chose to take them off and examine them. While creating &quot;Boots&quot;, he also completed a self-portrait, in which he is holding a paintbrush, wearing a simple robe and bare feet. For a long time, the two works were hung side by side on the same wall within sight of his studio. Through this secret method, Zeng Fanzhi showed his confusion and determination for the future in his daily creations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the creation of the &quot;Mask&quot; series, the image of &quot;barefoot&quot; had already begun to emerge. Zeng Fanzhi moved to Beijing in 1993, and a year later the theme of the &quot;Mask Series&quot; emerged: he observed the crowds in big cities from the perspective of a bystander, expressing the contradiction between his individual consciousness and social identity. After the birth of this series, he began to attract attention from the international art world, and this thematic creation lasted for nearly 10 years. The &quot;Mask Series&quot; as a whole shows the trend of characters&#39; clothing becoming more and more exquisite and their facial expressions becoming increasingly blurred. However, &quot;Mask Series 1995 No. 14&quot; is a special case. The hands of the characters in the painting are exaggerated and enlarged, but the bare feet are still used. It is presented in normal proportions, so it appears top-heavy, with a certain humorous and self-deprecating temperament. The carefully dressed image forms a contradictory relationship with the naked feet, which also shows part of Zeng Fanzhi&#39;s life experience at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/HRVNziT5bJU84oTUlQD1TteDUaGfsF8bdxIRs3zY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;832&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/HRVNziT5bJU84oTUlQD1TteDUaGfsF8bdxIRs3zY.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253941&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Mask Series 1995 No. 7, 1995, oil on canvas, 150 x 130 cm&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Looking back at the early days&quot;, Zeng Fanzhi specifically mentioned two &quot;Twilight&quot; films: &quot;Twilight&quot; in 1989 and &quot;Twilight II&quot; in 1993. In the late 1980s, he studied in the Oil Painting Department of Hubei Academy of Fine Arts. At that time, he had received a series of technical training from the academy, but he was a disobedient student. &quot;&quot;Twilight&quot; in 1989 was a very important early work of mine. Because of the academic education back then, students had to go to the countryside or Tibet or the Loess Plateau every year to experience life and paint those local style paintings. But at that time, I worked with the school&#39;s I have a different idea. I said that my life is around me and I must paint places I am familiar with. I don’t go to those places in northern Shaanxi and spend two weeks painting people herding sheep. This painting is the one I pass by after school every day. Scene: A group of people are preparing to shine someone&#39;s shoes on the street. When someone comes, they sit on this chair to shine their shoes. Usually they sit here bored. To me, this scene is very interesting and touches me, so I made a sketch for them at the time, then went back and quickly completed the painting based on my feeling.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Four years later, Zeng Fanzhi created &quot;Twilight II&quot; in Beijing. The old title is used in the structure, and it also depicts the streets of Wuhan in the evening. &quot;Dusk&quot; is a real-life sketch, while &quot;Twilight 2&quot; is a new composition that combines the scenes in his memory with the characters around him. The smoke on the ground on the left , glass ballast, etc. were all extracted from the fireworks and the corners of the streets of Wuhan at that time. In this way, memory fragments from his growing experience continued to flash in Zeng Fanzhi’s future creations. Even in his subsequent abstract works, sometimes he There will also be characters from legends or old movies hidden deep within the intricate lines, and they will be imagined and portrayed in a rather subjective way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/XfSsH3lKZSdGcidFVCoqHIanDhmYP9eSWZ1JPdhV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;863&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/XfSsH3lKZSdGcidFVCoqHIanDhmYP9eSWZ1JPdhV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253942&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Dusk II, 1993, oil on canvas, 180 x 200 cm&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong>;Laughing red, melancholy green, a portrait of Freud&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2004, Zeng Fanzhi officially bid farewell to &quot;Portrait&quot; with a painting of a toy wooden horse. Mask Series&quot;. This masterpiece is often regarded as his self-portrait. The mask on the figure&#39;s face has been removed, but his expression is dull and unfathomable: he is no longer classified as an &quot;urban group&quot; of that era, but is regarded as a unique individual. Characterized by individuals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The projections of the characters and the wooden horse in different directions in &quot;Portrait&quot; create a weird and innocent atmosphere; his red coat forms a strong contrast with the green dotted on the corners of his clothes and the wooden horse&#39;s skateboard. Looking back at the &quot;past&quot;, large areas of red and a few strokes of emotional green have appeared repeatedly in Zeng Fanzhi&#39;s creations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/foJlx89PCRI51ElRK5MML0pMkeFJXZRSskKDRmfC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;959&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/foJlx89PCRI51ElRK5MML0pMkeFJXZRSskKDRmfC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253943&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Abstract Landscape - Huang, 2021, oil on canvas, 400 x 400 cm (double) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;The first abstract work to be shown in this exhibition, &quot;Cow Dance II&quot; (1988), is covered with large areas of thick red paint. In order to create this work, Zeng Fanzhi spent a lot of time Lots of oil paint. According to his recollection, many classmates laughed at him for being wasteful at that time, but he remained unmoved and insisted that only enough materials can ensure a real touch, and touch can drive inspiration. He firmly believed that only through constant hands-on practice, To find the direction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The background of &quot;Laughing Benin&quot; (1989) is a large area of ​​intense red, and the characters in &quot;The Melancholy Man&quot; (1990) wear sad green pants... These are all examples of Zeng Fanzhi&#39;s exploration of color expression. ’s first creations. &quot;&quot;Melancholy Man&quot; is a work I painted with my classmate Zhou Ning as the model. I was very satisfied at the time and I was very moved. From this painting, I realized how to use colors and lines to express emotions. The painting speed was very fast and I was very excited, including the look in his eyes, which allowed me to be integrated with the work when expressing it. Before, we drew a model randomly and had nothing to do with the model, but this work can integrate my own feelings into the painting. This It is a particularly important beginning in my portraiture.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/b2vV00PfuKiBh59Es1uK6V7WViF7oHn2z0nwbJcb.jpg&quot; border =&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/b2vV00PfuKiBh59Es1uK6V7WViF7oHn2z0nwbJcb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253944&quot; >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Part of the flickering painting series__2023 Zeng Fanzhi &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;Zhou Ning was also the model for &quot;Laughing Beckning&quot;. The title of that work uniquely combined the names of Zhou Ning and Max Beckmann, a German expressionist painter who had a profound influence on Zeng Fanzhi at the time. . Zhou Ning was the most frequently invited painting model by Zeng Fanzhi at that time. It was not easy to maintain one posture for a long time. In order to appease the models, Zeng Fanzhi would prepare small gifts from time to time. He still remembers that in order to complete &quot;The Melancholy Man&quot;, he reluctantly gave a box of lunch meat to Zhou Ning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/5aqsrnpy1QRbYD4ORt97Mb5EbHwyzTDC39NbMVPD.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;722&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/5aqsrnpy1QRbYD4ORt97Mb5EbHwyzTDC39NbMVPD.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253945&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Portrait, 2004, oil on canvas, 200 x 150 cm&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong >;&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When creating &quot;The Melancholy Man&quot;, Zeng Fanzhi used a spatula extensively to present concrete shapes with abstract brushstrokes to capture the inner feelings of the characters. Emotions and compositions are both narrative and situational, yet extremely restrained. These techniques continued into his future portrait creations. After the mid-middle period, many of Zeng Fanzhi&#39;s portraits were completed with a scraper, and all the backgrounds of the characters were hidden by leaving blank spaces. In works such as &quot;Hugo&quot; (2018), an upward scratch is left on the top of the character&#39;s head to hide the brush strokes of the oil painting, while showing a certain dynamic and making the character&#39;s expression more &quot;freehand&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“When I create portraits, I definitely paint people I like and people I know well. Hugo was an old photo I accidentally found. I felt very excited when I saw it. He was sitting there. There, the eyes caught my attention, so interesting! Many people think that I look at my hands first when painting, but in fact, from the moment his eyes made contact with me, I felt that this would definitely make a good portrait.&quot; Zeng Fan Zhi revealed to me, &quot;When painting eyes and faces, I have to do it in one stroke. The first 60% of this is accidental. When the color rolls inside, you have to predict what changes will happen inside with one stroke. It depends on some luck. , there is also an element of control, you must be very fast when scraping up, and it will be scraped up with just one stroke of the knife.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/10/12/w1quOl9L586bY8x4o3c0NC4NxzBpSFgFHIOoGt0k.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;785&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/ w1quOl9L586bY8x4o3c0NC4NxzBpSFgFHIOoGt0k.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253946&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Melancholic Man, 1990, oil on canvas, 110 x 90 cm&lt; span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Opposite the &quot;angry&quot; &quot;Hugo&quot;, the artist Lucian Freud&#39;s eyes were slightly blurred in Zeng Fanzhi&#39;s 2017 creation. The image of being closed and lying on a bed attracted everyone&#39;s attention. &quot;Speaking of Freud, I first saw his works in the library when I was in college. My first impression was also about the eyes. There were very complex emotions in the eyes he painted. It is difficult to express a person&#39;s emotions in painting. His eyes were very interesting and inspired me a lot. Later, when I painted, I also paid great attention to people’s eyes.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Freud has always been Zeng Fanzhi’s idol, and he especially admired him. The artist has strong creative power after middle age and a strong character that is not disturbed by the outside world. When I mentioned, &quot;Compared with the seated portrait in 2011, how different my mood was when I created this work on his deathbed in 2017&quot;, Zeng Fanzhi said frankly that the many portraits he created of Freud were actually They all reflect his inner projection of ideals at different stages. &quot;When I look at Freud&#39;s works, I pay great attention to the time of his creation. Then I always want to compare it with my own age. How old was he when he painted this painting? How old is he when I study it now? When I see exhibitions, I like to compare it with my own age. Let others compare, because I am also an artist. I think Freud is great. His seventies were actually the peak of his creation. His previous works were also very good, but his paintings were very tight and his eyes were very large. But the luster is a little different from that in his later years. He was a bit neurotic in his early years, but his creations in his later years, including the size and volume of his works, are all very good. I have seen many large-scale exhibitions of Freud, and he is someone I particularly admire. An artist who is 70 or 80 years old can still draw from life so well! You know, life drawing is challenging for artists.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/23/10/12/z43zVFskPkY4JcscNieL7HEofT7HnKoHquYeQKgn.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;805&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/10/12/z43zVFskPkY4JcscNieL7HEofT7HnKoHquYeQKgn.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253947&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Flicker Painting - Light III, 2019-2023 , oil on canvas, 480 x 400 cm (diptych) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Fanzhi was told of the opportunity to meet Freud I was very excited about this, but unfortunately, the news of Floyd&#39;s death came not long after. This work created in 2017 was inspired by a photo of Freud in his later years, but Zeng Fanzhi highly refined and recreated it: the whole painting is filled with a sense of ethereal loneliness, and Freud’s white robe and His whole body is filled with a strange halo, and the bed he lies on only retains a few hasty outlines, showing an unfinished state... This is the last painting Zeng Fanzhi paid tribute to Freud.

In April this year, Han Ting dived to a depth of 277 meters in Jiudun Skylight, once again breaking the Asian record for deepest cave diving, only 9 meters away from the world record of 286 meters. “The days are long,” Han Ting once described his experience of “just missing” the world record. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jiudun Skylight is what explorers call &quot;China&#39;s Underwater Everest&quot;. Du Lei, Han Ting&#39;s friend and director of the China Exploration Association, described to Nandu and N video reporters that Jiudun Skylight is like Han Ting&#39;s &quot;home&quot;. In recent years, he has continued to conduct underwater cave exploration and diving teaching here, and has participated in underwater rescues many times. Only this time, Han Ting lost contact with the outside world here and was found more than a hundred meters underwater many days later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After learning the news, Du Lei sent a sentence to the Nandu reporter: &quot;Which explorer can enjoy such an ending while fleeting in pursuit of his dream.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt; strong>;Diving Flash&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At about 17:00 on October 7, Lin Zhu (pseudonym), who was playing in Jiudun Skylight, photographed Han Ting in the water. He was wearing a black diving suit, holding a breathing regulator on his chest, and was talking to his friends on the shore. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Soon after, Han Ting lost contact. The dark waters swallowed up Han Ting&#39;s trace, and the people on the shore were anxious. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Villager Wang Na (pseudonym) was very surprised that Han Ting lost contact - on the 7th, she saw Han Ting at the skylight in Jiudun. &quot;He comes here often, dressed professionally, and looks just like usual.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Ren, who is also in the diving industry, learned the news that his old friend had lost contact. He told Nandu reporters that Han Ting originally planned to hit the 300-meter cave diving record on the 12th and conduct a live broadcast on the Internet. He has been making preparations in the past few days. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Talking about the difficulties in search and rescue, Mr. Ren analyzed to Nandu reporters that the Jiudun skylight environment is relatively closed and the space is small. In addition, the underwater environment is dark and full of rocks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/d35f2518e35fc5f993bacfa3808db293.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;427&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/d35f2518e35fc5f993bacfa3808db293.png&quot; data-key=&quot;253875&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Overlooking the Jiudun skylight.

I went diving in Zhenjiudun Skylight and still didn’t land until 11am on the 8th. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident, the emergency, public security, health and health departments of the autonomous region, Hechi City, autonomous county and Daxing Town rushed to the scene in a timely manner to carry out emergency response. On the 9th, the professional rescue team of Hangzhou Blue Flag Diving International Club rushed to the incident site to carry out search and rescue work. On the 10th, the Du&#39;an County emergency department contacted a domestic professional underwater intelligent robot service company to go to Du&#39;an to participate in the search and rescue. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 11, the Blue Flag International Diving Club founded by Han Ting issued a statement saying that since the evening of the 7th, diver Han Ting had been missing for more than three days. Because the cave where the accident occurred was too deep, he The rescue cannot be fully launched, and there is currently no significant progress in the search and rescue work. Thank you for your concern. You can follow the official announcement for details. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later the same day, Nandu reporters learned from multiple insiders that Han Ting was found more than 100 meters underwater in Jiudun Skylight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For extreme sports enthusiasts, death is not an untouchable topic. Du Lei recalled to Nandu reporters that Han Ting had discussed with him before that if his life ended, he hoped to stay in his favorite place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After learning that Han Ting was found underwater, Du Lei sent a message to the Nandu reporter: &quot;Which explorer can enjoy such an ending if he flashes away on the way to pursue his dream.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Underwater Everest&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In Du Lei’s view, Jiudun Skylight is like Han Ting’s “home”. In recent years, he has often dived and taught here. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jiudun Skylight is located around Jiudun Village, Jiudun Village, at the foot of a mountain peak on the edge of Jiudun Poli Valley. The clear bottomed jelly water here maintains a water temperature of 19°C all year round and sparkles under the sunlight. Since the Chengjiang River is covered with white seaweed flowers every spring and summer, tourists who come here to play say that &quot;this is a flowering river.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ms. Wei, who has visited this place before, told Nandu reporters that most of the tourists visiting the area are parents, children and young people. “It is indeed beautiful. Seaweed flowers grow underwater, with long rhizomes and many flowers. , very spectacular”, but “the surrounding environment is relatively primitive and I didn’t see any staff.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is understood that admission to the scenic spot is free. Visitors can experience swimming, paddleboarding, diving and other projects here. Paddleboards need to be rented. Ms. Wei said that there were more people playing paddleboards, but she also saw a few tourists wearing professional clothing preparing to dive on the shore. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/6f887e4d453b8e3203b9514163e4c4d2.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/6f887e4d453b8e3203b9514163e4c4d2.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253874&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Tourists play at Jiudun Skylight.

The Jiudun overflow skylight group consists of four inclined well-type skylights. Its deepest point has not yet been discovered and is known as the &quot;China&#39;s Underwater Everest&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2015, the Australian wet mule expedition team came here and spent more than 7 hours diving to a depth of 212 meters. However, they still did not find the bottom of Jiudun Skylight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Du Lei told Nandu reporters that the reason why Han Ting chose to break the Asian record and hit the world record in Jiudun Skylight is because it is deeper, more vertical, easier to dive and has better water quality than other caves. . &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He once went into the water here with Han Ting. He said that the water at a depth of 7 to 9 meters in Jiudun Skylight is close to the twilight level, or even completely dark. When it dives to 14 to 15 meters, it is basically a completely dark environment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Du Lei introduced to Nandu reporters, “In the visible light environment, a variety of water plants of different heights and distinct layers are accompanied by groups of swimming fish, and divers seem to be swimming in a landscape fish tank. ”, and when diving deeper, “it’s like being in glass, the water has very good permeability and there are no impurities.” In addition, the rocks around the cave are very steep and vertically downward, &quot;making you feel that you can&#39;t see the bottom at a glance, and also attracting you to see what is below.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Li, a diving enthusiast, goes to Du&#39;an to dive once or twice every year. He has been to Jiudun, Tunbang, Peach Blossom Jellyfish and Sunroof. He told Nandu reporters that because he is not a local and does not fully understand the terrain, he is also worried about safety issues, so he dives with many people every time. “Everyone dives within the standards of their own diving level and looks after each other, which will reduce the number of dives.” Security risks&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Li also mentioned that there are warning signs underwater in Jiudun Skylight to remind diving enthusiasts not to enter the hole. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind the warning signs are frequent safety incidents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2014, Mr. Wang from the Shenzhen Underwater Exploration Club and his party of three went to the site to inspect and conduct diving expeditions. One of the divers failed to surface after entering the water. Diving experts found the missing person in a cave that dived to a depth of 51 meters. After inspection, it was confirmed that the missing person had lost his vital signs at the time. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2015, two Chinese divers dived in Jiudun Skylight, and one of them died. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, the bodies of divers Gong Ziwei and Dong Jie were discovered underwater in the skylight of Duan Jiudun World on October 6 and 2 respectively. It is worth mentioning that Han Ting also participated in the search and rescue work. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The man at the top of the tower&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the diving world, Han Ting has a resounding nickname-&quot;Old Cat&quot;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recreational diver Xiao Fei told Nandu reporters: &quot;Lao Mao belongs to the top of the pyramid in the diving world.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Hangzhou Diving Sports Association, Han Ting was born in In 1976, he obtained the PADI (International Professional Diving Training System) diver certificate in Thailand in 2014. He has been diving for 19 years and is the first recreational scuba, free diving and technical diving instructor in China. At the same time, he is also one of the founders of the Blue Flag Diving International Club. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2010, Han Ting began to learn cave diving exploration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;A cave may have never been entered by anyone for millions of years, and you don&#39;t know what will happen in the next second.&quot; In the CCTV documentary &quot;Extreme China Season 2&quot; in Du&#39;an, Guangxi, he He explained why he loves cave diving, &quot;The experiences or feelings in the cave will sometimes bring out your dark side. This is the process of understanding and dialogue with yourself.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Han Ting put the cave in Diving to the extreme, many records have been set: the air cave deep diving world record of 128 meters, the underwater cave Mnemo mapping depth world record of 202 meters, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April this year, he successfully dived to a depth of 277 meters in Jiudun Skylight, once again breaking the Asian record for deepest cave diving, only 9 meters away from the world record of 286 meters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nandu reporters learned from the China Adventure Association that Han Ting first got into diving just for fun. After developing his hobby into a profession, he felt that he had an extra responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2015, Han Ting opened the Duan Blue Flag Diving Club to cultivate more diving talents. In recent years, he has also carried out systematic exploration of underwater caves in Guangxi and is responsible for the preparation of Asia&#39;s first world-class cave diving training base in Du&#39;an. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/c3a20c313405d48ef5ef2dad4122d361.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;446&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/c3a20c313405d48ef5ef2dad4122d361.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253873&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Han Ting. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, he participated in the establishment of China&#39;s scientific research diving system and assisted in the implementation of scientific research on China&#39;s extreme underwater environment; he has been responsible for or participated in many special underwater filming and difficult filming for TV or movies. Develop and implement solutions; commit to promoting public safety diving training and conducting firefighting and rescue training in diving. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, Han Ting participated in the exploration and salvage of the skeletons of Red Army Long March martyrs in Jiuhaijing, Guangxi, bringing to light the Red Army soldiers who had been sleeping underwater for 83 years. In 2020, he participated in the salvage work of the peach blossom jellyfish skylight accident in Du&#39;an, Guangxi, diving to 143 meters to complete the search and salvage of the remains of the victims. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The documentary &quot;Extreme China Season 2&quot; mentioned that cave diving is considered one of the most dangerous sports in the world, and even the most experienced divers will hang on by a thread. The China Exploration Association also mentioned in an article that cave diving accidents often occur in &quot;wild diving&quot; activities that are irregular and lack supervision. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Han Ting was deeply touched by this: &quot;It shouldn&#39;t be like this. I hope I can do something down-to-earth to make everyone realize the right way to go and what the right attitude should be. At least it can influence a few more people.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;There is a long way to go&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the view of his friend Du Lei, Han Ting, as the Asian cave diving record holder, has In the process of constantly breaking through ourselves, we have never broken through the safety bottom line. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“If it were me, with good feeling and good equipment, could I resist the urge to continue diving like him?” Talking about the fact that in April this year, Han Ting was only 9 meters away. Du Lei couldn&#39;t help but sigh with emotion about breaking the world record for cave diving. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared to the calm Han Ting, Du Lei felt that he had a little &quot;recklessness&quot; in him. Han Ting once reminded him repeatedly: &quot;During the exploration process, never set a &#39;hump&#39; for yourself that must be reached, as this will cause particularly large safety risks.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot; https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/3cc9adcdb873b540b2178328da56819c.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;980&quot; data -src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/3cc9adcdb873b540b2178328da56819c.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253872&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Jiudun Skylight Dive Route Map. Image source: China Exploration Association&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There is a long way to go&quot;, Han Ting once described his experience of &quot;missing the world record&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He once said publicly, &quot;The depth of this plan is 270 to 290 meters. When I arrived at the planned area, I hesitated for 1 second. It only took 1 more minute to break the world record. However, I am now very I am happy that I resisted the temptation and stopped diving, tied knots, put arrow marks, and ascended as planned. There is a long way to go.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Han Ting&#39;s high degree of control over safety is also reflected in the choice of diving equipment. . Du Lei once asked Han Ting for advice on how to choose a CCR, and Han Ting recommended to him a device with two working systems. &quot;It&#39;s equivalent to two engines in one machine. If one of them breaks down, the other one can be used.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Du Lei told Nandu reporters that in daily activities in the water, Han Ting often carries two sets of engines. CCR. &quot;It&#39;s equivalent to him holding four safety backups, which is a big inspiration to me.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April this year, Han Ting used a double-sided CCR three-way hybrid when he broke the Asian record. gas technology. According to the China Diving and Salvage Industry Association, CCR is a breathing circulation loop system that allows gas to continuously circulate in one direction in the loop. Diving with CCR can significantly reduce gas waste and greatly extend the underwater residence time, giving divers sufficient time to complete underwater exploration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, CCR also has disadvantages such as complex use and low operational fault tolerance. Du Lei analyzed that Han Ting&#39;s accident was most likely due to equipment problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Du Lei explained to Nandu reporters that in the process of continuous diving, divers need to adjust the proportion of inhaled gas according to pressure changes. But with a CCR, if the oxygen ratio decreases, the diver may not immediately notice it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Individuals may feel suffocated because the concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood is too high. However, CCR&#39;s carbon dioxide adsorbent will absorb all the carbon dioxide in the respiratory gas and will not cause people to feel suffocated.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once the oxygen supply equipment fails and the individual cannot feel the lack of oxygen, they may lose consciousness in an instant. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is currently unknown what happened when Han Ting lost contact underwater. But the departure of the &quot;man at the top&quot; does not mean that &quot;the building will collapse.&quot; On the road of adventure, brave men are still going forward. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I hope that people who are keen on exploration can learn from Han Ting’s research spirit and conduct exploration in a scientific way instead of blindly advancing. Only in this way can the entire industry become healthier.” Du Ray said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 13 Oct 2023 11:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[听吴熊和老师讲唐宋诗词]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258309]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-13 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Wu Xionghe’s lecture on Tang and Song poems made all our classmates straighten their chests and hold their breath.

The strong arm strength makes the friction of writing continue to increase, leaving a thick chalk mark. When it can&#39;t even scratch the mark, the chalk jumps up and hits hard, etching out a few pink spots. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The structure of the word is square, and between the lines of grass, endless power is compressed, as if it wants to burst out, but it is somewhat rounded by the invisible breath, just like the stature of Teacher Wu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/N6Dw6SQVkC98R9bhkx4WMfmOj1HsIC6N7YrJqcvN.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;658&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/N6Dw6SQVkC98R9bhkx4WMfmOj1HsIC6N7YrJqcvN.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253486&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wu Xionghe (1934-2012), a native of Shanghai, has long taught in the Chinese Department of Hangzhou University (later merged into Zhejiang University). He studied under Mr. Xia Chengtao, a great poet of the generation, and made remarkable achievements in the study of poetry in the Tang and Song Dynasties. The representative work &quot;General Theory of Ci of Tang and Song Dynasties&quot; is a self-contained monograph on Ci, with innovations and breakthroughs in theory, method and specific textual research. His class is the favorite of students in the Chinese Department. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the author)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teacher Wu’s voice was soothing and low at first, with a strong Wu sound. , as if swirling in a huge speaker, like still water flowing deep. As the content of the poem unfolds, the sound also spreads. Teacher Wu gradually immersed himself in it, speaking softly, flowing slowly, and then rushing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;His sentences are not long, and his words are two words, two words, four words, four words, then five words, then seven words, the sound becomes slow and urgent, the rhythm goes from slow to fast, until The long, high-pitched sentence came to an abrupt end. Pause - as if the world had stopped. Just when you thought you had forgotten the words, it started flowing slowly again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It turned out that it was because his heart was racing and he couldn&#39;t help himself. He had to suppress it for a while before restarting and moving forward. Only then did I realize that at that time, he was holding chalk in his right hand, tapping with his left hand, and looking steadily ahead. What he was looking at was not the classmates or tables and chairs in front of him, but as if through another time and space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teacher Wu usually recites poems first and then explains them line by line. The original text of the poem was like a condensed starting point, and his explanation opened up a whole world. Using his language to stir up the verses is like magic. Those words in twos and threes flow into our minds one after another, and we unfold pictures in our minds. Our eyes turn into lenses, words turn into portraits, we see scenes from far to near, close-ups with subtle observations, and the editing and combination of different shots... let us and the poet&#39;s heartbeat fall into the same rhythm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In that poem, one word is an image, and two words form a scene; two words plus a verb form a scene; a group of images plus a group of images form another scene. Several realms are superimposed to form one realm. The decomposed shots are connected naturally, skillfully and strangely to form a complete world of work, which is the &quot;artistic conception&quot; of the poem, as if you are immersed in the scene and within reach. If it is a &quot;state without me&quot;, everything is silent, and I and the state are one; if it is a &quot;land with me&quot;, then I can&#39;t help but worry about disturbing the heavenly beings in that state. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just like the two sentences &quot;The bright moon shines among the pines, and the clear spring rocks flow up&quot;, let us also transform into Wang Wei&#39;s perspective, travel through the past, and see the real world in Mojie&#39;s eyes, not the imaginary world. The world; it’s not, it’s the world he edited with his lens, the beauty he discovered. Beauty is the result of the poet&#39;s discovery and choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have long forgotten Teacher Wu’s detailed explanation.

A doctor said on Weibo: &quot;A child during consultation was swimming in a reservoir and was infected with cerebral amoeba. The brain tissue has softened, and the family is unwilling to give up. The friend who swam with the child was fine, but he was infected. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Amoeba is a kind of microorganism. Due to different living environments, it can be divided into entamoeba and free-living amoeba. The former is parasitic on humans and animals, and the latter lives in water and In the soil, it occasionally invades animal bodies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many types of amoeba, which can cause dysentery and liver abscesses, meningoencephalitis, keratitis, oral infections and skin lesions. Encephalitis is caused by the amoeba Naegleria. Naegleria-containing amoeba prefers hot and humid environments, and is commonly found in warm water environments above 25°C. Its fecundity is strongest at about 42°C. In nature, they are found in rivers, ponds, puddles and other water bodies, and they may also be found in hot springs and moist soil. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When a person swims in rivers, lakes or washes his nose with infected water, Naegleria enters the nasal cavity. After proliferating, it passes through the nasal mucosa and cribriform plate, travels up the olfactory nerve, enters the brain, and invades Central nervous system, causing primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Brain tissue is the best place for amoeba to survive. It is rich in phospholipids and has a suitable temperature. Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis has a short incubation period, usually only 3 to 5 days, and a maximum of 7 to 15 days. The onset is sudden and the disease progresses rapidly. Early symptoms of infection include: headache, fever, nausea and vomiting, and neck stiffness; late symptoms include: dizziness, loss of balance, epileptic seizures, abnormal taste and smell, and hallucinations, followed by rapid transition to delirium, paralysis, and coma. Patients often die from brain infection, swelling, and brain function cessation caused by a sudden increase in intracranial pressure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is still a lack of ideal drugs for the treatment of this disease. Amphotericin B and sulfonamides may have certain effects, but in general, infected people often only have three to seven days to live after symptoms appear, and they die from the infection. The rate can reach more than 95%. Because of this characteristic, this amoeba also has a terrifying name: brain-eating worm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This disease first &quot;appeared&quot; in Australia in 1965, and there are only a few hundred cases of infection worldwide. About half of the cases reported in the past occurred in the United States, and reports have also been reported in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium and other countries. According to the records of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in the past 53 years, there have been only 133 reports of amoeba infection in the United States. The mortality rate of such patients is high, and only 3 people have survived. In July 2015, a young woman in central California, USA, died from infection with the brain-eating amoeba amoeba. In 2015, 14-year-old track and field player Mike Riley in Houston, Texas, contracted the amoeba &quot;brain-eating worm&quot; after swimming in a lake and died a week later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first case in China occurred in Zhumadian area of ​​Henan Province in 1978 and was reported by Shanghai First Medical College in 1984. Since then, Beijing Friendship Hospital reported one case each in 1991 and 1996, one case was reported in Qiongzhong County, Hainan Province in 2003, and one case was reported in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province in 2006. None of the cases survived. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is alarming is that the doctor also said on Weibo: &quot;I have heard of several cases of cerebral amoeba infection this summer.&quot; A very rare disease broke out in one summer vacation. I have heard several times that it may reflect that primary amoebic meningoencephalitis is increasing. On October 7, 2020, the US &quot;Newsweek&quot; reported that &quot;brain-eating worms&quot; are migrating north across the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, purely based on risk, the risk of contracting &quot;brain-eating worms&quot; from wild swimming is currently very low, so don&#39;t scare yourself by taking advantage of it. However, we must pay attention to the serious consequences of infection and the trend that the probability of infection is increasing globally. The case this doctor came into contact with is an important warning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Until authoritative guidance comes out, the way to prevent infection with &quot;brain-eating worms&quot; is to avoid or minimize swimming in warm, unsterilized rivers, lakes, ponds, hot springs and other natural water bodies. , bathe, wash your face, if necessary, keep your head above the water or wear a nose clip, and be careful to avoid disturbing the sediment layer of lakes or ponds, because there may be a large number of amoeba living in it. If you have any suspicious symptoms such as headache, vomiting, abnormal sense of smell, or fever after swimming, you should seek medical attention immediately. The doctor also reminded on Weibo: Do ​​not swim in natural water bodies because there is a risk of drowning and infection. There is also a risk of infection with schistosomiasis and other parasites in southern rivers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Human beings are social animals, and the natural challenges faced by humans must rely on the power of civilized society to solve them. There is no problem swimming in sterilized tap water, which points to the problem of swimming pool construction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every summer vacation, schools always set strict rules, requiring students to stay away from rivers and lakes; various places also strictly guard against it and guard the water surfaces. However, China&#39;s swimming pool construction is still insufficient. Relevant statistics show that the per capita sports venue area in my country is 2.41 square meters, while according to estimates, the per capita sports venue area in rural my country is only 1.15 square meters, less than half of the national average. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, various places are also strengthening the construction of swimming pools to reduce the cost of using swimming pools. Hainan Province has opened swimming pools in primary schools for free during the summer. The relevant person in charge of the safety department of the province’s Department of Education said, “The free opening has further tightened the protective network to prevent student drowning. So far, the total number of student drowning accidents in Hainan Province this summer has been The number of drowning deaths has dropped significantly year-on-year.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The construction of swimming pools can be completely adapted to local conditions and does not necessarily have to be of high standards.
