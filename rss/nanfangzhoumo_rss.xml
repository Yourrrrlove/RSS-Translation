Moreover, if there are many people and there are many people, will there be a situation where &quot;the law does not punish everyone&quot;? How does the law identify those who play a major role in cyber violence? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon of September 25, 2023, the Supreme People&#39;s Court, the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate and the Ministry of Public Security jointly issued the &quot;Guiding Opinions on Punishing Illegal Crimes of Internet Violence in accordance with the Law&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Guiding Opinions&quot;), pointing out that cyber violence For illegal crimes, we must &quot;correct the erroneous tendency of &#39;the law does not punish the public&#39;&quot; and focus on cracking down on malicious initiators, organizers, malicious promoters and those who refuse to change despite repeated admonitions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The guidance is clear: when the targets are minors and disabled people; organize &quot;trolls&quot; and &quot;thugs&quot; to implement; fabricate &quot;sexually related&quot; topics; use generative AI technology to publish illegal information; If a network service provider initiates or organizes any of these five situations, cyberviolence perpetrators must be severely punished. According to Yao Jia, a professor at the Institute of Law of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, this represents the attitude towards controlling illegal and criminal acts of online violence. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Category of cyber violence for the first time&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Cyber ​​violence refers to the behavior of insulting others, spreading rumors and defamation, and invading privacy in cyberspace. It is not a legal concept, so when it comes to online violence, what are the crimes related to it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This issue is listed in the guidance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are three categories related to the perpetrators of cyber violence: creating and spreading rumors on the Internet, derogating others&#39; personalities and damaging others&#39; reputations. If the circumstances are serious, they will be convicted of defamation; those who resort to wanton abuse, malicious slander, and disclosure privacy and other methods, openly insulting others, and if the circumstances are serious, they will be convicted of the crime of insult; organizing &quot;human flesh searches&quot; to illegally collect and release citizens&#39; personal information to an unspecified majority of people, and if the circumstances are serious, they will be convicted of the crime of infringing on citizens&#39; personal information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, there are malicious marketing and hype behaviors carried out through cyber violence incidents, which are subject to the crime of illegal use of information networks; network service providers who do not act on the information discovered about cyber violence crimes may be liable to This constitutes the crime of refusing to perform information network security management obligations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Yao Jia&#39;s view, this guidance classifies online violence for the first time, &quot;at least it makes it a lot clearer&quot; and also emphasizes which behaviors may constitute crimes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, &quot;After the guidance is issued, cyber violence will certainly not be completely solved.&quot; Yao Jia believes that in practice, cyber violence incidents may involve the intersection of multiple behaviors, and judicial agencies, Law enforcement agencies should strengthen the identification of causal relationships and corresponding damage in cyber violence. In addition, the responsibilities of other social entities also need to be clarified. For example, when cyber violence occurs on campus, the school should also be an important player in participating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the guidance, the boundary between online violence and freedom of speech is also proposed: to report and expose other people’s crimes or violations of laws and disciplines through information networks, as long as they do not intentionally fabricate facts or knowingly If the facts are fabricated and spread intentionally, they should not be considered as defamation. Commenting and criticizing other people&#39;s words and deeds, even if the views are biased or the speech is extreme, as long as it is not wanton abuse or malicious slander, it should not be considered an insult or crime. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Clear standards for public prosecutions&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Criminal Law stipulates that, except for cases that seriously endanger social order and national interests, crimes of insult and defamation are “dealt with upon complaint.” crime. In other words, most of the time, this type of crime requires the victim to collect evidence to file a lawsuit in court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, among the 587 criminal defamation cases concluded by courts across the country, 271 cases, accounting for 46%, were not accepted, and only 79 cases were judged, accounting for less than 14%. Among them, only guilty verdicts were 43 people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a set of data provided by Zhou Jiahai, deputy director of the Supreme Law Research Office, at a press conference on the afternoon of September 25, 2023. He said that in recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of criminal cases involving insults and defamation, but the proportion of guilty verdicts is very low. Zhou Jiahai believes that this is due to the difficulty faced by private prosecutors in collecting evidence. On the other hand, it is also related to the lack of detailed guidance and &quot;too high a threshold&quot; for public prosecution standards in criminal cases of insult and defamation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The defamation case of a woman who picked up a courier in Hangzhou in July 2020 is a rare case that has been converted from private prosecution to public prosecution. It was listed as one of the top ten legal supervision cases of the year by the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As soon as Zheng Jingjing, the victim’s attorney, saw this guidance, she noticed the clauses detailing the circumstances of “seriously endangering social order” in the crime of insult and defamation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the situations is that &quot;the general public is arbitrarily targeted, and relevant information is widely disseminated on the Internet, triggering a large number of vulgar and malicious comments, seriously damaging the order of the Internet, and having a negative impact on society.&quot;—— This situation is almost completely consistent with the defamation case involving the courier woman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the press conference, Li Wenfeng, deputy director of the Legal Policy Research Office of the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, said in response to reporters&#39; questions that the guidance did draw lessons from the Hangzhou woman who was defamed while picking up express delivery when stipulating the prosecution standards for insult and defamation cases. case experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Jingjing recalled that when she represented the case, according to the judicial interpretation on the criminal offense of online defamation issued by the Supreme People&#39;s Court and the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate in 2013, more attention was paid to whether the determination of &quot;seriously endangering social order and national interests&quot; It may cause crises in real life, such as mass incidents, public disorder, etc. Finally, the court used the blanket clause of “other situations that seriously endanger social order and national interests” as the legal basis for transferring private prosecution to public prosecution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the release of the guidance, there are more detailed guidelines for the application of public prosecution procedures to crimes of online insult and defamation. In addition to the above-mentioned situation, there are three other specific situations that cause bad social impact: serious consequences such as mental disorder or suicide of the victim or his close relatives; insulting and slandering multiple people or spreading insulting and slanderous information multiple times; organizing and instigating Personnel spread a large amount of insulting and slanderous information on multiple online platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 19:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中秋节临近，广州的这条“灯笼街”充满中国人的节日浪漫]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257661]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[北京链家下调中介费率，买卖双方各担1%]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257679]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 17:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On September 26, the reporter learned from Lianjia that Beijing Lianjia had recently lowered the agency fee standard and changed the order form The side commission is transformed into a bilateral commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, the Beijing link agency fee standard has been uniformly reduced from 2.7% to 2% of the total housing transaction price. On the other hand, the charging model has been changed from the unilateral payment of the agency fee by the buyer to a joint payment by the buyer and seller, with each buyer and seller bearing 1%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, on April 27 this year, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development and the State Administration for Market Regulation jointly issued a document to regulate real estate brokerage services. The document clearly states that real estate brokerage institutions should reasonably reduce the brokerage service fees for housing sales and leasing, and guide both parties to the transaction to share the brokerage service fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, Beijing Lianjia stated that this adjustment to the intermediary fee standards is Lianjia’s response to market changes, responding to ministry documents, proactively adapting to changes, and achieving stable development of the enterprise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yujia, chief researcher of the Housing Policy Research Center of the Guangdong Provincial Institute of Urban Planning, said that under the guidance of the policy and combined with the current weak market trading sentiment, Beijing Lianjia has adjusted charging methods and standards, actively offered benefits to the market, and reduced Transaction costs boost market sentiment and confidence, which is a reflection of active response to national policy calls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yujia believes that Beijing Lianjia’s move will help reduce consumers’ home purchase costs, help expand the market size, better promote a virtuous cycle between new homes and second-hand homes, and promote the healthy and stable development of the real estate market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An intermediary from Beijing Lianjia told the 21st Century Business Herald reporter that on the basis of lowering the agency fee standards and adjusting the charging model, his store currently has additional intermediaries for chain single customers and regular customers. There is a fee discount, that is, serial customers who sell and buy houses on Lianjia can get a 10% discount, and customers who have bought or rented a house on Lianjia in the past year can get a 9.5% discount. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ms. Jiang is a serial customer of Lianjia who sells old and buys new ones. She has just paid the down payment and agency fee for her new house. After learning that Lianjia had reduced agency fees, she contacted the house purchase agency on the morning of September 26, hoping to apply for a reduction in the agency fees she had paid. In response, Lianjia Intermediary responded that if the intermediary fee is lowered, it can apply, but it has not yet received a clearer answer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ms. Jiang’s own house is still for sale and has not yet been sold. After Beijing Lianjia implements bilateral commission collection, she will also bear an agency fee of 1% of the total price. In this regard, she told the 21st Century Business Herald reporter that if the seller needs to pay an intermediary fee when selling the house, she will add the intermediary fee to the total house payment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ms. Jiang is not the only landlord who has similar ideas. Li Yujia said that theoretically, owners would have an incentive to pass on agency fees to housing prices, and this has also happened in the past. But whether it can be passed on, or how much it can be passed on, depends on the pricing of housing prices in the micro market. Second-hand housing is a highly decentralized and fully competitive market-oriented transaction. The market information is very transparent, and it is difficult to consider using information gaps. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yujia believes that the current market competition situation is completely different from the past. The number of second-hand house listings in various places has reached a record high. Selling old and buying new, selling small and buying big, and asset transfer are very common. In more cases, owners Reasonable pricing, or even lowering the listing price, in order to sell the house as quickly as possible will make it difficult for the seller to transfer the agency fees to the buyer. If the seller passes the costs onto the house price, it is likely to affect the transaction efficiency of the house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lianjia emphasized that Beijing Lianjia’s adjustment of intermediary rates is an independent adjustment by the company. As for whether other companies will follow suit, it is also the company’s independent market behavior. However, Lianjia is the leading intermediary institution in Beijing, and its adjustments will have a catalytic effect on other institutions and even the entire industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yujia said that in fact, in most second-hand housing transactions in the world, the intermediary fees are shared by both parties, or the seller pays all costs. With the changes in supply and demand in the real estate market, some property owners in many places across the country have begun to be willing to share agency fees to facilitate transactions. In cities such as Chengdu and Dalian, bilateral charging has been implemented for more than ten years. Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Chongqing and other cities have also implemented bilateral tolling in recent years. It can be seen that this model has become more and more accepted by everyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 17:55:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[徐悲鸿 欲倾东海洗乾坤丨那年今日]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257692]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[专访15岁亚运冠军陈烨：“不要放弃，多去尝试”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257675]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/26/n6BzmUN9Dh6lZmOCtTVLbE7rL6I5BEPM9zP1aG3o.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;648&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/n6BzmUN9Dh6lZmOCtTVLbE7rL6I5 BEPM9zP1aG3o. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252196&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 25, 2023, champion Chinese player Chen Ye (middle) and runner-up Japan Contestant Yuro Nagahara (left) and third runner-up Japanese player Kensuke Sasaoka spin and jump at the award ceremony &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; , take the board, fly... On the afternoon of September 25, 2023, at the Qiantang Roller Skating Center, after performing a series of wonderful skateboarding moves, the 15-year-old Guangdong teenager Chen Ye won the championship in the Hangzhou Asian Games Men&#39;s Skateboard Bowl Final. This is the first gold medal won by the Chinese team in the skateboarding world competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Ye is a high-profile rising star in skateboarding. He was born in 2008 and has been making a mark in national competitions since he was 12 years old. In the 2020 National Skateboarding Championships and the men&#39;s bowl pool event of the 2021 National Games, Chen Ye won second place; in the selection of the 2022 Hangzhou Asian Games Skateboarding National Training Team, Chen Ye was selected with first place . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the preliminaries on September 24, Chen Ye&#39;s competition state was to seek breakthroughs in stability, and advanced to the finals with fourth place in the preliminaries. After the game, Chen Ye said that he would give it all in the finals and perform the most difficult moves, &quot;try to get into the top four, or even the top three.&quot; Facing a field filled with experts, Chen Ye competed with a learning mentality. Didn&#39;t put too much pressure on myself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/JUNbfTebCRVb3G62S8AhCzeh1tcePOy7GmsOmyev.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/JUNbfTebCRVb3G62S8AhCzeh1tcePOy7GmsOmyev.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252192&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 25, 2023, Chen Ye in the finals&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the finals, Chen Ye continued to perform at a high level, breaking through the preliminaries in the first round, scoring 82.82 points, ranking first; in the second round, he set a new high score again, scoring 84.41 points, maintaining his advantage; In the last round, Chen Ye scored 80.62 points. Although it was not as good as the 84.00 points of Japanese player Yuro Nagahara in this round, he won the gold medal with the highest score of 84.41 points in the three rounds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the media interviews and press conferences after the game, Chen Ye repeatedly thanked one person, his father Chen Wanqin. On the road to the championship, his father always supported him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/rMtC7bLDYbb9LaCpTUv2iNfzZVqJ5DW4qOVv7X3W.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/rMtC7bLDYbb9LaCpTUv2iNfzZVqJ5DW4qOVv7X3W.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252197&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chen Ye (right) and his father Chen Wanqin&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Father and son&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Learning that he won the championship After the news, Chen Ye excitedly put on the national flag, slid around the bowl with a bright smile, and waved to the audience. &quot;I didn&#39;t really think about anything at the time. I was just very happy and very excited.&quot; At the post-match press conference, Chen Ye sat upright in front of the stage and answered reporters&#39; questions unhurriedly with a slightly hoarse voice during the voice change period, acting like a Shy boy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Ye emphatically thanked his father, &quot;He built two venues for me, thank him.&quot; Chen Ye only entered the national training team two months ago. Before that, he was his father. Chen Wanqin was guiding him. Skateboarding was only introduced to China at the end of the 20th century, and it was also relatively late to be listed as an Olympic sport. In 2016, the International Olympic Organizing Committee announced that skateboarding would be officially included in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Therefore, when Chen Ye first came into contact with skateboarding, there were almost no professional players and professional coaches in the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Ye fell in love with skateboarding by chance. On New Year&#39;s Day in 2016, Chen Wanqin took Chen Ye to the sports mall. Chen Ye tried out the skateboard and liked it very much. Chen Wanqin said, &quot;I will take you to play when you want to play.&quot; A month later, Chen Ye He went to play every day, and Chen Wanqin bought him a skateboard. When Chen Ye persisted in playing for half a year, Chen Wanqin made up his mind to make skateboarding Chen Ye&#39;s longer-term hobby. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with street skateboarding, Chen Ye prefers skating in bowls and pools. “It can fly higher and go faster.” When he first started practicing, Chen Wanqin took Chen Ye on the Internet Find videos of skaters on the internet and practice whatever moves you’re interested in. Chen Wanqin&#39;s experience in learning dance allowed him to break down complex movements one by one and arrange Chen Ye&#39;s training in an orderly manner. They practiced at a public skatepark in Zhongshan City. At that time, there were very few people skateboarding. Most of the time, only the father and son were practicing. In order to communicate with more skateboarders, they would go to Hong Kong and Tokyo during holidays. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2016, the International Olympic Committee voted to include skateboarding as an official event in the Tokyo Olympics. The mentality of father and son has quietly changed, from &quot;becoming a skateboard master&quot; to a more professional direction. It was also at this time that national skateboarding competitions began in China, and skateboarding was also included in the 2017 National Games. The first competition Chen Ye participated in was the 2018 &quot;U Series China Youth Skateboarding Tour&quot; and he won third place. They found that &quot;it turns out that if you practice like this, your skills are pretty good.&quot; Does that mean that as long as you work harder, you can achieve better results? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no professional bowl pool in Zhongshan City. The nearest bowl pool is in Guangzhou, which takes two hours from Zhongshan. In 2019, in order for Chen Ye to have a professional training venue near his home, Chen Wanqin made a bold decision to build his own bowl pool. Later in his self-report, Chen Wanqin said that he was afraid of failure before building the project. &quot;I was afraid that I would invest all the money and not be able to make it.&quot; He simulated it with 3D printing and then felt confident. &quot;At that time, I thought, just be I work for my dreams. If I fail, I will fail. Anyway, I don’t have much money saved.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Wanqin rented a warehouse of more than 200 square meters and about 4 meters high, and learned to saw wood. Start by building the structure of the bowl piece by piece. Half a year later, Wanchi was actually made. And Chen Ye lived up to his father&#39;s efforts, honing his movements and techniques to become increasingly sophisticated, and achieving a major breakthrough in Chinese skateboarding at the Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2023, Chen Wanqin built a larger and more comprehensive skatepark. While accompanying Chen Ye in training, he accumulated experience and became a professional skateboard coach to guide more skateboarders. Kids enjoy skateboarding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And Chen Ye will continue to challenge a broader arena. After winning the Asian Games, Chen Ye admitted that he had no hope of participating in the Paris Olympics because &quot;the current speed and height are still not enough&quot;, but he will try to &quot;fly higher and accelerate faster&quot; during training and go to more places. The venue is slippery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/cYC3ATrbphgccA0H997dau8HWkQcpgJ1fdk6TcEo.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1205&quot; height= &quot;855&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/cYC3ATrbphgccA0H997dau8HWkQcpgJ1fdk6TcEo.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252193&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chen Ye is studying&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Conversation with Chen Ye&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/p>; strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You said at the press conference, “When training, you should try to fly higher, accelerate faster, and overcome psychological obstacles. .&quot; So do you still feel scared when you skate? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Ye: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, if the speed (skating) is fast or very high, it is actually quite scary. When accelerating air (flying into the air), the faster the flying speed, the easier it is to shake and it is difficult to control. Should you jump in or out? It is also possible to jump very far and fall on the flat ground, which is a bit scary. It is necessary to accurately control the take-off position and landing position. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Then how do you overcome your fear? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Ye: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;If you are afraid, start with the short one first and increase the height little by little. There is no need to exaggerate all at once. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When you flew up, it was because you had no control Good wrestling? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Ye: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, especially when I am in a hurry, I think I will fly higher immediately. If I cannot control it well at this time, it is possible It dropped so low that it hit my knees and feet. Wrestling is very common. When you first start practicing each action, you must &quot;practice&quot; wrestling first. This will be safer, otherwise you may be seriously injured if you fall. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You initially followed the video training on the Internet , but complex movements still require on-site observation and learning.

I went to Tokyo to learn air, because at that time there were no professional bowl pools in China, and U-shaped pools were hard to come by. There was a 4-meter U-shaped pool in Tokyo, and there were many skateboarders, and you could watch their demonstrations. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/GHb00IUOhv75Pq0ynXy0pNvlyZJ9mQdU2j8gGtwx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 980&quot; height=&quot;1709&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/GHb00IUOhv75Pq0ynXy0pNvlyZJ9mQdU2j8gGtwx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252194&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chen Ye in daily training&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics , Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How long did it take you to practice to learn air? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Ye: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In the beginning, you grab the board to jump, and then you click on the board to jump. The most standard thing is to grab the board when you hit the pole. About half a year. There will definitely be boredom. It was okay when I was in Tokyo, there were more skaters practicing together, but there aren’t that many skaters back home. When the moves get boring, just change to another move. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You started skateboarding in 2016. When did you decide? Become a professional skateboarder? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Ye: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It should be before the National Games. In 2019, in order to prepare for the National Games, my father built a bowl pond for me. The two of us decided to build it together. Because I participated in several competitions at that time and watched the performance of foreign players, I felt that if you want better results, you still need to have a professional venue. After building a professional venue, I felt that I should practice skateboarding seriously and professionally. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Your father said before that he took it out All your savings were used to build the bowl pool. Did you make a lot of determination at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Ye: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;No. Anyway, my father still wanted to support me and saw that I had achieved some results, but he did not say that he had particularly high hopes. He mainly wanted me to continue to stick to this hobby and interest. He wouldn&#39;t put too much pressure on me, just let me perform well during the competition, and he didn&#39;t say I must win any awards. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I asked about the training team training and father&#39;s training in the afternoon When talking about the difference, you said the styles are different.

The scene is crowded with pregnant women and expectant mothers. Obstetricians say: In order to allow their children to go to school a year earlier, many expectant mothers who have not yet reached their due date have given birth to &quot;school babies&quot; through caesarean section, which has become a common phenomenon in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some parents say: You will know when you have children! One day late, one year delayed! Some pregnant women have just completed 37 weeks of pregnancy (the standard pregnancy period is 40 weeks, 38-42 weeks is considered normal) and the baby is removed through a laparotomy. Manual intervention can advance the baby&#39;s birthday to before September 1, so that the baby can go to school at the age of 6. Parents hope that their children will be one step ahead of other children at the &quot;starting line of life&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the fact is: there is no evidence that premature infants can win at the &quot;starting line of life&quot;. Premature infants have not been seen to have an advantage in any human group, at any historical stage, or in any field. Not only that, but premature babies have a greater chance of being born with physical and mental deficiencies. Not only do they lose at the &quot;starting line of life&quot;, but they are also likely to fall behind step by step in life, lose for the rest of their lives, and even suffer from lifelong illness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology&quot; pointed out: Newborns between 39 and 41 weeks are considered full-term babies. In the absence of external factors, full-term babies have the greatest probability of being healthier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Doctors generally advocate that caesarean section is not recommended unless it is difficult to deliver, and caesarean section is even more undesirable if the baby is less than three months old. Because any caesarean section carries risks for both the mother and the baby. There is a high probability that the child&#39;s lungs will not develop maturely, and premature babies are prone to accidents and stunted growth. For parturient women, performing a caesarean section before uterine contractions may result in incomplete uterine reduction and increase the risk of postpartum hemorrhage and infection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cesarean section when the baby is less than a month old or without signs of labor will also have varying degrees of psychological impact on the newborn. Child psychology research has found that children born by caesarean section have a significantly higher incidence of ADHD (ADHD) than children born naturally. They will develop symptoms of attention deficit, impulsivity, and hyperactivity later in life, which will affect learning and understanding for a long time (even lifelong). ability, while the situation of premature infants is even worse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Child psychologist Jean Piaget proposed the theory of &quot;stages of child development&quot;: at different ages, children&#39;s intellectual development grows gradually, and the order of each stage cannot be exceeded. Disruption, otherwise it will disrupt the normal development process of children&#39;s minds and even affect their adult personality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The old saying &quot;Children look the same every year&quot; is a simple summary of this objective natural law. Children aged 5, 6 and 7 are at different stages of psychological and intellectual development. Forcibly turning a child into a &quot;twisted melon&quot;, or even cutting it out of the mother&#39;s belly in advance, is &quot;stealing the seedlings&quot;, forcing the child to skip the normal development stage of life, forcing it to make a &quot;big leap forward in life&quot;, which not only affects the child&#39;s physical development It is unfavorable and will cause children under school age to be unable to keep up with their studies, resulting in low self-esteem and a dislike of learning. The outcome will most likely be counterproductive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The famous psychologist Gsell proved the &quot;maturity advantage theory&quot; through experimental data: through testing more than one hundred pairs of twins for many years, he found that regardless of race, gender, and regional differences, children with more mature development After training in a shorter period of time, you can get better learning results. It proves that a person&#39;s individual physical and mental maturity develops in an orderly and regular manner. Only when the individual matures, the learning effect will be better. Wait patiently, and when the time comes, the result will often be twice the result with half the effort in life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a private group discussing &quot;school-starting babies&quot;, some netizens said: I went to kindergarten or school when I was a little young, and I was not welcomed by the teacher because I couldn&#39;t keep up with the progress, and I felt quite hurt inside; Some netizens said: I have regretted for half my life that I had a caesarean section in order to catch up with school in September. Little did I know that my child has resumed high school. After all the effort, I have given back all the stolen years. I, my husband, and my child are exhausted and scarred both physically and mentally. Tired...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some educationists have proposed that not only should children be born by caesarean section so that they can go to school early, but even full-term children born normally should not learn too early, but should ensure that children have enough education in childhood and adolescence. Play time. Play is not &quot;abstaining from one&#39;s duties&quot;, but an important way and stage for the normal and complete development of various brain areas in human childhood, the formation of imagination and creativity, the cultivation of curiosity and exploration spirit, and the shaping of personality and character. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Forcing children to read, read, and recite ancient poems too early will not only enhance the memory areas of the brain, but also suppress the excitement and development of imagination, creativity, exploration, adventurous spirit and other areas. As a result, I had a caesarean section and worked hard for my children in early childhood education. The result of the struggle in the first half of my life was to be a clerk, being assessed on KPIs with trepidation, and calculating how much more would be deducted from my already limited salary each month. And those &quot;bad boys&quot; who have more comprehensive minds, stronger personalities, and are more daring to think, venture and do become bosses and leaders... Assess your children&#39;s KPIs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In foreign countries, the standards for children&#39;s admission are relatively flexible. Many countries specifically select children for admission based on their actual development. In France, New Zealand, Australia and other countries, if a child prodigy who develops early and quickly is found, the school entry age can even be advanced to 5 years old. The regulations in the United States are 5-7 years old, and prodigies can enter school at the age of 5. It is usually very difficult for children to enter school again at 7 years old. Normal; South Korea stipulates that children can enter school at the age of 6, but the average child is still 7 years old. If the child grows and develops later, the school age can be pushed back further. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In our country, as early as 2017, the Ministry of Education had relaxed its policies at the policy level: it no longer imposed a &quot;one size fits all&quot; mandatory age limit for enrollment before September 1. In Hubei, Henan, Anhui and other places, the enrollment age has also begun to be &quot;relaxed&quot;, and &quot;flexible enrollment&quot; has gradually been realized, and the reforms have gradually become more reasonable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As policies become more reasonable, people’s psychology must also keep up. They must treat themselves and their children’s lives more rationally, scientifically, objectively, and tolerantly, and view the world and life from a more modern and broader perspective. , don&#39;t make yourself and the child in your belly live too much. &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;财报显示，2023财年第二季度，其销售额同比增长18%至22.1亿美元（约合162亿元人民币，下同）。这当中，最引人注目的是中国市场——二季度lululemon中国市场的营收为2.77亿美元（约合20亿），同比增长61%。至此，今年上半年中国市场收入高达5.27亿美元（约合38.7亿），同比增长69%，成为全球增长最快的区域。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;lululemon主打中高端市场，一条瑜伽裤上千元，极少打折，被誉为瑜伽界的“爱马仕”，尽管社交媒体上，也有很多声音吐槽lululemon是收智商税的，lululemon的中国业绩仍然一路狂奔——lululemon为什么那么火爆？高增长背后又存在怎样的隐忧？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;销售业绩一路狂奔&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;lululemon是非常年轻的品牌，1998年在加拿大温哥华成立。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;创始人Chip Wilson在瑜伽课上看到很多练习瑜伽的人并没有合适的瑜伽服饰，很多人是穿棉质衣服或舞蹈服来上课，而这类材质的衣服并不适合热汗运动场景。 Chip Wilson抓住了这个市场需求，对市面上的瑜伽服饰的功能性不断进行改良，很快在当地做出了口碑和影响力。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;2000年，lululemon在温哥华开设第一家店。 2005年，lululemon得到资本投资，迅速扩张，2007年，lululemon在纽约纳斯达克和多伦多证券交易所同时上市。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;多年来，lululemon的销售额快速增长。 2004年到2018年，营收从4100万美元增长到33亿美元，2020年这个数字为44亿美元，2022财年更是卖出了62.57亿美元。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;17年前净利润还只有100多万美元，2022财年已经逼近10亿美元。 2022年7月份，lululemon市值达到374亿美元，超越Adidas，成为仅次于Nike的全球第二大运动品牌。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;lululemon的发展壮大，中国市场成为不可轻视的存在。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Lululemon在2013年正式进入中国市场，中国市场的增速最为亮眼。 lululemon今年第二季度财报显示，上一季度，中国市场的营收呈现惊人的高速增长：销售额同比增长79%，中国大陆市场三年复合增长率超过了50%。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;截至第二季度末，lululemon在全球拥有672家直营门店，其中有126家位于中国市场。根据lululemon的全球发展计划，到2026年时，品牌营收将比2021年增加一倍至125亿美元，中国大陆的门店数量将达220家，中国市场也将成为品牌全球第二大市场。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/dc3185eb107611c6a0b78fe41a77ba8b.jpeg&quot;

data-key=&quot;252096&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo &amp;nbsp;/ 图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;为什么这么贵却那么火&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;一条定价动辄上千的瑜伽裤，为什么能够卖爆？为什么市值能够在如此短的时间内，成为全球运动品牌里的第二？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;首先，找准赛道。 lululemon的成功，与它一开始敏锐地抓住瑜伽这个在当时相对小众的市场需求有关，形成了差异化竞争，避开与Nike、Adidas等巨头的正面博弈，成功实现弯道超车。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;其二，做到极致。 &lt;span>;哪怕对lululemon瑜伽裤的吐槽一直不少，也不得不承认，它能够在瑜伽裤市场上遥遥领先，确实是因为在长期且持续的研发投入后，lululemon的瑜伽裤有更高的“技术含量”。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;比如它86%尼龙和14%莱卡的科学面料配比、Slivere scent防臭技术、裆部无缝裁剪，让它比其他瑜伽裤舒适感更强、排汗性更好、贴身性更好，同时也更修身、更能体现女性的身体曲线。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;这也让lululemon的穿着场景并不局限于瑜伽场馆，很多女性日常生活中也会穿着lululemon出行，拓展了瑜伽裤的使用场景，无形中也提升了lululemon的销量。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;其三，瞄准中产女性。从一开始，lululemon的定价就比较高，它的用户画像是“24岁到36岁之间，年收入8万美元以上的女性，受教育程度高，有自己的房子，每天有一个半小时的时间锻炼，生活态度积极向上”，lululemon称呼她们为“super girl”。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;彼时正好赶上北美中产女性的崛起，她们需要更多自我证明的方式，lululemon的定位与这群女性的需求一拍即合，lululemon成为“super girl”的标识。之后，lululemon在国际市场的扩张，复制了这一路径。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;其四，社区运营。 lululemon几乎不打广告，也没有请大牌明星当代言人，相反，在线下的各种lululemon门店中，成为门店大使的是普通的瑜伽爱好者、运动员、创业者，她们在当地的瑜伽社区中充当意见领袖，她们对lululemon的信赖与选择也影响着其他社区成员。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;同时，lululemon在线下门店中，会不定期举办丰富多彩的社区活动，增强人与人之间的联结，增强消费者对于品牌的认同，将她们转化为品牌的“自来水”。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;其五，也是以上四条的最终目的，确保lululemon的品牌格调，提升品牌溢价，让lululemon成为一种身份、品位与生活方式的象征，让消费者心甘情愿花费更高的价格去购买一条瑜伽裤。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;比如lululemon一条瑜伽裤动辄上千元，外界在吐槽和不解的同时，也不免认为，愿意花费上千元去买一条瑜伽裤，应该是更有财力、对生活品质更有追求、对瑜伽运动更为讲究的人吧？所有奢侈品的品牌溢价都来自这种身份的想象，lululemon同样如此。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;隐忧仍然存在&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;业绩一路狂奔、如今顺风顺水的lululemon并非没有隐忧。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;在小红书等平台上，关于lululemon质量不佳的吐槽声一直不在少数，变形、起球、不吸汗、脱线……看网友有图有真相的爆料，还真以为这是花十几块钱从拼夕夕上购买的产品，可网友晒出的票据又证明了确实是从门店购买的正品。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;动辄几百元上千元，质量如此不堪？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;lululemon的产品来自代工，这也意味着对于品控的要求很高，在高速发展的背景下，代工偷工减料等问题出现，就会对品牌形象产生非常大的冲击。近年来，lululemon的质量问题也被官方几次通报。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;2018年1月，lululemon一款女士针织运动服装因“不合格产品冒充合格产品”，被上海市黄浦区市场监督管理局罚款5.1万元；2019年8月，lululemon再次因“以不合格产品冒充合格产品”，被上海市静安区市场监管局罚款8.19万元；2022年5月，lululemon违反产品质量法第五十条（在产品中掺杂、掺假，以假充真，以次充好，或者以不合格产品冒充合格产品），被北京市西城区市场监督管理局罚款8.142万元。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;虽然lululemon的瑜伽裤拥有不错的技术含量，但服饰领域的核心竞争力并非遥不可及。譬如如今其他瑜伽品牌的面料质感，与lululemon的面料无限接近，除了品牌溢价外，穿着体验并没有价格差距那么明显。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;一方面是lululemon的质量不时有问题，另一方面是lululemon的定价太高、性价比不高，所以，lululemon的“平替”产品大量涌现，MAIA ACTIVE、暴走的萝莉、Particle Fever（粒子狂热）、Keep、迪卡侬等品牌的瑜伽裤都获得不少拥趸，在此背景下，lululemon的品牌溢价是否能够始终保持，只有保持观望的态度了。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;从国外各大奢侈品牌再到lululemon，这些品牌的超高溢价都一再说明了：对于一个品牌，质量很重要，性价比很重要，品牌的打造也至关重要。如果lululemon能够维持它“一览众山小”的品牌位置，仍然会有消费者为之买单——买的不仅仅是瑜伽裤，更是品牌标识。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;当然，lululemon也要确保自己“不作死”。质量问题是个例的话，消费者或许还可忍受，一旦质量问题成常态，科技含量无法保持领先优势，吐槽的声音占据主流，品牌也会轻易从高位落下。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;追赶者固然暂时没有办法达到lululemon的品牌效应，如果能够在质量、科技含量、性价比等方面实现赶超，笑到最后也是有可能的事情。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[免签、“白菜价”能否翻热泰国游？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257673]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 13:01:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;2023年9月25日上午10时15分，从上海出发的泰国亚航XJ761航班降落曼谷素万那普机场，这是泰国对中国游客实施临时免签政策的第一天。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了迎接免签政策后首批抵达泰国的中国游客，泰国总理赛塔·他威信亲率多位部长到机场接机。拥挤的人群、笑脸相迎的官员、手捧鲜花的工作人员……无一不体现着泰式的热情好客。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了素万那普机场，第一批欢迎仪式还在廊曼机场、清迈机场和普吉岛机场同步举行，游客将获赠茉莉花环和带有大象图案的裤子。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;类似的隆重接机不是第一次在泰国出现。2023年1月，泰国副总理阿努廷、旅游与体育部长披帕、交通部长萨撒扬等官员也曾亲赴机场，迎接新冠病毒感染实行“乙类乙管”后首批赴泰中国旅客。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;泰国张开双臂欢迎中国游客，并未完全点燃国人赴泰旅游的热情。2月和3月的短期走热之后，受“噶腰子”等传闻影响，再加上取材自东南亚的犯罪题材电影接连上映，刚刚复苏的“泰国热”再次跌入冰点。2023年上半年，中国已经跌出泰国最大客源地。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此番泰国免签，能否吸引中国游客回归的脚步？&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;泰国急了&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;见到张丽霞的时候，她的黑眼圈浓重，看上去憔悴不堪，明显还没有从前几日的连续忙碌中恢复过来。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张丽霞是广州一家旅行社门店的负责人。9月15日至17日，2023广东国际旅游产业博览会在广州开幕，此后一周，张丽霞都异常忙碌。伴随着中秋国庆长假来临，赴泰国旅游的游客也连带着多了起来。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“因为正好赶上泰国免签，仅仅旅博会这三天时间，找我们报团去泰国旅游的人数就超过了整个上半年。”张丽霞告诉南方周末记者。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;9月13日，泰国内阁会议决定，从2023年9月25日起至2024年2月29日，对中国游客实施为期5个月的免签政策，该时段覆盖中国国庆节、农历新年等国人喜爱出游的时间节点。泰国总理赛塔强调，免签政策还将免除签证费。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实上，当选泰国总理后，赛塔持续将吸引中国游客当作刺激经济复苏的重要抓手。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;接任总理第三天，赛塔就公开宣称，自己将推行一项针对中国和印度公民的免签政策。另据泰国总理府发言人猜·瓦差隆表示，赛塔将于10月访华，促进中泰两国旅游合作将成为主要议题之一。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这一系列举措的背景，是2023年上半年中国游客赴泰旅游的情况难如人意，泰国政府希望通过更有力的措施吸引更多中国游客回归。《曼谷邮报》文章指出，泰国当局旨在通过放宽入境政策来快速刺激旅游业恢复，为经济复苏注入一针强心剂。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;疫情前，中国一度是泰国最大的海外客源国。因此，自2023年中国恢复出境游后，泰国政府对中国游客回归寄予厚望，并在年初设定了吸引500万中国游客的目标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但根据泰国官方公布的数据，截至9月10日，赴泰旅游的中国游客数量仅为228万人次，位居入境游客榜第二位，少于泰国邻国马来西亚。而在2019年，赴泰中国游客数达1098万人次，占泰国所有入境旅客的27.6%。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而反观泰国，也已跌落中国出境目的地榜首位置。从支付宝给出的2023年上半年出境热门目的地交易额来看，泰国处于第四名。前面三名依次为：中国香港、中国澳门和日本。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中国游客赴泰旅游人数不及预期，不仅让泰国官方措手不及，也让国内一众旅行社黯然神伤。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年1月，文旅部公布第一批“恢复出境团队游”的20个国家，泰国赫然在列。受疫情影响，出境游处于停滞状态将近三年。消息发布后，多家旅游企业围绕出境游开始布局，张丽霞便是其中之一。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;回顾上半年的泰国出境游业务，张丽霞用“希望与绝望重复交替”进行总结。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“没想到风向会转得这么快，2月泰国游刚刚有所起色，3、4月就开始出现叫不来客人的情况。”对赴泰国旅游游客数量减少的情况，张丽霞记忆犹新，“操作部的同事早晚不停发广告招揽游客，但是怎么叫也叫不动，价格降到最后实在没得降了，只能自己赔钱承担切位损失。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“切位”是旅游业的专业术语。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;旅行社会提前向航空公司采购一定数量的飞机座位用于销售给游客，这类提前切下的位子不可退还，也不可取消。切位机票可以享受团体票的优惠折扣，但同样存在风险。如果旅游人数比预期要少，那么旅行社就将面临损失。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“白菜价”&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;还拉不到人&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2023年8月初，高斌和一众朋友一起到曼谷和芭提雅旅游。从郑州出发到泰国，加上签证费用和通关小费，六天五晚的旅行只花费不到3000元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“团费之所以如此便宜，主要是因为团期将近，报名的人数不足，旅行社采取了低价甩位策略，比正常团费便宜了一千多块钱。”高斌说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而在广州，同样的纯玩团价格也只需三千多一点。“年初刚开放境外游的时候，大家以为泰国旅游热度来了，再加上航班没有那么多，泰国团队游价格略有上涨。现在虽然泰国免签，但总体需求量并没有大幅度增加，在供需差不多对等的情况下，我们不敢把价格往上调。”张丽霞说，“现在泰国游的价格比三年前还要低。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但“白菜价”依然未能充分打动中国游客。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;泰国落地签证的排队时长，一度是泰国旅游人数多少的“风向标”。高斌曾于2018年和2019年两度到泰国旅游。与此前相比，他明显感觉到赴泰国旅游的中国人少了很多，通关时间快了很多。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“以前来泰国的时候，排队办理落地签至少要等一两个小时，今年只排了差不多二十分钟。出了机场只有零零散散十来个地接团队，不再是之前密密麻麻举着中文标语牌子等待旅游团的盛况了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;泰国游遇冷，直接对接游客的旅行社和酒店有着更深的感触。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李婉是中部某一线城市一家旅行社的经理，2023年上半年，门店仅仅收了三十多个赴泰国旅游的客户，“尽管泰国游的价格已经足够低，但出境游并没怎么恢复”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这样的情况不是个例。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李婉所在省区刚刚召开完暑期复盘会，境内游营业额占暑期旅游收入的80%，出境游只占到20%。“疫情前，营业额基本上是境内境外各占一半。”李婉告诉南方周末记者。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;7、8月份是泰国雨季高峰期，但随着研学游兴起，泰国暑期游学成为中国家长的热门“平替”。然而今年，出境游学在泰国也没能旺起来。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;疫情三年后，王莹对今年暑假的游学项目寄予厚望，她提前包了酒店，和清迈大学的老师做好对接。但令王莹没想到的是，暑假游学竟然罕见爆冷，几乎无人问津，最后她只能无奈取消。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我们最高峰的时候一个暑假曾接待了500个中国人，但今年来报名的寥寥无几。很多人担心安全问题，家里的老人不愿意让小孩到泰国。还有一些确定要报名的人因为所在城市直飞航班突然取消，最后也取消了订单。”在泰国经营研学游多年的王莹对南方周末记者说。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;舆论漩涡&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;中国赴泰旅游遇冷，安全始终是一个绕不开的因素。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年2月，自媒体博主在网上爆出“泰国专噶中国人腰子”“男模餐厅专拐中国女性”的传闻，相关视频和文章刷屏网络。“风光绝美、性价比高”的泰国一度成了“噶腰子”的代名词，以至于不少人“谈泰色变”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;离谱的传闻甚嚣尘上，泰国当局不得不频频辟谣，试图扭转负面传闻对泰国旅游业的巨大杀伤力。然而，官方辟谣并未消除人们对泰国安全问题的质疑，刚有起色的泰国旅游再度遇冷。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“今年，泰国旅游确实受舆论影响较大，不少过来报团的人都会询问泰国到底安不安全，我们只能一次又一次向他们强调跟团游的安全性。”某一线城市旅游业从业者郑云告诉南方周末记者，“为了打消客户的顾虑，我们不得不在朋友圈里转发大量泰国官方的辟谣文章，并推给游客。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，“噶腰子”的争议尚未完全平息，新的舆论危机又接踵而来。6月起，《消失的她》和《孤注一掷》两部取材于东南亚的犯罪题材电影，再次将泰国卷入了风口浪尖。“噶中国游客腰子”的泰国，又被舆论塑造成了缅北电信诈骗“中转站”的角色。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;高斌的一个朋友办好了护照，但家人因为担心安全问题，不同意他去泰国，甚至从老家追到市区，想让他打消去泰国旅游的念头。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;类似的担心，其实不是个案。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;时至今日，一个泰国旅游微信群中，依然有不少网友会时不时抛出泰国旅游是否安全的疑虑。一位买好国庆去泰国机票的游客在群里说，“我没敢说要去泰国，既怕被别人嘲笑，也担心家人不让我去。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“2、3月份的时候，明显感觉到街头的中国游客在增多，朋友圈随便一刷就有三四个人在泰国旅游。”在泰国经营民宿6年的王婉告诉南方周末记者，但到了3月底就完全看不到人了，整个街上空荡荡的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据泰国旅游局分析，中国游客赴泰国旅游增长缓慢可归于4个原因——经济和货币相对疲软、中国政府促进国内旅游和当地交通升级、泰国旅游服务供应不足和生活成本上升，以及有关安全的负面消息正在损害泰国形象。其中，对安全的担忧是最关键因素。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“泰国旅游业面临的最大障碍，是消除对赴泰旅游安全的负面看法。如果不采取行动减少泰国犯罪，消除中国社交媒体上的负面内容，任何口头或书面承诺都将毫无意义。”泰国旅游协会主席西萨迪瓦如是说道。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;赔本赚吆喝&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;免签政策是否能点燃中国游客赴泰旅行的热情，泰国政府显得信心十足。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年9月24日，泰国交通部长素里亚·曾隆良吉告诉《曼谷邮报》，在免签政策推动下，预计来自中国的航班将从每天72个增加至96个，相应的游客数量将实现倍增，从每天9680人增加到18656人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“吸引500万中国游客赴泰旅游完全可以实现。”素里亚信誓旦旦地说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而国内几家在线旅行服务平台上急速攀升的泰国搜索热度，似乎也在印证着“泰国热”的回归。免签消息公布后半小时，携程平台上泰国相关搜索热度环比飙升800%。“去哪儿”大数据也显示，平台泰国机票搜索量环比上周同一时间上涨超七成，泰国酒店搜索量环比上涨1倍。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但这些关注度究竟能多大程度上转化为实际出行人数，从业人士都在持续观望。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;免签政策出台后，王婉本来想考虑将房源提价，但订单量让她打消了涨价的念头。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王婉自营的几家民宿，以往98%都是中国游客，可现在每个月只有百分之二三十的住客来自中国。每年10月至次年2月是泰国旅游旺季，游客一般都会提前订房，王婉的民宿已经预定出去一半的房间，但没有几单来自中国游客。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“最近收到的三个订单分别来自澳大利亚、马来西亚和新加坡，免签后我完全没有收到中国游客的订单。”王婉说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;国庆前泰国游的短暂热度，并未完全打消张丽霞的担忧，她不敢再冒险提前切机位。上半年预估的“泰国热”没有出现，提前包机切位的大量赔付，仍让张丽霞心有余悸。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“3、4月时，泰国六天五晚的旅游行程费用已经降到了最低1999元，而机位费用是2000元，团费已经不足以支付成本。这纯粹是赔本赚吆喝，但依然没有客人愿意来报团。”张丽霞回忆说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“经历了上半年希望与失望的反复折磨，我们的心态都平和了一点。现在都是一星期预定两三趟航班的机位，如果客人增多，再额外购买位置，不会再像以前一样抢着去占50%到80%的位置。”张丽霞叹口气说道，“现在不敢了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;郑云亦指出，国庆前确实忙了一阵，“9月27日至10月2日的泰国团都已收满，而且价格比之前上涨了差不多一千块钱，但后续热度很快就又淡了下来，我们只得将价格也往下降。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于2023年后三个月泰国旅游恢复情况，郑云还是“抱有希望”。但与此同时，她并未准备提前增加包机和切位数量，她并不确定目前国人赴泰的热情能持续多久，“如果后续报团人数增加，我们再同航空公司商量拿机位”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;泰国旅游遇冷之下，航空公司的强势地位也已不像以往。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;航旅纵横大数据显示，8月第1周，国内航司往返泰国的航班量超800班，仅为2019年同期的52%左右。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“2019年时，大家都要提前全款抢机位，谁能拿到机位就能接待更多客人。现在情况已经完全颠倒了过来，只要你有客人，机位随时都有。”张丽霞坦言。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（文中张丽霞、李婉、王莹、王婉、郑云系化名）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 13:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[困在考研考编里的年轻人，他们是在逃避什么吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257615]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;最近几年全国研究生录取人数连年上涨。从2018年的76万，猛涨到去年的125万人，超过60%。而同时期考研的人数，从238万增长到457万，翻了一倍多。每年约七成的考研落榜者，如果选择重考，迎接他们的是下一年更激烈的竞争。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在其他考场，情况也差不多。全国公务员和事业编招考人数大幅增加，报名人数同样暴涨。年轻人毕业后无论冲到哪个考场，都面临不亚于高考的激烈竞争。连考连败者不断累积，变成了媒体挖掘故事的富矿。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最近，三联生活周刊一篇《困在考研考编里的五年》采访一位连续考研、考公和考编者。据讲述者说，她觉得大学所读专业工作上没前途，而家庭对学历有崇拜，于是她就连年考研，同期还考公、考编，一考就是五年。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;五年考试归于失败，这位女生在经济压力下不得不走上职场。她认识到新工作虽然辛苦，至少有“可能性”，“上岸”同学过得其实也没多好。可到文章末尾，这位女生还是念念不忘，今年9月还在参加考试。在读者以为柳暗花明，精神内耗行将结束时，一切回到起点。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当代很多全职考试族，花费大量时间精力，只为将来获得一些不确定优势。以考研说，硕士学历在职场上固然比本科有些优势，考虑到年龄因素，优势其实有限。考公和考编族，他们孜孜以求“铁饭碗”看似很好，可多数岗位职业路径狭窄，收入不算高，而且难以跳槽。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;考研、考公和考编之外，还有规模庞大的“考师”群体。2022年，参加教师资格考试者超过1100万人。很多人什么都考，不管是否喜欢。他们常年持续地考试，不过为了谋求一份体面稳定的工作，这些工作基本在体制内，流动性差，难以跳槽，只是胜在“稳定”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;花费大量时间精力，进行一场人生豪赌，在我看来是可叹的。在人生精力最旺盛的年龄，躲进小楼书斋，悬梁刺股地做题备考，不创造价值，不学知识技能，甚至无法享受快乐。为所谓将来工作稳定，真的值得吗？况且多数人注定失败，只是成为分母而不是分子。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在社交媒体和考试论坛，这种日子却是“励志”。很多人抱团取暖，旁人即便不同意，好像也难以指摘：每个人道路不同，选择无所谓高低吧？职业考试一族越来越多，和就业大环境相关，也和这种氛围相关。一毕业就全职备考，在新世代年轻人那里成了流行现象。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种现象真的无可指摘，甚至是励志吗？不好说。“职业考试族”的前提是：不赚钱，靠供养。大学生毕业后普遍超过二十岁，无法自食其力，而是依赖父母。这种“寄生和供养”都是自愿，有些甚至是父母要求孩子考试，但从社会学角度看，他们不属于成年人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;年轻人受更好的教育，他们摆脱父母荫庇，开创事业，超越父母成就，这是一个健康社会的普遍现象。依赖父母供养，迟迟无法“断奶”，将获取大额财富机会指向继承，并把啃老寄生的生活模式，调侃为“全职儿女”。这种精神流行是一种萎靡堕落，根本不值得美化。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;全职考试者表面追求稳定工作，实质是逃避市场竞争，从暂时被父母供养到希冀被体制供养。即使考上了，他们的收入也是源于税收，而税收依赖于个人与企业创造价值。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这也是国家要求简政放权、裁汰人员的原因。只是由于就业市场压力巨大，公务员和事业编被一些地方视为“就业蓄水池”，这些年地方一边裁员一边扩招。这种做法不能彻底解决就业问题，只不过将为你不断后延。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“被困在考研考编里”的年轻人，不是真的被困住。他们只是希望一考而就，从此摆脱市场竞争，从此高枕无忧。这样的人生选择，我个人不喜欢；而当考公考编成为流行竞赛，越来越多人沉迷其中，对于个人和社会，我相信都不是好事。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很多人觉得，年轻人反复考研考编，是一种无奈选择。某种程度上是对的，不过此种选择不值得鼓励，而且要指出：对个人命运而言，这条悲壮苦情的征途，充满巨大的风险。为了逃避市场竞争愿意花这么大的力气与同龄人“卷”，值得吗？如果把这种动力与努力用到工作上，岂不是有意义多了？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以，反倒另外一条道路，看似荆棘丛生，实际更为靠谱。这两年很多年轻人做以往低学历者从事的工作。他们以务实精神面对，放下高学历自尊，先养活自己，再徐图发展。相比沉迷考试的一族，这种选择更值得尊重，也更可能收获美好人生。&lt;/p>;
