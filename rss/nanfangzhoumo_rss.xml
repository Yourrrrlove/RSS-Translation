Young writers Ban Yu, Chen Chuncheng, and Wang Suxin , Danbao (Liu Xueting) is on the list. The &quot;Writer&#39;s Examination for Editor&quot; once again caused netizens to lament that &quot;the end of the universe is the editor&#39;s examination&quot;. In recent years, as the number of applicants for the postgraduate entrance examination has continued to rise, the word &quot;going ashore&quot; is always on the lips of young people.</description><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[她年少成名，十四年后拍出新片再得大奖]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260408]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-11 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;At the end of August 2023, for the promotion of the movie &quot;It&#39;s a Worth It&quot;, director Liu Jiayin registered for the first time Weibo. In order to learn how to use it skillfully, she specially asked a friend to teach her online, wrote her first tweet, and left an anxious message to the producer&#39;s account: &quot;I seem to have #(marked) the wrong content, why is it different from yours?&quot; ?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; is Liu Jiayin&#39;s third feature film, but she said, &quot;To a certain extent, this is my debut film.&quot; This film is her first time working with professional actors and a filming team, which requires a lot of communication work. The introverted Liu Jiayin needs to take a brand new step. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/JOgJRXabKSXRlbZ1QshfSkuDgbg7YvsEQMbBRIbh.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/JOgJRXabKSXRlbZ1QshfSkuDgbg7YvsEQMbBRIbh.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257870&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 2023, director Liu Jiayin released her new feature film &quot;Worth It&quot; after a lapse of fourteen years. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Jiayin is a teacher in the Literature Department of Beijing Film Academy. In her 17 years of teaching, she has often been criticized by her colleagues. Ask the same question as the students: &quot;When will you make a movie again?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To a certain extent, Liu Jiayin can be regarded as famous at a young age. In her first year of graduate school, at just 24 years old, she made her debut with the feature film &quot;Cowhide&quot; shot on DV. &quot;Won an important award in the Youth Forum section of the Berlin Film Festival. At the age of 28, she was shortlisted for the Cannes Film Festival Directors&#39; Fortnight for &quot;Cowhide 2&quot; and became a young director of great concern to the international film community. But for the next fourteen years, due to various reasons, she had no new films released. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;People around me are asking why I stopped filming? The motivation brought by pressure is huge.&quot; Liu Jiayin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first two movies, Liu Jiayin took care of almost all the affairs of the crew by herself. She was the director, screenwriter and photographer, as well as the producer and starring role. &quot;It was the era of DV, and I am particularly grateful to this period. I was definitely a beneficiary of it. This equipment was very suitable for my personality of &#39;working alone&#39;.&quot; Liu Jiayin recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, Liu Jiayin began to officially write the script of &quot;It&#39;s a Worth It&quot;. The final version was more than 60,000 words long, which is more than twice the length of ordinary scripts. Liu Jiayin also wrote a novel of more than 100,000 words for the characters in the script, describing the life of the novel&#39;s protagonist Wen Shan in more detail. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The original title of &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; was &quot;Listening&quot;, not only because Wen Shan&#39;s work in the film requires listening to complete, but also because of Liu Jiayin&#39;s insights in life, &quot;Listening is not hearing. It’s about understanding the other person and learning to think from the other person’s perspective.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wen Shan, the protagonist of &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot;, is a frustrated screenwriter. He gave up his original profession because he couldn&#39;t write the stories that Party A needed, and accidentally became a eulogy writer. . This new career requires him to learn to listen to other people&#39;s stories and restore the emotions of the deceased to the deceased, and his own life has also turned around. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every time he receives an order, Wenshan will visit the relatives and friends of the deceased and take a lot of notes to learn as much as possible about the deceased. He interviewed his sister who felt sorry for her brother who always acted as a &quot;good guy&quot; and could not let go of him until his death; he met a son who was busy with work and neglected to communicate with his old father when he was still alive, so he could only regret it for the rest of his life; he also got to know the man who had traveled thousands of miles from Gansu to A persistent girl in Beijing who explores the true state of deceased netizens... Among Wenshan&#39;s many clients, there is also Aunt Fang, a cancer patient who booked a eulogy for herself early. After learning that she had cancer, she chose to actively &quot;fight towards death&quot; born&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this job, Wenshan healed his clients and himself. Starring Hu Ge told Southern Weekend reporters that Wen Shan&#39;s work is to influence others, &quot;nourishing the living with the dead&quot; and allowing the living to feel the meaning of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the film, Wenshan finally had the courage to face his past failures, and he could face the script that he could not finish no matter what, and write characters he believed in. &quot;The most important thing is that life recognizes Wen Shan.&quot; Liu Jiayin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2023, the 25th Shanghai International Film Festival awarded the Best Director Award to Liu Jiayin, and she was once again recognized by the Class A film festival. In September, &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; was officially released, which was Liu Jiayin&#39;s first movie to be released in public. After the movie was released, her Weibo really played a &quot;listening&quot; role. She received hundreds of private messages from viewers. People shared their feelings about watching the movie with the director in text, pouring out their deepest feelings to their relatives and friends. emotions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/3xag3euF7p72ekhzeSAG05CHQ01sjah9F058FATw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/3xag3euF7p72ekhzeSAG05CHQ01sjah9F058FATw.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257871&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the process of directing a new film, listening and cooperation have taken on a new meaning for Liu Jiayin (second from right). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A pair of elderly sisters in their seventies, suffering from lung cancer and breast cancer respectively, They actively treated each other and encouraged each other, while accompanying their 95-year-old mother until her old age. After watching &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; four times, my sister wrote in a private message: &quot;We wrote eulogies for our mother, but we were shy to express our love in front of her; just like Wen Shan, when he was down and out, he was confused and inferior, and he struggled to give up... Your story allows us to see ourselves.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A young girl shared the story of her mother who died after eight years of suffering from cancer. &quot;It would be great if my mother could leave the traces of her short life on paper. I am also a filmmaker. I hope that one day I can have my mother&#39;s story well recorded...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;Some of the people who shared regretted being too rebellious when their grandma was alive, some did not catch up with their relatives for the last time, and some opened up their hearts with their families because of this movie... These stories flew into Liu Jiayin&#39;s mailbox one after another, and she would Try to reply one by one during work breaks. &quot;These strangers gave me a lot of encouragement. This is the most meaningful part of the movie.&quot; Liu Jiayin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Very specific fears” bring huge creative motivation&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;When you first made a movie, you chose one person to do everything. Isn’t this a very common approach? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Jiayin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;If it were the kind of movie machine that I used to have, I might not be able to afford it, nor would I know how to cooperate with others. I was using a DV player. At that time, there were still many doubts about using such a special method to shoot movies. So I chose not to listen, thinking that I could just make it myself. I grew up slowly after the age of 30 and began to learn how to communicate. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The earliest name of &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; is &quot;Listen&quot;, how do you understand this name? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Jiayin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After working, I gradually discovered that in life we ​​really need to listen. Listening is not about hearing, but about truly understanding the other person. Not only have I been misunderstood by others in my life, but I have also misunderstood others. After something like this happens again and again, you need to constantly correct your views on others, and you need to listen to them. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Many people may be concerned about the aftermath of &quot;Niuhide&quot; , why did it take fourteen years to make a movie, and why is this &quot;A Journey Well Worth It&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Jiayin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I am not a person who does things very quickly. I have my own rhythm, and I may not have waited for the story I particularly wanted to tell. The things I encounter every day in my daily life are very specific, and there are also some rewards and fun, so I have a lot of &quot;excuses&quot; not to create. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, the prototype of the character Wen Shan came into being, and it took several years. The character didn&#39;t have a name at the time, but I felt that he often appeared in my life, even in my room, and I would always think of him, so I gave him a name and determined to write his story. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Your previous two movies are very close to your own life Yes, you and your family are directly on the scene. &quot;It&#39;s a Worth It&quot; is a completely fictional film. What is its relationship with your own life? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Jiayin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The previous creations were quite experimental, and &quot;Worthless Journey&quot; is different in every aspect. To a certain extent, it is My debut novel. But this movie still has a lot to do with my personal experience. It is a summary of my life over the past ten years, and everything I want to say is in it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Looking back over the past ten years, do you think you What are the changes? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Jiayin: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When I was filming &quot;Cowhide&quot;, I was young, so I just gritted my teeth and made the film. Now my mentality is more complicated and requires greater drive. will be more rational. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I haven’t made a movie for a long time, and there is a high probability that I will never make another one, but I almost never stopped thinking about it. As I get older, I realize that time is limited, and I am afraid of it. If I don’t do something, I can predict what will happen in the future. This is a very specific fear, and it brings great motivation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From 2006 to the present, you have been a university teacher for seventeen years. What impact has your teaching experience had on you? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Jiayin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;If I want to teach my class well, I must understand my students. This process is not particularly easy for me, especially since I am very bad at interacting with people. Every time I open the door to meet new students in the new semester, I need to do some mental construction. But what I teach is how to write stories. You must know why students write such things. You can&#39;t just say whether it is good or not. You need to understand them through stories. After slowly adjusting, I roughly knew how to express myself and take care of every student as much as possible. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;You can find the answer by living seriously&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;Wenshan needs to come into contact with all kinds of people in his work. Several of his customers appear in the movie, and they all have their own stories. Do these characters have life prototypes? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Jiayin: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There is no prototype. It mainly comes from daily observation of life and the screenwriter’s skills. A screenwriter should write in a way that makes people believe. In fact, I don’t have any creative skills, I just live seriously. The client&#39;s story is different in age, relationship with deceased relatives and friends, and understanding of emotions. It is similar to the situations we encounter in life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wen Shan can’t be a good screenwriter, what do you think? Where is the problem stuck? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Jiayin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Human beings have a natural part, coupled with their experiences from childhood to adulthood, they have shaped us together and made us what we are today. look. I think Wen Shan encountered too many rejections in his previous work as a screenwriter. He was thought that the things he wrote were too ordinary, not enough for this, not enough for that. In short, the characters he wrote were &quot;not worthy&quot; of being the protagonists. After Wen Shan was denied again and again, he gradually began to doubt himself. Especially when you still can&#39;t pay the rent a few years after graduation and have to ask your parents for rent, it&#39;s a very difficult feeling. This sense of failure not only denies work, but also denies values. Do you think, &quot;Is the way I look at life wrong?&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think Wenshan has not tried to defend himself, but his voice is too soft. In this case, a person&#39;s personality will also change. But to a certain extent, a screenwriter who fails to defend his story is failing to defend himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Do you think life finally recognized Wen Shan? What does it look like specifically? Recognition? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Jiayin: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After writing the eulogy, he found that what he had been denied before found answers in life. We can be affected by some small things, and we can also establish real connections with other people. These people are either very dramatic people in the script, or ordinary people who are inconspicuous, but they are very important to the people around them and are important to them. They themselves are also important. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After this, Wen Shan will continue to write stories without any obstacles in his heart. We are often like this, always troubled by some invisible and intangible things, but I am convinced that we can find the answer as long as we live seriously. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you hope the audience will see through this movie? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Jiayin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;For most people, it is much easier to deny themselves than to affirm themselves. This may be the life of adults. But people still have to care about themselves in the end. &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; tells the story of Wen Shan&#39;s process of starting to care about himself. He realized that his feelings and things he did were important. This may also be the reason why many viewers left me messages saying they saw themselves in the movie. Those who are completely indifferent after watching this movie are the lucky ones, because no one in this movie really succeeds. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The appearance of &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; can Does it solve some of your previous life confusions to a certain extent? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Jiayin: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think it was because I solved these confusions that I came up with this movie. In other words, after knowing yourself, you must accept yourself. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[担心被称“普信”，不敢接触异性：一位大学老师对男生女生的观察]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260410]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-11 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On a recent Friday, at 2:30 in the afternoon, I parked my car in the parking lot of Guangzhou University and found that the playground There were two boys playing basketball, and they came to play so early. My curiosity drove me to get closer. I pitched and chatted with them. They are freshmen from the School of Foreign Languages. They are not only classmates, but also fellow Zhanjiang fellows. It happened that there were no classes or homework on Friday afternoon, so we were bored, so we met to play basketball. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Men and women are clearly differentiated&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As I walked, I asked how many people were in their class. They told me that there were 34 girls and 5 boys. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Why didn&#39;t you think about asking the female classmates in the class to go out for fun?&quot; I asked casually. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They were quite surprised by my suggestion: &quot;Teacher, I don&#39;t know any of the girls in the class.&quot; &quot;Teacher, I know two girls in our class, but they asked me to date them. This is absolutely impossible.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There are 34 girls, how many people have you added to WeChat?&quot; I continued to ask. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I added 5 people, but I don’t have much contact with them.” Classmate A said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Three, and they are all cadres in the class, but I only contact them when something happens.&quot; Classmate B replied to me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;You are a freshman now. You should have a lot of courses, and there should be many opportunities to take classes together.&quot; I continued to ask. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Yes, we have classes together almost every day. The problem is that although we are in the same classroom, boys sit with boys and girls sit with girls. In class, they mainly listen to the teacher&#39;s lectures; after class, they disperse separately. , there is little communication and interaction with each other.&quot; Student A said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Both boys and girls, everyone deliberately keeps their distance. Everyone agrees that as soon as they enter the classroom, boys and girls will sit separately.&quot; Classmate B added. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Theoretically, college students should have relatively free control of their time. Their physical and mental development has matured, and their need for interaction with the opposite sex is relatively strong. It is normal for them to date and become friends with the opposite sex, but the reality is not in this way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although classmates in the same class can meet every day and have many contact opportunities, having contact opportunities does not necessarily mean that substantial familiarity, understanding and understanding will occur in real life. Where is &quot;Geng&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Seeing the confusion on my face, classmate B told me the whole story, &quot;Teacher, have you heard of some hot words on the Internet, such as &#39;licking the dog&#39;, &#39;lowering the head&#39; and &#39;Pu Xin&#39;?&quot; ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After his explanation, I realized that among boys and girls, the one who takes the initiative to add the other party’s WeChat account or asks for the other party’s contact information will be considered by a small number of members of the opposite sex to be a “dog licker” and a “lower” person. This situation is relatively common for boys who take the initiative. In other words, when a boy takes the initiative to add a friend to a girl he is interested in or finds interesting, some girls will think this is a strange thing and ask, &quot;What do you want to do?&quot; &quot;What are your intentions?&quot; &quot;Do you want to pursue her?&quot; Me?&quot; If the boy is not the right person for the girl, the girl will think that the boy is &quot;general trustworthy&quot;, which means &quot;ordinary but confident&quot;. The problem is that some girls may not think this way, but in order to avoid girls thinking this way, boys do not want to be misunderstood and bear the stigmatized label of &quot;normal men&quot;, so they would rather or simply not be active or take the initiative to avoid embarrassment, even in the face of The girl you are most attracted to or the girl you like the most. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Does the teacher know about the &#39;campus wall&#39;?&quot; Classmate A asked me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course I don’t know. He explained to me this way: &quot;It is a public platform for students to publish information. It seems that every university has it. For example, once I join someone else and I am rejected, they will remove me. If I post screenshots of others on the &#39;campus wall&#39;, then all the students in the school will know about me, and I will be polite and sweep the floor in school, unable to hold my head up.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I can&#39;t control the other person&#39;s thinking, thoughts and actions. , I am even more unable to face and avoid this kind of risk, so I will not take the initiative to get close to the opposite sex.&quot; Classmate B said helplessly. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Invisible Wall&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This reminds me of: A year ago, I played ball with several boys from my senior graduating class. They told me that after four years, they could not recognize any of them. Students in the same class may not be able to name their classmates. In their eyes, students of the opposite sex in the same class or major are just &quot;classmates&quot; rather than &quot;friends&quot;, &quot;close friends&quot; or &quot;besties&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to my observation, a basic feeling is that the current friendship or friendship between college students in the same major or class, especially between people of the opposite sex, is very weak. They are either busy or idle, and they are busy. Even if they may have a crush on a classmate of the opposite sex, they will never take the initiative or actively express their needs or wishes to make friends or interact with each other. In other words, after entering college, an &quot;invisible heart wall&quot; suddenly appears between boys and girls. This wall imprisons boys and girls, and no one wants to take the initiative to tear down this wall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, it was high school before entering college. The relationship between classmates in high school was generally very good. They got along with each other day and night, discussed and solved problems together, had fun and decompressed together. The boys handed ambiguous notes to the girls they liked, and the girls Look at the boy you like a few more times, meet at a corner of the school gate next night during self-study, and arrange to go home together. When you are excited, hold each other&#39;s hand and give him warmth, strength or encouragement. How normal is this? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;My college years&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;I can’t help but think of my college career, which was from 1997 to 2001. In the first class in the first week after the military training, the head teacher spent two whole classes asking each student to come up to the podium and introduce themselves. Then everyone went to a restaurant at the school gate to have lunch together, and they quickly became familiar with each other. . Boys and girls meet together for morning reading, breakfast, and class; after dinner, everyone has evening self-study together. After self-study, they play badminton for an hour on a wide road in the school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public displays of love were also extremely common at that time. When it comes to the person of the opposite sex they like, a generous and cheerful person will express their feelings directly, &quot;Can I ask you to watch a movie?&quot;; a shy and reserved person will use an intermediary to act as a matchmaker and express their intention to date through a small note or letter. If two people have dinner together, watch a movie (usually an all-night movie), and then hold hands, it basically declares that the &quot;intimate male-female relationship&quot; has been basically established. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, it is normal to express this emotion or affection to someone you like or like. I remember clearly that there were 42 people in our class, 22 boys and 20 girls. When I graduated as a senior, there were as many as 5 couples. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Concerned about the values ​​​​and true psychology of contemporary college students&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Boys today are generally not interested in love, don’t they want to know and understand girls? Or on the contrary, are girls today generally not interested in falling in love and not wanting to get to know and understand boys? I feel neither. Faced with the overall environment of high employment pressure, some people have been nervous since their freshman year and are busy with postgraduate entrance examinations, public entrance examinations, College English Level 4 and 6, driver&#39;s licenses, teacher qualification certificates, etc. However, in addition to &quot;many things to do&quot;, they When people still feel lonely or lonely in their hearts, they also long to meet or have a beautiful love. The problem is that no one wants to be considered a &quot;dog-licking tribe&quot;, &quot;Xiatou tribe&quot; or &quot;Puxin tribe&quot;, and no one wants to take the initiative Go out and get to know the opposite sex. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Contemporary college students are relatively unfamiliar with their classmates, so who are they relatively familiar with? It is understood that compared to students taking public courses or professional courses, it is easier for them to get acquainted with people who have the same or similar interests or hobbies. For example, the relationship between classmates within hip-hop clubs, literary clubs, basketball clubs, opera clubs, etc. should be close to classmates who have taken the same professional course. The reason is that various clubs are more in line with the interests or hobbies of students. This is what they like or like to do in their hearts. Everyone communicates and learns skills together, and closely cooperates and collaborates together, which can often brew the seeds of emotion. And in In professional courses, the course itself may be relatively difficult, and most students are not very interested in discussing or communicating together, so the establishment of close relationships naturally takes a long time. From a spatial perspective, professional classrooms are formal, formal and serious spaces, while various clubs are informal, informal and leisure spaces. The latter make people relatively relaxed, relaxed and natural. This is the informal space. effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let college students feel more relaxed and light, make them feel physically and mentally happy, let them dare and have the courage to do the &quot;duty things&quot; that suit their age group, let the friendship between classmates return to innocence and depth, and let the conversation Talking about love has become a matter of course, which is what the new atmosphere of contemporary college students should mean. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to achieve the above goals, I believe that relevant parties should pay more attention to the values ​​​​and true psychology and mentality of contemporary college students. Each university has set up public required courses on the psychology of college students to encourage and advocate the construction of an open An inclusive and harmonious relationship between men and women breaks down all kinds of conceptual barriers and obstacles that create gender opposition and hostility. In terms of course learning, teachers may wish to encourage students to conduct group discussions, and suggest that men and women be paired into groups to create a good atmosphere for heterosexual discussions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, relevant parties should find breakthroughs in extracurricular time, fill students&#39; extracurricular time with as many public activities as possible, and create opportunities for male and female students to contact, understand and understand each other, such as organizing students to carry out Campus tours, city tours, outings, autumn outings, weekend hikes or dinner parties, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a professor at the Department of Sociology, Guangzhou University)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010; &quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[辛柏青：适度的，饱满的]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260363]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-11 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/08/3o5PaHrmlWyAEtsipZOYUbuJyvzjyK2zBnv225d7.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/3o5PaHrmlWyAEtsipZOYUbuJyvzjyK 2zBnv225d7. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257463&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the respondent/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Time&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2020, director Zhang Lu returned to Beijing from South Korea and was quarantined in a hotel in Guangzhou for two weeks in accordance with the COVID-19 prevention and control policy at the time. He wrote a script and sent it to Xin Baiqing, saying that the protagonist Gu Wentong was written for him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gu Wentong is from Beijing. He is divorced. His daughter is fostered at his sister’s house. He lives in the old house left by his mother. He has an affair with a young girl and then separates. His best friend as a boy is in a foreign country. suicide. This person who once wrote poetry now makes a living by writing articles about food. He wanders the streets and alleys of Beijing, lonely, and has a sense of drifting that cannot be stabilized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Actor Xin Baiqing previously collaborated with Zhang Lu in &quot;The Long Confession&quot; (2021) - the brothers Lichun and Lidong went to Japan from Beijing to find Yanagawa, a girl with whom they had a bond when they were young. Having something on your mind. Xin Baiqing plays Li Chun, who already has a family. He goes to a foreign country and hides his loneliness and discomfort in a nonchalant way. He said, &quot;Director Zhang Lu prefers to write about people who have a sense of wandering and loneliness.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xin Baiqing let Zhang Lu see this feeling at a certain moment when Xin Baiqing was resting or lost in thought on the set. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gu Wentong lives next to the White Tower, and Xin Baiqing also grew up in Beijing. Zhang Lu once said that Xin Baiqing has the &quot;not anxiousness&quot; of an old Beijinger. People who are not in a hurry seem to be taking things too slowly, have heavier traces of time on their bodies, and have a closer relationship with the past than those who keep running forward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gu Wentong in &quot;The Light of the White Tower&quot; looks like a man trapped in time. He wears lazy cloth shoes, only a ginger corduroy jacket and a floppy backpack. Most of the time Walking, occasionally taking the bus, and eating braised food that &quot;only people over fifty years old miss&quot; are separated from everything that is happening at the moment, and I am used to saying sorry to everyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Why do I look at such a person more often?&quot; Zhang Lu said in an interview with &quot;Watching Movies&quot;, &quot;Because for this kind of person, the past time is still there, and the present time is still there. Subtle changes have occurred, and two things from time are squeezing on him.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Gu Wentong, the past time and the present state are both related to the missing father: the five-year-old In 2006, my father was accused of molesting a woman on the bus and my mother kicked him out of the house. When he reached middle age, he suddenly received news that his father&#39;s &quot;hooligan crime&quot; was an unjust case. For so many years, his father had been watching him from a distance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scene of reconciliation between father and son was brief. The two danced a ballroom dance in a simple room accompanied by DVD footage from the last century. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two grown men dancing together is not a Chinese way of expressing emotions, let alone Xin Baiqing&#39;s. He asked Zhang Lu, how to dance? Zhang Lu said that he can dance when the time comes. He asked Tian Zhuangzhuang, who played the father, that he could understand all the scenes in the script and could imagine the final appearance, but the dancing scene was weird. Tian Zhuangzhuang also said that there will be a solution on that day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When that day came, Xin Baiqing said one line first: Dad, stand up. The two of them jumped stiffly a few times. Xin Baiqing said to Tian Zhuangzhuang, Dad, the blood vessels in your hands are like earthworms - this is what his daughter said to Gu Wentong before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tian Zhuangzhuang glanced at his hand, and then put his hand on Xin Baiqing&#39;s shoulder. Dancing comes naturally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That’s right, Xin Baiqing sighed. &quot;With this one action, my father&#39;s emotions for so many years fell into his hands and onto my shoulders. This action is small, but it contains too much content.&quot; He thought, &quot;When you go straight to the result and the goal, When you are doing this, you will wonder why it is so difficult? But forget about the result and purpose, and when you enjoy the process and express it, the results will appear naturally.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/35L5QZOT7RYnaU2SmvxFrPGenorKPmviuYXjG1ST.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias /image/23/11/08/35L5QZOT7RYnaU2SmvxFrPGenorKPmviuYXjG1ST.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257460&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Movie &quot;The Light of the White Tower&quot; Stills &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;People&#39;s Insurance Drama&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On October 27, 2023, &quot;The Light of the White Tower&quot; will be released. The film was shortlisted for the main competition of the 73rd Berlin Film Festival at the beginning of the year. In April, director Zhang Lu attended the &quot;Light of the White Tower&quot; post-screening event at the Beijing Film Festival and commented, &quot;Xin Baiqing&#39;s performance is self-evident. It&#39;s easy to win awards for hard-working performances. Xin Baiqing deserves the award.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;In terms of fame, Xin Baiqing may not be a first-line star actor. In some years, he did not have many film and television works. But in the movie &quot;Legend of the Demon Cat&quot; (2017), in just a few scenes, the audience was completely attracted by his performance as Li Bai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He only has one scene in the script: Gao Lishi carries Li Bai to the Banquet of Bliss. Li Bai was drunk and composed a poem, &quot;The clouds want the clothes and the flowers want the face.&quot; Drunkness is the keynote. Xin Baiqing thought, does he really want to act drunk? &quot;My understanding of Li Bai is that it was a period when Li Bai was particularly sober, because all his illusions about his official career had been shattered. Everyone was praising him for being a high official. He knew very well that it was over.&quot; To have Drunk state, but you must be sober and cannot act drunk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the set, director Chen Kaige said that there would be no need to walk in the scene later, and he would just shoot it directly. Great, Xin Baiqing later said, &quot;I am willing to collide with the most vivid things.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first shot was passed in one go. When he got to the monitor, Chen Kaige first said something off-topic, &quot;We have to cooperate in the future&quot;; then he showed Xin Baiqing the monitor: Xin Baiqing sat up, stretched out, and rubbed against the golden tortoise, and then asked Concubine Yang Youyou ,who are you? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Kaige said, this is Li Bai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;TV drama viewers may have known Xin Baiqing through &quot;Happiness is Like a Flower&quot; (2005) in the early years or &quot;Da Qin Fu&quot; (2020) in recent years. The role that really makes him remembered is Zhou Bingyi in the period drama &quot;Human World&quot; (2022) - the eldest brother in an ordinary family in Northeast China: sent to the countryside as an educated youth, admitted to Peking University, and later became an official with outstanding contributions during the reform and opening up period. The shadow of many people in special times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Screenwriter Wang Haiyu received an invitation to adapt and read Liang Xiaosheng’s original novel. He felt that the description of Zhou Bingyi was relatively thin, such as the process of demolishing the &quot;Guangzi Film&quot; in the shantytown where he grew up after he took over the government. Passed a few pens. In Wang Hailu’s story, his younger brother Zhou Bingkun represents the family (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;the grassroots people&lt;/span>;), and his older brother Zhou Bingyi represents the country (&lt;span style=&quot; font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Government officials&lt;/span>;) are the backbone. So she put a lot of effort into writing the scene after Zhou Bingyi became a leading cadre. &quot;If I have to say it, the first half of this play is Zhou Bingkun&#39;s home court, and the second half is Zhou Bingyi&#39;s home court,&quot; she said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About halfway through the broadcast of &quot;Human World&quot;, Wang Hailu and Xin Baiqing met at an event. Zhou Bingyi&#39;s highlight hasn&#39;t been aired yet. Wang Haiyuan doesn&#39;t know what Xin Baiqing can do. The two parties only exchanged a few polite words. She seemed to have heard Xin Baiqing say, &quot;This script is very literary.&quot; She thought this was just a polite comment. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After watching the complete drama, Wang Hailu regretted not chatting more with Xin Baiqing, &quot;This is such a good actor.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;A brief example: watching the demolition of shantytowns in the drama Before that scene, I was a little nervous. I gave Zhou Bingyi a few thousand words of lines for that scene. When the plot came to that point, I could only write it like this. I thought the director might have a way to reduce the difficulty of performing this scene during filming. ——I didn’t dare to expect the actor to fulfill his wish. At that time, I had the impression that Xin Baiqing was a niche actor in literary films. ——Unexpectedly, the ten-minute scene was filmed in one shot. Xin Baiqing used his His understanding of the characters, his talent in temperament, and his line skills have successfully endowed him with the real nobility that a ruler should have.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than a year has passed since the premiere of &quot;Human World&quot;, and Zhou Bingyi was demolished in a shanty town. Clips of handling disputes on the spot and explaining policies to neighborhood friends whom he has known since childhood are still circulated on self-media and have become classic examples of both performance and speech. Wang Haiyuan started her career as a novelist, and was later transferred to the General Political Repertory Theater to do drama. She said, &quot;At that time, I often heard senior teachers say that the theater protects the people, and the people protect the opera. The success of Zhou Bingyi&#39;s character must be the people protect the opera.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/BRGvtnAAlX0OGVZ0J1Igr0XPE8tD9S34KazHwDXT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data -src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/BRGvtnAAlX0OGVZ0J1Igr0XPE8tD9S34KazHwDXT.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257461&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;A person&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;After &quot;The Human World&quot;, Xin Baiqing received a large number of official roles. But he doesn&#39;t want to be typecast. Only fresh roles can arouse his curiosity. He filmed the first feature film &quot;Three Decades&quot; by documentary director Xu Tong, playing the villain Yan Yonggang, and starring with Duan Yihong who played the policeman Jia Guozhi. In the prosperous era, Yan Yonggang injured policeman Jia Guozhi during a pursuit. Jia was not killed, and Yan was not arrested. A blood feud was formed, but a sympathy for each other was born. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his original novel &quot;Jinbao Island&quot;, Xu Tong wrote about Yan Yonggang, a son of an official, like this: his actions are dark, his person is fair, and he has a sinister aura. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Tong and Xin Baiqing went to the writer Acheng&#39;s house to discuss the adaptation of &quot;Zhenbao Island&quot;. That was the first time he met Xin Baiqing. As soon as he parked the car, he saw Xin Baiqing arriving in an SUV behind him. Alone, no team, no assistant. &quot;I felt very comfortable at that time. He was very natural and alone. He didn&#39;t have the habits of the entertainment industry or the behavior of actors.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After meeting at Acheng&#39;s house, Ah Cheng Cheng told Xu Tong, pay attention, Bai Qing is holding her breast. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Tong later observed carefully that Xin Baiqing had no breasts at all. He was about 1.8 meters tall and stood straight. Xu Tong asked Xin Baiqing, has he always been in this shape? Xin Baiqing said yes. It has been like this for decades, and he is neither fat nor thin at all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Tong understood that Acheng was not referring to the body shape, but to the impression that Xin Baiqing was holding her breasts. &quot;Because of his thin temperament and subtlety.&quot; Similarly, Xu Tong found that Xin Baiqing had a special look in his eyes, &quot;He looks at things, not directly with his eyes shining, but as if there is a gap between them. Layers of things, the light is recycled and contained inside.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Aware of these two points, and looking at the characters created by Xin Baiqing, Xu Tong felt, &quot;His expressions are moderate and at the same time full and full. It means that the thing behind his back is full.&quot; Chen Kaige had a similar evaluation of Xin Baiqing. He said that Xin Baiqing &quot;eats very deeply and vomits very little.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the spring of 2022, &quot;Three Decades&quot; will start filming in Shaanxi. Xin Baiqing promised Xu Tong to join the group in advance and turned down other arrangements. &quot;After he said the Spring Festival, I walked over.&quot; Xu Tong recalled, &quot;Looking back on our work during that period, I feel that he is not an actor. He did not regard our cooperation as a project. He just Create a character. Familiarize yourself with the environment, enter the space, and then get into the character.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There was a script reading before the start of filming, and everyone didn&#39;t talk much. Xu Tong said that Xin Baiqing and Duan Yihong had already turned the characters over and over. If you understand everything thoroughly and talk too much, it will affect the spontaneity of the scene. He described the performances of the two actors as &quot;very exciting and very surprising&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although they were happy to work together, Xu Tong and Xin Baiqing did not interact much after that drama. Part of the reason is Xu Tong&#39;s intention. &quot;I need to keep a distance from the actors in order to create a sense of strangeness. Having too many personal relationships will affect my imagination of the characters in the future.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He feels that Xin Baiqing is more I understand this, so I rarely appear outside of the role. &quot;If the audience is too familiar with your face, when you create a character again, the credibility of that character will be reduced, or the impact will be lost.&quot; It will decrease.&quot; A good actor needs to maintain a considerable degree of solitude. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/WiaFJATdWFFloHdXydwOnr5AsDfw9IIQK1u6CqPj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;609&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/WiaFJATdWFFloHdXydwOnr5AsDfw9IIQK1u6CqPj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257464&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;三板AX ”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The partners of Xin Baiqing we found are very willing to talk about his performances, but it is not easy to talk about performances with him himself. Like Zhang Lu said, he was holding on to his mouth; or like Xu Tong That said, he was recycling it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rather than describing his mental journey in detail, he would rather summarize it this way:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“My working method is to try my best to turn literary descriptions into visual images. The first step is my Where does the image come from? What does he look like, what is his hairstyle, what clothes he wears, whether he wears glasses, the way he walks, the way he talks, and whether he has any habitual movements. In fact, these are all learned when he was in school. The most basic. Then, some of the background of the script is not written in the script, but I want to give him some rich emotional relationships, or some experiences, so that I can imagine a deeper dimension for this character. After the performance, This character will not be so one-sided and single, and the audience will feel that he may have more aspects and three-dimensionality.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The basic skill of this actor is to observe life, there are no other skills, nothing new The content is all three-dimensional, but you have to do these three things in a down-to-earth manner, that is, the actor is armed to the teeth.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is by relying on these three things that he leaves his comfort time and time again. District and meet the challenges of new roles. &quot;When I take a role, I only consider whether I am interested in it, not whether I can control it. When I see a new role and I can&#39;t control it, I stop acting, and there will never be any progress.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At first glance Look, Li Chun in &quot;The Long Confession&quot; looks nothing like Xin Baiqing. Producer Xu Jiahan recalled that the first actor selected by the crew was Zhang Luyi, who will play the younger brother Lidong, a somewhat stubborn middle-aged literary artist suffering from cancer. They asked Zhang Luyi, find yourself a brother, who is suitable? Brother Lichun is a bit like the opposite of Lidong, secular and open-minded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Luyi replied: Xin Baiqing. He felt that Xin Baiqing was a bit &quot;sultry&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So there was the first collaboration between Xin Baiqing and director Zhang Lu. In a scene, in a Japanese B&amp;B, Li Chun and his young lover Yanagawa sat opposite each other and talked, and Xin Baiqing burst into tears, &quot;It was telling and repenting. I felt that kind of expression was particularly clear.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Lu yelled, come on, one more line, and asked Xin Baiqing to say his lines to the wall. &quot;I thought at the time, wasn&#39;t the one just now bad? Of course I didn&#39;t discuss it with the director. Since there is already a stronger expression, I will repeat what the director said.&quot; In the next line, Xin Baiqing turned his back to the camera and muttered to himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the finished film, Zhang Lu used the latter one. Xin Baiqing thought, yes, Lichun may have feelings for Yanagawa, or maybe he just came here to find himself. &quot;And my kind of performance limits all possibilities to one, but makes the road narrower.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;Xin Baiqing quickly understood Zhang Lu&#39;s style. He said that watching Zhang Lu&#39;s movies is like reading poetry, and there is no standard answer. When I interviewed Zhang Lu at the end of 2020, he indeed said that movies should be like poetry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the role of Li Chun, Xin Baiqing won the China Film Golden Rooster Award for Best Supporting Actor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the time of &quot;The Light of the White Tower&quot;, the two had a very good understanding and didn&#39;t have too much discussion. Zhang Lu would ask him if he felt comfortable acting? Quite comfortable. That’s it, take the next one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The so-called comfort (means), I think everything is right. There is no &#39;strange&#39; in this scene, there is no such uncomfortable and difficult movements, behaviors, and tone. It is waves. It is a calm, still and deep expression of expression, rather than which note pops up and becomes stronger; which note becomes deeper. Maybe it is used in this movie, and the comfortable feeling is like this.&quot; Xin Baiqing said . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Being burdened with the dissatisfaction of the times and the family, in the ambiguous relationship between the sexes and the dramatic father-son relationship, the role of Gu Wentong has a lot to play. But Xin Baiqing knew that what Zhang Lu wanted was a performance that was not externalized, or even a non-acting one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;He often said that people in life are multi-faceted. You may be talking about something happily one second, but you may fall into a very self-conscious mood the next second. I don’t know why. People often get distracted and say nonsense. These are real life conditions.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This puts higher demands on performers. Not acting requires a particularly strong inner concentration, otherwise you will feel that I am wrong if I don’t act? But precisely when I don’t doubt myself and am particularly determined, another unspeakable state may arise. The audience It will be captured. If you don’t act, you may need to be more fulfilled in your heart. This enrichment does not mean that your purpose is more fulfilling, but that your past life, experience, your temperament, and the connotation of your thoughts will be felt at that moment. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 29, 2023, the closing ceremony and awards ceremony of the Beijing Film Festival was held. As Zhang Lu said, Xin Baiqing really won the award. He won the &quot;Tiantan Award&quot; for Best Actor for &quot;The Light of the White Tower&quot;. This is his first movie award. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/sD0TPDJ9dOvlC0xXjG9FRfXGk083Fk6e61ffRF8m.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;604&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/sD0TPDJ9dOvlC0xXjG9FRfXGk083Fk6e61ffRF8m.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257462&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stills from the drama &quot;Hurry Up&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Game sense &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In addition to film and television roles, Xin Baiqing has always been an actor at the National Theater. The first major theater play was director Tian Qinxin&#39;s &quot;Hurry Up&quot; (2001). He played the protagonist Tian Han. The play included self-narration that broke the fourth wall, emotions with his cousin, his wife, and his beauty, as well as several scenes in the play. For example, the Syrian boy in &quot;Salome&quot; translated by Tian Han and Guan Hanqing in the script written by Tian Han were both played by Xin Baiqing. Later, in &quot;Red Rose and White Rose&quot; (2007), he played &quot;Liu Xiahui&quot; known to all Shanghai. In &quot;Four Generations Under One Roof&quot; (2010), he played the role of Guan Xiaohe, who lives in an alley and seeks fame and wealth from the Japanese, and won the Drama Golden Lion Award for Performance. In &quot;Green Snake&quot; (2013), he played Fahai, who was both human and divine. In 2023, he will also play Su Shi in Tian Qinxin&#39;s new play &quot;Spring Dawn on Su Di&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xin Baiqing remembers the words of director Tian Qinxin, whom he has collaborated with many times: The biggest difference between drama and film and television, or the biggest charm of drama is that it can be dressed up. Movies and TV dramas won’t look for Xin Baiqing, but Tian Qinxin will. &quot;It feels very playful to dress up this character, and it makes me suddenly enlightened. It has become a fun thing. It doesn&#39;t mean that I have to go through all the trouble to create someone. The drama is as big as the sky.&quot; , such a big yoke is put on you, no.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In more than 20 years on the stage, Xin Baiqing’s roles are not many, and he can count them on two hands. Looking back now, every role has He could still recall the stories. Compared with film and television, drama is far away from fame and fortune. Xin Baiqing himself sometimes wonders why he has never left drama? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Fame and fortune may be just a moment. It&#39;s great that my play has become popular. It is recognized by so many people. I enjoy it very much, but it will pass soon. But acting in a play requires being in the rehearsal room every day. Rehearsing all the time, this kind of simple happiness is so rare. The older I get, the things, social environment, and relationships I face become more and more complicated. (Performing a play) This thing is not complicated. I can go back to simplicity If you find the place where you were when you were little, you will be particularly happy.&quot; Xin Baiqing said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;He has a very clean temperament. This kind of cleanliness is rare.&quot; Tian Qinxin said that in the rehearsal venue, she would sometimes be suddenly moved by Xin Baiqing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, the new version of &quot;Kurst&quot; was staged. Xin Baiqing went to watch it as an audience member and felt that the younger generation of actors performed better than himself. &quot;When I was young, I was a bit heartless. I just had fun and played silly every day. I didn&#39;t care about my brain and didn&#39;t take things personally. Because it would be very painful if I pretended too much, you know?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&quot;But there is no way, life is just stuffed into my arms, and I have stuffed a lot of it into my arms over the years.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What has life stuffed into him? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Fire, rice, oil and salt are all put in it. You really can&#39;t tell the details. This is living and living.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the version of &quot;Hurry&quot; played by Xin Baiqing, there is a section where Tian Han Watching a theater in Tokyo, I read a confession, to the effect that I have found my passion, just like a planet has found its orbit: &quot;I was confused when I was a child, and I probably can&#39;t understand it. I only love the color I want, I will let it pull out a track and lead me to revolve freely.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I said this line and asked Xin Baiqing if it resonated with him when he was young, but he denied it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;When I was a child, I really didn’t know what it meant. I just pronounced the word out to compose a new word to express a state of sadness. What is life, what is pulling, what is my color. , I don’t know what I want. Now that I’ve reached this age, I know everything, and I don’t need to say such words anymore. I have all the insights, but it’s been a cold autumn.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Through his works, it is difficult to trace the trajectory of his climb in performance. Nor did he give a so-called “eureka moment.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I understand your question, but there is no specific node. Because life itself has no nodes. My life is stable, but are you willing to experience the stable life with your heart? I have experienced it with my heart, age, age, and stability. What time brings to people will be subtle and accumulated little by little.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He only said that if he plays Tian Han again now, it should be different. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Blunt&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2008, when director Jiang Wei was filming &quot;Latent&quot;, his first consideration was to cast Xin Baiqing and Zhu Yuanyuan to play the roles of Yu Zecheng and Cuiping. He felt that Xin Baiqing had some Literary popularity. Unfortunately, Zhu Yuanyuan was pregnant. Jiang Wei said that Xin Baiqing could go alone, but Xin Baiqing did not go to accompany the childbirth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After &quot;Latent&quot; was aired, it became a phenomenon-level TV series, winning awards all over the country. Xin Baiqing has regrets, but not regrets. This isn&#39;t the only time I&#39;ve run into a favorite character. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The role Xin Baiqing wanted to play most was Faust. In Goethe&#39;s play &quot;Faust&quot;, the learned scholar makes a deal with the devil Mephistopheles, selling his soul in exchange for endless knowledge and wisdom, and willing to go to hell after death. Later, when someone actually approached him to play &quot;Faust&quot;, he refused. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Why didn&#39;t I act when this opportunity came to me? I struggled for a long time, and then I realized that what I wanted to act was not Goethe&#39;s Faust.&quot; He couldn&#39;t say anything. Explaining what Faust he wanted to play, he knew what he didn’t want. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I feel quite blunt, and in life I feel that I am not very bright or very smart anyway.” Xin Baiqing said of himself. But he has his own little world. When he is particularly tired, or driving in a car, he watches other people play Four Kingdoms Army Chess on the Internet. Sometimes when he sees that the game is too bad, he also says that he can’t stand it anymore, so he closes it and clicks to play it again later. &quot;Just like that, I am very happy in my heart, but when I communicate with others, I become a very boring person.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xin Baiqing likes diving. Putting his life on the bottom of the water, distracting thoughts were forced to be reduced to a minimum. The oxygen content, diving depth, and direction were all no problem. When he could finally relax and take a look at the bottom of the sea, he felt that it might be similar to the feeling of being in space, and he felt better. It becomes wider. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone who is an actor is sensitive, but sensitivity can sometimes hurt oneself. As an &quot;introvert, not good at expressing people&quot;, Xin Baiqing uses this method to let himself go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Jiahan is the producer of &quot;The Long Confession&quot; and &quot;The Light of the White Tower&quot;. She said, &quot;In real life, Teacher Bai Qing is very polite and harmonious with the crew. &quot;&quot;The Long Confession&quot; was filmed in Japan. Xin Baiqing did not understand Japanese, but &quot;will try his best to adapt and is unwilling to cause trouble to others.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;But you always feel that he has a little secret, and he just happened to find an outlet in the script.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1997, the 1993 undergraduate students of the Performance Department of the Central Academy of Drama were about to graduate and were rehearsing. During the break, a dozen classmates went to have lunch with the teacher. Walking in Dongmianhua Hutong in front of the school, the teacher asked, who among you can continue to act in dramas after graduation? The originally cheerful atmosphere suddenly became quiet. At that time, acting in a drama meant being poor, and no one said anything. Xin Baiqing added, &quot;I would be happy to act in dramas for the rest of my life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2023, Xin Baiqing will be 50 years old, and some of his teachers at that time have passed away. Whenever he rehearses a play, attends a class reunion, or visits his teacher&#39;s grave, he will recall that scene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[微短剧的“危险”狂飙]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260414]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-11 14:33:10&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Micro short dramas are booming from all levels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of market size, according to data from a third-party research report quoted by Chinese Online, the market size of short dramas in 2022 will be more than 10 billion yuan, and the scale of micro short dramas in 2023 is expected to exceed 30 billion yuan. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of market supply, according to data from the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, the number of micro-short dramas registered for the whole year in 2021 is 398, while the number of registered micro-short dramas in 2022 is close to 2,800, a year-on-year increase of 600%; March 2023 -In August, the number of national key online micro-short dramas that have been approved for planning and registration was basically over 260, and in July and August they were 361 and 401 respectively, indicating a significant increase in supply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a company perspective, Chinese Online, Huace Film and Television, Mango Super Media, Huayi Brothers, Ningmeng Film and Television, Palm Reading Technology, and Changxin Media have all increased investment in this area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But on the other side, due to the &quot;kitsch&quot; of the subject matter, the market supervision of micro-short dramas still remains uncertain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 10, Chinese Online closed at 25.40 yuan per share, a decrease of 9.19%. Previously, from November 2 to 9, the company&#39;s stock price doubled in just 6 trading days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/1dd74182eae8ccd0b188c70e077d37fa.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;562&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/1dd74182eae8ccd0b188c70e077d37fa.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257894&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;The micro-short drama &quot;Twenty-Nine&quot; starring Yang Rong has been viewed more than 800 million times on Douyin short video platform. Image source: Poster from the show&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Comfortable and Intensive&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The biggest feature of micro-short dramas is their high recycling efficiency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chinese Online, a popular micro-short drama concept stock, stated in the investor exchange minutes that short dramas are characterized by short content and a large number of episodes, usually 80-100 episodes, each episode is less than two minutes, and the plot is It has strong drama, the creative content is more in line with the needs of the masses, the story is quick to reverse, and the plot is exciting and dense. Rely more on platform advertising to reach C-end customers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On this basis, micro-short dramas have a short commercial verification cycle and high recycling efficiency. They mainly rely on advertising. As long as the streaming side can achieve the first-day recycling target, they can continue to optimize the distribution strategy. Then achieve high ROI recovery. From script polishing to filming, production, and delivery verification, a work can complete verification and closed-loop in a short time, with a high asset transfer rate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the production cycle of micro-short dramas is short, the production cost is low, and the shooting cycle is generally within a week. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“If it doesn’t work, just change the subject. The cost is too low. Just shoot for another.” A micro-short drama entrepreneur told a reporter from the 21st Century Business Herald. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This allows Chinese online, which has a weak film and television foundation, to quickly enter the core track. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The company has the advantage of massive IP. At present, short drama scripts are mainly derived from adaptations of online novels. The company has 5.5 million IPs and can continuously provide high-quality short drama IP adapted scripts, with outstanding long-term running capabilities.&quot; Chinese online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Old content giant Huace Film and Television is also rapidly entering this market. The company disclosed that it began researching the short drama track in the second half of last year and started building teams in June this year. There are currently 6 teams, and it is also introducing screenwriters, producers, and cooperating with casting companies. &quot;The future positioning is to enter the top five of micro-short dramas.&quot; Huace said. What it considers to be its advantage is obviously its production capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Objectively, film and television giants still have advantages in laying out this track. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Ningmeng Film and Television, at the beginning of 2023, its micro-short drama &quot;Twenty-Nine&quot; had a total playback volume of more than 800 million times on the Douyin short video platform, and the average playback volume of each episode exceeded 40 million times, related topics have been played a total of 1.45 billion times on the entire site, which is the highest level among Douyin short video micro-series. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But at present, the biggest feature of micro-short dramas is their &quot;refreshing feeling&quot;, and there seems to be little demand for high-quality productions. Everyone from micro-short drama entrepreneurs to middle-level executives of leading film and television companies admitted to 21st Century Business Herald reporters that the current advantages of leading film and television companies in this market are relatively limited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, after the second season of &quot;Twenty-Nine&quot; was released, it ranked TOP 1 on the most popular micro-short drama list and occupied the TOP 1 spot on Douyin&#39;s micro-short drama list for 5 consecutive weeks. However, the popularity has dropped significantly compared to the first season. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Platform Changes&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Behind the popular short drama is a lonely long video. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many project leaders of film and television companies lamented to reporters from the 21st Century Business Herald that as platforms “reduce costs and increase efficiency,” it is becoming increasingly difficult to make money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The financial report shows that iQiyi’s content costs in 2022 will be 16.5 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 20%. In addition, the company is also promoting self-produced dramas. At present, the proportion of iQiyi’s self-made content assets continues to rise, from 32% in 2018 to 63% in 2022. iQiyi also revealed that among the new key dramas released every year, the proportion of original content will increase from 20% in 2018 to more than 50% in 2022. All of the above have squeezed the profit margins of film and television projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The incentive for this change is the fragile profit model of long videos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the second quarter of this year, iQiyi’s revenue was 7.802 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 17.2%; net profit attributable to the parent company was 365 million yuan, compared with a net loss of 214 million yuan in the same period last year. But from a quarter-on-quarter perspective, iQiyi’s revenue is in a declining range. Driven by &quot;Hurricane&quot;, in the first quarter, its revenue reached 8.349 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 15%; the net profit attributable to the parent company was 618.1 million yuan, while the net profit in the same period last year was 169.1 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why the performance of long video is so volatile is that user demand is becoming fragmented and the monetization efficiency is relatively low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Analysys Qianfan data, in September 2023, iQiyi’s monthly active users dropped to 568.67 million, and Tencent Video’s monthly active users dropped to 450.17 million. During the same period, Douyin’s monthly active users dropped to 797.67 million, and Kuaishou’s monthly active users dropped to 522.36 million. The difference between long and short videos is obvious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, from the perspective of advertising, advertisers are rushing to short videos due to higher monetization efficiency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiangpiaopiao disclosed that in the first half of the year, its frozen lemon tea sales increased by 547.09% year-on-year, and its online channels increased by 235% year-on-year. Douyin channels accounted for about 30%, and the cumulative repurchase rate remained high. Jinzai Food also stated that in terms of online channels, the company’s new media channels such as Douyin performed well, with a year-on-year increase of approximately 600%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person in charge of the marketing department of a leading beverage company told a reporter from the 21st Century Business Herald that compared with long video platforms such as iQiyi, short videos have a more direct marketing effect and are much more efficient in monetization. “There are basically no big expectations for the monetization of long videos,” he said. Another founder of outdoor sports products also expressed similar views. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the double attack of traffic and revenue, the long video ecology is moving towards the stock market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a result, content companies have to rush to micro-short dramas. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Uncertainty&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;However, the micro-short drama market is also facing various problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A large number of film and television companies and even platforms are currently unwilling to be too high-profile in this business. The core lies in the policy instability of micro-short dramas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The standardized supervision of short dramas can be traced back to August 2020. The State Administration of Radio, Film and Television has added a rapid registration and filing module for online micro-short dramas to the key online film and television drama information filing system, marking the official inclusion of micro-short dramas into the supervision system. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2022, the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television issued a document clarifying that the review of domestic online dramas, including short plays, will be included in the management of administrative licensing matters, and it is necessary to obtain a distribution license from the relevant radio and television administrative departments before they can be broadcast and released; In November, we issued an article to carry out special rectification of mini-program micro-drama. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While guiding the standardized development, the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television also provides necessary support to short plays. In December 2022, the &quot;Opinions on Promoting the Prosperous Development of Short Play Creation&quot; proposed to cultivate and expand the main body of short play creation. Provide tilted support to short plays in terms of resources, talents, marketing, broadcasting, and publicity. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It must be noted that at present, cool dramas are still the mainstream in the market. According to Juduo Engine, the core of current short dramas is &quot;cool&quot;, and 90% of the themes are based on &quot;cool&quot;. There are various ways to be cool, including God of War, time travel, counterattack, rebirth and other themes. As a result, there is a tendency of &quot;kitsch&quot;. According to a reporter from the 21st Century Business Herald, regulators are paying close attention to a large amount of &quot;edge&quot; content. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The market direction is full of uncertainty.” Many upstream and downstream participants in the industry stated this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, from the perspective of market size, micro-short dramas are still limited compared to long videos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, iQiyi alone’s revenue will reach 29 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 5%. This data far exceeds the overall market size of micro-short dramas in the same year and is close to the expected size of micro-short dramas in 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, there are three main types of terminal profits from short dramas. They provide membership payment, advertising monetization and e-commerce delivery respectively. Membership payment includes regular membership fees and the purchase of a single drama. The monthly membership price for mainstream long-form video platforms is 22-25 yuan, and the membership fee for short-drama exclusive platforms is higher, around 30 yuan; the single-drama payment standard is 1-25 yuan. 3 yuan/episode, and a single episode of popular dramas can cost up to 10 yuan. Advertising revenue is also an important part of short drama revenue, including pre-roll advertising, ad placement, and IP authorized marketing. Among them, pre-roll advertising is exclusive to long video platforms, and soft advertising placement is a common method for short video platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Overall, this profit model still tends to be short-term and fast, and is still far from a truly mature business model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 14:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[此情可待成追忆：本师吴金华先生逝世十年祭]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260212]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-11 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/08/xJaaVqlw63PvYAuRlUUy4wQFy4drzzlOu07pkyhn.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;864&quot; height=&quot;648&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/xJaaVqlw63PvYAuRlUUy4wQFy4drzz lOu07pkyhn. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257543&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Mr. Wu Jinhua, Distinguished Professor of Fudan University and Researcher of the Institute of Ancient Books (1943-2013) 2007 Photos taken during his visit to the United States in December. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of He Lingxia)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1997, nine years had passed since I graduated from Nanjing Normal University with an undergraduate degree in ancient literature. One spring afternoon, I went up to the fourth floor with my four-year-old daughter in my arms. When I took out the key and opened the door, I woke up from my own heavy breathing. Because I was unwilling to let my life go down, I decided to go back to college to start another kind of growth. At that moment, I thought of you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, after graduating from college, I stopped thinking about you for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I saw you in college, you had a bald head like a European monk, energetic eyes behind big glasses, and thick lips that were always smiling. Except in summer, he seems to always wear a blue or black tunic suit with one or two pens in the top pocket. A classmate from the previous class said that they saw you wiping the blackboard with the sleeves of your Mao suit while you were engaged in class. We didn’t take your class very often, so we never saw you do this in class, but I did see you darken your face after class. The corners, cuffs, pockets, etc. of the tunic suit looked like they were stained with chalk dust. I was admitted to Nanjing Normal University in 1984. The various inexplicable and severe restrictions I had suffered before led to strong rebellion in the tolerant university. During those four years, I couldn’t see anything, including you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As graduation approaches, my view of you has changed a lot. I went to your home to receive guidance on my graduation thesis. That was the only individual communication in the past four years. The house was very crowded and there was no desk, so you invited me to sit down at a small round dining table filled with books and started talking about my thesis. During this period, I have been attracted by a copy of &quot;The Anthology of the Three Kingdoms&quot; spread out in the middle of the table. The blank space on the opened page is filled with long and short school slogans written in different pens. When you talk about it later, you forget why, as if you are looking for an example to illustrate, you start to flip through the book. Then I saw clearly that every page of the book was filled with colorful words. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/AvnX5ym43zUn0CFTMDMl2eAOkOZRhgh5Toicl6Pv.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1045&quot; height= &quot;780&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/AvnX5ym43zUn0CFTMDMl2eAOkOZRhgh5Toicl6Pv.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257546&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Anthology of the Three Kingdoms&quot; annotated by Mr. Wu Jinhua. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by He Lingxia)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am very ashamed. What you talked to me about academics that day was quickly forgotten. Only the appearance of this book still comes to mind from time to time. After graduating from Nanjing Normal University, I returned to my hometown of Changshu. After only a year or two, my arrogance naturally turned into decadence. In the next few years, I rarely read. When the weather is bad, I wander aimlessly by Shang Lake at the foot of Yushan Mountain, letting the rain and snow fall from my head. Try to persuade yourself and try to play cards day and night with all kinds of people from all walks of life. Smoking more and more aggressively, especially when alone. I often drank, got drunk late at night, and sat alone in the darkness on the side of the road, crying silently. It wasn&#39;t until this spring afternoon that everything came to an abrupt end. I decided to start over and do something seriously for a long time. What came to mind again at that time was the &quot;Anthology of the Three Kingdoms&quot; filled with words. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So I wrote to you. I didn’t even know that you left Suiyuan two years ago (Editor’s note: the former site of Yuan Mei Suiyuan, the old campus of Nanjing Normal University). Your reply from Shanghai said that it was a pleasure to know that you wanted to come to study. Professionally, as long as we don&#39;t completely abandon what we have learned and review it, not many people can compete. What you have to do is to concentrate on preparing foreign languages. In the winter of that year, in the last two months before the postgraduate entrance examination, it seemed to be raining all the time. I locked myself in a room, lowered the curtains, put away the clock, and read, recited, and dictated, day and night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first time I came to your home after being admitted to Fudan University, you came out of the study. Because you still retained the memories from ten years ago, you looked much older and had less hair, but your eyes Still energetic. I said, I came too late, I should have come ten years ago. You immediately said with a smile on your face, it&#39;s not too late, I just started at your age. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first year, you asked me to translate the papers of Japanese scholars in conjunction with foreign language learning. Before submitting the completed translation, you asked me to write a translator&#39;s note. For those few hundred words of notes, you revised it four or five times. Through repeated frustrations, I began to slowly understand what &quot;negative rhetoric&quot; is. When you finally changed the schedule, you smiled and said gently that it seemed that you had been away from school for too long and you were no longer in the mood. But it doesn’t matter, just start slowly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the first school year, you asked me to go to the library to borrow different versions of &quot;Jiankang Records&quot; and use my summer vacation time to do the revision. After school started, I reported the findings of the review to you, and you seemed very happy. I remember when my wife came over to pour us water, you turned around and said to your wife seriously, &quot;Ji Zhongping is very attentive. I have read this book so many times, but I didn&#39;t see many of the problems he found.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/TwzgBI2zDO3U2Oc4bzNaQFJrUsHg4ccOFXYQFWid.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;843&quot; height= &quot;723&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/TwzgBI2zDO3U2Oc4bzNaQFJrUsHg4ccOFXYQFWid.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257544&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Qing Yi Xun Tang published &quot;Jiankang Record&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I came to Fudan again to study for a Ph.D., it was the first time I talked about choosing a doctoral thesis topic. You introduced what you discovered. A category of words created using classic sentences. I blurted out that the use of such words should be to make the rhetoric more elegant. After hearing this, you patted your thigh with an exaggerated movement that was completely beyond my expectation and said, Great, this understanding is great, this is your invention. Well, let&#39;s call this type of words Yayan words, and you can do this topic. The next day, I went to class in the liberal arts building and saw my senior who had just finished class and said to me, the teacher said in class that you have an important invention. A few days later, I met a friend from East China Normal University and told me that Teacher Wu went to their school for a meeting and said at the meeting that I had an amazing invention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In those years when I was studying at Fudan, after having long conversations with you, on the way back to school late at night, I would always stand up and pedal my bike hard, eager to sit down at my desk the next second. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was a teenager, I read books such as &quot;The Detectives of Sherlock Holmes&quot; and &quot;Three Heroes and Five Righteousnesses&quot;. I imagined that when I grew up, I could become a detective who pursues the truth and an impartial judge. However, I realized that this was unrealistic when I became an adult. . You taught me how to do collation and exegesis, and how to make reliable inferences through thorough investigation and meticulous analysis. I will pursue the truth relentlessly and base myself on the facts without any compromise. Everything depends on me. Discovering a typo is like exposing a villain; restoring an original word is like clearing up an unjust case. Sitting at my desk late at night, I felt like Sherlock Holmes sitting in a carriage on his way to investigate a case, or like Bao Zheng sitting in the lobby of the Kaifeng government office. I don’t have any great talents to gain wealth in the world, nor do I have any ambition to achieve greatness in the world. When I come to this world, I have to live in a certain way. If I can live my life with this feeling besides being harmless to humans and animals. I have been content for the rest of my life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I remember one time, when I said goodbye to you and said I was leaving because a friend had an appointment to play football, you asked me, does football really fascinate you so much? At the time I just said yes. I didn&#39;t tell you that day why I never tire of football, because it was the only relatively fair game I could participate in. On our court, there are only simple and clear rules, relying only on one&#39;s own skills and efforts, everything is under the sun, and all power and influence are meaningless. I don&#39;t know any skills other than poetry, I just like to participate in this kind of game with my own ability and enthusiasm. Only this kind of game can allow me to truly feel the joy of life, even though no one cheers, there is no income, and there is even the risk of breaking my muscles and bones at any time. I am very superficial, and my understanding of knowledge is no different from playing football. Although I still play football twice a week to this day, I know very well that in my lifetime, my strength and speed will gradually fade away. One day, I will no longer be able to run as much as I want on the court. However, even then, , I can still continue to experience the same fun on my desk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I first met you, I brought you some tea. You told me seriously that this would never happen again. We don’t need this when we get along. If you can write an article and show it to me, that would be better than giving me anything. From then on, all I can think of in return is to write something to you. In the days I spent with you, I don’t remember saying any words of gratitude in front of you in a serious manner. You passed away suddenly in June 2013. I rushed back to Shanghai from Kyoto. I came down from your house alone late that night and sat in the small garden next to the building. I regretted that I had not had time to say many things to you in person. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don’t know if we can meet again in another world in the future. If not, then we will never have the chance to say those words in person, so I have no choice but to write the above words. Although It&#39;s just a very small part of it. If you have a soul, you will surely understand what I mean. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/308zXIMnik3dYv81fwpnBsMOKS9TN8ELyu6dHtcC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1242&quot; height= &quot;847&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/308zXIMnik3dYv81fwpnBsMOKS9TN8ELyu6dHtcC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257545&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wu Jinhua and Mr. Jao Tsung-I (left), taken in 1993. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by He Lingxia)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to gratitude, there is also an apology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although my lifestyle has changed completely since I came to Fudan to study, some of the beliefs I formed since I was a student at Nanjing Normal University have not changed. Those beliefs may just be a joke in the eyes of others today, but I am willing to stick to them for life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was studying for a master&#39;s degree at Fudan University, the Institute of Ancient Books Collation held a meeting for students to evaluate scholarships. The meeting had a section that was equivalent to self-declaration. The students who spoke in front talked about what they had done and what they had published, and they talked very enthusiastically. Although I have done some research and published papers in journals, I cannot speak like they did. Seeing that it was almost my turn, I stood up quickly, picked up the blank form that was given to me, handed it to the teacher who was hosting the meeting, and said that I was ashamed and felt that I could not compare with them, so I quit first. The next day, you called my dormitory and told me seriously that as long as you applied, you would have won at least the second prize. This is very important, don’t do this next time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To this day, I still don’t think this is important. My idea is very simple, because I didn’t win this award, I got through with it. What kind of honor can there be for an award that requires application only? After the doctoral thesis was written, you told me twice that after the defense, we would go to the Academy of Social Sciences to apply for the Lu Shuxiang Award, or go to Peking University to apply for the Wang Li Award. The first time I pretended not to hear, but the second time I told you clearly that I would not apply. When I was studying for a PhD at Fudan University, I won the highest award in liberal arts, but I never thought about applying. You applied privately on my behalf. You suddenly called me after 11 o&#39;clock the next night and told me that you had applied for me, and now you only need me to go to the award meeting the next day to make an introduction. I hesitated for a while and reluctantly agreed. Of course I know this is all your hard work, and I really can&#39;t bear to disobey you late at night. The next day I only used half of the allotted time and ended my uncomfortable self-cutting hastily. When I left the venue, I felt relaxed all over. I didn&#39;t care whether I won an award or not. I just felt that I had gone through this process, which was more or less an explanation to you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although I like football very much, I rarely take the initiative to ask people to play football. Because I don&#39;t like others to accompany me reluctantly because of my invitation. I don’t like the state of being in my heart but not in my heart, and I certainly don’t want my friends to be like this. The games we play are just a bunch of ragtag games, but everyone is united physically and mentally. It is a game without any dirty things other than football. Although my technical level is limited, I thought I was enjoying the real joy of gaming. Any association with anything other than football would probably make me feel uncomfortable. It makes me feel a little sad to think that one day we all in this world will inevitably end in clouds and rain. However, I am not depressed at all when I think that all the hard work I have done will eventually be wiped out. Every run, every pass, every shot, while doing your best, the fun is in it. The moment I came off the field, I had finished enjoying football. In the days to come, if you tell me how I was in that game, I actually feel nothing. I rarely remember what kind of goals I have scored, even if they were just played yesterday. What I never forget every day is just where to start the next game. I have little knowledge and cannot give any lofty meaning to my profession. I just hope that the research I engage in can be as pure as football. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/VRZYDxiw00rhnLfbpNMeNxJZTtpKlMrnQUwItYFq.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;531&quot; height= &quot;742&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/VRZYDxiw00rhnLfbpNMeNxJZTtpKlMrnQUwItYFq.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257542&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wu Jinhua graduated from the Chinese Department of Nanjing Normal University in 1966.

After graduating in 1981, he stayed at the school to teach. In 1986, he won the second prize of the Young Linguist Award of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

During this period, you asked me if I have any requirements for my workplace after graduation. I said it didn&#39;t matter to me, as long as I had a bite to eat. You said, then see if you are willing to stay. I said of course that&#39;s good, so I can always be by your side. Then you said that you believed that I would have no problems with my business, but you hoped that I could do some things outside of business to ensure that I could stay. I told you on the spot that I didn&#39;t want to. I just wanted to make a living based on my own ability. You mentioned it twice after that, and I explicitly rejected it both times. The last time, I even said that if I had to do that to stay, then I would go somewhere else. If I have to do academic work that way, then I would rather live on the streets pulling a cart and carrying bags. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I know that&#39;s arrogant and rude to say. In fact, I have never seen and can&#39;t imagine anyone talking to you like that. Of course I fully understand that you have my life in mind, but if I do what you say, I will have trouble sleeping at night. These beliefs have been rooted in my heart since I was a teacher in Nanjing. They are the promises I made to myself. Even when I was dissolute, I never violated them at all. Perhaps, for others, there shouldn&#39;t be any doubts about doing something like that, because everyone does it, but I am me, and in my opinion, no matter how many people do it, it is impossible to change this kind of thing. nature, I cannot deceive myself, so I am willing to accept the life I choose. I think if the research we did is credible, it must be the only judgment made based on real materials and strict logic. The beliefs I adhere to are the same kind of non-dual judgment. It is impossible for me to change because of the intervention of anyone other than facts and logic, not even you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You are very strict with students. My wife once told me privately that even several older doctoral students were scolded by you until they cried in front of them. I don’t know why you are so tolerant to me. You have never spoken harshly, so that I have the confidence to speak freely in front of you again and again, especially for those beliefs that are ridiculous in the eyes of others, but you always smile gently and make some remarks. Advice, and ultimately make it clear that you respect my choice. I admit that if you were still alive, I still would not apologize to you for things like the above. Because although I am stubborn, during the time when I was studying with you, I regarded you as the judge of this world to a certain extent. I need to state the facts clearly to you, and then get a fair ruling from you. . It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t respect you, but I&#39;m afraid that my apology will change your original decision. In my opinion, such a change of judgment, even if it is beneficial to me, no longer has the meaning of a ruling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It has been ten years since you went to another world, and I no longer need you to make any judgments. Therefore, please accept my apology now. I apologize to you for all my past arrogance. Apologize. Forgive me, more than 20 years ago, I just wanted to go back to the peach blossom land I once had. I didn’t know it at that time. Things have changed, and the place I yearned for has already kept pace with the times. But I have always been like that warrior who is searching for a sword, stubbornly guarding that place. mark. Forgive me, I don’t want to live just for food, that’s no different than a dolphin or a dog. I want a life with wine. The gentle smile you show in the face of those unbridled smiles is a great comfort to an inappropriately lonely student. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People often say that once you are a teacher, you will always be a father. This is just a matter of etiquette, because how much emotion can be created in a day&#39;s interaction. Deep feelings are the accumulation of emotions generated after long-term mutual understanding. I know there are teachers who are different from you, but for more than ten years, you are the only one to me. To this day, I still feel lucky that on that spring afternoon twenty-six years ago, when I said goodbye to comfort and wanted to start another kind of growth, you adopted me, just like a father. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[药品集采12小时：“割肉”也不想丢标]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260396]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-11 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http:// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/10/2bf7fc80a8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/23/11/10/2bf7fc80a8.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257839&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: justify;&quot;>;This collective purchase 41 types of drugs were successfully purchased, and the prices of the selected drugs were reduced by an average of 58%, the second largest price reduction in history.

I personally think it will prompt companies to further lower their quotations.&quot; A representative of a pharmaceutical company from Shangqiu, Henan told a reporter from Southern Weekend that the company is It was my first time to participate in the national centralized drug procurement, and I started preparing for this round of application since passing the consistency evaluation half a year ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Starting at eight o&#39;clock, business representatives poured into the first floor of the conference center. Within 12 hours, a total of 382 products from 262 companies participated in the bidding.

Although these companies themselves are not participating in this collective purchase, they are also looking forward to the results of the ninth batch of collective purchases, especially if they can collide with some cooperation opportunities with the selected pharmaceutical companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;At about 19:00 on November 6, the National Medical Insurance Administration announced that 41 types of drugs were successfully purchased in this centralized purchase, and the average price of the selected drugs was reduced by 58%.

How big the volume is? Secondly, it depends on the market capacity of the province. Thirdly, it depends on the importance that enterprises attach to different regions. For example, enterprises tend to choose Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou to enhance brand awareness.

Lin Mei was lying on the hospital bed with her eyes open and her face pale. She was soon sent to the intensive care unit (ICU). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At noon that day, Lin Mei had cut the vegetables. The message pushed by the Tmall APP on her mobile phone showed that the plasticine purchased online for her son had arrived at the Cainiao Station near the community. She put down the kitchen knife, casually wore a pair of jeans and a pair of white sandals, and took her son out to pick up the express delivery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If everything goes well, she will pick up the express delivery and return home in 10 minutes and prepare lunch. They had just moved into this new house, and the developer called the couple to apply for a real estate certificate together. Unfortunately, the housing management center was off work at that time, and they agreed to do it as soon as they got back from a business trip. She and her husband are high school classmates. They have known each other for 20 years and been married for more than ten years. After working hard together, they finally have a car, a house and a 10-year-old son. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/XDoKyf0VCRkVxzDMXS5GOeXxesJwNDsQkEqXLNLT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;540&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/XDoKyf0VCRkVxzDMXS5GOeXxesJwNDsQkEqXLNLT.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257424&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The first floor of the station is a convenience store, and the second floor is the Cainiao Station&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by respondent)&lt;/span>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen from the later surveillance video that when picking up the parcel, Lin Mei was looking at the pickup code on her mobile phone while looking for the express delivery on the shelf. She did not notice at all that there was an open hole under her feet. , she unfortunately fell into the hole at her feet while looking sideways for the courier. The opening is usually used by the boss to load and unload goods. The height from the opening on the second floor to the ground on the first floor is 2.8 meters. The opening should usually be closed, but it was not closed in time when the incident occurred. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This Cainiao Station uses a steel frame and steel plate structure to divide the space of a shop into two floors. The first floor is a convenience store selling fruits and vegetables, and the second floor is for express delivery. You usually need to go to the second floor to find the items. Self-service scan code pickup. The express delivery station and the convenience store have the same owner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the owner of the inn, he once fell from the entrance of the cave. At that time, he accidentally dodged and fell. He only injured his leg and rested for a while. &quot;He had psychological defenses, but my wife didn&#39;t have any psychological defenses. She was completely confused when she fell and had no idea what happened.&quot; Zhang Xiang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/kfdZphizaHPVMJWTrk5cPH6efEvZRCli8mSXPNIH.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;540&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/kfdZphizaHPVMJWTrk5cPH6efEvZRCli8mSXPNIH.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257427&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Lin Mei in the hospital bed&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Outside the ICU door, Zhang Xiang wrote a few lines of note about &quot;Don&#39;t think about it&quot; and asked the nurse to send it in. He also added in the blank space of the paper &quot;You can visit at five o&#39;clock every afternoon&quot;, drew two smiling faces, and included a pen for him to send in. Lin Mei can write something. When the note was sent out later, it was wet and there was no writing on it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After his vital signs stabilized, he underwent three surgeries in succession, and various complications occurred, including pneumonia, urinary system infection, pressure ulcers, and blood clots. &quot;The four major complications accounted for all, and there were new ones every day. Challenge.&quot; Zhang Xiang lost more than ten kilograms in more than a month. &quot;It&#39;s so painful!&quot; He described that the filter to treat blood clots was implanted into the blood vessel from the thigh when it was made, and was removed from the neck when it was removed. come out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first major surgery was cervical spine surgery, and Zhang Xiang was deeply impressed. He remembered that when Lin Mei came out of the operating room, she was lying down with a relaxed expression and a smile on her face, &quot;Because I felt that the operation was finally completed, and I felt that it might be very promising and that she might be cured soon.&quot; Later, like this The smiles are getting fewer and fewer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Yu, the attending physician at the Rehabilitation Medicine Department of the Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, told Southern People Weekly that during the fall, Lin Mei hit her head on the side wall and suffered a cervical vertebra fracture. Partial spinal cord injury, resulting in quadriplegia. The lower limbs are completely immobile and the upper limbs have very little movement. There is a loss of sensation and movement in the legs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/JVTErMkRdKzy4ydSv204lcLnYPl29jUPLU2h6P5Y.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/JVTErMkRdKzy4ydSv204lcLnYPl29jUPLU2h6P5Y.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257428&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A note written by Zhang Xiang when Lin Mei was in the ICU&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;He explained that the cervical spinal cord is a part of the brain tissue that extends from the brainstem to the spinal canal of the body. After injury, it is not controlled by the brainstem, so symptoms of paralysis will occur. Spinal cord injury results in a loss of the ability to transmit sensations to the brain, resulting in abnormalities in lower-level neurons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The doctor asked us to prepare for the worst.&quot; Zhang Xiang said, &quot;It&#39;s too painful. If cancer is a death sentence, spinal cord injury is equivalent to Ling Chi.&quot; Lin Mei was unable to turn over on her own, and even He cannot move his toes, only pathological twitching, unable to control his nerves voluntarily, has no sweating function, and cannot sense cold or heat. She would suddenly shiver but not feel cold. Sometimes I feel very cold, like being in a world of ice and snow, but actually the quilt covers me well. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My upper limbs have little strength and I cannot hold the dishes, so I can only feed him. Zhang Xiang rented a house near the hospital and cooked for his wife. His family members and caregivers took turns taking care of him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Yu said that there is very little hope of recovery from complete spinal cord injury, and there is almost no hope of recovery. &quot;Lin Mei is currently in a state of complete injury. It is very difficult to recover both legs, but we cannot make a conclusion on the time. Our hospital usually takes about 3 months. If the signs and symptoms are still the same after 3 months , you can draw a conclusion.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, Lin Mei’s cumulative treatment expenses have exceeded 180,000 yuan, and there will be many expenses in the future. After many communications, Cainiao has only paid 20,000 yuan so far, and the owner of Cainiao Station has paid 35,000 yuan. For more than a month after the incident, the rookie inn was still operating normally, and even the hole was still in use. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An accident that should not have happened completely changed the fate of a family and the life of a 37-year-old woman. Her son had just entered the fifth grade of elementary school, and she might be in a hospital bed for the rest of her life. spend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The accident exposed many hidden dangers of the express delivery station model. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Dangerous Occurrence: How does Cainiao Station operate? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The owner of a rookie inn in a county told &quot;Southern People Weekly&quot; that his store was opened two years ago, and there are two relatives in the store to help. &quot;For a normal inn, two or three people are enough.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;According to his description, Cainiao does not charge a franchise fee, and the initial investment to open a Cainiao Station is not high: you need to purchase scanners, workbenches, cloud monitoring, shelves and other equipment from the Cainiao official website, and the cost is about 1 About 10,000 yuan; plus the 3,000 yuan deposit, store rent, and water and electricity bills, the cost of opening a rookie post station is basically about 30,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of store review, “You need to submit an application online after looking at the place and house. The store’s requirements are not strict. After the application is completed, they will come over to see it. Then go directly to the courier or courier company. The person in charge of the area can negotiate the price.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The income source of the post station is mainly cooperation with the express company, and the express company pays the delivery fee and mailing income to the owner of the post station. The official website of Cainiao Station shows that the delivery fee for each express delivery is 0.5-1 yuan, and the shipping income is 3-5 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rapid coverage of the post station model is also related to the intensifying price war in the express delivery industry. When express delivery companies trade price for scale, profits will inevitably be affected, resulting in lower outlet delivery fees and further compression of profit margins. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to save the cost of terminal distribution in the &quot;last mile&quot;, express delivery stations came into being. Survey data from the China Logistics Association shows that terminal distribution costs account for more than 30% of the total costs in the logistics industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Jun was once a self-operated express delivery outlet operator under an e-commerce platform, responsible for the &quot;last mile&quot; end delivery. &quot;The company has indeed made a lot of money.&quot; She mentioned that the express delivery company is responsible for renting houses. Fees, electricity and water bills, and free computer equipment and camera installation. The basic salary of three people at the outlet needs to be paid. In addition, the delivery fee for each express item needs to be paid. The operator only needs to pay a deposit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She and her relatives have been operating the outlet for about 6 years, and the delivery fee has gradually decreased from 4 yuan at the earliest to 1.5 yuan and 1 yuan. In this store, two people are responsible for delivering express delivery, and one person is responsible for guarding the store, responsible for dividing items, sending express delivery, and handling returns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They will deliver the goods to each customer&#39;s door and call them one by one. At around 4 o&#39;clock in the morning, I need to get up and go to the highway intersection to pick up the express delivery, and then come back to unload the goods and scan the code to separate the parcels. Every day&#39;s parcels must be delivered on the same day. When facing consumers directly, you will encounter various situations. If you want to do this job well, you must have a strong sense of service. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, the e-commerce platform shut down its self-operated express delivery company due to high logistics costs, and Chen Jun stopped operating it. &quot;Compared with the ones we did before, this express delivery station model does save a lot of costs for the express delivery company and saves the energy of the courier, but it is not as convenient for users as before.&quot; The express delivery company is fully responsible for end-of-line delivery , it became the inn owner who was responsible for his own profits and losses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Competition in the industry is fierce, and there are more and more brands of express delivery stations, such as Jitu Express Station, Yuantong Mama Station, Zhongtong Tuxi Life... There will even be multiple express stations in one community. Some netizens use their own Complaints from experience: &quot;Because the community is relatively large, I picked up 6 parcels from 6 different stations.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Delivery fees also continue to fall. Two rookie station owners interviewed by &quot;Southern People Weekly&quot; Said that in their area, the delivery fees are only 0.3 yuan and 0.5 yuan per order respectively, which are both lower than the prices a few years ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The Cainiao Station in my community has changed seven or eight owners in the past two years.” A netizen said that the transfer fee of this kind of station is generally not low. &quot;Po Lee&quot; situation - the money earned from operating the inn is not as much as the transfer fee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this time, running a side business becomes an option that can increase your income source. According to the official website of Cainiao Station, it mentioned in the introduction &quot;How does Cainiao Station make money?&quot; In addition to the stable fee income, relying on the fixed flow of people brought by the station, it can run side businesses, sell daily necessities, fast-selling products, etc. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the problem is that, as a high-frequency life scenario, express delivery service is the critical &quot;last mile&quot;. If the shop owner cannot invest enough energy, it will be difficult to ensure service quality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This was the case at the rookie station where Lin Mei had an accident. In this store, the post station has become a side business, and the main business is a fruit and vegetable supermarket. &quot;Since everyone is coming, this is a natural drainage channel, so they put the fruits and vegetables on the first floor, and pick up express delivery on the second floor, and it is self-service.&quot; Zhang Xiang mentioned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/N3z3pDzDqzSqcLFYMT3B9xY3ASxWwAn28ViUOJQ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;540&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/N3z3pDzDqzSqcLFYMT3B9xY3ASxWwAn28ViUUOJQ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257426&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Drilling &quot;holes&quot; privately in the steel frame structure poses safety risks. The &quot;hole&quot; was open at the time of the incident, and Lin Mei fell out of it &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The criticized franchise Model and legal risks&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Data from the State Post Bureau show that from 2010 to 2022, my country’s express delivery business volume increased 47.3 times. The rapid development of e-commerce has brought huge demand growth to the express delivery industry. The express delivery station model came into being. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;JD.com has built its own logistics since 2007, and has won a reputation among customers with its high-quality services. Alibaba is well aware that the cost of building its own logistics is high. In order to improve the platform&#39;s express delivery service quality, it joined forces with retail, real estate, logistics and other companies to build the Cainiao Network in 2013. Its model is relatively light and it is positioned as the &quot;data hub&quot; in the logistics system. &quot;, that is, a logistics platform that adopts a franchise model. Cainiao Company does not bear the specific operating costs of the station. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, Jack Ma also stated that he would &quot;definitely not do logistics.&quot; This played a role in the development of Taobao and Tmall and in wooing logistics companies, allowing him to further control the logistics sector. Cainiao has both the traffic provided by Alibaba e-commerce and a stable logistics and distribution network. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Alibaba’s 2023 fiscal year annual report, Cainiao Group has become the fastest-growing business within Alibaba Group, with revenue of 55.681 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 21%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 26, 2023, Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Co., Ltd. officially submitted a listing application to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, becoming the first business group to officially start the IPO process since Alibaba’s “1+6+N” organizational reform . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eight years ago, Cainiao launched the first &quot;Cainiao Station&quot; to provide express delivery services in Wuhu, Anhui. The prospectus shows that Cainiao now has more than 380 logistics distribution centers and 170,000 post stations around the world. It operates the world&#39;s largest Cainiao post station network and handles more than 80 million packages per day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This franchise model has also attracted controversy. Its original intention is to provide consumers with diversified last-mile services and improve distribution efficiency, but it is also very easy to shirk responsibility from each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After all, the courier company is only responsible for the step to the post station, and the post station directly makes money from the courier company, not from the consumers. There is no direct transaction relationship between the rookie and the consumer. . Cainiao has brand influence, but it is difficult to strictly supervise each franchise station, so it is difficult for customers to obtain a better service experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The express delivery station model itself also has certain legal risks. Article 25 of the &quot;Interim Regulations on Express Delivery&quot; issued by the State Council in 2018 stipulates that enterprises engaged in express delivery business shall deliver express delivery to the agreed address, recipient or recipient designated by the recipient, and notify the recipient or The recipient shall accept the goods in person. The recipient or agent has the right to accept the goods in person. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, in the post mode, it is difficult to deliver goods to your door. The owner of the Cainiao Station in the above-mentioned county said that there are indeed many requests for door-to-door delivery. &quot;Everyone can deliver it. Now if the station does not deliver, it may fall on the courier company. The express company will ask the courier to deliver it to him, and then he will complain later.&quot; There will be a fine if you use the post station.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, on social platforms, some users said, &quot;It is useless to complain. You will be blacklisted by the post station, and you will not be included in the warehouse in the future. You will have to return it from the post station every time. When you go to an express delivery outlet, your delivery will always be slower than others. Currently, there is no effective method.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Yinggang, a partner at Jingheng Law Firm, told Southern People Weekly that without Consumers agree that express delivery companies have no right to put goods purchased by consumers into express delivery stations. The e-commerce contract signed by consumers through the Internet stipulates that the purchased goods will be delivered to the designated address with free shipping or payment of postage. &quot;If the express delivery company changes the delivery location or delivery method without the consent of the consumer, it will constitute a breach of contract. They should be responsible for continuing to perform the contract or other remedies, and bear liability for breach of contract.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The consequences of the safety hazards caused by poor supervision of the station are even more serious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the official website of Cainiao Post, the specific requirements for the post store are: located on the first floor (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;parallel to the road&lt;/span >;), there is no floor limit for office buildings and commercial buildings. However, the station where Lin Mei&#39;s accident occurred did not comply with this requirement and built a steel frame structure privately, and was not subject to supervision and rectification by Cainiao Company during its operating hours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Consumers have absolutely no idea what the relationship is between the head office and the outlets. They only know that Cainiao is a big company. Going to pick up packages is completely the information pushed to us by Tmall’s backend. This is a public operation. place, but there was no safety guarantee at all, which led to the tragedy.&quot; Zhang Xiang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Yinggang said that in the Lin Mei incident, &quot;In the case of franchising, from the perspective of consumer protection, and based on franchising, the franchisor and the franchise store should bear joint and several liability to the outside world. The owner of the station If its own negligence or fault causes harm to others during the service process, the liability for compensation cannot generally be exempted. Without the consent of the consumer, the express delivery company should also bear joint tort liability.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; h4>;After the Fall&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Wake up every day is the most painful moment for Zhang Xiang. Do you think this is true? If only it were a dream. But the reality is so cruel and real. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But he needs to cheer up and comfort his lover when she is depressed and breaks down crying. He read Su Dongpo&#39;s poems and Shi Tiesheng&#39;s articles to Lin Mei by the bedside, telling her that a person&#39;s destiny cannot be perfect and there will always be some ups and downs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For more than two months, Lin Mei has been lying in the ward most of the time. Occasionally, she can see the clouds outside the window. &quot;Look, there are more and more clouds outside.&quot; She looked at the clouds, Tell Zhang Xiang. This reminded him of an ordinary day in the past. When the two of them were walking together, Lin Mei would say: &quot;Look at the clouds in the sky. In fact, let&#39;s take a walk outside together, look at the clouds in the sky, and enjoy the beautiful scenery of nature.&quot; The wind is very happy.&quot; Zhang Xiang said, &quot;Now that I think about it, I was the happiest at that time, but I didn&#39;t think so at that time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Zhang Xiang&#39;s eyes, Lin Mei is a very simple and knowledgeable person. The person who runs the house, she is the only one who knows where everything in the house is. Just after the accident, Zhang Xiang stayed home for one night, but &quot;I couldn&#39;t sleep at all. I felt very uncomfortable every night. I saw her marks and shadow everywhere in the house. I couldn&#39;t do anything about it.&quot; Sleep. In a rental house, a strange place is better.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since they were together, Lin Mei would make dumplings for Zhang Xiang in person every year on his birthday. Not long ago, on Zhang Xiang&#39;s birthday, Lin Mei said to him, &quot;I can&#39;t make dumplings for you today.&quot; &quot;Later, my mother made dumplings and I went home to get them. She didn&#39;t eat many, only five or six.&quot; Zhang Xiang recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the business trip, Zhang Xiang went to the supermarket to buy a crucian carp and made Lin Mei&#39;s favorite crucian carp soup. He remembered that Lin Mei was very happy to finish eating that day. She took out his leather shoes and polished them. The white edges of the black leather shoes were polished as white as snow. &quot;It&#39;s like new ones.&quot; Zhang Xiang sighed, &quot;When I came back, I saw this pair The edges of the shoes are still white, but the person is no longer the same.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Yu mentioned that in the hospital, the golden recovery period is 3-6 months. If you are paralyzed for a long time, the unavoidable complication is the reduction of cardiopulmonary function. If there is no financial pressure, you can do some rehabilitation training and use movable limbs to compensate for the out-of-control limbs. Some training in life and work can improve other functions of the body. maintained at a certain level. The follow-up care and family recovery stages place higher demands on caregivers, and require a lot of hard work from family members and caregivers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I once promised to take her to some places. I originally planned to go this year. No matter how she recovers in the future, I will take her there even if she is in a wheelchair. Of course, it will be very inconvenient to sit in a wheelchair, so I just want to cure her as much as possible and fulfill my promise to her.&quot; Zhang Xiang said that he would continue to &quot;demand justice.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a young writer, Zhang Xiang had a new book published in August. After Lin Mei’s accident, the publishing house sent him a sample book by express delivery, but he found that he could only go to the Cainiao Station to pick it up. “I feel like I don’t want to do this all my life. I have to go to that place again, but I have no choice but to get my book, because I have no choice.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(At the request of the interviewee, Lin Mei and Chen Jun are pseudonyms in the article.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[直男最爱的迪卡侬，靠卖一条裙子赚了几十亿？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259901]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-11 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Recently, a style of sports culottes has become popular on social media What is surprising is that this &quot;fairy skirt&quot; is neither Lululemon, a must-have for the middle class, nor well-known brands such as Nike and Under Armor, but Decathlon, an old friend of straight men. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Decathlon, which has always been known as an affordable paradise and a favorite among straight men, why did it rely on women to get out of the industry this time? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Data shows that since 2022, the number of notes about Decathlon on Xiaohongshu has reached 100,000+. With the surge in traffic, it has also driven the sales of its women&#39;s products.

In Decathlon’s official store, Women&#39;s products account for about half. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This is closely related to the development of China&#39;s outdoor economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;China&#39;s outdoor products market will reach 315 billion yuan in 2020, and is expected to reach 599 billion yuan in 2025.

These images are the result of scientists&#39; preliminary processing of the first batch of data obtained by the Euclid Telescope, but they have already demonstrated the powerful observation capabilities of the telescope - no telescope has ever obtained such clear images across such a large area of ​​the sky before. image. They believe that this telescope is ready to create the largest three-dimensional map of the universe in history, helping us gain insights into the nature of dark matter and dark energy in the &quot;dark&quot; universe, thereby revealing the hidden secrets of the universe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Euclid is a famous ancient Greek mathematician and is known as the &quot;Father of Geometry&quot;. His &quot;Elements of Geometry&quot; has been passed down to the world and laid the foundation for the development of geometry for more than two thousand years. Foundation. Scientists now realize that the density of matter and energy is closely related to the geometry of the universe and determines its future. Therefore, the European Space Agency (ESA) decided to name the telescope that explores the structure and evolution of the universe after Euclid to commemorate the pioneer of geometry. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Five&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Key Questions&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to the current mainstream cosmological theory, only 5% of the visible ordinary matter in the universe is , the remaining 95% includes 25% dark matter and 70% dark energy. Therefore, understanding the nature of dark matter and dark energy has become one of the most important issues in science today. The Euclid telescope is expected to play an important role in research in this area over the next decade and beyond. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With a range of up to 10 billion light-years, Euclid will observe billions of galaxies in more than 1/3 of the sky, creating a picture of the large-scale structure of the universe. picture. Scientists hope to study five key issues in cosmology by exploring the composition and evolution of the &quot;dark&quot; universe: the structure and evolutionary history of the cosmic web (matter in the universe is arranged in a huge network), what dark matter is, and the nature of the universe. How expansion changes over time, what the nature of dark energy is, and whether we really fully understand gravity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2007, researchers proposed two research plans in response to the European Space Agency&#39;s space exploration plan from 2015 to 2025, namely the &quot;Dark Universe Explorer&quot; (Dark Universe Explorer). DUNE) and the Spectroscopic All Sky Cosmic Explorer (SPACE). Both proposals propose complementary techniques to detect dark energy. After a period of evaluation and demonstration, the two plans were merged, and this became the later Euclid Telescope. In October 2011, the European Space Agency&#39;s Science Mission Committee selected the Euclid Telescope; in June 2012, the telescope project was officially established. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After more than ten years of demonstration, design, construction and testing, the Euclid Telescope is finally ready for use. On July 1, 2023, the Euclid Telescope was successfully launched from the Cape Canaveral Space Launch Site in Florida, USA, on board the Falcon 9 rocket of the US Space Exploration Company (SpaceX). At the end of July, the telescope flew near the Sun-Earth&#39;s second Lagrange point, about 1.5 million kilometers away from the Earth, and successfully entered its working orbit. The European Space Agency&#39;s Gaia telescope and NASA&#39;s James Webb Space Telescope are also in orbit around this point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/JW8CkTtukg7yZWUPLmJPaITk0vHwhPz8wsvoPcng.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height= &quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/JW8CkTtukg7yZWUPLmJPaITk0vHwhPz8wsvoPcng.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257868&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Artistic illustration of the workings of the Euclidean telescope. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(European Space Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Euclid Telescope is about 4.7 meters high and 3.7 meters in diameter. It consists of a service module and a load module composition. Among them, the payload module that performs the detection function includes a 1.2-meter-diameter telescope and two scientific instruments: the visible light band camera (VIS) and the near-infrared band camera (NISP); the service module mainly includes power generation and distribution, attitude control, data Devices for handling, propulsion, thermal control, remote control and telemetry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The European Space Agency has high hopes for the Euclid telescope. &quot;Dark matter pulls galaxies together, causing them to spin faster than visible matter itself can explain; dark energy is driving the accelerating expansion of the universe. For the first time, the Euclid Telescope will allow cosmologists to study these competing forces simultaneously Dark mysteries,&quot; European Space Agency science director Carole Mundell said on the European Space Agency&#39;s official website. &quot;The Euclid Telescope will help us make leaps in understanding the entire universe, and these beautiful images show that , the mission is poised to help answer one of the biggest mysteries of modern physics.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Five&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Amazing Images&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; The first five images released by the Euclid Telescope are the Perseus Cluster of galaxies, the spiral galaxy IC 342, the irregular dwarf galaxy NGC 6822, the globular star cluster NGC 6397 and the Horsehead Nebula. Picture of (The Horsehead Nebula). The field of view of the telescope for observation is very large, reaching 0.5 square degrees, which exceeds the sky area occupied by the full moon. It took less than a day to shoot the five images released this time. From bright stars to faint galaxies, the Euclid Telescope relies on its powerful observation capabilities to create exceptionally clear visible and infrared images. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perseus is one of the largest known structures in the universe, located 240 million light-years from Earth. This image of the Perseus Galaxy Cluster shows the 1,000 galaxies that are part of the cluster, along with more than 100,000 more distant galaxies in the background. This is the first time astronomers have been able to capture so many of the Perseus Galaxy at such a high level of detail in such a large image. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/snRL44n411PcaY3LYohiSopcZhMN2ISGKrfrplsS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/snRL44n411PcaY3LYohiSopcZhMN2ISGKrfrplsS.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257866&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The Perseus Galaxy Cluster photographed by the Euclid Telescope. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(ESA/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many of these faint galaxies have not been observed by astronomers before because some of them are very They are so far away that it took 10 billion years for their light to reach us. Astronomers have shown that galaxy clusters like Perseus could only form if dark matter was present in the universe. They will observe many galaxy clusters like Perseus through the Euclid telescope and map the distribution and shape of the galaxies in them to learn more about how dark matter binds these galaxies together to form galaxy clusters and shapes us The universe as seen today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While in orbit, the Euclid Telescope will image billions of galaxies, revealing the invisible effects of dark matter and dark energy on them. Among the first galaxies observed by Euclid, one was nicknamed the &quot;Hidden Galaxy&quot;. This spiral galaxy similar in shape to the Milky Way was officially numbered IC 342 and was also known as Caldway. Er number 5. Thanks to the infrared capabilities of the Euclid Telescope, astronomers have discovered key information about the stars in this galaxy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/e2hilsHZlMsOyyGLA3ZHSQY5ByNJnxBP2444xn3e.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/e2hilsHZlMsOyyGLA3ZHSQY5ByNJnxBP2444xn3e.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257867&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The spiral galaxy IC 342 photographed by the Euclid Telescope. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(ESA/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early universe, most galaxies did not look like the typical spiral shape of the Milky Way. Not only are they irregular in appearance, they are also small and form the building blocks of larger galaxies like the Milky Way. We can still find some such galaxies in the relatively nearby universe.

Globular star clusters are collections of hundreds of thousands of stars held together by gravity. Currently, no other telescope other than Euclid can see an entire globular cluster in a single observation and identify so many stars in the cluster at the same time. These faint stars can tell us about the history of the Milky Way and the location of dark matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/YtwMWpHhBpdTUm6apwOxqcqRlVFynVaPiQPCQJCF.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/YtwMWpHhBpdTUm6apwOxqcqRlVFynVaPiQPCQJCF.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257865&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Globular star cluster NGC 6397 photographed by the Euclid Telescope. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(European Space Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the celestial objects for which the Euclid Telescope released images this time, the Horsehead Nebula is the closest One, also known as Barnard 33, is part of the constellation Orion and is about 1,500 light-years away from Earth.

Euclid project manager Giuseppe Racca said on the European Space Agency&#39;s official website: &quot;Our high standards for this telescope have paid off. There is so much detail in these images, thanks to Special optical design, perfect manufacturing and assembly of the telescope and instruments and extremely precise pointing and temperature control.&quot; said René Laureijs, Euclid project scientist Comment: &quot;We have never seen astronomical images like this before, with so much detail. They are more beautiful and clearer than we could have hoped for, showing us much that has never been seen before in the known regions of the nearby universe. Characteristics. Now we are ready to observe billions of galaxies and study their evolution throughout the history of the universe.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The debut of the Euclid Telescope has inspired the astronomical community, and many people insist that Have the same opinion as Rene Laures. The images demonstrate the extraordinary capabilities of the Euclid Telescope&#39;s various instruments, which allow astronomers to study the distribution of matter in the universe and its evolution on the largest scales. Based on a large number of high-quality observations covering large areas of the sky, they will show us dark and hidden parts of the universe. And beyond the realms of dark matter and dark energy, these images show how Euclid can help astronomers create a treasure trove of information about the physics of individual stars and galaxies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Euclidean Union director Yannick Mellier said: &quot;Over the next few months, Euclid Union scientists will analyze these images and develop A series of scientific papers are published in the journal &lt;em>;Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics&lt;/em>;, as well as papers on the scientific objectives and instrument performance of the Euclid mission.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;In the months since the Euclid Telescope was launched, scientists and engineers have been testing and calibrating the telescope&#39;s science equipment. The team is currently making final fine-tuning in order to begin regular observations in early 2024. As the mission progresses, data obtained by the telescope will be released annually and open to researchers around the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the plan, the Euclid telescope will carry out observations for six years, after which the possibility of extending the mission will be evaluated based on the remaining amount of cryogenic gas used for propulsion. In the next six years, we can expect that the Euclid Telescope will continue to bring us new surprises and use more wonderful pictures to show us the hidden charm of the universe. The analysis of observational data will last longer, and astronomers will carefully search for clues to unravel the mysteries of dark matter and dark energy in these data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
