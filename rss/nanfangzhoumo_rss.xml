This bilateral exercise is the first joint exercise since the &quot;Reciprocal Access Agreement&quot; between the two countries officially came into effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A week ago, the fifth &quot;2+2&quot; meeting between Japan and the UK&#39;s foreign ministers and defense ministers was held face-to-face after a lapse of five years. In a joint statement issued after the talks, the two sides made it clear that they would increase the frequency of joint exercises. In addition, Japan will also provide cooperation with the United Kingdom in dispatching an aircraft carrier strike group to the Indo-Pacific in 2025. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Providing cooperation for the deployment of British aircraft carriers to the Indo-Pacific is just the latest step in deepening defense cooperation between Japan and countries outside the Asia-Pacific region. At present, Japan is promoting the joint development of next-generation fighter aircraft with the United Kingdom and Italy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan not only extended military cooperation invitations to European countries, but also played diplomatic cards in Southeast Asia. Previously, from November 3 to 5, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida visited the Philippines and Malaysia for the first time. Since the beginning of this year, the Kishida government has frequently visited Southeast Asia, covering almost 10 ASEAN member states. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Japan&#39;s efforts to win over countries in and outside the Asia-Pacific region such as the United Kingdom, France, Australia, and the Philippines are nothing more than wanting to revisit its old dream of the Russo-Japanese War and seek more interests for itself. While the United States continues to promote its Indo-Pacific strategy &#39;, and in the context of great power competition, relevant countries have also followed suit, trying to get a share of the regional game.&quot; Teng Jianqun, director of the Diplomatic Research Center of Hunan Normal University, told Southern Weekend reporters that in the context of multipolarization of international politics and global economicization, At the moment, Japan is trying to win over a large number of countries to stir up trouble in the Asia-Pacific. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 9, the spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in the UK responded to the erroneous remarks about China in the UK-Japan “2+2” joint statement, saying, “China has indisputable territorial sovereignty and maritime rights in the East China Sea and South China Sea. rights and interests. China will unswervingly safeguard its sovereignty and rights and interests, and firmly oppose relevant countries to sow relations between regional countries and create confrontation and confrontation. If the UK and Japan really want to become responsible countries, they should stop fanning the flames and stirring up trouble everywhere. Do things that contribute to regional peace and stability.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/E8VmoXNPlqgtjxiaGlfabmI7LvYMgX0hrypTsScd.jpg&quot; border =&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1700&quot; height=&quot;1133&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/E8VmoXNPlqgtjxiaGlfabmI7LvYMgX0hrypTsScd.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258739&quot; >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On January 11, 2023, local time, London, England, British Prime Minister Sunak (right) and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in London Towers sign defense agreement. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Winning over&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On November 7, Fumio Kishida met with the US Secretary of State at his official residence. Lincoln talks, exchanged views on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and confirmed that the two sides will cooperate on related issues. The day before, Blinken had just concluded his &quot;whirlwind diplomacy&quot; in the Middle East and arrived in Japan to attend the Group of Seven (G7) foreign ministers&#39; meeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The G7 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting, held in Tokyo from November 7th to 8th, was the last offline meeting hosted by Japan during its tenure as the G7 Presidency. During the meeting, Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa held talks with the foreign ministers of Canada, Germany and other member states, and took the opportunity to hold 95-minute consultations with the British Foreign Minister and Defense Minister. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In talks with defense ministers from various countries, the concept of a &quot;free and open Indo-Pacific&quot; was frequently mentioned by Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Japan&#39;s reaffirmation of the &#39;Indo-Pacific Concept&#39; through the G7 Foreign Ministers&#39; Meeting is just a rehash of old tunes with nothing new. What really deserves attention is Japan&#39;s gradual advancement in implementation.&quot; China Institute of International Studies Tang Qifang, associate researcher at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, analyzed this to a Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2022, the Japanese government adopted three security documents: the revised &quot;National Security Strategy&quot;, &quot;National Defense Strategy&quot; and &quot;Defense Force Preparation Plan&quot;, which not only clearly stated that it must have counterattack capabilities, but also emphasized that While taking the Japan-U.S. alliance as the foundation, we will deepen cooperation with so-called &quot;friendly countries that share values&quot; and strive to realize the concept of a &quot;free and open Indo-Pacific.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Less than a month after the &quot;Three Security Documents&quot; were released, Japan and the United Kingdom signed a &quot;Reciprocal Access Agreement&quot;, allowing both sides to conduct larger-scale and more complex military exercises on each other&#39;s territory. At this point, the United Kingdom has become the only European country that can conduct bilateral military exercises on Japanese territory, and is also the second country to sign this agreement with Japan after Australia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;After the promulgation of the new security strategy, Japan&#39;s defense policy has shifted from defensive to offensive, and the weapons and equipment, combat posture, and troop deployment of the Japanese Self-Defense Force have also changed from defensive to offensive.&quot; Teng Jianqun pointed out, &quot;The signing of the Reciprocal Access Agreement means that the relationship between Japan and relevant countries is entering a paramilitary alliance. The Japanese Self-Defense Forces can use this to go out and send troops to the United Kingdom and Australia to achieve the so-called &#39;national normalcy&#39; in a roundabout way.&quot; At the same time, Japan also wants to take the opportunity to release its military production capacity and accelerate the entry of weapons and equipment into the international market.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to linking up with countries outside the Asia-Pacific region, the Philippines has also become a key target for Japan to try to win over. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 3, Fumio Kishida arrived in the Philippines and held talks with Philippine President Marcos. In Manila, Fumio Kishida delivered his first speech to the Philippine Congress. In his speech, Kishida Fumio praised that bilateral relations between Japan and the Philippines have entered a &quot;golden age.&quot; At the same time, Japan and the Philippines also reached a consensus on launching negotiations on the Reciprocal Access Agreement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The targets chosen by Japan are all core members of the US military alliance. Australia is known as the US&#39;s &#39;Southern Anchor&#39; in the Asia-Pacific region, and the UK is its core ally in Europe.&quot; Tang Qifang pointed out, &quot;Although the Philippines is weak, the new President Marcos has tilted his foreign policy toward the United States after taking office. The United States is trying to turn it into a sharp thorn wedged in the South China Sea.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Linkage&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Japan is not only &quot;casting a wide net&quot; on the road to expanding its &quot;paramilitary alliance&quot;, but also continues to promote joint military exercises with relevant countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japanese media reported that the goal of the &quot;2+2&quot; talks between Britain and Japan is to enhance military coordination and interoperability by holding &quot;more frequent and more complex military exercises.&quot; After the signing of the Reciprocal Access Agreement, the first joint military exercise between Japan and Britain is on the way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, during the meeting of the G7 foreign ministers, the United States dispatched two aircraft carriers, the USS Ronald Reagan and USS Vinson, and the Japanese helicopter carrier USS Hyuga to conduct joint military exercises in the Philippine Sea. Rear Adm. Carlos Sadillo, commander of the U.S. Navy&#39;s First Aircraft Carrier Strike Group, pointed out that the exercise was designed to &quot;demonstrate how the United States and Japan can quickly respond to crises and interoperate and coordinate.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Australia, the Japan Air Self-Defense Force is seeking to normalize military deployment. Japan plans to station F-35, F-15 and F-2 fighter jets at air bases in Australia as early as fiscal 2024, with each deployment lasting several months. Japanese media pointed out that there is no clear legal basis for dispatching permanent troops to Australia or providing security assistance when necessary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Reciprocal Access Agreement facilitates joint military operations between Japan and Britain and Australia, and the same equipment purchased from the United States provides a sufficient platform for mutual integration and interoperability.&quot; Military Expert Wang Qunhuai told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2020, the United States approved the sale of 105 F-35 fighter jets to Japan. Adding the 42 previously purchased, Japan will have a total of 147 F-35 fighter jets. Australia and the United Kingdom are also &quot;die-hard fans&quot; of F-35 fighters and have ordered a total of 210 F-35 fighters from the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, in 2023, the United States successively agreed to sell hundreds of &quot;Tomahawk&quot; cruise missiles to Australia and Japan to enhance its naval long-range strike capabilities. It is worth mentioning that the United States has always been very cautious about the export of &quot;Tomahawk&quot; missiles. Prior to this, Britain was the only country besides the United States to possess this type of missile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In fact, the sale of weapons and equipment is an important tool for the United States to strengthen alliance relationships. The more American equipment is used, the deeper the relevant countries will be tied to the United States, and the more military sovereignty concessions will inevitably be made.&quot; Analysis by Wang Qunhuai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan’s military assistance to the Philippines came more directly. &quot;The Kishida government not only wants to provide money and equipment, but also tries to send troops to the Philippines.&quot; Tang Qifang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During his visit to Manila, Fumio Kishida sent a &quot;maritime gift package&quot; to the Philippines. According to a senior Japanese government official on November 3, Japan will provide five sets of fixed coast surveillance radars to the Philippines. This is the first time Japan has provided defense equipment to a foreign country under this mechanism since it established the &quot;Government Security Capability Strengthening Support&quot; (OSA) framework in April. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In the past, Japan focused on relying on &#39;government development assistance&#39; (ODA) and using economic diplomacy to expand its international influence, but now it has turned to improving the security capabilities of recipient countries.&quot; Tang Qifang pointed out, &quot;Japan It is hollowing out the peaceful constitution step by step, trying to transform from an economic power to a military and political power.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Team formation&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The interviewed experts and scholars told Southern Weekend reporters that Japan and the United Kingdom , the Philippines and other countries inside and outside the Asia-Pacific region &quot;form a circle&quot; and actively carry out defense cooperation, each getting what they need and utilizing each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2016, then Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and proposed the &quot;Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy&quot; for the first time in the joint communiqué. &quot;Since then, Japan has continued to promote this proposition in diplomatic settings, intending to cooperate with the United States in enhancing its intervention capabilities in the East China Sea, South China Sea and even the Asia-Pacific region, and to demonstrate its presence and enhance its international status and influence.&quot; Tang Qifang pointed out . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Tang Qifang’s view, Japan’s continuous breach of red lines in defense policy is inseparable from the acquiescence and connivance of the United States. &quot;The United States expects Japan to act as a &#39;pawn&#39; in the Asia-Pacific and help it reduce its burden and pressure. Japan also hopes to vigorously develop its military power and pursue becoming a military and political power. Although the interests of the two sides are different, the strategic goals are basically the same.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;The United Kingdom, Australia and other countries also have their own plans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;After Brexit, the UK has become an &#39;outcast&#39; in Europe. Based on geopolitical considerations, the UK hopes to use Japan as a &#39;bridgehead&#39; to strengthen its military deployment in the Asia-Pacific and highlight its status and From the perspective of business interests, the UK attaches great importance to the economic vitality of the Asia-Pacific region.&quot; Teng Jianqun analyzed that this is also the main reason why European and Asia-Pacific countries are willing to cooperate with Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as March 2021, the British government released &quot;Global Britain in the Era of Competition: A Comprehensive Assessment of Security, Defense, Development and Foreign Policy&quot;, which pointed out for the first time that the UK&#39;s global strategy must move towards the &quot;Indo-Pacific&quot; &quot;region&quot; tilt, and in May of that year dispatched the most advanced &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; aircraft carrier strike group to the Indo-Pacific region for the first time to conduct so-called &quot;freedom of navigation&quot; operations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the British aircraft carrier&#39;s &quot;global journey&quot; did not go smoothly. Two destroyers accidentally separated from the formation. In September 2023, the British Navy&#39;s &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; aircraft carrier conducted joint patrols with allies along the coast of Norway and the North Atlantic. Due to the significant reduction in the number of British Air Force fighter jets, the British aircraft carrier, which can normally carry about 30 F-35B fighter jets, only carries 8 fighter jets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The wish of &#39;Global Britain&#39; is very good, but Britain is no longer the &#39;Empire on which the sun never sets&#39; in the past. Whether its strength can match its ambitions is still a question. And the Philippines is not only weak in strength. On the other hand, the determination to follow the United States is not as strong as that of Japan, Britain and Australia.&quot; Tang Qifang pointed out, &quot;It remains to be seen how important the relevant countries can play in the so-called &#39;Indo-Pacific strategy&#39;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Facts As a die-hard ally of the United States, Japan is not willing to become a &quot;tool&quot; of the United States and still hopes to regain its autonomy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2022, the United Kingdom, Japan and Italy announced that they would jointly develop a common airframe for next-generation fighter aircraft. The three countries are determined to integrate their respective capabilities in cutting-edge air combat technologies such as stealth and high-tech sensors. By 2035 The latest fighter jet was launched years ago. It is worth noting that this is the first time since World War II that Japan has participated in a joint research and development program for advanced fighter aircraft that does not include the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, Japan has specially set aside funds in its defense budget for fiscal year 2024 and plans to develop an air-to-air missile for use by the next-generation fighter aircraft jointly developed by the three countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Japan does not want to put all its eggs in the American basket, nor does it want to hand over its military industry dividends to the United States. However, historically speaking, no matter what kind of cooperation Japan adopts, it will It is difficult to break through the restrictions imposed by the United States in military production. This time is no exception. The United States will try its best to block it and strangle its research and development plans, including Japan&#39;s new generation fighter aircraft, in the cradle.&quot; Teng Jianqun concluded, &quot;Japan&#39;s Strategic independence has always been difficult to escape from the constraints of the Japan-US alliance framework.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[9.9元价格战背后：前三季近万家咖啡企业倒闭，有独立咖啡馆营业额不够发工资]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260913]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Lin Li runs an independent coffee shop on Beijing Road in Guangzhou. This shop has been open for more than three years and is currently experiencing difficulties. During this period, the monthly turnover could not cover employee wages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Li told reporters from Nandu·Wancaishe that this year there has been a wave of store openings in the coffee industry. Some people who do not know how to open stores blindly open stores and occupy market space. Professional community coffee shops have attracted customers who know how to taste fine coffee. , and the spatial experience originally provided by independent coffee shops has become no longer rare, because chain coffee shops are also setting up large stores. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The chain coffee brands with larger store areas have taken away the in-store customers, and the community coffee shops along the street have taken away the in-store and take-out coffee cups. In short, now coffee shops The density is too high.&quot; Lin Li lamented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/d33e2d4d182d5e6ae80bb77a5591e6b9.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;450&quot; ​​data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/d33e2d4d182d5e6ae80bb77a5591e6b9.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258785&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since this year, Coffee chains are making every effort to open stores. Recently, Cudi Coffee, which was founded just one year ago, announced that it has more than 6,000 stores, setting a new record for domestic coffee stores; Luckin announced that it has more than 13,000 stores and predicts that it will open 15,000 stores by the end of this year; Starbucks is also speeding up Expanding stores, it &quot;opens a new store every 9 hours in China&quot;; Manner, a specialty coffee brand founded in Shanghai, is also running wild. Yesterday (October 30), its number of stores officially exceeded 1,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, amidst the craze for coffee, a large number of coffee shops failed to survive this year. Statistics from the third-party platform Kamen show that in the first nine months of 2023, the number of newly registered coffee-related companies was approximately 45,000, an increase of 74.10% over the same period last year, and 9,825 coffee companies were deregistered, with the number of cancellations increasing by 58.95% year-on-year. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, reporters from Nandu Bay Financial News visited a number of independent cafes, trying to understand whether they can survive the &quot;9.9 yuan cup of coffee&quot; storm and the increasing density of coffee shops. , what do they rely on to survive? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Cafes are everywhere, and the 9.9 yuan price war continues&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;Nearly 10,000 coffee companies closed down in the first nine months&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Lin Li works as a manager at an independent coffee shop on Beijing Road in Guangzhou Store manager, this store has three floors. The first floor of the store serves as the entrance. The second and third floors are bright and comfortable with simple decoration. There are large floor-to-ceiling windows on the side near the corner, allowing you to have a panoramic view of the outside scenery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The coffee products sold in the store include classic American coffee, milk coffee, special coffee and hand-brewed specialty coffee, with prices ranging from 20 to 100 yuan. There are also some baked simple meals for single consumption. The amount is about 50 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/4b6280e9848604abf3a19a02f5a9a56c.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;1067&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/4b6280e9848604abf3a19a02f5a9a56c.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258786&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Li told Nandu ·Wancaishe reporter, &quot;There used to be many customers on weekdays, and the daily turnover could reach tens of thousands of yuan.&quot; It is located in a tourist area, and it is &quot;extremely busy&quot; on weekends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, since the adjustment of epidemic prevention and control measures this year, the operation of the store has turned from profit to loss. In this regard, Lin Li said that he originally thought that there would be more customers this year, and he also vigorously promoted some creative and special products at the beginning of the year to attract traffic, but the effect was not good. &quot;Currently, the turnover is only two to three thousand yuan on weekdays and tens of thousands of yuan on weekends.&quot; However, after deducting the high cost of 65,000 yuan in shop rent, water, electricity and raw materials, there is still more than 10,000 yuan left, which is not even enough to pay employees&#39; wages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although it is located in a popular tourist destination, tourists do not help its business much. During the National Day this year, boss Lin Li visited nearby coffee shops. Although the streets were crowded, there were many empty seats in the coffee shops. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Li told reporters an observation: Foreign tourists are basically adults with children, and they do not have the habit of drinking coffee. On the contrary, Guangzhou locals did not travel abroad last year and came to coffee shops to kill time. There are more people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to changes in consumer customer groups, the increasing number of coffee shops on the streets has also impacted store business. Lin Li bluntly said that there has been a wave of store openings in the coffee industry this year. Some people who do not know how to open stores blindly opened stores, squeezing the market space. “The chain coffee brands with larger store areas have taken away the customers who come to the store, and the community coffee shops along the street have taken away the customers. The number of coffee cups sold in stores and for takeaways has increased. In short, the density of coffee shops is too high now.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The density of coffee shops in the Beijing Road business district is indeed increasing. Nanduwan Financial News reporter learned through Dianping that there are about 200 coffee shops within 2 kilometers of the Beijing Road business district. As of October 27, about 30 coffee shops have opened in the past three months, that is, every Within three days, a coffee shop opened in the Beijing Road business district. Among them, there are many well-known chain large space coffee shops such as Lavasa Coffee, store by.jpg, M Stand, and Starbucks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since this year, chain coffee brands have indeed been making great efforts to open stores. For example, Kudi’s stores have exceeded 6,000, and Luckin’s stores have exceeded 13,000. Statistics from Kamen show that in the first nine months of 2023, the number of newly registered coffee companies was approximately 45,000, an increase of 74.10% compared with the same period last year. At the same time, many coffee shops have fallen in the coffee wave. Kamen data shows that in the first nine months of 2023, 9,825 coffee companies have been canceled, and the number of cancellations has increased by 58.95% year-on-year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to intensive store openings, leading coffee chain brand Luckin Kudi Tims has also successively launched promotions of 9.9 yuan/cup or 8.8 yuan/cup, lowering the selling price of coffee in order to seize the market share. customer. Although there is a big difference between the customer base of low-price coffee and the customer base of independent coffee shops, the impression that a cup of coffee only costs 9.9 yuan is still engraved in the hearts of many consumers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/b5d8d224b36f1aa66eb98e4984ecbc14.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;1067&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/b5d8d224b36f1aa66eb98e4984ecbc14.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258781&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Li revealed, A customer once was surprised when he saw the price list after entering the store, &quot;Americano coffee actually costs more than 20 yuan.&quot; However, Lin Li believes that &quot;six or seven years ago, the Americano and latte we drank were more than 20 yuan a cup.&quot; Yes, this is the normal price.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bill, another independent cafe operator, also encountered customers who were confused about the price at his store. Bill thought, &quot;American and American cuisine cost more than 20 yuan. The nine-yuan American style uses different coffee beans, and the taste is different, so the price is naturally different.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, due to the competitive pressure brought by the store opening wave and price wars, Bill&#39;s store coffee Some price adjustments have been made. For example, the price of iced Americano coffee has been reduced to 20 yuan, and many stores have launched a beverage promotion of &quot;42% off in the morning and 32% off in the afternoon on weekdays&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Reduce the store area and shift towards high-end customers&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;Independent cafes are also planning to change&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Compared with the numerous stores that are still struggling with losses, Bill will The coffee shop moved from a shop along the street in Guangzhou to a community, and its store went from losing money to being able to continue operating. Although the operating area of ​​Bill&#39;s store has only been reduced by about 10 square meters, the rent burden has been cut in half, down to four digits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bill is a coffee fan with more than 20 years of coffee experience. Out of interest, he opened his first coffee shop in 2019. However, the rent of this shop is high due to the location where it is located. , but the flow of people is not much, and it has been affected many times by the epidemic before, so it is not profitable. Last year, Bill accidentally saw a store in the community for rent, so he closed the old store and started over. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The new coffee shop covers an area of ​​about 20 square meters, and most of the coffee drinks sold in the store are hand-brewed coffee. Bill manages it by himself because costs have dropped. According to his estimate, he can run the business with only 300 yuan a day. On the day when a reporter from Nandu Bay Financial News visited, he sold several hundred yuan of coffee beans and several hundred yuan of coffee drinks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ming Yue, who lives in Guangzhou, also wanted to open a coffee shop. Before opening the shop, she did some research. Mingyue found that although there were many coffee shops in Guangzhou, most of them had different decoration styles and menus. The drinks on the menu are all very similar. “As soon as I look at the menu, I can imagine what this cup of coffee will look like and taste like.” Moreover, what confuses Mingyue even more is that even though there are so many coffee shops, when she wants to When drinking a cup of hand-brewed coffee, she didn&#39;t know where to consume it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/90b868772cf40aeccd71515e58371d9d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;450&quot; ​​data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/90b868772cf40aeccd71515e58371d9d.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258782&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, last year , Mingyue opened an independent cafe in the Yanyun West Community of Huifu East Road, Guangzhou. In order to distinguish it from most coffee shops in the market, she positioned the shop as a high-end cafe targeting high-end customers. The cafe is located in a quiet community. It has a two-story store with an area of ​​about 200 square meters, a monthly rent of 25,000 yuan, and three employees. The price of coffee products in the store ranges from 38 to 168 yuan, and competition-level premium hand-brewed coffee is also available. However, the supply of such products is small, and the pricing depends on the type of beans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One year after opening the store, Mingyue confessed to a reporter from Nandu Bay Financial News that the coffee shop business is not easy. Not many people know about the newly opened store. It is a process of slowly accumulating word-of-mouth and popularity. , until last month, the store was still losing money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the situation has been slowly improving. The differentiation of positioning and the ability to brew coffee have helped her a lot. Mingyue said, &quot;We suffered the most when we first opened, because at that time Severely affected by the epidemic... Only half of this month (October) has passed and we have recovered our capital. This month is a steady profit.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Independent cafes survive on high-quality beans&lt;/h4 >; &lt;h4>;But it may be difficult for novices to identify the route&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After visiting these independent cafes, reporters from Nandu Bay Financial News learned that the reason why there are so many coffee shops in operation is difficult, in addition to the location where they are located. In addition to the problem and the influence of coffee competition, one of the problems is that the target group positioning is not clear enough. His customer group includes white-collar workers, freelancers, and office workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why stores like Mingyue and Ah Bill can survive is that in addition to working hard to accumulate regular customers in terms of cost and positioning, it is also very important that they have good quality and cost-effectiveness in the supply chain. A channel for coffee beans that are high quality and in line with market tastes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/d27afb385794723e0854e23204cf3d24.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;712&quot; height= &quot;534&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/d27afb385794723e0854e23204cf3d24.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258784&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Coffee beans sold at Mingyue store. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ming Yue attaches great importance to the selection of coffee beans. The positioning of her coffee shop is to make competition-level specialty coffee, and she can often get some micro-batch specialty beans. Mingyue told a reporter from Nandu Bay Financial News that she drank more than a thousand beans from April this year to now before finally deciding to purchase a dozen beans. &quot;Finding beans can represent many things, and the struggle to make specialty coffee is actually to compete with your ability to select products.&quot; Her feeling is that being able to find good coffee beans will benefit the store&#39;s customer base - those who know the goods and are willing to spend money. For customers who have money to drink expensive beans, it is very competitive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to high-quality coffee beans, another key point in product selection is to allow customers to drink coffee with high cost performance. Mingyue is trying to improve the price-performance ratio of the coffee in the store as much as possible. For example, the Americano coffee sold in its store is priced at 68 yuan. It uses green label Geisha beans. &quot;Customers who know the product will think that I sell it very cheaply when they see it in the store.&quot; The price of this bean in the market is 88 yuan. Yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/9bb65a681121dcf9ca50165b21d30b73.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;1200&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/9bb65a681121dcf9ca50165b21d30b73.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258783&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to passing high quality In addition to providing coffee drinks, selling coffee beans is also the main way for some independent cafes to make money. Some cafes will buy green coffee beans and roast them themselves, making them into cooked coffee beans before selling them, but the coffee beans are usually sold to regular customers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nandu·Wancaishe reporter learned from many coffee practitioners that, excluding all processing costs, the selling price of cooked beans is about three times that of green beans, and a green coffee bean sells for 100 -120 yuan/kg, so converted, the selling price of this cooked coffee beans is about 300 yuan/kg, and the specific situation will be different in each coffee shop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Bill, he would rather sell coffee beans than sell coffee. Bill roughly estimated that 50% of his store&#39;s turnover comes from selling coffee beans, and 50% comes from consumption in the store. &quot;The people who buy beans are mainly regular customers.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bill’s coffee menu has a full three-page hand-brewed coffee bean list. In addition, he also took out more than a dozen beans from the cabinet that were not on the bean list and introduced them to reporters in detail. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/7567eda950cc92f0e34c20047344c3c3.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;1067&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/7567eda950cc92f0e34c20047344c3c3.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258788&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While making Regarding coffee, Bill doesn’t have many coffee equipment in his shop. An Italian machine is his main tool for making American coffee and milk coffee. Bill said frankly, “When I opened the store, I planned not to sell coffee drinks, but I decided to do it after thinking about it.” This decision was the right one. Half of Bill’s current sales volume in the store still comes from these coffee drinks. “These are what we use.” To stabilize the basic market.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bill sells hand-brewed coffee, with prices ranging from more than 30 yuan a cup to 100 yuan a cup. He said that the price of beans is directly linked to the quality of coffee. Expensive beans will have obviously rich and lovely flavors, such as bergamot, lemon, and tropical fruits. Cheap beans have a relatively bland flavor and are priced low. Just expect that the flavor of this cup of coffee will not be that rich. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ming Yue’s store also sells coffee beans. 70% of her turnover comes from in-store consumption and 30% from selling beans. However, Mingyue said that since the store has only been open for a short period of time, it has not accumulated many regular customers, and there will be greater room for growth in this part of the business in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/d892ab5957be5431c882bca384a1a444.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;1067&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/d892ab5957be5431c882bca384a1a444.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258787&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The prize Mingyue won in the coffee competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the ability to obtain high-quality coffee beans has helped Bill and Mingyue a lot, because the quality of coffee beans varies and there are many supply channels, it is not easy for novices to understand the process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Li calculated an account for the reporter and opened a cafe. In addition to investing about 300,000 yuan in decoration and equipment in the early stage of opening the store, the price range of coffee beans on the market is very wide - raw materials. Beans range from 30 yuan/kg to tens of thousands of yuan/kg, and cooked coffee beans range from 80 yuan/pound to tens of thousands of yuan/pound. “It is difficult for a layman to tell the true price of a bean. As for what price it should be sold in a store, I don’t know the beans... and there are many companies that specialize in coffee shop opening planning. If people who don’t know the business buy beans directly from them, they will basically make money.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Conclusion: &lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;Consumers have more choices&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;The era of coffee segmentation may have begun&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As coffee competition becomes increasingly fierce, the practitioners of these independent cafes They are also thinking about where to go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After discussing with his boss, Lin Li plans to terminate the store&#39;s operations in November this year and wants to reopen it in a smaller store. As for the store&#39;s future competitive direction, he said he is still thinking about it, &quot;Maybe it depends on how to make the products more refined, instead of just making Italian, milk coffee, special blends, and hand-brewed everything.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/f7624557efce35d6d08cf44daf90061e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;1067&quot; data-src=&quot; //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/f7624557efce35d6d08cf44daf90061e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258789&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Those who are in it know best how fast the coffee market is changing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ming Yue is glad that she initially targeted the high-end specialty coffee track. Mingyue revealed that a year ago, a senior told her that opening a chain of popular coffee shops was the most profitable trend, but just recently, the senior told her that his chain of coffee shops could no longer continue, and was replaced by Luckin and others. The big chain coffee brands are losing competition, and he needs to find a new outlet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mingyue has seen that the coffee market is gradually segmented, and some customers’ tastes are already “very advanced”, such as its previously launched Combo product (ie “one bean, more”). It&#39;s exactly what the customers suggested. Mingyue said frankly, &quot;We need to be very precise in a very narrow field, rather than doing everything. Customers have already learned how to choose. If we do it seriously, there is still a lot of room for development.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mingyue&#39;s The plan is to wait until this hand-brew store can make a stable profit before opening a new store specializing in special blends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;span>;(At the request of the interviewee, Lin Li and Bill are pseudonyms)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 19:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[果敢四大家族：这群地头蛇是怎么炼成的？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260889]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Rebel Alliance&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The so-called four major families are fighting in Kokang The rise of the region, from its beginning to its fame, has only happened in the past ten years. Among them, I have to mention the Bai family, which ranks first among the four major families. If it were not for the head of the Bai family, Bai Zhicheng, I am afraid that there would not be any existence of the four major families in the Kokang region. Now the political and business affairs in the Kokang Autonomous Region The relationship map comes entirely from Bai Suocheng&#39;s betrayal in 2009. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The eldest son of the Bai family, Bai Suocheng, is an authentic Kokang man. He was born on April 1, 1950 in Hongyan, Kokang, Myanmar. Since Peng Jiasheng established the &quot;Kokang People&#39;s Revolutionary Army&quot; in 1965 to fight guerrillas with the government forces, Bai Suocheng began to follow Peng Jiasheng. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Song, who had been a guard for Peng Jiasheng for many years, recalled: Bai Suocheng fought bravely in those days and was willing to use his brain, so he was promoted quickly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1967, Peng Jiasheng joined the Communist Party of Myanmar. During the People&#39;s Army of the Communist Party of Myanmar, Bai Soucheng was promoted step by step from soldier to battalion commander under Peng Jiasheng. In 1989, Peng Jiasheng led his troops to withdraw from the Communist Party of Myanmar and ceased war with the Myanmar government. The Myanmar government recognized the autonomous status of Kokang, and Peng Jiasheng served as the chairman of the Shan State First Special Administrative Region of Myanmar and the commander-in-chief of the Kokang National Democratic Alliance Army. At this time, Bai Suocheng was promoted by Peng Jiasheng to serve as deputy commander of the Kokang Allied Forces, becoming the veritable second-in-command of the Kokang Alliance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The famous Kokang &quot;88 Incident&quot; occurred in 2009. Bai Soucheng reached a private agreement with the Myanmar government forces, appointed himself chairman of the Kokang Autonomous Region, and united with the Myanmar government forces to merge with the Allied Forces loyal to Peng Jiasheng. . Peng Bu was defeated and fled away from home. With the support of the Myanmar government, Bai Suocheng became the leader of the Kokang region. This was the beginning of the era of the four major Kokang families. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The four major Kogang families established in 2009 are actually Bai, Wei, and Er Liu. Among them, Bai Suocheng of the Bai family, Wei Chaoren of the Wei family, and Liu Guoxi of the Liu family were all former members of Peng Jiasheng. People conspired with the Burmese government forces to expel Peng Jiasheng, just like the three families of Zhao, Wei, and Han who were divided into Jin. Liu Abao (Liu Zhengxiang) of the Second Liu has always been a pro-Myanmar government strong local force, so theoretically he is not a traitor to the Allied Forces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Bai Suocheng came to power, he changed Peng Jiasheng&#39;s policy towards the Myanmar government. During Peng Jiasheng&#39;s era, the Kokang area was completely independent of Myanmar, and government troops were not allowed to enter the Allied Defense Zone. Bai Socheng declared his obedience to the leadership of the Myanmar government and allowed Myanmar government troops to station in the Kokang Autonomous Region. The local armed forces were reorganized into pro-government forces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/40zhghxze9vbbleypc2k0bydsfbda0aeux.jpg&quot; 0 &quot;width = &quot;1080&quot; height = &quot;620&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/40zhghxze9vbwbleypc2k0bydsfbda0aeux.jpg&quot; data-key = &quot;258754&quot;>; &lt;/p. >; &lt;p style = &quot;coloror : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>; On February 4, 2022, nearly a thousand cadre soldiers in the jealous security department arrived in Baifu to visit the New Year. = &quot;COLOR: #AAA;&quot;>; (Jianga Volkswagen/Figure) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After the Peng family left the pretty dare, although the Myanmar government has obtained the control of the jealous area in name, the local main ethnic group For the Han people in Myanmar (the Burma), the government&#39;s decree still needs to be implemented by the local real power. Under this modern toast system, the four major families have begun to grow up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first big family Bai&#39;s family has made a courage to attach the leader, and power is naturally indispensable. Bai Zhicheng not only served as the chairman of the Kokang Autonomous Region in 2009, but the eldest son Bai Ying was able to serve as the party secretary of the Gong Gong Fa (the ruling party established by the military government), and the chairman of the Baijia Industry Yum Southern Group. The second son Bai Yingcang served as the deputy director of the Candal Dare Finance Bureau, and served as the captain of the Kokang Militarian Brigade and the general manager of Yum! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The so -called Yum! Group is actually an industrial organization with a united political and business, and has obtained the qualifications of operating gambling, entertainment, and real estate development in the Jiangang area. The jealous area is located in the inland mountains, with bad natural conditions and inconvenient transportation. Since the Drugs of Peng Jiasheng, the pillar industry established in the local area is gambling and surrounding entertainment industry (prostitution). . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In Myanmar, gambling and other industries are actually illegal industries, but northern Myanmar is not a direct jurisdiction of the central government of Myanmar, so these gray industries are booming. The main economic sources of the four major families of the cigarette also come from this type of gray industry and related surrounding economic activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Wei Chao Ren, who ranked second among the four major families, had officially worshiped the first brigade of the Northeast Military Region during the Burmese Communist Party. Peng Jiasheng ruled the chief of staff of the Kokang Dai Dai Dai, and belonged to the three leaders of the Allies. After the establishment of the Kokang Autonomous Region, Wei Chaoren served as the leader of the political and legal system of the autonomous region and participated in the &quot;88 Incident&quot; expelled Peng Jiasheng in 2009. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/bs6oersyvfxulez3a3awysgifc45bjdd.jpg&quot; width = &quot;1080&quot; height = &quot;720&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/bs6oersyvfxulez3a3awysgiFWSAGC45bjdd.jpg&quot; data-key = &quot;258753&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color : #999; text-align: center; &quot;>; 2022, Wei Chaoren (third from right) at home &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; P>; After becoming one of the four major families, Wei Chaoren also actively embarked on the line.

Wei Huairen&#39;s third brother Wei Huairen served as commander of the Kokang Border Camp. He had a private armed for 2,000 people and controlled the police forces in the jealous area. Wei Chaoren&#39;s daughter Wei Rong is the chairman of Henry Group and operates industries such as entertainment, real estate development, mineral development, gold jewelry and other industries in Southeast Asian hotels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; With Wei Chaoren&#39;s position in Myanmar&#39;s political scene, the development of Henry Group has already gone out of the jealous area. There are a large number of hotels, casinos, finance, and jewelry businesses in Burmese, Cambodia, Laun State and other places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Wei Rong is also good at using new media means to promote, not only inviting celebrities to endorse, packing himself as a charity president, but also a lot of Myanmar anchors, promoting the recruitment of people to travel to northern Myanmar ——Mestr. The most famous is the Internet celebrity Li Saigao. This person is the Internet celebrity anchor recruited by Henry Group in the Punjun area. The netizens were revealed to be a group of fraud groups. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Henry Group can say that it has created the model of gray -producing and switching media, and has also attracted many Chinese people&#39;s attention to northern Myanmar. It is worth noting that Wei Qingtao, the eldest son of Wei Chaoren, has been captured by the Chinese police and repented through video. Wei Rong, who has always been high -profile, may have absconded out of the jeal area and temporarily avoid the trend in Myanmar or other Southeast Asian countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Liu Guoxi of the Liu family is also the old minister of Peng Jiasheng, but this person has been a cultural cadre during the Myanmar Communist Party, serving as the Minister of Finance of the Northeast Bureau of the Ninth Burma. . During the period of Peng Jiasheng, Liu was also a government official, but he did not master military power.

This person did not participate in any battle. Mr. Song, who was the Guardian of Peng Jiasheng, also revealed to me: Liu did not have the blood debt of the Koko Allied forces in his hands. He was a civilian and could not surrender the old Burmese. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Liu Guoxi died in 2020. His third son and one daughter operated minerals, casinos, hotels and other businesses in the jealous area. Among them, the third son Liu Dehong was a member of the Council of the Jiangang area.

Especially after Liu Guoxi&#39;s death, his children did not hold real duties in the jealousy government. Home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The only non -Peng family&#39;s Shengtai is Liu Abao (Zhengxiang) Liu family.

One of the people&#39;s connections is also closely related to the Burmese military. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, since Liu Abao did not participate in the activity of the rebellion Peng Jiasheng, the allies were not highly hated. It is rumored that the Kokang Allied forces launched the &quot;1027 operation&quot;, and they did not fight against Liu Abao, and they also did not crack down on Liu Abao. Shortly after the war, Liu Abao expressed surrender and was willing to cooperate with China to clearly pay its electricity -related business. Other industries are still operating normally. It can be said that he is a typical color -changing dragon merchant. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong>; The Ming family later lived in &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; If the influence of the political and business regions in the jealous area before Ming Xuechang&#39;s life, the Ming family surpassed the Liu Guoxi family for a long time, for One of the newcomers of Dengke. However, this person&#39;s qualifications are relatively shallow, and they have always been considered to be ranked behind in the jealous political community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; During the Myanmar Communist Party, Ming Xuechang was only a correspondent of Zhao Ming, commander of the Northeast Military Region. Although the leadership trust, his position is very low. During the period of Peng Jiasheng, the highest position of Ming Xuechang was just the deputy head of the Kokang County. It can be said that it was far from the core power circle of the Kokang, and it was not a cadre who could report to Peng Jiasheng directly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Until the &quot;88 Incident&quot; in 2009, Ming Xuechang followed Bai Cheng&#39;s backward Ge Peng family, and was relying on the Myanmar government. After the incident, it was promoted to the vice chairman of the Kokang Autonomous Region and a member of the Benba State Parliament. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is rumored that Ming Xuechang has a good relationship with the Myanmar government forces. Guardian police officer 21 battalion commander&#39;s head of the battalion, and later could not be the principal due to injuries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Because of the low generation, Ming Xuechang was far less high -profile as the Wei family and the Bai family.

The Ming family also became the primary goal of Chinese police to fight telecommunications fraud, and after surrounding Old Street, the Kokang Alliance took the lead in launching an attack on the Ming family site and became the last straw that crushed the Ming family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; With Ming Xuechang&#39;s suicide and many people being arrested, it can be said that the influence of the family and business in the jealous area has basically been zero. &lt;/p>; &lt;h2>; &lt;strong>; &amp; nbsp; &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h2>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong>; Agent politics &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; From the perspective of the five families, except In addition to Liu Abao, who was born in business, the other four were rising rapidly after the &quot;88 Incident&quot; Peng Jiasheng department in 2009. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This has a lot to do with the special political environment of the Kokang area. Although the Myanmar government has obtained the nominal control in the jealous area in 2009, most local residents are not the Burmese people. They have always been quite quite a lot of people in the Myanmar government. Relief and national identity are not strong. This is the common status of non -Myanmar residential districts after Myanmar ’s independence. The Myanmar government also knows this. In order to rule such regions at a low cost, the Myanmar government generally appoints agents of the nation&#39;s bloodlines as representatives of the Myanmar regime. As a result, these agents have obtained political rights higher than normal levels to a certain extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; From the past to the present, there are various gray and black industries in the border ethnic area of ​​Myanmar, which are caused by local independent or semi -independent political status. This situation is not unique. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In history, in addition to telecommunications fraud, there are also a series of serious black production problems such as drug trade, illegal smuggling, protecting wildlife trading, prostitution, and illegal gambling. Kokang is one of the typical examples. Under the protection of the five major families, the huge profits generated by the commercial kingdom can be protected within the Myanmar government through corruption. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/WSDHIJ4OPBYUP6QRLBTUU3VJ0ZMNV82ya.jpg&quot; 0 &quot;widt =&quot; 0 &quot;widt h = &quot;960&quot; height = &quot;719&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/wsdhij4opByup6qrlbtu3vj0zmnv82qku2ya.jpg&quot; data-key = &quot;258757&quot;>; &lt;/&lt;/&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>; Since September 2023, public security organs such as Yunnan Xishuangna and Pu&#39;er and other places have successfully eliminated a large number of overseas fraud denominations through launching border police law enforcement cooperation with related local law enforcement departments in Myanmar. One A large number of telecommunications network fraud criminal suspects were transferred to us &lt;span style = &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (provided by the Ministry of Public Security/Picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The influence of itself. Telecom fraud is not unique to the jealous areas. There are also a large number of telecommunications fraud parks such as Panbon and Miaowa La. However, under the trend of international cooperation to combat telecommunications fraud, such activities have begun to converge sharply, and a large number of suspects who operate telecommunications fraud have also been transferred to the relevant national police for processing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The Lang State Autonomous Region in northern Myanmar quickly responded to the call of cracking on electrical fraud. After searched more than 40 parks, they handed over more than 4,000 electrical fraud personnel to the Chinese police. China provides computers and mobile phones used by tens of thousands of electricity fraud, including millions of intelligence and evidence of fraud groups, and even the official investigation of officials involved in electrical fraud in the Pangang area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In this series of anti -electrical fraud storms that cooperate in multi -country cooperation, the jealous region has contributed to law enforcement operations, and only provides hundreds of people to China symbolically. And even plan to expand against the trend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/Yuoxpe6BM0Daasqkub5vi9uzTakyijobuf.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; widt h = &quot;960&quot; height = &quot;640&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/Yuoxpe6h3bm0dojdaasqkub5vi9uztakyijobuf.jpg&quot; data- key = &quot;258758&quot;>; &lt;/>; &lt;/ p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>; In order to resolutely curb the high incidence of criminal crimes involving telecommunications network fraud in northern Myanmar, the Ministry of Public Security deployed the Yunnan public security organs to strengthen border police cooperation and continue to carry out multiple rounds of crackdown.

After the surrounding areas and other surrounding areas cooperated with China to combat electrical scams, Henry Group and Wohu Villa are still lucky. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Although the strong dragon does not overwhelm the ground snake, if the ground snake actively bits the border, and it is not converged after being warned, it is another thing. After this rectification, the territory of political and business relations in the Jokang area has to be reshuffled again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 18:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一方提分手，另一方都应同意：或体面结束，或不受要挟]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260903]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-19 17:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; It is not uncommon for falling in love by the other party. The question is, should you agree? My opinion is that one party lifts up, whether it is a real breakup or a breakup to score the other party to accept their own conditions, the other party should agree. 36 氪 &quot;2022 Chinese Couple Breaking Report&quot; shows that more than 60%of girls first propose to break up. We use the woman to analyze with their hands, but the truth is the same in turn, and it is also applicable to the man of the man to break up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Some young netizens found a interesting phenomenon around them: girls broke up, and boys basically agreed. TA further said that because some girls like to break up as a means, boys generally take breakups as results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Let&#39;s discuss the situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the first situation, girls proposed to break up are serious, and in the general cognition of boys, proposing a breakup is equivalent to notifying the breakup. You all notified, what can you do if you do n’t accept it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; And, I really want to break up, the other party is very decent, and it is not good? If one party wants to break up, the other party may cause tragedy if it is not forgiven, which is what many people who are in love. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I agree with the point of &quot;serious breakup&quot;. Breaking up is equivalent to the death of love. Naturally, a person who loves life should also love feelings and cannot hang &quot;breakup&quot; on his mouth, unless you can&#39;t continue, you must say. In other words, don&#39;t say &quot;breakup&quot;, there will be no room to say -when the &quot;breakup&quot; exit, that is, &quot;one sword sealed throat&quot; to the old days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the second situation, girls propose to break up are hypothetical, the purpose is to make her boyfriend a fan. On the Himalayan, some netizens talked: Girlfriend often broke up, the purpose is to give me gifts to her. What kind of psychology is this? A group of netizens followed the accent: This kind of girlfriend just wants to want you. If it is not too deep, it is better to leave decisively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In reality, there is indeed such a situation: the girl who lifts the hand is to use the breakup as a means of game, forcing boys to make compromises to meet their requirements. In this case, boys begging for no distinction is the &quot;cooperation&quot; of game techniques, and it is also a unnecessary sacrifice to self -rights and stances. This may lead to various passive situations. Standing from the standpoint of human nature, if the girl broke up unreasonablely, it has received a good results -for example, her boyfriend has never heard of hearing and dare not violate himself. Then this girl is difficult to gain a sense of accomplishment, and deliberately makes them an inertia, making the other party continue to flourish according to the owner&#39;s intention like a bird locked in the cage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; As long as a person is not abused, it is unlikely to experience the other party&#39;s teasing and degradation and tolerate the extreme and not collapse. It is completely accepted by non -scoring requirements. Falling in love is like this easily and compromising. After marriage, if the other party is divorced without saying a word, what should you do? Some people say good: &quot;Break up now, and you will definitely divorce in the future.&quot; Is this true, is it still to continue to compromise? If this is the case, what is the happiness and trust in marriage? I am afraid that it has long been exhausted by the willfulness of one party, the bully, and the weakness of one party. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It can be seen that whether it is true or fake, it is the best choice. A person is in front of a person who does not love himself, in front of a person who always trys to &quot;test&quot; himself, except for a bit of hard gas, there is no trick. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Of course, people&#39;s hearts are long meat, and they have been together for a long time, and it is really difficult to make it. Human nature is always complicated. When he still loves each other deeply, he is &quot;kicked&quot; by the other party. It is really amazing and painful. Therefore, some people who have been broken up have reserved for their past love. Strange, but the facts show that people who have long pain are not as short of pain. It is wise to leave the &quot;wrong payment&quot; relationship earlier. The choice is difficult, and the heart is painful, and it is better to get out of the mud that makes yourself fall into emotion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; You know, hesitant to hesitate to break up, not only makes yourself and the other party be tired, but you are more likely to be ridiculed and affected by crying and restlessness all day long. future. After all, death itself means losing self -esteem and &quot;low to dust.&quot; In addition, hesitant, weak and bullying can also bring bad situations, even evil results. In life, some couples &quot;have a long time, and they must be divided for a long time.&quot; After wasting their good youth, they ended up with a breakup, which is equivalent to doing a useless work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In my hometown, some rural couples have noisy for a lifetime, and often one party wants to leave one party. As a result, the two people do not reconcile, which also affects the children’s life. If you break up early, you can be able to break up. Is there such a thing? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Compared with these results, I resolutely agreed to break up. There are not only a lot of unnecessary troubles, but also &quot;let go&quot;. Isn&#39;t the best result obtained? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Besides, the decision of the breakup is also a lesson to the other party. A psychological expert told a story that one of her friends was in love, and her mood was very low. She thought she was dumped by others. When asked, she knew that it was her initiative to break up. The point is that she didn&#39;t want to break up, but she threatened her boyfriend again, but this time her boyfriend did not keep her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Break up to see character&quot;. It is not easy for the so -called do not want to do what they do not want to do. It is not easy for two people who love each other to come together. They should operate their feelings well and jointly resist the risks encountered in the journey of life. ? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is worth noting that some people like to say that they break up and break up with people, not only disrespect for each other, but also to complete a rules. Some people just enjoy the sense of accomplishment of &quot;taming each other under their feet&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Because there is no time limit for rules, this situation should be vigilant. Resisting rules is the responsibility of people in every &quot;emotional castle&quot;. Life is not long, we can prepare to spend this life with a person, and we can also prepare to see the machine. In order to avoid being troubled and restrained by the lack of quality, we should do so. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 17:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[领航鲸“搬家”分几步？为啥要抹凡士林？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260907]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On November 17, two pilot whales more than 4 meters long and weighing about 800 kilograms arrived from Hangzhou Departing from a polar ocean park, &quot;relocated&quot; to an ocean park in Zhoushan more than 200 kilometers away, and moved into a more spacious &quot;new home&quot;. With a head weighing 800 kilograms, it is quite a battle to &quot;move&quot; such a big man over a long distance. It not only requires cranes and large trucks, but also requires more than 20 adults to carry it. So the question is, how many steps does it take to &quot;move&quot; a pilot whale? What is the greatest difficulty? What preparations have the staff made to protect the pilot whales? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;What are the steps to “move” a pilot whale? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is not an easy task to &quot;move&quot; a pilot whale weighing about 800 kilograms, and to move both animals together. So, what are the steps to &quot;move&quot; a pilot whale? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The staff said that there are five steps to &quot;moving&quot; the pilot whale this time. The first step: Capture and transportation, after capturing the pilot whale from the breeding tank, transport it to the box; The second step: Putting into the box and hoisting; The third step: Inspection before transportation, including the pilot whale’s breathing frequency, Check the mental state, etc.; Step 4: Monitoring during transportation, including monitoring of water temperature, air temperature, mental state, activity state, respiratory rate, etc. of animals during transportation; Step 5: After arriving at the destination, hoist into the water . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;What are the living habits of pilot whales? Why did it get its name? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;To successfully &quot;move&quot; a big guy like a pilot whale, you need to understand its physiological characteristics and living habits. Next, let’s get to know the large marine creature-pilot whale. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pilot whales are mammals in the family Cetacea, Delphinidae, and are also called &quot;pilot whales&quot; because of their huge size. Pilot whales are divided into two types: long-limbed pilot whales and short-limbed pilot whales. Long-limbed pilot whales are mainly distributed in high-latitude waters, while short-limbed pilot whales are distributed in tropical and temperate waters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/22f69f961e179bf7552d09428fac69b7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;659&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/22f69f961e179bf7552d09428fac69b7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258780&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sun Dong, associate researcher at the Second Institute of Oceanography of the Ministry of Natural Resources:&lt;/strong>;Pilot whales generally like to gather in large groups in the natural marine environment. The size of this group can usually reach 200 to 300. , this is a very large scale, which is rare among whales. Pilot whales are the liveliest among cetaceans. Pilot whales are often seen by sailors willing to accompany sailboats or ships when the ship is sailing on the sea. Their playful behavior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, due to the destruction of the marine environment, the number of pilot whales has been declining, and they have been included in the second level of my country&#39;s &quot;List of National Key Protected Wild Animals&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;What are the difficulties for the &quot;big&quot; pilot whale to &quot;move&quot;? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In addition to their large size and heavy weight, what are the difficulties in &quot;moving&quot; pilot whales? Come on and listen to the expert’s introduction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sun Dong, associate researcher at the Second Institute of Oceanography of the Ministry of Natural Resources:&lt;/strong>;From the most professional perspective, the most important thing about the &quot;movement&quot; of whales is that we call this whale Cetaceans need to use their lungs to breathe, so the vent on its back, or in layman&#39;s terms, its nostrils must be exposed above the water to prevent it from drowning. Cetaceans can drown. But the water cannot be put in very little. If it is put in very little, one will cause its skin to become dry and dehydrated. Dehydration is a very serious event for cetaceans. The second is the huge body of cetaceans. , it needs the buoyancy of water to support its weight. Another factor is temperature. For cetaceans, especially when the temperature rises, it will cause them to suffer from overheating shock. This should be strictly avoided. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Why do pilot whales need to apply Vaseline when they “go out”? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When it comes to &quot;moving&quot; a &quot;big guy&quot; like a pilot whale, every detail is important. There is such a detail in the transfer process that the reporter just photographed. After the pilot whale came out of the water, the staff smeared Vaseline on the pilot whale. Why did they do this? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Quansheng, technical director of a polar marine park in Hangzhou:&lt;/strong>;The pilot whales apply Vaseline to prevent dehydration, because when the temperature is too high, cetaceans can easily dehydrate. After covering it with Vaseline, it will prevent moisture from dispersing. After applying Vaseline, we will cover it with a layer of wet towel. In this way, it has a water-retaining effect, that is, one is to prevent dehydration and the other is to moisturize. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Experts told reporters that this time the two pilot whales &quot;moved&quot;, they were smeared with medical Vaseline which had almost no harm to their skin. The main area of ​​application was the back skin exposed to the air, but Avoid air vents when applying. Two pilot whales arrived at their &quot;new home&quot; in Zhoushan. Before entering the water, the staff used a towel to wipe off the Vaseline on the pilot whales. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;How to reduce the stress response of pilot whales during transportation? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From Hangzhou to Zhoushan, it spans more than 200 kilometers. To ensure the safety of the animals, the vehicle must maintain a stable speed of 90 kilometers per hour during transportation. This extended the original drive of more than 2 hours to 5 hours. How can pilot whales reduce their stress response during long-distance transfers and reach their &quot;new home&quot; safely? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Quansheng, technical director of a polar marine park in Hangzhou:&lt;/strong>;We will stop eating 24 hours before transportation, and gradually reduce the amount of food in the first three days. This is the first ; Second, we will ensure appropriate water and air temperatures during transportation. This time we set the water temperature for the pilot whale at 23.5°C, which is a water temperature that is more suitable for raising it; third, we We need to ensure that the air in this transport vehicle circulates, that it cannot be too hot or too windy, and that it must be enclosed. Fourthly, we will have accompanying veterinarians and keepers who have raised it for a long time, who will caress and carry it out. An exchange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to allow the pilot whales to adapt to the new environment as quickly as possible, the room temperature, water temperature, lighting and other aspects of Zhoushan&#39;s &quot;new home&quot; are set according to the natural environment in which they live. However, in the first two days after arrival, the staff will feed a small amount of food, and then resume a normal diet after the pilot whales slowly adapt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[商务部清理歧视外资措施，废除“特斯拉禁入”是个好的开始丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260899]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce recently stated at a regular press conference that the Ministry of Commerce has recently organized a special cleanup to further investigate Regulations and measures that may exist that discriminate against foreign-funded enterprises will create a fairer market competition environment for foreign-funded enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the website of the Ministry of Commerce, the Department of Foreign Investment of the Ministry of Commerce issued a document on November 8, requiring a special cleanup of regulations and measures containing unreasonable differential treatment of domestic and foreign capital. The scope of the cleanup includes laws, regulations, normative documents, and other policy measures issued by local governments and departments, as well as various measures related to business entities formulated by relevant departments. The document also lists a number of specific cleanup matters, including restrictions on foreign investment in access areas, discriminating or excluding foreign-invested enterprises and their products and services on the grounds of foreign brands, excluding or restricting foreign-invested enterprises from participating in government procurement, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Ministry of Commerce’s special clean-up operation is targeted. In recent years, with the improvement of China&#39;s economic strength and external trade frictions such as &quot;decoupling and breaking links&quot;, there has been a domestic argument that &quot;it is strong enough and no longer needs foreign investment.&quot; There are also more and more comments on social media that are hostile to foreign brand products, and there are even restrictions on foreign brand products in some places. Some time ago, Hunan Yueyang Sanhe Airport banned Tesla electric vehicles from entering the airport on the grounds of &quot;confidential control.&quot; After attracting great attention, Yueyang Airport lifted this restriction, but similar phenomena still exist in many local departments. In addition to Tesla, Apple&#39;s mobile phones and other electronic products also receive special &quot;care&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of restriction on foreign brands has no legal basis. In September 2023, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning stated at a press conference that China has not issued laws, regulations or policy documents prohibiting the purchase and use of foreign brand mobile phones such as Apple. The reason why some departments and companies ban Tesla cars, Apple mobile phones, etc. is that their cameras, microphones and other sensors may obtain surrounding environment information and upload it abroad, which involves &quot;state secrets&quot; and &quot;personal information security&quot;. However, according to Tesla&#39;s statement, the video captured by its car&#39;s &quot;Sentinel Mode&quot; is only stored in the vehicle&#39;s local storage device and will not be uploaded to the Internet. Other vehicle data will only be uploaded to the company&#39;s data center in China. The iCloud service used by Apple&#39;s domestic users is also operated by the domestic big data company &quot;Cloud Guizhou&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Tesla and Apple are foreign brands, their products sold domestically are basically produced in factories in China. Their super factory in Shanghai has more than 10,000 employees. In addition, the localization rate of Tesla&#39;s auto parts has exceeded 95%, which has stimulated the development of many domestic companies in the upstream industrial chain, not only bringing income to the employees of these companies, but also improving the production level of the companies. The improvement of the production capacity of these enterprises has also provided energy for the development of other domestic automobile manufacturers. The same is true for Apple. Not only does its domestic foundries directly provide jobs for hundreds of thousands of people, but it also greatly improves the capabilities of the domestic industrial chain through strict management of domestic suppliers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Introducing foreign capital is not just about hundreds of millions or even billions of money, but more importantly, entrepreneurial spirit and talent, which is to discover or even &quot;create&quot; market opportunities and seize them. , the ability to create social wealth. During the process of reform and opening up, the introduction of foreign investment has played a huge role in promoting China&#39;s economic development. This impetus does not only come from money itself. China&#39;s goal of introducing foreign investment is not only to solve the problem of insufficient domestic development funds, but more importantly, to &quot;learn advanced Western technology and management experience.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, it may be the competition, management and other concepts that come with foreign investment that play a greater role in promoting China&#39;s development. It is precisely because of the pressure of foreign capital that China&#39;s market-oriented reform has been accelerated, and domestic enterprises have also strengthened their bodies and developed in the competition with foreign capital. Even though China has now become the world&#39;s second largest economy, it still needs to introduce foreign investment. Because in many areas, China still needs foreign technology and entrepreneurial talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2023, the State Council issued the &quot;24 Policies and Measures for Attracting Foreign Investment,&quot; emphasizing the need to create a &quot;market-oriented, legal, and international first-class business environment.&quot; A market-oriented and legalized business environment requires that foreign-invested enterprises be treated equally and receive national treatment. As long as they are not within the scope of the negative list stipulated by the state, there cannot be any discrimination or restrictions on foreign investment. The products and services provided by domestic foreign-funded enterprises should also be treated equally with those of other domestic enterprises. Just like although the &quot;Government Procurement Law&quot; stipulates that under normal circumstances government procurement &quot;should purchase domestic goods, projects and services,&quot; the Ministry of Finance issued a special document in 2021 requiring that except for procurement projects involving national security and state secrets, government procurement must not distinguish Treat products produced in China by domestic and foreign-funded enterprises. As long as it is produced within China, regardless of whether its suppliers are domestic or foreign, their equal participation in government procurement should be guaranteed. This special clean-up operation by the Ministry of Commerce also includes the issue of restricting foreign-invested enterprises from participating in local bidding and government procurement as a clean-up matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Ministry of Commerce’s cleanup operation began, social media information showed that some local agencies’ “No Tesla Entry” signs had been removed. Prohibiting discrimination against foreign-owned enterprises is a good start. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 15:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[人为什么变胖，问题可能没那么简单]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260883]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The global obesity and overweight problems have become increasingly apparent in recent decades. According to data from the World Health Organization, in 2016 Nearly 40% of adults worldwide are overweight, of which 13% are obese. There are approximately 2 billion overweight people. This increase continues despite public health measures to prevent and slow obesity in many countries. Along with the obesity epidemic comes a large disease burden. How to better manage weight has become an urgent problem in the field of health sciences. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Balancing the quality and quantity of carbohydrates&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Carbohydrates, as a major source of dietary energy for people, have long been the focus of weight loss. Coping strategies such as the &quot;ketogenic diet&quot; of eating less or no staple food, or even strictly limiting carbohydrate intake have been derived. The &quot;ketogenic diet&quot; cuts off carbohydrates as an energy source and attempts to promote weight loss by burning fat to provide energy. Although this method has some short-term experimental support, what will happen if it is persisted in the long term is still a mystery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, the &quot;ketogenic diet&quot; requires maintaining a high level of fat intake while maximizing carbohydrate intake, which may increase the risk related to cardiovascular disease. In addition, it will also put pressure on the liver, kidneys and maintenance of nutritional balance, and there is a risk of a series of adverse reactions such as cognitive decline, constipation, fatigue, and nausea. Therefore, long-term adherence to such a diet for weight loss remains controversial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, compared with the controversial &quot;ketogenic diet&quot; that strictly limits carbohydrate intake, a diet that reasonably controls carbohydrates has actually been widely recognized, including paying more attention to nutritional balance and simplicity. Processed “Mediterranean Diet” etc. Recently, scientists from Harvard School of Public Health and other institutions also found through long-term observational studies that instead of focusing generally on the total amount of carbohydrate intake, it is better to pay more attention to the quality and source of carbohydrates, so as to achieve better long-term weight management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because their research data shows that some carbohydrate-containing foods do make you fatter as you eat them, but there are also some carbohydrate-rich foods that may actually have a weight loss effect if you eat too much of them. Overall, higher glycemic index and glycemic load will lead to weight gain. Adding 100 grams of starch or added sugar per day increased weight gain by 1.5 kilograms and 0.9 kilograms respectively over four years. Relevant research was published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) in September 2023. The main sources of daily starch are seeds and tubers such as wheat and rice, which are various staple foods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Starchy vegetables such as potatoes and peas, and refined grains are also associated with weight gain. A 100-gram daily intake increase will increase weight gain by 2.6 kilograms and 0.8 kilograms respectively. But if it is non-starchy vegetables and whole grains, the increase in intake will actually reduce weight gain and help control weight. Increasing the intake of non-starchy vegetables by 100 grams per day will reduce weight gain by 3 kilograms, and the intake of 100 grams of whole grains will reduce weight gain by 0.4 kilograms. Similarly, consuming carbohydrates through fruits can also help reduce weight gain, with a daily intake increase of 100 grams corresponding to 1.6 kilograms less weight gain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why these data are limited to four years to assess weight change is because some health data in the study are updated on a four-year cycle. Using data from more than 130,000 people in projects such as the Nurses&#39; Health Study, researchers analyzed the relationship between people&#39;s diet and weight changes over more than two decades and discovered these overall patterns of carbohydrates. Over the past two decades, people&#39;s average weight has increased by 8.8 kilograms, about 1.5 kilograms every four years. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Highly processed carbohydrates have become a target&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;If a person pays more attention to the management of carbohydrate quality and sources, use equal amounts of non-starchy vegetables, fruits and Substituting whole grains for foods like refined grains, starchy vegetables, and sugary drinks will result in less weight gain. In addition to foods such as vegetables and whole grains that are consumed in large amounts, an increase in dietary fiber intake also helps with weight management. Every 10 grams of increase per day corresponds to a reduction of 0.8 kilograms of weight gain. Considering that the age of the people in the study happens to span the middle-aged and elderly stages, including the critical period of weight gain in middle age, this large-sample long-term follow-up study has important reference significance for middle-aged people to strengthen weight management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, although the latest research data has the advantages of large volume and long follow-up time, and can capture more changes in diet and health, there are still some limitations, such as carbohydrate intake and Information such as weight is reported by the respondents themselves. There may be certain errors in these data, which will affect relevant conclusions and interpretations. In order to better understand the long -term health impact of carbohydrates, more long -term research of random control in the future will be further confirmed to further confirm the conclusions in the latest discovery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for why people become obese, the most popular explanation is energy imbalance, which is commonly known as &quot;eating more and moving less&quot;, but this is not the exact answer to the common obesity phenomenon in humans. As obesity rates remain high, some scientists think the problem may not be that simple. Two common explanations currently take into account more complex body system factors. For example, one view is that on the basis that energy intake exceeds consumption, because modern people eat too much ultra-processed food with high energy density, there may also be endocrine, metabolic and nervous system effects, making it more difficult for people to eat food. Self-control. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another explanation related to insulin is that the hormonal response triggered by a large amount of ultra-processed carbohydrates causes the body to store more energy in fat, resulting in a lack of energy required for basic metabolism of the body. , after the brain recognizes this state, it will issue a hunger command, thus entering a vicious cycle of getting fatter and overeating. While the understanding of obesity remains controversial, these analyzes and a host of health studies have focused on carbohydrates in processed foods, including all types of so-called &quot;junk food&quot; that are high in sugar and fat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ultra-processed carbohydrates are classified as &quot;junk food&quot;, which is not unrelated to the current scientific community&#39;s understanding of the functions of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are the only macronutrient for which there is no minimum intake requirement. In reality, in some places people eat a lot, but in other places people eat very little. What specific ranges of carbohydrate intake humans need to maintain in order to survive, be healthy, and even live longer are specific questions that need to be answered by scientific evidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The risks and costs of eating out&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From an evolutionary perspective, larger brain capacity is consistent with the evolutionary process of humans, and larger brain capacity is consistent with the evolutionary process of humans. The brain needs more energy support. After humans entered agricultural civilization, typical lifestyle changes included growing and eating grains, which are foods rich in carbohydrates. For this reason, the human digestive system has become more adapted to starch, but accordingly, new eating habits have also brought about a series of new health problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Latest research suggests that the mechanisms by which carbohydrates, glycemic index, and glycemic load may have negative health effects on weight may include enhanced responses to changes in insulin and other hormones that favor fat accumulation. . In recent years, some studies have shown that in addition to weight gain, the quality of carbohydrates may also increase a series of other health risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, a systematic analysis study published in The Lancet showed that compared with those who ate the least dietary fiber, people who ate the most dietary fiber had better health outcomes. The risks of a range of diseases are 15% to 30% lower, including lower cardiovascular disease mortality, coronary heart disease incidence, stroke incidence and mortality, and lower risks of type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer. In addition, clinical trial data also shows that eating more dietary fiber will lower blood pressure and total cholesterol. The lowest risk dietary fiber intake is 25 to 29 grams per day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similarly, studies have found that whole grain intake may also help reduce overall disease risk. Increasing the intake of dietary fiber in the daily diet, replacing refined grains with whole grains, and eating more coarse grains will not only help with weight management, but also improve people&#39;s health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that with the epidemic of obesity in recent years, scientists have tried to verify a variety of weight loss and weight management strategies, most of which are related to &quot;eating&quot;, including the total energy of meals and the amount of food consumed. time. In 2022, a one-year intermittent fasting trial carried out in China found that while restricting food energy, arranging eating times from 8 am to 4 pm every day and not eating at other times, such a The weight loss effect of this dietary pattern is no better than that of energy restriction alone, indicating the importance of controlling energy intake for weight loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in April 2023, Australian researchers further narrowed the eating time window to 8 am to 12 noon every day, limiting the intake of 30% of the required energy to only these four hours. And you stick to this eating method for three non-consecutive days in a week, and you can eat whatever you want at other times. The experimental results found that under certain circumstances, intermittent fasting that limits meal times still has its own unique effect, not only can Lowering the weight of trial participants could also improve people&#39;s glucose tolerance and reduce their risk of type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Leonie Heilbronn, a professor at the University of Adelaide School of Medicine and others who have long studied fasting and meal times, explained to Southern Weekend reporters that human metabolism is governed by biological rhythms The brain operates downwards, alternating between day and night 24 hours a day. Improper eating time will cause the brain&#39;s light and dark rhythms to be out of sync with the biological clocks in other organs and tissues. Moving meals earlier and avoiding eating at night will help the body coordinate these rhythms. combine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, a randomized controlled trial in the UK also supported the conclusion of eating early, but it was not because of differences in metabolism at different times, but because the study at that time found that if you eat more in the morning, your overall health will be reduced throughout the day. If the meal time is moved forward, people will not feel too hungry that day, and appetite and total energy intake will be controlled. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Weight management should be a long-term plan&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;For weight control, no matter what the strategy is or how difficult it is, whether it can be persisted in the long term is the key to weight management. key. Otherwise, no matter how radical and rapid the weight loss method is, it will rebound when you can&#39;t persist, and destroy people&#39;s confidence in weight management during the continuous rebound. Some people whose obesity problem is particularly serious and whose weight loss through conventional methods has been ineffective can only reduce their health risks through extremely limited methods such as bariatric surgery. However, this method requires the removal of part of the stomach, which is extremely invasive and does not work. Not suitable for most people who have less severe weight problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From this perspective, the latest research controls weight by managing the source of carbohydrates, which does not involve harsh food intake restrictions or long fasting times, and has positive implications for people&#39;s long-term weight management. significance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; And, researchers also found that the relationship between the source and weight management of carbohydrates and weight management is more obvious compared to those with normal weight and weight management. Sensitive, more fragile, but in turn suggests that those who pay more attention to the sources of carbohydrates in their diet may benefit more from this type of weight management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Reflected on the specific food is to limit the refined rice noodles of sugary drinks and various types of cooking, fried, baking, and eat more rough -processed grains, as well as fruits and non -starch categories Vegetables etc. The &quot;Mediterranean diet&quot; widely praised by scientists is actually more scientific in managing carbohydrate sources and maintaining nutritional balance. In addition to consuming more vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, it also eats more beans and nuts, and more Fish and moderate amounts of poultry and dairy, but not a lot of red meat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[拿电动汽车对比主战坦克：券商的“奇葩研报”为何层出不穷？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260891]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a screenshot of a research report comparing BYD’s U8 and T-90 main battle tanks was exposed. This screenshot of the research report comes from the special research report on BYD released by the Western Securities R&amp;D Center on October 24, 2023: &quot;BYD (002594.SZ) first coverage report: Cost is the shield, technology is the spear, and the sword points at the global automotive leader&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On page 26 of the research report, in order to present the output power of BYD&#39;s Yi Sifang four-wheel motor, Western Securities compared the output power, engine, and body of BYD&#39;s U8 and T-90 main battle tanks. , amphibious, on-site U-turn, lateral travel, zero-hundred acceleration and the number of driving wheels, and concluded: &quot;The technical indicators of Yi Sifang&#39;s four-wheel motor are comprehensively leading the industry.&quot; Looking up at the amphibious and lateral travel functions of U8, T -90 tanks are &quot;none&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Blue Whale Finance, a relevant person from Western Securities responded that the report was not written by an intern, and that the comparison of BYD’s U8 with main battle tanks was affected by relevant publicity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is the impact of relevant publicity? Previously, many self-media compared BYD’s U8 with tanks. Regardless of whether the research report of Western Securities was influenced by self-media, but comparing electric vehicles with main battle tanks, and then claiming that its technical indicators are comprehensively leading the industry, whether the relevant arguments and conclusions are rigorous and reasonable will naturally be questioned by investors and public opinion. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, in June this year, Western Securities and analysts were punished for research reports. According to the warning letter from the Shaanxi Supervision Bureau of the China Securities Regulatory Commission: After investigation, the internal control mechanism for the securities research report publishing business of Western Securities is not sound, individual surveys did not fulfill the pre-approval procedures, sales staff participated in the assessment of research report analysts, and compliance management did not cover expert consulting services. The main business links; the quality control and review of research reports are not strict, and some research reports have unreasonable valuation forecasts and imprudent conclusions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The relevant securities research report produced by Luo Yamein, the signed analyst of BYD’s research report, has problems such as imprudent research methods, lack of reasonable justification for some assumptions, and insufficient basis for some conclusions. Not only was it shown The warning letter is also recorded in the securities and futures market integrity files. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Less than half a year later, Western Securities and the same analyst released another controversial research report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, this was not done by a securities firm called Western Securities. In recent years, there have been numerous cases of securities companies being fined for &quot;weird research reports&quot;. On December 30, 2021, the Jiangxi Securities Regulatory Bureau issued two law enforcement documents, punishing Guosheng Securities and its researchers for their conduct related to the research report &quot;A Preliminary Study on the Application of Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches in Timing&quot;. On October 18 of that year, a report titled &quot;A Preliminary Study on the Application of Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches in Timing&quot; by Guosheng Securities attracted public attention. In the report, it is explained in detail how the &quot;Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches&quot; dominate the market&#39;s time cycle, and how to apply the &quot;Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches&quot; in timing. Liu Fubing, who issued this research report, has been in the industry for more than 12 years and has been listed as the best analyst of New Fortune 8 times, including No. 1 6 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If we say that the above-mentioned research report is &quot;even if it is not shocking, it will never stop&quot;, so it has become a talking point for people. There is also a type of &quot;weird research reports&quot; that are more likely to mislead investors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2020, the Jiangsu Securities Regulatory Bureau posted an administrative penalty decision against two analysts Ma Haobo who signed the research report &quot;Fucheng In-depth Report 2: Three 10 billion to support doubling of market value&quot; , Tang Weiliang were fined a total of 200,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2016, a research report released by Soochow Securities boldly predicted that Fucheng Shares (600965.SH), &quot;the number one A-share funeral stock&quot;, would be the absolute leader in the funeral industry in the future. And gave Fucheng shares a &quot;buy&quot; rating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, on October 25 of that year, Fucheng Shares issued a &quot;clarification announcement&quot; to clarify the relevant contents of the research report. Soochow Securities&#39; &quot;Fucheng Research Report&quot; stated that the number of tombs after the completion of the third phase of Fucheng&#39;s pagoda cemetery will reach 400,000. Based on this data, it was concluded that Fucheng&#39;s net profit would be 15.5 billion yuan. After investigation, Fucheng Co., Ltd.&#39;s pagoda cemetery plans to build about 125,000 tombs. &quot;Fucheng Research Report&quot; also stated that the industrial merger and acquisition fund jointly established by Fucheng Co., Ltd. and an investment company has a total scale of 10 billion yuan. The current scale is 1 billion yuan, and the follow-up fund scale will be 9 billion yuan. After investigation, as of October 2016, the size of the above-mentioned M&amp;A fund was only 1 billion yuan. The status of subsequent funds will need to be made by Fucheng Shares based on the progress of the first-phase fund and the quality of the assets acquired. Third, &quot;Fucheng Research Report&quot; stated that the company&#39;s major shareholders have 10 billion in cash and have sufficient funds to serve as the backend of the above-mentioned merger and acquisition funds. After investigation, as of October 2016, the major shareholders had not made a decision in this regard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the research report released by Soochow Securities, the relevant cited data are far from the actual data of Fucheng Shares. I am afraid that the source of the information and whether the data has been investigated and verified are all a mess. How can a research report like this deserve market credibility? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called research reports are analysis reports prepared by financial institutions such as securities companies, fund companies, banks, etc. They mainly include company analysis reports, industry analysis reports, investment strategy reports, etc. The purpose of the research report is to help investors better understand the market, the company, and the industry so that they can be used as a reference when investing. However, the content is full of errors and omissions, pointing the research direction towards Feng Shui, or making gimmicks of comparing electric vehicles with main battle tanks, which reflects that some brokers do not pay attention to the professionalism of the research report, and even use the research report as a tool for speculation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The motivation behind securities firms’ “weird research reports” cannot simply be attributed to sensationalism. In financial markets, information release is a form of power to some extent. Therefore, regulatory authorities have corresponding standards for financial institutions, listed companies, and media to release various types of investment-oriented information. As a professional information provider, the research report of securities firms affects investors&#39; decisions to a fairly extent. However, in the process of pursuing so-called market influence, some securities companies make some shocking remarks to attract attention and attention. There will be traffic or profit considerations, and they may even interfere or distort market trends. Since brokerages are also one of the important stock holders in the stock market, if a brokerage publishes a research report that is &quot;bullish&quot; or &quot;short&quot; on a listed company or a certain sector in an exaggerated way, and secretly buys or sells the corresponding stocks, wouldn&#39;t it be typical? Manipulating the stock market behavior? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, regulatory authorities have also promulgated relevant new management policies many times in recent years. In May last year, the regulatory authorities sent the &quot;Notice on the &quot;Double Random&quot; On-site Inspection of the Securities Research Report Business to all securities firms. The report shows that in 2022, a special &quot;double random&quot; on-site inspection of research and reporting business will be carried out in the entire industry, covering a total of 45 securities companies and 300 research reports. In September of that year, the China Securities Association reiterated the self-regulatory management of the securities research business of securities firms, including that holdings of more than 1% of the research target stocks must be disclosed and that reverse operations are not allowed within two trading days of the release of the research report; however, various management measures do not seem to hinder The continuation of &quot;Weird Research Reports&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This shows that for strange research reports, the regulatory authorities’ punishment and supervision need to be strengthened. Warning letters, inclusion in integrity files, etc. cannot touch the core interests of relevant personnel and securities companies, so that they would rather have short-term market effects than adhere to compliance. Only by clarifying the responsibilities of securities firms in the production and release of research reports and continuing to increase penalties for violations can the regulatory authorities stop the vicious cycle of &quot;bad coins eliminating good coins&quot; in securities firms&#39; research reports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the personal point of view of the author, does not represent the position of this newspaper) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>; &lt;br>; &lt;hr>; &lt;div>; Get more RSS: &lt;br>; &lt;a href = &quot;&quot; https://feedx.net &quot;style =&quot; color: orange &quot;target =&quot; _blank &quot;>; https://feedx.net &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href =&quot; https://feedx.best &quot;style = &quot;COLOR: Orange&quot; target = &quot;_blank&quot;>; https://feedx.best &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[18亿元起拍，衡阳政务数据资源特许经营权转让为何暂停？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260897]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;This round of transfers in Hengyang is considered the &quot;first sale&quot; of government data and has attracted widespread attention.

Resources include information resources collected by various government departments directly or through third parties in accordance with the law, authorized and managed in accordance with the law, and information resources formed by relying on the government information system to perform their duties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Encourage the open utilization of information under the conditions of ensuring data security, personal privacy and corporate commercial confidentiality.&quot; The management measures state that it is necessary to promote the registration and confirmation of open data, value assessment and other work, and actively explore the data market operations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The management measures state that public data that involves national security, business secrets and personal privacy, or that is not allowed to be opened in accordance with laws, regulations and other regulations, are parts that are not allowed to be opened. Any leakage of state secrets, work secrets, business secrets and personal privacy will be dealt with in accordance with the National Secrets Law and relevant regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2023, Guizhou issued a document requiring that big data authorities at all levels authorize qualified market entities to operate government data at the same level and develop data that does not involve state secrets, commercial secrets, or personal privacy.

Staff from the Hengyang Administrative Approval Service Bureau did not respond. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, the pricing of data resources is an industry problem. In February 2023, Zhao Jingwu, associate professor at Beihang University School of Law, wrote an article stating that data valuation indicators are not unified and data quality standards are difficult to determine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He believes that even in general data trading activities, the so-called market pricing is just the result of self-negotiation between the parties to the transaction.

On November 16, at the main forum of the 2023 China Data Element Industry Innovation Conference, Wang Jiandong, deputy director of the Price Monitoring Center of the National Development and Reform Commission, said, “Before the end of this year or early next year, management measures for government-guided pricing of public data may be introduced. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The official website of Hengyang Public Resources Trading Center shows that the return mechanism of the government data resource franchise project is “user pays”.

However, the official website did not announce the specific number of years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One interviewee’s company is responsible for building a government data platform for a southern province.

This year, Bian Jianlin turns 70. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At two o&#39;clock in the afternoon on October 18, 2023, Bian Jianlin appeared at the door of the office of China University of Political Science and Law on time. He was tall and thin, wearing a fitted black casual suit and a trousers. He was wearing trousers and holding a red paper bag in his hand, which contained three volumes of &quot;Governing the Country by Law and Criminal Procedure - Collected Works of Bian Jianlin&#39;s Legal Studies&quot;. For his 70th birthday this month, the publisher specially planned this collection of essays. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1979, eight years after graduating from high school, Bian Jianlin left his hometown in Jiangsu and entered Beijing Political Science and Law School, which had just resumed school after the Cultural Revolution. College, which is now China University of Political Science and Law. Relying on employee scholarships provided by the state, Bian Jianlin completed his bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s degrees. Just before life was about to reach another fork in the road, &quot;a major event happened.&quot; In 1986, the third batch of law doctoral programs in the country was confirmed, and two law professors from China University of Political Science and Law were appointed as doctoral supervisors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1987, Bian Jianlin studied under Professor Chen Guangzhong, who is recognized as the &quot;founder of criminal procedure law&quot; in China. Four years later, he became the first doctoral student in criminal procedural law independently trained by the People&#39;s Republic of China, and embarked on a career development path similar to that of his mentor. To date, Bian Jianlin has trained 87 doctors and 11 postdoctoral fellows. He also serves as the honorary dean of the Procedural Law Institute of China University of Political Science and Law, the executive director and academic committee member of the China Law Society, and the honorary president of the China Criminal Procedural Law Research Association. He works as a professor at Jilin University, Wuhan University, Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, East China University of Political Science and Law, Northwest University of Political Science and Law, People&#39;s Public Security University of China, and National Prosecutor&#39;s College. On social media, he always actively participates in various seminars and academic lectures to share his understanding and suggestions on the construction of the criminal procedure system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Unwilling to flaunt himself, Bian Jianlin almost never talks about his past experiences in public. Even in this two-hour interview, the topic never got around to his mentor. And he himself seemed to be just an ordinary student who was &quot;older and started school late&quot;, and he was lucky enough to get to where he is now by accident. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Accidentally became the &quot;first&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong >;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the preface of the anthology, it seems that this is the first time you mentioned your experiences as a student. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I don’t like to talk about my resume. This collection of essays has a profound impact on my academic work. It means life summary, so I said a few words in the preface. I was admitted early at the University of Political Science and Law, and was in the first class after the school was re-established. However, compared with other scholars who entered earlier, I was still relatively older when I entered. Fortunately, I completed my bachelor&#39;s degree, master&#39;s degree and Ph.D. in one go, so I gained some time back. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; What were you doing before you were admitted to the Beijing University of Political Science and Law in 1979? How did you think of studying law? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After graduating from high school in 1971, I went to work in a provincial factory. Later, the college entrance examination was resumed, but after all, it was not a required option. Very few of my high school classmates went on to college. At that time, everyone had a job and even got married and had children. But I still have a little bit of ambition, and I have such an ambition to take the exam. As for studying law, it is almost an inevitable choice. First of all, during the ten years of turmoil, our generation was wasted. Basically, we did not learn mathematics, physics and chemistry, and we were seriously partial to subjects. It was not easy to take the science and engineering exams, so we had to choose from liberal arts. Foreign languages, Chinese, history and law, among which law is definitely the most attractive. The main reason is that many of the books I read in the past were about solving crimes, about identifying doubts and clearing grievances, punishing evil and eradicating evil, and upholding justice, so I naturally developed a legal feeling. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Why study Criminal Procedure Law? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When I was an undergraduate, the school had only one law major, and there was no further subdivision. major. When I was about to graduate, I decided to take the postgraduate entrance examination. According to my personality and interests, I didn’t really like civil law. What I liked most was the “study of criminal justice”, so my major choice should be criminal law. However, there is a certain degree of chance in choosing criminal procedure law. The school&#39;s master&#39;s entrance exams for Criminal Procedure Law and Criminal Law only differed in one subject, Criminal Procedure Archeology Chinese, while Criminal Law was the history of the legal system. In the year of the postgraduate entrance examination, I went home to celebrate the Spring Festival. After the Spring Festival, I had to take the exam. I thought that I would have to work hard to prepare for the legal history course, and there is always some basic knowledge in ancient Chinese, so it was just a matter of thought. The choice of exam subjects suddenly determined the direction of my major, so it was not that I realized the procedure from that time on. value and importance, because in fact substantive law was still ranked ahead of procedural law at that time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Law is a practical subject. During your studies, didn’t you ever think about getting into practice? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;To learn the law, you must use it. Logically speaking, you have to work in the practical department , plus I was relatively old when I entered school. At that time, a bachelor&#39;s degree was enough, and I also studied for a master&#39;s degree. So I faced two choices at the time. One was to follow my family&#39;s wishes and return to Jiangsu. The Provincial High School wanted to recruit a Mature judges are more interested in me; if they stay in Beijing, they want to go to the Interpol China National Central Bureau through an old leader of the Ministry of Public Security. I did have some thoughts, but in the end both options were given up, and they were not implemented to the extent of signing a contract. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Why gave up? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 1986, before I graduated with my master’s degree, the school was approved for two doctoral programs, including Two teachers were identified as doctoral supervisors, namely Professor Wang Xuan and Professor Chen Guangzhong. Teacher Chen is responsible for the litigation law major. They are also the first batch of doctoral supervisors at China University of Political Science and Law. After receiving the PhD approval, Teacher Chen once talked to me. First, he told me that I had the opportunity to continue my studies; second, he expressed his affirmation to me. After Teacher Chen chatted with me, I was more tempted, although I didn’t fully appreciate the school’s advantages at the time. The most important thing is that my nature is that I am always uneasy about the status quo and have an upward spirit. I have never thought of being rich and settling down. In this way, I decided to continue studying for a Ph.D. after graduating with a master’s degree. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; You obtained your master&#39;s degree in 1986 and your doctoral program was approved in the same year. How come it was only a year later that you started studying for your Ph.D.? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I started preparing for the Ph.D. exam before and after I graduated with my master’s degree. However, although the doctoral program was approved at that time, there were insufficient preparations for public announcements and enrollment listings. Due to various reasons, neither doctoral program enrolled students that year. However, Teacher Chen happened to be the deputy dean of the Graduate School at the time, and the school established a new research institution, the Chinese Legal Research Institute, with Teacher Chen also serving as the director. So I stayed in school and worked at the China Legal Research Institute, doing full-time research, doing projects, and writing articles. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; How many doctoral students studied with you under Professor Chen? Why were you the first doctoral student to graduate? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Frankly speaking, in the first year of enrollment, the instructor has candidates in mind , but you still have to follow the formal process when applying. At that time, unlike now, the papers were basically judged on the spot after the exam, and the results were known quickly. Finally, Teacher Chen recruited me, and also recruited someone from our school. He was a master&#39;s student in criminal law in 1984, just one class after me. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Speaking of this, it is also a coincidence. If the school had recruited doctors in 1986, he had not graduated with a master&#39;s degree at that time, and we would not be classmates. . However, although we are both in the first batch of doctoral students, he is a full-time student, while I am a part-time PhD student because I have already stayed in school to work. According to the country&#39;s degree regulations at that time, those studying for a PhD on the job would have to study longer than those studying full-time. As for how long, there is no clear regulation. So I extended my studies by one year and graduated in 4 years. If calculated according to this time, it is possible that he graduated before me, then I will not become the first doctorate in criminal procedural law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But the students in the same class later went to study in the United States and never came back, leaving me alone to hold on. Later, I joked that if he didn&#39;t leave, he would definitely graduate before me, and the title of the first doctor of litigation law would belong to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Follow the teacher&#39;s steps&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekends:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The first batch of 18 Ph.D.s was produced in 1983, but the first recipient of a doctorate in law was graduated in 1987. Among all disciplines, law is not a niche, and it is not too early to cultivate a doctorate in law. What do you think?&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think the reason for getting a doctorate in law is a little later. First, the doctoral program was of high value at that time. At that time, the approval of the doctoral program and the determination of the doctoral supervisor required the approval of the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council, which was very strictly controlled. The second reason is that from the perspective of teachers and the level of research, the law of law was also a scarce discipline at the time, and did not have the conditions for training doctors. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; In 1988, Professor Chen Guangzhong edited the book &quot;Comparative Research on Foreign Criminal Proceedings&quot;. Three years later, your doctoral thesis &quot;Comparative Research on Criminal Prosecution Systems&quot; was approved. From a professional research perspective, did Professor Chen have a great influence on you? big? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Teacher Chen has always attached great importance to understanding and learning from foreign litigation systems. When we were still studying for master&#39;s degrees, there was a very lack of teaching materials. Basically, each school compiled and printed its own teaching materials. It happened that when Mr. Chen was the deputy dean of graduate students, he brought a topic from the Institute of Law of the Academy of Social Sciences on foreign criminal litigation. A comparative study of procedures. At that time, reform and opening up had already begun, and we were encouraged to study China&#39;s issues from a global perspective. Based on a group of experts from the Law Institute, Teacher Chen recruited some scholars from our school and other schools who studied this field to work together on this work. . Several of our classmates who are still studying for master&#39;s degrees also participated in part of it. I participated in writing a chapter, that is, compulsory medical measures, but I did not sign my name separately. I completed it under the guidance of my supervisor. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, this book was the first domestic comparative and systematic study of foreign criminal procedure. It was both authoritative and precious. If you want to know more about it, If you know something about it abroad, you must read this book. For those of us who participated in writing this book, because writing required research on foreign materials, only the University of Political Science and Law had this condition at the time, so it was the first step for me to broaden my academic horizons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the previous In an article, you called Professor Chen &quot;the leading figure in criminal procedure law in New China.&quot; Do you have any observations about his academic studies and his conduct as a person? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Teacher Chen is a recognized master and an important founder and leader of our discipline. people. I feel that my husband&#39;s biggest specialty in learning is to learn from the best of other schools, to be open to all rivers, and to be tolerant, so later on he suddenly surpassed other teachers of his generation and was beyond the reach of others; the second is to know people and make good use of them, and make full use of their talents. Every time he writes something or works on a project, he can always hand over the relevant content to the most suitable person; the third thing is to be able to pay attention to and accept new things, and constantly improve himself by guiding students. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition to learning, the teacher also has a strong sense of responsibility and mission. He cares about current affairs and is now 93 years old. He is still paying attention to social phenomena and judicial practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Professor Chen’s Do personal traits influence you? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Mr. Chen has had a great influence on me. Over the years, I can say that I have been closely related to him. He followed suit every step of the way. In addition to the master-disciple relationship, my position also determines why my behavior, knowledge and knowledge are closer to those of my husband. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; You and Professor Chen have been promoting the localization and application of some overseas experiences. In this process, what impact has reform and opening up had? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Mr. Chen is an iconic figure in the field of criminal procedure law in my country. The development and improvement of the criminal procedure system can be said to have made a great contribution and deserved the most credit. In terms of participation in legislation, when the Criminal Procedure Law was formulated in 1979, there were relatively few scholars involved. Mr. Chen was still in Guangxi at that time. I feel that this was his regret. The revision of the Criminal Procedure Law in 1996 was an opportunity to make amends, and Mr. Chen played a great role in the revision of the law. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I still remember that in the winter of 1992, after Mr. Chen became the president of China University of Political Science and Law, his first symposium was held at the school. In the now demolished international student building, the director of the Criminal Law Office of the Legal Affairs Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress came with the director. At that time, the law was being revised. In 1993, because I assisted Mr. Chen in promoting the first revision of the Criminal Procedure Law, I was sent to study at New York University as a core member of the research team. Later, I participated in an inspection delegation led by Mr. Chen to several European countries. The director of the Criminal Law Office of the Legal Affairs Commission also participated in the inspection. After returning to China, the Legal Affairs Committee formally sent a letter to the school, entrusting Mr. Chen to lead a research team to provide opinions on the revision of the law. A year later, Mr. Chen’s research team submitted a 350,000-word “Recommendation Draft for the Criminal Procedure Law of the People’s Republic of China” to the Legal Affairs Commission, of which 65% of the provisions were absorbed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition to domestic projects, I assisted Mr. Chen in conducting some international exchanges and cooperation and conducting some comparative law research. For example, it selects students to study abroad, translates and publishes the criminal procedure codes of some representative countries, promotes the implementation of international human rights conventions and United Nations criminal justice guidelines in China, etc. It should be said that it has done a lot of useful things to promote the development and improvement of my country&#39;s criminal procedure system, and also promoted the discipline construction and talent cultivation of procedural law at China University of Political Science and Law. These were unique to the University of Political Science and Law at that time. Other schools neither had this team strength nor the necessary conditions and capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Amending the Constitution in 2004 At that time, Professor Chen proposed that &quot;the state respects and protects human rights&quot; be written into the Constitution; in 2012, when the Criminal Procedure Law was revised for the second time, this article was written into the Criminal Procedure Law. As his student, you have always advocated that criminal procedure law should protect individual rights. Why have you been so concerned about this issue? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Human rights protection is very closely related to criminal proceedings. Criminal procedure law is a typical field where public power operates and an important tool for national governance. For a long time, influenced by concepts, systems and even ideologies, we have regarded criminal proceedings as a contest between the state and crime, emphasizing the punishment of crimes, resulting in the lack of effective restrictions on the power of specialized state agencies in litigation activities. Correspondingly, the rights and interests of criminal suspects, defendants and other litigation participants cannot be fully protected. From the perspective of social development trends, the country&#39;s comprehensive promotion of governing the country according to law and building a country ruled by law means regulating public power through the rule of law and procedures to prevent power from being alienated and abused. Mr. Chen has a full understanding of this and has done a lot of work , through their own efforts to strengthen human rights protection in the judiciary, influence legislation, and improve the judiciary. Under the leadership of Mr. Chen, we have also made our own efforts and contributions to this end. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&quot;It is not enough to do it yourself&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; &quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In a previous school lecture, you and the students discussed the vindication of unjust, false and wrongful convictions. Judging from past news reports, lawyers representing many cases are known as &quot;hard-nosed lawyers&quot;. What do you think of this group? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The defense system and the lawyer profession reflect the level of the rule of law in a country. If the level of lawyers in a country is very weak and the defense system is not perfect, it is impossible to progress in criminal litigation. When the Criminal Procedure Law was formulated in 1979, there were basically no lawyers. Interim Regulations on Lawyers were only introduced in 1980. Therefore, the legislative provisions on lawyer defense are relatively backward. However, several revisions to the Criminal Procedure Law since 1996 have improved the lawyer defense system. Overall, the progress of the defense system is obvious to all. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But at the same time, it should be noted that there are still many problems in the legal provisions regarding lawyer defense, especially in judicial practice. I think one of the important reasons is that we have not found an accurate positioning of the lawyer profession and lawyer defense. In criminal proceedings, the defense lawyer&#39;s duty is to defend the defendant, find faults and discover problems from various angles such as facts, evidence, legal application, procedural operation, etc., so as to promote the fair handling of the case and thereby improve the level of the rule of law. By nature, lawyers do not exercise public power and are not members of the case-handling agency. Our management of lawyers is different. Lawyers are managed by judicial administrative agencies, which are part of the specialized state agencies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In judicial practice, in order to provide effective defense, to protect the legitimate rights and interests of the parties, or to ensure that legal procedures are complied with, lawyers need to be more truthful when performing their defense duties. Sometimes there are conflicts with the case-handling agencies, so some lawyers are called &quot;die-hard lawyers.&quot; But if they are not serious and fight to the death, they will not be able to protect the interests of the parties involved, and they will not be able to carry out defense work normally. Recently, some extreme examples have occurred, such as a court in Laibin, Guangxi, which forced lawyers to undergo security checks, made things difficult for them, and violated their legitimate rights and interests. This had a very bad impact, which attracted the attention of people across the country and was named by the Supreme Court. I think after such an extreme thing happens, the entire court system should take a warning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Seems like this contradiction This is found in many of our legal systems. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It is not enough to do it yourself. The law on the paper is to become the law in the action, and it really takes time, and various problems will occur during the execution process. In a certain sense, many of the problems or difficulties faced in my country&#39;s current judicial practice are caused by the development of the system. Some things that seem good are actually very difficult to do. It may touch the interests of some people and even intensify conflicts. I believe that problems in development must still be solved by development. On the one hand, we must know more about the situation and pay attention to practice when designing the system; on the other hand, once the law is revised, the authority of the law must be maintained, and the case-handling agencies must strictly enforce the law. Take the lead in abiding by the law and earnestly abide by the procedures prescribed by law. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; In the past, everyone said that law is a humanities and social science, but now it is said that law is an engineering discipline within the humanities and social sciences. What do you think of this view? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There is no doubt that law is a humanities and social science, at least a discipline, or It is science, and it does have some attributes of engineering. Especially our discipline is very applicable and operable. When we studied in the past, we studied &quot;Criminal Procedure Law&quot;, but now it is called &quot;Criminal Procedure Law&quot;. The addition of the word &quot;study&quot; actually means that we realize that this is a science and a knowledge system. It is not just about interpreting the meaning of the law, but also using it to govern society and achieve good results. Taking the ascertainment of case facts as an example, it is not only an epistemological issue, but also involves axiology and methodology. Due procedures must be used to regulate the exercise of power by the case-handling agencies. Generally speaking, procedural law is an operational norm. It must have a specific set of principles, rules, methods, procedures and institutional norms, and it must be meticulous and operable, so that litigation activities can be followed by law. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; With more than 40 years of study and academic experience, do you have any experience that you can share with young students? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Whether I am a scholar or a teacher, I actually learned from Mr. Chen , he set an example for us, teaching us to be patriotic and caring for the people, to have an open vision, and to have a spirit of research. This is what I strive to follow when doing academic work. In addition, I often remind students to care about current affairs and pay attention to the present. Many things happen around us every day, or there are examples closely related to our profession every day. Don&#39;t turn a deaf ear or be indifferent. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As for how to learn and how to write articles, this is indeed not an easy task. I think that first of all, individuals need to work hard, and at the same time, they also need opportunities. When we were studying, we should say that there were more opportunities. There was a shortage of people in front of us because of the passing of generations, and the society was in urgent need of talents, so that we would be the first in this and the first in that way. Nowadays, law has become a prominent school. Young people are under great pressure, but there are not many opportunities. Then they need to be more diligent, redouble their efforts, be calm, endure loneliness, and never let go of their youth. If they really learn, they will achieve something. There are times when you can use force and give appropriate rewards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 11:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[《等待戈多》作者最喜欢的戏剧来中国，观众看得很精神]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260887]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A black box stood on the stage. &quot;Endgame&quot; had not officially started, but the two characters were already inside. Extremely similar clips are repeated over and over again, as if the stage has turned into a machine that plays on a loop due to malfunction. The servant Clover wrung his fingers and walked the same route repeatedly with a strange gait. He stepped back from the door to the right of Master Ham&#39;s wheelchair, walked to the corner on the left, and then to the door on the right, taking fourteen precise steps, every time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The dialogue has not changed either. &quot;Do you want me to leave you?&quot; &quot;Of course.&quot; &quot;Then I will leave you.&quot; &quot;You can&#39;t leave me.&quot; &quot;Then I won&#39;t leave you.&quot; The door was opened and closed again and again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1953, &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; brought Beckett worldwide fame, but his favorite work was &quot;Endgame&quot; written four years later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/9nCi5R8eQ6GQ8MC2uGTpV2Pz4rT7J40RVwMq7Zrj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/9nCi5R8eQ6GQ8MC2uGTpV2Pz4rT7J40RVwMq7Zrj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258749&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Beckett&#39;s play &quot;Endgame&quot; will be performed at the 10th Wuzhen International Theater Festival in 2023. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the organizer)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This play shows four deformed people in an empty house that is approaching the end of the world. : The master Ham is paralyzed from the lower body, blind, and has been sitting in a wheelchair; the servant Clover has a disease in his knees and cannot sit down. Ham&#39;s parents, Nag and Nell, have lost their lower limbs and live in two trash cans. The relationships between masters and servants, husbands and wives, and parents and children all show an extremely cruel side, but they are interdependent and inseparable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the impression of Tobias Bianconi, Director General of the International Theater Association, in the past, the audience&#39;s reaction to Beckett and even absurdist plays was sometimes &quot;very frustrating and unhappy&quot;, but After he walked out of the theater, he found that after watching this version of the Vienna Volkstheater&#39;s performance, the Chinese audience was full of energy and had lively discussions. They all felt that the play was very fresh. &quot;Why is there such a reaction? What is the background that makes the audience like this play so much?&quot; he was curious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 20th century, which experienced the ravages of two world wars and was immersed in industrialization and the post-industrial era, the rationalism admired by Western civilization fell into crisis, belief in God collapsed, and self-doubt and self-denial became the themes of the times. This also brought profound conceptual changes to drama. What Beckett&#39;s drama expresses is the antagonistic relationship between human beings and nature, society, self and others who are completely alienated in social crisis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Absurd drama, which was born in Paris, France, in the early 1950s, was echoed again in Wuzhen, China, seventy years later. &quot;At the beginning, we thought the most exciting thing was this very unhealthy and toxic relationship. Later we discovered that it had some parts related to war. As it slowly developed, we found that it might be related to climate change. Recently, We found that it was combined with the COVID-19 epidemic.&quot; During the dialogue, theater director and German director Kai Vogels said that this version of &quot;Endgame&quot; has been performed for eleven years. &quot;The point of it being constantly performed is that it is always new. , what we see from this drama keeps changing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18 /yJd8u4hbNeQQHztSBQk6L0OvaD60hZLYPPyafubF.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/yJd8u4hbNeQQHztSBQk6L0OvaD60hZLYPPyafubF.j pg&quot; data -key=&quot;258748&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Beckett&#39;s play &quot;Endgame&quot; was written in the late 1950s. The version that came to China has already been sold in Europe Acted for eleven years. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the organizer)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Vogels refined the four characters into two clown-like people, retaining the main theme A very tense contrast between servants: Ham is physically disabled, but has the power to control Clover; Clough is relatively able to move freely, but is always dominated by his master to do unnecessary trivial things, and his spirit tends to be paralyzed. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most eye-catching adaptation is Vogels’ emphasis on the sense of looping. The line, which was on an infinite loop before the show even started, only appeared once in the original script. Vogels uses this as the opening or closing line of every dialogue, repeating it a dozen times throughout the play. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A new plot in the play brings an &quot;anti-climax&quot;: after Clover struggled, he shot Hamm, but the expected relief brought by death did not happen. After the monologue, Ham suddenly answered and got up from the ground, as if nothing had happened. Clover and he returned to their usual endless conversation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Beckett actually demonstrated a ritual cycle on the stage. The ending of this ritual cycle is satisfaction, nothingness, or the end of the world. Everyone can see it differently. Each point has its own interpretation, and what I present on the stage also has this meaning.&quot; At the beginning of the rehearsal, Vogels hoped to show the inextricable cycle of repetition on the stage without making the audience feel bored. This balance Feeling is what he is looking for. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 1998 Vogels has been a theater and opera director in Austria and Germany. German theater is relatively lagging behind in digital innovation. From 2010 to 2020, while serving as the artistic director of the Dortmund Theater in Germany, Vogels began to try to combine digital media with theater and introduce digital thinking to the theater stage. He is a pioneer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among these works, digital techniques such as VR, real-time imaging, and on-site editing are emerging in endlessly. &quot;Endgame&quot; pursues Beckett&#39;s minimalist style. However, the artificially isolated cramped space, heavy metal-style amplified sound effects, The sudden switching of dazzling lights, the characters&#39; mechanically looping movements and lines, all give this picture of the human spiritual wasteland a cold science fiction color. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The more traditional images such as &quot;desert&quot; and &quot;dead branches&quot; in Beckett&#39;s original work are missing. In terms of stage design, the play chose a form that abstracted away from reality. Like the door, the few sets and props are all outlined with white chalk lines. Three-dimensional life seems to be locked in two-dimensional space. Machine guns and toy dogs are just thin wooden boards hanging on the wall when they are not picked out by actors and held in their hands. The clock has no hands and the flowers in the vase are out of proportion. The only two real objects are the wooden chair with armrests in the center of the stage and the light bulb hanging in the air. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The actors&#39; performances are consistent with German precision, and they achieve the ultimate in repetitive movements with slight changes. The actor who played Ham sat in a chair with his eyes closed throughout the performance, but still showed a strong sense of dominance and oppression in the relationship through his tone and gestures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The voice can be called the third &quot;starring&quot; of this drama, expanding the information and emotional density in the minimalist world. Clough&#39;s footsteps continued to echo in the space, powerful, but as flat as the scenery, with no specific sense of direction. Footsteps create a strong conflict with directionlessness. Every time Clover dropped something he was holding, there was a loud cracking sound, whether it was a telescope, a machine gun, or a toy dog. The laws of the physical world break down here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two people, who are both master and servant and father and son, are imprisoned in a lifeless atmosphere. The room they were in was, in a sense, like the final game board in a chess game. Ham is the general on the chessboard and needs to ensure that he is in the &quot;center&quot; of the room, controlling his pieces. The little soldier Clover could barely move a few steps, but under the command of blind Ham, the situation was certain to lose, but they could not and did not dare to leave the room, just like the chess pieces could not leave the chessboard. &quot;There is no nature anymore&quot; outside the house. Even when I opened the window, I saw &quot;ZERO&quot; written on the blackboard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They passed the time by teasing, controlling, and torturing each other, telling the old stories again, and looking at the window that they had looked at countless times, hoping that something would happen. What happened in front of my eyes was that other people passed by the window. However, their expectations were all in vain, and all their actions no longer made much sense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the play, I realized that the beginning was the end. &quot;What time is it?&quot; &quot;Same as usual.&quot; They repeated the dialogue at the opening. Everything stopped suddenly, leaving silence and darkness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 10:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
