I sent a message to my older cousin in the countryside early in the morning to ask how my relatives in my hometown were doing. My cousin said everything was fine. He has asked his family not to wander around outside unless they have nothing to do; and for his uncle who likes to hunt wild animals in the mountains, he has been strictly forbidden to go hunting in the mountains again. &quot;My uncle is quite honest,&quot; my cousin said. This makes me a little bit unbelievable. My uncle has always been fiery, but now he is willing to listen to his cousin. It seems that his dignity as the head of the family has already been established. My cousin is very busy. He leaves early and comes home late every day. He is the barefoot doctor in the village. He has to go to the monitoring point at the entrance of the village to measure the body temperature of outsiders every day. He has a heavy responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In such a special period, there are still outsiders coming, for no other reason than that my hometown is one of the best producing areas of Pu&#39;er tea in Yunnan, and March and April are the time to start picking spring tea. In previous years, before the spring tea was picked, many foreign merchants would come to the village early to reserve tea trees and tea farmers, so that the first crop of spring tea could be purchased, packaged, and transported as soon as it was roasted. Although there are not so many people coming this year, for some people, the temptation of spring tea is still greater than the virus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/02/04/GKBNpqDRxP4vc2LgiCeJsYZbFjwjbkfejw1kFD3f.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;637&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/02/04/GKBNpqDRxP4vc2LgiCeJsYZbFjwjbkfejw1kFD3f.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;58412&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Spring in Pu&#39;er Tea Mountain. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend Information/Pictures)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pu&#39;erbanna area belongs to the middle and low mountains and hilly areas, with interspersed large and small mountain basins and The valley flats pushed out by the Lancang River and its tributary water systems in the area are the main human settlements. Because it is located inland, surrounded by mountains, and has a high quiet wind rate, the cold lake effect is prone to occur in winter. This is especially noticeable when driving on a winding mountain road. It will become hot and cold as the terrain changes, and you will also see the cold lake effect in the winter. There is thick fog at the bottom of the basin and white clouds lingering in the mountains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Xishuangbanna-Menghai-Huimin line is one of the main producing areas of Pu&#39;er tea. Mangzhi, Manzhuan, Mansa and Youle produce Pu&#39;er tea with excellent quality, and Yiwu tea is produced in Mansa. Menghai Huimin belongs to the six new tea mountains outside the Yangtze River (on the west bank of the Lancang River) - Nannuo, Hekai, Mengsong, Jingmai, Brown and Bada. The well-known Pu&#39;er tea brands &quot;Brown Mountain&quot; and &quot;Lao Banzhang&quot; are Produced in Brown Mountain, Menghai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/02/04/xyqcOrWkZO0vTxXGzd88RbCkCplOnBnTIPhwKkFp.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;549&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/02/04/xyqcOrWkZO0vTxXGzd88RbCkCplOnBnTIPhwKkFp.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;58413&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Schematic diagram of the distribution of ancient Pu&#39;er tea mountains. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend Information/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, Pu&#39;er is known as the source of tea in the world and is a famous Pu&#39;er tea town. The good Pu&#39;er tea is in Lancang, and the Jingmai-Mangjing-Manghong area in Huimin Township is one of the important producing areas of Lancang good tea. The largest ancient tea garden of 10,000 acres among the twelve major tea mountains is here here. The ancient tea garden was planted in 696 AD and has a history of more than 1,300 years. There are also many semi-wild ancient tea trees in the area. The age of the trees is unknown, but according to locals, the oldest tea tree is 1,600 years old. These ancient tea trees still produce a certain amount of output every year and are a cash cow for local villagers. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;My hometown is in a village of the Blang ethnic group&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;In the spring of about three years ago, I went back to my hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My hometown is in Manghong, a village inhabited by the Bulang people. According to the tea mountain classification, it belongs to Jingmai Mountain. The Bulang people living here are good at planting, picking and making tea. Since ancient times, Tea is not only their daily necessities, but also an important commodity in exchange for supplies. Bags of Pu&#39;er tea carried on horseback are transported from Jingmai Mountain to Pu&#39;er Prefecture, Myanmar, and Thailand. Ma Gudao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I rarely go back to my hometown. When I was a child, transportation was inconvenient—my hometown was hidden in the mountains, and the roads used to be difficult. To get from the village to the county seat, one had to walk over mountains and ridges for most of a day, catch a shuttle bus in the countryside, and then take a four- to five-hour ride. When I grew up, I had little time to go home because I studied and worked outside, let alone my hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the Spring Festival holiday that year, when they heard that I was coming back, my brother-in-law and cousin sent me a message asking me to go back and have a look. The Blang people celebrate the Water Splashing Festival in the Dai calendar year and don’t pay much attention to the Spring Festival, so I didn’t go back during the Spring Festival. Instead, I went back to my hometown with my brother and sister-in-law after Powu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I entered Mangjing from Huimin Township, I found that the road conditions were much better than a few years ago. This was all because of the Pu&#39;er tea. Anyone who sells tea knows that Pu&#39;er tea in this area is good. During the tea-picking season, merchants from all over the country come to collect tea. In order to facilitate the transportation of trucks, the government funded the construction of a road, which greatly improved the efficiency of logistics and transportation. The Blang people who grew tea became rich as a result, and the place became a well-known wealthy town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a checkpoint at the bridge that must be passed when entering Tea Mountain. Cars going out are basically ignored, but cars entering are checked very strictly. It is said to be to prevent someone from smuggling in Pu&#39;er tea of ​​average quality from other places and passing it off as local Pu&#39;er tea before selling it. Although they are in a remote area, people here have already had brand awareness and cherish their tea and brand very much, and do not allow anyone to ruin the reputation of their tea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/02/04/VMXuGJSIQJZcZ6Q0kYQ3VdEXyn7U0RzVk326YbW7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/02/04/VMXuGJSIQJZcZ6Q0kYQ3VdEXyn7U0RzVk326YbW7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;58414&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Pu&#39;er scenery. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the road conditions are completely different from those in the past, it still took four hours to reach Mang. It was already past 11 noon when we arrived at Hong Laozhai. The uncle came out from the stilted building and waved us into the house. The old house is a traditional Blang wooden house with a history of several decades. Last time I came back, my grandpa and grandma were still alive. They have passed away for a few years now, but the old house still maintains the layout and layout of the past: there is still a fire pit in the kitchen. Although the village has long started to use electricity and biogas, The fire pit still dances with flames day and night. The old people use the fire in this fire pit to bake their favorite cup of roasted tea. On winter nights, they sit around the fire pit to warm themselves up, drink tea, smoke hookahs and chat. The firepit is the soul of the home and cannot be thrown away at any time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although it is almost noon, only my uncle is at home. My cousin goes to school and has lunch at school and doesn&#39;t come back until the afternoon; my aunt goes to the mountains to pick tea and doesn&#39;t come home until the afternoon. Although the ancient tree tea has not yet reached the best time to pick, the first batch of platform tea has already begun to be picked. From this time until the end of April, it is the busiest time for the village. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Platform tea refers to Pu&#39;er tea cultivated in recent decades. Although the taste is not as mellow as accumulated through a long history, it is still a fine quality tea. No artificial fertilizer is applied, and the tea is made by the soil itself. It is nourished by the fallen leaves of ground forest trees, sunlight, rain and dew, and is also called ecological tea. A Taiwanese friend of mine once told me that Taiwan has very strict requirements for tea imports, and only completely ecological tea is allowed to be imported. The tea from my hometown is very popular among Taiwanese businessmen. A considerable part of the tea is bought by Taiwanese businessmen every year, which shows the superior quality. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Use Red Bull to relieve tea drunkenness&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Although the layout of the old house has not changed, I still found two more things. One is a huge tea table - made by my uncle himself. Judging by its size, the tree must be quite old. With the entry of tea merchants from other places, a different way of life has been brought to the village, such as drinking tea. In the past, when drinking tea, you would take a copper kettle sitting on the fire pond to boil water, grab a handful of tea in a small earthenware pot, and roast it by the pond fire. When the water boiled, the tea would also be roasted and fragrant. When you pour some water into the jar, you will have a jar of fragrant tea, with a strong and wild fragrance. This cup of tea is very fragrant, but it is also very bitter. After the bitterness, it becomes sweet again. The power of tea is also very overbearing. First-time drinkers will become drunk if they are not careful, causing shortness of breath and palpitation, which is very similar to the symptoms of hypoglycemia. The local method is to grab handfuls of uncooked rice and chew it, which is said to be very effective. Canned roasted tea is easy to get drunk when you first drink it, but it can become addictive if you drink it for a long time. In the past, people in the village rarely went outside the mountains. Traffic was one reason, and they also thought the tea outside was weak. If you have to go out, you must bring your own pre-roasted tea leaves. After drinking the tea, no matter how things go, you must go back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, the old people also pay attention to the tea ceremony when drinking tea, including tea sea, tea wash, teapot, tea rules, aroma cup, host cup, tea tasting cup, etc., and there are many of them, paying attention to water temperature and water quality. , pay attention to making soup. One move after another, the ancient village is also absorbing new knowledge and changing with the changes of the times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another change in the old house is the addition of a disinfection cabinet one person high. The Blang people themselves are a nation that loves cleanliness. As for my old house, although it is old, it is kept very neat and clean. The open-air palm (the local name for the terrace of the stilted building) is spotless, which makes people feel simple and friendly. Nowadays, the villagers are paying more and more attention to hygiene when making raw Pu&#39;er tea. Not only the houses, but also the roads in the village are still very clean, although they are still dirt roads. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After welcoming us into the old house, my uncle was not busy with anything else. He first invited us to drink tea - during the tea-picking season, almost everyone was busy in the tea mountains all day long, and there was no concept of lunch at all. The tea is spring tea that has just been picked and roasted. Although it is not ancient tree tea, it is still top quality. The uncle poured boiling water into the teapot, closed the lid and let it simmer for five or six seconds, then poured the tea into the sea of ​​tea and distributed it to us. In order to see the color of tea, my uncle specially bought a small transparent glass cup. After pouring the tea, I saw that the tea soup is clear and fresh green in color. There is a fresh bitterness in the mouth. After two cups, the sweetness comes back, and the sweetness overflows in an instant. It fills the space between the lips and teeth, and expands in waves in the mouth, like a young girl who is shy and timid when she first met, but is enthusiastic and lively after getting to know her better - I think she must be a girl from the Brown ethnic group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is said that drinking Shenpu shaving oil is very powerful. I arrived home at noon, and the breakfast in my stomach was almost digested, and my uncle was giving me a cup of tea on the left and right. Soon I had symptoms of hypoglycemia, and I slumped on the sofa and shouted for food. The uncle then suddenly realized it and patted his head and said, &quot;You are drunk with tea!&quot; Then slowly arrange the cooking. He first cooked the rice in the rice cooker, then set up a large pot on the fire pit, poured water in, pulled off a strip of bacon, chopped it into several pieces and threw it into the pot. While waiting for the water to boil, he went out like a gust of wind. After a while, my uncle came back like a gust of wind, brought back a pile of Red Bull and put it in front of me and said, drink some first, and you will not be drunk after drinking tea. I opened a can and drank it, and I felt better - it seems that Zuicha no longer chews uncooked rice, but drinks Red Bull instead. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My uncle thrust Red Bull into my hand and ran out to get lunch. He grabbed a chicken from the chicken coop and killed it, then chopped it into pieces. When the water in the pot boiled, he poured them all into the pot, added seasoning salt, stirred a few times, covered the pot and continued to simmer. ; He also took out a large bowl of water pickled vegetables from the pickled vegetable jar, mixed some with soy sauce and chili for cold dressing, and chopped some into pieces and stir-fried with the turtle dove meat. At two o&#39;clock in the afternoon, we finally had a belated lunch - free-range chicken cooked with bacon, mixed with pickled vegetables, and stir-fried turtle doves with pickled vegetables. The food cooked over a firewood was particularly fragrant. I ate it with gusto and kept enough to eat. Two bowls of rice. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Our ancient tree tea&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;After dinner, my eldest cousin happened to come back from get off work at the village clinic. He said hello to his uncle and said to me, Sister, do you want to see our tea garden? I said yes. The cousin and his uncle went downstairs to start the motorcycle. Manghong Village is built in the mountains. The roads in the village are not wide and the slopes are very undulating. It is not possible to ride bicycles. The daily means of transportation is motorcycles. Every household has at least one or two motorcycles. My cousin drove me along a thin yellow winding dirt road toward the mountains, followed by my brother-in-law and my brother. When we reached a slightly flat spot halfway up the mountain, my cousin stopped the motorcycle and led me to the roadside. He pointed to me not far down the mountain and said, &quot;Sister, look, that&#39;s our village!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is early spring at 4:30 in the afternoon. The sun has turned slightly yellow, the sky is clear and the light is soft. Under the blue sky, stilted buildings with sloping roofs on all sides are scattered in an orderly manner, among the smoky bamboo canopies and banana trees. Under the cover, it undulates intermittently and extends to the mountains on the opposite side, showing a quiet rural style. My cousin said that this is his favorite place. He usually stops to take a look when he passes by the tea farm. When nothing happens, he will also come here to stand for a while. &quot;This is the village where I grew up. Our ancestors were all born and buried here. There is no better place than here,&quot; the cousin said. We looked at it for a while, then my cousin waved me into the car and continued driving up. After turning a few more turns, my cousin stopped the car again and said, &quot;We&#39;re here.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/ 02/04/H3lU50w9mcJSHm6oFrojMJPnRP6mf3ZfyfGJVc6B.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/02/04/H3lU50w9mcJSHm6oFrojMJPnRP6 mf3ZfyfGJVc6B. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;58415&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Mountain village. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a hillside that looks like an undisturbed mountain forest, with thick and thin trees growing intricately. Trees, shrubs and some vines of varying heights. Between the tall trees and low shrubs, there are tea trees about 2 meters high. Among the dark green adult leaves, new green pointed leaves are piercing out like swords. They will be picked in a few days; Qiu The curved branches are covered with mottled layers of moss, as if they are the sedimented remains of time; the moss grows and withers season after season, and a thin layer of moss soil accumulates on the tea branches, becoming a place for parasitic plants to settle down. Here, as long as the Pu&#39;er tea trees grow to a certain age, there will be a parasitic plant called &quot;crab legs&quot;. The scientific name of crab legs is liquidambar mistletoe, which is very effective in treating rheumatic joint pain, lumbar muscle strain and acute cystitis. When tea leaves sprout, it is also the flowering and fruiting stage of crab legs. They grow in clusters among the tea branches, often causing the tea buds to fail to grow. Yunnan ancient tree Pu&#39;er tea is a large-leaf tree tea with tall plants. It is not easy to remove crab legs. Therefore, in the past, it was an annoying parasitic plant for tea farmers. Nowadays, crab legs are widely sought after, and the price is more expensive than ordinary Pu&#39;er tea, which can easily cost one thousand yuan per catty. Tea farmers often regard crab legs as a by-product of tea, which is another considerable income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My cousin proudly pointed to these tea trees and said: &quot;Sister, these are our treasures, ancient tea trees! Look at these tea trees with particularly strong branches. This one is more than 300 years old. , that one is 500 years old, and that one over there is the &quot;Tea Soul Tree&quot; of this tea field. The old people in the village said it is at least 800 years old. They said they were planted when the tea field first opened... These tea trees I They are all numbered, picked separately every year, and fried separately, which can be sold at a very good price.&quot; The so-called &quot;tea soul tree&quot; is the first tea tree planted in each tea field. How old is the tea garden? No matter how old it is, the tea garden has disappeared, but maybe the tree is still there... The tea soul tree is the soul of the tea garden. It transforms into a god and protects the tea garden. Therefore, a tea festival, called &quot;Tea Soul&quot;, is held every April. , not only does each family have to sacrifice their own tea soul tree, but the village also invites the Big Buddha and respected old people to preside over a grand ceremony to sacrifice the tea soul and call the tea god. In addition to these ancient tea trees, which are hailed as &quot;treasures&quot; by my cousin, the &quot;main force&quot; of this tea land is composed of tea trees that are about 200 years old. The scattered small tea trees are made from cuttings of the branches of ancient trees. They inherit It has the characteristics of the mother tea tree and has a consistent flavor. All it lacks is the experience of years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Sister, do you know the name of this mountain?&quot; I shook my head. &quot;This is Aileng Mountain, named after Pa Aileng!&quot; said my cousin proudly. Pa Aileng was an outstanding leader of the Blang tribe more than 1,800 years ago. Legend has it that in order to find an ideal place to live, he led the Blang tribe across mountains and rivers. After going through untold hardships, they finally found a place full of wild tea trees. , the soil here is fertile, the streams are gurgling, the vegetation is lush and lush, birds and animals roam here, and it is surrounded by mountains. It is an ideal place to build a village. So Pa Aileng led the tribe to settle here, and guided the tribe to domesticate tea trees and open tea gardens. This is the origin of Brown Village and tea gardens in Mangjing Manghong area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The water and soil in Lengshan are the best, and the tea in Lengshan is also the best tea!” My cousin said to me with an unquestionable and firm attitude. The Blang people believe that their leader Pa Aileng has found the best home and the most fertile land for them. They also believe in the principle of harmonious coexistence between man and nature. Therefore, except for necessary care, the Blang people never use artificial fertilization when growing tea. Needless to say the use of chemicals. The tea trees in the mountains suck the mist and dew, extract nutrients from the soil and dead leaves of weeds, and convert them into tea substances little by little, forming the characteristics of Jingmai Mountain tea, which is bitter and astringent, sweet and refreshing, and orange-yellow in color. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this time, my cousin suddenly turned around and faced me, and said seriously: &quot;Sister, I always think that my ancestors left me such a precious tea land, I must protect it, no matter what The quality of tea trees and tea leaves must not be destroyed in my hands.&quot; I understood what my cousin meant. His main job is as a rural doctor, but he spends almost all his spare time on tea. The Brown people are originally a very clean people. When my cousin came here, he also brought in the professional habits of doctors. When his family picks and roasts tea, he insists on &quot;three things not falling to the ground&quot;, that is, picking the tea does not fall to the ground, withering the tea does not fall to the ground, and frying the tea does not fall to the ground. As for the final pressing of the tea cakes, he does it himself without any help. &quot;I will definitely continue to make tea well, and Pa Aileng will bless us.&quot; The cousin cast his eyes to the sky in the distance. There, the sun that was about to set was covered by a cloud, and the light came out from behind the cloud, giving the clouds a bright golden edge, like some kind of hint and approval from nature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[名字最有梗的小城，凭什么又翻红了？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257896]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-29 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[墨西哥公布“外星人”遗骸，网友：长得太符合刻板印象]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257926]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-29 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On September 12, local time, the Mexican Congress held its first public hearing related to &quot;unknown anomalies.&quot; At the meeting, shortly after two scientists played several videos showing &quot;UFOs and unknown anomalies&quot;, they displayed the remains of two suspected &quot;alien creatures&quot;, and related topics quickly became a &quot;hot search&quot;. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/30ce9c40e8e1e64679e83b2f04cf4218.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;427&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/30ce9c40e8e1e64679e83b2f04cf4218.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252807&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 13, 2023 local time, in Mexico City, the capital of Mexico, the remains of suspected &quot;alien creatures&quot; were displayed at a hearing.

Liu Yong believes that &quot;searching for extraterrestrial civilization&quot; has gone beyond a simple scientific issue and has become a philosophical issue. Exploring the mysteries of the universe and the origin of life may also be exploring people themselves and their meaning in the world and in the universe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, human beings are constantly accelerating their exploration of the universe. From the two &quot;Voyager&quot; detectors launched in 1977 to the &quot;China Sky Eye&quot; built in Guizhou, various detection methods have become more complete. Taking the &quot;China Sky Eye&quot; as an example, its experimental goals include receiving signals from extraterrestrial civilizations, pulsars, rapid electrical storms and other signals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in Liu Yong’s view, humans are still a long way from finding extraterrestrial civilizations. “Perhaps it will only be possible on a time scale of thousands or ten thousand years.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[音乐家李海鹰：月光流淌在珠江上]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257914]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-29 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;video id=&quot;contents-video-0&quot; data-fileid=&quot;5576678021849850177&quot; data-media=&quot; video&quot; data-resource=&quot;tencent&quot; data-filename=&quot;People Weekly Li Haiying&#39;s manuscript video.mp4&quot; data-cover=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/G8hfqzJQv3VepINkT0VCcndx1kDzyd2fW3QrQgrz .jpg&quot; data-url=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/02f2b5c2vodcq1251434507/e6988e555576678021849850177/HVmbvbHXk6EA.mp4&quot; poster=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot;>; &lt;source src=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/02f2b5c2vodcq1251434507/e6988e555576678021849850177/HVmbvbHXk6EA.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;>;&lt;/video>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of August 2023, in the Pearl River On Shazhou Ersha Island, Li Haiying is rehearsing the symphony &quot;China 1921&quot; composed by him. This composer has turned to the creation of large-scale musical works in recent years. In addition to the symphony he is rehearsing, he is also working on the music for a major TV series. When we walked into the rehearsal hall of the Guangzhou Symphony Orchestra, it was like stepping into a flowing stream just as the orchestra was playing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;When you walked in, you happened to reach the section about Guangzhou.&quot; Li Haiying said that a dozen meters away from the rehearsal hall is the Pearl River flowing eastward. The river flows further down, where he grew up when he was a child. place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As someone who grew up by the Pearl River, Li Haiying’s music has a strong sense of flow. Thirty years ago, he wrote &quot;Curved Moon&quot; and asked Liu Huan, who had a &quot;very floating voice&quot;, to sing it. He felt that the song had &quot;the feeling of being drenched by rain&quot;, even though the &quot;root-seeking craze&quot; was leading the culture at that time. world, &quot;Xintianyou&quot;, &quot;Nothing&quot;, etc. are blowing the northwest wind and sand throughout the mainland music scene. He also composed the music for &quot;Song of Seven Sons&quot;. In the song about Macau, he used the melody to simulate the crashing of the waves on the rocky shore. This song followed China&#39;s first lunar exploration satellite &quot;Chang&#39;e 1&quot; to space. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Although I live in Beijing, many of my creative commissions are from Guangzhou.&quot; 69-year-old Li Haiying said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/eomOXOcVnf0VzkC2W51Rkyk8QpJWDriwbjOltSud.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/eomOXOcVnf0VzkC2W51Rkyk8QpJWDriwbjOltSud.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252762&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Li Haiying&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Li Lewei/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1970, 16-year-old Li Haiying Entered the Guangzhou Cantonese Opera Troupe and became a violinist and composer. Five years later, he became a violinist and creator of the Art Troupe of the Political Department of the Chinese Navy&#39;s South China Sea Fleet. From the end of 1982 to March 1997, he worked as a composer in the Guangdong Music and Art Troupe and wrote works such as &quot;The Crooked Moon&quot;, &quot;Song of the Seven Sons&quot; and &quot;I Don&#39;t Want to Say&quot;. He is good at integrating folk song elements into the melodies of popular music, so his works have a vivid sense of place, such as &quot;The Crooked Moon&quot; with Cantonese tune, &quot;Crossing the River&quot; with Northeastern duo style, and &quot;Crossing the River&quot; with Shandong music characteristics. Traveling everywhere”. He has also written a lot of pop music, such as Eason Chan&#39;s &quot;Where to Start&quot; and Sun Li&#39;s &quot;Love is Like Air&quot;, and has also scored for film and television works such as &quot;Bright Sword&quot; and &quot;The Devil Is Coming&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The symphony has always been his dream. At the age of 49, Li Haiying began to study conducting under conductor and music educator Professor Xu Xin. At the age of 54, he re-learned composition lessons in the classroom of the Central Conservatory of Music. In his fifties, he re-learned and practiced conducting and composing music, and he sat in the classroom with undergraduate students. &quot;Actually, they are all very basic courses, just undergraduate courses.&quot; He is happy to learn and to be a newcomer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2012, Li Haiying became a newcomer to the symphony orchestra. He wrote and conducted the large-scale symphony work &quot;Our Sun Yat-sen&quot;, plus later &quot;Ode to the Sixth Ancestor&quot;, &quot;Symphony No. 1 (Pearl River)&quot; and &quot; China 1921&quot;, he composed a total of four symphonic works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The grand historical themes are very concretely presented in Li Haiying&#39;s music. He uses different musical styles to correspond to different cities. He uses Peking Opera to depict Beijing, Dragon Boat Tune to depict Wuchang, and Changsha to use Flower Drum Opera. ...His music has always maintained a local feel, which may come from his familiarity with folk songs and his research into related content during creation. In the children&#39;s musical &quot;Cat God in the Forbidden City&quot;, Li Haiying did a lot of research in order to fully grasp the atmosphere of Beijing, hoping to use music to depict the history and modern vitality of a city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/yGLXcpFrWdn0r6AKhKQ47kltM4JIkXqYfqNHV6Va.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/yGLXcpFrWdn0r6AKhKQ47kltM4JIkXqYfqNHV6Va.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252764&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In May 2023, Li Haiying and the Guangzhou Symphony Orchestra performed &quot;China 1921&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Li Lewei/Photo)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following is Li Haiying’s dictation:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Symphony and Pop: A Living Sense of Place&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;Before this show, I actually had a day or two of anxiety. &quot;China 1921&quot; is premiering in 2021. It has been performed for the seventh time this year alone. Is there anything else I can do? Can I make the orchestra perform better this time? If I want to do an operation that is not innovative, then I simply don’t do it, so during this rehearsal I was still changing the music and deleting bars. Of course, these were things I thought up at home, not a sudden inspiration on the spot. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;During the rehearsal, I had two roles, one was the composer and the other was the conductor. , equal to the player. When playing with an orchestra, I think about the music from another perspective and re-interpret the work. Moreover, you need to have an ability to make symphonies, and you need to have a strong memory. Just like playing blind chess, you have to remember the entire chessboard. This is also an ability that is constantly cultivated by making music. Basically, you have to memorize the music, and you also have to think about how to play it. Should it be more lively or soft? When I was a conductor, I had to modify some expression methods, and I also had to listen to the performance and make changes while performing, and I made a lot of adjustments. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When the Guangzhou Symphony Orchestra commissioned this work from me in 2019, I didn’t expect that I would write such a long piece. For the work, Director Yu Long told me at the time that the first thing to do was to write a beautiful melody, and secondly to focus on the year 1921. I collected information based on this idea and found that from August 1920 to the spring of 1921, early organizations of the Communist Party of China were established in six cities: Shanghai, Beijing, Wuhan, Changsha, Guangzhou, and Jinan. At the same time, among the Chinese in Japan and France, early organizations of the Communist Party of China, composed of advanced elements among overseas students, were also established. Therefore, my earliest design was 9 movements, using 9 musical styles, describing the October Revolution and what happened in Beijing, Wuhan, Changsha, Jinan, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Japan, and France from 1920 to 1921 on the eve of the founding of the Communist Party of China. fragments of history. It was shortened to 5 parts according to the structure of the music, but it still consists of 9 paragraphs. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The first movement is a passionate Allegro, which describes the outbreak of the October Revolution and is called &quot;The Shock of the Earth&quot; . The second movement begins with a quiet Andante, including two sections: &quot;Beiping Flying Catkins&quot; and &quot;Wuchang Autumn Waters&quot;. The third movement is the waltz, &quot;Eastern Alley&quot; and &quot;Morning Light in Paris&quot;. The fourth movement is Chinese dance music, mainly about Changsha, Jinan and Guangzhou. The last movement came with the convening of the &quot;First Class&quot;. When I arrived in Beijing, I used Peking Opera. In Wuhan, I adapted Dragon Boat Opera. In Changsha, I used Huagu Opera. In the Jinan part, I created a Shandong tune. In the Guangzhou part, I can also hear many elements of Cantonese music. At the end, I used a method often used in symphonies - fugue, stacking different themes together, which symbolized the rolling torrents coming together to form a huge force rushing towards the end. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;This is my fourth large-scale musical work. I am currently cooperating with the China Children&#39;s Art Theater The musical is called &quot;The Cat God in the Forbidden City&quot;. The previous owner of the Forbidden City is no longer there, and now the cat in the Forbidden City, &quot;Dorgon (the cat&#39;s name)&quot; is very popular on the Internet. I am full of expectations for this subject and am working hard to create it. The Forbidden City is a gathering place for Chinese culture. We want to promote Chinese culture, so we created a &quot;cat god&quot; of the Forbidden City. I hope that the writing will be more trendy, with many modern elements, but also contain Beijing culture, such as Beijing nursery rhymes, Beijing Qinshu, Pingju opera, etc. I think this is very important. What kind of works can be recognized by the public? First of all, it must have roots and learn from the best cultures around the world. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Creation still requires continuous learning. I feel that I am in the sprint period now, but I am also inert. I told those students that everyone goes down the path of inertia.

At least for my musical collaborators, everyone’s expectation is that I will continue to improve. If one day I find that Li Haiying has stopped, the cooperation will basically be over.

In the 1980s, I went into the pop music industry. After rolling a few times, I also made film and television soundtracks, such as &quot;Bright Sword&quot;, &quot;Foreign Girl&quot;, &quot;Happiness Like Flowers&quot;, etc., and I also participated in &quot;The Devil Is Coming&quot;. In the end, I felt that I had to go back to my childhood dream and realize it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When I was a child, I once played Saint-Saëns&#39;s &quot;Introduction and Rondo Caprice&quot; at home. It was the first time I was moved by symphony. My father used to be the deputy director of Guangzhou Huangpu Shipyard. Many engineers in the factory studied in the Soviet Union, and many of them like music. So my family had a record player in the 1950s. It played &quot;The Blue Danube&quot; and also played a lot of Cantonese music and Cantonese opera. My musical initiation was this record player and another Baltic radio. When I was about 14 years old, I forced my mother to buy me a Qinqin. As soon as I got the Qinqin home, I immediately played all the Cantonese music I had ever heard. Later, the radio was playing the music of the Red Detachment of Women, and I picked up the violin and played along. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When I was 16 years old, the Guangzhou Cantonese Opera Troupe came to our school to recruit students, and I was selected because I was the only student in the school who could play music notation and a little violin. Later, I entered the composition training class of Guangzhou Xinghai Conservatory of Music for a year and a half. By the 1980s, some record companies came to me to do composing, which was equivalent to an invitation to write music, and I started to become a freelance musician from then on. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The first time I wrote lyrics was for &quot;The Curved Moon&quot;, and I had a few notes first , then I wrote the music and lyrics overlapping each other, and I finished it in half an hour. At that time, what was popular in the music world was the high-pitched and hard-hitting &quot;Northwest Wind&quot;. &quot;Curved Moon&quot; was a typical Cantonese tune. I said it had the &quot;feeling of being drenched by rain.&quot; It was many years later that I realized that this song recorded the life of the Dan family who lived on boats on the Pearl River. It was not only the description of the words themselves, but also the rhythm of the song was the rhythm of the Dan family&#39;s oars. This inspiration comes from the fact that I lived by the Pearl River when I was a child. I crossed the river in a boat rowed by the Dan family. The Dan family even carried a baby on their backs and rowed the boat. The boat could seat four people. I was sitting on the boat and heard them calling Gillian. Gillian is the most common name for girls from the Dan family. It’s just that the Dan family can no longer be seen on the Pearl River. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When I wrote this song, there was no commission from a music company, and I was not sure what I wanted to do. The singer comes to sing. The first person I found was Chen Rujia. After Chen Rujia came to record, I felt it was inappropriate as soon as I heard it, so I called Liu Huan and asked him if he was in Beijing and asked him to record the song tomorrow. Liu Huan didn&#39;t even listen to the song, so she agreed on the phone. I went to Beijing the next day, and he came to record in the afternoon. At that time, the commercial market based on stars had not yet formed, so the interaction with singers was that simple. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Guangdong in the 1980s and 1990s was also a golden age to some extent, because everything was It&#39;s new and changing with each passing day. Maybe everyone is nostalgic and feels that the past era was the golden age. In fact, the entire economic foundation was not at a very high level at that time, but the momentum and passion shown by people on the wave was quite rare. This wave played a great role in promoting Guangzhou. At that time, Guangzhou was not only in the music, but also in the media, such as TV stations, radio stations, newspapers, advertising, and film and television dramas. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/STJftJIqxtidMsGROGhEagOpstYMzv7sJHSJEd9e.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 500&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/STJftJIqxtidMsGROGhEagOpstYMzv7sJHSJEd9e.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252761&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Liu Huan&#39;s &quot;The Curved Moon&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style= &quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Curved Moon&quot; was composed in the late 1980s, when the northwest wind was blowing fiercely in the music industry, so when everyone heard it, they felt that this song Why is it so special, so southern, so soft. Of course, most people accepted it quickly. Only a few people in the industry felt it was inappropriate and that it was different from the trend of the entire era. At that time, it was all about &quot;My Hometown Is Not Beautiful&quot; and the like. Behind this trend all point to the &quot;root-seeking craze&quot; in the 1980s, such as the oil painting &quot;Father&quot; and the movie &quot;Red Sorghum&quot;.

I didn&#39;t leave after arriving in Beijing that time, and began to devote more energy to film and television soundtracks. From &quot;Betrayal&quot;, &quot;Black Ice&quot; to &quot;Bright Sword&quot;, some people asked, why did you write the soundtracks for all the dramas?

If you haven&#39;t had a popular song for a few years, people will think that your songs can&#39;t be released. Until the song &quot;Love is Like Air&quot;, I wrote the melody alone for a month and a half.

In 2008, a group of undergraduate students and I went to the Central Conservatory of Music to take classes. Once the head of the composition department of the Central Conservatory of Music stopped me and said, Li Haiying, what are you doing here? I said go to class.

Times are turbulent, and I often do other things before the tide recedes. For example, I was doing film and television soundtracks, and later I was doing classical music. I didn’t wait until the wave ended and left me desperate, so I left long ago. I am a newbie in classical music calculation, and it was only in 2016 that I started writing large-scale works. As long as I maintain this state of learning, humility, and devotion, including now writing musicals and operas, I also hope to be innovative. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Music is written directly for people, it is a dialogue. Another point is that I do not advocate my own ideas. I will write your thoughts and feelings.

This concept may make me seem very personalityless on the surface, but the more I go on, the more I feel that my music is not about me.

At the top of the mountain, there is a flat area. On the flat side, I saw that long-known plant. It is not eye-catching, slightly similar to the common broom grass in Sichuan, but shorter; it is also a bit like orchid grass, but with thinner leaves. It has not yet reached the flowering period, and there is no purple-red color like the clouds in the picture. If you look closely, it does look like a toothbrush. No wonder it is called toothbrush grass among the people. In fact, its scientific name is Haizhou Xiangnuo, and its other name is more widely known: Copper Grass Flower. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to imagine how excited the ancestors who were looking for it were when they saw the coppergrass flowers all over the mountains and plains on this gentle hillside three thousand years ago. They were even ecstatic with excitement. Because the copper grass flower is a symbol of an important metal - wherever it grows, deep in the earth, there must be copper mines...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/22/10/28/5ofLItqyHH0Tl7WRalCsMJW6VkUfNdzcaSj4GY5C.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1707&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias /image/22/10/28/5ofLItqyHH0Tl7WRalCsMJW6VkUfNdzcaSj4GY5C.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;213168&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tonglushan ancient copper mine site is located in Three kilometers west of Daye City, Hubei Province. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC Photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Gifts&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The banquet was over, and King Chu Cheng gave it to those who came to see him Zheng Wengong gave a generous gift. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This generous gift is estimated to be worth about 20,000 to 30,000 yuan based on today&#39;s market price. However, in the distant Spring and Autumn Period, its value could not be measured in terms of money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is copper. When Zheng Wengong returned to Zheng State with a thousand kilograms of copper, King Chu Cheng regretted it more and more. He sent an envoy to catch up with Zheng Wengong - he must have wanted to take back the copper, but doing so would not only offend Zheng State, but also make people in the world joke. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;King Chu Cheng’s regret had very clear practical considerations. In the pre-Qin period, the ancients classified the major affairs of the country into two things, namely &quot;the major affairs of the country are sacrifice and military affairs&quot; as stated in &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot;. Although the original meaning of &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot; refers to sacrificial rituals and military rituals, later generations further extended it and believed that the most important things in the country were sacrifices and wars. Both sacrifices and wars are inseparable from copper - sacrifices require a large number of bronze vessels to be cast; as for wars, copper is a necessity for making weapons. Compared with the stone, bone and wooden weapons of the Stone Age, copper weapons are invincible and have unparalleled superiority. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bronze originated in the Longshan Culture period. The Xia Dynasty began to enter the Bronze Age, while the Shang Dynasty and Zhou Dynasty reached the peak of bronze civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called bronze is an alloy of copper and tin or lead. It was called gold and lucky gold in ancient China. Among the chemical elements that make up bronze, the most important is copper, which accounts for more than 80%. Without copper, there would be no bronze; without bronze, there would be no bronze civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For King Chu Cheng, his regret was not about the thousand catties of copper. Copper, he had plenty of it. He was worried that Zheng Guo would take the copper back to make weapons. Therefore, he asked Zheng Wengong to promise that the copper donated by the Chu State could only be used for ritual vessels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tracing back to the origins of Chu State, it was once so humble that it could be ignored. In terms of level, among male princes, Bozi belongs to the fourth level: Zi. Regarding the initial land enfeoffment, it was only fifty miles away. There is a story that illustrates the weakness of the Chu people when they founded the country: After Xiong Yi was named the son of Chu, he built a temple. After the temple was completed and the first sacrifice was about to be held, it was discovered that they were so poor that they didn&#39;t even have a sacrificial cow. This &quot;country&quot; is so big, but it can&#39;t even produce a single cow, which shows how small and shabby this &quot;country&quot; is. Out of poverty, Xiong Yi took people to the neighboring country of Bo to steal a calf. After the calf was stolen back, Xiong Yi was afraid that the owner would come to visit him, so he had to kill the calf overnight to sacrifice it - and the rules at that time were that sacrifices were held during the day. Since then, the Chu people have formed a unique custom: all sacrifices are held at night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just like a trickle of water can gather into a mighty river, as long as enough time is given, a miracle may be born. For the Chu State, if it was like an unobtrusive flame in the wind when it was founded, then, after hundreds of years of continuous development, by the time of Xiong Tong, the son of Chu in the early Spring and Autumn Period, the Chu State had risen. Become an important presence among the princes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 704 BC, which was the thirty-seventh year of Xiong Tong&#39;s reign, he sent his followers to ask the Emperor of Zhou to promote him to a noble title. However, Emperor Zhou flatly refused. Xiong Tong was furious and proclaimed himself king, calling him King Wu of Chu. Although the Emperor of Zhou has lost his former authority since King Ping of Zhou moved eastward, the princes who dared to brag against the disapproval of the world and claim the title of king began with Xiong Tong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiong Tong dared to fight against the Emperor Zhou. On the one hand, due to the hard work of more than ten generations, the Chu State was no longer the small country with a lot of obstacles; on the other hand, after many years of hard work, the Chu people gradually controlled One of the most important strategic materials has the material basis to challenge Emperor Zhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That is copper, copper from the Coppergreen Mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/28/HnrOGxJiZOSdrgXR10zG7Zpr8MN4jXcLRwGTIToa.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/28/HnrOGxJiZOSdrgXR10zG7Zpr8MN4jXcLRwGTIToa.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;213165&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Azurite mine in Tonglu Mountain&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC Photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the northeast To the southwest, after crossing the Yangtze River via the Qijia Expressway, it enters Huangshi City, Hubei Province. To the north of the highway, there is a lake of tens of square kilometers, which is Daye Lake connected to the Yangtze River. The westernmost end of Daye Lake is Daye under the jurisdiction of Huangshi. Heading west out of Daye, the road twists and turns, passing through undulating low mountainous areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tonglu Mountain is hidden deep in this low mountainous area. The &quot;Daye County Chronicle&quot; published by Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty explained the origin of the name Tonglu Mountain: &quot;The top of the mountain is high and flat, with huge rocks facing each other. Every time it rains, there are bronze greens like snowflakes and adzuki beans dotted on the earth and rocks. Hence the name. It stretches for several years. Zhang, the soil color is purple and red, and they are all Guanshan. It may be the place where copper was produced in ancient times.&quot; This green snowflake adzuki bean is actually malachite, which is a copper-containing carbonate mineral that is often associated with copper. The large amount of malachite washed out of the surface after a shower shows that the copper mine in Tonglushan is shallowly buried and of high grade, making it a rare rich mine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As far as China is concerned, copper resources are widely distributed and relatively concentrated. In general, the main copper mines are in the south. There is a rich copper ore belt in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River - from Tonglu Mountain to Ruichang, more than 100 kilometers away, and to Tongling, more than 300 kilometers away, there are dots of large copper mines, with reserves accounting for one-third of the country. Two or more. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rise of Chu State was also invincible due to the blessing of Tonglu Mountain. As the first metal mastered by human beings, a steady stream of high-grade copper ore is put into burning furnaces to smelt out massive amounts of copper, which is then combined with tin or lead to be upgraded to bronze - ritual vessels cast in bronze, lingering in the smoke. The temples made of bronze became a bridge between the Chu people and their ancestors and gods; the agricultural tools made of bronze allowed the vast land in the south to be reclaimed, and more food was enough to feed a larger population; the weapons made of bronze accompanied the Chu people who were brave and good at fighting. Charge into battle, expand territory...&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Conquest&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Starting from Tonglu Mountain, a three-hour drive, nearly 300 kilometers away to the northwest is Suizhou City, Hubei Province. In Suizhou, the sensational tomb of Zeng Houyi was discovered. The most important cultural relic unearthed from the tomb of Zeng Houyi is now stored in the Hubei Provincial Museum, which is the bronze chime that can still play beautiful music. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Hou is the king of Zeng State; and Zeng State is another name for Sui State, which was enfeoffed by Zhou Dynasty. Thousands of cultural relics were unearthed from the tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng, among which the total weight of bronze products exceeds ten tons - the bronze chime alone weighs four tons. So much copper, where does it come from? In the past few years, professionals used chemical and spectral analysis on Zeng Houyi&#39;s chime bell, and compared it with the copper mine data unearthed from the Tonglushan archeology, and concluded that the copper material of Zenghou Yi&#39;s chime bell came from Tonglushan. ——Using the same method, it was also proved that the raw materials of the bronzes unearthed from Fuhao&#39;s tomb in Yinxu, Anyang, also came from Tonglu Mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/28/BUDkuuqJntNhn6I4gZ4OhMcUTYdeKFDanhoC1Wnb.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/28/BUDkuuqJntNhn6I4gZ4OhMcUTYdeKFDanhoC1Wnb.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;213167&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zeng Houyi Bronze Chime Bell&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These conclusions are actually Within reason. Not only did the large amount of copper material in the tomb of Zeng Hou Yi come from the Tonglu Mountain, but even when the Emperor of Zhou was enfeoffed to follow the country, a very important reason was for copper. During the Shang and Zhou dynasties, there was a busy and important copper-tin road in the hinterland of China. That is what the bronze inscriptions call &quot;the path of gold and tin&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the National Museum of China, there is a bronze vessel named Zeng Boyun. The 簠 is a utensil used to serve rice during sacrifices or banquets. It is also called the 簋, the square one is called 簠 and the round one is called 簋. Zeng Boyun was used by the king of Zeng (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Sui&lt;/span>;). The inscription on it contains the following sentences: &quot;...Kedi Huaiyi, suppress the Xiefan Tang, move the golden road and tin, and use all the tools to prepare the way.&quot; It means: (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Zeng Bo&lt;/span>;) punish the Huaiyi , the transportation hub Fantang and the copper and tin channels have been stabilized and have returned to normal. This is the origin of Jindaoxixing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Shang Dynasty moved its capital many times, but generally speaking, they were all in today&#39;s Central Plains region; the Western Zhou Dynasty made its capital Haojing, now Xi&#39;an; the Eastern Zhou Dynasty moved its capital to Luoyi, now Luoyang. During the heyday of the Bronze Age, the demand for copper and supporting tin for thousands of years during the Shang and Zhou dynasties was undoubtedly astronomical. In the vast north or the Yellow River Basin, only Zhongtiao Mountain and other places had copper mines, but the output was small. . The copper and tin needed by the Shang and Zhou Dynasties could only be transported thousands of miles from the south. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The general route of the Jindao Tin Line, which mainly transports copper and tin, is as follows: Hunan&#39;s tin and Tonglu Mountains and northern Jiangxi&#39;s copper, after being collected in the present-day Wuhan area, arrive in Suizhou via Xiaogan, along the Suizao Corridor. It entered the Nanyang Basin, then passed through present-day Fangcheng and Ye County to Luoyang, or continued westward to Guanzhong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is an extremely difficult transportation line. Two or three thousand years ago, when roads and railways were scarce and there were only rugged trails, the ancients could only rely on animals and manpower in addition to ships. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Long transportation lines mean more risks and more uncertainties. Especially when the transported items are copper that determines the fate of the country, the risks increase sharply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to ensure the smooth transportation of copper and tin from Tonglu Mountain and other places to the capital, Emperor Zhou enfeoffed more than a dozen small countries in important areas north of the Han River and south of the upper reaches of the Huai River. Most of these small countries have the surname Ji, or are related to the surname Ji, so they are called the Ji of Hanyang. The concubines of Hanyang had two tasks. One was to guard against Huaiyi in the south; the other was to ensure the smooth flow of the copper and tin road. After the decline of Huaiyi and the rise of Chu, the first task of Zhu Ji changed from guarding against Huaiyi to guarding against Chu. However, things are unpredictable. Not only did the concubines of Hanyang fail to curb Chu&#39;s northward and eastward advance, but even the copper-tin road they guaranteed and even the Tonglu Mountain that produced copper mines fell into the hands of the Chu people. In the end, &quot;Hanyang&quot; All concubines, the state of Chu is complete.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The countries established by the concubines of Hanyang are dotted in the intersection of north and south China, including Tang, Cai, Ying, Xi, Shen, Sui, etc. Among the concubines, Sui Guo is the most powerful and is the leader of them all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nanyang Basin and Jianghan Plain are separated by a series of low and gentle mountains. Among them, there is a long and narrow plain between Dahong Mountain and Tongbai Mountain, both running northwest to southeast, which becomes the link between Nanyang Basin and Jianghan Plain. traffic channels between. This tunnel is bounded by Suizhou in the south and Zaoyang in the north, so it is called the Suizao Corridor. As the eldest among the concubines in Hanyang, Sui Guo follows the gateway of the Zao Corridor and connects to the Yangtze River through the Jianshui River. Copper from Tonglu Mountain and more distant places such as Ruichang and Tongling can be traced up the river, passing through the Sui Zao Corridor and then north. Transport to the Central Plains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/27/0db5OdAetgUKAOX0yDkVnWKje30RWBDgAHTMIkrd.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;1331&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/27/0db5OdAetgUKAOX0yDkVnWKje30RWBDgAHTMIkrd.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;213064&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The war between the Chu State and the Chu State for the Tonglu Mountain was The era of King Wu kicked off; the main target of the war was Sui Guo - before this, King Wu of Chu annexed Quan State and established counties in Quan State&#39;s territory, which was the beginning of China&#39;s county system. At this time, the power of the Chu State penetrated deep into the Jianghan Plain, and the fertile Jianghan Plain was being eroded bit by bit by the Chu people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Facing the set goal, King Chu Wu showed great patience - he has been waiting, looking for opportunities while waiting - King Chu Wu waited from his middle age until his twilight years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 706 BC, Sui suffered from a drought, resulting in a massive reduction in grain production and a lack of food for the soldiers and civilians. King Wu of Chu took the opportunity to attack Sui. The Chu army came to the city, and the princes knew that they were no match, so they had to send people to King Wu of Chu to ask for peace. King Wu of Chu accepted the peace talks, and one of the conditions was that he would ask the Emperor of Zhou to be promoted to the title of Chu Kingdom. The first expedition against Sui and the establishment of an alliance under the city with the country meant that the Chu people had already gotten involved in the road of copper and tin, and from then on they could obtain a steady stream of high-quality copper. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two years later, Sui, who had an alliance with Chu, refused to attend the alliance led by Chu. King Chu Wu used this as an excuse to attack Sui for the second time. This time, the Chu army was defeated and the Sui army fled. Even the chariot was captured by the Chu army. Also in this year, Suihou informed King Wu of Chu that the Emperor of Zhou refused to promote him to the title. Therefore, King Wu of Chu became angry and proclaimed himself king. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the next three years, Chu State defeated a series of countries including Yun State, Jiu State, Zhou State, Deng State and Liao State. These countries either became vassals of Chu State or had to fight with Chu State. Make an alliance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in 699 BC, when attacking Luo State, Chu State general Qu Xia was conceited and underestimated the enemy. He was defeated by the coalition forces of Luo State and Lu State. Qu Xia committed suicide. ——Since then, the Chu State has formed an unwritten rule: any commander who leads troops to fight must commit suicide to apologize once he is defeated. This determination, soaked in the bones and blood of Chu people, was passed down to the last commander-in-chief, Xiang Yu, the overlord of Western Chu who would rather commit suicide than return to Jiangdong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;King Wu of Chu had to slow down his campaign. For the next eight years, King Wu of Chu did not raise any more troops to attack his followers. He concentrated his efforts and swept away Luo, Lu, Yan, Zhou and Liao, and firmly controlled the Jianghan Plain. It should be during this period that the Tonglu Mountain also belonged to the Chu State. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When everything came to pass, King Wu of Chu attacked him for the third time. Because Suiguo is not only an important stronghold on the copper-tin road, but also a springboard for Chu to fight for hegemony northward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the eve of the expedition, he felt heart discomfort during the sacrifice and knew that his days were numbered. Sure enough, when the Chu army crossed the Han River and King Wu of Chu was sitting under a sycamore tree by the roadside to rest, he could never stand up again - this king who advocated force and was determined to expand his territory died like this. On the journey. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the death of King Chu Wu, the Chu army continued to advance towards the capital of Sui without announcing the funeral. When Suihou saw the army approaching the border, he was frightened and sent people to sue for peace. From then on, Suiguo, who was originally loyal to the Emperor of Zhou and monitored the south for the Emperor of Zhou and guarded the copper and tin road, became a vassal of Chu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the death of King Chu Wu, King Chu Wen came to the throne. The first thing King Wen of Chu did when he came to power was to move the capital from the remote Danyang to Ying. The Chu State had moved its capital many times. After the first move to Ying, the subsequent capitals were all called Ying or Yingdu. The place where King Wen of Chu moved to Ying is said to be Jingzhou or Yicheng. No matter who is right, the indisputable fact is that the power of Chu State has crossed the Han River from west to east. During the reign of King Chu Wen, he successively destroyed the State of Shen, Xi and Deng, repeatedly defeated the State of Cai, and made a northern expedition to the State of Zheng - this was also the beginning of the Chu State&#39;s quest to dominate the Central Plains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After King Chu Wen, King Chu Cheng went to a higher level and successively annexed more than ten small countries such as Er, Gu, Huang, Ying, Jiang, and Fang. The State of Zheng, which borders the State of Chu, was on the fence between Jin and Chu. This is how Zheng Wengong went to see King Chu Cheng, and King Chu Cheng gave him a thousand catties of copper. However, King Chu Cheng was born at the wrong time - he met Duke Huan of Qi, the most powerful of the Five Hegemons of the Spring and Autumn Period. In order to teach the Chu State a lesson, Qi Huangong led the coalition forces deep into the Chu territory. Although the two sides did not decide the winner, the Chu State had to admit its mistake to the coalition forces and recognize Qi State&#39;s dominance. By the time of King Chuzhuang, the grandson of King Chu Cheng, this soaring and blockbuster King of Chu defeated the northern superpower Jin, thus becoming one of the five hegemons of the Spring and Autumn Period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The history of the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period is a history of princes fighting against each other. In the merger of big fish eating small fish and small fish eating shrimps, small countries continued to disappear and big countries grew bigger like a snowball. Among the princes, the Chu State destroyed the most, with more than fifty people. At its peak, Chu State ranked first in territory, equivalent to the sum of other princes. It can be said that if it were not for the incompetence of several generations of Chu kings in the late Warring States Period, it would have been more likely to be the Chu State that wiped out the heroes, rather than the Qin State located in the northwest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind the Chu people’s illustrious military exploits, Tonglu Mountain was the silent and lasting first driving force, creating the miracles of the Bronze Age. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Ruins&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Tonglushan Ancient Copper Mine Ruins Museum is located on the hill where coppergrass flowers sway. There are few tourists, and the copper grass flowers are looking at themselves in the wind. On the other side of the hill, I saw a huge pit like a funnel embedded between the peaks. The pit sank hundreds of meters below the surface and was hundreds of meters in diameter. A road winding like a snake passed by a factory with thick smoke. Reaching into the pit, trucks crawled like beetles. This is the open-pit copper mine that is still being mined today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/28/9uJBUw2mJkQOkjCfGS5hm1oryhTPWo0UgpL6g2iZ.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1441&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/28/9uJBUw2mJkQOkjCfGS5hm1oryhTPWo0UgpL6g2iZ.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;213166&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tonglushan Open-pit Copper Mine&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC Photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1973, the It was while working in this open-pit mine that the miners of the Nonferrous Metallurgical Company dug out thirteen rusty copper axes from the ground. Later, using thirteen copper axes that had been dormant for thousands of years as clues, archaeologists followed the clues and unearthed seven open-pit mines, 18 underground mining areas, more than 50 ancient smelting sites and More than ten smelting shaft furnaces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reappearance of ancient copper mines under the earth not only reveals the secret of the rise of Chu State, but also proves that Chinese bronze culture is not foreign, but originated from the mainland. Archaeological evidence shows that the mining of Tonglushan copper mines began in the late Shang Dynasty, and continued through the Western Zhou Dynasty, the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period to the Han Dynasty, which lasted for thousands of years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the museum, large and small copper slags are displayed in glass cabinets - things that look either slightly yellow or slightly green. Archaeologists estimate that there are as many as 400,000 tons of copper slag in the entire Tonglushan site. Based on rough calculations based on copper slag, Tonglushan produces about 120,000 tons of copper. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The figure of 120,000 tons is a bit empty. If you convert it, you will know how huge it is: the Shang Dynasty Stepmother Wu Ding unearthed in Anyang (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The Simuwu Dafang Ding&lt;/span>;) is the heaviest bronze in China so far, weighing more than 800 kilograms. 120,000 tons can be used to cast 140,000 statues. Some people have made another calculation: the main equipment of soldiers in the Spring and Autumn Period was copper ge, each weighing about half a kilogram and 120,000 tons, enough to make 240 million pieces. Of course, not all of the 120,000 tons of copper from Tonglu Mountain is exclusively owned by the Chu State. However, in the mining history of more than a thousand years from the late Shang Dynasty to the Western Han Dynasty, Chu State accounted for about half of the mining time. This was the golden age of Tonglu Mountain. The Chu people obtained at least tens of thousands of tons of high-quality copper from the depths of Tonglu Mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When King Zhuang of Chu aspired to conquer the Central Plains, he proudly said to Wang Sunman, a minister of Emperor Zhou, &quot;The beak of Chu&#39;s broken hook is enough to make nine tripods.&quot; This means that as long as the sharp edges of Chu&#39;s weapons are taken off, it will be enough to be melted into Jiuding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The massive amount of copper in Tonglu Mountain proves that King Chuzhuang was not exaggerating at all. His Chu country, whether it is the civil governance of the alliance princes or the martial arts of conquering cities and territories; whether it is the stubborn and domineering character of the Chu people or the Chu music of Hong Zhongda Lu; whether it is the gloomy Chu Feng that respects ghosts or the soul-stirring Chu Ci—— They are all based on copper, with copper as their bones, and with copper as their foundation...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10 /28/TngRunAON2E2ufuol8qlegxPuW9w8r9SziHNBJWV.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/28/TngRunAON2E2ufuol8qlegxPuW9w8r9SziHNBJWV. jpeg &quot; data-key=&quot;213164&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Viewers look at the early Spring and Autumn shaft furnace model unearthed from Tonglu Mountain in the National Museum of China. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC Photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Tonglu Mountain, those long-standing mines go deep underground and extend in all directions like a maze. Some of the wood that was laid down two to three thousand years ago to support the tunnels has not yet rotted. Walking cautiously in the restored mine, the tunnel is narrow and damp. I can&#39;t help but think of the Chu miners who worked all day long with a torch in the belly of the earth in Tonglu Mountain more than 2,000 years ago. Whether they are swinging a heavy copper ax to hit the hard rock formation, or dragging a bamboo basket full of copper ore along the tunnel, the labor day after day and year after year makes them like worker bees dying. The power and glory of the Chu State, the hegemony of King Wu and King Wen, and the grand plans of King Cheng and Zhuang, they have contributed a lot, but history will not leave their names. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Main reference books: &quot;Historical Records&quot;, &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot;, &quot;Chu History&quot;, &quot;A Brief History of Chu State&quot;, &quot;Spring and Autumn History&quot; China&#39;s Pre-Qin Copper Mines&quot; &quot;Metallurgical Archeology&quot; &quot;Chinese Bronze&quot; &quot;Loess and Bronze&quot; &quot;Daye County Chronicles&quot;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[专访陈冲：我没有强大的自信，只有强大的欲望]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257475]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-29 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/ 09/22/wZhQcinkVpws8y7jI3ZKp7XYc6l6VWrqUGmQWVtU.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1439&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/09/22/wZhQcinkVpws8y7jI3ZKp7XYc 6l6VWrqUGmQWVtU. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;209385&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1981, Chen Chong studied film production in the United States and directed his first film in 1998 &quot;Heavenly Bath&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an actor, Chen Chong is well known, and as a director, Chen Chong is well known. few. Chen Chong is one of the three directors of the movie &quot;Her in the World&quot; to be released on September 9, 2022, the other two are Sylvia Chang and Li Shaohong. The film tells an emotional story under difficult circumstances, involving mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, couples and lovers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2020, Chen Chong received a call from producer Dong Wenjie, hoping to invite several well-known female directors to jointly shoot a movie. She finally decided to tell the story of a pair of lovers separated in two places, &quot;to explore the closest expression of the oldest theme of love.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like all previous works she directed, Chen Chong wrote the script herself. She repeatedly looked at the real photos taken by her colleagues. There was a supermarket scene in the movie, so she found many supermarket CCTVs and watched them, wanting to know details such as the denseness of the crowds. The script was originally written to rain, and the rendering of rain was used to increase the atmosphere, but later she learned that there was no rain in reality on the day set in the movie, so she removed this setting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Without the rain, wouldn&#39;t the story have happened? Wouldn&#39;t the feelings be conveyed? So, whether there is rain or not is not important, but whether there is the conveyance of emotions is important.&quot; She said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Her in the World&quot; was originally scheduled to be released on the May Day holiday in 2021, but was later postponed to the Mid-Autumn Festival in 2022. During the editing of the film, a Southern Weekend staff writer interviewed Chen Chong in Shanghai. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Love and loss are eternal&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot; >;The setting of this movie sounds a bit like Love in the Time of Cholera. When you were approaching this story, did you have a clear setting from the beginning? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After receiving the invitation from the producer, I searched online for a week and finally found this story about lovers who were exiled in two places. Touched me. The girl returned to Beijing to visit her parents during the Spring Festival, but she has not been able to see her boyfriend who was locked down in Wuhan since then. This melody of love, loss, and exile resonated with me—I too am unable to travel home to visit my elderly parents due to the pandemic. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For lovers who are blocked in two cities, the mobile phone screen is something that arouses their infinite desire and is warmer than real life. In fact, this is also the relationship between most people and their mobile phones. Especially during the epidemic, people’s interactions with others and their understanding of the world come from mobile phones. The contradictions and conflicts in human nature also come from people&#39;s different interpretations of online messages. We all seem to be living on isolated islands in our mobile phones. The more attractive &quot;reality&quot; on the screen seems more &quot;real&quot; than life itself. The themes of love and loss, life and death are ancient and timeless, and my challenge was to give it a new screen narrative for today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Have you ever considered adding a paragraph about their love history? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Absolutely no flashbacks. This story is that these two people are always in different frames, and it wants you to be deeply moved by them.

My husband and I often do this too. Video communication. These two people are in love. They video chat when they wake up in the morning, before going to bed at night, and while cooking and brushing teeth. They chat casually in separate places, but it makes people feel the joy and love of two people together. , this is my excitement point. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you think of the emotional tone expressed in this story? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This is a story about true love. If a person can love like this once, he is very lucky. Not everyone can love like this. Because he has had real happiness, and the sadness of loss is sublimated into the beauty in the black mirror. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Many people in the world are actually not satisfied with love in their hearts. So I believe it, but the desire and demand for love still seems very strong. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After we finished filming, several of the main creators climbed Xiangshan Mountain. After climbing to the top, they saw many people writing blessing signs. . I said let’s hang one too, and we wrote our blessings for the movie and hung it there. I looked through it carefully, and there were hundreds of tags, and there were countless love words in them. They were all &quot;So-and-so loves so-and-so&quot; and &quot;So-and-so will be with so-and-so forever.&quot; More than half of them, you can Did you say that love is gone? impossible. When you fall in love, can you stop yourself? Even this bit of vitality is gone, and your life has been in vain. This thing is different from desire. It is really a gift from God to you. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Princess Sissi is the Empress of Austria.

In fact, film is an apprenticeship, and film school comes later. When the movie first started, everyone was learning on the spot, apprentice-style. The kind of learning from a master should be more useful. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You directed the first film &quot;Tianba&quot; When you were young, you cut it yourself.

I&#39;ve seen it, but it&#39;s quite unbearable. I actually have a very sensitive radar. I can see the clues of my own dishonesty. Maybe others can’t see it, but I can definitely see it. So watching your own movies is not an easy task. Movies are not a tool for actors, but for directors, so you are a pawn in it, and if you see your own problems, it does not affect your feeling that the movie is pretty good. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The films you directed are all because of yourself Do you have the desire to create, or do you have to find funds or outside sources? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Both. If funds come to me and I don’t have the desire, I will definitely not go. Because being a director is quite hard for me and not an easy thing. I am not a genius director, nor am I a technical director. I have limited talent and limited skills. If I don’t have a strong narrative desire, then I simply can’t do this. So you must have a strong narrative desire to do it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The movies you direct are all written by yourself ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I must, because it is not difficult for me. Of course I hope to get opinions and tips from like-minded creators, as well as a lot of information that everyone has worked on together, because I think information is the best thing for me to write a script. But the script is actually the movie I see in my mind when I close my eyes. I write it down first, and it will definitely change after all the main creators come in. But the first thing you write down is the movie you see in your head, so it&#39;s not that difficult. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When was the first time you stood on the Oscar stage? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;&quot;The Last Emperor&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Did you feel a great sense of satisfaction at that moment? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;No, when I was young, I didn’t particularly care about work or these things.

I don’t know what is wasteful. It may be a bit wasteful to keep doing things you don’t want to do. For example, if you are in love, if you do something you want to do, but that thing is ridiculous or wrong, or it brings you a lot of losses, I think it still cannot be considered a waste. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Have you ever been on stage? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I don’t dare. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Because I am afraid of crowds, I am especially afraid of crowds. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;It is true that Chinese domestic movies rarely look older Do you have a female character with a solid concept? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Very few, too few, especially in the current film culture, which advocates youth, and the requirements and standards for women are still...

My mother stopped me from reading at that time because she thought it was not good and it was better to do some homework, do housework, and go out to play. My mother is a medical scientist. After retirement, she only reads novels. She likes to read novels.

I couldn&#39;t look it up in the dictionary and explain it to you with just one click. I was very confused. Tired and very slow. I was shocked. Is this what the book says?

Without the magic of the movie itself, putting this scene in a live-action show would be like chewing wax no matter how you play it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[20岁的她会是中国女子网球的希望吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257924]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-29 15:00:01&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/29/J49b237SL4yZBk0wxflFj4doMIOdarYuYzsro5qS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/J49b237SL4yZBk0wxflFj4doMIOdarYuY zsro5qS. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252800&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 29, 2023, in the women’s singles tennis final of the Hangzhou Asian Games, Zheng Qinwen won 2 Defeated Zhu Lin 0-0 and won the championship &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The women&#39;s tennis at the Asian Games that ended on September 29, 2023 In the singles final, Chinese player Zheng Qinwen defeated teammate Zhu Lin in straight sets 6:2, 6:4 and won the gold medal in the women&#39;s singles tennis event at the Hangzhou Asian Games. This is the first time that 20-year-old Zheng Qinwen has participated in the Asian Games. With Zheng Qinwen and Zhu Lin winning both the championship and runner-up, the Chinese women&#39;s tennis team achieved its fifth consecutive Asian Games title. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2022, Zheng Qinwen reached the top 16 at the French Open, setting a new age for a Chinese female tennis player to reach the top 16 in a Grand Slam event, and attracted the attention of the world&#39;s tennis community. In the first half of 2023, her state had some ups and downs, but she recovered at the US Open and reached the top 8, once again setting a personal best. Zheng Qinwen, who only turned 21 in October this year, has just begun his career. The excellent results have given fans high expectations for this Hubei girl: After Li Na, the representative Chinese female tennis player, retires, will she, who is also from Hubei, be the next hope for Chinese women&#39;s tennis? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/WBGP66uN3qIInLbWR6KFYC7U06hMeuAE5yJwTZRZ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/WBGP66uN3qIInLbWR6KFYC7U06hMeuAE5yJwTZRZ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252801&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 29, 2023, Zheng Qinwen returned the ball in the women&#39;s singles tennis final of the Hangzhou Asian Games&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Rocket Girl&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In September 2014, tennis player Li Na officially retired. In her 15-year career, she reached the WTA women&#39;s singles finals 21 times and won a total of 9 WTA and 19 ITF singles championships, including the 2011 French Open and the 2014 Australian Open women&#39;s singles championships. She is Asia&#39;s first Grand Slam women&#39;s singles champion. She was once ranked second in the world&#39;s women&#39;s tennis singles rankings, with a total career record of 503 wins and 188 losses. When she retired, she was ranked sixth in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Na&#39;s retirement has left an insurmountable peak and a huge vacuum for Chinese women&#39;s tennis. She has retired for more than nine years. At least so far, there has not been a player in Chinese women&#39;s tennis who can surpass her or even be on par with her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2011, when Li Na lifted her first Suzanne Langland Cup at Roland Garros in Paris, 9-year-old Zheng Qinwen was receiving tennis training in Wuhan under Li Na’s former coach Teacher Yu Liqiao. In her memory, it seemed that people all over the country were paying attention to Li Na&#39;s game that day. &quot;Li Na&#39;s victory planted a dream in me. One day I will also win a Grand Slam.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That was the third year that Zheng Qinwen officially started tennis training. In 2008, Zheng Qinwen&#39;s father took her to Beijing to watch the tennis match at the Olympic Games. Zheng Qinwen thought quietly. After the game, she and her father repeatedly discussed the details on the court and told her father that she was very interested in tennis. His father was once an athlete. He took Zheng Qinwen to play table tennis, badminton, basketball, and volleyball... His daughter was able to get started, but she was not outstanding. This time, he decided to let Zheng Qin play tennis. The coaches at Zheng Qinwen&#39;s hometown Shiyan Sports Center recognized her talent very much and believed that the power bursting out of her body was much higher than that of her peers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2014, Zheng Qinwen participated in the 12-year-old category of the National Youth Tennis Ranking Tournament and won the singles and doubles championships in one fell swoop. In the same year, the Shiyan Tennis Team she led participated in the 14th Hubei Provincial Games and won 2 gold medals. Her serving speed reached 169 kilometers per hour, which was outstanding in the country and the world at that time. Therefore, she was hailed as a &quot;genius girl&quot; by many domestic sports commentators. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Qinwen successfully entered the Beijing Wheel of Ingenuity Tennis School and received the guidance of Li Na’s mentor Carlos. Zheng Qinwen gradually grew from a talented player to a mature player with no shortcomings and comprehensive skills. In 2015, Zheng Qinwen won the championship in the 14-year-old group (12 to 14 years old) of the European Youth Tennis Tour. She has participated in many national and world tennis events and achieved outstanding results. When she was 16 years old, she participated in the French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open youth competitions, reaching the top 16 in each of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, my father contacted Spanish male tennis player Pere Riba, who had just retired as a coach, and the two parties decided to cooperate. Zheng Qinwen started training in Spain under the care of his mother. From Monday to Saturday, he had 2 hours of tennis training in the morning, 1 hour of physical training, and 2 hours of tennis training in the afternoon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2020, tennis competitions that were temporarily suspended due to the new crown epidemic resumed, and Zheng Qinwen began to participate frequently. In an interview with the media, Zheng Qinwen recalled that in order to more conveniently compete in Europe, the team would drive around Europe, driving from Barcelona to Germany, Italy and the Czech Republic. The furthest trip took 22 hours on the road. She didn&#39;t want to be eliminated in the first round and have to take a 22-hour drive home, so she worked very hard after playing. In order to maintain the best competitive condition, she hardly used the Internet during the competition, and even turned off her mobile phone when she arrived at the competition venue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2022, 19-year-old Zheng Qinwen participated in the French Open for the first time. She defeated Zanievska, Halep, and Koné successively, reaching the top 16 of the tournament, refreshing China The youngest age for a female tennis player to reach the top 16 in a Grand Slam tournament. In the fourth round, she faced Swiatek, ranked No. 1 in the world and the last French Open champion. The first set took more than 80 minutes. Zheng Qinwen broke Swiatek&#39;s 37-day record of no opponent winning a single set. He won the &quot;tiebreak&quot; 7-5 and won the first set with difficulty. In the second set, Zheng Qinwen suffered from a right thigh injury that affected his performance. In the end, he lost 1:2 and missed the top 8. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Zheng Qinwen unfortunately stopped in the top 16 of the French Open, but the comprehensive skills and playing temperament she displayed made fans all over the world remember &#39;Chinese Zheng&#39;. The potential shown by Zheng Qinwen makes us believe that this season She will also bring more surprises!&quot; People&#39;s Daily reported. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2020, when Zheng Qinwen first entered the professional arena, he was ranked 630th in the world. In the following more than two years, Zheng Qinwen won 8 ITF championships. He made history in his first Grand Slam tournament, reaching the second round of the Australian Open, the top 16 of the French Open, the top 32 of Wimbledon, and the top 32 of the US Open. WTA named him the &quot;Best Rookie of the 2022 Season&quot;. Because of her extremely fast rise in rankings, Zheng Qinwen was called the &quot;Rocket Girl&quot;. At the beginning of 2022, she promised to enter the top 30 in the world rankings, and at the end of the season, her ranking rose to 27th. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/qFP5ZUAxB24XmnPICsOAUT3BD2qtDUSWZNNcpqVd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/qFP5ZUAxB24XmnPICsOAUT3BD2qtDUSWZNNcpqVd.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252802&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 23, 2023, in the women&#39;s singles final of the Women&#39;s Tennis Players Association (WTA) 250 Palermo Station, Zheng Qinwen defeated Italian player Paolini 2-1 and won The first tour championship in her career &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Women&#39;s Tennis Players Association (WTA) official social account/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Queen Wen&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When the new season starts in 2023, Zheng Qinwen vows to enter the top ten in the world rankings. In the first half of the year, she went through a difficult downturn. In the 2023 Australian Open and French Open, Zheng Qinwen failed in the second round one after another. Before the start of Wimbledon, Zheng Qinwen changed coaches, replacing Spanish coach Riba with famous Belgian coach Wim Fiset, who has coached Naomi Osaka, Azarenka and other famous players. However, the grass court season was still hard for her to win, and Wimbledon ended with a first-round trip. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an interview, Zheng Qinwen said: &quot;Although I didn&#39;t play well in the grass-court season, I don&#39;t think my (strength) will decline. I will still work hard and prepare for the next stop. Change. The team must have had an impact, but I don’t think the loss was due to the coach.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before participating in the US Open, Zheng Qinwen went to Italy to participate in the WTA250 Palermo Station. She went all the way and won her first WTA tour-level championship in her career, and began to get out of the slump. &quot;This championship is hard-won. After experiencing failures, tears, regrets and disappointments, I finally tasted the taste of victory. I believe this is just the beginning.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a series of games before the US Open, Zheng Qinwen defeated Venus Williams and other famous players. After the start of the US Open, she quickly entered the state. Compared with before, she appeared calmer and more patient, with more swings and more frequent changes in long and short balls. She successfully broke into the top 16 of the US Open and expressed emotion in the interview: &quot;At the beginning of the year, I thought that reaching the second week of a Grand Slam was a basic operation, but I didn&#39;t expect that I would not have such a result until the last Grand Slam of the year. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, she defeated the 2022 tournament runner-up and No. 5 seed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, creating the best Grand Slam record in her career and becoming the sixth woman in the Open era to enter the Grand Slam singles. /China Tennis Association players in the 4 finals.

A relatively smooth growth process shaped her confident attitude and unruly temperament. During interviews, she often makes some sharp remarks. On August 12, 2022, in the third round of women&#39;s singles at the WTA1000 Toronto Station, Zheng Qinwen defeated Andreescu 7-5, 5-7, 6-2 and entered the quarterfinals of the WTA1000 competition for the first time. When asked if he would celebrate after reaching the top 8, Zheng Qinwen said: &quot;I will only celebrate after winning. I will be sad if I don&#39;t win.&quot; After the game, he talked about the match with former US Open champion Andreescu. , Zheng Qinwen responded domineeringly: &quot;I am stronger than her.&quot; When asked if he would work hard to win the US Open seed, Zheng Qinwen said: &quot;It really doesn&#39;t matter. My philosophy has always been that no matter who my opponent is, I Just do your best and strive to win.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her speech became an indicator of the player&#39;s personality, and she was called &quot;Queen Wen&quot; by fans.

After all, this is the Queen!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than half of the 2023 season has passed, and Zheng Qinwen is far from the top 10 in the world. There is still some distance. In an interview, she was asked why she always sets her goals very high, and why she always likes to speak out and take the initiative to withstand scrutiny from the outside world? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/hQ7JJXROxkfoyIlo0v8iU3ExH2k7g3YygxTB8n8T.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;2023年9月26日，菜鸟向港交所递交IPO申请文件，这是阿里巴巴启动“1+6+n”组织变革后首个分拆上市的业务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;招股书披露，菜鸟在2021年、2022年及2023年财政年度以及2023年3月30日－6月30日的三个月（下文简称最近的一季度），分别实现营收527.33亿元，668.67亿元、778亿元和231.64亿元，净利润分别是-16.88亿元、-20.04亿元、-23.25亿元和3.91亿元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也就是说，其上市前的三个完整财年累计亏损超60亿元，最近的一季度才扭亏为盈。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;菜鸟目前业务主要包括国际物流、国内物流、科技及其他服务三大板块。 2021年至2023财年（截至3月30日）及最近的一季度，其国际物流收入占比分别是55.1%、52.3%、47.4%、48.1%，都高于国内物流收入。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2013年，阿里巴巴集团、银泰集团联合复星集团、富春集团等一众浙江资本圈大佬，加上国内快递物流企业顺丰、“三通一达”共同成立菜鸟。彼时，银泰集团创始人沈国军为菜鸟网络CEO。不过，仅过了一年，沈就卸任CEO，任副董事长。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现任CEO万霖在2014年加入菜鸟，此前，他曾担任亚马逊全球物流部门的高级管理人员。 2017年，万霖正式执掌菜鸟，并让菜鸟成为阿里巴巴增长最快的业务板块之一。得益于此，万霖出现在阿里巴巴2023年最新披露的合伙人名单上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;押宝国际市场&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;也是在2017年，菜鸟的海外物流野心初显。这一年，菜鸟在吉隆坡推出首个e-Hub计划（综合电商物流枢纽），这成为通往东南亚电商市场的门户。主要针对速卖通跨境商家提供快递服务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;截至2023年6月30日，菜鸟已在全球建立两个面积超1.5万平方米的物流枢纽，分别位于马来西亚吉隆坡和比利时列日，预计将在香港建设第三个物流枢纽。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;菜鸟在跨境物流服务上的表现离不开阿里巴巴旗下跨境电商全球速卖通。全球速卖通（AliExpress）成立于2010年，被称为国际版“淘宝”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位女装行业的跨境电商从业者告诉南方周末记者，市面上可选择的平台有亚马逊、速卖通、虾皮（Shopee）、敦煌、E-bay，由于成本低，早期跨境电商创业者倾向于选择速卖通。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;亚马逊由于海外仓数量多，运输速度最快，欧美主要国家一星期左右能到货，偏远一点则需要半个月到一个月。 “快件到达当地后仍选择与当地邮局合作，派送时间由当地邮局决定。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;菜鸟以第三方服务的方式向速卖通商家提供快递服务，“比如递四方就是菜鸟旗下的快递企业。”她说。天眼查显示，菜鸟网络对深圳递四方信息科技有限公司持股45%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;招股书介绍，2022年，菜鸟国际物流服务收入较上年提升20%，最近的一季度比上年同期增长41%，主要原因都是速卖通的跨境快递服务显著增长。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了服务阿里巴巴生态体系内的电商平台外，菜鸟还在香港及一些海外市场如西班牙、法国、波兰等国建立了本地物流服务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;招股书引用的灼识咨询数据提到，跨境电商物流2018年至2022年复合年增长率超中国本地，尤其是中国跨境电商远超其他地区跨境电商。欧洲及美国预计成为来自中国跨境电商商品的主要终点。此外，东南亚和拉丁美洲亦有望高速增长。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据灼识咨询，2022年，菜鸟成为按包裹量计全球最大的跨境电商物流公司。前五名中，有两家中国公司，分别是菜鸟和EMS（中国邮政速递物流），剩余三家公司分别来自德国、法国和美国。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在国际市场上，菜鸟也将直面顺丰、极兔的挑战。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;9月15日刚刚在港交所上市的极兔也将目光投向全球市场。极兔是一家诞生于印度尼西亚的物流公司，截至2022年，其快递服务覆盖13个国家，东南亚市场份额最高。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;8月，顺丰公告将赴港二次上市，释出消息前，顺丰大手笔收购包括嘉里物流旗下亚太区和欧洲从事快递服务的10家附属公司。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据此前媒体报道，2019年至今，顺丰海外布局步履不停，先后投资美国货运物流服务商Flexport、德国DHL公司旗下敦豪香港和敦豪北京两家公司100%股权、缅甸物流公司KOSPA Limited，还与印尼Triputra集团成立合资公司等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;建全球最大物流网络&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;菜鸟招股书介绍，最近的一季度的毛利率较2022年同期有所提升，由10.6%升至13.7%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其营业成本主要包括履约成本（运输路线、配送、仓储处理及其他采购及管理的服务，即第三方服务）及劳务成本。劳务成本包括员工福利开支以及外包劳务服务，基本占比在20%左右。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;菜鸟在招股书中用“一杯咖啡价格送全球”来评价自身在跨境物流上提供的解决方案。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一名跨境电商从业者对南方周末记者表示，寄送一件T恤的价格在二三十元，与中国邮政相差无几，但相较国外的物流企业而言成本较低。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了价格便宜外，菜鸟为速卖通商家提供的物流方案也在送达时间上由一两个月缩短至十天，部分国际快线产品只需五天。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就在菜鸟递交IPO报告的同天，速卖通联合菜鸟上线“全球五日达”国际快线产品，首批落地英国、西班牙、荷兰、比利时和韩国。也就是说，这五个国家的消费者只要下单带有“五日达”标识的商品，只用五天就能收到来自中国的包裹。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上述从业者表示，五日达商品需要商家在客户下单48小时内提供包裹上网信息。上网率达标就能申请加入五日达，平台也会自动让商家加入。商家完成上网率也不难，通常一个链接做起来后都会囤一点货，买家一下单就能发出去，菜鸟每天都会上门收件。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如何做到降低成本又提高运输速度？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其招股书中引用灼识咨询资料，菜鸟在全球范围内建立了最大的物流网络，包括两个超1.5万平方米的物流枢纽中心、1100多个仓库和380多个分拣中心。 2023年6月，平均每周包机、包板约170班，超过2700条运输线路含4400多个网点及超过1.7万个驿站。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;科技也在发挥作用。如，人工智能AI的算法可以提升分拣准确性、改善库存管理、优化线路规划和车辆调度等。智能硬件上，有RFID、智能物联网设备、自动化及自动驾驶技术，包括AVG（自动化仓储技术）和电动无人配送车“小蛮驴”等。同时还提供数字化的供应链，便于监测、发现问题，提高效率。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年5月，阿里达摩院自动驾驶业务并入菜鸟集团，部分人员转入菜鸟，也就是说“大蛮驴”（自动驾驶卡车）和“小蛮驴”都归菜鸟。招股书介绍，截至2023年3月30日，已有800多辆小蛮驴投入使用，配送超过一千万件包裹。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/NzgzSpXJJwKMnxPPEpFsrvXwbWv21GI7T4uovkjt.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;1999年，NASA资助的“林肯近地小行星研究小组”发现了小行星Bennu（贝努，古埃及神话中的太阳神）。其赤道直径约500米，运行轨道位于金星和火星之间，与地球轨道有交叉，近地点约750万公里。这很快引起了美国“行星防御协调办公室”的注意，将其归类为“潜在危险天体”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经过持续观测和研究，科学家认为：“贝努”由碳和其它矿物质构成，在太阳系诞生之初就已存在，很可能含有地球生命最初形成时所存在的原始分子物质，实属珍贵的太阳系“第一手素材”。更重要的是，经反复精密计算，在2175-2199年之间，“贝努”有1/2700概率撞击地球，属于高风险太空目标。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，NASA制定了对这颗高危险、高价值小行星的探测任务，全称为“（太阳系）起源、光谱解析、资源识别、安全、风化层勘探（Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security, Regolith Explorer）”，意为：。这个冗长的专业名称，被缩写为“OSIRIS-Rex”，借用古埃及神话中的冥界之神“奥西里斯”，中文简称“冥王”号。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2016年9月8日，运载“冥王”号探测器的火箭升空。 2018年12月31日，探测器进入距其仅1.6-2.1公里的环“贝努”轨道，这是人类探测器首次成功环绕体积、质量、引力都如此小的小天体长期飞行。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在此后1年多时间里，“冥王”号多次精细变轨，在多种不同高度对小行星进行了非常详细的探测，对重点考察区域，探测器飞掠高度甚至降低到距离小行星表面仅250米，这需要极高的飞控科技。探测器的PolyCam相机，用2155张照片拼出了它的超高清全球影像，分辨率高达5厘米/像素，是人类迄今为止获取的最高清的地外天体全球影像图，因此，“贝努”成为迄今为止人类在太阳系中最了解的小行星之一。在2018年底，探测器在其表面发现了水的痕迹。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管环绕勘测非常详尽、精细，但登陆小行星表面取样却更加困难。 NASA的科学家们发现：原先预计的直径约50米平坦着陆区，真实情况是乱石嶙峋，有可能进行着陆的区域直径最多仅约6米，超预期的难度会损坏“冥王”号着陆器。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;科学家们紧急应变：变更了原方案，开发出基于光学影像的备用导航定位方案——自然特征跟踪技术，以“蜻蜓点水”的轻柔姿态一触即离。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2020年10月20日，“冥王”号探测器降落在“夜莺”采样区。直径0.3米的采样头与星体表面接触了约6秒钟，将小行星表面的碎石和尘埃颗粒收入囊中，然后点火离开。修改后的应变方案异乎寻常地成功：探测器采集了约250克样本，远超过原本计划中的60克样本任务要求。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2020年10月28日，“冥王”号将采集到的样品封装入返回舱。 2021年5月10日，探测器带着珍贵的小行星采样，启程返航地球轨道，并于2023年9月24日，准确成功将返回舱降落到犹他州沙漠实验基地。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;NASA公布的计划：在接下来的两年时间里，样本25%将被送到多国约200名科学家手中进行研究。其余75%样本将被封存数十年，等待未来科技进步，更先进的新技术和装备出现后，再分批取出样本开展研究。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;奇妙的是，“冥王”号探测任务并未结束，它把样品返回舱抛射回地球后，将借助地球的“引力弹弓效应”，飞往另一颗小行星Apophis（阿波菲斯，埃及神话中的破坏和混沌之神）。此后，“冥王”号任务代号将更名为“阿波菲斯探险者”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“阿波菲斯”是比“贝努”更小但更危险的小行星，其直径约370米。在2029年将从距地球约3.2万公里处高速掠过，这比距地面3.6万公里的地球静止轨道卫星还近，有2.7%的概率撞上地球。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;直径大于140米的小行星，被称为“灭国者”，如果撞上中等国家，直接毁灭之；即便是领土面积最大的几个大国，若被砸中也会就此衰落。而直径10公里以上的小行星，是“行星毁灭者”，能把地球撞碎。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“冥王/阿波菲斯探险者”任务团队的科学家们，将在小行星于2029年4月13日飞掠地球时，操控探测器进入其环绕轨道，进行为期18个月的“阿波菲斯”近距离探索，对其进行全面考察，以便研究近地小行星的运动特性。最后，探测器将开启推进系统，搅动小行星表面，以研究其地表之下的物质和结构。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很显然，“OSIRIS-Rex”项目的科学家团队，并不太在意2.7%小行星撞击率，行星防御并非其项目内的研究任务。下一步，要看NASA是否会利用2029年“阿波菲斯”送到家门口的机会，再次尝试“行星防御”项目实验，利用火箭推力，改变小行星轨道，将其推得距离地球远一点。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“冥王/阿波菲斯探险者”任务，其复杂与奇幻程度，已经有些类似《星际迷航》般的探索之旅：对未来的展望、对未知领域的好奇、对科学探索持之以恒、对梦想的执着、天马行空般的想象力、技术层面的精益求精……共同交织成还远没有结束的传奇。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;

data-key=&quot;252367&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年9月13日，浙江湖州，邱佳红再次来到陈美凤住处。 （南方周末记者郑丹/图）&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;胎龄8个多月，早产，头发黑黑的，是个男婴。关于未谋面的孩子，这是37岁的邱佳红知道的全部。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2022年9月16日23时35分，刚经历剖腹引产的邱佳红从全身麻醉中醒来，孩子的父亲郑小兵告诉她，取出来的婴儿是死的，被医生抱走了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在邱佳红的讲述中，自己原本健康的胎儿临产时被医院告知“孩子缺氧，脑神经不正常，要打掉的”。半年后，她突然意识到不对劲。在剖腹引产手术的头天下午，她接到过一个显示为浙江湖州号码的电话，连续打来两次，电话那头的老太太问她，孩子送人吗？ “莫名其妙，我说怎么可能送人，就挂了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;随着诸多疑点一点点浮现，邱佳红怀疑自己是中了人贩子的圈套。成为“猎物”并不是没有缘故，那是一个让她难以启齿的原因——自己未婚生育的孩子，是郑小兵的私生子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;邱佳红相信孩子还活着。她决定顺着那串陌生号码寻子，没曾想，阴差阳错掀开一起地下代孕、贩卖儿童大案。截至2023年9月13日，侦办该案的警方查明涉及多名被买卖儿童。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;雇私家侦探寻子&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;雨下了一早上，灰蒙蒙的粮油批发市场里人少，安静，成排的卷帘门大多被拉下来，偶尔几个外卖员来去穿梭。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;身材瘦小的邱佳红领着南方周末记者，在市场里三拐两拐，熟练地钻进靠边的一幢居民楼，顺着贴满牛皮癣小广告的楼道到203室门前。这家住户就是当初给她打电话的老太太，如今已经置身于拘留所。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;老太太名叫陈美凤，58岁，福建莆田人。那张脸邱佳红记得清楚，文两道弯眉，耷拉着深眼袋，圆脸盘，高颧骨，挨肩炸开的一头灰发用发箍卡紧。她体型偏胖，冬日里时常裹一件黑色貂皮大衣，蹬一双黑筒靴，脚底有劲儿。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;半年前，2023年2月，邱佳红雇佣两名私家侦探，三人驱车从上海前往浙江湖州找到陈美凤的住处，试图在这里找到当初从医院消失的儿子。她回忆，挨着冻在楼下蹲点一周，也没有见到陈美凤抱着五六月大的男婴出没过一次。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与陈美凤的正面对峙，发生在他们蹲点的第8天。 2月23日，邱佳红一早在203室门口堵住了散步回来的陈美凤：“陈阿姨，你认得我吗？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“不认得”，陈美凤的普通话里夹杂着浓重的莆田口音，她客气地将来者请进屋里坐，老头子在给小孙女烧饭，屋里有些杂乱。邱佳红目光扫了一圈屋子，没有男婴。她又问一句，“那我的号码你从哪里来的？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陈美凤才明白邱佳红的来意，“没打过”，她说，一会儿又咕哝，“不记得了”。在邱佳红的执意要求下，陈美凤被陪同前往附近一处移动营业厅调取半年内的通讯记录，邱佳红的电话号码果然出现在其中，通话时间为2022年9月15日16时29分。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/ed9bdd81dc.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;708&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/ed9bdd81dc.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252368&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年2月一天清晨， 陈美凤抱孙女回屋。 （受访者供图/图）&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;当时的邱佳红并没有注意，在陈美凤给她打电话前后，还和同一人打过3通电话，后来发现是浙江美福宝妇儿医院（以下简称美福宝医院）院长陈勇进的号码。 2022年9月16日，邱佳红就在杭州的美福宝医院生产。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;后来邱佳红从警方得知，这二人是莆田老乡。陈勇进就此事的回应是，“有可能是我告诉陈美凤（邱佳红联系方式）的，我不确定。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;邱佳红想起，剖腹产手术后第三天，开刀医生于艳芬走进她的病房拉家常，“我当时痛得有点迷迷糊糊，她跟我聊了有两小时，问我家里兄弟姐妹都是做什么的，先生是做什么的，怎么认识的，聊得跟自己人一样。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“一系列回想以后觉得不对，她到我病房肯定是来打探消息的。”邱佳红认定，孩子活着，但被陈美凤跟美福宝医院卖了；男友郑小兵也有把孩子“送出去”的嫌疑，两人因此闹僵，分道扬镳。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;面对邱佳红和私家侦探逼问孩子下落，陈美凤带着哭腔，“我真的不记得（打电话给邱佳红），我没做过（拐卖邱佳红之子）。”在一段2月23日的现场视频中，陈美凤主动提出，“要不我们去派出所吧。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;当晚，邱佳红报案，陈美凤被抓。次日，浙江省湖州市公安局湖州南太湖新区分局就下了立案决定书：根据《中华人民共和国刑事诉讼法》第一百零九条之规定，决定对南太湖新区拐卖妇女、儿童案立案侦查。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;半年后，侦办该案的警方告诉邱佳红，陈美凤主要通过卖婴儿和代孕生意获利。就卖儿童一事，经调查已经发现多名被卖的孩童，案件受到公安部重视。而代孕生意虽然违法，但并不属于犯罪行为，故不在本次警方调查范围内。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;门背后的东南亚代孕姑娘&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;捅破陈美凤的代孕窝点，纯属意外。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;邱佳红一行人在粮油批发市场蹲点那段日子，摸清楚的信息其实不多：大概是陈美凤夫妇、儿子儿媳，以及两个孙女一家六口住在这里，他们很少出门，不喜与邻舍打招呼。偶尔婆媳俩会轮流开一辆黑色宝马出门，去得最勤快的地方，是附近的湖州玛丽亚妇产医院。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;邱佳红发现，每天傍晚，陈美凤会抱着自家小孙女绕到后排，消失在另一幢居民楼里的407室，早晨六七点钟，又回到203室。白天，陈美凤的儿媳会拎着饭盒，骑一辆电动车两度往返于前后排房屋。婆媳俩离开407室时，都会将钥匙插进门孔，拧上几圈。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;起初几天，邱佳红还听到过203室里传来婴儿的啼哭声，陈美凤在里面哼着调子哄孩子。挂在门口的小奶箱每早会收到一盒婴儿食用的鲜羊奶。几天后，啼哭声彻底消失了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;邱佳红猜测那哭声就是自己儿子的，很可能因为闹腾，孩子被陈美凤安顿在后排的407室。 “有一次晚上，我跟上去偷偷听，里面有好多人的声音，我觉得不对。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;如果不是亲眼看到，她怎么都不会相信，在407室那扇门背后，其实是3个来自东南亚国家的代孕姑娘，个个20岁左右的年纪，其中两个挺着大肚子。邱佳红看到时，她们正躺在床上，刷着没有安装电话卡的智能手机。屋内摆设杂乱，打开冰箱，是满满当当的保胎药和补血药，垃圾桶里丢有废弃的医用材料。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在一则邱佳红与同行私家侦探于2月23日进屋后录制的视频中，一个自称丽丽的女子起初沉默不语，后用不熟练的中文表达，自己来自越南，已经怀孕6个月，旁边床上的姑娘怀胎3月。俩人中间的床头桌上，放了一盒预防和治疗缺铁性贫血的胶囊。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当被问及生一个孩子能赚多少钱，丽丽回答，“不知道，我还没生过，生好才知道给钱多少。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她称通过姐姐介绍找到陈美凤，“我姐在这儿生过，生好她已经回去了。她生的是女孩，说有2万多（人民币）”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;407室内阁楼上住的另一位女子，则称是通过短视频软件上的网友介绍来的。在一段视频中，这位女子称自己刚来不久，还没有怀孕。 “有人给我介绍来这里，让陈阿姨帮我找工作，我就过来了。”当初介绍她过来的人联系方式已经遗失，因为“手机没卡，电话都删掉了”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;后经湖州警方查明，代孕女子中，有两名来自柬埔寨。 “两个姑娘都是有签证过来的，在这边都嫁人了。代孕的都是父母双方（买家）提供精子卵子，只是借个母体。”9月13日，南方周末记者陪同邱佳红前往湖州康山派出所询问案情时，一名派出所民警说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;按照流程，老程每次接到孕妈后，会安排她们先做全套体检。 “合格的在我们这边住下来，等她们一来例假，早期就让她们吃助孕药，建立人工周期，监测子宫内膜，找到合适的机会安排移植胚胎。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在一条完整的代孕产业链里，包括买家、孕妈、代孕机构用于做试管的私人实验室，以及可以开具虚假出生证明的妇产医院。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;原卫生部2003年修订的《人类辅助生殖技术规范》明确规定，禁止以任何形式买卖配子、合子、胚胎，医疗机构和医务人员不得实施任何形式的代孕技术。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;然而，这一规章仅仅是对医疗机构、医务人员产生约束力，并不能制止医疗机构之外的组织和个人实施代孕。民法典未对代孕进行明文规制，代孕成为一门常年游走在灰色地带的地下生意。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“说白了，我们做这个事情，你（买家）我（卖家）都没有风险，因为是在法律的空白地带。所有风险集中在医生和医疗机构，一是前面医生做试管的环节，要把精卵移植到孕妈这边，风险很高；二是后面的生产环节，医院需要把孩子出生证明写成你们夫妻双方（买家）名字，也是有风险的。”老程说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;针对在上海想找代孕的客户，老程开价68万元包成功，客户另加8万元可以指定孩子性别。 “公立医院监控比较严格，不太好操作试管，基本上都是在外面的智能实验室。如果你要求必须在公立三甲医院做试管，我们也可以安排，再加8万。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;按陈美凤丈夫武玉嶂的说法，曾经，陈美凤也想在莆田开一家用于代孕的门店。 2020年11月，她在老家注册了莆田市添丁健康管理有限公司。 “莆田这边没有（代孕），看开一家怎么样。注册好了，结果做不成，就没开了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;南方周末记者走访发现，这是一处设在住宅区的小微企业，没有招牌，也没有门面。由于两次未依规公示年度报告，该公司已经被列入经营异常名单。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;打“擦边球”的接生医院&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023年9月10日，南方周末记者以找代孕为由，在莆田见到了目前在取保候审期间的武玉嶂。 60岁的他跟儿子两人生活在老家。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“我们早就没有做（代孕）了，才做一年，就没做了。”当得知来者要找陈美凤时，武玉嶂提高了警惕，“我这几年都在家里没出去，她在上海那边工作，在哪里搞不清楚。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;他面前的客厅空荡荡的，摆在地上的玩具小马驹上挂着一个湖州玛丽亚妇产医院的手提袋。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在武玉嶂的讲述中，十来年前，陈美凤跟他在家做鞋模，“我们自己办一个厂，招了三十多个工人，钱都是她管的。”等到儿子出去读书以后，陈美凤提出要到外面挣钱，说是莆田一个朋友介绍她跑医院的业务。那是个到处拉病人去医院看病的活儿，有时也会将一家医院的病人介绍到另一家医院，从中赚取小额介绍费。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;湖州玛丽亚妇产医院是陈美凤较为固定的上班地点，该医院的工作人员也向南方周末记者证实，“陈美凤以前经常带人过来看病，这半年没见来了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“她会看病，去医院培训了几年，里面的医生给她培训，特别女孩子什么病要吃什么药，要花多少钱，她都懂。”武玉嶂说，陈美凤念过高中，懂的多，还办了护照。 “她专门和妇产科医院打交道，跟浙江、上海那边很多医院都熟悉，三甲医院也熟。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;这份工作的另一面，是在医院物色合适的婴儿进行贩卖。据警方知情人士透露，在贩婴链条上，陈美凤属“买卖介绍”的角色，她常年在数家医院跑来跑去，涉案医生私下为其提供一些引产或打算产后弃婴的父母相关信息，她则去劝说、哄骗这些父母生下孩子，交与她处置。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“陈美凤被抓了，也牵连到我这里，我当场就被公安抓去调查。警方以为我在勾结陈美凤贩卖婴儿，但实际上我当时只接了代孕的。”9月22日，陈勇进告诉南方周末记者，陈美凤被抓后，美福宝医院里很多医生都一同被警方带走做笔录，当初为邱佳红做剖腹产手术的医生于艳芬已经辞职，“她当时也被处罚了，反正这个事情搞得挺大的。”&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;陈春来是知名上市药企上海美迪西生物医药股份有限公司的10大股东之一。公开资料显示，陈春来也是该上市公司总经理陈春麟的弟弟。和上海美迪西生物的其他几位陈姓核心高管一样，他们都来自“莆田四大家族”之一的陈氏家族。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“出事之前，我们接过很多代孕的，现在都不做了。”陈勇进称，过去，陈美凤时常会带一些孕妇来美福宝医院生产。每接一单代孕生意，就意味着医院要造假一份出生证明，在婴儿父母一栏填上买家的名字。 “她卖的十几个孩子中，大概有四五个在我这里生的，她跟我讲，这些小孩子都是代孕的，生完之后他们私底下去卖。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“代孕和拐卖儿童是两码事，对于我们院方来讲，我敢做（打）擦边球的事情，被发现了顶多罚点钱，但我绝对不敢做完完全全犯法的事情。我们一天营业额30万，一年营业额100亿，这么大医院，不至于冒这个风险。”陈勇进向南方周末记者强调，美福宝医院从未参与过陈美凤贩卖儿童的违法行为，此前也不知情。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023年9月15日，杭州市拱墅区卫生健康局因美福宝医院未按规定填写、保管病历资料等，对其罚款14万元。该处罚决定书还提到，2021年1月28日至2022年3月27日，美福宝医院出具了6份虚假出生医学证明，已构成违法。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“那就是6个（以代孕为名接生的孩子）嘛，陈美凤带来生的不止6个，还有很多其他的，可能真的是有做试管，可能有其他的，我们又不清楚的。”陈勇进说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;关于美福宝医院是否涉及贩卖儿童，拱墅区卫生健康局与警方均未透露相关信息，上述处罚决定书也未提及。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/d3a9ed3cb5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;747&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/d3a9ed3cb5.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;如今，在陈美凤老家莆田市荔城区的村子里，鲜有人知道她的名字。巷子深处行人稀少，青石砖道两边是有些年代的水泥小楼，一些敞开大门的客厅里供奉着妈祖或财神爷，空气中弥漫着香火味。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“原来的村子拆了，大家都搬出去了。”一位年迈的村民告诉南方周末记者，“她好多年没回来了，只听说在外面做医药什么的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;陈美凤出去之后，武玉嶂称因为批量出售鞋模被客户赊账太多，几十万收不回来，也不干了。他将自家三层小楼和两个仓库都租出去，一年收十几万元的房租。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;再后来，武玉嶂前往浙江湖州，给陈美凤打后勤，每天负责买菜烧饭，收拾屋子。 “我问过她一两次（生意的事），她说你问那么多干嘛，你反正有钱花就可以，还管那么多。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;武玉嶂并不是什么都不知道，“（代孕）女人太难找，我们也是从云南昆明那边找过来的，不容易。他们（陈美凤等）以前也到泰国去做（代孕生意），泰国可能比较贵。”武玉嶂含糊地说，买家可以提前挑选婴儿性别，价格在55万元到60万元；代买家看着代孕姑娘从怀孕到生完孩子，总报价65万元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;实际上，这是一个略低于市场行情的价位。南方周末记者询问多家地下代孕机构，起步价均在70万元左右，但这些机构均表示，孕妈全部来自国内，没有国外孕妈的渠道。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;陈美凤从一单代孕生意中能分多少钱？她是否会通过医院渠道买卖现成的婴儿？武玉嶂均表示“搞不清楚”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;前述警方知情人士称，陈美凤在贩卖儿童的交易中，会根据孩子身体健康情况，定价在一个孩子十几万元到二三十万元不等，她从中拿几千到两三万元提成。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;截至9月13日，警方查到经陈美凤之手买卖且有迹可循的多个孩子，卖出前均取得过孩子亲生父母同意。 “她认为干这个事情不是拐卖，而是做好事。因为一边不要小孩子，一边需要小孩子。她把不要的小孩给到需要的，途中牵个线，收个辛苦费。”陈美凤因此将所有交易记录和聊天记录都保留下来，于她而言，这都是“积德”的证明。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;10年前，由公安部督办的特大拐卖妇女儿童案主犯谭永志在被捕后，也称自己是在做好事。 “我是帮助人，人家要小孩了，我就给牵个线，我没有直接找人卖小孩。”据央视新闻，从2008年到2013年，谭永志组织或参与买卖22名儿童，每个孩子售价在1.5万-5万元不等，谭永志每单赚介绍费1000-6000元不等，总计获利十几万元。最终，河南省高级人民法院对谭永志判处死刑，最高人民法院于2016年核准。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;前述知情人士称，与传统意义上的拐卖不同，陈美凤这起拐卖儿童案中带有抱养、领养的性质。在陈美凤的过往交易中，曾有一对父母将自己的孩子卖了17万元，陈从中拿几千元“奶粉钱”。后这对父母嫌17万元少，又去找陈美凤讨钱，不多给就报警。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023年9月26日，南方周末记者致电湖州康山派出所，询问该案进展。警方表示，该案由湖州市公安局湖州南太湖新区分局侦办，其他情况暂不便透露。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;另一个版本&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;那些被陈美凤贩卖的孩子，有的患先天性疾病或残疾，有的是因父母非婚生育“不好处理”。但其中并没有邱佳红之子。警方在陈美凤近几年的交易记录和聊天记录中，也没有找到相关线索。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;按照警方透露的陈美凤说法，当初邱佳红在电话里不同意卖，陈就自称打消了念头。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“孩子就是死掉了呀，按照她的意愿把孩子打掉了，送火葬场去了。”关于邱佳红之子，陈勇进告诉南方周末记者的是另一个版本：邱佳红最初向客服咨询能否打掉孩子，称孩子“有点问题”；2022年8月22日，她来医院做完检查一度犹豫，大概一个月左右又表示确定要打掉孩子。 “有个男的（郑小兵）陪着过来的，态度也是把孩子打掉。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“我们的问题只有一处，法律规定28周以上的胎儿不能做引产，所以我们在病历中把邱佳红的胎龄改小了，其它全部是真实的。”面对南方周末记者追问邱佳红之子下落，陈勇进反问：“如果孩子是活的，我们是要打出生证明的。刑警已经调查过了，十几个孩子买家卖家查得清清楚楚，差她一个孩子吗？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot;

data-key=&quot;252372&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年9月15日，监管部门对美福宝医院的处罚决定。 （资料图/图）&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;据杭州市拱墅区卫生健康局调查，自2022年4月后，美福宝医院通过不出具B超检查报告单、伪造中期孕周等方式，开展孕周28周以上的大月份孕妇引产业务，具体引产数据未登记难以统计。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;拱墅区卫生健康局公开的处罚决定书还提及，2022年9月15日至16日，美福宝医院为实际孕周37周2天的邱佳红实施了米非司酮联合依沙吖啶注射液羊膜腔穿刺引产手术及剖宫取胎术。对此，邱佳红说，“米非司酮片我只吃了两粒，根本不会起效，也没有打引产针（依沙吖啶注射液）。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;被邱佳红多次催问案情后，警方告诉邱佳红，陈美凤案的调查如今已接近尾声，但在已有证据中，没有任何关于她的婴儿是活胎的线索。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“郑小兵、陈美凤以及给陈美凤打下手的小马仔，我们都问过了，没有孩子的线索。”2023年9月13日，当提及孩子父亲郑小兵时，派出所民警称：“最清楚（孩子情况）的，是那个人。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;此后，南方周末记者致电郑小兵询问是否知道孩子下落，对方称“我不知道这回事情”，挂掉了电话。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;9月16日是孩子满一周岁的日子，邱佳红独自开车去上海郊区的村庄找人算命。算命的看过几根香火生烟的走势后，告诉她孩子还在，邱佳红感觉心安了一些。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
