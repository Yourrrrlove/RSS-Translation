(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Become a reporter,&amp;nbsp; It was a child soldier&#39;s wish in middle school. But in more than ten years of study experience, he found that his ideal is still to &quot;engage in academics and do research.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After graduating from the Journalism Department of Fudan University in 1968, the child soldiers were assigned to participate in labor training in Horqin, Inner Mongolia. In 1970, the &quot;Jintie News&quot; accidentally discovered their writing skills to become a journalist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The tide of the times is carrying budding journalism students drifting in unknown directions. In 1977, news came that the country had resumed the college entrance examination. The child soldiers who were far away from the border regained their fighting spirit to study, and the following year they were admitted to the postgraduate degree in the Chinese Department of Peking University. This year, a full ten years have passed since the child soldier graduated from college. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;His mentor during his master&#39;s and doctoral studies was journalism educator Gan Xifen. Following in the footsteps of his mentor, Tong Bing devoted himself to the research of Marxist journalism concepts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Opening up a new research direction requires a lot of basic reading support. Within one year, Tong Bing read through more than 4,000 papers with the word &quot;horse&quot; in them, and also read through all 50 volumes of the complete works of Marx and Engels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The complete works of Marx and Engels were published in batches. After the first 39 volumes were read, the last 11 volumes were not published until 1985.&quot; Tong Bing said that at that time, the most complete new books could only be seen at the former Central Compilation and Translation Bureau. The child soldier who was still a &quot;poor student&quot; often brought two steamed buns and a cup of boiling water to read in the Translation and Compilation Bureau, sitting there all day long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After graduating with his doctorate in 1988, Tong Bing stayed at Renmin University of China to take up a teaching position. In more than 40 years of research and teaching career, he has published more than 700 academic papers, published and edited more than 50 books, textbooks, dictionaries, etc., and successively published the &quot;History of Marxist Journalism Thought&quot; and &quot;The History of Marxist Journalism Thought&quot;. Academic monographs such as &quot;Classic Course of Marxist Journalism&quot;, &quot;Introduction to Theoretical Journalism and Communication&quot;, &quot;Journalism Theory&quot;, &quot;Comparative Journalism and Communication&quot;, &quot;Subject and Mouthpiece - An Examination of the Trajectory of News Communication in the Republic&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;This is how I have been through these years. It can be said that there is no time to breathe and no chance to sleep peacefully. I am constantly breaking through new tasks. Although it was tiring at the time, looking back now, I think it was worth it,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As the first PhD in journalism independently trained in China, Tong Bing has experienced the process of postgraduate journalism education from scratch, and witnessed the development of Renmin University of China, The development of journalism at Fudan University, one of the two famous universities in the north and the other in the south. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Do knowledge simply and plainly, but don&#39;t do simple learning&quot; and &quot;Don&#39;t dare to waste a day in life&quot; are the creeds he mentioned many times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Already octogenarian, Tong Bing is currently a senior professor of liberal arts at Fudan University, still standing on the three-foot podium teaching journalism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Truth&quot; is a key word for Tong Bing&#39;s academic studies. He once used the four &quot;truths&quot; of &quot;true learning, true understanding, true belief, and true application&quot; The words summarized his lifelong academic insights. His pursuit of truth in learning also allowed him to repeatedly speak out about the shortcomings of the journalism community and the industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Journalism research has entered a new era. He directly stated the shortcomings of the development of the discipline, &quot;Among various disciplines, the discipline construction of journalism has developed slowly.&quot; In his It seems that in order to solve the development problems of journalism, &quot;it is necessary to calmly spread out the problems and conduct in-depth analysis. This may be good.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;My ideal is not here. Place&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>; When taking the college entrance examination in 1963 , why did you apply for the Journalism Department of Fudan University? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tong Bing:&lt;/strong>; I wanted to be a reporter when I was in middle school. At that time, I was a student cadre and the president of the student union. I was no stranger to news. . Student cadres who want to take the liberal arts major usually choose the Department of Politics, the Department of International Politics, and the Department of Journalism. At that time, the universities with the best journalism departments in my country were Renmin University in the north and Fudan University in the south. My parents didn’t want me to leave Shanghai, so I took the Fudan exam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend&lt;/strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong>;：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/ span>;It took ten years between graduating from undergraduate degree and applying for graduate school. Can you talk about this experience? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tong Bing:&lt;/strong>; When I graduated from my undergraduate degree, it was at the end of the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; and I was assigned to participate in labor training in the Northeast. I started out as a road maintenance worker building railroads. At that time, all major railway bureaus in our country had enterprise newspapers, and Jinzhou Railway had an enterprise newspaper called &quot;Jintie News&quot;. More than half a year later, they found out about me and transferred me to the newspaper as an editor and reporter. The newspaper office often holds correspondent training classes. Since I major in journalism, I often give lectures and have a relatively harmonious relationship with everyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After staying there for a while, our country resumed the college entrance examination. At first, the railway didn’t want to let me go because I had already graduated from my undergraduate degree. But later, the Jinzhou Railway Bureau heard that both Renmin University and Fudan University were recruiting master&#39;s degree students (there were no graduate students in the journalism major before) and agreed that I would try to take the exam. I passed the exam right away and was the first batch of master&#39;s students recruited in our country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;Reform and opening up on your personal destiny What is the impact? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tong Bing:&lt;/strong>; The changes in my personal destiny are closely linked to reform and opening up. Sometimes I often say in meetings or classes that I am very grateful to Deng Xiaoping. If the college entrance examination and university admissions are not resumed, I may still be a reporter at the Jinzhou Railway Bureau tabloid for the rest of my life. If I do well, I may be promoted to deputy editor-in-chief or editor-in-chief. However, my ideal is not in this place. I still want to engage in academics and theory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>; During graduate school, Professor Gan was How did that guide you? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tong Bing:&lt;/strong>; Mr. Gan Xifen is also recruiting graduate students for the first time, and his requirements for me are relatively strict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There were pilot projects before the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, but they could not be carried out after a while, so there was no master&#39;s degree in journalism before 1978. The lifelong wish of these old gentlemen is to push forward journalism research. The National People&#39;s Congress and Fudan University were the first to do relevant work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Mr. Gan Xifen emphasized two points when guiding me. The first point is to read the original works. He believes that graduate students in journalism should learn more classic works; the second point is to practice. I always insisted on these two points while studying at Renmin University, and I persisted relatively well. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;How do you insist on these two points? required? What are the specific methods? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tong Bing:&lt;/strong>; I had classes during the day, read in the afternoon, and went to the journalism department office around 4 o&#39;clock to read the day&#39;s newspapers. , we poor students could not afford to subscribe to newspapers at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When I come back from the classroom and library at 9pm, I review the day&#39;s newspapers in the dormitory, including the day&#39;s &quot;People&#39;s Daily&quot; and &quot;China Youth Daily&quot;. The review is conducted 5 nights a week, each person is responsible for one week, and several people take turns. The students responsible for reviewing the newspaper should take notes and write a report every week, which should be sent to the newspaper. The newspaper also attaches great importance to our opinions and will reply to us every once in a while. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This arrangement is very helpful to our study. After a 3-year master&#39;s degree, I stuck to this method for almost 3 years. We also have many contacts with news organizations and have a relatively close relationship. I did the same thing until I stayed in school to become a teacher after graduation. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Continuously opening new courses and recruiting new students&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt; /strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;strong>;1&lt;/strong>;In 1983, the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council agreed to establish a doctorate in journalism. Under the background of that time, if you graduate with a master&#39;s degree and work as a university teacher, your academic qualifications are enough. Why do you continue to study for a doctorate? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Child Soldier:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;One is because of the need for theoretical study , studying for a doctoral degree will give you the opportunity to audit courses in many other majors at Renmin University. For example, I have listened to history, scientific socialism, and international politics. When I went to attend classes, none of the teachers refused. They saw that I was not too young and still eager to learn, so they generally allowed me to enter their classrooms. I often asked questions in class, and they really treated me in this regard. Very considerate: When I go to ask questions after class, other teachers or classmates will stop and let me (ask questions first). In the process of my study, it can be said that many teachers from relevant majors at Renmin University have helped me a lot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, my supervisor and other teachers in the journalism department hope that I can take the lead in helping the school establish a doctoral program in journalism. Later, the State Education Commission agreed that journalism would have a doctoral degree. At that time, China began to have doctoral programs (in journalism), and two schools were approved, one was the Journalism Department of Fudan University, and the other was the Journalism Department of Renmin University of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;After graduating from the Ph.D., you stayed He taught at the National People&#39;s Congress and returned to his alma mater, Fudan University, in 2001. What did you think at that time? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tong Bing:&lt;/strong>;After completing my master&#39;s degree at Renmin University, I stayed in school because of the needs of school work. At that time, our journalism industry was in great need of talents, and young people wanted to join it and go out into the society. But the instructor said something to me, which moved me very much. The Cultural Revolution delayed it for ten years, and they really wanted to restore our major as soon as possible, so they hoped that I could stay and teach in this school with peace of mind. Only by staying in this profession and being a good teacher can this profession continue to have new talents and new developments. I quickly accepted the arrangements in the school and worked hard. I have done a lot of pioneering work over the past few decades. It is very worthwhile when I think about it now. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Moving from the National People&#39;s Congress to teaching at Fudan is also an adjustment arrangement for the school. At that time, Fudan was in great need of people. Compared with Renmin University, Fudan&#39;s development is more international. Many outstanding students have gone abroad after graduation. The teachers are getting older and their health is getting worse every year. We teachers and students know each other very well, and we see this situation with our eyes and are anxious in our hearts. Therefore, the school raised this expectation and hoped that we can come back to shoulder the heavy burden. I came back without saying anything. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the beginning, there was a lot of pressure and a heavy burden. Journalism was delayed for many years by the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; and is in urgent need of development. The desire for talents is everywhere. So whether I stayed at the National People&#39;s Congress or was later called by Fudan University, I just taught with peace of mind, constantly opening new courses and recruiting new students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This has been the case for these years. It can be said that when there is no time to breathe, there is no chance to sleep peacefully. Although we were very tired at the time, we soon overcame these difficulties and continued to make new progress in our work. Looking back now, I still think it was worth it. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Understand your mission”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt; /strong>;&lt;/span>;In your opinion, what is the overall shift in current journalism research and what are its deficiencies? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tong Bing: &lt;/strong>;Differences in theoretical viewpoints are inevitable, natural, and reasonable. (The development of journalism research) I think it ultimately depends on the progress of journalism practice. You are right to insist on your point of view. As a result, newspapers and radio and television have been successfully run. This shows that theory guides practice. On the other hand, if your theory is sound and sound, but no one reads your newspaper or listens to your broadcast, it shows that your theory has no power. Isn&#39;t this a problem? This is where we theorists feel ashamed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, there is still a strong culture of self-appreciation in the academic world, which should not be the case. The academic community should review this and analyze the reasons behind it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;Journalism has always faced the &quot;news What do you think of the questioning and debate about &quot;no learning&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tongbing:&lt;/strong>; The &quot;no-learning theory&quot; has long-term influence on the development of journalism, mainly due to several circumstances. Journalism started relatively late, and there are not many independent scholarships and works. The aspect of journalism that has a deeper impact on China is practice. Running newspapers, radio stations, and television stations are all based on practical work. There are not many people who actually engage in theoretical research, and achievements have not been achieved. Not big either. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;These understandings affect the status and image of journalism in various liberal arts majors. After we got PhDs, China&#39;s journalism research gradually got on the right track and started to have something decent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;How do you understand journalists Mission? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Child Soldier:&lt;/strong>; Journalists must understand their mission. The simplest and simplest requirement is to report the truth to the people. , real news, that’s the most important thing. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;Journalism Freshman Can you give some life advice to college students who have just entered school? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tong Bing:&lt;/strong>; This is a very broad proposition. I think the life development of college students is the same as the operation characteristics of our entire country. , one wave after another, one tide after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As teachers, we hope that the new students can inherit the good traditions of the school and develop them stronger, so that the university will become better and better, and the college students themselves will also become better and better. We can continue to make progress. Only in this way will our country become better and better and our career become more and more brilliant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;So after college students enter university, the first thing is to understand their mission. Everyone should have their own arrangements and expectations. This is not just lip service, it is actually something that must be done. We all came slowly from undergraduate to master&#39;s and doctoral degrees. New students especially need to have a sense of mission and have expectations, prospects, and arrangements for the future. I think this is the most important thing. Time flies so fast. Even if you look at the four years of undergraduate studies, half of it has passed in the blink of an eye. However, the task is actually endless. We still need to continue to work hard, strive for, and develop in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;College students should not be afraid of being tired. Only by constantly exploring their own prospects can individuals have new goals, new directions, and continuous progress. Learn more every day, overcome your shortcomings, and show new expectations. This is my common expectation for our college students, whether they are undergraduates, masters, or doctoral students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 10:25:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“机场判官”再曝住宿骗局：虚假定位误导消费者]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261538]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;July 5, 2020, Xi&#39;an Xianyang International Airport.

In the video released on November 20, Liu Yi deliberately took the high-speed train from Beijing to Xi&#39;an in order to avoid leaking his itinerary, and then took a bus to Xi&#39;an Xianyang International Airport to &quot;patrol&quot;, which confirmed that the positioning of B&amp;Bs around the airport on the OTA platform was fraudulent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In this video, Liu Yi searched for the hotel with the closest straight line distance on a platform, and the first-ranked &quot;Jiaxuan Boutique B&amp;B&quot; was marked &quot;from Xianyang The international airport is 340 meters straight.&quot; In fact, the passenger arrived at the online car-hailing parking lot, which is the hotel pick-up location. Then he searched on another platform, and multiple Huangzhixiang Hotel branches appeared on the page, one of which was &quot;119 meters &quot;Straight-line distance from Xi&#39;an Xianyang International Airport&quot;, but when I called, the other party told me that the hotel is behind the terminal and that I need to wait for the car to pick me up. Finally, the Shitouji Inn, which was &quot;&lt;100 meters away from you in a straight line&quot; on the third platform, was also falsely positioned. . Liu Yi believes that these B&amp;Bs are engaging in fraud on the OTA platform and are operating in bad faith. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 20, 2023, Liu Yi used the online travel hotel platform to search for nearby accommodation at Xi&#39;an Xianyang International Airport.

Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Under the video posted by Liu Yi, many netizens provided screenshots of the above-mentioned negative reviews of the falsely positioned hotel: &quot;Didn&#39;t pay attention to the words above The straight-line distance is too deceptive. The hotel is actually more than 8 kilometers away from the airport. It is said to be an inn, but it is actually a room owned by farmers near the airport, and the sanitary rooms are extremely poor.&quot; Some netizens said that there are already tourists on the online platform Comments mentioned issues such as long distances and fake room pictures, but this type of B&amp;B still ranks high on the platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Yi discovered that the above-mentioned B&amp;Bs were falsely positioned at the online car-hailing parking lot, T3 terminal, and T2 terminal of Xi&#39;an Airport. According to the information he collected, these B&amp;Bs are basically run by villagers from Bianfang Village and Shitou Village near the airport. Because they are close to the airport, these villages have developed a transit accommodation industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 22, Southern Weekend reporters searched on Ctrip, Tongcheng, Fliggy and other platforms, and only &quot;near Xi&#39;an Xianyang International&quot; was displayed in the hotel list. Airport&quot; but does not show the specific distance. Then type in the search for the three falsely positioned B&amp;Bs mentioned in Liu Yi&#39;s video. The Ctrip platform has removed all three stores; however, some platforms can still search for Jiaxuan Boutique Apartment, which shows that it is sold out and cannot be pre-ordered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The address page of Fliggy Search Jiaxuan Business Hotel is still marked &quot;About 300 meters west of Terminal T2 of Xi&#39;an Xianyang International Airport&quot;. When a Southern Weekend reporter called as a customer to ask if the hotel was within the terminal, the staff told her that it was a 3-minute drive outside the terminal and that there would be someone to pick her up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Yi said that these falsely positioned B&amp;Bs not only appear on the above-mentioned platforms, but also exist on other platforms. On another OTA platform, a store that was marked on the 20th as &quot;less than 100 meters away from Xi&#39;an Xianyang International Airport in a straight line, about a 1-minute walk&quot; was modified on the 22nd to &quot;4.5 kilometers from Xi&#39;an Xianyang International Airport by car, about 9 minutes.&quot; When a reporter from Southern Weekend asked why it was only a one-minute walk away, the store owner did not reply directly, but emphasized that &quot;I am outside the airport, and there is no way it is as cheap as ours inside the airport.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 22, Southern Weekend reporters contacted four OTA platforms, Ctrip, Tongcheng, Fliggy and Meituan, but received no reply. An industry insider on the OTA platform who did not want to be named analyzed that the platform needs to verify the address of the hotel before it goes online, and also conducts daily verification and inspections after going online. The current listings with false addresses should be due to the operators providing fake business operations. For example, the address on the license or lease contract is the same as the online address, so it is difficult for the platform to identify it. At the same time, various online travel and hotel platforms still have some agent listings, and some listings are closed on one platform and re-listed on other platforms. &quot;If the platform does not effectively intercept, it will be difficult to investigate and deal with it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The person in charge of the above-mentioned Airport New City told Southern Weekend reporters that the local market supervision department has interviewed three OTA platforms in the past two days and ordered them to strengthen the management of homestays around the airport. Information review. Offline, the joint law enforcement team they formed also conducted focused investigations on several issues mentioned by the blogger, including whether the names on the special industry license, business license, and door plaque were consistent, and whether the pictures on the platform were consistent with the actual situation. etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Dilemma of Passengers’ Rights Protection&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A few days after Liu Yi released the video, netizens left messages one after another, talking about their travels in Xiamen, Kunming, Dali, Airports in Shanghai and other places have also encountered similar problems, but not many people choose to be tough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Netizen Zhang Ning landed at Fuzhou Airport on September 4. At that time, he chose a platform to introduce a hotel only 200 meters away from the airport. The picture looked clean and spacious. The result The man who picked her up drove her for more than ten minutes and took her to a self-built building, saying that this was a hotel. Zhang Ning reasoned with the hotel receptionist about why the hotel location and photos were different from those on the platform. The other party said, &quot;That&#39;s an old hotel and it&#39;s closed.&quot; He didn&#39;t provide a specific address and asked her to get there and take a taxi. It was already late at night, so Zhang Ning could only stay after repeated considerations, and asked the airport pick-up staff to take her back to the airport the next day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Originally I wanted to give a negative review, but because he has my personal information, I didn&#39;t dare to give it.&quot; Zhang Ning said that she was worried about being retaliated against, and she didn&#39;t want to give it to herself. create unnecessary trouble during the journey. A few months after the incident, Zhang Ning recorded the incident in Liu Yi&#39;s video comment area, &quot;I hope more people will see these issues and support him in safeguarding his rights.&quot; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the video recorded by Liu Yi, his process of exposing the accommodation scam was also quite tortuous. On September 12, Liu Yi, as a flight blogger, went to Xi&#39;an Airport to experience transit accommodation for the first time. Unexpectedly, the &quot;scammer&quot; directly solicited customers at the airport gate, posing as a hotel staff with free transit accommodation, and wanted to take him to a paid hotel. Liu Yi simply recorded the video and exposed it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Previously, Liu Yi reported that Xi&#39;an Airport&#39;s transit accommodation was being solicited by &quot;Li Gui&quot;, and the airport promised to continue to improve the passenger experience.

Visual China Map&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 20, the Shaanxi Airport Public Security Bureau stated that it had stepped up inspection and control efforts and severely cracked down on illegal activities such as pretending to be staff to solicit passengers for transportation and accommodation. For disorderly conduct, 148 people have been punished since September and 3 people were detained administratively. But soon, when Liu Yi arrived at Xi&#39;an Airport again, the scammer only moved from Gate 324 to Gate 322 of the airport, and the security guards did not effectively intercept him. During this period, Liu Yi began to receive various complaints and threats in private messages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When Liu Yi landed at Xi&#39;an Airport for the third time, the security guard&#39;s attention became Liu Yi himself. Liu Yi mentioned that the security guard went to him when he passed by. The intercom shouted &quot;He&#39;s passed.&quot; During that trip, some netizens informed Liu Yi that her trip information had been leaked. According to screenshots provided by netizens, Liu Yi checked in at Shenzhen to fly to Xi&#39;an on October 24. At 18:42, a message appeared in the black car group at Xi&#39;an Airport that Liu Yi was about to go to Xi&#39;an, reminding everyone to be careful. For this reason, Liu Yi had to call the police. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the following video, he said that he would buy 15 air tickets, fly from Shenzhen to Xi&#39;an once a week, and inspect the airport for improvements. He believes that compared to ordinary passengers, as a flight blogger, he can enjoy free tickets and discounts from many airlines, which provides a basis for rights protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But Liu Yi said that the follow-up handling of his personal information leakage case was not satisfactory. The police found the security guard who spread the information, but were unable to find out who leaked it. He also understands this. The chain involved in the leakage of passengers&#39; personal information is too long and difficult to trace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporters contacted the Airport Police Bureau of the Shaanxi Provincial Public Security Department several times but failed to get through. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Yi&#39;s courage to defend his rights has aroused the sympathy of many fans. Liu Yi said that the content he received most in the backend was from netizens from all over the world asking for help, including those whose mobile phones were stolen at the airport, those who were deceived into staying in hotels, etc. &quot;Most of them I can only comfort.&quot; The communication between Liu Yi and the relevant departments of the airport has always been &quot;dialogue over the air.&quot; Liu Yi said that the airport management department contacted him after posting the relevant video for the second time and expressed the hope that he could come to Xi&#39;an to communicate in person. Liu Yi felt that it was inappropriate. Conveniently, I declined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The person in charge of the above-mentioned Airport New City Management Committee stated that Xi&#39;an Xianyang International Airport, Xixian New District Airport New City, and the Airport Public Security Bureau of the Shaanxi Provincial Public Security Department have launched a A comprehensive management office was set up in Japan to rectify the behavior of soliciting passengers in the airport terminal. At present, this problem has been basically solved. They got in further contact with Liu Yi on November 23 and will continue to make improvements based on the issues he reported. &quot;Having such enthusiastic bloggers point out some problems in development to us, and if we correct them, I think it will also help progress.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023 November On March 24, Liu Yi once again updated the Xi&#39;an Airport series of videos. He asked fans to experience the B&amp;Bs around Xi&#39;an Airport, pointing out that these B&amp;Bs still have problems such as photos that are different from the actual situation and store signs that are inconsistent. &quot;Next, I want to see how this rectification (referring to the joint rectification action by the local regulatory authorities on the 23rd) will be.&quot; It won’t bring good results.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Liu Yi and Zhang Ning are pseudonyms in the article)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 09:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[任伯年和他的公孙大娘]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261260]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 08:37:31&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/22/2dJwOHFCf1QgUgg5MyRO7rgRrqXLoLotXOVfkc18.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/2dJwOHFCf1QgUgg5MyRO7rgRrqXLoLotXOVf kc18. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259265&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Xu Wei Art Museum, Shaoxing, Zhejiang, &quot;The Impermanence of the Pen, the Elegance and the Richness&quot; by Ren Bonian Painting exhibition site&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The total length is nearly 13 meters and it is opened for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the first time that Xu Wei&#39;s &quot;Flowers of the Four Seasons&quot; collected by the Palace Museum has left the palace.

Prior to this, due to the limitations of the exhibition space, this long scroll had never been completely opened. Visitors to the exhibition could only see part of it. Even in the album, it could only be broken down piece by piece. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Flowers in the four seasons have never been in full bloom at the same time.

The self -conscious poetry of the tail is older: &quot;The old man&#39;s game ink is dripping, the flowers and plants will be miscellaneous. Long, it was officially put into use in 2021, and at the time was still during the new crown epidemic. Since the opening of the museum, there are only three large -scale exhibitions, but the venue &quot;has no virtuality&quot;. It is Ren Bonian&#39;s special session, and every game is worthy of a special rush. The 13 -meter &quot;Four -time Flower Picture Volume&quot; comes from Ren Bo Nian. Although Xu Wei and his little fellow Ren Bonian, the time difference is more than 300 years, the intersection and cultural transmission in space can be called the ink and ink division in the broad sense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/hpxews9c11gqigdcrexnx4qprgcowimb.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot;720&quot; height = &quot;960&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/hpxew9c11gqigdcrexnx4qprgcowimb.jpg&quot; data- &quot;>; &lt;259263&quot;>; &lt;/p. >; &lt;p style = &quot;coloror : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>; Zhong Yan in Ren Bonian &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The painter Ren Bonian in the late Qing Dynasty, is the best in the&quot; Maritime Painting School &quot;and&quot; Four Appointments &quot;, especially the characters See you long. When Ren Bo was young, he operated a rice shop in his family, but his father painted well and taught him in his spare time. It is said that Ren Bo Nian was able to paint his character very early. It was said that someone came to his father, and his father was not there. When he came back, he heard that who Ren Bonian came. He was only ten years old at the time. In appearance, my father knew at a glance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When Ren Bo was 22 years old, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom broke through Shaoxing. His father was killed. Ren Bonian was also involved in the war and paid the banner for the Taiping Army.

These are the common themes in Ren Bo Nian. He is a character he repeatedly described. The Zhong Rong he painted is particularly chic, high -vision, but it looks like an unruly. Whenever these new works are made in these strange works, you can see the painter&#39;s true temperament and humor.

Since then, Pinduoduo’s transaction service fee income has increased significantly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Lei commented at the 2020 third quarter earnings conference call that Duoduo’s grocery shopping business is “a platform that consumers use very frequently.” Entering the fourth quarter of 2020, Pinduoduo’s number of active buyers surpassed Alibaba for the first time, reaching 788 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since its establishment, Duoduomaicai has gone through many rounds of fierce battles between platforms and has survived the dark moment of community group buying. According to reports from many media including Qilu Evening News, nine provinces have been shut down in order to target the prosperity of the sinking market. Jingxi Pinpin is only left in Langfang, Hebei and Beijing. Other community group buying has also been shut down one after another. Currently, Pinduoduo and Meituan Each controls half of the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of 2023, the US asset management company HAYDEN CAPITAL estimated that by 2025, Duoduo Maicai will contribute at least about 14 billion yuan in EBIT to Pinduoduo, which may start in 2023 Achieve overall profitability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this financial performance meeting, Chen Lei introduced that Pinduoduo started out in agricultural products and retained a number of users through agricultural products services. However, the current online rate of this category is low, and there is huge potential in the future. potential. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to Duoduo’s grocery shopping, the market generally speculates that Duoduo’s cross-border services may create a new revenue growth curve for Pinduoduo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2022, Pinduoduo launched the cross-border e-commerce project Temu, which Chen Lei regarded as his &quot;third venture.&quot; At that time, Pinduoduo’s vice president of finance, Liu Jun, said that cross-border business was in its early stages and would have little impact on financial reports. Temu’s revenue data was not announced in this financial report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Duoduo’s cross-border project is led by Gu Pingping, the former head of Duoduo’s grocery shopping, and inherits Pinduoduo’s domestic supply, talent, and marketing advantages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this financial report meeting, Liu Jun said, &quot;Pinduoduo&#39;s global business is still in a very early stage, and the team is still increasing its understanding of consumer needs in different markets around the world.&quot; Currently, Temu has launched a In 2016, it has expanded to 40 countries and regions around the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Getting out of the quagmire of losses&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On November 28, in contrast to the upward trend in Pinduoduo’s stock price, the stock price of Alibaba (BABA.NYSE) dropped all the way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consumption downgrading is an increasingly clear trend. Consumers are moving from platforms with high unit prices to low-price platforms. Low price is still the key for Pinduoduo to occupy the sinking market in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back at Pinduoduo’s growth history, the “10 billion subsidy” strategy has not only opened up the market for it, but is also the main reason for dragging down its financial performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pinduoduo has faced significant losses since its listing. From 2018 to the first quarter of 2020, losses continued to expand. In June 2019, after the &quot;Ten Billion Subsidy&quot; was launched, it achieved GMV growth and increased user activity. The price was that its sales and marketing expenses exceeded profits, which was equivalent to all the revenue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Entering the second quarter of 2020, Pinduoduo’s losses have narrowed. Ma Jing, Pinduoduo’s vice president of finance at the time, said at the earnings conference call, “Profitability will not be considered this year.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was not until the third quarter of 2020 that Pinduoduo achieved profitability for the first time, which was also when CEO Chen Lei took office. The first report card after. This year, Pinduoduo launched Duoduo’s grocery shopping business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pinduoduo really &quot;taken off&quot; in the second quarter of 2021, with both revenue and profit increasing, and getting out of the mire of losses. Since then, it has almost maintained a double-digit profit growth. In particular, three quarters in 2022 will achieve multiple growth, with profits in the second quarter nearly tripling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Jing responded at the second quarter 2021 conference call that revenue growth stems from the increase in the number of users and the increase in user psychological share, and the second quarter is the off-season for marketing, so marketing expenditures are small and there are seasonal factors. Special reasons for sex. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Pinduoduo executives also made no secret of the fact that the increase in profits comes from cost reduction and efficiency increase during the 2021 financial results conference call. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huang Lichong said that over the years, Pinduoduo has optimized its operating costs, reduced some unnecessary expenses, increased profit margins by increasing product prices and reducing after-sales service costs, while investing in technology, logistics, agriculture and other fields. , improve its own competitiveness and business efficiency. These strategies have effectively helped it get out of losses and achieve profits beyond expectations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pinduoduo’s executive director and co-CEO Zhao Jiazhen revealed in a recent earnings conference call that during the just past “Double Eleven” promotion, the number of users of Pinduoduo’s “10 billion subsidy” has exceeded 620 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the first trading day after the financial report was released, employees on Alibaba’s intranet discussed Pinduoduo’s performance in the capital market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alibaba partner Jack Ma rarely replied, &quot;All great companies are born in winter. The era of AI e-commerce has just begun, and it is both an opportunity and a challenge for everyone. I would like to congratulate Pinduoduo for the past few years. Decision-making, execution and efforts. No one is better, but those who can reform for the sake of tomorrow and the organization that are willing to pay any price and sacrifice are respected.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/ p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[戏骨云集的《风声》姐妹篇，砸了]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261518]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-29 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;The new theatrical film &quot;The Point of the Knife&quot; is the latest version of &quot;The Wind&quot; &quot;Sister volume of &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is also an original work by Mai Jia + director Gao Qunshu, with a spy war theme + a bone drama, but the reputation is far different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/5e5887f258139695a465a4e2e7c48738.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1511&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/5e5887f258139695a465a4e2e7c48738.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259921&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Today, 14 years after its release, &quot;The Wind&quot; is still the leading Chinese-language spy suspense film. 600,000 people gave it a high score of 8.4 on Douban, which is better than 95% of dramas and 98% of thrillers.

However, &quot;The Point of the Knife&quot; revealed the truth to the audience from the very beginning. The identities of Jin Shenshui and Lin Yingying were two bright cards that were played too early, and there was no suspense left.

But unfortunately, since the victory of the Lu faction and the end of the internal fighting, the film has fallen into piecemeal chaos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first hour and the last hour of &quot;The Point of the Knife&quot; are as separate as if they were not the same movie.

However, using dubbing to promote narrative in film and television works is undoubtedly a very weak choice. On the contrary, it proves that the film is unable to tell stories with pictures and characters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/fc6639ab4d254361f39ebce1ee21cfb8.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;405&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/fc6639ab4d254361f39ebce1ee21cfb8.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259926&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Although there are many characters appearing in the first half, they still have distinct personalities. But the characters who appear in the second half, such as the members of the military command team stationed in Nanjing, Lin Yingying&#39;s relatives, etc., these supporting roles are too homogeneous. In fact, there is no need to type subtitles for every person who appears, nor do you need to give everyone equal time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Such a passing character and hasty explanation of the ending give the second half a sense of deja vu, as if you have finished the plot and left work early, and the narrative is cohesive&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; span>;Compared with the first half, it can be regarded as loose prose. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To use a common saying to describe the impression of &quot;The Point of the Knife&quot;, it is that &quot;it is full of energy, then fades, and three times it is exhausted.&quot; The more you watch, the more discouraged you are, until it collapses thousands of miles. The film wants to portray the change of mentality of the triple agent. It stands to reason that the character will be highlighted and sublimated at the end, but this mechanism obviously fails in this film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/88632c0053d9c80d3cbd10e11477fa59.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/88632c0053d9c80d3cbd10e11477fa59.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259931&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;The Edge of the Knife&quot; is not as good as &quot;The Wind&quot;, which has a lot to do with the tendency of film and television adaptation. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;The original work of &quot;The Sound of the Wind&quot; is divided into Dongfeng, West Wind and Jingfeng. From the perspectives of different narrators, it restores the ghost-catching past events in Qiuzhuang with different versions that are difficult to distinguish between true and false. If it were shot strictly according to the logic of the original work, it would be a polished remake of &quot;Rashomon.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;But the director accurately picked out the main line of the story, filled it with flesh and blood, and drastically deleted unnecessary plots. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The film version of &quot;The Wind&quot; is a bit like a colorful stage play, and it does use the three principles of drama&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; (observe time , location and actions are consistent)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;——The isolated Qiuzhuang is an excellent stage for the story to be staged.

For commercial banks, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the &quot;Green Finance Evaluation Plan for Banking Financial Institutions&quot;, Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center will include green loan balance, growth rate, proportion, total issuance amount of green bonds, and underwriting scale into the banks in the 2023 Green Finance List List evaluation indicators. The total weight of the five third-level indicators in this dimension is 16%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;(2) Environmental contribution. Environmental contribution refers to the actual contribution and performance of financial institutions in environmental protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the one hand, in order to promote the realization of the &quot;double carbon&quot; goal, various financial institutions have actively established green and low-carbon operating systems, formulated carbon emission targets for the future period, and established The carbon emission statistics platform calculates its own greenhouse gas emissions and per capita greenhouse gas emissions, analyzes its own carbon emission potential, and provides data support for low-carbon operation management. On the other hand, various financial institutions have established the concept of &quot;green operation office&quot; to reduce the impact of operating activities on the environment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center combines publicly disclosed information and uses greenhouse gas emissions and per capita greenhouse gas emissions to examine the green and low-carbon operating systems of various financial institutions. Per capita energy consumption and per capita water consumption are used to measure the performance of each financial institution in green operations. Overall, the higher the environmental contribution of a financial institution, the better its green and low-carbon operations are, the less damage it causes to the environment, and the higher its carbon neutrality efficiency and energy utilization efficiency. The total weight of the four third-level indicators in this dimension is 8%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;(3) Social responsibility. Social responsibility refers to the performance of social responsibilities of financial institutions, social evaluation, and employee development and protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This indicator includes four levels: First, it refers to financial institutions adhering to the original intention of serving financial entities, actively serving the country&#39;s major strategic deployments, and guiding the flow of financial resources to national priorities.

The weight of relevant indicators is 4%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;To sum up, the four second-level indicators under this dimension include a total of 13 third-level indicators, with a total weight of 36%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;(4) ESG governance. ESG governance here refers to whether financial institutions have established organizational structures and performance assessments that are compatible with green finance, environmental contribution and social responsibility. ESG performance is an important consideration for financial companies&#39; sustainable development capabilities, and ESG concepts have become an important concept for investors&#39; investment decisions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;More and more financial institutions have established ESG governance structures, set up specialized departments or offices to take charge of green finance and other work, and incorporated ESG-related indicators into their performance appraisal systems to Motivate employees to achieve better green financial performance. At the same time, listed companies are subject to ESG ratings by major rating agencies. This list uses MSCI rating results to measure the ESG governance performance of each financial institution, comprehensively reflecting the ESG performance of each financial institution in authoritative rating agencies.

For example, at the end of June 2023, the balance of ICBC&#39;s green loans reached 5 trillion yuan, accounting for more than 30% of the bank&#39;s total loans; state-owned banks are also at the forefront of the total green bond issuance and green bond underwriting amount indicators. For example, by the end of 2022, Bank of China’s green bond issuance amounted to 87.7 billion yuan, and its green bond underwriting amount was 453.9 billion yuan, ranking first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In terms of ESG governance, the six major banks have all set up organizational structures and performance appraisal systems that are compatible with green finance. The latest ESG rating results announced by MSCI also All were A-level and received full marks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the field of social responsibility, the six major banks all performed well in aspects such as aging-friendly services, issuance and promotion of electronic social security cards and electronic medical insurance vouchers, and received full marks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The difference is that the balance and proportion of ICBC green loans, the balance and proportion of agriculture-related loans, and the balance and proportion of manufacturing loans are The indicators ranked first among the four major banks. Although its total greenhouse gas emissions and per capita energy consumption are higher than the other three major banks in terms of environmental contribution, its overall ranking is still first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Agricultural Bank of China’s green loan balance and manufacturing loan balance are second only to ICBC, but the growth rate of green loan balance is the fastest among the four major banks; at the same time, The bank&#39;s county-level green loan balance and proportion rank first among its peers. As of the end of June 2023, the bank&#39;s cumulative scale of carbon emission reduction loans issued and the reduction of carbon emissions it has driven are among the best among its peers. Although the overall score of Agricultural Bank of China is 5.25 points lower than that of ICBC, it is significantly ahead of the other two major state-owned banks, seizing the &quot;second spot&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Joint-stock banks: Xingye stands out&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Overall, joint-stock companies The green loan balance of banks is weaker than that of state-owned banks, and the average proportion of green loan balance is about 11%, which is far smaller than the 18% average of large state-owned banks. This shows that joint-stock banks are weak in green loans to support the development of green industries. At the same time, joint-stock banks rarely issue green bonds, and the average size of green bond underwriting is only about 1/10 of large state-owned banks, which also shows that joint-stock banks are weak in green financial products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But there are not no benchmarks among joint-stock banks. Industrial Bank performs well in indicators such as green loan balance, agriculture-related loan balance, manufacturing loan balance, and inclusive small and micro enterprise loan balance, all ranking among joint-stock banks. In Mingsheng ESG Ratings, Industrial Bank also ranks with the four Major banks also received an A grade. At the same time, Industrial Bank&#39;s competitiveness in the field of green finance has also been recognized by most review experts, and its number of votes in the field of green finance tied for first place with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Therefore, Industrial Bank’s comprehensive score beat all banks, beating Bank of China with an advantage of 3.32 points, and was rated as the &quot;Green Finance Ranking of the Banking Industry&quot;.

Despite obvious disadvantages in terms of size and scale, Bank of Nanjing not only ranks first among city commercial banks in comprehensive scores by virtue of its share of indicators in terms of green loan balance, agriculture-related loan balance, and inclusive small and micro loan balance. The score even exceeds that of major state-owned banks and leading joint-stock banks that far exceed its own scale. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Serving the real economy&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;:&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;State-owned banks&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;do their best&lt; /strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Overall, state-owned banks are members of the first echelon of social responsibilities, and the second and third echelons are joint-stock banks and city banks. commercial Bank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When examining the services of commercial banks to the real economy, Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center chose to measure the services of commercial banks to manufacturing loans and inclusive small and micro enterprise loans.

At these two levels, state-owned banks performed relatively well in terms of loan balance, growth rate and proportion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Joint-stock banks perform well in pension finance and employee human capital development.

As a benchmark, nine life insurance companies were evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively from the four dimensions of economic performance, environmental performance, social performance and corporate governance, and fourteen sub-indicators were set, and different weights were given to each sub-indicator according to the difference in importance. The total weight of the above indicators accounts for 70%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the same time, the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center comprehensively rated nine life insurance companies from the two dimensions of expert review and media factors (each accounting for 15% weight) , to build a green finance list for the insurance industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Green Finance List Life Insurance List Indicator System (Liang Shuyi, Liu Yuyu/Photo)&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11 /29/086e8a479b.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;2086&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/086e8a479b.png &quot; data-key=&quot;259952&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Green Finance List Life Insurance List Indicator System (Liang Shuyi, Liu Yuyu/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The quantitative and qualitative indicators of the life insurance ranking index system are explained as follows:&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the economic performance dimension, based on the scale of green investment , operating profit is measured by two third-level indicators. Green investment refers to investing in green industries or conducting green business activities, such as purchasing green bonds, green index funds, etc.; operating profit is used to measure a company&#39;s operating performance. In theory, it should be measured by green investment business income generation indicators. Taking into account actual information disclosure, operating profit replace. The total weight of the above two indicators is 10%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the environmental performance dimension, total greenhouse gas emissions and per capita values ​​are core indicators, echoing the &quot;3060&quot; dual carbon goals. Taking into account the service industry characteristics of the financial industry, natural resources and energy consumption are measured in terms of electricity, water, gas and oil consumption. The total weight of the above five indicators is 25%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The social performance dimension mainly sets three three-level indicators from the three perspectives of consumers, employees and communities: consumer complaint volume, employee turnover rate and charity investment measure. The total weight of the above indicators is 15%. Stakeholders such as governments and partners are not included because the information disclosure standards of each ESG report are different and comparability is poor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Corporate governance dimension, set the number of core issues, MSCI rating, scope&lt;strong>;three&lt;/strong>; data disclosure, ESG reporting third party There are 4 third-level indicators of certification status. The total weight of the above four indicators is 20%. Among them, carbon emission scope three data is an important part of carbon emission accounting at the organizational level, including greenhouse gas emissions from upstream and downstream (value chain) activities related to corporate production. For service industries such as finance, business travel and employee commuting are the main components of Scope 3. However, due to greater accounting difficulties in this part, fewer life insurance companies proactively disclose it. In addition, although the insurance industry has paid more attention to ESG reporting, most ESG reports have not obtained third-party certification, so their objectivity and independence are questionable. Based on the above reasons and from the perspective of encouraging standardized information disclosure, corporate governance dimension indicators are set in a qualitative manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Life insurance list: Ping An Life takes the lead&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Life insurance According to the green finance list of industrial financial institutions, Ping An Life, PICC Life and Sunshine Life ranked among the top three in total. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From the perspective of quantitative and qualitative indicators, Ping An Life, PICC Life and AIA Life are leading, but PICC Life and AIA Life failed to provide any supplementary information in time during the survey. , so the media factor score is 0, which drags down the total score and ranking.

The former refers to the fact that Hengdian Film and Television Base is now dominated by the &quot;vertical screen short drama&quot; shooting team; the latter refers to the short drama application platform ReelShort, which has begun to conquer overseas markets and even topped the U.S. iOS entertainment list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 22, the &quot;2023-2024 China Micro-Short Drama Market Research Report&quot; released by iiMedia Consulting showed that China&#39;s online short drama market size will be 37.39 billion yuan in 2023, a year-on-year increase of 267.65%. A total of 481 new short dramas were released in the first half of 2023, exceeding the level for the whole of 2022.

For example, in September 2023, the traffic miracle of &quot;Wushuang&quot; exceeded 100 million in revenue in 8 days, which caused a sensation. , the myth of getting rich &quot;completed in one week, released in one month, and achieving financial freedom&quot; is also widely circulated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The success of short plays is rooted in human nature, which is a deep need that people cannot erase. Human nature naturally loves &quot;refreshment&quot;, &quot;hate&quot; and &quot;relief&quot;, seeks emotional catharsis, and longs for emotional compensation. While the audience scolded the stereotyped short drama, they still couldn&#39;t help but finish watching a short drama with dozens of episodes before going to bed and experiencing the excitement of &quot;it turns out that success and love can come so quickly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Short plays can often satisfy people&#39;s certain &quot;feelings&quot; and &quot;hit&quot; the inherent pleasure mechanism of human nature. Themes such as &quot;Grand grudges between wealthy families&quot;, &quot;Marriage first, love later&quot; and &quot;The domineering president fell in love with me&quot; are everlasting. Revenge, counterattack, the boss&#39;s sweet pet, a golden son-in-law, marrying into a wealthy family... Such plots are also repeated many times. Can&#39;t get tired of watching it. The protagonist of the short drama has either become an alternative Count of Monte Cristo, or a film and television version of &quot;Long Aotian&quot; or &quot;Mary Sue&quot;, or it seems to be the product of pressing shortcut keys on a long and drawn-out urban emotional drama. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Slightly different from the previous Internet ecology, the current industry supervision has become more and more synchronized, which is a new situation worthy of attention. The recent news that &quot;Tik Tok, Kuaishou, and WeChat platforms are jointly cracking down on illegal short dramas&quot; is also consistent with the fact that the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television has &quot;already removed 25,000 short dramas from the shelves. The next step will be to launch a one-month special rectification work on online short dramas.&quot; ” echoed the announcement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that the Internet industry has indeed been &quot;leading the way for three to five years.&quot; Past success may not be maintained for a long time in the face of new trends. The rise of short dramas with the help of short videos fully illustrates this point. At the same time, the &quot;reckless state&quot; of the Internet industry&#39;s barbaric growth and turf racing has passed, and the advancement of technology and industry and the follow-up of regulatory regulations are increasingly showing a &quot;same frequency&quot; state. In compliance with regulatory requirements, the pursuit of high-quality and high-quality content will still be the main focus of the short drama market in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[七百岁村庙的“一生”：东南最早元代建筑被发现]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261520]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-29 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/11/29/9cbb99999f.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;706&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/ 29/9cbb99999f.png&quot; data-key=&quot;259937&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Overlooking Fook Sin Hall. Photographed by “Anonymous”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since I first saw Fook Sin Tong in 2017, I have never forgotten it. &quot;No name for now&quot; is his online name, and acquaintances call him &quot;No name for now.&quot; Even if the discovery of a Yuan Dynasty wooden building in the south was enough for him to leave his name in the history of architecture, he decided not to leave his name for the time being. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Walk around the mountains and rivers of Fujian for a while, just like visiting old friends, to look for the historical buildings hidden deep in the ancient villages and scattered along the ancient roads. His &quot;discovery&quot; of Fu Shan Tang was accidental, or it might be inevitable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Fushan Hall is located in Zhengwei Village, Dikou Town, Jianou City, Fujian Province. It is a group of vernacular temple buildings, which conforms to the usual orientation rules of Chinese architecture: &quot;sitting Different from &quot;north to south&quot;, Fushan Hall conforms to the mountainous terrain of Zhengwei Village and faces south as a whole. The main hall is dedicated to the Three Treasures, and the left and right side halls are dedicated to Guanyin and King Dongping. It is a blend of Buddhism, Taoism and folk beliefs that are common in village temples. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The main hall faces a Qing Dynasty stage across the courtyard, and is integrated with the main hall through the corridor. Before the main hall was confirmed as a Yuan structure, the stage was the narrative center of the entire building complex. When people in the village talked about Fu Shan Tang, they would always talk about the story of the stage, but they were completely unaware of the main hall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The &quot;discovery&quot; of Fu Shan Tang was not to find the existence of this building, but to confirm its identity as being built in the Yuan Dynasty. This time is July 18, 2023. That day, Liu Yan witnessed a &quot;highlight moment&quot; that has yet to come. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Yanhe has traveled almost all over the landscapes of southern Zhejiang and northern Fujian for more than ten years. He studies woven wooden arcade bridges. An amazing bridge structure unique to the Fujian and Zhejiang mountains. The same interests led him to meet each other very early on, and they have been online friends for seven or eight years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhengweicun not only has Fushan Hall, but also has two covered bridges from the Qing Dynasty. In July 2023, Liu Yan took graduate students to survey and map in Zhengweicun Covered Bridge, I didn’t hear that they were in Fujian yet, so I drove here from Fuzhou, holding a newly purchased infrared camera in my hand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Hundreds of years of burning paper and smoke, the beams of the main hall of Fu Shan Tang have been smoked black by the incense of believers. The inscriptions written by the ancients on the beams It is impossible to find it and can only be roughly dated based on its style. Using an infrared camera, it is possible to see traces of writing beneath the smoke. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/5e9396e852.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1272&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/5e9396e852.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259938&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In October 2023, instead of standing on the ladder, use an extended pole to connect the shooting instrument to observe the details of the components on the beams of Fushan Hall. Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Wang Huazhen&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to preliminary observations, the main structure of Fushantang Hall is relatively complete, with shuttle columns, column foundations, humps, and replacement wood etc. The obvious early features, such as the planar column network and frame beams, are quite similar to the main hall of Shunchang Baoshan Temple built in the 23rd year of Yuan Zhizheng (1363) with a stone imitation wood structure. Through rough dating of style, it is not possible to judge that the structure of Fushan Hall is no later than the early Ming Dynasty, and may even be in the Yuan Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On that day, Liu Yan was not taken into Fushan Hall for the time being. While Liu Yan was still looking at the entire courtyard with unfamiliar eyes, he had already gone straight to the point and raised his infrared camera to identify the ink characters on Zhengliang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At first, Liu Yan didn&#39;t know what he saw through the infrared camera, because his expression didn&#39;t change much. He just raised his head to take a picture, and then lowered his head to confirm... Suddenly, he stopped getting excited. He held his breath, got excited, calmed down again, quickly checked on his mobile phone, and cautiously confirmed again. He no longer suppressed the ecstasy in his heart: &quot;Yuan Dynasty! The greatest!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The inscription on the main beam shown in the infrared camera clearly reads: &quot;On the ninth day of the eighth month of Wushen, the first year of Wei Zhi&#39;s reign, Yiwei came to Fucheng... Congratulations for the reconstruction of the city...&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 25, 2023, the UNESCO Representative Office in China and relevant government agencies of Fujian Province and Quanzhou City hosted the &quot;East Asian Wood Structure Building Protection and &quot;Utilizing International Academic Exchange Conference&quot;, at which Lou Jianlong, deputy director of Fujian Museum, gave a speech entitled &quot;Early Architecture and Characteristics of Fujian&quot;. During his speech, Lou Jianlong mentioned Fu Shan Tang. This may be the first time that Fu Shan Tang has been officially recognized as a newly discovered Yuan Dynasty building and mentioned at an international conference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The existing main structure of Fushan Hall was founded in the first year of the Great Rebellion, that is, 1307. Before it, the earliest known Yuan Dynasty wooden structure in southeastern China was the Yanfu Temple in Wuyi, Zhejiang, built in 1317, the fourth year of Yanyou in the Yuan Dynasty. The newly confirmed Fushan Hall in Zhengwei Village has now become the earliest Yuan structure in the southeast. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Cheng - the &quot;hedge&quot; of two time differences&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhengwei Village, where Fushan Hall is located, is located among the mountains in northern Fujian middle. The ancestor of the Zheng family who came to the village was Zheng Hao from the Song Dynasty. Zheng Fawang, secretary of the village branch, took out a photocopy of the &quot;Genealogy of the Zheng Family&quot; compiled during the Wanli Period of the Ming Dynasty, which recorded the story of the Zheng family&#39;s entry into Fujian and their reproduction in Jianzhou. The first ancestor of this Zheng family to migrate to Fujian was Zheng Shu during the Five Dynasties period. By Zheng Hao, it was already the eighth generation. According to the genealogy, Zheng Hao decided to move here after taking a fancy to the Feng Shui of Zhengwei Village. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Walking around the village, even a person who doesn&#39;t understand Feng Shui can easily see that the terrain of this village is indeed a bit special. Surrounded by two mountains like an armchair, the village &quot;sits&quot; safely in the mountain col between the two armrests. The opening of the armchair faces north, and a small stream flows through the entrance of the village, blocking the village in the mountain col. Fu Shan Tang is located in the west of the village - at the foot of the west armrest of the &quot;armchair&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/fdd66b33c4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/fdd66b33c4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259939&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Looking northeast from Fushan Hall, Zhengwei Village has a panoramic view. Under the setting sun, the rammed earth walls of folk houses in northern Fujian turn golden. Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Wang Huazhen&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although the old people in the village do not understand architecture, they have passed down from generation to generation that Fushan Hall was built by a man named Zhang Fushan in the Song Dynasty. Before Zheng came to the village, the main families in the village were Zhang and Wei. I don’t think this legend is likely to be an attachment, but Fushan Hall was probably built in the Song Dynasty, because the inscription mentions “reconstruction”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2021, Zhou Miao met Fu Shan Tang for the first time. He stayed there for a long time, &quot;it was really beyond imagination,&quot; he recalled his feelings at that time to the Southern Weekend reporter. He is a young teacher in the Department of Architecture of Zhejiang City University and is fond of ancient dwellings in northern Fujian and southern Zhejiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liang Sicheng, in &quot;The History of Chinese Architecture in Pictures&quot;, described the three periods of existing ancient architecture in China from the perspective of the history of artistic styles. The architecture of the Tang Dynasty was &quot;grand. &quot;Jing&quot; became &quot;mellow&quot; from the Song and Yuan Dynasties to the early Ming Dynasty, and &quot;straight&quot; during the Ming and Qing Dynasties. Zhou Miao&#39;s research focuses on the transformation of architecture in the Tang and Song Dynasties. When he saw Fushan Hall, his professional intuition told him that the combination of columns, beams, and brackets had a &quot;Song style&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In this era, to be able to find a metastructure in the humid south is a rare thing for any architectural scholar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the field of ancient architecture, there is a saying that &quot;Look to Shanxi in the north and Fujian in the south.&quot; The quantity, quality and density of preserved ancient buildings in these two provinces are far behind. more than other provinces. But Fujian is more unique than Shanxi. &quot;Shanxi is close to the Central Plains and the capitals of past dynasties, and the overall evolution of architecture has been relatively synchronized with the Central Plains dynasties. Maybe some styles have changed in the Central Plains, and Shanxi will also change in about 50 years.&quot; But Fujian is different, especially in the mountainous areas of northern Fujian and southern Zhejiang. , the development of architecture lags behind. If we see a style from the Song Dynasty there, it may be as late as the early Ming Dynasty. &quot;So when we see a house in Fujian with a fairly old style, we dare not make a judgment.&quot; Zhou Miao said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, Jian&#39;ou, located in the upper reaches of the Min River, is a mountainous area, but it was the first area in Fujian to be developed by Han immigrants. In 206 AD, the Sun Wu regime established Jian&#39;an County, the first county-level administrative region in Fujian history, in today&#39;s Jianou. Until the Song Dynasty, Jianzhou, centered on Jianou, was the cultural center of Fujian. At that time, Jianban books were popular all over the world, and Zhu Xi&#39;s Neo-Confucianism was also nurtured here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhou Miao later realized that although the mountainous areas of northern Fujian further north were developed very late, the narrow valley area in the upper reaches of the Min River was not too late. Specific to the style of architecture, there may also be a &quot;time difference&quot; between the Jian&#39;ou area and other northern Fujian areas. This time difference &quot;hedges&quot; the time difference between northern Fujian and the Central Plains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Weird power confuses the gods,&quot; Liu Yan said, pointing to the intricately carved cat beams and dou bao on the beams of Fushan Hall. Based on this intuition, he also boldly speculated that Fushan Hall was built in the Yuan Dynasty. &quot;It feels like it is earlier than the Ming Dynasty, but it is unlikely to be in the Song Dynasty. Because both the Song and Ming Dynasties tend to be orthodox and regular. Only the buildings of the Yuan Dynasty can have this kind of unconventional and unconventional style.&quot; Weird and weird approach.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/a94ef1b375.jpg&quot; border= &quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/a94ef1b375.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259940&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The beams of Fushan Hall are carved with complicated and strange cat beams and fighting arms. Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Wang Huazhen&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I will not write my discovery into a public account article for the time being. After posting it, I refused all media interviews, &quot; He feels that he has completed his historical mission,&quot; Liu Yan said. In October 2023, Liu Yan completed the surveying and mapping task of the covered bridge project. Before returning to his workplace, Kunming University of Science and Technology, he decided to go to Fushan Hall again to conduct the first surveying and mapping of it. &quot;Do you want to come? Maybe you will come for the time being. We may be able to persuade him to accept an interview.&quot; He asked the Southern Weekend reporter. At the end of October, Southern Weekend reporters met Fu Shan Tang and its discoverer, and also watched Liu Yan&#39;s team conduct a brief survey and mapping of Fu Shan Tang. What impressed me deeply was not only the building itself, but also the people who were bound by Fuk Sen Tang. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Living - &quot;Growth&quot; in the eyes of architectural archeology&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Witnessing the discovery of Fushantang with her own eyes made Liu Yan feel that there was a kind of destiny The fate is inside. He is currently writing a series of studies on buildings &quot;sitting south and facing north&quot;. This architectural form that &quot;conflicts&quot; with the norm fascinates him. Fushantang appeared at this time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Yan studied for a PhD in &quot;Architectural Archeology&quot; in Germany, and &quot;fine surveying&quot; is the core tool in this field. For a large building, complete architectural archeology may take several years, even decades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Germany, where Liu Yan studied, precision surveying and mapping is a &quot;basic plan&quot; for carrying out cultural preservation work. &quot;There are no levels of cultural preservation in Germany. As long as it is cultural preservation, it is necessary to do such a complete and in-depth survey and mapping.&quot; Liu Yan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A scholar of architectural archeology may not be able to do a few cases of precise surveying and mapping in his lifetime. Liu Yan&#39;s German mentor spent thirty years of his energy on a church. For the country, “this set of things is too luxurious. There are only a handful of cases across the country that can achieve the depth of architectural archeology through precise surveying and mapping. In Fujian, even the Luoyuan and Chen Taiwei Palace built in the Song Dynasty may not have been built yet.” Do enough mapping to match his identity,&quot; Liu Yan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Architectural archeology is an emerging discipline in China. Liu Yan vividly described archeology as digging down layer by layer, &quot;and their strata are spread horizontally.&quot; Architectural archeology discussed the overlapping historical layers in above-ground buildings. For example, a Song Dynasty building was replaced in the Ming Dynasty. A certain component, a corridor was added in the Qing Dynasty... Just like archeology, there are also &quot;strata&quot; layer by layer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/6c5fd28f5c.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/6c5fd28f5c.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259941&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The interior of the main hall of Fuxiantang. Photo courtesy/&quot;No name for now&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhou Miao described Fushan Hall as a &quot;growing&quot; building: &quot;Obviously, it was expanded and expanded in different periods. Renovated.&quot; At the scene, Southern Weekend reporters were not given a detailed explanation of this development: there is an inscription from the Hongzhi Year of the Ming Dynasty under the purlin in the front of the main hall, an inscription from the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty under the porch, and an inscription from the Jiaqing reign of the Qing Dynasty in the side hall. , the stage shows the style of the late Qing Dynasty. The main hall itself contains different components and structures from the Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties, not to mention the rich &quot;strata&quot; overlapping of the entire building complex. &quot;Using &#39;Yuan to Qing&#39; to describe the age of Fushan Hall is more accurate and closer to the essence of architectural heritage.&quot; I don&#39;t think so yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Yan said that architectural archeology is &quot;architectural detective science.&quot; Through comprehensive collection of on-site clues, architects can find subtle changes in buildings in the river of time, thereby inferring social and personnel changes in the past dynasties. This is what he wants to do to Fuxiantang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;What the early Architecture Society did was architectural archeology, but at that time the focus of scholars&#39; work was still to find the earliest buildings, and to find Tang Gou structures. , Looking for Song Gou, I can’t wait to peel off all the historical coverage of the Ming and Qing Dynasties.” Liu Yan said. The main hall of Hualin Temple in Fuzhou is such a classic representative. &quot;The original survey map did not even record the Qing Dynasty corridor. During the restoration and repair, the Qing Dynasty corridor was directly demolished.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Today&#39;s architectural archeology is different from the pursuits of early scholars. On the one hand, it pursues more detailed surveying and mapping, and on the other hand, it pays more attention to the &quot;life story&quot; of a building - the completeness of a building. The life narrative of a city not only focuses on its &quot;first construction&quot; or &quot;original&quot; youthful and heroic appearance, but also understands its changes through the ages and its life state until its twilight years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;To understand the &quot;growth&quot; of Fu Shan Tang, we must not only start with the building itself, but also the historical environment where the building is located is also a key factor. Before the road was opened, the only way to enter and exit Zhengwei Village was through an ancient post road across a mountain stream. The ancient post road was connected to covered bridges. There was a covered bridge, Xian&#39;en Bridge, at the entrance of the village, and a covered bridge, Desheng Bridge, at the end of the village. The two covered bridges marked the entrance. The only access to the village. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The ancient post road was paved with wide stone slabs. &quot;The ancient road was so wide, it can be seen that the village itself had financial resources in ancient times.&quot; Liu Yan speculated. There are two more covered bridges next to the village. &quot;Those who have the ability to build covered bridges must be because the village is located on an important passage. It may be an important trade route in ancient times. People must pass through here to have the motivation to build it.&quot; Such a large covered bridge.&quot; Zhou Miao said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What surprised Zhou Miao even more was the Ming Dynasty residences in Zhengwei Village. &quot;It is already a great thing to have Ming Dynasty residences in a village, and Zhengwei Village There may be more than five or six Ming Dynasty residences, and there are also many exquisite Qing Dynasty residences, which shows that this village has been prosperous for a long time. Its population reproduction and wealth accumulation must far exceed that of other surrounding villages.&quot; The accumulation of wealth has made Fushantang Large-scale reconstruction was carried out in the Yuan Dynasty, and during the Ming and Qing Dynasties, there was the possibility of continuous growth, with side halls, corridors, and stages...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http ://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/bf8914da2f.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1188&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/bf8914da2f.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259942&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;福There is a stone tablet next to the entrance of the charity hall, which is engraved with the &quot;Yicang Stele&quot; written in the 50th year of Qianlong&#39;s reign. It has a chronicle on the front and a name on the back. According to this monument, there was originally a Mingjiao temple not far from Zhengwei Village. After it was abandoned, the villagers reclaimed the land and set up a charity warehouse in Fushan Hall, which could not only support the village, but also invest in public affairs, just like the current charity foundation. Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Wang Huazhen&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The main industry in Zhengwei Village is timber. The towering ancient trees in the surrounding mountains are the village&#39;s greatest wealth. In ancient times, villagers cut down trees and put the wood into the river. Following the water flow, they arrived in Fuzhou. Until the reform and opening up, the village had always been an important part of the timber industry chain in northeastern Fujian. &quot;We still have land in Fuzhou, and we were relatively wealthy at that time.&quot; Zheng Fawang said that his ancestors were also engaged in the timber business. His ancestral house was built in the late Qing Dynasty and is located in the middle of Zhengwei Village. It is also a tall building. A mansion with deep walls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;By combining clan power with industry, the Zheng clan controls large areas of surrounding mountains and forests. Now several surrounding villages are also dominated by the Zheng surname. In ancient times, it was the &#39;sphere of influence&#39; of Zhengwei Village.&quot; said Zheng Jinlan, a staff member of the Dikou Town Cultural Station. Her hometown is in a village not far from Zhengwei Village, and her family&#39;s Zheng surname is derived from Zhengwei Village. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Bad - As long as there are people’s activities, the buildings will be changed&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Walking in the alleys of the village, there were once tall ancient houses on both sides , many of which are only ruins. Not long after the Bailu solar term passed, a red paper notice for &quot;Bailu Tomb Sweeping&quot; was posted on the notice board in the village. It read &quot;Guimao Year, Bawu Cemetery&quot; - Bawu Gong was Zheng Hao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Different from the general Qingming tomb sweeping, Zhengwei Village arranges ancestor worship and sweeping in the Bailu solar term every year. This custom is said to have lasted for hundreds of years. According to the villagers, during the white dew, the water comes out and the water steps in the stream are easier to walk, so it was decided to visit the tomb at this time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Fushantang plays the role of the faith center in the small regional community centered on Zhengwei Village. When women in the village reach the age of 60, they will go to Fushan Hall to hold a grand ceremony, wearing special cyan clothes and bright red flowers on their heads, &quot;just like primary school students registering at school when they are old.&quot; Zheng Fawang said that the local People call them Qingyi Zhaipo. The Tsing Yi Zhaipo&#39;s daily chanting place is Fu Shan Tang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/a7e2df5f17.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/a7e2df5f17.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259943&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;There is a close relationship between Qingyi Zhaipo.

They chanted sutras, burned incense and chatted. Fun, bask in the sun, laugh and laugh, and cover the scriptures. Obviously, the religious space has become a public space. During the days when they read the scriptures, they temporarily left their families and spent a period of time with their sisters without trouble. Fu Shantang is the small asylum of Tsing Yi Zhai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; February 19th Guanyin, the birthday of the eighth day of April, November 17th Amitabha&#39;s birthday ... On these grand days, Qingyi Zhai They will do things in Foshantang. And the most lively day of Fushan Hall in the year is to count the 13th to the fifteenth month of the first month. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; At the twelfth month of the first month, the people in Zheng Weicun drove more than 80 kilometers to go to Linshui Palace next door. Tour in the village. The name of Lin Shui Niang is Chen Jinggu. She is a popular folk belief in the mountainous area of ​​northern Fujian, southern Zhejiang. There is Lin Mo Niang on the seaside, Chen Jinggu in the mountains, and Gutian Linshui Palace is her ancestral temple. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; At 4 or five in the morning of the first month of the first month, please return from the Temple of the Gutianzu Temple, the truck is carried by the idol, a team of cars follows, and the mighty is mighty. Open back to Zheng Weicun. In the first month of 2023, Zheng Fangwang followed the team to Gutian. The high speed of more than an hour was a difficult mountain road in ancient times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Please go back to Linshui Niangniang, walk across the village entrance, and calm the village entrance in a small temple in the village. The architectural history of this temple has also been more than 200 years. The temple&#39;s beam reads the inscriptions during the Jiaqing period of the Qing Dynasty. In the afternoon of the day, the villagers carried the idols and swim in the whole village. Finally, it went to the Fushan Hall on the left of the village. In the face of the Fushan Hall, everyone put the idol. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Fourteen and fifteen days is a lively scene of the drama. The show is for God, of course, the mountain people in Shili and Eight Township can also look at it. The troupe in the village performed hard, the villagers asked God to bless, the firecrackers red candles reflected the sky, and the god of swimming in the first month reached a climax. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Few villages in the mountains have their own troupes. Zheng Weicun&#39;s Zhenglong Drama Troupe has more than two hundred years of history. On the wall of the wooden board in the backstage of the theater, there is a title of the seven -year play troupe of Guangxu. If Zheng Fangwang&#39;s grandfather is still alive, he is more than a hundred years old. Zheng Fangwang remembers that his grandfather had been in the troupe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;&quot; src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/8d36a45.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot; 1080 &quot;height =&quot; 1228 &quot;data-src =&quot; // images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/8d36a45.jpg &quot;data- key =&quot; 259944 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p STYLE = &quot;COLOR: #999999; Text-Align: Center;&quot;>; The Qing Dynasty theater opposite the Fushan Hall, the fourteenth and fifteenth day of each year, Zhenglong&#39;s drama team entered the gods here.

Nanya town next to last month has just invited them to perform. Nowadays, there are more than 20 or 30 people in the theater. The actors and musicians are the uncle and aunt in the village. &quot;Now no young people have joined, there is no fixed income.&quot; Zheng Fangwang told the southern weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Zhou Miao studied ancient buildings in Shanxi in the early years. He found that many temples in Shanxi, especially the older and early, have been controlled by the cultural relics department, and the incense has gradually been cut off. The relationship between local residents and it is getting more and more alienated. &quot;The building and the life of people here are still closely related. The traditional sacrifice ritual, space, and belief habits can still be bound to this settlement and this building.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align : LEFT; &quot;>; In 1951, Zheng Weicun Elementary School was founded in Fushan Hall with dozens of students. In 1960, Fu Shantang was opened as a public canteen. Unlike the Shanxi Village Temple, the policy relaxed after the reform and opening up, and Fushan Hall soon became the center of Zhengwei Village&#39;s belief activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; However, faith activities and ancient construction protection seem to be a difficult contradiction. After the discovery of the Fushan Hall, the leaders of the Provincial Bureau of Cultural Relics have repeatedly instructed Zheng Fangwang Fushan Hall. Zhou Miao remembered that in the 30th year of 2019, a burst of fire in the ancient gallery bridge of Jian&#39;ou City, &quot;because there are too many people burning incense on the bridge that day.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; As long as there are people&#39;s activities, the building will be changed. Sometimes this change is slow, growing slowly like Fu Shantang, and human activities are gently scrued like waves. But some fierce changes have been common in recent years. In early November 2023, it was not found that the Village, Gutian County, Fujian, was built in the 12th year of Ming Hongzhi (1499) in the 12th year of Ming Hongzhi (1499). &quot;Donkey is not a monster.&quot; Villagers have money and want to rebuild the ancestral temple. It is common for the ancestral ancestral temple, but I don&#39;t think this is a non -matching level of cultural and economic level. Until before being demolished by the villagers, it was neither cultural relic nor a historic building, and there was no protection identity at all. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &lt;span>; empty-what to leave &lt;/span>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Before the founding of New China, Zheng Weicun was armed by his own forces village. At the most, there are more than a hundred guns in the village, like a small army. Until now, the streets in the village are still posted on the slogan of &quot;hiding guns and not allowing the law&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;&quot; src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/1b56481471.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot; 1080 &quot;height =&quot; 1192 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/1b56481471.jpg &quot;data- key =&quot; 259945 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p STYLE = &quot;COLOR: #999999; Text-Align: Center;&quot;>; In October 2023, the slogan posted on the streets of Zhengwei Village. Southern Weekend reporter Wang Huazhen Photo &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Zheng Fangwang and the elderly in the village cannot say the reason for this, and various documents and materials have not clearly recorded why there is such a mountain village. Large -scale armed. Many people speculated that at that time, Zheng Weicun controlled the nearby mountains, and Zheng was the local family. In the troubled times, the clan was self -defense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In the spring of 1936, the Communist Party of China established the Town of Jianqiakou as the center, including Jian&#39;er, Songxi, Zhenghe, Gutian, northeast Fujian, northeast Fujian. Guerrilla base. The villagers were quickly combined with the northeast Fujian guerrillas to become a reliable backup of guerrillas. As the villagers of Zhengwei Village are very familiar with firearms, the Zheng&#39;s Ancestral Hall in the center of the village naturally became the guerrilla firearm repair plant. Today, the pentagram above the main entrance of the shrine was the sign of the firearm repair plant in Northeast Fujian guerrillas at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;&quot; src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/16c28ba.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot; 1080 &quot;height =&quot; 1360 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/16fb3c28ba.jpg &quot;data- key =&quot; 259946 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p STYLE = &quot;COLOR: #999999; Text-Align: Center;&quot;>; Zheng Weicun&#39;s Zheng&#39;s ancestral temple. Southern Weekend reporter Wang Huazhen Photo &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-alft;&quot;>; Fu Shantang also witnessed this red history. On May 13, 1948, Zeng Jingbing, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese and Zhejiang and Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, and more than 200 guerrilla members watched Gan opera with local villagers in Fushantang. Later, Fu Shantang became a general cultural relic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;1982年，村民对福善堂大殿局部修缮，据暂不观察，当时的用料粗陋细小，“与原构相去甚远”， It may be that the conditions are too limited. In 2017, Zheng Weicun obtained the protection of the &quot;traditional Chinese village&quot;. The Fushan Hall and Porcelain Porcelain were repaired local. In 1982, the components that did not meet the specifications were replaced, and the roof was also renovated. Now in the temple, the light -colored wood is replaced in 2017, and the difference between the dark and old materials is clearly distinguished. It is this cautious repair that keeps many questions in Foshantang in Mo Shu&#39;s titles in mind. Until six years, you will not carry infrared cameras to visit again ... &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left; &quot;>; Compared to Yu&#39;s Ancestral Temple, the Fushan Hall is lucky. It enjoys hundreds of years of incense, and because of the special identity of the affiliated architectural drama, it has escaped the change of the turmoil of the 20th century until a group of people discovered it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;&quot; src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/728732b.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot; 1080 &quot;height =&quot; 810 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/728732b.jpg &quot;data- key =&quot; 259947 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p STYLE = &quot;COLOR: #999999; Text-Align: Center;&quot;>; Overlooking from the hill behind Fushantang, the Fushantang building group is covered in the green bamboo. Southern Weekend reporter Wang Huazhen Photo &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; According to the current no statistics, the newly discovered early wooden buildings in Fujian Province have been found in recent years. The removal of Yu&#39;s ancestral temple, as well as Anxi Baofengyan (during the Ming Yongle period), Zhangping Longjian Palace (1482), Youxi Zhuo&#39;s Temple (During the Ming Dynasty), Datian Hongnong Temple (Ming Chenghua to Hongzhi period ), Yongtai Xianpu Realm (1513) ... Most of them have no protection identity. &quot;They have a very accurate and complete sorting of historical buildings.&quot; Liu Yan and Zhou Miao have a lot of contact with local ancient building enthusiasts in Fujian. Compared with official statistics, they sometimes rely on these people material. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;One problem now is that many local governments are actually unwilling to bear this risk, knowing that it is a valuable cultural relic, but it is not willing to report it. The situation exists. &quot;Zheng Jinlan told the reporter from the southern weekend. As long as it is not reported as a cultural relic point, no one needs to be responsible after being damaged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Protecting as many ancient architectural samples as possible is the basis for scholars to conduct systematic research. What is the position of Fu Shantang in the Yuan Dynasty architecture? Zhou Miao, who specializes in the Song and Yuan architecture, is difficult to say, &quot;because there are too few Yuan Dynasty architecture in the south.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The Yuan Dynasty buildings in the north are relatively retained, and in specific areas, the number can be analyzed as much as possible. &quot;In the north, it can be a level distinction of architecture in the Yuan Dynasty to comment on what different levels look like.&quot; Zhou Miao said. If Fushan Hall is placed in the northern yuan structure, then it is undoubtedly the level of low -level village Buddhist temples, but its hall is much larger than ordinary villages and temples. &quot;After the Northern Yuan Dynasty The combination of the structure of low -level buildings began to become messy, mixed, or messy and not particular about it. But the regulation and order of Foshantang are still pretty good, which is unexpected. &quot; /p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The Hall of Foshan Hall has gone through the storm of history, and now it is facing the empty nest of the countryside. Before the 1950s, there were more than 500 households in the village. Nowadays, there are only less than 800 people left in Zhengwei Village, and the entire administrative village (including 6 natural villages in the surrounding are). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Behind ancient buildings are not only discoverers and researchers, but also users who are closely related to them. After the logging industry disappeared, the village was in fact. The entire village costs about 200,000 yuan a year. The salary of the village committees and the village&#39;s sanitary expenses are sometimes difficult to guarantee. There are no young people in the village. After this generation of Tsing Yi Zhai&#39;s death, the daily maintenance and use of Fushantang is likely to lose activity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Liu Yan is also very interested in the rituals and costumes of Tsing Yi Zhai, as well as the village&#39;s drama class. &quot;This village seems to have a kind of magic, which can retain so many ancient things.&quot; He plans to investigate and surveys and mapping again next year&#39;s winter vacation and summer vacation, and &quot;soak&quot; in the local area for a long time to do the field survey of real architecture anthropology. &quot;It is more interesting to combine people and architecture.&quot; He also understands that if he does not record as soon as possible, the whole cultural system around Fu Shantang will disappear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Jian&#39;er&#39;s &quot;upgrade&quot; movement of Fu Shantang is unfolding. Originally, Fushantang was just a general cultural protection point, and even the county insurance was not. Now it is promoted by &quot;cross -level&quot;. You can do a promotion work. &quot;Zheng Jinlan said. The provincial insurance is prepared for the future of the national security. &quot;The southern wood structure of the Yuan Dynasty will definitely enter the national insurance.&quot; Liu Yan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Qingyi Zhai&#39;s daily lesson will definitely be affected by the upgrading of cultural relics protection levels. Zheng Fawang intends to prepare a tripod for them outside the temple so that the fragrant candle will no longer enter the hall. After bidding farewell to Qingyi Zhai, Liu Yanhe did not continue to drive north to visit Yunfeng Temple in Mountain Mountain. For the time being, it is a national security building in the west and east. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[《再见爱人》：婚姻里谁都没错，日子怎么就没法过]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261541]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-29 18:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/23/ 11/29/92i6yai3L2S2KIC36TXISOT8B4Meqevr9idfu0kz.jpg &quot;Border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 640 &quot;height =&quot; 960 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm/cms/medias/i MAGE/23/11/29/92i6YAI3L2S2KIC36TXISOT8B4MEQEVR9idfu0kz. jpg &quot;data-key =&quot; 260006 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999; text-align: center; &quot;>;&quot; Goodbye lover &quot;producer Liu Le &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaaaaaa ; &quot;(Provided by the interviewee/picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot; Goodbye Lover &quot;achieved the third season, producer Liu Le finally realized the dream when he proposed the plan -with the guests Enter the Civil Affairs Bureau for a day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The Office of the Civil Affairs Bureau of Aheqi County is less than 200 square meters, and marriage and divorce are completed here. The three pairs of guests who did not know whether they would divorce witnessed several binding to local couples and the discrete of the family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Liu Le was once a social journalist and squatted in the Civil Affairs Bureau. After deciding to do &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot;, she asked the team to squat at the door of the Civil Affairs Bureau. Although it was unsuccessful, the members faced the original shock. They couldn&#39;t say anything at the moment. &quot;I want to make sadness and joy in the same place, and the human feelings are not connected. Have you thought about being separated when you promise? Do you remember the promise at the time when you separate?&quot; Liu Le said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2021, the reality show &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot;, which is closely associated with &quot;divorce&quot;. In the show, the three guests who had problems in the marriage carried out a 18 -day trip, returning to the beauty of Prime Minister love, analyzing the question of marriage, and finding the answer to feelings. The show presented a trivial life in public, and the excavation of the details of marriage and deep contradictions resonated with the audience. In the fall of 2023, the third quarter of &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; was broadcast. Fu Shier and Lao Liu, Ji Huanbo and Wang Shiqing, Wang Sleeping and Zhang Shuang&#39;s lovers who &quot;looked beautiful&quot; to outsiders broke the illusion, faced their own dilemma, and again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again. Discussion on intimate relationships. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The core, producer, and director of this program Liu Le has been a social journalist for four years, and the director of &quot;Happy Camp&quot; in ten years. In the past three years, in addition to the &quot;Goodbye Love&quot; series, her The work also has &quot;Spring Days Scene again&quot; -also related to divorce. She has been paying attention to emotional topics for a long time. She likes to send emotional paragraphs from time to time from time to time many years ago. She went to do &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; and &quot;Separate Separation Separation&quot;. Most of the program copywriting was written by her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; is the general general experience of Liu Le&#39;s more than ten years of experience. Among them, the tactile and sensitivity of traditional journalists, the entertainment and dexterity of variety director, the sharpness and sharp edge of the emotion blogger. As a single woman, she promoted many married people to take a step forward in the exploration of marriage and intimacy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After the program was broadcast, Liu Le got more concern and support than expected. Some colleagues even wanted to get married after watching it. The guest of the observation room, Hu Yanbin, told her: &quot;If the parting is not so terrible, we have such a deep care and such a good wish for each other, and we have such a decent difference, then I also long for marriage.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &quot; After the third season of the Lover &quot;, Liu Le accepted our interview, telling the joy, bitterness and human nature of the show related to the show since the three seasons. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Can&#39;t you divorce if you don&#39;t quarrel? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; &quot;Goodbye lover&quot; to the third season, still touching can still be touched What&#39;s yours? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Liu Le: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; This season&#39;s most shocked me is the sense of misunderstanding of Seoul and Lao Liu. Before I came, I told me, can I not quarrel, can I do it? I said who said &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; to quarrel, and if you don&#39;t make noisy. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When we went to the Civil Affairs Bureau, the director asked why he couldn&#39;t survive and what happened? Do you not go home? Is it drinking? Do you hit you? He has a lot of &quot;clinical experiments&quot; experience, and these problems he raised are very gold -content. When we hear other people&#39;s divorce in daily life, we will ask what is the problem. If he said that there was no problem, why would he divorce? Good days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The inertia thinking of many people must be derailed. I have to lie to me, and I can divorce. no. So our main concept this season is painful and grows slowly. I can&#39;t tell what it has. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When the first few episodes were broadcast, everyone might feel whether it was moaning without illness, is it to say that she was worried, it was to make a set of words on the show. Like Seoul, the first half and the second half of the broadcast, I have seen some public accounts. At the beginning, I wrote that Fu Shouer must be here to make money, and she would definitely not divorce. After a few episodes, there was a public account, and Fu Shier must have been here to make money, because she had already planned to leave. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; How do you know her, this is also the most difficult place to persuade Seoul. Everyone will wonder if she is utilitarian. I told her, if you are willing to face your real dilemma, you will come. This sound will not dissipate. The most important point for persuading her is that she has real emotional demands. The marriage of more than ten years has been rooted in her heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I have known her for several years. When I was still in &quot;Happy Camp&quot;, she came to be my guest. She said that I was particularly envious of your state, a state of falling in love at any time. I said, do you encounter any confusion in marriage? I talked to her. After doing &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot;, she often sent me some look after the first two seasons. I think what she said actually took her with her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Seoul&#39;s defense is very strong. She will protect herself and want to talk about it, but she will not speak very thoroughly. It looks like he is, but there must be a sore in her heart that I want to make everyone happy, and I really want to dig this thing. After the second season, I mentioned to her, there must be a process of persuasion. I told her that if you are determined, everything is not a matter. The problem is the problem, but it can be solved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; My judgment is that she will face it sooner or later, not to say that she must come to the show, but she has a lot of knots in her heart, and she can&#39;t solve it through chatting with friends. On the one hand, she wants to seek change, and on the other hand, she is also eager to be understood by more people. She still has a large part of the &quot;old script&quot;. I have been married for more than ten years. Everyone has not made any mistakes. We have done our best. Why is it not good? If so, can we choose to separate? I feel that she and Lao Liu are both trapped. In this case, she couldn&#39;t really reconcile, so that she was willing to spread everything to everyone. Can it be understood? She is so eager to be understood, her pioneer is old, active and passive, and is a very charming contradiction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I hope that one day she can accept her true trap and not go closer to another kind of life. This may be easier, but Seoul is a person who is not easy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/l2mmkm7vnufwoevollb9gcugv5gjit.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; widt h = &quot;960&quot; height = &quot;640&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/l2mmkm7vnufwoevollb9gcu4sfugv5gjit.jpg&quot; data- &quot;>; 260011&quot;>; &lt;/p. >; &lt;p style = &quot;coloror : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>; In the third season of&quot; Goodbye Lover &quot;, six guests celebrate the 14th anniversary of Fu Shier and Liu Yi&#39;s wedding &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; Do not separate easily, nor do it dying &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_ GB2312, Stkaiti; &quot;>; How did the other two pairs of guests find it? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Liu Le: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; The other two pairs are all registered by themselves. Wang Shiqing signed up in the second season, but at that time, I talked to her. She didn&#39;t have such a big contradiction like this season. This year, I felt much much. After opening the closed state of last year, entering a dynamics will bring a lot of severe impact. If the relationship itself is very good, this dynamics may make you better. If it is not good, it will be accelerated. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; There are more opportunities to work in Shiqing. Obviously, I feel that I seem to be stronger. &quot;. And the person who wants to hold me, his movements have become more obvious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Wang signed up after the second season. At that time, many quarrels of Zhang Wanting and Song Ningfeng made her think of herself. She felt that she also liked scolding and unhappy, so she filled in the registration form. The earliest information about them did not show so many problems as showing in the show. In the first round of contact, many directors judged that they were garlic. The problem was too fine. Extension space and so on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I said that what will happen is to be really worthy of extension? Will the show team trapped by a so -called heart that wants to pursue texture? Is it too fascinated on the presentation of intimate relationships, too fascinating those things that are invisible, unable to touch, and unclear, and those things that can be clear, touched, caught, and can directly judge whether they are right or wrong. Are we excluded from we? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; We reflected. In the first season, Zhu Yaqiong said a lot of feelings, but in the end it was remembered that the hug of that minute. Still implementation on specific events. Specific incidents can make people start, and they can reflect on whether they have such behavior and better establish a comparison coordinate system, so we set them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Many people say that &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; is to rely on fierce quarrels to attract attention. No, the show group does not want to be endless. That thing makes people despair and suffocate. But because it is a reality show, once they start, we cannot interfere. We can&#39;t go up and tell them not to quarrel. You quickly give me good reconciliation, and it is impossible to tell them that you two can start to quarrel now. This is too ridiculous. What we can do is to record truthfully. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; What topics do the flying guests join in and what new projects can be done. These can be invisible into the journey and trigger their changes. Other do not know what the game they would blow up at all, and which sentence made him angry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; You see Zhang Shuo sent a WeChat to the best man at the time &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; The quarrel, the two were unhappy. Then they quarreled because of other things. At this time, Zhang Shuo sent a WeChat to the best man to try to alleviate the contradiction with sleeping) &lt;/span>;. The most real feeling at that moment was that it was good to do so well. It must be able to recover: She was angry because of other things, and I immediately did something to make up for this. But it was because he did these things that the audience intuitively felt that his model was to dismantle the east wall to make up the west wall, and the disassembly was not good, and the supplement was not good. The whole person was very perfunctory. Is this perfunctory social normal? yes. So it triggered the greatest resonance. The quarrel can only let everyone look at the excitement, but the pain behind the quarrel can be left after the lively. It is a point of empathy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I think Zhang Shuo still represents a very common phenomenon: I don&#39;t need to make this matter 100 points, I will always control my efforts, just do 10 points, 20 points, 20 points, 20 points Just be fine, lying flat anywhere, whether he is working, social or love. Huang Zhizhong was right, he was very stinging his energy. Now I have paid 10 points. If you do n’t admit that my 10 -point value, I ’m not happy. Is this selfish? of course. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; So the hot search of &quot;mirror of society&quot; behind Zhang Shuo, I think the audience can also feel very intuitive how weak this emotional model is for contemporary young people. Why don&#39;t so many people want to fall in love? Everyone said that I don&#39;t need to be so full, if love is not deeply loved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In fact, Zhang Shuo has many advantages. We are angry with him, but we can&#39;t hate it. He is really a kind child, and he takes care of the surrounding emotions very much. But why is this mode of intimacy? The show has been exploring, and the observation room is also talking. (One of the reasons may be) people are eager for positive feedback, which is a physiological mechanism. If I do something wrong, I hope to get some suggestions, rather than being questioned whether it is wrong? No one likes to be pumped by the whip. After pumping, I may do worse. This is a behavioral mechanism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; The show barrage many write &quot;Sleeping and Run&quot;, Everyone can&#39;t understand why they have to be together. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Liu Le: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; I think the audience has seen a presentation directly, and I feel that I do n’t break up like this? But as a sleeping, this person is my first love. I have been together for 10 years. He used to be very good to me. It is not easy to be separated. When you encounter a problem, you must still want to solve it first. What exactly changed? Can I change it? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; People have hope, this is a very positive thing. In the past, most of the people took the other extreme. No matter how hard it was, no matter how tired, and how much grievances, we had to live this life without divorce. Now the new trend is: a little wrong, worship immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; has always wanted to find a middle balance, neither separate separation nor dragging. We want to have the ability that can be left and repaired, maybe this is a more sound love. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I believe that for Wang&#39;s sleep, when she decided to come to the show, she just wanted to give this relationship a last chance. If they can be good, continue, and they will be separated. In the process, every sway, anger, and soft heart are extremely sincere, and she is trying to re -recognize the person. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; Zhang Shuo&#39;s behavior caused a lot controversy. What is his feedback? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Liu Le: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; He is very painful. It feels that the self is completely shattered and denied all aspects. During the broadcast, he will come to discuss with us from time to time. Basically, it is self -provoking. I think this is very difficult. No one can truly acknowledge that they are a bad person. This is a cruel thing, and it takes time, but we see that Zhang Shuo has been working hard. He is still an exploration gesture. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Zhang Shuo is a very sunny person in the show, and he can find fun for himself. Regardless of whether these public opinion is correct or not, he has a great impact on him. He was painful and had to admit that some comments might make sense. Just like people want to digest the knife, a knife is already in the flesh. It is cutting my tumor, which is painful and must endure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/nlyvekva0EQTXGRSUPSLEL6WYAAZCQ6ut.jpg&quot; 0 &quot;width = &quot;960&quot; height = &quot;640&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/nlyvekva0eqtxgrsupslel6wyprru1fvaazcq6ut.jpg&quot; data-key = &quot;260013&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>;&quot; Goodbye Lover &quot;Season 3 Guest Wang Sleeping (left) and Zhang Shuo &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt; p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; The strong men&#39;s weak comments on this season, this is your intention Is it for it? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Liu Le: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; It is not intentional. Usually, we do not save materials for the same nature. It is found that we can get out of this thing during the process of savoryness. Like the first issue of &quot;Looks Beautiful&quot;, it is the commonality we have come out. The three pairs are separated before the separation. In the separate material of everyone, we have taken this point that our marriage is good for outsiders, but it is not actually the case. &lt;/SPAN>; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; As for the female strong and weak, I think we just provide a discussion perspective. Maybe everyone will have such a summary. In fact, none of these three pairs are strong women, but also weak places, so we discussed what is strong and economic strength? If there is only this dimension, it can be regarded as three pairs of women and men. But what about the right to speak? What about the need for love? What is the sense of existence in marriage? What about freedom and comfort? Who is the superior in emotion? Back to these dimensions, they may not be strong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; You just said that this show is a platform to explore a platform, this is this is this is a platform. Is the original intention of the show? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Liu Le: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; Only in this direction. Every time we meet a pair of partners, he comes to our show, and his performance may be somewhat exceeded: too manipulation, too insecure, too patient, etc. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; All the parts that exceed the threshold, we all want everyone to realize that this is a bit beyond, we can come back, we strive to stand in a safer area. But sometimes, when some problems happen, I also hope that everyone should not feel how big it is. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Now npd &lt;spd style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; (narcissistic personality disorder) &lt;/span>;, gas lamp &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: Kaita, Kaiti_GB2312, Stkaiti; &quot;>; (a psychological manipulation method) &lt;/span>;, edge personality and other nouns often appear. What is the definition of professional? Will there be an overkill part? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I have been thinking about this problem since the second season. Once this person&#39;s behavior is beyond our daily cognition, can we conclude that he is a lunatic? Or once we give a person a judgment, is it unattainable all the words he said next? I don&#39;t think so. Teacher Guo &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; (Guo Keyu) &lt;/span>; In the first season, &quot;people have too many noodles.&quot; I particularly agree with this sentence . People are all kinds of people with crazy, low, high -value, and low -value people. People themselves are complex and imperfect animals, but they ask for the love of being loved. Everyone is equal, and everyone is equal. This is why &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; has not strictly distinguished stars or amateur. We all put them in one field for discussion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I have read a comment that &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; is like Jielu Ban lock, making the deduction tighter enough, so that the endangered scattered frame is smooth, rather than violent disassembly or never puzzled Open, we all find a final ending for all the crumbling Luban locks. I agree. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; When talking about intimacy is no longer ashamed &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot; >; Why did you think of doing such a show at that time? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Liu Le: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; From the industry, the divorce track was a vacancy, and the major platforms were exploring the divorce IP. Some problems at home and abroad have not been solved. For example, what is the appeal? If you have divorced and put you on a travel together, do you have a demand? Or is this a show&#39;s demand? Is it a demand for watching? If the characters have no demands, the things presented may be very empty and float. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Divorce cooling period is the key to I think of this IP, it can be used as a appeal. The earliest locking was a couple who had entered the calm period. In only 30 days, we have to go to see this list. In marriage, everyone may have thought about divorce countless times. Why do you think? What do you put into time after thinking? Go to repair, or ignore it? ... There are a lot of characters in it to be described, and because the divorce action has not been really completed, we still have room for discussion. The guests in the third season should be said to be the earliest solution that fits my earliest, and it has not been finished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first two seasons were also based on such an idea. The people we chose at least did not be cold in our judgment, and there was no story to tell. The divorce is too long. It is best to be less than two or three years. From time to time, these two people have some exchanges, and some people have even proposed composite and so on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In daily life, it is very clear to see other people&#39;s affairs. It can always be dragged when you look at your own things. Maybe it&#39;s better. Without a huge incident, it is not easy for people to start a knife in a relatively smooth and ups and downs. Everyone is not conscious of deep cracks. How can there be power to perceive this and who would have an X -ray of their emotions? Many people are either out of fear or laziness and escape. It&#39;s almost okay. What do you always say? In particular, this is more common in the relationship. What can be discussed? I want to go out to drink. I have a lot of colleagues, and the company is so many things. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Communication and communication many times is a matter of two people, not a unilateral choice. If I tell others, I want to talk to my lover about the problems in our marriage in the past eight years, but He doesn&#39;t talk to me well, so I want to divorce him, others may say that you are sick. But in the field of &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot;, no matter how small the problem is, you will be valued, and everyone will come to discuss. Then how do you talk about this, should you get a marriage? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; focused on many of the problems in the close relationship. I made this place with a large mirror. Everyone said that your problem seems to be worthy of attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This is at least for those who are trapped in marriage, those who want to marry, and those who want to talk about these are embarrassed. I am no longer ashamed. I want to talk to you today. Chat, we communicate with me. I don&#39;t think this is very abrupt, I don&#39;t feel ashamed. This is healthy. This is also a courage and a kind of courage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot; Relative place? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Liu Le: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; Selecting these places on the one hand is good -looking. The primitive and natural beauty is very important. When people can&#39;t figure it out, they should contact nature, but few people do this. The place where we choose is to stay for a long time, making them very difficult, and to the extreme, it feels that the heavens and the earth and the small people are small, which is an intuitive psychological suggestion. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Naturally, it still has a strong healing effect. We strive to create a high -purity (shooting) environment, so that they can rest assured that they can enter the deep -water area for discussion. This process is not easy. Beauty is a short -lived comfort. In any case, they are a very, very brave group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/g88g4zhwnzmhkogpkjaoqbygcr9cwpo.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot;960&quot; height = &quot;640&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/g88g4zhwnzmhkogmanjggwkjaoqbygcr9cwpo.jpg&quot; data-key = &quot;260017&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>;&quot; Goodbye Lover &quot;Season 2 &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; Charming of love, praising romance &lt;/h4 &lt;/h4 &lt;/h4 &lt;/h4 &lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; You have no marriage experience, the sweetness and pain of marriage in daily life are very fine. Really, how do you grasp these faint places in a divorce show? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Liu Le: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; I have to understand why he had to do such a thing at this moment. Why did he feel this? Why do you make such a judgment? It must not be 100 % common, but in this process, what is worth raising? These can be trained through training, that is, intuition of questions. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I think it&#39;s good to have not married. I have been in contact with some peers. I heard that I want to do this subject. I especially want to talk to me. I think everyone is too focused on themselves. It is easy to conclude, &quot;What is marriage?&quot; During that time, there were a lot of hearing, which was very different. The only commonality was that they all believed in their judgment in marriage. At this time, I was empty. I do n’t listen to anyone. I only use your words as a sample. The samples can have many kernels for the audience to summarize themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; If I already have a marriage, I dare not guarantee that I will say that this does not exist, because I did not encounter this situation in my marriage. This is too ridiculous and cut him. It is very dangerous without open thinking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Love must be different. When I do a show, I will go back to my past relationship and realize that I have made such a mistake. This is a very interesting thing. Seeing others see very clearly. When it comes to yourself, who is a perfect partner? So on the other hand, I think love is a long -term homework. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I look forward to my emotional concept from real feelings, not from the show. I hope &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; is an auxiliary material. It should not be the main course. You have to feel the real people, not some truth. Fu Shouer has already made a lot of reason, and Wang and sleep are very reasonable, but why are they still not so happy? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; The program has advanced to the present, the audience also felt a lot of laughter part of the laughter . But laughter cannot offset the substantial pain in marriage. What do you think of &quot;laugh&quot;? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Liu Le: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; Pain is pain. If the pain is down, laugh just to slide up. It may increase a bit of resistance to pain, or make people look down on the whole picture of pain more clearly. It is very artistic to deal with the pain. It is said that people come out of sadness from sadness, which is an artist. This smile is a kind of generous. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/fmmseze0ondlhxs62rj0tim23umaiu2jpg&quot; border = &quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 960 &quot;height =&quot; 872 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/fmmseze0ondlhxs62RJ0TIM23umai2JPG &quot;Data-key = &quot;260019&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p STYLE = &quot;COLOR: #999; Text-Align: Center;&quot;>; The first season of &quot;Goodbye Love&quot; &lt;span style = &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; How did you think of it? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Liu Le: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; I felt that young people were too easy to give up. I used to like to persuade others to be sober, but when more and more people are saying that they want to be sober, give up, this is no big deal, I realize that this may be a new trend. When we are discussing, we are discussing Said to pull these people who want to break up. Is the behavior of &quot;Come and talk about&quot; itself is a bit old, and is it a bit in line with the current status quo of young people &quot;I will always find new people&quot;? That&#39;s why we say that goodbye is easy or difficult. Thinking of &quot;goodbye&quot; and &quot;goodbye&quot;, English is &quot;See You&quot; and &quot;See You Again&quot;. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Modern people are too easy to see the flaws of others. There is no way to enter the deep water area and always switch in the shallow water area. When I was in love for several years, it seemed like the nourishment of people at that time. Now short videos are teaching you, &quot;I have to be vigilant if he do this&quot;, &quot;He doesn&#39;t say that he doesn&#39;t love you&quot; ... This disassembly is very rude. There are still many irritating parts in feelings. If everyone is influenced by these rough logic, I feel that we are all playing on the water. This is a pity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; You can get a lot of happiness when you don&#39;t need to fall in love, and you have to fall in love. This is an extremely romantic thing. I hope I can praise (this kind of love and romance). In the past, people may have many needs for reality. I need a person to face life with me. But now, it seems that the mobile phone is solved everything. Even if you do n’t fall in love or get married, everyone can live well. Under such circumstances, it is a romantic thing to find an intimate relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot; What is the reason? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Liu Le: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; Because it is really good, if you have passed the mountain, you can understand that the scenery there is very good, but the mountain climbing The process is very tired. I hope you do n’t climb because you are tired. Do n’t think it ’s the best on the ground. The ground is safe, easy, free, but not Go up, don&#39;t say that the scenery on the mountain is not rare. &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; shows you the rugged mountain road, but everyone can still climb their own mountains. Those who pay carefully will gain more scenery, which must be like this. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 18:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
