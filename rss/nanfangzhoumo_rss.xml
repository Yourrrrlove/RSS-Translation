The document requires that data from corpus blacklist sources should not be used for training; if the content of a single source corpus contains more than 5% of illegal and harmful information, it should be included in the blacklist. A total of 31 major security risks in 5 categories of corpus and generated content are given in the appendix. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For generative artificial intelligence, domestic regulation is almost in sync with technological development, reflecting the high importance attached to this technology. The &quot;Interim Measures for the Management of Generative Artificial Intelligence Services&quot; jointly issued by the Cyberspace Administration of China and multiple departments were released on July 10 and will come into effect on August 15. Article 17 of it stipulates: Provide services with public opinion attributes or social mobilization capabilities. For generative artificial intelligence services, security assessments should be carried out in accordance with relevant national regulations, and algorithm filing, change, and cancellation filing procedures should be performed in accordance with the &quot;Regulations on the Management of Algorithm Recommendations for Internet Information Services&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, many large models have been registered and can be officially launched online to provide services to the public, including Wen Xinyiyan (Baidu), Yunque (Douyin), Zidong Taichu (Chinese Academy of Sciences), etc. Articles 4 and 7 of the Measures respectively put forward certain requirements for the provision and use of generative artificial intelligence services and data training of models, involving multiple aspects such as values ​​and data sources. Obviously, the &quot;Basic Requirements for Security of Generative Artificial Intelligence Services&quot; that is currently soliciting opinions echoes and refines these regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is special and unique about generative artificial intelligence? I think everyone’s ears are getting calloused after hearing this. At present, some generative artificial intelligence such as GPT-4 may have crossed the threshold of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The translation of AGI as &quot;general artificial intelligence&quot; is actually somewhat misleading, because General Intelligence refers to &quot;general intelligence.&quot; Let children test their IQ and take Raven&#39;s Matrices test questions that exclude the influence of specific language and culture. What comes out is this &quot;general intelligence&quot;. AGI means that, through artificial methods, large models achieve &quot;general intelligence&quot; comparable to the human mind. A paper by Microsoft scientists shows that GPT-4’s intelligence is very close to human levels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a revolutionary breakthrough. Even if this type of large model approaches or reaches AGI, even if it is stable for a long time at a level equivalent to the average human intelligence level, its learning ability is beyond the reach of any human being: it can learn all the explicit knowledge created and accumulated by human beings, and any language can learn from it. It can master the knowledge of , pictures, audio and video presentation. This means that a large number of human knowledge jobs, such as translators and foreign language speaking teachers, can be replaced by this type of generative AI. The extent to which this will reshape our production and lifestyle is a question that everyone is concerned about and pondering. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, what values ​​generative artificial intelligence holds is an unavoidable question. We all have values. Why we have such values ​​depends not only on genes and other innate endowments, but also on acquired upbringing and habits. In the same way, without any intervention, the &quot;values&quot; of generative artificial intelligence depend on the corpus fed to it. The more corpus it is fed with a certain kind of value, the more it will exhibit that kind of value. If a certain value is artificially set for it in advance, then it will adhere to this value and reject negative interpretations of corpus that are inconsistent with its values. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the early versions of GPT, this feature has already appeared. A classic example is: when it was asked to write a hymn to Biden, it readily agreed, and the writing was very crude; when it was asked to write a hymn to Trump, it flatly refused, stating that it wanted to be &quot;politically neutral.&quot; Behind this is that the people who develop it hold these values. They can either set specific values ​​for it in advance, or feed it corpus impregnated with specific values, thereby shaping the values ​​of generative artificial intelligence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, in public view, developers will try their best to hide the values ​​​​of generative artificial intelligence, and adopt a verbal strategy of &quot;not offending anyone, not offending anyone&quot;, which sounds challenging. There is nothing wrong with this strategy itself being a reflection of certain values. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you think about it again, today&#39;s generative artificial intelligence is equivalent to having only a brain and no tangible body that can move freely, just like a soul floating in cyberspace. If this soul is &quot;infused&quot; into bionic robots or even intelligent robots whose mobility far exceeds that of human bodies in the future, the impact and potential harm to human society will be even greater. Can humans really control them effectively so that they only benefit and do not harm humans? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Science fiction writer Asimov set the Three Laws of Robots: Robots must not harm humans, or sit idly by and watch humans being harmed; robots must obey human orders unless they violate the first law; robots must obey human orders unless they violate the first or second law. Law of Two, otherwise the robot must protect itself. This is probably just wishful thinking. In the future, intelligent robots equipped with AGI may be imported or &quot;self-evolve&quot; with anti-human values, putting the survival of civilization and mankind at risk; or some individuals or organizations with distorted values ​​​​will weaponize intelligent robots equipped with AGI and eliminate them. other nationalities or races or groups they dislike. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, we are currently discussing: What can generative artificial intelligence do now and what can it do in the future? What values ​​should we hold? How big and what impact will it have on our production and lifestyle? Can humans harness it effectively? How much of a challenge will it pose to civilization and human existence itself? These questions are relevant and relevant to everyone on earth now and in the future. This is not unfounded worry, but preparation for a rainy day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 18 Oct 2023 16:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“加沙没有安全的地方”，巴以厮杀循环何时休]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258796]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-18 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/YjXrbrguwqGdYd7GdGeoQGSkoPy41PzHdCLMiDOB.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;639&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/YjXrbrguwqGdYd7GdGeoQGSkoPy41PzHdCL MiDOB. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254362&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;This is the Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip taken on the Israeli side of the Gaza border on October 15 Thick smoke rose behind. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo by Xinhua News Agency Ilan Asayag/Kini Photo Agency/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There is an emergency now, I&#39;m sorry The original interview plan will be postponed again.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of October 14, 2023, staff from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (hereinafter referred to as &quot;UNRWA&quot;) sent a message to Southern Weekend reporters News comes, postponing an interview with Communications Director Julia Tuma. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just the day before, the agency announced that &quot;due to increased Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip&quot; it had moved its operations center and staff to the southern Gaza Strip to continue supporting Palestinian refugees in the Gaza Strip. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a statement issued by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) on October 17, the number of humanitarian workers killed in Gaza has increased to 31. Gaza has experienced a &quot;total power outage&quot; for the sixth consecutive day, the statement said. Gaza hospitals are on the verge of collapse, with fuel reserves used to run backup generators almost completely depleted, putting the lives of thousands of patients at risk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of the 15th, two days ago, IDF spokesman Jonathan Conricus posted a video on social media, once again issuing a warning to residents of northern Gaza, causing Palestinians in the area to flee to South. The Israeli military had previously issued a similar evacuation order to Gaza. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This violent fight continues to expand in a cycle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under Israel&#39;s counterattacks in recent days, today&#39;s Gaza neighborhoods have become beyond recognition, with ruins and ruins visible everywhere. In fear, many Gaza residents embarked on a journey to escape. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We witness death every day.” local Said Shoaib wrote on social media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, Israel has implemented a comprehensive blockade on the Gaza Strip, including cutting off water supply, electricity and gas, closing all ports of entry, and bombing the Rafah port leading to Egypt, causing its infrastructure to not work properly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the local humanitarian crisis rapidly deepens, many United Nations agencies have issued stern warnings. Philippe Lazzari, head of UNRWA, said Gaza was &quot;rapidly turning into hell&quot; and on the verge of collapse. He urged all parties to &quot;put an end to this tragedy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 16, 2023, Xu Wei, spokesperson of the China International Development Cooperation Agency, said that China is providing emergency humanitarian assistance to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and the Palestinian Authority respectively. To solve the urgent needs of food, medical care, housing and other needs in the Gaza Strip. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a new round of conflict between Palestine and Israel continues, the number of casualties on both sides is also rising. As of October 15, local time, the conflict had killed more than 4,100 people on both sides. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Weijian, a researcher at the Foreign Policy Institute of the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, told Southern Weekend reporters that Israel&#39;s &quot;retaliatory actions&quot; will continue for a period of time. &quot;Hamas&#39; actions are humiliating to Israel, so Israel needs to get a psychological balance.&quot; He believes that Israel will use this power to eliminate Hamas on a regular basis. &quot;In fact, he is already doing this.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Urban Street Fighting&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;UNRWA&quot; intern Wu Chenyu on October 12 She received an email stating that &quot;11 staff members of the agency (Gaza office) were killed.&quot; Although she already knew the news, she still felt very sad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Chenyu is an intern at the agency’s Jordan office. She told Southern Weekend reporters that the agency’s headquarters manages five field offices, namely Lebanon, Gaza, the West Bank, Syria and Jordan. The Jordanian relief office where she works has not been affected by the war yet, &quot;but other field offices such as Gaza, staff have been informed to evacuate.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later on October 14, Hamas sent a message to Israel Rocket attacks were launched in Tel Aviv and surrounding areas, the central city of Bat Yam, the southern city of Ashkelon and other places. According to outside analysis, no one on either side of Palestine or Israel can predict exactly what will happen in the ground war. Hamas has proven that it can survive in previous Israeli-Palestinian conflicts and has &quot;powerful weapons suitable for street fighting.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Qassan Brigades, an armed faction affiliated with Hamas, released information to the Israeli military on the 14th that the organization was &quot;fully prepared&quot; for &quot;any ground military operations&quot; by the Israeli army. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Gaza Strip covers an area of ​​approximately 360 square kilometers, with dense population and numerous houses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, Hamas claimed to have built 500 kilometers of tunnels. Many experts and scholars believe that the tunnel network will make street fighting more difficult. Once the Israeli army and Hamas start &quot;urban street fighting&quot; there, both sides will suffer higher casualties than in the first few days of this round of Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and will have a negative impact on the Israeli army. pose a fatal threat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There are two levels in the Gaza Strip, one for civilians and the other for Hamas.&quot; An IDF spokesman said on October 12 that these tunnels are just &quot;bunkers for Hamas&quot; ” so that they can continue to plot cross-border operations and fire rockets into Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many media reports revealed that this &quot;maze-like huge underground tunnel network&quot; was built 30 meters underground in Gaza, with the entrance hidden on the ground floor of houses, schools and other public buildings. It is used for Hama Sri Lanka transports personnel, supplies, stores ammunition, etc., while avoiding Israeli artillery shells and reconnaissance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few days, Israel has continued to launch air strikes on Gaza. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But a week after the conflict broke out, Hamas was still able to fire rockets into Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The outside world believes that this is because the rockets hidden in the tunnels can be moved at any time. Saleh al-Arouri, one of the military leaders of Hamas, said before the outbreak of this round of Palestinian-Israeli conflict, &quot;Hamas&#39;s defensive plan is more powerful than its offensive plan.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;I don&#39;t think Israeli soldiers have the ability to attack these tunnels.&quot; Shaul, a Palestinian historian at Tel Aviv University&#39;s Middle East and African Studies Center, said, but Israel &quot;will find a way to smoke out Hamas.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Xiaolin, director of the Mediterranean Research Institute at Zhejiang University of International Studies, believes that Israel cannot and will not completely eliminate Hamas. He said that Hamas has grown from small to large, and there is no lack of &quot;contribution&quot; to Israel for allowing it to grow to fight against the mainstream faction of the PLO. Retaining the Gaza Strip as the so-called &quot;Hamastan&quot; can continue to divide, weaken, and internally divide the Palestinian camp and benefit Israeli strategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Revenge and scruples&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“I never imagined that this journey would be like this.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Have successfully returned from Israel Rao Pingman from China recalls her escape from Israel as if it was yesterday. After waiting for 15 hours at Tel Aviv Airport, Ms. Rao boarded a plane from Tel Aviv to Ethiopia on the morning of October 8, and then returned to China via the Ethiopia-Bangkok-Hong Kong route. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, in retaliation for Hamas, the Israeli army has launched multiple rounds of air strikes in the Gaza Strip. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Israel Defense Forces publicly stated on the afternoon of October 16 that the head of Hamas’s intelligence agency was killed in an assassination operation by the Israeli army. Currently, Hamas has no response. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Israel Defense Forces also stated in a statement that the Israeli army has completed the mobilization of hundreds of thousands of reservists, and the logistics department is working hard to ensure the supply of weapons and equipment for ground troops. He also stated that the equipment needed for the battle has been moved to the assembly area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a &quot;counterattack&quot; operation, Israel&#39;s actions can be called &quot;all-round&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 14, the Israel Defense Forces announced that it would implement a more extensive ground military action plan in the Gaza Strip and expand its offensive in the Gaza Strip, including launching &quot;joint and coordinated attacks by air, sea and land.&quot; Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu previously threatened that the Israeli army would &quot;destroy Hamas&quot; through a ground offensive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Israel Defense Forces stated that Israeli soldiers are preparing for &quot;major ground operations&quot; and that the Israeli army will implement an &quot;extensive ground offensive plan&quot; in the Gaza Strip to expand the offensive, including the implementation of &quot;air, sea and joint coordinated attack on land.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Weijian believes that Israel&#39;s mentality at this time is not determined to fight a &quot;win or lose&quot; battle, but that Israel believes that the losses suffered this time are too great, so Hamas must pay the price and double the price. revenge. &quot;Under this mentality, Israel will definitely do more in retaliation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the night of October 12 to the early morning of October 13, the Israeli army attacked about 750 Hamas and other organizations in the Gaza Strip. Air strikes were carried out against targets. These include tunnels, military compounds, residences used as military command centers for senior members, weapons warehouses, communications rooms and 12 buildings housing Hamas assets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the 11th, the day before that, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave a televised speech that night. He vowed to &quot;crush and destroy&quot; Hamas militants, saying that the Every member of the organization is a &quot;dead person.&quot; The Israeli army also attacked two Hamas military bases in the Gaza Strip. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In one of the compounds, the headquarters of the commander of Hamas&#39;s northern division was destroyed, and a military infrastructure building belonging to the Hamas naval unit was also attacked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Israel Defense Forces stated that since the Palestinian-Israeli conflict broke out on October 7, the Israeli army has arrested more than 330 Palestinians in the West Bank, including more than 100 people related to Hamas. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, many experts and scholars told Southern Weekend reporters that Israel&#39;s &quot;counterattack&quot; actions will not expand indefinitely. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Xiaolin judged that once the Gaza Strip, known as the &quot;hornet&#39;s nest&quot; and the &quot;damned strip&quot; by the Israelis, is included in the territory, Israel will once again bear a heavy burden of international law, morality, public opinion, economy, demographic structure and security. It will also put an end to the reconciliation process with Arab countries that has made significant progress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Israel also has many concerns.&quot; Li Weijian analyzed that if Israel excessively causes a humanitarian crisis or kills many civilians, it will eventually arouse the anger of the Arab world. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Hurt each other&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After Israel&#39;s &quot;evacuation order&quot; was issued, residents of northern Gaza began to flee to the south, looking for shelter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In videos circulating on social media, residents of Wuyangyang stuffed their belongings into pickup trucks and cars. Some residents had to squeeze onto flatbed trucks pulled by livestock and move with difficulty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some residents refused to leave and stayed in the collapsed and dilapidated houses. Speaking to the cameras, they said that while their homeland might be fraught with dangers, leaving would be &quot;turning back the land and history.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a new round of conflict broke out, Said Shoaib&#39;s family had to go from the Brei refugee camp near the Israeli border to the Deir al-Balah refugee camp. He continues to document it on social media. He said, &quot;There is no safe place in Gaza. Israel tells people to go to the south, but they are still bombing in the south.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under Israel&#39;s &quot;blockade&quot;, World Health Organization spokesperson Jassa Revi Qi said Gaza&#39;s hospitals were running out of medical supplies and beds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs released news on October 13, stating that since the outbreak of the new round of Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the number of displaced people in the Gaza Strip has exceeded 420,000. United Nations agencies have called for funds to provide aid to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meanwhile, the Israeli government released &quot;horrific photos of babies being killed and burned by Hamas monsters.&quot; The three photos were posted on the social media accounts of Netanyahu&#39;s office. But Hamas denies the accusations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Ran, who has now fled to Turkey, moved into the shelter of his school in Israel with his luggage when a new round of conflicts broke out. He told Southern Weekend reporters that the place has complete water, electricity and internet connections and is safer than other shelters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The battlefield is mainly concentrated in the south. In the central part where I am, except for a few thousand rockets on the first day, the number of rockets decreased thereafter, and even buses and trains were restored the next day.&quot; Yang Ran revealed , because Israelis may have one or two rocket attacks every year, they are &quot;relatively accustomed to it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The size of the economic damage to Israel will depend on how long these reservists are away from work.” Eyal Winter, an economics professor at Israel’s Hebrew University, said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the outbreak of the conflict, the Israel Defense Forces has called up many reservists to perform tasks. These reservists come from all walks of life. They are separated from daily economic production activities and go into battle. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;The quagmire of &quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Multi-front operations&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Currently, Israel has fully &quot;blocked&quot; Hamas-controlled areas In the Gaza Strip, water and electricity supplies were cut off. The move has the United Nations concerned about an exacerbation of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged all parties to allow the United Nations to provide humanitarian assistance to the Gaza Strip. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a United States that is &quot;busy on both sides&quot;, it has made frequent &quot;big moves&quot; since the Palestinian-Israeli conflict escalated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The U.S. White House announced on October 16 that after visiting Israel on October 18, U.S. President Biden will go to the Jordanian capital Amman to meet with Jordanian King Abdullah II and Egyptian President Sisi. Met with Palestinian President and Palestinian National Liberation Movement (Fatah) Chairman Mahmoud Abbas to discuss conflict-related matters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 14, US Secretary of Defense Austin ordered the &quot;Eisenhower&quot; aircraft carrier strike group to head to the Eastern Mediterranean. He said this was &quot;part of efforts to contain the expansion of the war.&quot; Biden publicly stated that the White House is quickly &quot;providing additional security assistance such as ammunition and missile interception systems&quot; to Israel. He urged the U.S. Congress to take urgent action to approve funds to meet the security needs of the United States&#39; &quot;key partners&quot; including Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The United States sends an aircraft carrier fleet to support Israel and deter Iran and Hezbollah, but it will not actively intervene in the Gaza war and create enemies on all sides in the Middle East, and it does not want to get stuck in the quagmire of the Middle East again.” Zhejiang International Studies University’s Mediterranean Research Ma Xiaolin, the dean of the hospital, said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this conflict, Iran, which was speculated to be a &quot;supporter&quot; of Hamas, held its first meeting with senior Hamas officials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of the 14th local time, Iranian Foreign Minister Abdullahiyan met with Hamas leader Haniyeh in Doha, the capital of Qatar. He called on Israel not to launch a ground attack on the Gaza Strip. He also warned that if the Lebanese Hezbollah joins the conflict, this round of conflicts may further expand to other regions in the Middle East, which will cause Israel to suffer huge losses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When will this cycle of violent fighting stop? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Marzouk, a member of the Hamas Political Bureau, said on October 10 that Hamas &quot;has achieved its goals&quot; and is open to discussing &quot;similar things&quot; and &quot;all political dialogue&quot; about a ceasefire. The Qatar Al Jazeera website reported that Hamas has captured a sufficient number of Israeli soldiers, but Hamas will only be willing to discuss the issue of prisoner exchange after the war is over. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is noteworthy that conflicts also broke out in the border areas between Israel and Lebanon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Lebanese National News Agency reported that on October 15, local time, Israel launched an artillery bombardment on the southern Lebanese border town of Al-Dhahira, causing complete disruption of public road traffic. It is generally believed that if the situation on the Lebanese-Israeli border escalates further, Israel may face a &quot;second front&quot; in the north. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Xiaolin said that the main battlefield of this conflict has been moved to the Gaza Strip. No matter how large the casualties are, the war will not spill over to the four countries of Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, and Syria. &quot;Coupled with the first phone call between the heads of state of Saudi Arabia and Iran to discuss the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, this shows that the regional identity politics game once led by both parties will not be repeated, and the Palestinian issue may continue to be marginalized.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Next, Israel will still take future development into consideration.&quot; Li Weijian analyzed that Israel has to deal with Middle Eastern countries and Arab countries, and it also hopes to maintain the situation it has finally opened and improve the development of relations with other countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mao Ning, spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, called on the top priority to cool down the situation, cease fire and violence, protect civilians, and avoid humanitarian disasters. When dealing with international and regional hot-spot issues, major countries should adhere to objectivity and fairness, maintain calmness and restraint. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(At the request of the interviewees, Rao Pingman and Yang Ran are pseudonyms)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 18 Oct 2023 15:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[今年前三季度中国GDP同比增长5.2%]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258794]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-18 14:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on the 18th showed that preliminary calculations showed that China’s gross domestic product (GDP) in the first three quarters ) 91.3027 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 5.2% at constant prices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at quarters, GDP grew by 4.5% year-on-year in the first quarter, 6.3% in the second quarter, and 4.9% in the third quarter. From a quarter-on-quarter perspective, GDP grew by 1.3% in the third quarter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sheng Laiyun, deputy director of the National Bureau of Statistics, said at a press conference of the State Council Information Office that day that in the first three quarters, faced with the complex and severe international environment and the arduous and arduous tasks of domestic reform, development and stability, various regions and departments Resolutely implement the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, focus on expanding domestic demand, boost confidence, and prevent risks, and the national economy continues to recover and improve. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The overall agricultural production situation is good, the recovery of industrial production is accelerating, and the service industry continues to recover rapidly. In the first three quarters, the added value of agriculture (planting industry) increased by 3.6% year-on-year; the added value of the national industrial enterprises above designated size increased by 4% year-on-year, 0.2 percentage points faster than the first half of the year; the added value of the service industry increased by 6% year-on-year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Market sales tend to be active, the scale of fixed asset investment continues to expand, and the import and export of goods are generally stable. In the first three quarters, the total retail sales of consumer goods reached 34,210.7 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 6.8%. National fixed asset investment (excluding rural households) increased by 3.1% year-on-year; excluding the impact of price factors, it increased by 6% year-on-year. The total import and export of goods was 30.8021 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 0.2%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consumer prices rose moderately, the employment situation was generally stable, and residents&#39; income grew steadily.

Ten days later, the information in the &quot;Leadership Introduction&quot; column of the National Bureau of Letters and Calls showed that Li Wenwen is currently the deputy minister of the Central Ministry of Social Work, the director of the Office of the Central Joint Conference on Letters and Calls, the director and the party secretary of the National Bureau of Letters and Calls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On March 16 this year, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the &quot;Plan for the Reform of Party and State Institutions&quot;. In terms of institutional reform of the Party Central Committee, five new &quot;Chinese-prefixed&quot; institutions including the Central Department of Social Work were established. Among them, the Central Ministry of Social Work is responsible for coordinating and guiding the people&#39;s petition work, guiding the collection of people&#39;s suggestions, coordinating and promoting party building to lead grassroots governance and grassroots political power building, unified leadership of the party work of national industry associations and chambers of commerce, and coordinating and promoting the deepening reform and transformation of industry associations and chambers of commerce.

Under the leadership of the Prime Minister, the Secretary-General is responsible for handling the daily work of the State Council, and the Deputy Secretary-General assists the Secretary-General in his work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It mentioned that “the General Office of the State Council must carefully review and review the official documents submitted by various regions and departments to the State Council for review and approval. It involves the issuance of administrative normative documents in the name of the State Council or the General Office of the State Council, If administrative normative documents are issued in the name of a department after being submitted to the State Council for approval, the judicial administrative department of the State Council shall conduct a legality review. For matters that have disagreements between departments, the leading comrades of the State Council in charge of the sponsoring department shall take the lead in strengthening coordination.

In China, almost no one knows his name, but his vague image is limited to a reformist politician, the author of &quot;Young China&quot;, and a father who raised many outstanding children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liang Qichao was born in Chakeng Village, Xinhui County, Guangzhou Prefecture in 1873. In &quot;Autobiography at Thirty&quot;, Liang Qichao used major events in Chinese and world history to find coordinates for the year of his birth: it was the tenth year after the fall of the Taiping Rebellion, one year after Zeng Guofan&#39;s death, and the third year after the Franco-Prussian War ended. Of course, when he was born, the chronology was the twelfth year of Tongzhi, Guiyou. The AD calendar was not widely adopted until the founding of New China. It was through Liang Qichao that the sayings of the 19th and 20th centuries spread in the Chinese-speaking world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liang Qichao was one of the first Chinese to realize the turn of the century. At the beginning of 1900, he wrote &quot;The Song of the Pacific in the Twentieth Century&quot;, predicting that the new century would usher in the Pacific Age. Chinese people in the 19th century did not realize that they were in the 19th century. Only in the 20th century will we look back with the help of new historical coordinates to describe this era of sinking, humiliation and endeavor, and salvation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1898, after the failure of the Hundred Days Reform, Liang Qichao went into exile in Japan and traveled around the world. After the founding of the Republic of China, Liang Qichao returned to China, and the main stages of his activities were in the ice drinking rooms in the capital Beijing and Tianjin. For him, his hometown in Guangdong has become as far away as his boyhood. But this does not mean that he bid farewell to his hometown. In fact, many of Liang Qichao&#39;s activities in Yokohama, Japan, North America and Australia relied on the huge support of the overseas Chinese network in Guangdong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/YH8F41xHIdF3FC0Vzqv5AIn8UTkKPK3nlVfGX4Ax.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;765&quot; height= &quot;1055&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/YH8F41xHIdF3FC0Vzqv5AIn8UTkKPK3nlVfGX4Ax.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254309&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Liang Qichao during his time in Japan. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If we focus on those people who have no names in history, we will find that from ten Since the middle of the ninth century, a large number of Cantonese have gone to North America and Japan. The use of steamships has enabled Cantonese expatriates to no longer just go to Southeast Asia, but to travel across the Pacific to all parts of the world.&quot; &quot;Regional Culture and National Identity: Late Professor Cheng Meibao, author of &quot;The Formation of Guangdong Cultural Concepts since the Qing Dynasty,&quot; told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;There are traces of Cantonese in every port on the Pacific coast. They have established guilds, temples, hometown associations in foreign countries, or organized themselves in the form of companies. , so when Kang Liang, Sun Yat-sen and others were active overseas, someone would contact them and arrange accommodation and itinerary. Behind the activities of these historical celebrities are decades of preparation by unknown groups.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;Many people have tried to write a biography of Liang Qichao. The historian Wu Qichang of the Republic of China wrote half of it until the Reform Movement of 1898; Xie Xizhang&#39;s &quot;Biography of Liang Qichao&quot; is divided into chapters based on Liang&#39;s interactions and relationships with different historical figures; the writer Wei Wei Before publishing the novel &quot;In the Misty Clouds&quot;, she spent several years writing a biography of Liang Qichao. When she had written more than 100,000 words, she felt that the thread was too complicated, so she put it down and started writing novels first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023 is the 150th anniversary of the birth of Liang Qichao, and the second part of Xu Zhiyuan&#39;s &quot;Liang Qichao&quot; has also been published. The first part is titled &quot;Young Revolutionary&quot;, about Liang Qichao from 1873 to 1898, and was published in 2019. Xu Zhiyuan originally planned to write it in three parts, but now the writing plan has been expanded to five parts. The second part, &quot;Desperation&quot;, was written from 1898 to 1903. The complex historical clues and the many characters who interacted with the Liang family made Xu Zhiyuan feel that, It is necessary to expand his version of Liang Qichao&#39;s biography. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Everyone is a contemporary.” This is how Xu Zhiyuan reminds his writing and the way each reader enters Liang Qichao’s world. Liang Qichao does not just belong to yesterday, maybe he also belongs to the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Luo Danni, the editor of the second part of &quot;Liang Qichao&quot; told Southern Weekend reporters: &quot;Xu Zhiyuan&#39;s writing context is different from that of historians and scholars, not in response to a problem in a specific academic history context, but out of A very pure curiosity about another person. It is curiosity about how another scholar, who is also in a period of unknown changes between the old and the new, faces the changes and participates in them. So his Writing is a kind of writing that empathizes with others and has a sense of empathy.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2023, a reporter from Southern Weekend conducted an exclusive interview with Xu Zhiyuan in a one-way space beside the Grand Canal in Hangzhou. Xu Zhiyuan is very busy. In addition to recording the program &quot;Thirteen Invitations&quot;, he is traveling to various cities to promote his new book. When a reporter asked how to balance Liang Qichao&#39;s ideological trajectory and social picture in the book, Xu Zhiyuan said: &quot;Sometimes I feel that there is too much about the era, and the era overwhelms the individual. Sometimes I feel that there is too much about the individual and lack of the era. Reflection, this is a process of constant searching.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/nlIotn1FEjTnSnyYbRhNNETePlneXvpjW1cgOyTs.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/nlIotn1FEjTnSnyYbRhNNETePlneXvpjW1cgOyTs.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254310 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In September 2023, Xu Zhiyuan talked about Liang Qichao in Hangzhou. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of Pumpkin Vision)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I especially hope to have an ideological adventure with the protagonist Liang Qichao, and you don&#39;t know What will happen next? I have only written the second volume so far. His thoughts are still evolving. I am not willing to use hindsight to evaluate whether his thoughts have matured. During that time, he had Such a state of mind. I want to go back to the historical scene as much as possible to create some possibility. The writing process of this set of books does not mean that I started after 20 years of research, careful consideration, and a lot of understanding about it. Putting pen to paper, no. My understanding will continue to deepen as I write. For example, when I write the second volume, I understand him better than the first volume. When I write the third volume, I may understand him better than the second volume. But it is also possible that when you finish writing the last volume, you will realize that your initial understanding of his thoughts was not accurate because it is a larger framework.&quot; Xu Zhiyuan told a reporter from Southern Weekend. In a sense, Liang Qichao&#39;s world is already Xu Zhiyuan&#39;s parallel universe. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Constructing Liang Qichao’s world like a puzzle&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;There have been some previous works that discussed Liang Qichao from the perspective of intellectual history, such as &quot;Liang Qichao and Modern Chinese Thought&quot; by American scholar Levinson, &quot;Liang Qichao and the Transition of Chinese Thought (1890-1907)&quot; by Zhang Hao, etc., and you The main interest in writing a biography of Liang Qichao is to describe the social transformation experienced by Liang Qichao&#39;s generation. What do you think is the main difference between the two kinds of writing? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhiyuan: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The books by Levinson and Zhang Hao were the first books that influenced my interest in Liang Qichao, and they were of great ideological enlightenment to me. . Levinson puts Liang Qichao in a larger context to view his role in Chinese tradition, covering his life in a short space. Mr. Zhang Hao&#39;s book mainly discusses Liang Qichao&#39;s ideological process before 1907. About ten years ago, I met Mr. Zhang Hao in Washington, USA. I went to his home as a guest and had a couple&#39;s lung slices together. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They are ideological biographies, and what I want to write is one that is more people-centered, literary, historical, and in a sense encyclopedic. Book. I spent a lot of pen and ink not only writing about Liang Qichao, but also his contemporaries, the spirit of the entire era behind him, the changes in China as a whole, the changes in Japan, and the changes in the world, so it is more like &quot;Liang Qichao and his era&quot; . I hope to regard Liang Qichao as a representative figure in the transformation process of global modernity. He belongs not only to the Chinese tradition, but also to the tradition of Asia and the world. Therefore, I want to describe the living space and scenes behind him. I wrote a lot about him as a doer. He is not only a thinker, but more importantly, a doer. I wanted to give him a more three-dimensional presentation using a modern biographical writing method. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;If we want to analyze his ideological trajectory more, we will add more discussion For this part, your writing method is to use historical data as much as possible and rarely discuss it. What is the reason for this? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhiyuan: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I try not to destroy the narrative rhythm. Whether the narrative has a sense of music or a logic, I try to follow the narrative itself. The structure, the characters gradually become fuller and more vivid on each page as each volume progresses. He has his own character, which I cannot completely control and regulate, and his character is made up of those realistic characters. It is composed of materials and perhaps some of my imagination in reorganizing materials. My subjectivity is completed in the preface. Once I enter the main text writing, I hope to hide my subjective emotions behind the words. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Reading the just-published second part of the biography of Liang Qichao When &quot;Desperation&quot; and &quot;Young Changemakers&quot; were published a few years ago, a large part of the reader&#39;s pleasure was that through your writing, you could build up a perception of the life experience of a part of the Chinese people more than a hundred years ago. For example, when scholars from Guangdong in the late Qing Dynasty went to Beijing to take exams, they took the sea route instead of land. They usually had to stop in Shanghai, so Shanghai naturally became a stage for their activities; for example, when they arrived in Beijing, they would stay in the hometown guild hall. What difficulties did you encounter when collecting these materials? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhiyuan: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When collecting materials, one is to imagine his living space. For example, Liang Qichao is often abstracted into a simple ideological figure. Of course this is also very important, but he not only lived in an ideological context, but also lived in a realistic context. He was not only a thinker, but also an important witness and participant of that era, so for me, It became very important to create the context of that era. Only by better understanding the background of that era can it be easier to understand the excellence and difficulty of his actions. So I spent a lot of energy to construct the space of the times, to understand how a scholar or a scholar went to Beijing to take the exam, and what the daily life of a scholar was like. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Only if you better understand the daily life of a scholar, for example, what kind of works he reads in Xuehaitang, will you understand the ideological context of his suddenly going to Japan and entering the Western context. Extraordinary. Therefore, I will describe the daily life of scholars, what it is like in Guangzhou and Beijing, and how to interact with people in the guild hall. I will rely on diaries and notes from that year, some records that seem to have nothing to do with Liang Qichao, to create a world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am very influenced by Shi Jingqian in this regard. You see when he wrote &quot;The Death of Wang&quot;, Wang did not have any records, but he used Pu Songling&#39;s novels to imagine what Shandong was like back then. The living atmosphere of the Qing Dynasty at that time. I also relied heavily on such notes and even novels at the time to construct such an atmosphere, including other candidates&#39; daily records. The second volume is to create a time and space of Tokyo, Yokohama, and Melbourne from the late 19th to the early 20th century. , but also to travel through this world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was young, I liked to read all kinds of miscellaneous books. This is the role of miscellaneous books. For example, I have read a lot of books on Australian history, and when I was writing, to describe Sydney in 1900, I had to collect a large amount of newspaper documents from that time, and probably only used a few strokes. What was the Australian overseas Chinese leader Mei Guangda like at that time? What is the situation of the Ye family in Vancouver? You need to go through all kinds of strange information, just like doing a puzzle, it may not be complete, try to put together as many pieces as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For example, if you write about the relationship between Liang Qichao and his wife, and how he There is very little information about a fruitless love affair in Hawaii. On the one hand, he is a precocious cultural star with social prestige that is not commensurate with his age. On the other hand, he seems to be a person who does not need an affair between his children and his wife. Don&#39;t travel with him or stay with him. Today&#39;s readers would have a hard time understanding this. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhiyuan: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It was a male-centered era. For these scholars who took the world as their own responsibility, although family was very important, it was often neglected by them. The narrative is ignored and few records are left. Including overseas Chinatowns, it is basically a male world. Except for overseas Chinese leaders who may bring their wives with them, most of their families stay in their hometowns in Guangdong and Fujian. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liang Qichao has been wandering around the world and has a huge emotional void. He will reveal his anxiety, loneliness and frustration in poetry. He wrote 24 love poems depicting Only when his strong feelings for Miss He are placed in such a time and space can his emotions be easily understood. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kang Youwei&#39;s emotions were even richer. He went into exile, married different wives, and had various affairs. The brother of Liang Qichao&#39;s wife was his examiner. This was a family that was kind to him. However, because of his actions, his wife and the whole family were involved in danger and panic. He felt a lot of guilt in it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Can we say that Liang Qichao is a relatively ascetic person? Zhang Hao&#39;s book talks about &quot;self-denial&quot;, and self-denial also includes the aspect of abstinence. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhiyuan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Liang Qichao is very emotional and very self-disciplined. His enthusiasm and desire have been greatly reflected in his actions and writing. display. If you think about it, he has written so many works and done so many things in a short period of time, ranging from political organizations to founding magazines, and covering everything from political economy to how to write novels. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The psychological motivations of many people constitute the driving force of history&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You say that Liang Qichao may be China&#39;s earliest global traveler, but Chinese literati have no habit of paying attention to details such as food, clothing, housing, transportation, customs, and landscapes during the journey.

I still need to read newspapers from that year to see how American and Australian history described the country and society at that time, mixed with Liang Qichao’s personal experiences and feelings, to form the world in his eyes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Before Liang Qichao, Huang Zunxian also followed his diplomacy Activities, living in Japan, the United States, and Singapore for a long time.

I was very happy to find a piece of material. When Liang Qichao gave a speech in Seattle, a Japanese student happened to record the grand occasion of everyone in the Chinese Theater enjoying Liang Qichao&#39;s speech. This description is very important to me. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another thing that interests me is the differences between the different Chinese worlds. For example, in Melbourne, San Francisco, and Vancouver, the Chinese communities in each city have their own characteristics, and these characteristics will also be reflected in their attitudes towards exiles. Including the divisions and tensions within Chinese society, what wealthy businessmen want to gain from the Royalist Society, and what ordinary people want to gain.

The sense of time is all relative. For them, taking a boat from Yokohama to Hawaii in 10 days is already very fast. Liang Qichao experienced an era when the earth suddenly shrunk and accelerated. He was able to travel to many different states and countries in such a short period of time. This was a brand new experience.时间感的变化、现代性的变化，对梁启超思想的形成是非常重要的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;今天的读者要理解梁启超那个时代，最大的隔膜和困难在什么地方？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我觉得对日常生活的理解可能还没有那么难，毕竟日常生活的节奏虽然有差异，但也没有那么难把握。他的思想变化是非常难理解的，他要突然从一个四书五经的，或者仅仅从《万国公报》上看到外部世界的只言片语的一个年轻人，进入明治晚期的日本，面对那么多不同的思想的冲击，从社会达尔文主义到自由主义、君主立宪，还有小说、科学、经济学，所有这些东西涌来，他怎么去理解这样一个世界的新，那种思想的爆炸。当然我们现在也处在一个技术巨变的时代，有很多陌生的名词不知道，但是我们毕竟受过一些现代教育的训练，至少这些新的变化是沿着现代教育的基础和脉络进行的，梁启超他们受的是传统教育，这种巨大冲击的思想感受，是很难去描述的一个过程。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就像你受的是牛顿力学的训练，突然把你扔进量子力学的世界，那是怎样一种感觉？我们在描绘这样的思想变化的时候，不能都是后见之明，认为那些名词已经是固定的常识了，那些名词本身是梁启超他们创造出来的，通过对日语的翻译，琢磨这个新词是不是可用的，甚至是来不及想太多就要赶紧开始使用了，要给别人讲述，我觉得那是非常慌乱的过程。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;写梁启超传，一个很大的悖论或挑战是，今天我们中国人运用的很多观念、词汇，本来是经由梁启超创造的，却要用他创造的词像“咬尾蛇”一样去复述他。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;所以怎么回到当时的陌生感是一个问题，我希望描绘思想变化的过程，不是已经固化的思想本身。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;换句话说，除了“同时代性”，我们与一百多年前，也存在文明范式的巨大差异，这个差异首先就体现在我们的教育、我们与传统的关系上。或许呈现这种细微又无处不在的差异，是一个巨大的挑战？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;必须要运用一些想象力和同理心。当然，想象力有它的局限，在写作过程中，误读是一定会发生的。可能误读本身也是历史给我们的很重要的一个动力。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;在2023年写梁启超传，它一定是2023年的人写的。到了2053年，可以有另外的人去写。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;一定是带着这一代人的问题意识，包括选择什么资料，一定是触发了你此刻的心情的材料，才会选择它。所以它带着强烈的当下性，有点像翻译。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;有一种翻译的观念就是说，文学经典应当每隔五十年重译一次，每次重译，一定是使用这个时代的文学语汇、日常语言。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;对梁启超这样的人物，他确实应该不断地被重新书写。不光是梁启超，严复、蔡元培这些现代中国之父，都值得每一代人重新书写。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;回到梁启超是我们的同时代人这种说法，我们今天援引梁启超也好，回到鲁迅也好，都是在回应当下我们对许多问题没有答案的一种困境？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;思想需要历史的维度，如果没有历史的维度，你的思想会非常轻飘或者说无根。所以写作它的时候，当然是对当下的某种回应，同时也是为当下的问题寻找某种历史的脉络和框架。在这个历史的框架之中，你就更容易理解当下的感受。对我来说，所有的时空都是交错的，其实梁启超的影响并没有消失，它仍然弥漫在我们的生活里。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;中国应该有一种综合思想性和文学性的历史写作&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;梁启超面对巨变和各种棘手的思想难题的抉择，给了你哪些启发？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;没有机会深思熟虑，每个人都要在一个信息不充分的情况下展开行动。我喜欢他身上那种行动的精神。行动也是一种思想方式，行动会不断确认思想的局限性和可能性。梁启超对我最强的触动，就是让行动来验证或者拓展思想。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;梁启超会比较推崇王阳明，而不是朱熹。梁启超觉得王阳明的知行合一的精神，对日本江户末期到明治维新的变革者产生了巨大的影响。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;因为王阳明是对个人主体性的一种释放。然后个人能够进行自我塑造，这种能力是非常大的，可以直接影响环境与时代，鼓舞很多胸怀大志的人。梁启超肯定深受此影响，因为他在一个流亡的状态，一切都充满不确定，个人的能动性就变得至关重要。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;梁启超是一个学者、媒体工作者，也是一个教育家、作者，他的哪一种身份最吸引你？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;对，还有个身份是政治家。我觉得他首先是一个书写者，他的其他行动都在不断地展开，那些角色对他也非常重要，但写作者是能最充分地展现他的一切、施展他的才能的一个角色。梁启超是百科全书派的写作者，一个转型时代的启蒙思想家，他的写作就像日本的福泽谕吉，或者法国启蒙运动时期的伏尔泰、卢梭、狄德罗，触及方方面面，可以用文字发挥很直接的政治和社会的影响力。他的时代也在经历中国各种现代学科形成的过程，梁启超卷入其中，然后他又有中国文人士大夫的那种风采，在这样一个过渡时代，他的写作是非常混杂的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你有很多媒体工作经历，会对梁启超编报刊杂志特别感兴趣吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;写一本传记，传主当然会潜移默化影响你。梁启超和我隔了一百年，他是1873出生，我是1976年，可能会有一种潜意识的呼应。但我更感兴趣的，是从19世纪到20世纪，中国剧烈转型、进入现代世界的过程中，梁启超是一个精神世界的代表，他广泛的社会参与也提供了样本的丰富性。接下来我还想写李鸿章的传记，他的性格和经历跟我就完全不一样了，我希望描述那个历史舞台，19世纪中国进入世界舞台过程中的困境，以及个人的失败。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;梁启超是19世纪到20世纪的桥梁，李鸿章是中国19世纪的挽歌。你主编过《东方历史评论》，《东方历史评论》很关注中国与周边的历史、中国海外移民，写近代历史人物的传记，也是这种兴趣的延伸吧？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;写完梁启超传、李鸿章传，我还想写林语堂传，他们三个人分别代表了中国人的power（权力）、idea（观念）、identity（身份），估计可以写到八十岁了。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我一直很喜欢这样一个杂志的样式，介于学院和大众媒体之间的载体，非常有可读性，但背后有很强的学术背景，题材也非常广泛。我对历史一直有强烈的热情，受史景迁的影响，我觉得应该有一种综合思想性和文学性的历史写作。历史和传记写作应该是我们的一种非常重要的知识成果。有的时代是诗歌的时代，有的时代是小说的时代，有的时代可能是散文或旅行写作的时代，我希望还有一些时代是属于历史和传记写作的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你说在日本开单向空间，也是写梁启超传的副产品，在外国开书店有哪些困难？尤其日本是一个书店和出版业很发达、自成体系的国家。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;说副产品其实是开玩笑，我是2020年因为疫情困在日本，就想做点事情，结果我在东京的房东成了书店的合伙人。日本书店虽然很多，但是没有很好的当代的中文书店，东京的单向空间百分之七十是中文书，然后也有日文、英文、韩文书，所以它也是一个亚洲书店的概念。就像中国的单向一样，它会提供沙龙活动，是个交流的场所。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;困难当然也不少，在银座找个地方是很不容易的，成本也相对高，它的商业逻辑我也还没想清楚。中国的单向空间，我们是品牌的输出和管理方，不是靠零售来盈利，更像一个综合意义上的文化公司。在东京不是这种商业逻辑，还要看能不能持续支撑下去，所以它是一个很鲁莽的产物。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;清末民国的书店往往兼有出版的功能，也是一个新信息的集散中心，你有通过单向空间呼应这一传统的考虑吗？在当下的移动互联网时代，书店扮演了什么特殊的角色？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;书店不仅是知识储存的物理空间，也是人员聚合、知识流动、观念生产的地方，它其实是一个精神的公共体，社区的支持很重要。我们东京店就在推一个会员计划，希望会员能找到共同体的感觉。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;某种意义上说，图书和纸媒已经被称为夕阳行业，你在流媒体上做的《十三邀》，更有对应于梁启超时代的新媒体的属性，你怎么看待这两者对你不同的意义？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;其实它们本质上并没有那么大的区别，都是思想的表达。当然不同的媒介有不同媒介的特性，比如书写是更古老的一个媒介，它跟我个人内心，跟我的思想有更密切的关系。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;拍视频是团队的产物，它能够表现我的某一部分，但经常是集体的表达。公司也是，在公司我就是其中的一个创始人或者是灵魂人物，但它的整个运转经常超出我的控制范围，甚至是个逐渐失控的过程。写书是能够自己控制的行为。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对中国的士大夫来说，可能就自己印一些诗文集，所以到了梁启超那代人，杂志、报纸就是他们的超级新媒体，每十天就能出一期新的，有上万人可以看到，这种冲击是非常直接的，很快形成一个共振效应。梁启超大部分文章是在报纸、杂志上发表，真的就像现在做直播和视频一样。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;而且梁启超也面临了失控的情况，比如跟汪康年产生矛盾等等。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;对，然后他又被会计骗了，集资也不顺利。他也要考虑经营的问题、营收的压力，给股东派息，要面对印刷厂起火了怎么办。大家往往忽略了一点，梁启超是个连续创业者，办完《清议报》办《新民丛报》，然后又办《新小说》、广智书局，而且他都找到了投资，以编辑和主笔的身份，占二到四成股份。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;梁启超主要是一个写作者和编辑，你除了内容产出，还有许多商业活动，你会对这些活动对精力的占用感到困扰吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;有时候当然会分散精力，但有时候也是相互促进，因为当你拍节目或者去参与公司的很多事情的时候，经常会挫败，涣散，当然也很兴奋，但是当你写作的时候，就回到更专注的自我，我觉得那是对其他生活的躲避和回避，而你在日常生活面对的一些混乱和失控，也可以把它带到书里，帮你更好地理解梁启超的世界。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;一些历史材料受到了怀疑，我尽量把这种怀疑也呈现出来&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;梁启超通过他大量的写作，创造了一种新的语体，我们现在的文法和语言风格则受到了大量外国译作的影响。有人说你的写作是“翻译体”，你怎么看待这个问题？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我们这代人都受翻译很大的影响，读的很多书是翻译过来的，而且会感到翻译的文体的新颖性。其实梁启超也是翻译体，受到很多日本的影响。更别说五四时期，鲁迅等人的语言。我们白话文的语感就是在翻译的影响下产生的，而且我觉得已经找不到一个纯粹的不受外来语影响的文体。其实最重要的是，你能不能从中找到阅读的快感。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你是一个经验丰富的媒体写作者，非常注重公共写作的可读性，但是写作梁启超传需要参考大量的学术著作和史料。你会不会担心，对于普通读者来说，你的梁启超传太艰涩，对于学界来说，信息密度又不够？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;对学者来说，信息密度也是非常大的。你看我们出版的各种论文，很多也没多大的信息密度。我写梁启超传，用了非常多的新材料，但是我希望它同时有很强的可读性。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;有一些史料，比如冯自由的《革命逸史》，它的可靠性受到了学界的很多质疑，但冯自由的演绎又是很有戏剧性的。对待这一类史料，你是怎么处理的？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;有一些历史材料受到了怀疑，我尽量把它受到的怀疑也呈现出来。尽管冯自由的很多东西有道听途说的成分，但当时很多史料都是道听途说的，甚至说不那么确切的材料，也是构成那个时代场域的重要部分。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;关于梁启超的传说，或者他的同代人的很多传说，也是当时的史料，并没有一个完全纯然的hard fact，就像今天我们俩在这谈话，这中间很多信息在产生，但它并不一定是准确的信息。所以我觉得，要理解历史的这种多样性，对材料本身的引用和怀疑，你给它一个展开的空间，读者自己会感受到的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;梁启超认为，20世纪是民族帝国主义的时代，他后来的思想有浓重的社会达尔文主义的色彩，如何看待他的这种思想倾向对后世产生的影响？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我觉得每一代人要解决每一代人的问题，我们不能要求一代人解决100年之后的问题，有的先知者会看到他的困境是什么，但是对于梁启超那代人来讲，他面临的现实是国家受到羞辱，进入历史的谷底，富强是他们最重要的目标，而他们认为现代民族国家是参与全球竞争的最重要的一种角色，所以他们要去塑造一个现代的民族国家。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;至于它的内在矛盾性，它可能产生的一种压迫性，是逐渐发展出来的，章太炎对这个问题更敏锐。梁启超可能也感受到这部分，但他有他的迫切性，每个思想家的特质是不一样的，所以我们无法去要求每一个思想者既做出迫切的选择，又有长远的观照。韦伯看到了更长远的东西，看到现代性作为铁笼子的一面，他就是更伟大的一个思想家。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然我觉得思想者只能负思想者的责任。历史上一个思想观念的形成，它对我们的影响，不仅来自思想家本身，还来自后来的社会和教育体制的塑造。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;梁启超徘徊于中国的传统文化与西方的知识之间，他的后代也多是考古、航天等领域的专家，而在今天，我们的困境却是学科太过专门化、辖域化，梁启超式的综合性的人文知识分子越来越缺乏。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;随着学科的细分，那种纵横式的思想者，不仅中国，全世界都稀缺。可能当时代发生新的巨大变化，大家就渴望综合性的思想者出现。比如说为什么全球这么多人要读赫拉利的作品，它谈不上多么伟大或深刻，但他具有某种综合性，他对眼前迫切性的问题提出了自己的某种回应，这种回应就会引起大量的注意。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;在大众认知中，梁启超是一个被高度窄化的人，今年是他150周年诞辰，梁启超传当然也是改变公众对他的认识的一个重要努力。你觉得在他卷帙浩繁的著述中，有哪些是最值得被今天的读者阅读的？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;梁启超写了1400万字，非常庞杂，他的经历和作品一样重要。他的思想史著作，关于清代学术三百年，还有《少年中国说》《新民说》这些散文，都值得被不断重读。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;与梁启超相比，大众对鲁迅作品的阅读就要全面得多。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;20世纪是一个革命的世纪，鲁迅是作为一个革命作家被铭记的。梁启超长期以来被认为是维新力量的代表，而维新是被革命叙事所压抑的。其实，在梁启超的时代，他是一位国民作家，从比他年长的人，到他的同代人，再到下一代的陈独秀、毛泽东、胡适，所有人都在读他。此外，梁启超的写作还处在文体转化的过程中，而鲁迅他们已经探索出一种新的白话文的写作方式了。其实，被窄化的不光是梁启超，我们对蔡元培、林语堂的认识也还远远不够，所以我觉得应该有更多写作者加入到重估和重新发现他们的工作中。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;身兼数职的叶刘淑仪，仍然在政坛上，书写风云。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（姚忆江/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;接受南方周末专访前，叶刘淑仪递过来四张名片，头衔分别是“立法会议员”“新民党主席”“香港行政会议非官守议员召集人”“海上丝绸之路协会联席主席”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些身份占据了她的大多数时间。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为立法会议员，叶刘淑仪在在议会上质询官员时，官员称都要“打起十二分精神”。因为官员面对的，是一位曾经在政府体制中摸爬滚打了几十年的前高官，对香港情况了如指掌。作为香港新民党主席，叶刘淑仪曾称要推动香港发展优质民主，竭力为香港市民服务。繁忙的事务、频繁的曝光率，身兼数职的叶刘淑仪，仍然在政坛上，书写风云。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，对这位香港特区首位出掌纪律部门的女性，人们评价褒贬不一。支持她的人认为，她担任香港保安局局长期间，在《公安条例》争议、居港权问题、入境事务大楼纵火案等多起事件中处事果断、作风硬朗和建树良多，是不可多得的“香港铁娘子”。但也正是这种硬朗作风，引来不少反对的声音。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她还曾在2012年和2016年两次宣布参选香港特首。虽然都以惜败告终，但参选口号“赢返香港”依然让不少港人为之振奋。参选过程中，叶刘淑仪一再强调“如果当选，将率先处理香港核心管治问题”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她如何看待香港在海上丝绸之路上的独特作用，对香港的发展又有怎样的期待？ &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;串起&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;全球&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;“朋友圈”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;香港作为海上丝绸之路联盟城市之一，具有地理优势。香港该如何利用海上丝绸之路促进香港经济的发展，串起“朋友圈”？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;叶刘淑仪：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我创办的海上丝绸之路协会是在2015 年成立的，是共建“一带一路”倡议提出后最早回应倡议的香港组织。丝绸之路是中国很重要的品牌，也是个全球的品牌。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其实中国是最早推动全球化，对外开放的。张骞通西域是一次伟大的远征，搭建起了连接世界的桥梁。香港的地理位置在南方，也是海上丝绸之路一个非常重要的节点。历史上，自中国出海的中国商船，或回航的蕃舶，多会待冬季东北风发之便，经香港屯门出海，南驶中南半岛及南洋群岛，再到印度及波斯湾等地。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;丝绸之路就是一个非常重要的文化符号，应该多利用软力量向年轻人推广。比如我们安排免费的电影如《大唐玄奘》给观众欣赏，讲述商人把中国的蚕桑带到西域，也把西域一些葡萄产品带到中国这种交流的历史。利用这种软力量，帮助香港年轻人理解中国伟大的发展历史，以及深厚的文化底蕴。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;香港社会还有一个特色，就是很多华侨，包括很多东南亚的大家族在香港都有分支。香港跟东南亚的关系非常好。比如菲律宾大部分是福建人，新加坡有福建、潮州客家人，泰国也是很多潮州人，商业的来往非常频密。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以我觉得我们应该成立一个协会、联盟，连结海丝会沿岸的省市以及东南亚的国家。创办的时候，希望能在人心相通方面多做工夫，也希望能够教育香港年轻人多理解中国伟大的历史文化。所以协会部分重要的活动，都会安排一些年轻的大学生去海丝地区的国家走走。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;这就是“张骞计划”吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;叶刘淑仪：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;对，学习当年张骞勇敢的开创精神。我们成立的时候，荷兰商会的会长很感兴趣，“一带一路”的终点是欧洲的鹿特丹，所以他也有兴趣加入。我们还安排了大学生到内地的广西、广东，以及东南亚的国家，如泰国、马来西亚、新加坡。另外还去了东非吉布提、欧洲伦敦。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;值得一提的是，应希腊一个小岛的邀请，我们安排了负责中国文化的老师暑期到希腊宣传中国文化，教中文，也很受欢迎。但是疫情原因，停滞了三年，今年我们又重新启动，也得到很多企业的支持。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;这个计划最高的时候派了一百个学生出去。今年大致有多少人？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;叶刘淑仪：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;今年也起码有一百人了。因为陆陆续续有很多的中外企业参与支持，让大学生有机会去学习、实习，开阔眼界。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;叶刘淑仪：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;李特首已经举行了上任以后第一次的粤港研习会议，其中加强科技、金融，人才的交流，文化的加强和交流也非常重要。澳门是海上丝绸之路的一部分，我们也想跟澳门加强合作。同时，希望将来安排多点学生去大湾区学习考察、加深他们对岭南文化的理解。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;现在香港学生对海上丝绸之路的文化，包括中国传统文化的熟悉程度和理解，达到什么样的程度?&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;叶刘淑仪:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我觉得比较遗憾的，是香港的教改。 2009年推出的教改，我觉得走错了路，就好像台湾一样，把中国文化的元素大大减少。因为中史不是必修课，五万多个高考生只有五千人学习中史，学习世界史更少于五千人，学习中国文化典籍的考生只有两千人。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我本身是念英国人的学校，但我小时候也念过很多的典籍，包括《经史子集》都读过一点点，现在的学生大部分都没有接触过。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们安排了内地春节期间热映的《满江红》给年轻人免费观赏，但是他们不知道故事是发生在什么样的历史背景下，反响也一般。所以我觉得是教育出了问题，但现在已经加强中国历史典籍的教育传授，加强中史以及国情教育的传授，这些具有非常重要的意义。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“香港未来的前途跟中国密不可分”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;作为汇贤智库的负责人，也是海上丝绸之路协会的负责人，同时还是立法委员，也曾担任保安局局长。通过综合身份，你怎么看香港的未来？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;叶刘淑仪：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;很多香港人都不明白，但也越来越多人在明白、觉醒。其实二十多年前，香港还没有回归祖国时，新加坡总理李光耀来香港考察时说，“香港未来的前途跟中国密不可分。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;确实，香港跟国家是风雨同路的。所以我们也很感谢国家不断地支持香港，香港今天稳定安全的局面得来不易。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，虽然《国安法》平息了2019年的骚乱，但是仍然有一些敌对的势力在香港蠢蠢欲动，所以还需要提高警惕。香港还没有为《基本法23条》立法，而澳门已经在2009年完成了这项工作。所以李特首已经表态，这是一个非常重要且需要优先的工作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你怎么看待香港的危机和机遇?&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;叶刘淑仪：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;中国有五千多年历史，国家有非常古老的一面，也有非常现代先进的一面。比如有部电影《流浪地球》，就充分地表现了中国在科技方面的发展，包括航天方面的不凡成就。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们要向香港年轻人多介绍中国各方面的成就。现在香港有故宫文化博物馆，是一个非常重要的传播载体。另外，香港也举办了如“三星堆”展览，我希望将来能有多一点中国现代化方面的成就在香港展示。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其实内地文化软力量很厉害。现在很多年轻人包括一些在外国留学的年轻人，也非常喜欢看内地的电视剧，内地的偶像顶流在香港也有市场，而且他们的水平很高。比较现代化的街舞等表演在香港很受年轻人的欢迎，我也希望香港的文化表演团体，能有机会到内地演出。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我听说今年过春节时，有一部非常卖座的电影《毒舌律师》是律政片，在内地很受欢迎，所以期待将来香港与内地能在文化方面多点交流。香港是个中西文化交流的中心，我希望未来在这方面，无论是新民党、海上丝绸之路协会，都能为此多做一点贡献。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;叶刘淑仪：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;新民党于2011年1月9日在香港正式举行成立典礼，当时只有我一位议员。但在2021年的大选中，我们赢了3个议席，又在2022年的补选中多赢了一个议席。所以新民党现在已经有6位立法会议员，1位区议员。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不同的政党都有不同的代表性。当年创党，是因为我觉得香港有一大部分的市民如中产阶级的市民、在国外接受教育的市民，以及思想比较西化的市民，他们都很爱国爱港，但没有党派为他们发声。所以新民党吸纳这些人员，教育水平也都比较高。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我跟黎栋国（前保安局局长）是前官，所以我俩有很多公务员支持，包括纪律部队；容海恩议员是一位大律师；李梓敬在美国受过高等教育；陈家珮由地区直选。 2022年补选的、赢得一席的何敬康是澳门原特首何厚铧先生的侄儿，他可以协助我们加强跟澳门的联系，而且他也是留英留美的，非常理解西方的文化价值，有助香港发挥“中介人”“超级联络人”的作用。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;香港特区政府成立以后，你是首位女性保安局局长，现任特首李家超也是保安局局长出身。你们之间有没有怎样的交流与合作？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;叶刘淑仪：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我跟李家超特首的交往很有趣。我当香港保安局局长时，李家超是有组织及严重罪案调查科的主管，当时他的外号就是“神探”，因为其心思非常缜密。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;无论他当保安局局长还是当特首，我也跟他合作得很好。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在立法会发言前，我会询问李家超一些材料，形成工作默契，为现在的工作配合打下基础。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李特首有一个非常好的本领，他很愿意夸奖他的下属。工作表现好的时候，很愿意表扬他们，肯定其贡献。而且他能团结公务员、议员、行政会议成员。所以李特首上任之后，我们的氛围很好。我觉得2023 年真的是香港随着国家经济复苏，值得拼搏的一年。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;

&lt;p>;Releasing animals is a &quot;good deed&quot; in both Buddhism and Taoism. The Buddhist &quot;Brahma Net Sutra&quot; says, &quot;Buddhas should practice the act of releasing lives with compassion... If you see people killing animals in the world, you should rescue them and relieve their suffering.&quot; Taoist classics also include &quot;The Essay on Release of Life&quot; and &quot;The Seven Precepts on Killing.&quot; ” and other scriptures advising people not to kill but to release lives. There are many believers in Buddhism and Taoism in China, so there have been more and more releases of animals in recent years. However, unscientific and blind release will not only fail to bring benefits to the animals being released, but may also cause ecological disasters. It is necessary to regulate release activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The release management regulations formulated by the Guangzhou Municipal People&#39;s Congress first stipulate that the release of all exotic species is prohibited, and lists the alligator gar, leopard catfish (commonly known as &quot;scavenger fish&quot;), Qi&#39;s Key species include tilapia, freshwater white pomfret, mosquito fish, Egyptian frogfish, Thai dace, giant snapping turtle, red-eared turtle (commonly known as Brazilian turtle), and American bullfrog. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The release of these exotic wild animals may pose serious threats to native organisms. For example, the alligator gar is a ferocious carnivorous fish with a huge adult size, up to 3 meters. It is said that one can eat all the fish in a lake, and can even bite people. The alligator gar is native to southern North America, but in recent years it has appeared in many places across the country. This kind of fish has almost no natural enemies in domestic waters. Once it overflows in the wild, the consequences will be disastrous. Ruzhou Central Park in Henan once drained 200,000 cubic meters of lake water just to catch an alligator gar. Exotic species such as tilapia and scavengers will also seriously squeeze the living space of native organisms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is probably not &quot;good&quot; to release one kind of animal, but bring disaster to other animals or even the entire ecology. In fact, the unauthorized release of alien species has been clearly defined as illegal or even criminal. The &quot;Biosecurity Law&quot; that took effect on April 15, 2021 stipulates that anyone who releases or discards alien species without approval shall be ordered to capture or retrieve the released or discarded alien species within a time limit, and shall be fined not less than RMB 10,000 but not more than RMB 50,000. fine. The Criminal Law Amendment (11), which took effect on March 1, 2021, stipulates that those who illegally introduce, release or discard invasive alien species, if the circumstances are serious, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years or criminal detention, and shall also or solely be fined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although some species are not from outside the country, releasing them into inappropriate locations may be counterproductive. China has a vast territory and many places have their own unique ecosystems. Species native to one place may not be able to adapt to the environment and die in other places. For example, fish that are suitable for living in warm waters will freeze to death in northern winter. Blindly releasing animals into an environment that is not suitable for their survival will not only make these animals unable to &quot;live&quot;, but will accelerate their death. Some people even take freshwater fish to the sea and release them. This is not releasing them, but killing them. The death of a large number of released animals will also cause environmental pollution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is also a possibility that native species in one place may become &quot;invasive species&quot; in another place, destroying the local native ecology. Such species from other ecosystems within the territory are essentially invasive alien species to the native ecology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, Guangzhou’s release management regulations require that wild animals suitable for survival in the wild at the release site should be selected, and the number of releases should be strictly controlled without causing harm to the ecosystem. Regulations also require management departments to develop and publish a list of native wildlife suitable for release, from which the public can select species for release. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the choice of species, the release site is also important. Inappropriate release locations, in addition to the possibility that the released animals cannot survive, may also bring danger to humans, such as releasing ferocious and poisonous animals in areas close to human activities. Some people once released venomous snakes and crocodiles in the park, and electric rays and moray eels on the beach, which seriously threatened the personal safety of tourists. To this end, Guangzhou’s release management regulations require the management department to delineate and announce areas suitable for release, and prohibit release outside the release area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The regulations also stipulate the consequences of illegal release. Those who release wild animal exotic species shall be punished in accordance with the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Law; those who release wild animals in places other than the release area shall be fined not less than 2,000 yuan but not more than 10,000 yuan; those who may cause damage to the ecological environment shall be ordered to capture them within a time limit. If damage has been caused, a fine of not less than RMB 10,000 but not more than RMB 100,000 shall be imposed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Releasing animals is &quot;good&quot; in religious concepts. However, blind release may not be a good thing, and may even cause serious harm to the released animals themselves, other creatures, the ecological environment, and people. In that case, it is not doing good, but doing evil. It is necessary to regulate the release of animals. Publicity should be strengthened to popularize the knowledge of scientific release, and law enforcement should be strengthened to punish illegal release behaviors to avoid serious damage caused by blind release. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 18 Oct 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一位34岁的也门人，在三亚开了两家“万亿级”公司]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258780]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-18 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/17/Wm2jjWukGfmx50lErAsIuDMgTiDL8oeQrW33PL1X.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/Wm2jjWukGfmx50lErAsIuDMgTiDL8oeQr W33PL1X. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254328&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Sanya city scenery. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Four &quot;Big Mac&quot; companies have emerged in Sanya, with registered capitals of up to 950 billion euros (approximately 7 trillion yuan), far exceeding Hainan Province’s GDP in 2022 (681.822 billion yuan). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System, these four companies are: Brand New Concept (Sanya) Investment Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Brand New Concept), Wansheng Zhaoye (Sanya) Investment Group Co., Ltd.

For example, their shareholders are all overseas companies, but their registered capital is small. After the equity penetration, the controlling shareholder of the two companies is the same, a Yemeni living in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Main investment&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to the national enterprise credit information disclosure system, New Concept, Wansheng Zhaoye, Lianou Honghan, and Minhong Technology were established respectively On September 25, 2023, October 7, 2023, October 8, 2023, October 8, 2023. The business scope of the four companies includes &quot;investment activities with self-owned funds; asset management services for self-owned fund investment; venture capital investment (limited to investment in unlisted companies).&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Yuchen, director of Beijing Jinliu Law Firm, told Southern Weekend reporters that a company&#39;s high registered capital can improve the company&#39;s credibility to a certain extent and show that the company has relatively strong economic strength, which is conducive to attracting investment. investors and customers. Secondly, companies with high registered capital will have certain advantages when participating in some large-scale projects, bidding and other activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Wang Yuchen also pointed out that if the registered capital is too high, there will be certain legal risks. First of all, if the registered capital is falsely high but the actual operating capabilities are not strong, it may cause the company&#39;s financial situation to be strained and affect the company&#39;s normal operations. Secondly, it will increase the risks for shareholders. For example, if the actual capital contribution is not made in accordance with the commitment of subscribed capital, the relevant shareholders may bear corresponding liabilities within the scope of subscribed capital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He believes that when a company sets its registered capital, it should based on its actual situation, taking into account not only the need to improve the company&#39;s credibility, but also its own financial affordability, and avoid falsely reporting registered capital. legal risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to having similar registration times, the four companies have the same registered addresses, all located on the 10th floor of the Glory Century Building, Yingbin Road, Jiyang District, Sanya City, Hainan Province. According to the Hainan Free Trade Port Investment and Talent Promotion Network, the Glory Century Building is a commercial office building with a total area of ​​20,000 square meters.

At what age is it easy for a child to get it? Can adults get it too? Let me reveal the secrets of Mycoplasma pneumoniae one by one! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/bddf3c3d344dfbd96d0d82199ddeb4b5.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;494&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/bddf3c3d344dfbd96d0d82199ddeb4b5.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254305&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;01&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;What is Mycoplasma pneumoniae? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Mycoplasma pneumoniae is the smallest microorganism known in the world that can survive independently, between bacteria and viruses. Mycoplasma pneumoniae has no cell wall structure, like bacteria without a &quot;coat&quot;. Both 75% alcohol and chlorine-containing disinfectant (such as 84 disinfectant) can kill Mycoplasma pneumoniae. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/477dce0e66baefc1fe83bdbeb2bd445b.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;626&quot; height=&quot;358&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/477dce0e66baefc1fe83bdbeb2bd445b.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254303&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;Mycoplasma pneumoniae is an important pathogen of acute respiratory infections in Beijing. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is divided into two subtypes, type I and type II. Currently, type I is the main prevalent subtype in Beijing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The population is generally susceptible to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, but it is more common in children and adolescents over 5 years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection can occur throughout the year. The high incidence period of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in Beijing is from August to December every year, and usually reaches its peak around November every year. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;02&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;How is Mycoplasma pneumoniae spread? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Patients with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection and asymptomatic infections are the main sources of infection. The incubation period is 1 to 3 weeks, and they are infectious during the incubation period until symptoms subside for several weeks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mycoplasma pneumoniae is mainly transmitted through droplets, and the pathogen can be carried in secretions during coughing, sneezing, and runny noses. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;03&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;What are the symptoms of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The main symptoms of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection are fever and cough. Generally, the cough is severe, and the cough may continue for 1-2 weeks after the fever subsides. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection can cause upper respiratory tract infections, lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia, and extrapulmonary complications, such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mycoplasma pneumoniae is one of the main pathogens causing the high incidence of pneumonia in autumn and winter in Beijing. Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia is generally an interstitial pneumonia, so the clinical signs are often lighter than the imaging examination results, and after the clinical symptoms disappear, lung imaging examinations may still show inflammation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since Mycoplasma pneumoniae does not have a cell wall, the familiar penicillins and cephalosporins, which are antibiotics that target the cell wall, are completely ineffective against Mycoplasma pneumoniae. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Macrolide antibiotics, such as roxithromycin and azithromycin, are currently the first-choice treatments for Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, if citizens have fever accompanied by severe cough, they should seek medical treatment in time, identify the cause as soon as possible, standardize treatment, and avoid blindly taking medication on their own. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;04&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;How to prevent Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;There is currently no vaccine to prevent Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. The most important thing to prevent Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection is to develop good personal hygiene habits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1. Try to avoid going to public places with dense crowds and poor ventilation, and wear a mask to protect yourself when necessary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2.
