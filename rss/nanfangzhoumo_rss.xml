On September 29, the official website of Northwest Normal University issued a notice stating that the school’s “serious work errors by staff” resulted in “the number of announced postgraduate students being recommended for exemption exceeds the quota for the recommendation plan.” After discovering the problem, the school withdrew the quota for the excess exemption plan and explained to the affected students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Han Yong (pseudonym), the student involved, said that the publicity period was from September 20th to 29th, and they were only informed of the &quot;recruitment for postgraduate qualifications&quot; on the afternoon of the 28th, the day before the end of the publicity period. got canceled&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Insurance Research Incident” and “Research Qualification Cancellation” have become the hot search titles of this incident. However, there are still many factual details that need to be clarified in this incident, and it cannot be simply classified as an &quot;accident&quot; or even a &quot;shady incident.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Recommended exemption from examination&quot; and &quot;successful admission&quot; in postgraduate studies are two completely different concepts. This point was intentionally or unintentionally blurred in media reports, which also made the direction of the incident somewhat out of focus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Generally speaking, senior students seeking postgraduate study must first seek exemption qualifications from their own school before they can apply for pre-admission qualifications from their own school or other schools. At the same time, there are still divisions in the admission methods of the postgraduate entrance examination such as &quot;summer camp&quot;, &quot;pre-recommendation exemption&quot; and &quot;nine recommendation&quot; (exemption in September). In terms of acceptance units, there are also &quot;internal protection&quot; (our school) and &quot;external recommendation&quot; (other schools). ) difference. The priority of summer camp and pre-recommendation exemption is higher than that of &quot;nine promotions&quot;, and &quot;internal protection&quot; is more certain than &quot;external promotion&quot;. These are subdivided tracks in the &quot;protection research world&quot;, and each competition The rules of the Tao game are also different and cannot be generalized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this &quot;recruitment accident&quot;, the &quot;disqualified&quot; students participated in the &quot;September Exemption&quot;, which is referred to as the &quot;Nine Promotions&quot;. According to the &quot;Notice on Recommending Excellent Fresh Undergraduates to Study for Master&#39;s Degrees Without Examination in 2024&quot; released on the official website of Northwest Normal University on September 16, the timetable for this promotion is &quot;Students apply on September 17, 9 From September 17th to 20th, the college will recommend, and the school will review it on September 20th.&quot; Then it is &quot;from September 20th to 29th, the school will publicize the list of proposed recommendations, and the publicity period will be 10 days.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the general exemptions, Northwest Normal University’s notice on September 16 also announced other types of “September exemptions”, such as the “Bachelor-Master Integration” special program, “Counselor Program” &quot;Special Program&quot;, &quot;Rural School Education Master Teacher Training Program&quot; (referred to as &quot;Agricultural Master&quot;), &quot;Graduate Education Support Team&quot; special program, etc. are recommended to exempt enrollment plans. Among them, the recommendation work for “counselor special projects” is the responsibility of the Student Affairs Department of the Party Committee and belongs to the “Administrative Research Guarantee in Colleges and Universities”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to &quot;Zongpan News&quot; quoting the student involved, Xiao Hong (pseudonym), more than 100 students were affected by this &quot;accident&quot;, and they mainly applied for the &quot;Undergraduate and Master&#39;s Integrated Excellent Middle School&quot; There are two promotion projects: &quot;Teacher&quot; and &quot;Counselor Special&quot;. China News Network’s report also showed that the two students interviewed applied for the “Counselor Special Program” and were subsequently disqualified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The notice shows that the &quot;Counselor Special Program&quot; is recommended by the Party Committee&#39;s Academic Affairs Department, and the academic system is &quot;1+Basic Academic System&quot;. After graduating from senior year, students must be full-time counselors for one year; &quot;Bachelor and Master&#39;s Integration&quot; The selection process is limited to the college and the receiving major, and a training agreement needs to be signed. The academic system is &quot;3+1+2&quot;, that is, three years for undergraduates, one year for transition, and two years for the master&#39;s degree in education. At least judging from the literal meaning of this document, the school has greater discretion and decision-making power over the admissions of these two internal postgraduate programs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pushing the issue to this point, based on the existing information, it is not difficult to conclude that there is indeed a possibility that the school made a mistake, that is, the school staff &quot;slid&quot;, allowing two &quot;internal graduate protection of the school&quot; projects The announced number of graduate students recommended for exemption exceeds the number of places in the recommendation plan, resulting in an excess quota. The key lies in how the planned quota of the disqualified postgraduate program is calculated, whether it is included in the total quota, and whether the school has the right to cancel it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A &quot;Boya Database&quot; published by Northwest Normal University on September 16 released the &quot;2024 Excellent Fresh Undergraduate Graduates Recommended Master&#39;s Degree Distribution Table&quot; shows that Northwest Normal University&#39;s &quot;2024 Class of There are 702 postgraduate positions, which is a significant increase from the previous session (641 people).&quot; Among them, 35 people are planned to be admitted to the &quot;Counselor Special Program&quot; and as many as 100 people are planned to be admitted to the &quot;Bachelor-Master Integrated Special Program&quot;. And these 702 people do not include the &quot;counselor specialization&quot;. Can it be said that the &quot;counselor special project&quot; itself is somewhat &quot;supernumerary&quot; in nature, so the school has the right to handle it flexibly? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The quotas for the &quot;Counselor Special Program&quot; and &quot;Bachelor-Master&#39;s Integrated Program&quot; last year were 40 and 60 respectively. It can be seen that this year, the number of places for the &quot;Counselor Special Program&quot; has decreased while the number of places for the &quot;Integrated Bachelor&#39;s and Master&#39;s Program&quot; has increased. After the &quot;accident&quot;, Zhao Qin (pseudonym) said in an interview with China News Network that &quot;it was the middle part that was disqualified&quot; because &quot;Nongshuo has signed a contract and the deal is done, so we can only cancel ours.&quot; Han Yong also said that &quot;all counselors in our college who have been specially guaranteed for postgraduate study have been disqualified.&quot; This detail also shows that the contract signing time and formal enrollment for the &quot;Counselor Special Program&quot; are later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At what point in time did the mistake of &quot;excess public announcement of personnel&quot; occur? Why is there overstaffing? On what basis were the personnel quotas for the two affected research protection projects determined to be &quot;excess&quot;? Are the only over-subscribed projects the “counselor specialization” and “undergraduate and master’s degree integration”? Or could it be said that the school does have greater discretion over the two &quot;internally guaranteed postgraduate programs within the school&quot; and has the right to cancel or change the enrollment plan during the list publicity period? The answers to these questions will determine whether the nature of the &quot;accident&quot; is just a work error or a procedural breach of trust. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, the school should answer the specific details of the &quot;excess number of students found&quot; and announce to the outside world the specific rules of the several &quot;our school&#39;s postgraduate protection&quot; projects affected this time. In this way, it will be clear at a glance whether it is a mistake or a breach of trust. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[指定居所监视居住，不能走样变形丨法眼]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258078]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-04 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/04/uhg2cLvAxVLP9h2Z4iB0ZrIzgaZpOHEBlp6IYrBu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height=&quot;951&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/04/uhg2cLvAxVLP9h2Z4iB0ZrIzgaZpOH EBlp6IYrBu. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252997&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 14, 2023, on the first floor of Xinle Hotel, Xinle City, Hebei Province, there are The four walls of the room are all soft walls. The father of Bao Qinrui, the &quot;resident&quot; person, said that they had been placed under residential surveillance here. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Han Qian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Residential surveillance in a designated residence (hereinafter referred to as &quot;residence&quot;) is a criminal coercive measure. Recently, an unfortunate incident was linked to this coercive measure, making people rethink this system:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early morning of July 7, 2022, the police removed 33-year-old Bao Qinrui from Shijiazhuang, where he lived. He was taken away from his home in Yuhua District. Soon, his wife was informed that Bao Qinrui was living in Xinle City (a county-level city under the jurisdiction of Shijiazhuang) on ​​suspicion of picking quarrels and provoking trouble. Thirteen days after &quot;Zhiju&quot;, Bao Qinrui passed away. (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For details, please see the Southern Weekend App report on September 19 &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infzm.com/contents/256978?source =131&quot;>;The person who was &quot;accused&quot; passed away, and the police said that the other co-defendants &quot;should not pursue criminal responsibility&quot;&lt;/a>;》&lt;/span>;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The cause of Qinrui&#39;s death will be revealed here Putting it aside and focusing on the accusation of violence against Qin Rui - how this criminal coercive measure is carried out and how it should operate is worthy of re-examination. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Residential surveillance, divided into two&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;my country&#39;s 1979 Criminal Procedure Law stipulates five coercive measures - summons, release on bail pending trial, residential surveillance, There has been neither an increase nor a decrease in detentions and arrests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Residential surveillance was originally a milder form and was not considered a &quot;custodial measure&quot; at first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Residential surveillance stipulated in Paragraph 2 of Article 38 of the 1979 Criminal Procedure Law is very simple, &quot;The defendant under residential surveillance shall not leave the designated area. Residential surveillance shall be carried out by the local public security police station, or by an entrusted The people&#39;s commune and the unit where the defendant works shall be implemented.&quot; At that time, suspects and defendants were collectively referred to as &quot;defendants&quot;, and residential surveillance measures did not distinguish between &quot;residences&quot; where they lived. Judging from the application of this measure, residential surveillance is a non-custodial measure. Although the scope of activities of suspects and defendants is restricted, their personal freedom is not deprived. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1996, when the Criminal Procedure Law was revised, residential surveillance measures separated a &quot;residential residence&quot; from the residential surveillance that restricts personal freedom, and was used for suspects and defendants who &quot;have no fixed residence&quot; The suspects and defendants are required to &quot;not leave their designated residence without approval&quot; and the scope of their personal freedom is narrowed to &quot;the designated residence&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the semantic point of view of the legal provisions, &quot;not leaving without permission&quot; is a restriction on the person who is &quot;designated to live&quot;. The suspects and defendants still have personal freedom to &quot;leave&quot; the designated residence. The possibility, that is, not being completely deprived, probably belongs to a kind of &quot;house arrest.&quot; However, in practice, being &quot;resident&quot; is no longer the original meaning of &quot;residential surveillance&quot;, but has become a kind of detention, which is just different from being detained in a detention center like detention or arrest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2012, the Criminal Procedure Law was revised again, and the conditions for release on bail pending trial and residential surveillance were separated. Only those who meet the arrest conditions and legal circumstances can be released on bail pending trial. Article 73 of the law stipulates: &quot;Residential surveillance shall be carried out after the crime has been committed.&quot; The execution may be carried out at the residence of the suspect or defendant; if there is no fixed residence, the execution may be carried out at a designated residence. For suspected crimes endangering national security, crimes of leaving terrorist activities, or particularly serious bribery crimes, execution at the residence may hinder the investigation, after the previous With the approval of the People&#39;s Procuratorate at the highest level and the public security organ, enforcement can also be carried out in a designated residence. However, it cannot be carried out in a place of detention or a special case handling place.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So far, the legislation has tacitly approved the use of residential surveillance in a designated residence as a form of surveillance. This hidden meaning can also be seen in the practice of various detention measures, and the applicable conditions for residential surveillance are closer to the conditions for arrest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this way, residential surveillance has changed from a non-custodial measure to a custodial measure, and the suspects and defendants who have been &quot;residenced&quot; are deprived of their personal freedom. Not only that, the place of residential surveillance has also become a place of interrogation. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Become &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; a temporary “case handling place” &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Article 73 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that “it shall not be used in places of detention, specialized It is not prohibited to turn a residence under designated residential surveillance into a temporary &quot;case-handling place&quot;. In fact, the measure of residential surveillance has become an investigative measure to obtain confessions due to the designated residence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This combination of detention and interrogation means that for the case-handling agency, the interrogation conducted at the designated residence is subject to few external constraints, and the interrogation process is conducive to the control and regulation of the case-handling personnel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Interrogation is conducted in a confined space outside a detention center. If the rights of criminal suspects and defendants are not to be infringed, they must submit obediently and provide the confessions expected by the investigators on a tap; or the investigators must comply with the interrogation. Standardize and consciously restrain the inertia and impulse of illegal evidence collection. When criminal suspects and defendants are not docile and actively cooperate, torture, torture, and corporal punishment and abuse can easily occur. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the place of &quot;residence&quot; is also a temporary &quot;case handling place&quot;, the case handlers in the pre-trial stage also become caretakers. Therefore, eliminating outside interference has become an inevitable choice. Not only are close relatives of people under such residential surveillance not allowed to meet with them, even lawyers are not allowed to meet with them, and they cannot even know where the criminal suspects or defendants are designated to live. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The defense lawyer complained that the accused residents’ rights to lawyers were not even as good as those of criminal suspects and defendants when they were detained in the detention center, because criminal suspects and defendants could still meet with their lawyers in the detention center. , but they are not allowed to meet him while under residential surveillance, creating a reality that is obviously disproportionate to the principle of proportionality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that the close relatives of the accused resident are not informed of their designated place during the pretrial proceedings. Article 161 of the Supreme People&#39;s Court&#39;s &quot;Interpretation on the Application of the Criminal Procedure Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; Paragraph 2 stipulates that the close relatives of the parties should be notified of the reason and location of residence. This is because after investigation, review and prosecution of the case, it is no longer necessary to obtain confessions from the defendant outside the court. Therefore, the details of the coercive measures taken have also changed. The accusation without the function of obtaining confessions is undoubtedly closer to the essence of residential surveillance. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The non-custodial nature should be returned&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to the name, if &quot;resident residence&quot; is still a &quot;residential surveillance&quot; measure, it should be related to the custodial measure. Essentially different, not just a formal and meaningful difference in the form of a place of detention. In other words, people under residential surveillance should have a certain degree of personal freedom. If this freedom is completely deprived, it is a measure of detention rather than residential surveillance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although nothing can be seen from the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law itself, in actual case handling, residential surveillance at a designated location has indeed lost its essence of residential surveillance and has become a detention measure. During the Republic of my country, the Criminal Procedure Law of our country already included &quot;residential surveillance&quot;. This measure existed as an alternative to detention, or as a measure to release from detention. The current residential surveillance is slightly different from the word order, but the nature of this measure is originally the same. Confusing residential surveillance with detention measures, even though there are differences in detention places, is still a flaw in the design of the criminal justice system or an act that exceeds legal boundaries in judicial practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Personal freedom is a basic human right second only to the right to life and health, and is guaranteed by the solemn commitment of the Constitution. Personal freedom is not absolute. Personal freedom can be restricted or deprived for the needs of social defense, the need for litigation and evidence preservation, the need for the personal preservation of the person being prosecuted, and as a penalty measure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, deprivation of personal freedom—whether as a social defense measure, a litigation safeguard measure, or a punishment method—needs to go through legal due process, that is, it is decided by the judicial authority, which leads to the judicial monopoly of the power of imprisonment. Sexuality and inalienability, non-judicial authorities may not deprive personal liberty for the above purposes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that the deprivation of personal liberty stipulated in the Constitution as a protective measure appears with the word &quot;arrest&quot;. &quot;Arrest&quot; in the Constitution cannot be understood as an arrest in various coercive measures in criminal proceedings. It should be understood in a broad sense, that is, any arrest substance, no matter what the name is, will be regarded as an &quot;arrest&quot; in the Constitution and must be carried out in accordance with the Constitution. The prescribed restrictions are implemented - approval or decision of the People&#39;s Procuratorate and decision of the People&#39;s Court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The deprivation of personal freedom as a protective measure in our country ignores the broad nature of &quot;arrest&quot; in the Constitution. In addition to arrest, there are many personal freedoms that have the same essence as arrest but do not appear in the name of arrest. Deprivation measures have caused the constitutional guarantee of personal freedom to become undistributed in practice. Zhiju refers to a detention measure that is not in the name of &quot;arrest&quot; and is not held in a detention place but has the same essence as arrest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The death of Bao Qinrui gives us the opportunity to examine the custodialization of residential surveillance and let us think: we should return residential surveillance to its non-custodial nature and avoid confusing its essence with custodial measures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 20:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[史上首次，美国“三号人物”被投票罢免]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258082]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-04 19:26:21&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;video id=&quot;contents-video-0&quot; data-fileid=&quot;5576678021854946024&quot; data-media=&quot; video&quot; data-resource=&quot;tencent&quot; data-filename=&quot;For the first time in history, the &quot;No. 3&quot; figure in the United States was voted out of office.mp4&quot; data-cover=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/d9dca36avodtranscq1251434507/543d88ee5576678021854946024/sampleSnapshot /sampleSnapshot_10_0.jpg&quot; data-url=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/02f2b5c2vodcq1251434507/543d88ee5576678021854946024/bJQdQltDrtQA.mp4&quot; poster=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height =&quot;360&quot;>; &lt;source src=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/02f2b5c2vodcq1251434507/543d88ee5576678021854946024/bJQdQltDrtQA.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;>;&lt;/video>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 19:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[全红婵 陈芋汐：神仙姐妹交相辉映]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258068]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-04 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/04/ssInabNEeMfdv7wu3WdauUzBwGZTGEBjjefNE7g7.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/04/ssInabNEeMfdv7wu3WdauUzBwGZTGEBjjefNE7 g7. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252991&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 30, 2023, the women&#39;s synchronized 10-meter platform final of the diving event at the Hangzhou Asian Games , the champion Chinese combination Quan Hongchan (right) and Chen Yuxi (left) at the award ceremony &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the women&#39;s single 10-meter platform final of the Asian Games held on the afternoon of October 3, 2023, Quan Hongchan reproduced the &quot;splash disappearing technique&quot; and won the championship with 438.20 points.

The problem is that she has grown taller and her position For female divers, development difficulties must be faced.&quot; He Weiyi, Quan Hongchan&#39;s head coach of the Guangdong Provincial Team, analyzed in a post-match review. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the two years since the Tokyo Olympics, Quan Hongchan has grown 7 centimeters in height and gained weight, which is a difficult problem for divers. Zhou Jihong, the current leader of the national diving team, once pointed out that the women&#39;s 10-meter platform has extremely strict requirements on the height and weight of athletes. Among all diving events, this is the one with the most frequent and cruel personnel iterations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps the most typical positive example is Quan Hongchan’s current head coach and former Olympic diving champion Chen Ruolin. Beginning in 2010, 18-year-old Chen Ruolin began to diet in order to prevent her physical development from interfering with her diving career. She only ate one full meal a day all year round and persisted for 6 years until she retired. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Tokyo Olympics, He Weiyi once expressed concern about Quan Hongchan, &quot;Her natural sense of strength is fully capable of helping her through the growth period, but the premise of all this is: she needs enough Self-disciplined and using very strict standards to control her weight.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the title of &quot;genius&quot;, He Weiyi does not agree, &quot;People on the Internet praise her too highly. Only through hard training can Only those who have survived development and injuries, as well as physical, psychological, technical, tactical and physical difficulties, can be called a &#39;genius&#39;.&quot; And this is what he expects from Quan Hongchan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/04/fxA4lGMXHXNDbrmGM8CbzbvnJ7hAs2rdHpuA1UOC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;619&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/04/fxA4lGMXHXNDbrmGM8CbzbvnJ7hAs2rdHpuA1UOC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252994&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 3, 2023, Chinese player Quan Hongchan competed in the women&#39;s 10-meter platform final of the diving event at the Hangzhou Asian Games&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The platform duo competed and achieved mutual success&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The women&#39;s single 10-meter platform final of the Hangzhou Asian Games Three days ago, Quan Hongchan and Chen Yuxi won the gold medal with a huge advantage in the women&#39;s synchronized 10-meter platform competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Tokyo Olympics, the two formed the new women&#39;s synchronized diving combination of the Chinese team. Since &quot;holding hands&quot;, the two have never missed the gold medal in any major or small competition, and their complete sets of movements have basically maintained a score of more than 360. On the court, they are both partners and rivals, so they are often compared together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A common comment is that Quan Hongchan&#39;s specifications (including aerial posture) are slightly higher than Chen Yuxi&#39;s, while the latter&#39;s stability is even better. Entering the Paris Olympic cycle, peak duels between the two often occur. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the World Diving Championships, Chen Yuxi defeated Quan Hongchan to win the championship; in the Diving World Cup, Chen Yuxi also defeated Quan Hongchan to win the championship, which also made Chen Yuxi only one step away from the Grand Slam. Short of an Olympic singles gold medal, Chen Yuxi has become one of the most stable core members of the Chinese diving team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;My advantage is that I am relatively stable, but I cannot say that it is particularly stable, because diving is an event with relatively large changing factors.

Four months later, Chen Yuxi won the women&#39;s single 10-meter platform championship at the World Championships with 439 points.

The topic of UFOs and aliens has always been a hot topic of public concern, triggering continuous discussions and becoming a classic theme in science fiction works. At the same time, scientists are also trying to use scientific methods to study this field and look beyond the earth to search for signs of life on exoplanets. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Remains of extraterrestrial creatures&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Farce&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;There are endless revelations about aliens around the world, most of which are due to lack of evidence. Can&#39;t make much of a splash. However, the appearance of the remains of two suspected &quot;alien creatures&quot; at a hearing in the Mexican Congress attracted widespread attention from the media and the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 12, 2023, local time, the Mexican Congress held the first public hearing related to the &quot;Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, UAP&quot; in the capital, Mexico City. At this hearing, Mexican journalist, author and UFO enthusiast Jaime Maussan presented his &quot;discovery&quot; of the remains of two suspected &quot;alien creatures&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Mozan, the two remains were discovered in a diatom mine in Cusco, Peru, in 2017. After dating by the National Autonomous University of Mexico, the two remains were dated 1,800 years ago. years and 700 years. As can be seen from the pictures at the scene, the remains have an elongated head and three fingers on each hand. The appearance of the two remains is very similar to the alien images described in some science fiction works, causing heated discussions on social media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mossan stated: &quot;These two remains have nothing to do with humans.&quot; However, the &quot;alien creatures&quot; mentioned by Moosang immediately aroused huge doubts. This is not the first time that Moissan has thrown out similar news. In 2015, Mossan claimed to have discovered the remains of a suspected &quot;alien creature&quot; in Peru and held a ticketed tour. However, the remains were later confirmed to be the mummified remains of a child. In 2017, Mozan claimed to have discovered the remains of &quot;alien creatures&quot; in the Nazca region of Peru, but was immediately refuted by Peruvian officials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called &quot;evidence&quot; Moissan gave this time is also unconvincing. In response to Mosan&#39;s statement, the National Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Laboratory of the National Autonomous University of Mexico re-issued a statement that was first released in 2017. The laboratory said in a statement that they were not involved in collecting the samples and had not seen the entire specimen. Therefore, they were only responsible for testing the age of the samples submitted for inspection and would not draw conclusions about the source of the samples. Mosang also claimed that he invited forensic doctors to use X-ray scanning technology to examine the remains and found that there were egg-like structures in the remains. Julieta Fierro, a scientist at the Astronomy Research Center of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, criticized this, saying that more advanced technology than X-ray scanning would be needed to determine whether the two remains were human. Antígona Segura, an astrobiologist at the Nuclear Science Research Center of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, even said: &quot;These conclusions are not supported by evidence at all. The whole thing is shameful.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;The Mexican Congress held this hearing to discuss the AirSpace Protection Law (AirSpace Protection Law) and promote relevant legislation. If this law is passed, Mexico will become the first country in the world to recognize &quot;extraterrestrial life forms&quot; &quot;Country that exists. However, after the hearing, the Mexican Congress did not provide conclusive opinions, and the future of this bill is still unclear. Sergio Gutierrez, a member of the Mexican Congress, said: &quot;We are paying attention to this issue and we can continue to discuss it.&quot; However, after being criticized by the scientific community, Moissan&#39;s &quot;discovery&quot; this time There is a high probability that it will end hastily again. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;New &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Report&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When the remains of &quot;alien creatures&quot; once again arouse people&#39;s attention to extraterrestrial creatures, The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) held a press conference at its headquarters in Washington, DC, on September 14, 2023, local time, and released the latest research report of an independent research team formed by the agency to study unknown anomalies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;NASA defines &quot;unidentified anomalies&quot; as &quot;observations in the sky that cannot be scientifically identified as aircraft or known natural phenomena.&quot; On June 9, 2022, NASA announced the establishment of this research team. The team is composed of 16 experts from different fields such as astronomy, physics, meteorology, etc. These disciplines have varying degrees of connection with the study of unknown anomalies. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;NASA believes that researchers have now obtained a certain number of high-quality observations of unknown abnormal events, and have the basic conditions to draw solid scientific conclusions about the nature of these events.因此，美国国家航空航天局成立了这个独立研究小组，旨在从科学角度检视不明异常现象，并且为如何使用数据和科学工具来推进我们对不明异常现象的理解制定一份路线图。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;公众可以在美国国家航空航天局的官网上下载这份36页的报告。报告包括几个部分的内容：前面的部分对研究小组和这份报告进行了简要介绍，中间的主体部分以8组问答的形式回答了小组如何开展研究等问题，最后的部分是结论、建议和致谢。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;研究小组在这份报告中给出的结论是目前尚无任何支持外星人存在的证据，大部分不明飞行物事件都可以用科学来解释。但与此同时，他们也没有完全排除外星人存在的可能性。虽然结论并不出人意料，但这份报告的重要意义在于提示美国国家航空航天局在未来哪些可能的数据可以被收集以探索不明异常现象的本质和起源。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在新闻发布会上，美国国家航空航天局局长比尔·尼尔森（Bill Nelson）表示：“在美国国家航空航天局，探索并追问事物为何如此已经嵌入到我们的基因中。我想向独立研究团队表示感谢，他们启发我们在未来如何更好地研究和分析不明异常现象。”他同时强调，美国国家航空航天局的目标是将人们对不明异常现象的讨论从奇谈转向科学层面。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在新闻发布会上，美国国家航空航天局表示，已经任命一位新的不明异常现象研究主任，这位主任将领导研究小组在收集和分析数据的过程中强化人工智能和机器学习的使用。这份报告也强调了在未来的研究中加强新技术的应用。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;答案或在系外&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;行星&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在地球上寻找外星生物的努力基于外星生物曾经造访地球这样一个前提，由此把寻找范围限制在有能力到达地球的智慧生物的范围内。但正如地球上的生命形态千差万别一样，宇宙中的其他地方如果有生命的话，也可能并非是智慧生命，而是如地球上的微生物一样的初级形态。因此，当天文学家把搜索的目光投向系外行星之时，他们会关注任何可能的生命存在的迹象。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年9月11日，在美国马里兰州巴尔的摩召开的詹姆斯·韦布空间望远镜运行首年的会议上，一个由英国剑桥大学领导的国际研究团队公布了对一颗名为K2-18&amp;nbsp;b的系外行星的最新研究结果。他们在这颗行星的大气中发现了甲烷和二氧化碳，这是天文学家首次在一个位于宜居带内的系外行星的大气中发现碳基分子；同时，他们还可能发现了在地球上被认为与生命活动有关的化学物质。这项研究成果还将发表在《天体物理学杂志快报》（&lt;em>;Astrophysical Journal Letters&lt;/em>;）上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这颗系外行星距离地球120光年，质量大约是地球的8.6倍，半径是地球的2.6倍，围绕着冷矮星K2-18运转，位于这个系统的宜居带中。天文学家最初使用哈勃空间望远镜对这颗行星的大气进行了探测，但彼时它的大气组成充满争议。天文学家经过研究，把这颗行星归类到称为“氢海行星”（Hycean exoplanet）的系外行星类别中。这类行星的大气富含氢，其下的行星表面被海洋所覆盖，在我们的太阳系中不存在这种大小介于地球和海王星之间的行星。此后，他们使用詹姆斯·韦布空间望远镜对这颗行星进行了更加细致的研究。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通过使用詹姆斯·韦布空间望远镜的高分辨率设备，他们在最新公布的研究中确认这颗行星的大气中含有甲烷和二氧化碳。同时，他们还在K2-18&amp;nbsp;b的光谱中发现了一个微弱的信号，分析表明这个信号可能是由一种叫作二甲硫醚（dimethyl sulphide，DMS）的分子产生的。在地球上，目前我们已知二甲硫醚只能由生命活动产生，地球大气中的大部分二甲硫醚都是由海洋浮游植物释放的，这表明在K2-18&amp;nbsp;b上也可能存在类似的生命活动。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这篇论文的第一作者、英国剑桥大学的天文学家尼库·麦杜苏德汉（Nikku Madhusudhan）表示：“我们的发现强调了在其他地方寻找生命的过程中考虑多样的宜居环境的重要性。对系外行星上生命的搜寻传统上主要关注较小的岩质行星，但较大的氢海行星很明显更便于进行大气观测。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，天文学家还需要进一步的观测来确认二甲硫醚的存在。麦杜苏德汉表示，詹姆斯·韦布望远镜接下来的观测将会确认二甲硫醚是否真的存在于K2-18&amp;nbsp;b的大气中。这个研究团队认为，K2-18&amp;nbsp;b和其他氢海行星可能是我们在太阳系外发现生命的绝佳地点。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;詹姆斯·韦布空间望远镜投入使用一年多来，展示出强大的观测能力，不断给天文学家送上惊喜。随着更多更强大的空间望远镜和地基望远镜陆续投入使用、开工建造或者列入研发日程，天文学家将获得越来越强大的观测系外行星的能力。也许在地球上发现外星生命只是一个幻想，但如果外星生命真的存在的话，在不远的将来，我们将有可能在某一颗系外行星上探测到它们活动的迹象。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/03/LdhG4qqa7a7vUhM2yf5FXKKIbvDGmUxPyUFpWymE.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;635&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/03/LdhG4qqa7a7vUhM2yf5FXKKIbvDGmUxPyUFpWymE.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252973&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;在墨西哥国会举办的听证会现场所展示的遗骸。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（路透社/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/03/2mapv6MsFjVZXXjxxbF70wRaXgQj9T8abzGIy1tm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2560&quot; height=&quot;1094&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/03/2mapv6MsFjVZXXjxxbF70wRaXgQj9T8abzGIy1tm.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252972&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;美国国家航空航天局不明异常现象研究小组成员。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（NASA/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/03/thCtXyW4lh5rn7bzhiFcHXpwr6JJ30BM9cjSnprR.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/03/thCtXyW4lh5rn7bzhiFcHXpwr6JJ30BM9cjSnprR.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252971&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;系外行星K2-18 b环绕冷矮星K2-18运行的艺术想象图。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（NASA/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[南阳迷笛音乐节营地大量失窃上热搜：全力破案方能挽回声誉丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258070]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-04 15:28:30&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Halfway through the long holiday, the Midi Music Festival held in Nanyang, Henan suddenly appeared on the social media hot search list, not because How well done, but because - &quot;stealing things&quot;. For this city that was once famous for Zhuge Wolong, if the case cannot be solved as soon as possible, not only may the next Midi Music Festival be ruined, but it will also affect the reputation of the entire city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 3, the keywords &quot;Midi steals things&quot; quickly became hot topics on social media. According to information released by netizens at the scene, the music festival had ended the day before, and many music fans who participated in the music festival had not yet evacuated. However, a large number of nearby villagers went into the campground to search for things. According to Solitaire’s stolen property statistics, some people’s clothing and shoes were stolen, some wine and tea were stolen, some camping equipment such as tents, sleeping bags, and moisture-proof mats were lost, and high-value electronic and digital products such as computers, mobile phones, cameras, and recording equipment were stolen. Some &quot;thiefs&quot; only took away the tent, leaving other materials neatly in place. Even the fist-thick cables on the stage were stolen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to self-reported information by the thieves, the total value of the stolen materials may reach hundreds of thousands of yuan. A video circulating on the Internet shows a middle-aged woman who was caught taking something out of her bag while defending herself: &quot;We just went to get it when no one was there,&quot; as if the owner of the tent had temporarily left ( Maybe you go out to eat or even just use the toilet), the things in the tent become ownerless and can be taken as you please. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the first original music festival in China, the Midi Music Festival with a history of more than 20 years has become one of the most famous carnivals in the Chinese music industry, especially rock music. For the venue where the music festival is held, tens of thousands of enthusiastic music fans from all over the country will not only bring direct income to the local area, but also become an excellent opportunity to promote the local area. Therefore, many cities, especially third- and fourth-tier cities, are competing to hold or invite large-scale music festivals to be held locally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This Midi Music Festival was held in Nanyang and also received great attention from the local area. According to the official social media account &quot;Nanyang Release&quot; of the Nanyang Municipal Government Information Office, on September 29, the opening day of the Central Plains Midi Music Festival, the Secretary of the Nanyang Municipal Party Committee and the Mayor, wearing red volunteer uniforms, personally greeted the guests at the exit of Nanyang Railway Station. Music fans all over the country. Half a month ago, Nanyang City held a preparatory meeting for the Midi Music Festival. The Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee personally made arrangements and required the establishment of a high-standard headquarters at the municipal level to carefully carry out various guarantee work for the music festival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few days before the opening of the music festival, the Nanyang Municipal Government Information Office also released a city image promotional video and a local &quot;food, drink, and fun picture&quot; through its official account to promote local tourism resources. Such high-standard preparation and reception highlight the importance attached to the music festival. It was with this kind of attention that the music festival itself seemed to go without any problems. However, what was unexpected was that large-scale thefts occurred after the festival. It can be said that the previous efforts were ruined. This makes the previous official statement of “protecting the personal and property safety of tourists” a joke. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to theft, netizens who attended the music festival accused some people of harassing tourists in the name of toasting during dinner in the hotel, and even beating tourists while drunk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This information spreads rapidly through social networks. If the local area fails to take prompt measures to identify problems such as theft and harassment, it will greatly damage the image of the local area. In addition to the stolen music fans who said that if there is no result in handling this incident, they will never visit Nanyang again. Some netizens also said that they felt very unsafe after watching the video of the villagers taking things away, and they will definitely do so when traveling in the future. Avoid this place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the descriptions of the thieves and live music fans, most of the thieves were local villagers, who even used tricycles to pull the items. This scene can&#39;t help but remind people of the situations that have happened in many places before where villagers stole the crops of foreign agricultural entrepreneurs. It was reported in the summer of 2019 that a sweet potato farmer in Henan contracted 200 acres of land to grow watermelons. When the watermelons matured, nearby villagers gathered in groups to steal the melons. A melon-picking incident also occurred in Jiaxing, Zhejiang, where almost all the watermelons from more than 20 greenhouses were stolen. Some melon thieves were even caught by melon farmers and fell to the ground and were &quot;injured&quot; during the pulling process. Instead, the melon farmers were asked to pay compensation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In these theft incidents, some places often use various excuses to excuse local farmers. For example, it is not &quot;theft&quot;, but they believe the rumor that &quot;the owner doesn&#39;t want it anymore&quot;, or there are people in the local area who are not the owners. The tradition of “picking up the leaks” after harvesting, etc. In the Midi Music Festival theft incident, some participants alleged that after catching the thief and calling the police, the police let the villagers go because &quot;there was no evidence to prove the theft.&quot; If the property of participants cannot be protected for a large-scale event that the government attaches so much importance to, who will dare to come here in the future? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is true that the quality of villagers in some places is not high, they are greedy for petty gains, and their legal awareness is weak. They have the idea that the law does not punish the public, and they feel that taking some things from &quot;outsiders&quot; will not do anything. If local officials do not take severe measures to punish these thieving villagers and cannot effectively protect the interests of foreign tourists or investors, and their reputation is ruined, no one will dare to travel or invest here again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the announcement from the Midi Music Festival Organizing Committee, the local police have set up a task force to investigate the theft cases. Some fans also reported that some of the stolen items had been recovered. This time Nanyang must make every effort to solve the case, recover the stolen goods, reduce the losses of music fans, and at the same time severely punish the thieves without mercy. Only in this way can it be possible to restore the reputation, restore the music festival, restore the music fans, and restore the tourists from all over the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 15:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[颜歌：英语世界里的少数族裔]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257450]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-04 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/20/ERThthpwjc4pFBkH71171Fy2GAIFQY7zJqMvpifj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/ERThthpwjc4pFBkH71171Fy2GAIFQY7z JqMvpifj. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251382&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;(Feng Xiaoping/Picture)&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One day in the summer of 2017, Yan Ge was vaccinating her one-month-old son at a clinic in Dublin when she suddenly received an email from Irish writer Lucy Caldwell. She was invited to contribute to Faber&#39;s short story collection Being Various: New Irish Short Stories ( &quot;Short Story Collection&quot;&lt;/span>;) Write a novel. Lucy is the editor of this collection. She had read two of Yan Gefa&#39;s stories in the &quot;Irish Times&quot; and found them interesting, so she came here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yan Ge still remembers her shock at that time: first of all, she was an outsider, no one in the Irish literary world knew her, she had only published two novels in newspapers; secondly, she was the only one in Ireland. How did you become an Irish writer after living for a few years? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In that email that made Yan Ge feel unreal, Lucy greatly broadened the concept of Irish writers - this concept should include writers who were born in Ireland but grew up elsewhere, and writers who were chosen from elsewhere. Writers who call Ireland home include those who somehow find themselves living in Ireland. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What happened next unfolded smoothly. Yan Ge wrote a story that took place in Dublin, &quot;How I Fell in Love with the Well-Documented Life of Alex Whelan&quot;, which was well received and included in this new collection of Irish short stories. The first article (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Published in 2019&lt;/span>;). Later, Angus, the editor of &quot;Different: A Collection of New Irish Short Stories&quot; and director of Faber Publishing, learned that Yan Ge was writing a collection of short stories and approached his agent, Matt, hoping to She gave Faber exclusive preview rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/fNclzsO4zmmZmaYmqR2Fj9t55L8glzuUoiCpIvtK.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;1279&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/fNclzsO4zmmZmaYmqR2Fj9t55L8glzuUoiCpIvtK.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251380&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Yan Ge visited Wangcong Temple in his hometown of Pi County when he was a child&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Faber is a purely literary publishing organization founded in 1921. It has published the works of 13 Nobel Prize writers and 6 Booker Prize writers. There will be no sky-high royalties, and packaging and promotion will not cost as much as cutting-edge companies. If it is not given to Faber, the agent will submit the work to various publishing houses. If multiple publishing houses compete for the manuscript, it will be auctioned. As a result, the manuscript may be sold at a relatively high price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Matt believes that Faber is suitable for Yan Ge’s work. It is of stable quality, responsible, and can be cooperated for a long time. Moreover, the editors of this book are Kazuo Ishiguro and Sebastian. Barry&#39;s managing editor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally Faber was given exclusive preview rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The exclusive preview period generally does not exceed 10 days. Faber responded quickly. He sent the message on Friday and gave the quotation on Wednesday. After the two parties negotiated, it was determined on Thursday that he would buy the rights to two books, including the completed &quot;Elsewhere&quot; and another book scheduled to be delivered in 2024. The novel &quot;Hotel Destination&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This means that the next five years are almost bought out.&quot; Yan Ge is worried that the second book is due to be delivered in April 2024 according to the contract, and because of the Chinese novel &quot;Pingle County Chronicles&quot; All work is behind schedule. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The veteran American literary publisher Scribner will also acquire the copyright for Yan Ge’s collection of short stories and the 2024 novel. Scribner published works by Hemingway and Fitzgerald. It was later acquired by Simon &amp; Schuster and became the company&#39;s flagship publishing house. It also published books by pure literary writers such as Annie Proulx. , and also publishes works by Stephen King, the master of horror novels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/JN1pQDJEs7PrVeKtiyHqlhyTdiV0MdHfQob3MpvM.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/JN1pQDJEs7PrVeKtiyHqlhyTdiV0MdHfQob3MpvM.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251374&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color ) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The signing process with Scribner went smoothly beyond Yan Ge&#39;s expectations. The editor-in-chief and two young editors chatted with Yan Ge over video for an afternoon about the work, and in the evening they settled on North American rights with their agent. Next, the Italian copyright was also negotiated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yan Ge felt a bit like selling futures at the time: &quot;The unfinished novel was sold directly like this. This was the first time in my writing career of more than 20 years. Yes. It may not be a big deal for an English writer, but it is unimaginable for a writer whose mother tongue is Chinese and writes in English.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the summer of 2023, &quot;Elsewhere&quot; will be published in the UK and the United States. , winning praise from media outlets including The Irish Times, The Guardian, The New York Times and The New Yorker. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the summer of 2023, Yan Ge took her son and husband back to Chengdu after three years of COVID-19.

It was a year later that you got an agent. matter. What impressed me most is that you metaphorically joined the &quot;Special Olympics&quot; in the English literary world. Five years later, you have become an English writer signed with a first-class international literary publishing house. Do you still feel like a Paralympian? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yan Ge: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I don’t feel that way anymore. English writing is a new career for me now, and I face many problems, but they are not so-called language problems, or language is the most superficial problem, and it may not even be considered a problem compared with other problems. English writing is a kind of artistic self-exploration for me. If I were an artist, my medium would be words. Now I am using a new way, new tools, new materials and media to make works. This new medium will bring a new change to my works. This is the most important thing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Remember the last interview, you were right I said there is nothing terrible about writing in English. The tone is exactly the same as now. Is there any substantial difference between the two? For example, five years ago you were more free to enjoy the freedom of expression that the new language brought to you. Now , after strict writing training in the English literary tradition, have you found some kind of certainty in your writing? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/eHU1AudW5hab48AceoNgsAEGGT6WpLwPg9ssMeN6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1606&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/eHU1AudW5hab48AceoNgsAEGGT6WpLwPg9ssMeN6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251379&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yan Ge:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Definitely. During the process of studying and living in the UK, I read more and more things in depth, which must be related. I think these are also based on my culture. After all, I am a Chinese writer, so my literary system and narrative system are Chinese. Although I now understand more or less how the other system works, I feel that Chinese is still my language. The root of this is that, ultimately, the way of thinking about Chinese and Chinese literature is an anti-dualistic way. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the English-speaking world, the writing of minority writers like us is a kind of post-colonial cultural expression that must subvert the so-called orthodox English. This is why English as a This is a fate that postcolonial language must face. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Irish writers are probably the first group of writers in the world to write in this post-colonial way, and they are also anti-English. After the British occupied Ireland, Irish became an illegal language. If you spoke Irish, you would be fined and arrested. My husband is Irish. As an intellectual and journalist, he always tells me that you can write in English however you want. We are here to oppose this language anyway. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So when I returned to Ireland, I felt like I was returning to my second natal home. Dublin was the last stop for the promotion of my new English book. As a result, all the tickets for the sharing session were sold out, the venue was full, and there were people sitting on the windowsill. , I was very moved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/avrzkseviR85yr9K8a9wqJRvjyUOm3eLrZSKA2Ll.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1673&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/avrzkseviR85yr9K8a9wqJRvjyUOm3eLrZSKA2Ll.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251372&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In that environment, no one will care about your language. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yan Ge: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, no one will think about this problem. It may have something to do with Irish culture. Everyone thinks this is a natural thing. The two stories I submitted to The Irish Times were published directly by the editor, which made me feel like I had landed in front of English readers. Originally, I was waiting for the editor to give me a lot of revision comments. Gradually, I learned that newspapers here have this tradition and are not very good at changing the author&#39;s manuscripts. Only magazines and books have an editorial process. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/s6ywYWgeztUMcCVqMgdxXBeSyPXZlFhN0QU0bxL5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1674&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/s6ywYWgeztUMcCVqMgdxXBeSyPXZlFhN0QU0bxL5.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251373&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;In the English writing circle, everyone reads and comments on each other&#39;s manuscripts&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;When you first write in English, do you show it to your husband first? I remember when I interviewed Ha Jin in 2001, he said that when he first wrote a novel, he would check whether the words were authentic to his son who was born in the United States. At that time, he had just won the National Book Award in the United States. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yan Ge: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Some of them will be read to him. My husband is my first reader. When I write Chinese, I will also translate it orally to him. share. But if it involves a subject with a Chinese cultural background, it will not be shown to him, but to people who do not understand Chinese culture at all. For example, there is an article &quot;Hai&quot; (Hai) in &quot;Elsewhere&quot;, which is about Confucius and his disciples. It also alludes to the British political system. People without a Chinese cultural background will see a completely different connotation. I asked a historical novelist to read the manuscript, which was more than 20,000 words. She read it carefully and wrote a lot of feedback. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the English writing circle, one thing that I like very much is that everyone reads each other&#39;s manuscripts, devotes a lot of time and energy to each other&#39;s works, and also gives sharp opinions. . My agent was also one of my early readers. This atmosphere is particularly healthy. These people I trust allow me to be bolder and try more things and experiment with more languages ​​without looking forward or backward. It’s like I’m doing acrobatics in this language. Even if I fall down, there are still people. then. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Chinese writers don’t do this. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yan Ge: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Chinese literature talks about genius. I prefer the workshop tradition among British and American literary creative groups. Discussions and discussions give me the feeling of being in a community. A girlfriend of mine sent me a manuscript that she had revised 36 times and asked me to make further comments. Chinese writers would avoid doing this because it would cast doubt on their own genius. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My soon-to-be-published Chinese novel &quot;Pingle County Chronicles&quot; is the product of many years of work behind closed doors. When I first finished it, I was very scared and didn&#39;t know how to write it. I sent it to &quot;Harvest&quot; When editing, I especially hope she can give me feedback. For example, for many ancient poems in the book, I asked the editor to find professionals to help review them. If no one comments, I&#39;m like running around naked, which is terrible. I am probably used to the way Western creative writing groups operate, and I am afraid that others will not give me advice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/zsh2qmh3keyX0vJMj2Y08Uu0P6vmIJHDLtiRydRp.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1671&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/zsh2qmh3keyX0vJMj2Y08Uu0P6vmIJHDLtiRydRp.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251377&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot; The editor wanted me to delete the redundant convoluted parts.&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When writing in English, have you ever imagined what your readers are like? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yan Ge: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When I write in Chinese, I can imagine my readers.

But when writing in English, I feel a sense of panic all the time - I can&#39;t imagine what the reader looks like. He is definitely not white, but I don&#39;t know who he is - he has no face and no identity. I wasn&#39;t a first or second generation immigrant either, just someone stuck there temporarily, and imaginary readers became one of my biggest problems. Then there is the feeling of doing an academic experiment.

When I write in Chinese, I am very rooted - very grounded, so that I can absorb nutrients and feel at ease, but at the same time, it is also tied and fixed.

They are very young, and many of them are ethnic minority authors who are studying creative writing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am very happy, I found that I am writing for these people. We minority writers interact with each other and open up a new English writing space. I just give this The space adds some more possibilities. For example, the most superficial expression is that you can add Chinese to English novels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is easy to fall into the trap of dualism when discussing &quot;readers&quot;. Generally speaking, the English readers that come to mind must be the mainstream society dominated by white people.

For example, there are local white people in my collection of novels, but there are also Chinese things, including Chinese characters, as well as the non-linear time structure of traditional Chinese literature, and even anti-simplification. But I also hope that every type of reader can enter my text and have his own understanding when he leaves. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And the partial uninterpretability of the text is also part of my plan.

Now she and many of us can get out of this stereotype and write stories related to China or It has nothing to do with it. If you write about the real or virtual world, the Middle Ages or the sci-fi future, you can be more creative in content and form. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（采访助理：朱朱。）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[女子10米台，全红婵失误后反超以微弱优势夺冠]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258066]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-04 13:00:03&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;72935&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;69789&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/04/50c67b3a66.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;On October 3, 2023, Quan Hongchan and Chen Yuxi will each Holding their cute dolls in their hands..jpg&quot; alt=&quot;On October 3, 2023, Quan Hongchan and Chen Yuxi held their respective cute dolls in their hands.&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height =&quot;721&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/04/50c67b3a66.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252983&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 3, 2023, Quan Hongchan and Chen Yuxi held their respective cute dolls in their hands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the evening of October 3, 2023, the championship battle for the women&#39;s single 10-meter platform diving event at the Hangzhou Asian Games became Quan Hongchan and Chen Yuxi The rivalry between this pair of teammates.

&lt;p>;Historian Wang Di&#39;s &quot;Teahouse: The Decline and Renaissance of Chengdu&#39;s Public Life 1950-2000&quot; is in Chengdu Xing Bookstore held a new book sharing session. The founder of the bookstore, Zhang Feng, set up a traditional tea seat in front of the stage at the entrance of the bookstore: a table, three bamboo chairs, three bowls of tea, and a thermos. Zhang Feng, as the host, sits on the right. Sitting on the left is artist Wang Hai, who was Wang Di’s classmate at Chengdu No. 3 Middle School. Wang Di sat in the middle. When he didn&#39;t need to talk, he poured water for the two people around him from time to time. This made Zhang Feng feel embarrassed. Wang Di said: I am Dr. Tea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The night after the event, Wang Di and I chatted until more than 10 o&#39;clock under the street lamp of Youxing Bookstore. Wang Di realized that it was very late and asked Zhang Feng who was waiting aside: &quot;When will the bookstore be open?&quot; Zhang Feng said: &quot;It can stay open as long as we like.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few months Previously, before the COVID-19 epidemic was over, Zhang Feng and Lingzi, who was studying for a doctorate in anthropology at Cambridge University, hosted a sharing session by Wang Di at the Dunba Bar in the suburbs of Chengdu. There was no theme and they could talk about whatever they wanted. Wang Di spoke from 7:30 pm to 12:00 midnight. Lingzi paused the chat to let the more than 100 listeners sitting around take a break. Wang Di thought he was done. But Reiko told him that it was just halftime. Wang Di was going to fly to Macau the next morning. I thought he would say, it’s too late today, so let’s just stop here. Unexpectedly, he said, today I will lay down my life to accompany you. The activity lasted until about 1 o&#39;clock in the morning. This is an amazing and vibrant atmosphere in Chengdu’s public space, and those who participate in it will lose track of time. This is the Decameron, but it is much more than the Decameron. I met Brother Feng in both Youxing Bookstore and Dunba. He seemed to be constantly posting about various activities in Chengdu’s public spaces. I admired his energy and he said it was nothing, it was very simple and it didn&#39;t take any time. I also met lawyer Zhang Ying again. She came to participate in Wang Di&#39;s sharing session. The &quot;Bright Dialogue&quot; she hosted is still running. She hopes that people can learn the awareness of thinking instead of just speaking. Skill. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that Wang Di is back in Chengdu, he has been invited to many activities, almost all of which he talked about from morning till night. He was very patient with all kinds of questions, even though he had answered many similar questions many times. He has appeared in various media. He enjoys speaking to the public about his historical research and writing. His name is connected with &quot;street culture&quot;, &quot;pao brother&quot; and &quot;teahouse&quot; in the main fields of his research. He is concerned about the relationship between people and space, communicating specific words and objects. He thinks about the significance of history to the present and is willing to spread his thoughts to a wider scope. He became one of the most popular historians. At the sharing meeting, Zhang Feng talked about the rising &quot;public history&quot; and called Wang Di &quot;the historian in the teahouse.&quot; The background of their conversation was transparent. I could see behind the background board. Old aunties were sitting comfortably on bamboo chairs chatting. A courier guy wearing a helmet was walking with takeaways. People on motorcycles were walking by. Pass. This is a natural superposition of the lives of Chengdu citizens, forming a richly layered visual landscape. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Teahouse: The Decline and Revival of Public Life in Chengdu, 1950-2000&quot; can be referred to as &quot;Teahouse (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Part 2&lt;/span >;)》. In &quot;Teahouse (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Part 1&lt;/span>;), also known as &quot;Teahouse: Public Life and Microcosm of Chengdu 1900-1950&quot;, Wang Di I have compared teahouses in Sichuan and other places, such as teahouses in Guangdong. &quot;Guangdong is generally called a teahouse. On the surface it looks like a teahouse in Sichuan, but it obviously serves the middle class and is different from the &#39;popular&#39; teahouses in Sichuan.&quot; When describing Guangdong teahouses, Wang Di used the word &quot;grand&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Macau, in order to intuitively compare with Sichuan teahouses, Wang Di took us to a Cantonese-style teahouse in the Grand Lisboa for morning tea. This teahouse is more like a fine restaurant, with far more dishes on the table than tea sets. The waiter brought us barbecued pork cakes and carrot cakes from a cart. There are already roast goose, shrimp dumplings, soup dumplings, siomai, beef brisket and fish soup on the table. This sumptuous morning tea costs more than a thousand patacas. The surrounding design is also very thoughtful. The wall decoration is designed with a steamer-like texture, giving people a feeling of steaming steam. Wang Di had been in such steaming heat. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The turning point&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;That day happened to be the time for the college entrance examination in the mainland, and schools in Macau began to have holidays. High school students in Macau do not need to take the college entrance examination. They all apply to go to university. Wang Di feels that children in the mainland are too involved now. &quot;We like the imperial view of history, but we actually advocate being a superior person. We look down on ordinary people, so we hope that our children will not be ordinary people. Let every ordinary person live with dignity. This is what we should advocate. This is what I The reasons for emphasizing the civilian view of history.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/mW0sgmuN7YkrFjGnaL409XWSgtaZHI3NHYzg1FwI.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0 &quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/mW0sgmuN7YkrFjGnaL409XWSgtaZHI3NHYzg1FwI.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252387&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 17, 2023, Wang Di shared the new book at Xing Bookstore in Chengdu &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Southern People Weekly reporter Wei Yi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Di thought of his past. When the college entrance examination was resumed in 1977, Wang Di happened to be on a business trip in Shanghai. He has returned to Chengdu to work for two years. Before that, he worked in the countryside in Meishan, Su Dongpo&#39;s hometown. His elder brother had already gone to the Yunnan Production and Construction Corps. He could not have gone to the countryside, but if he didn&#39;t go to the countryside, there would be no future and no job arrangement. &quot;I still want to go to the countryside. If I go to the countryside, I may have the opportunity to be recommended to go to university.&quot; Wang Di volunteered to go to the countryside and performed very well, but still did not get the chance to be recommended to go to university. In 1975, through recruitment, he returned to Chengdu and joined the Brick and Tile Factory of the Machinery Branch of the Chengdu Railway Bureau. &quot;Burning bricks and tiles is absolutely hard physical labor.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I am in the brick kiln class. The brick kiln is oval, and the fire is eternal. Along the edge of the fire, there are many kiln fire cycles. After entering, it is like a tunnel. You transport bricks out of the kiln. In this weather, dog days, when you go in, the fire is It was hot. I only wore shorts and a mask when I went in. I was covered in sweat. Only my two eyes were exposed. The kiln dust was very heavy. Several people piled bricks up, the rhythm was as fast as doing exercise. At that time, the food stamps were rationed. Ordinary residents were given 26 kilograms per month. Because we were doing heavy manual labor, the food stamps were 46 kilograms. When you see this comparison, you know how heavy this labor is. Generally, factories work on an 8-hour working day, but we work on a 4-hour working day because we can&#39;t be too tired. This is a place no one wants to go. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After working in the brick factory for more than a year, Wang Di was transferred to the labor union because he could draw. He painted many paintings and painted many slogans. He wanted to be a painter but had no chance. He failed to become a painter, but this amateur skill still gave him the opportunity to escape from heavy manual labor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The changing times gave him the opportunity to go to college. When China and the United States established diplomatic relations, he truly felt that times had changed. Wang Di, who had just entered college, wrote the following words in his diary on December 16, 1978: &quot;What an outstanding initiative and a great step. China and the United States have officially established diplomatic relations. The grievances accumulated over the years will be It was quickly eliminated. In the morning, we were in the political and economics class in the first teaching building. When we heard this important news, everyone flushed with excitement. When we heard that Vice Chairman Deng would visit the United States in January next year, we all clapped. This fully illustrates the will of the people.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/Xspu7YCSZb2PIyHt7ntjioMvMMeTtwV4asBjCpVg.jpg&quot; border=&quot; 0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;455&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/Xspu7YCSZb2PIyHt7ntjioMvMMeTtwV4asBjCpVg.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252388&quot;>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wang Di’s graduation photo from the History Department of Sichuan University&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture )&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although many years have passed, the scene of that day is still imprinted in Wang Di&#39;s mind. More than two hundred people from the 77th and 78th classes of the History Department took political economics classes in the largest classroom in the first teaching building. Because it is a large class, the classroom has radio and amplification equipment. During the break, one of the students turned on the radio. Through the loudspeaker, everyone heard the news about the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States being broadcast by the Central People&#39;s Broadcasting Station. The noisy classroom fell silent, and then everyone applauded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The teaching building of the University of Macau is very quiet. An art exhibition by University of Macau faculty members is being held in the library. Three of Wang Di&#39;s paintings participated in the exhibition, but he was busy with work and had not seen them yet. He took us around the library several times before we found the exhibition hall. His paintings are placed in the most conspicuous position in the exhibition hall. The three portraits are of Fairbank, James Scott and Carlo Ginzburg, three scholars he admired. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When writing a preface to Barbara Tuchman&#39;s book Stilwell, Fairbank said: &quot;For a long time, the United States has tried to make China more like itself - this is a waste of time. Quixotic efforts, but failed many times, and now this kind of effort is rising again... &#39;In the end, China went its own way, as if Americans had never been there.&#39;&quot; Wang Di feels Fairbank&#39;s lifelong efforts were to strengthen the understanding and friendship between the people of China and the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Wang Di was teaching undergraduates at Texas A&amp;amp;M University, he collected American media reports on the May Fourth Movement so that students could write papers based on these original materials. These sources, to his surprise, were largely unused by historians. &quot;The American media mainly reports on major events in China, and also includes some introductions and analyzes of Chinese society and culture, as well as China&#39;s economy and education. The personal records I used and the media interviews with individuals are from their The China you see with your own eyes has details, stories, and feelings, which to a large extent make up for the lack of personal destiny and experience behind major events.&quot; Wang Di has always emphasized individuals and details. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Macao is one of the important birthplaces of the Revolution of 1911. Sun Yat-sen practiced medicine here, and there is a statue of Sun Yat-sen in front of Jinghu Hospital. Wang Di recommended me to visit Morrison&#39;s tomb. &quot;It&#39;s near the White Pigeon Nest, and it has a sense of history.&quot; When Wang Di&#39;s historian friends Yang Nianqun and Sun Jiang came to Macau, he took them there. Morrison edited and published the first English-Chinese dictionary, the Chinese-English Dictionary, was the first to translate the Bible into Chinese, and opened the first clinic integrating Chinese and Western medicine in Macau. He is a pioneering figure in Sino-Western exchanges, and Macao has historically been a bridgehead for Sino-Western exchanges. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the residence of the University of Macau, a waterway passes through the sea under the balcony. On one side of the sea is Macau and on the other side is Zhuhai. Seeing the coast reminds Wang Di of his fishing days in the United States. He has two major hobbies: fishing and growing vegetables. He planted many things on the balcony - Tianqi, cucumbers, fungus... and put aside his hobby of fishing. &quot;It&#39;s not always good for a professor to fish on the coast next to the university.&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(laughing)&lt;/span>; On his balcony, he I never saw anyone fishing on the tidal flats. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Di has taught at universities in mainland China and the United States. Now that he has come to Macau, he feels that he has gained another perspective on thinking about history. Being at the junction of China and the West is helpful to his research. During the three years of the epidemic, many academic conferences have been suspended. After having this meal with us in Macau, Wang Di is going to Hong Kong to attend a meeting of Chinese and foreign historians. The conference does not require everyone to write a paper, but just talks about some recent ideas. Wang Di plans to take a bus to Hong Kong and take the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Reading&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In Macau, Wang Di rarely went to teahouses. He likes roadside stalls. He introduced us to a shop near White Pigeon Nest to eat curry beef soup. &quot;The shop is right on the street, and diners eat on the street. It&#39;s delicious. I eat it every time I pass by.&quot; Children who come from such a shop facing the street, in the words of Wang Di&#39;s classmate Wang Hai, are &quot;street eaters.&quot; Baby&quot;. Wang Hai said that he is a &quot;street kid&quot;. Unlike Wang Di who grew up in a compound, &quot;street kid&quot; needs stronger ability to get around. Wang Hai feels that artists can get away with it, but historians cannot. This is the difference between the two. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few years ago, Wang Di had a conversation with Liushahe, which made him feel nervous. When he was a child, he and Liushahe lived in the courtyard of the Sichuan Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and he and his brother would go to Liushahe to listen to stories. Also living in this courtyard are Sha Ting, Ai Wu and others. Wang Di&#39;s historical writing has literary and aesthetic self-requirements, which is probably related to the influence of the humanistic environment he grew up in. But those were not peaceful days. When he wanted to study, he had to sneak into the library of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles Library. It was an era when reading was like a thief. Wang Di only attended elementary school for three years, and did not complete middle school or high school. In high school, due to political review, he almost lost the opportunity to enter a higher education. But his habit of reading helped him. When the college entrance examination suddenly resumed, he was not so unprepared. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the college entrance examination was resumed in 1977, Wang Di was 21 years old and working in the railway bureau trade union. Train tickets are free and you can walk everywhere. The union provides good benefits and will be allocated some scarce goods. His parents felt that the job at the Railway Bureau was an iron rice bowl. Even if he went to college, the job assigned after graduation would not necessarily be better than it is now. They suggested that he wait for another two years. After working for five years, he could study with pay, and he could return to school after graduation. original unit. After listening to his parents&#39; advice, Wang Di did not take the college entrance examination in 1977. On the day of the college entrance examination, he happened to be on a business trip to Shanghai. Although he was a worker at that time, he &quot;worked for work&quot;, that is, doing cadre work as a worker, which seemed quite comfortable. In Shanghai, he happened to see candidates entering the college entrance examination examination room. Such a scene is a stimulus to him. He felt very lost, &quot;a feeling of being abandoned by the times.&quot; At that moment, he decided that he must take the exam next year, &quot;I can&#39;t wait any longer.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He prepared secretly and did not dare to tell his parents. &quot;What if I give up again if they try to persuade me?&quot; At that time, he lived in a work unit and went home once a week. He didn&#39;t mention it when he got back, and only told his parents after the exam. The parents are still very happy. My grades were pretty good, and I did particularly well on the history test. I originally wanted to study Chinese, but actually I still wanted to draw. I felt that studying Chinese and art had something to do with it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I first met Wang Di at Chengdu Heming Tea House, he had just attended the 40th anniversary party of his college classmates the night before. Students still remember that Wang Di was the first student admitted to the History Department of Sichuan University in 1978. He scored 96 out of 100 points in history. When he went to report, it was No. 1. &quot;Actually, I didn&#39;t know what historical research was at that time. I just liked reading some history books.&quot; The composition of my college classmates was very complicated. When I first entered school, the youngest student in the class was 16 years old and the oldest was 32 years old. &quot;Now I can&#39;t tell my age, almost all of them are retired. There are groups of students who specialize in traveling, groups that specialize in drinking, and groups that specialize in playing mahjong.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among college classmates like Wang Di are still there There are very few people working. Wang Di is a chair professor at the University of Macau and can retire at the age of 70. For the 40th anniversary party, the students planned to go to Anren Town for two days. Wang Di has something to do and has to return to Macau. The classmates in Chengdu decided to get together in Chengdu one day in advance in order to meet Wang Di. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Di behaves in a low-key manner. Every time he returns to Chengdu, he comes and leaves quietly. This time I returned to Chengdu, there were many public events, and I couldn’t hide them. Everyone gathered together. &quot;I don&#39;t want to be the protagonist and let others do the activities for you.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He went to see his parents. My parents are in their nineties and live in a nursing home. A large number of books in Chengdu had been unused for many years, so he donated them to Sichuan University and let the graduate students divide them. Now, he misses those books a little bit. It was with those books that he wrote his first book - &quot;Out of the Closed World&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After so many years abroad, he used the newly collected research materials to write &quot;Street Culture&quot;, &quot;Brother Pao&quot;, &quot;Teahouse&quot; and other works. Chengdu Shuangliu District is currently preparing to build a Wang Di Documentation Center. The materials he collected will be placed here in the future and can be used by other researchers in need. Wang Di just visited this place. The documentation center has two floors and is very beautiful. Wang Hai is helping him do this. Wang Hai appeared in many of Wang Di&#39;s activities. He has a completely opposite personality to Wang Di. Even the word &quot;social cow&quot; is not enough to describe him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Macau, there are not many books on Wang Di’s bookshelf. He hardly collects books now. They are too heavy and inconvenient for him to use often. He mainly reads e-books and often listens to books. He has bad eyesight. He showed me the e-books he was reading, including Scott, Hayek, Wang Dingjun, and the newly minted Nobel Prize winner in Literature Anne Ernault. He wanted to tell the story of &quot;Tea House&quot; in the voice of a virtual century-old man, similar to Ernault&#39;s &quot;Unauthorized Autobiography&quot; in &quot;Years of Time&quot;. While Erno recalls himself, he also triggers the memories of others, and the resonance of memories shows the evolution of the times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Di has been looking for these resonant moments in his memory. A lot of these moments are sinking. For example, when he was making bricks in a brick and tile factory, he was crowded into a large shed with twenty or thirty workers and had no private space of his own. While the workers were sleeping, he read under the lamp, but no one said that he kept the lamp on so late that it affected their sleep. The workers also made him a table out of scrap wood so that he could read and draw. &quot;It&#39;s probably the experience during that period that had a subtle influence on my later public view of history and the perspective of the lower class.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Youxing Bookstore, Wang Di talked about his generation, both Urban intellectuals who have been farmers and workers may be a unique generation in Chinese history. At the age of 22 - neither too early nor too late - he passed the sudden college entrance examination and turned his destiny around. At the age of 31, he became the youngest associate professor in the history department of a Chinese university at that time. When everything seemed to be going smoothly, he made the decision to go to the United States to study for graduate school and start over. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;In the United States&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When Wang Di, associate professor of the History Department of Sichuan University, was preparing to continue his studies abroad, he received admission notices from the history departments of two American universities. One is Johns Hopkins University and the other is Columbia University. He chose the former and studied for a doctorate with the famous American historian William Rowe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;William Luo recommended Wang Di to read &quot;Cheese and Maggots&quot; by Carlo Ginzburg. This is Wang Di’s first time reading a micro-historical work. Ginzburg used the Inquisition archives to write the spiritual history of Menocchio, a small rural miller in northern Italy in the 16th century. Menocchio saw the universe as a piece of cheese riddled with maggots. The original work is in Italian, and the English version Wang Di read happens to be published by Johns Hopkins University Press. He read this micro-history classic countless times, and later in the New Cultural History discussion class he taught, he went over the details of the book with his students again and again. He believes that such intensive reading and discussion are more useful than giving students a long book list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Di writes micro history. His three major topics were fully discussed with William Luo. When William Luo teaches his students, he doesn’t just tell them what he is good at, and then just let the students write about what they are good at. &quot;The students themselves have to have this impulse, and the teacher helps to deepen it. It does not mean that the teacher has a big idea and then assigns it to the students.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he discussed writing his doctoral thesis with William Luo, there was no &quot; The word &quot;street culture&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(street culture)&lt;/span>;. &quot;I introduced this concept first, and he said yes. I think students should think independently and deepen continuously. The teacher should make the problem concrete, rather than letting the teacher think for him.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Di has been practicing this Take a microscopic view of history. He feels that this requires more adaptation and understanding for us readers who are accustomed to historical writing having great significance and grand narratives. It’s not about more and more detailed historical writing, it’s about micro history. &quot;If we write a book about Zeng Guofan or Hu Shi, no matter how detailed and detailed it is, it will not be what we call micro history. One of the prerequisites of micro history is to write the history of ordinary people.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ginzburg advocated paying attention to &quot;the persecuted and subjugated people&quot; because these people are often &quot;dismissed or even completely ignored by many historians as marginal figures.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Wang Di was writing his doctoral thesis &quot;Street Culture&quot; using micro-historical methods, his supervisor William Luo was writing &quot;Salvation - Chen Hongmou and the Elite Consciousness of Eighteenth-Century China&quot;. William Luo believes that this Qing Dynasty official, who was born in Hengshan Village, Lingui, Guangxi, can see the mentality of the elite at that time. This is a model of &quot;managing the world&quot; and the epitome of the prosperous Qing Dynasty. Obviously the research that Wang Di is interested in is different, but this does not prevent them from going to the Library of Congress to look up materials together. &quot;This may be the place with the most books and materials in the world.&quot; Luo William went to find Chen Hongmou, and Wang Di went to the teahouse. William Luo would ask Wang Di how to translate these lines of Chen Hongmou&#39;s poems appropriately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/6ctY5BDmIsGaal8JWH6ziptVp4brWrixf8H8sMXY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/6ctY5BDmIsGaal8JWH6ziptVp4brWrixf8H8sMXY.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252390&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wang Di shared with readers in Chengdu&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Hua Xiaofeng/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;William Luo He expressed his thoughts in the introduction to &quot;Salvation&quot;: &quot;Now it seems that narrative works and intensive reading of historical texts are completely necessary. The emphasis on micro history has made the detailed study of the personal lives of historical figures extremely valuable. High status. &quot;Cheese and Maggots&quot; by Italian historian Carlo Ginzburg is a classic in micro-historical research. This makes me suspect that in this era, a scholar spent a lot of time studying a male elite Is it the most effective way to do research with an important political figure? Many articles published by Giovanni Levi, a high-spirited Italian historian, in the &quot;Annals&quot; eloquently prove: Those who study big figures, such as Proper treatment, like the study of small figures, can help us understand past history.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people will also think that Wang Di&#39;s micro-historical research is similar to another historian Yang Nianqun&#39;s study of emperors. research will produce conflicts and contradictions. Wang Di doesn&#39;t see it that way. &quot;Actually, what we are saying is not contradictory. History is indeed determined by emperors and elites in many cases. He is telling the truth, but what I express is a view of history. Those who rule people should study it, and the people who are ruled should also study it. Yang Nianqun Studying the emperor does not mean that he agrees with the emperor&#39;s approach.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Di learned a lot from William Luo, including that a mentor does not dominate everything. Wang Di now teaches students New Cultural History at the University of Macau. Read original English works such as &quot;Cheese and Maggots&quot; by Ginzburg and &quot;The Return of Martin Guerre&quot; by Natalie Zemon Davis. Read a book every two weeks, 3 hours a week, and discuss a book 6 hours a week. He works out every detail with his students. He encourages students to think independently and put forward different opinions to teachers with reason and evidence. Sometimes the opinions are right, but sometimes they are not necessarily right. The opinions of both teachers and students are not unquestionable. &quot;This is a way of dialogue, not to prove who is right or wrong. Sometimes everyone uses the same information in different ways. There are multiple perspectives for interpreting history, but everything is based on careful reading. Go up.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As mentioned before, Wang Di also received an admission notice from the History Department of Columbia University that year. The person who admitted him was historian Zeng Xiaoping &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (Madeleine Zelin) &lt;/span>;. Her representative work is &quot;Zigong Merchants: Entrepreneurs in Early Modern China&quot; 》. When Wang Di&#39;s doctoral thesis &quot;Street Culture&quot; was published by Stanford University Press, one of the anonymous external reviewers was Zeng Xiaoping. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/DGR4RJsBSdLmhTvu9Dw6YAKtsXlcI4mdZ4e3SaqI.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/DGR4RJsBSdLmhTvu9Dw6YAKtsXlcI4mdZ4e3SaqI.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252389&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wang Di growing vegetables on the balcony&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Fang Yingzhong/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Zeng Xiaoping wrote six or seven pages of comments for &quot;Street Culture&quot;, which is equivalent to a small essay. She gave Wang Di many suggestions for revision, one of which was: the point of view of this book is not very clear. This troubled Wang Di. &quot;I asked William Luo how to highlight the main points. William Luo told me a method. He said, you use one sentence to summarize each chapter, and then you combine these words in each chapter into a paragraph, and the theme of that paragraph This sentence is your main point. This is amazing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2005, &quot;Street Culture&quot; won the Best Book Award from the American Society for Urban History Research. Wang Di is grateful to both Zeng Xiaoping and Luo William. He has benefited a lot from the strict review questions and the effective methods to solve them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;William Luo is over seventy years old, less than ten years older than Wang Di. Sometimes, Wang Di would ask William Luo for advice. 2019, co-recommended by William Luo and his colleague Tobie Meyer-Fong at Hopkins University , Wang Di was selected as the school&#39;s outstanding alumnus &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Soecity of Scholars)&lt;/span>;, which is a great honor. Wang Di was originally going to the United States to attend an awards ceremony and attend a dinner hosted by the principal in the spring of 2020. He had invited William Luo to attend, but due to epidemic restrictions, he was unable to make the trip. This was his biggest regret during the epidemic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the American history community, it is not easy for Chinese professors to gain recognition. Wang Di talked about He Bingdi and Huang Renyu, thinking that they are two extreme examples of Chinese American historical scholars. &quot;He Bingdi&#39;s research method is orthodox in the field of American history. He pays attention to empirical evidence and can be recognized professionally. He has had a smooth sailing. He served as the president of the Asia Society of America in the 1970s. This is not easy. Huang Renyu is the other extreme. His The book is written in the style of big history, such as &quot;The Fifteen Years of Wanli&quot;, which lacks a basis for case study and is difficult to be accepted by American historians. Therefore, the publication of his book in the United States suffered many setbacks, and in the end he even lost his teaching position. Huang Renyu&#39;s books span thousands of years and are very comfortable to read. Today, Huang Renyu&#39;s reputation among readers is far greater than that of He Bingdi, and &quot;Yellow River and Green Mountains&quot; is more shocking to read than &quot;Sixty Years of Reading History and Reading the World&quot;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;When Wang Di taught at Texas A&amp;M University, he was the only Chinese professor in the history department. As he gets older, the biggest headache for Wang Di is the inconvenient transportation. There is an airport in the university. If he wants to return to China, he needs to take a small plane from the university town to Houston, Austin or Dallas, then fly to Los Angeles or San Francisco, and then fly to Beijing or Shanghai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He has taught in the United States for 17 years, from assistant professor to full professor, and felt that he needed to change his environment. When the University of Macau offered him an olive branch, he accepted it and came to the University of Macau in 2015. After a year of adapting, he stayed and served as chairman of the History Department of the University of Macau and as a chair professor to this day. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Rolling waves&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In Macau, Wang Di often eats in the canteen, or solves problems at home with noodles and frozen dumplings. When I occasionally cook Sichuan cuisine, I take the simplest approach and use hot pot base ingredients to cook various side dishes. The Hengqin campus of the University of Macau is connected to Macau through an undersea tunnel. It is like a small society, so Wang Di can stay away from the hustle and bustle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;His desk faces the balcony diagonally, and the ship outside the floor-to-ceiling window passes through the traffic artery of reality and history. He seems to be living between history and reality. He is a scholar who has both a sense of history and a sense of reality. He hopes to use his thinking about history to make sense of the present. &quot;History is full of contingency and has no rules, but history can help us think.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many pictures and photos on the wall outside Wang Di&#39;s office, including an introduction to his professional research and photos of his daily life. One of the photos is from a college class reunion in 2000. The students are playing mahjong. Wang Di cannot play mahjong, and before studying teahouses, he rarely went to teahouses. He doesn&#39;t look like a typical Chengdu person. Maybe a &quot;street kid&quot; like his classmate Wang Hai is. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Di may have wanted to be a painter more than Wang Hai. His illustrations often appear in his books, such as the Heming Teahouse where we are chatting. He drew one based on the photo. He drew many portraits for &quot;The Whisper of History&quot;. &quot;This is in line with my philosophy. They are people I admire. I draw ideas and reflections from them. To display these requires artistic techniques and some illustrations. I don&#39;t like to simply put photos. &quot;The Tea Shop on the Corner &quot;I also drew illustrations. The idea of ​​drawing illustrations was a consensus reached by me and Li Lei, the editor in charge of these two books.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Over the years, Wang Di has published many books in China, many of which You need to queue up to get to each publishing house to avoid crashing on the press. He is very satisfied with the &quot;Wang Di&#39;s Works Series&quot; being launched by the People&#39;s Literature Publishing House. &quot;The editor-in-chief Li Lei thought of a lot of options just for the title of each book. In terms of literary expression and public reading and promotion, it is also He gave me a lot of tips and suggestions, and arranged a conversation between me and Xu Jilin at the Shanghai Book Fair, as well as Zhang Mingyang and I’s activities in Sinan, Shanghai.” Wang Di said that in the United States for more than 20 years, the things he published were not many. &quot;I went to the United States in 1991. By 2015, I had only published two English books and one Chinese book in 24 years. It was very few, but a lot of things were accumulated, and after accumulation, they would explode.&quot; Wang Di is 67 years old this year . There is a saying that the age between 60 and 70 is the golden period for a historian. Wang Di is in such a period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the way to Heming Tea House, he had been listening to books. &quot;I have bad eyesight, so I keep my eyes open for writing.&quot; He is a person who cherishes time. When he gets up in the morning, he rinses his mouth and brushes his teeth, cooks and eats, and listens to books. He said that his life is composed of three books: writing, reading, and teaching. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Macau, following Wang Di’s instructions, I found Morrison’s tomb in the corner behind a church in front of White Pigeon Nest. On the site in front of the tomb, there were several workers pulling wires to measure. It was estimated that the church and cemetery needed repairs. A few children were playing football in front of the church, and they would run over only when the ball went into the yard. The area in front of the White Pigeon Nest is a public space, and most of the people here are old people playing chess. Tradition is as solid as stone. Wang Di said that similar scenes can be seen in Hong Kong and San Francisco. Some of the components of public space that are inherited from tradition do not change with time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2023, I also saw people playing chess in front of the Guanyin Pavilion Teahouse in Peng Town, Shuangliu, Chengdu. They sat there all morning. Wang Di&#39;s &quot;Teahouse&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Part 2)&lt;/span>;&quot; recounts Zhang Rong&#39;s memories in &quot;Hong: The Story of Three Generations of Chinese Women&quot;. Many teahouses in Chengdu were forcibly closed at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. &quot;One boy even lifted the chessboard and all the chess pieces fell on the floor, shouting: &#39;No chess! Don&#39;t you know this is a bourgeois hobby?&#39; Then he threw the chess pieces and the board into the river. Some students were in the teahouse. Paint slogans on the walls.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the &quot;Destroy the Four Olds&quot; movement, teahouses were impacted, where drinking tea &quot;was seen as a bad habit of the old society, and tea shops were seen as harboring dirt and evil. The teahouses were forcibly banned and closed down as a gathering place for class dissidents and backward masses.” At this time, Laohu Zao still played an important role in the lives of Chengdu residents. In the 1960s, Chengdu residents were short of fuel at home, so the boiling water provided by Laohu Zao was more convenient and cheaper than boiling water themselves. There are fewer people drinking tea in teahouses, but the number of people buying boiled water to make tea at home has not decreased.茶铺起到水铺的作用。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在茶馆研究的问题上，王笛关心的是，是否地区或地方的研究可以提供理解中国社会和文化的普遍性知识。 “微观研究的意义在于，能够为把对历史的认识上升到一个更广义的层次提供个案分析，其不仅能丰富我们对地方的知识，而且有助于我们对中国的理解。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;国家与社会关系问题，是西方研究中国历史的一个着眼点。在1980年代末和1990年代初，罗威廉使用公共领域&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（public sphere）&lt;/span>;这一概念来研究近代中国时，遭到不少学者反对，他们认为哈贝马斯的概念不适用于中国。 “20世纪下半叶的中国有相当长一段时间，便处于有&#39;国家&#39;无&#39;社会&#39;的时代，国家掌握了政治、经济、社会、文化的一切资源，这是此前任何政权未能实现的。传统的&#39;公&#39;的领域也几乎不复存在。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;姜文导演的《让子弹飞》已然是当代中国电影的经典之作，其中的桥段脍炙人口，在各种社交场合被频频引用。电影改编自马识途《夜谭十记》中的《盗官记》。在《盗官记》里，有这么一段对成都茶馆的细致描述：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你们去过成都吗？那里有一个少城公园，少城公园里有一个鹤鸣茶社。在那里有一块颇大的空坝子，都盖着凉棚，面临绿水涟漪，是个好的风景去处。凉棚下摆满茶桌和竹椅，密密麻麻坐满喝茶的茶客，热闹得很。到处听到互相打招呼、寒暄问好的声音，到处是茶倌放下铜盘叫着“开水”的声音。这是一个普通的茶座，那些做小生意的、当教员的等等小市民们，就在这里来谋事，说合，讲交情，做买卖，吵架，扯皮，参加“六腊之战”，“吃讲茶”……&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是曾经的鹤鸣茶社，许多情状还在，许多则已成往事。比如说“六腊之战”，指的是每年六月和腊月是学校教员受聘期满的月份，教员们为了争取继续聘用，四处奔走，为生活而战。 “吃讲茶”则是双方发生争执时，会请袍哥主持公道，双方在茶馆谈判，或和或打，就看这茶吃得怎样。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/SM7mhTluQgqDzzOqCC5msjUxrmhRjmqhEIuapyiR.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;王笛在成都鹤鸣茶社拍摄茶客&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（华小峰/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;马识途的小说写的是民国时的事情。 1949年之后，马识途的回忆是这样的：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;既然茶馆不再是能支持革命的地方，我们必须坚决地消除它们。因此，茶馆倒闭了。尽管人们不喜欢这种不便，但他们除了无条件服从外，无能为力。实际上，一些有识之士认为我们可以取茶馆之益而去其之弊，当然，这样的话，茶馆的弊处将会完全被消除，茶馆将成为一个文化活动中心以及宣传教育的场所。但当局没有听见这些声音，因此，茶馆在四川大地上几乎消失殆尽。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王笛觉得鹤鸣茶社的历史几乎可以单独提出来独立成书，鹤鸣茶社的历史就是一部波澜起伏的电影，而不同人的眼中，有不同的茶和历史——&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;看到同样的历史资料，人和人理解不一样。我们今天在鹤鸣茶社，可能不同的人有不同的感受。有的人可能看到脏乱差，有的人看到的是人和人在聊天社交，有的人看到茶倌在忙着掺茶，有的是看到谋生的人，有的看到掏耳朵的人，有的是看到我们在这聊天，摆着书，还有人在旁边照相。每个人看到的都不一样。本来这就是一个大千世界。卡尔·波普尔说，我们写不出整体的历史，包括鹤鸣茶社，我们都写不出整体的历史。我们看到的只是通过个体的眼睛，或者个体的研究者来理解的历史，任何历史都只是部分的历史。每个人写的都是碎片，不可能是全面的历史。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;有的人说成都很好啊，有的人说成都就是大家无所事事。同样的事情，有的是积极的，有的是消极的。大家的经历不一样。有的工作很满意，有的始终找不到好工作，能说感受是一样的吗？历史就这样复杂，没有标准，也没有规律。相信历史有规律是很可怕的事情。过去的三年，病毒让全球都改变了。这有什么必然性啊。三年前，没有人预见得到疫情对世界的改变。所谓规律，是可以预见到的未来，历史真的不是这样的，很多时候只是人的一念之差。我们的现代社会，整个人类文明，不是人为设计的，一个社会自然进化可能更合理。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王笛从鹤鸣茶社旁边人头攒动的餐饮店里买了几碗水饺，这是我们的午餐。他说起吃的历史。 “我读幼儿园的时候，吃不饱饭，我还记得，小孩子跟着老师去其他班看看有没有剩下的饭，没有啊。这样的饿肚子的事情，就是人为设计的结果。”王笛生于1956年。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他表达了他对整个中国历史的看法。 “我们要让社会充分发展。举个简单的例子，如果大家都在泰坦尼克号这样的大船上，如果在正确的航道上，大家没感觉有什么，一旦出现问题，大家就都完蛋。如果我们分乘50条船往前走，看起来缺乏效率，但哪一种选择更安全，这是非常简单的道理。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在《茶馆&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（上）&lt;/span>;》的尾声，王笛用了《寻梦》作为标题。他用非常感性的笔触描述了1949年的最后一天：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;在过去的50年里，他们所光顾的茶馆，他们视为理所当然的坐茶馆的生活习惯，竟一直是国家权力与地方社会、文化的同一性和独特性较量的“战场”。他们每天到茶馆吃茶，竟然就是他们拿起“弱者的武器”所进行的“弱者的反抗”。这也即是说，弱小而手无寸铁的茶馆经理人、堂倌和茶客们，在这50年的反复鏖战中，任凭茶碗中波澜翻滚，茶桌上风云变幻，他们犹如冲锋陷阵的勇士，为茶馆和日常文化的最终胜利，立下了汗马功劳。如果他们知道自己在捍卫地方文化中所扮演的关键角色，就不会嘲笑这位通过时间机器突然降临、要为他们撰写历史的小同乡了。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“小同乡”指的是王笛自己。 2023年9月，王笛第九次来到成都双流彭镇观音阁茶馆，时间机器仿佛再次启程。他毫无意外地再次看到了在那里打牌的甘大爷和胡大爷。老板李强用老虎灶上取下来的水壶给他们的茶杯里倒入鲜开水，波澜翻滚。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在王笛叙述的那些试图改变世界的大人物眼中，他们想着的是世界的波澜翻滚，而不是这碗茶。王笛在《历史的微声》最后一章中，提到了他脑海里浮现过的一个画面：“帝王或者英雄站在高高的山巅上，俯瞰整个大地，为自己马上要创造历史，而心潮澎湃，豪情万丈。极目望去，在他的眼中，是乌泱泱的人海，芸芸众生，小如蝼蚁。对他来说，面对这样的人海，多一个不多，少一个也不少，个体在这里已经失去了意义；个体的命运，在这里是无关大局的；芸芸众生之间，是没有区别的，甚至看不清他们的面孔。他们没有自己的故事，也没有自己的历史，当然也就没有自己的未来。如果这些芸芸众生为了帝王或者英雄所谓的&#39;宏大事业&#39;而死去，就无声无息地化为了尘土。在宏大的历史叙事中，个体是整体完全可以忽视的东西，这就是整体史的本质。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在观音阁茶馆，王笛走到甘大爷和胡大爷旁边，再次拍下了许多照片。而正在打牌的两位大爷对此习以为常，连眼皮都没抬一下。每天上午都出现在茶馆里，用一杯一块钱的茶度过一个上午，这样波澜不惊的生活也许才是最正常最让人安心的生活。王笛告诉我，“人民能够日复一日、年复一年预期到他们能够过着安静和平的生活，难道这不就是最宏大的叙事吗？”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;真实是什么？ &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;王笛在办公室收到了四川大学学报寄给他的期刊。期刊的开篇便是他写的论文《“啯匪”和“会匪”：哥老会起源的新思考》。秘密会社一直是他所关心的主题。当年的《袍哥》是这一研究过程中的插曲。和袍哥有关的大量材料需要更丰富的形式来表现。对沈宝媛论文的研究，更像是对《奶酪与蛆虫》的一次具体的借鉴。 “原本并不打算写微观史，只是正好有这么一个资料。”意大利偏远地区的故事勾起他对四川乡下一起案件的联系。这正说明文明当中的许多形式具有共性，我们跟世界并不是那么不一样。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最近他会写到“三支半香”，会写到哥老会现实和精神的起源。他会运用霍布斯鲍姆《传统的发明》所提到的理念。袍哥联系着更繁复而未明的历史。如何认识这些故事，如何认识文本，如何认识档案，是重要的事情。 “不要认为记载在档案上的东西就是历史。档案的真实性并不比别人写的小说更真实。”王笛说起二十四史。 “二十四史就是官修的历史。这是皇帝希望我们相信的历史。许多历史经过伪造、修改，甚至销毁。如果没有二十四史，今天留给我们的历史，也许不是更少，而是更多。这些官修的历史有多少真实性？我敢说百分之一的真实性都没有。官修的历史只能代表官方，跟每个人的经历有出入。我反复强调，一个学者要有批判精神，包括对史料和历史写作的批判，没有批判的话，你的写作没有任何意义。当然，每个人都没法写出完全真实的历史，我们只是力图写出接近真实的历史。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/TTdxD1WmktHHLBUgJQWhAr8LLxHBF2fPhclLVsnm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/TTdxD1WmktHHLBUgJQWhAr8LLxHBF2fPhclLVsnm.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252384&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;王笛在澳门大学校园里&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（南方人物周刊记者方迎忠/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我和王笛站在下班高峰期的成都合江亭附近的路边等车。往西边走一段路，就到新南门。以前，成都还有城墙城门城楼的时候，南门叫“江桥”，南城楼是“浣溪”。顺着锦江往西边的方向看，看到的是和其他城市差不多的天际线，看不出这是成都。往东不远的地方是九眼桥遗迹。成都许多地方只剩下一个地名。那些貌似还在的地方，跟往年已经不一样。锦里、宽窄巷子好像是古色古香的街道，但保留下来的东西并不多。王笛原本住在大慈寺对面，庙里曾经有一个文博大茶园，“非常壮观”。他觉得这里曾是最有成都茶馆文化特色的地方，但已经有了翻天覆地的变化，成了太古里。文博大茶园长大的孩子和太古里长大的孩子看到的成都，哪个更真实？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;成都是和茶馆相连的，茶馆让成都成为成都。 “到口子上啖三花”曾经是成都人的口头禅，就像北京人说“您吃了吗”一样。不一定真的去喝茶或吃饭。一种可以成为日常口语的指代物，说明这件事情在日常生活中的重要。在口子上，在街角，那种传统茶铺不好找了。所以，游客们会去双流彭镇的茶馆打卡。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王笛在观音阁茶馆门口跟老板李强聊起过去。他觉得观音阁茶馆现在的“两张皮”挺好。 “一张皮”是网红打卡之地。他们在这里喝一碗茶10块钱，买了茶可以喝茶休息拍照。 “另一张皮”是当地茶客的日常生活，以甘大爷和胡大爷每天雷打不动出现在茶馆为标志，他们用的是大茶杯，茶叶不一样，1块钱。两者相辅相成，构成了一个传统和现实融合的空间。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这里是成都历史为数不多的“活化石”之一。未硬化的室内泥地，土木结构的空间，竹椅、温水瓶、茶碗、老虎灶，各种嘈杂声随之而来。这是现实的声音，也是历史的回声。这是王笛所说的“历史的微声”。这里，普通的个体不是一个个抽象数字，而是一个个具体的人。他们喝着茶，打着牌，聊着天，将生活日复一日地进行下去。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;
