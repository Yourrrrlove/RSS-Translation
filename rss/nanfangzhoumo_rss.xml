The scenery I experienced on the road was ever-changing. It was both Tibet and Inner Mongolia. Finally, like Yunnan, Yadong County is known as &quot;Tibet&#39;s Little Jiangnan&quot;. Yadong County is located at the junction of China, India, and Bhutan. It is located at the southern foot of the middle section of the Himalayas. It is only 2,700 meters above sea level. The air is humid and the vegetation is very lush. The deeper you go, the more you feel like you are in a virgin forest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Yadong&quot; in Tibetan means &quot;whirlpool&quot; or &quot;deep valley of rapids&quot;. As its name suggests, Yadong County is located in a ravine, and the Yadong River surges along the county. As a border county, Yadong used to be a trade channel between China and India. I wanted to visit the border during this trip, and Yadong, with its unique location, became my first choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“When traveling to Yadong, you must take the government’s tourist bus.” Before departure, the owner of the B&amp;B in Shigatse reminded me this, which made me, who is used to traveling independently, even more curious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/XdzvjF4pyO0UTZkhW2UYQN25VIJedB4W5BVV606I.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/XdzvjF4pyO0UTZkhW2UYQN25VIJedB4W5BVV606I.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260021&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Dromulari Snow Mountain near Pali Town&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Wei/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;Arrived at the local area, the mystery is gradually revealed. In May this year, the local government wanted to develop tourism and opened a tourist line to take tourists to Nathula National Gate and other scenic spots for free. Visitors only need to reserve seats in advance and purchase travel insurance of 1.5 yuan at their own expense. I added the staff on WeChat, sent my ID number and name, made an appointment for the next day’s trip, and purchased insurance at the hotel’s service desk. In Yadong, every hotel will provide government tour buses and purchase insurance information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Early the next morning, I set out for the bus boarding point. The county town is very small, and it takes less than half an hour to walk around. All four tourist buses were full, and each bus had a local tour guide. Our tour guide was a young Tibetan man with a cheerful personality. I learned in the subsequent chat that he is a local. He finished college in Lhasa, served as a soldier for two years, and is now back as a tour guide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first stop is Nathu La National Gate located at the junction of China and India. The tourist bus drove for more than half an hour, spiraling along the mountain road and arriving at an altitude of 4,300 meters. Nathu La Port is the highest road trade channel in the world. Currently, only government sightseeing vehicles can drive to the Nathu La National Gate, and private vehicles are prohibited from passing through. Taking pictures is also not allowed. The tour guide took away our mobile phones and ID cards for centralized management. After getting off the bus, tourists lined up in front of the country gate, and the tour guide took photos of everyone with their mobile phones. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/uPXYTeAtbeud0Qnzz4iRYPq9eo48XohRTmniPiBG.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/uPXYTeAtbeud0Qnzz4iRYPq9eo48XohRTmniPiBG.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260024&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The old Tibetan man herding cattle introduced me to the history of Pali Town&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Wei/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;I didn’t want to queue, so I walked into the &quot;International Mail Center&quot; near the country gate. This is an observatory where you can watch India on the opposite side. As I climbed up to the second floor, I saw some tourists who were panting and unable to walk, and some were holding oxygen tanks and breathing oxygen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Standing on the second floor, you can see the Indian National Gate opposite, which is less than 20 meters away. Several Indian soldiers are patrolling, and the surrounding bare mountains are dotted with Chinese and Indian bunkers. The young soldiers stationed in Nathu La told us that in July the mountains here are covered with thick white snow and red azaleas. He also said that tourists from India also come for sightseeing every day. They usually show up around 1 p.m. and stand on the observation deck opposite to watch China. At this time, a wild horse and a wild dog came down from the mountain opposite, causing people to make a noise. &quot;Is this from China or India?&quot; someone asked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I would not be able to reach these places by myself without a car. Tibet has huge mountains, and the sightseeing tour ended at 4 pm. The car spent two-thirds of the time traveling through the mountains. In addition to the Nathu La National Gate, we also visited the Kagyu Monastery, the border well-off village, Linhai Waterfall, etc. until we arrived. The end of the border between China, India and Bhutan. Along the way, the Yadong River also followed us, rushing forward along the road, and finally disappeared at the border of the three countries, entering India and Bhutan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the few days I arrived, roads were being built everywhere in Yadong County, and the roadbeds in front and behind the hotel were dug up. I didn’t stay long and decided to go to Pali Town, which is under the jurisdiction of the county. Compared with Yadong County, Pali Town makes me yearn for it more. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pali Town is known as the &quot;highest town in the world&quot;, and &quot;Pali&quot; means &quot;rotating mountains&quot; in Tibetan. It was once an important trading town in Tibet. When Yadong County was still a small village, the streets of Pali Town were already filled with caravan merchants and Khampa people from India, Nepal, and Bhutan. Hundreds of years ago, escaped serfs, missionary believers, and traders came to Pali grassland to seek life. Immigration drove the development of Pali. When the Yadong Port was closed in the 1960s (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Editor&#39;s note: it was reopened many years later with the improvement of Sino-Indian relations&lt;/span>;), commercial activities began decline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/nzbnjAjoWOUn4OY2jnzLV7BM597aPDz2hG7c5y9n.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/nzbnjAjoWOUn4OY2jnzLV7BM597aPDz2hG7c5y9n.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260025&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The remaining wall of the old house in Parry Town&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Wei/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Pali Town is only an hour&#39;s drive from Yadong County, but it is more than 4,300 meters above sea level and has a completely different climate from Yadong County. Pali Town is located in the vast Pali grassland. Not far away is the beautiful Zhuomulari Snow Mountain, so close that you can reach out and touch it. Around the highway, two-story residential buildings are neatly arranged. During the season when I arrived, golden rapeseed flowers and green grasslands spread out in layers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People who come to Pali Town are usually tourists passing through Yadong County. As soon as I got off the car, I was attracted by this quiet town. Walking through the small alleys, you can appreciate the strong atmosphere of life, Tibetan-style buildings built of stone, neatly placed cow dung on the courtyard walls, and bright window frames painted in red, green and blue. It only takes ten minutes to walk from the town to the grassland, and you will meet almost no people. You can only see a sheep herder and a man drying cow dung in the distance. There are only three hotels in the town, all run by Tibetans. Most of the rooms have no bathrooms. I chose the cheapest single room, and I could directly see the snow-capped mountains from the room window. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, most of the houses in Pali Town are newly built. I only encountered an old dilapidated house on the slope behind the town. The house was overgrown with weeds and half of the wall collapsed. A local old man saw that I was very interested in old houses and showed me old photos on his mobile phone. He also took me to visit several old houses. One of them had &quot;1958&quot; vaguely engraved on the old stone wall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 01 Dec 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“大气”成为评测的关键词？消费者购车不能只看颜值]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261530]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-01 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On social media, some people questioned the interior layout design of a certain brand of new car because the platform in front of the co-pilot It is designed as a storage table. However, the concept of vehicle safety has always been that other items cannot be placed on the center console because the airbag is underneath. Sufficient space must be left for the airbag to explode in the event of a traffic accident, otherwise it will cause damage to the vehicle. Secondary injury to personnel inside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, there are many such designs for electric vehicles. For example, car door handles must be highly reliable and can be opened under any circumstances. Mechanical ones are best, but now many cars use built-in door handles, and even electric ones. Once the car enters water, it loses power. , the car door cannot be opened from the outside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This phenomenon of over-innovation, or neglecting safety for the sake of innovation, is to some extent because China’s automobile consumer market is not mature enough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Car consumption requires certain professional knowledge. Cars are the crystallization of human technology and engineering. Each car has many parts that are precisely integrated together, and its operation involves a lot of professional knowledge. Every system and every component of the car has its specific function and role. The engine outputs power, which determines the power and performance of the car; the chassis is the skeleton of the car, which determines the car&#39;s handling and comfort; and the braking system, fuel system, cooling system, etc. ensure the normal operation of the car. These systems and components are interrelated and cooperate with each other to allow the car to operate normally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Industrial products have various parameters and technical characteristics. Cars are almost the most parameter-based things that ordinary people have access to. Understanding these parameters and performance can help consumers choose a car that suits them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Parameters such as engine capacity, power, torque, fuel consumption, suspension type, braking performance, tire specifications, etc., all directly affect the driving experience and driving safety. For ordinary consumers, if they want to buy a car that suits them, they need to learn and master certain professional knowledge, such as understanding the difference between three-link and five-link, which one is safer, disc brake or drum brake, electric vehicle There are also differences between lithium iron phosphate and ternary lithium batteries. This requires constant online searching and reading, which is too difficult a task for most people. On the one hand, this requires a certain cultural level to digest this knowledge; on the other hand, it requires a lot of time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are a lot of technical arguments under various car review videos on the Internet, but to some extent this is just an illusion. It is just people who understand technology gather under specific videos. Most people do not know how to do it. Get involved in this debate. They will say that such-and-such car has been reduced in price again, who will buy such a car, but they do not know that most Chinese consumers will not care about this at all. They are a minority among consumers and are not important to manufacturers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When consumers do not understand the technical parameters, manufacturers can attract consumers through things they can understand and guide them to see what to see or ignore. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In today&#39;s automobile market, many consumers tend to focus on the appearance, interior and intelligent systems of the car when buying a car, while ignoring the basic functions of the car, that is, the Ride, safety and handling performance. This phenomenon reflects to some extent modern people’s expectations and values ​​for cars, and also reveals certain problems in the automotive industry’s ability to meet consumer needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consumers are understandably concerned about the exterior and interior of their cars. China has just entered the era of automobile popularization. Cars are still very expensive and still have a strong identity function. Therefore, the appearance and interior design of cars have an important impact on consumers&#39; purchasing decisions. Chinese consumers often like to use the word &quot;daqi&quot; when evaluating cars, so that foreign car designers all know the word &quot;daqi&quot;. Without translation, they can understand a series of connotations it represents: majestic, huge, solemn, Have a face. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When consumers like it, manufacturers will naturally make the interior and exterior of the car more luxurious. At the same time, the current development of information technology has indeed continuously improved the information technology content of cars. Automobile manufacturers are also constantly introducing various innovative design elements to meet consumers&#39; needs for freshness and personalization. This kind of innovation even reaches the level of innovation for the sake of innovation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this context, consumers are often confused by the gorgeous appearance and advanced technology of the vehicle. They pay too much attention to the appearance, interior and intelligent systems of the car, and are attracted by the big sofa and big screen, but ignore it. The core values ​​of a car: performance in driving, safety and handling, which are directly related to consumers’ driving experience and driving safety. The total cost of a car is limited. If the cost is spent on visible places, you will naturally save money on invisible places. Since consumers don&#39;t pay attention to it, manufacturers will save money in this aspect and turn to making their cars more flashy, but in the end they will bury various hidden dangers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, when consumers buy a car, they should learn some professional knowledge and consider more comprehensively the weight between the car&#39;s functions, performance, appearance, and interior. They should not just focus on the appearance, interior, and intelligent systems. aspects and ignore the basic functions of the car. At the same time, automobile manufacturers also have the obligation to guide consumers correctly. While meeting consumer needs, we also guide consumers to choose a car that suits them more rationally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public opinion competition among manufacturers is an important way for consumers to become more professional. Competitors are all professionals and understand the unspoken rules and various shady secrets in the industry. Therefore, supervision from within the industry is often more targeted at the crux of the problem. This kind of industry supervision has spread from the technical level to the communication level, and the most important way to let consumers know is through advertising and marketing. Regardless of the rights and wrongs involved, discussing technical issues in public opinion is itself a process of popularizing science and a way to encourage consumers to learn professional knowledge and gradually distinguish the rights and wrongs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 01 Dec 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[假身份、假公章、假协议，吴秀波踩入了多深的坑？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261657]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-01 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Stills of &quot;The Great Military Advisor Sima Yi&quot;.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/96f07b79ac.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;691&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias /image/23/11/30/96f07b79ac.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260297&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stills from &quot;Army Division Sima Yi&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 24, 2023, the news that &quot;Wu Xiubo and his company were expropriated for 466 million yuan&quot; became a hot search topic, and actor Wu Xiubo, who had been out of the spotlight for three years, returned to the public eye again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Qichacha shows that Wu Xiubo and his 99%-owned Horgos Fuji Culture Media Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Fuji Company) have previously added a piece of information to be executed, and the execution target is 4.66 More than 100 million yuan, the execution party is the Higher People&#39;s Court of Jiangsu Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That night, Wu Xiubo posted two short videos on his personal Weibo, and the next day forwarded a long post on the official Weibo of the TV series &quot;Tiger Roars and Dragons Roar&quot;, detailing the TV series &quot;Army Master Sima Yi&quot; There were disputes during the production process, and it was said that &quot;two scammers with a lot of cases behind them used fake seals and contracts to set up a situation and caused bankruptcy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Xiubo, 55, was once a late bloomer in the film and television industry. He once said that he had done many businesses after graduating from the Central Academy of Drama, including opening karaoke bars, restaurants, and making film and television soundtracks. It wasn&#39;t until the TV series &quot;Before Dawn&quot; was aired in 2010 that Wu Xiubo got his first taste of popularity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Xiubo is obviously not satisfied with simply being an actor. After becoming famous, he frequently participated in the production and distribution of film and television dramas, and &quot;Army Master Sima Yi&quot; is one of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The drama is divided into two parts. The first part, &quot;Military Advisor Alliance&quot;, was broadcast on Jiangsu Satellite TV, Anhui Satellite TV, and Youku Video in June 2017, and achieved great success. With over 6 billion views and a Douban score of 8.2, it was one of the hottest dramas in 2017 and won the Feitian Award for Outstanding TV Drama that year. &quot;Tiger Roars and Dragon Roar&quot; is the second part. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, due to disputes over the distribution of interests, the three investors of the film launched a series of civil lawsuits against each other and were also involved in a criminal case. Another listed company suffered a decline in performance and was eventually delisted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What kind of &quot;confusion&quot; is behind the popular TV series? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Key people hold decision-making positions in three companies&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In October 2017, the popularity of the first part of &quot;Army Master Sima Yi&quot; has not subsided. The investor of the film, Jiangsu Huali Culture Media Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Huali Company) took another investor Dongyang Mengjiangwei Film and Television Culture Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Mengjiangwei Company) to court on the grounds that it failed to distribute income as agreed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The case was heard in public at the Hanjiang People’s Court of Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province on June 11, 2018, and the employer-employee dispute has since surfaced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fuer Company once stated in a statement that in 2013, company shareholder Wu Xiubo suggested the &quot;Sima Yi&quot; theme to Zhang Jian, then deputy general manager of Huali Company, and introduced Mengjiangwei Company Participate in project investment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That year, Wu Xiubo was filming &quot;Ma Xiangyang Goes to the Countryside&quot; directed by Zhang Yongxin. Zhang Yongxin once recalled in an exclusive interview that at that time Wu Xiubo was trying to find a director for the Sima Yi-themed TV series he was planning to shoot. The two were both history buffs. Their similar historical outlook and aesthetic taste made Wu Xiubo throw an &quot;hydrangea ball&quot; to Zhang Yongxin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the referee document, on July 27, 2014, Huali Company and Zhang Yongxin signed a director employment contract, Huali Company affixed the company’s administrative seal, and Zhang Jian signed as the company representative. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nearly 20 days ago, Huali Company also signed the well-known screenwriter Zheng Wanlong to write the script of &quot;Army Master Sima Yi&quot;. The latter has participated in the scriptwriting of &quot;Iron Teeth and Bronze Teeth Ji Xiaolan&quot; and other dramas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huali Company is a newbie in the film and television industry, and the boss behind it is mainly engaged in real estate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qichacha shows that Jin Hongxing, the actual controller of Huali Company, holds 42.38% of the shares of Jiangsu Huali Real Estate Group Co., Ltd. and once served as the latter’s executive director and general manager. The group was established in 2000 and is a long-established real estate company in Yangzhou. It has many projects in the local area and has won the title of &quot;Outstanding Real Estate Enterprise in Yangzhou City&quot; for five consecutive years from 2006 to 2010. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, another investor brought by Wu Xiubo, Mengjiangwei Company, has rich experience. The latter has participated in the production of popular dramas such as &quot;The New Four&quot; and &quot;Jingzhong Yue Fei&quot;. In April 2014, Mengjiangwei Company was acquired by the listed company Contemporary Oriental (delisted) for 1.1 billion yuan, a premium of 12 times. Contemporary Oriental made a fixed increase of 1.998 billion yuan for this purpose. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On December 14, 2015, Huali Company and Mengjiangwei Company signed a joint investment contract, which mainly agreed that the former would be the producer of the series, and the latter would be exclusively responsible for the global distribution of the series, with a total investment of 150 million. Yuan, each party invests 50%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next day, Huali Company signed an agreement with Fuji Company, entrusting the latter to film and produce the play. Huali Company was only responsible for investment, and both parties jointly appointed Zhang Jian as the producer of the play. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, Fuji Company was established less than three months ago. Wu Xiubo, the actual controller, held 99% of the shares, and Zhang Jian served as the legal representative of the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, Zhang Jian plays three roles in this drama project. He is the deputy general manager of the drama&#39;s management, the legal representative of the production company, and the producer of the film and television project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the increase in cast and crew remuneration, the budget of the play has increased to 220 million yuan. Huali Company and Mengjiangwei Company signed a supplementary agreement a month later, each investing a further 35 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2016, the filming of &quot;Sima Yi&quot;, which had been in preparation for nearly three years, finally started in Hengdian. During the period, the broadcast platforms Jiangsu Radio and Television and Youku were also locked in advance, and Mengjiangwei Company was responsible for distribution matters according to the agreement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mengjiangwei Company first sold the series to Jiangsu Radio and Television Group for a total price of 200.8 million yuan and broadcast it within the agreed period. Youku also later paid 108 million yuan to Mengjiangwei Company for the online issuance of &quot;Military Division Alliance&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of September 2017, more than two months after &quot;Military Alliance&quot; had finished airing, Huali Company sent a reminder letter to Mengjiangwei Company and its parent company, Contemporary Oriental, demanding proceeds from the issuance. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Forged official seal and mutual non-recognition agreement&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Mengjiangwei Company seems to be confused by Huali Company’s request. The former said that both parties and Fuji Company also signed a &quot;Supplementary Agreement&quot; II&quot; and &quot;Supplementary Agreement III&quot;, renegotiating the revenue sharing method. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the above two agreements, the budget of the film has been increased to 360 million yuan, and neither Huali Company nor Mengjiangwei Company will make additional investment. Huali Company discounted the cost of its script for 5% of the investment budget, and transferred the remaining 45% of the investment rights and corresponding rights to Fuji Company. At that time, Mengjiangwei Company had received an investment of 100.25 million yuan, so it also transferred the unpaid investment rights and corresponding rights and interests to Fuji Company. Jiangsu Radio and Television&#39;s distribution income goes to Mengjiangwei Company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Xiubo also expressed his approval of these two agreements. However, these agreements only bear the contract seals of the three companies. The column for Huali Company’s signature representative is blank. Zhang Jian signed the third supplementary agreement as a representative of Fuji Company. The signing date is only printed. &quot;2016&quot;, the specific month and day are also blank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fuer Company also provided a copy of the agreement between Huali Company and Horgos Premiere Times Film and Television Culture Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Premiere Times), stating that Huali Company will 5% of the investment share was sold to Premiere Times at a price of 20 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the above agreement, Huali Company will no longer have the investment rights and corresponding rights and interests in the film. However, Huali Company not only did not recognize the above-mentioned agreement, but also issued two contracts with contradictory contents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 5th and 6th, 2017, Horgos Huali Company, a subsidiary of Huali Company, and Fuji Company signed the &quot;Global Exclusive Agency Distribution Agreement for TV Series&quot; and &quot;TV Series Information Network Dissemination Agreement&quot; &quot;Agency Distribution Agreement&quot; mainly stipulates that all the distribution income of the drama series will go into the account of Fuji Company, and then be divided in half by Fuji Company and Huali Company. The distribution income of the co-investor Mengjiangwei Company will be handled by Fuji Company. Jin Hongxing represented Huali Company, and Zhang Jian signed the contract on behalf of Fuji Company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just a few days ago, on May 31, 2017, Fuji Company just signed a contract with Youku. The former granted the rights to network dissemination of the drama’s information and its sublicensing rights to the latter. The total price was tentatively determined. is 600 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Jin Hongxing also alleged that in the two supplementary agreements proposed by Mengjiangwei Company, the seals of Huali Company were forged by others, which involved another criminal case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One month after Huali Company sued Mengjiangwei Company, on November 8, 2017, the Yili Prefecture Public Security Bureau decided to investigate Zhang Jian on suspicion of official embezzlement and misappropriation of funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Jian stated in the interrogation transcript that his appointment as the legal representative of Fuji Company was approved by Jin Hongxing. The two supplementary agreements mentioned above and the agreement with Premiere Times contained the special contract seal of Huali Company. , also carved under the instruction of Jin Hongxing.

From 2014 to 2016, Mengjiangwei achieved net profits of 109 million yuan, 141 million yuan and 211 million yuan respectively. Mengjiangwei Company is undoubtedly the biggest performance supporter of Contemporary Oriental. As a reference, the net profit attributable to the parent company of Contemporary Oriental in the same period was 177 million yuan, 111 million yuan and -556,200 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After realizing the bet, Xu Jiaxuan left Contemporary Oriental on July 25, 2017, and the company’s performance immediately changed. Contemporary Oriental&#39;s net profit attributable to shareholders decreased by 38.20% year-on-year that year, and by 1559.79% year-on-year in 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Contemporary Oriental responded to inquiries from the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in 2019, stating that the departure of core team members led by Xu Jiaxuan had a certain impact on Mengjiangwei’s business, causing its revenue and profits to decline in 2017. On the other hand, affected by the negative public opinion of film and television actors, Mengjiangwei&#39;s performance in 2018 declined sharply and suffered losses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 4, 2022, Contemporary Oriental was delisted by the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and delisted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One month ago, Southern Capital liquidated its shares of Contemporary Oriental at a transfer price of 0.27 yuan/share, while the price when Wu Xiubo and others subscribed was 10.8 yuan/share. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The total clearance transfer price of Southern Capital is 25.3633 million yuan. Southern Capital also reduced its holdings of 7.9138 million shares at a price of 6.358 yuan per share in December 2019, cashing out 50.3159 million yuan. In total, Southern Capital recovered only 75.68 million yuan in Contemporary Oriental stocks, a loss of 86%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another listed company affected by &quot;Sima Yi&quot; is Great Wall Film and Television. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2016, Great Wall Film and Television issued a trading suspension announcement regarding the planning of a major asset restructuring, stating that it planned to acquire Beijing Premiere Times Culture Media Co., Ltd. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Great Wall Film and Television responded to inquiries from the Shenzhen Stock Exchange that year, it stated that Horgos Premiere Times, a subsidiary of the company it planned to acquire, had signed a contract to receive Huali Company’s 5% investment share in &quot;The Great Military Division Sima Yi&quot;.

Share according to the ratio of 60% and 40%. On May 6, the two parties signed a supplementary agreement to adjust the ratio to 70% and 30%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above announcement shows that the drama was broadcast in June 2017. Due to subsequent differences between the investors during the execution of the contract, due to the principle of caution during the premiere, no actual investment in the TV drama &quot; Military Advisor Alliance&quot; to confirm revenue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Great Wall Film and Television subsequently terminated its acquisition of Beijing Premiere Times. On May 7, 2021, Great Wall Film and Television was delisted and delisted by the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, Wu Xiubo is still the fourth largest circulating shareholder of the listed company Xingfu Blue Ocean (300528.SZ), holding 1.5% of the shares, with a reference market value of 62 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Happiness Blue Ocean is the first state-controlled listed company on the GEM that invests in the production of TV series and operates the entire film industry chain.

My reading is actually pronounced in Japanese, because they are almost my reading when I know the reading of &quot;Dunhuang&quot; and &quot;Kumorosh&quot; more than 20 years ago, so I was very impressed. This impression originated from a documentary produced by the Japanese NHK TV station I saw at the time: &quot;Silk Road&quot;. Ashamed, before that, I couldn&#39;t understand whether it was Dunhuang or Kumorosh. Later, I gradually learned that Dunhuang had an extraordinary position in the hearts of Japanese nationals. In October 2018, for the first time, I went to Dunhuang for the first time. After turning in Xi&#39;an, I found the same machine as a Japanese tour group, and the Tonkou screen in the memory flashed frame by frame. At that time, I secretly sighed: Japan&#39;s &quot;Dunhuang Fever&quot; really made a name. Speaking of the origin of Japan&#39;s &quot;Dunhuang Fei&quot;, this book published in 1943 is undoubtedly one of the initiatives. Because this book is a &quot;novel&quot;, in order to avoid spoilers, the content is not mentioned here.

What role did the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union play in this tragedy? This may be some issues that our readers will think of. The author of this book is a well -known expert in politics in Southeast Asian countries. Therefore, although this book is named &quot;history&quot;, it is not a general described, but has clear analysis characteristics. The author followed Indonesia&#39;s internal ideology, military and political relations, religious beliefs, and racial identity, which carefully portrayed the distribution map of the huge energy of the massacre. Of course, due to many complex and sensitive issues involving religious and racial relations, the author&#39;s writing is different, which can be described as cautious. It&#39;s completely crushed.

In this way, we understand that reading this book must cross the high threshold. However, because the author has a model that runs through the book, this makes the discussion of this book show rare and clear. This model is very concise: authenticity R (x, m, y) is a structure composed of subject X, control method M, and object Y. . So, isn&#39;t this the repetition of the basic methods of modern scientific research? This is not the case; the author realizes that the authenticity should be distinguished into three irregularities: science, individual and society, so it is necessary to establish a unified theory for this. In this book, the theoretical blind spots of the well -known Kun in the field of science and philosophy in the twentieth century, the &quot;Non -Talking Kingdom&quot; woven by the school&#39;s self -owned human intellectuals by the European and American schools &quot;Amazing&quot;, and even the most cutting -edge norms theory of the theory of theoretical physics, the author&#39;s attributes of the super string theory, etc., the author gives his very unique and bold view, which can be described as a great philosophical ambition. In the process of reading this book, I will from time to time to compare the experience I have obtained by my studies and research institutes from time to time. Although there are differences in the results, I have made me contemplative.

Mathematics teachers read this book? After many years of reading, the original Chinese works that are full of vitality can be described as extremely rare. Reading is refreshing, which makes me emotion from time to time: Mr. Qiu is really a gentleman, and it is really the world. This vigorously manifests both the bravery and progressiveness of his mathematical research, but also in his low criticism of his low academic style of fame and fortune, but also in his enthusiasm for cultivating students. Psychological mechanism: &quot;On the occasion of heaven and people, the changes of ancient and modern times have become the words of the family.&quot; This is the famous saying of Tai Shigong. I don&#39;t know how many scholars have cheered up. I have seen criticism on him on the Internet. The idea is to say that Qiu Chengtong is overbearing the clouds; some details of the story can refer to &quot;My Earthly Life: Qiu Chengtong&#39;s Autobiography&quot;. At that time, I thought: Well, the critics will take a little bit at the above four o&#39;clock, and I will serve it; otherwise, please listen to the training of Mr..

His economic perspective gave him a consciousness of seeing &quot;conquest and culture&quot; from the perspective of human nature history. For example, the situation of black people in the American plantation in the 19th century is better than the plantations in the Latin American region. Irish immigrants do some dangerous work. So, how do the author think of &quot;colonial conquest&quot;? The current violent conflict of the world can be said to be the continuation of this helpless human nature history. The pace of progress of human civilization seems to be slower and heavy today. Because of his special ethnic identity, the author of this book has a relatively gentle and tolerant reproduction of this period of history, and his calm criticism of &quot;tribalism&quot;, making his expression and ideas more meaningful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;br>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>; • &lt;/span>; &lt;span style = &quot;fontt -Family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, Stkaiti; FONT-weight: Bold; &quot;>; (Author is Associate Professor of the Department of Political Science of East China Normal University) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;br>; &lt;/p>; &lt;br>; &lt;br>; >; &lt;hr>; &lt;div>; Get more RSS: &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:oraange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>; https://feedx.net &lt;/ a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:urange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>; https://feedx.run &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[作为文本的茶馆丨记者手记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258517]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/27/k7XSaOnKmcU72AMhUa66c91RrEJSV10jWfkJLuh9.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/k7XSaOnKmcU72AMhUa66c91RrEJSV 10jWfkJLuh9. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252385&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wang Di at Heming Tea House in Chengdu People&#39;s Park&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa ;&quot;>;(Hua Xiaofeng/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For relevant reports, please see &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https:// www.infzm.com/contents/257991&quot; title=&quot;Wang Di: Historian in the Teahouse&quot;>;Wang Di: Historian in the Teahouse&lt;/a>;》&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Di’s generation in Chengdu When people meet, they like to say, &quot;I eat three flowers in my mouth.&quot; &quot;Kouzi&quot; means &quot;Jiekou&quot;. &quot;啖&quot; means &quot;to eat&quot;. Su Dongpo&#39;s famous sentence &quot;Eating three hundred lychees a day&quot; will be pronounced more accurately in Sichuan dialect. This is easy to understand. The term &quot;Three Flowers&quot; requires experienced Chengdu people to explain it in detail before they can understand it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I first met Wang Di, I proposed to sit in a teahouse. Wang Di said, let’s meet at Heming Teahouse in People’s Park. At Heming Teahouse, as soon as we sat down, Wang Di explained what &quot;three flowers&quot; were. &quot;When I was a child, I drank third-grade flower tea, which is the most popular tea. I went to the United States in 1991, and when I returned to Chengdu in 1997, I went to a teahouse to drink tea. The tea waiter asked, what kind of tea should I drink? I said, &#39;Sanhua&#39; &#39;. He said that the worst ones now are &#39;special flower&#39; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 混体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Special Flower Tea&lt;/span>;).&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;From &quot;three flowers&quot; to &quot;special flowers&quot;, it seems to conform to a certain &quot;law&quot; of &quot;rising&quot; along time. Wang Di said that maybe the &quot;Special Flower&quot; now is the &quot;Sanhua&quot; back then, but the name has just been changed. Older Chengdu people say &quot;eat tea with your mouth in mind&quot;. At that time, there was not even the word &quot;三花&quot;. An author signed by &quot;Follower&quot; made a somewhat pessimistic prediction in a Chengdu newspaper in 1942: &quot;As long as society progresses and a replacement for the teahouse appears, it will definitely decline or even cease to exist.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;Wang Di wrote at the end of &quot;Teahouse: Public Life and Microcosm in Chengdu, 1900-1950&quot;: &quot;A few hours later, they will still open the door of the teahouse just like they did on the first day of the century fifty years ago. They were unloaded piece by piece, but they didn’t know that together with this city, they had entered a completely different era that, although vigorous, no longer belonged to teahouses and tea guests.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to write this Teahouses in different eras, thus &quot;Teahouse: The Decline and Renaissance of Public Life in Chengdu, 1950-2000&quot;. Wang Di was born in 1956 and has more personal experience of Chengdu teahouses during this period. These two books constitute a century-old history of teahouses in Chengdu. &quot;Although the theme of this century-old history is teahouses, it is also a century-old economic history, a century-old social history, a century-old cultural history, a century-old popular history, a century-old history of daily life, and even a century-old Chinese city&#39;s history seen from the microcosm of the teahouse. The history of character.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Di&#39;s years of writing about teahouses earned him the second biennial (2018-2019) &quot;Best Book Award&quot; from the American Urban History Society. The award citation said: &quot;This book adopts a multi-disciplinary research orientation, adopts anthropological and sociological research methods and theories, and mines various historical documents, including newspapers, diaries, personal records, and oral data of teahouse culture, so that This research is very in-depth.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For media professionals, Wang Di’s works have a lot to learn from. How to think big from the micro? How to see the times from ordinary people? How to find new ideas from numerous materials? These are common problems we face. Wang Di took me to many places. The feeling of telling history on the spot is extraordinary. It allows people to see three-dimensional and rich details, and naturally compare teahouses and tea guests in time and space. Everything is emotional. The collision and fusion of opinions and rational thoughts will form complex and fresh texts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Texts, or &quot;fragments,&quot; written by specific individuals provide new perspectives on history. Everyone adds their own text to history itself, so that history will be richer and more visible, and it will continue to get closer to the &quot;reality&quot; itself. There is no overall history, only ever-expanding history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[短剧制造者：哪有什么一夜暴富？不过是流量的打工仔]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261641]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The shooting scene in Xuanpingli, Dahan, Xi&#39;an.

Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Luo Huanhuan&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Short plays are popular, but what are short plays? There are many descriptions in the industry: &quot;small local drama&quot;, &quot;mini program short drama&quot;, &quot;vertical screen drama&quot;, &quot;paid short drama&quot;, &quot;one-minute short drama&quot;... These words are put together to form the legendary &quot;short drama&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a video-based novel. You have to jump to WeChat, Douyin, and Kuaishou mini programs to watch it. The first few episodes are free, and then one yuan per episode, one minute per episode, and one episode is about 100 episodes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After all, it is more expensive than watching a movie, and the box office is about the same as a movie. Industry insiders have speculated based on internal data released by Douyin that annual sales can exceed 30 billion. By comparison, the national movie box office in 2022 will only be 30.067 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past month, this kind of imagination has made capital excited, and stocks related to short dramas have experienced skyrocketing prices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of November 22, 2023, Tianwei Video and Chinese Online have both increased by more than 140% within the month, and Gravity Media, Guangbo Shares, Jiayun Technology, etc. have increased by more than 60%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The unfinished story of capital is that this business looks very &quot;rich&quot;, but in fact it is difficult to make money. Many industry insiders told Southern Weekend reporters that the profit rate will not exceed 10%. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;90% of the income is used to pay for advertising on Douyin, Kuaishou, and WeChat. They are the driving forces behind the short drama’s popularity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person in charge of a short drama platform told a Southern Weekend reporter that the life of short dramas is given by traffic. It can make you rich overnight, or it can make you lose money overnight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said, just like e-commerce and merchants, &quot;If we don&#39;t support you to go online, your goods will sell hundreds of thousands a month, but if we support you, it will be tens of millions.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An industry insider explained that according to Douyin’s traffic bidding mechanism, the cost of acquiring customers for short dramas is actually the result of competition with e-commerce, live streaming, games and other industries. Short dramas can acquire customers at a lower cost. Guest, this is the fundamental reason for its rise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the ability of other industries to pay for traffic is weakening, and their ability to pay for traffic affects the future of short dramas. &quot;If live broadcasts become popular again next year, or those live broadcast rewards are at the top of the list, If guys are willing to pay for gifts again, they will steal more traffic with higher bids, and this will truly end the future of short dramas.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Right now, the leaders in the industry are deploying their own apps in order to seize this period of time and keep users on their own platforms, thereby getting rid of dependence on traffic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In late November, the wild growth of short dramas ushered in a new round of supervision, and the State Administration of Radio and Television once again launched a one-month special rectification work on online micro-short dramas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Major short video platforms have removed a large number of illegal micro-short dramas from the shelves and banned a large number of accounts that have illegally published micro-short dramas. The micro-short drama &quot;Black Lotus&#39; Handbook for Ascension&quot; produced by Mi Meng&#39;s team was removed from the shelves for &quot;exaggerating the bad values ​​of extreme revenge and using violence to counter violence.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A short drama platform founder told Southern Weekend reporters that supervision had begun as early as November last year, and starting from March 2023, the platform will also require &quot;review before broadcasting.&quot; In the past year, &quot;Every episode will be reviewed. After review, you will be given clear instructions whether you have passed the review or not, such as too many intimate scenes, etc.&quot; The founder has also had one or two dramas abandoned due to too many revisions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since a large number of companies in the industry have transformed from online novel platforms, most companies are equipped with &quot;self-reviewers&quot;. &quot;Overall, it does not have a big impact on us.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his view, supervision is a good thing. Now everyone is waiting for the &quot;Detailed Rules for the Creation, Production and Content Review of Online Micro-Short Dramas&quot; formulated by the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television. With it, the waste of investment caused by failure to review will be reduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The State Administration of Radio, Film and Television has launched a special rectification work on online micro-short dramas since late November 2022, and has removed from the shelves more than 25,000 short dramas, totaling 1.36 million episodes, and &quot;small-format dramas&quot; that contain illegal content. Programs&quot; 2420. From March 2023 to the present, more than 350,000 episodes (strips) of vulgar and harmful online mini-drama have been cleared, and 429 related &quot;mini programs&quot; and 2,988 accounts have been dealt with at different levels. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Xi&#39;an has become a center for short dramas&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Sorry, my voice is hoarse.&quot; Li Tao has to meet more than a dozen people every day, &quot;Chen Ou flew to Xi&#39;an yesterday, just to gather beautiful and beautiful people. As for Chen Ou, some state-backed companies also came to me to see if there was any possibility of cooperation.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Tao is the founder of Fengxing Studio, which was originally a little-known film and television company. Previously, it mainly produced information flow advertisements and occasionally hosted weddings. I just started filming short plays last year when I couldn&#39;t get any work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Douyin releases an advertising consumption list every week. Being on the list is considered a hit. In the past year, Li Tao filmed 14 short dramas, 9 of which were on the list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Especially &quot;Wushuang&quot;, which was online for 24 hours, had a top-up of more than 50 million, and consumed 100 million ads in 8 days. It became this year&#39;s &quot;King of Dramas&quot; and Feng Xing became a &quot;hot star&quot; in the industry overnight. Fried chicken&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Li Tao was doing information flow advertising before, Xi&#39;an gathered more than half of the country&#39;s information flow advertising shooting team. After the short drama became popular, Xi&#39;an also transformed from an information flow advertising production base to a short drama center. Li Tao said, &quot;Sometimes, nine out of ten hits on the list come from Xi&#39;an.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Tao moved his office to Xi&#39;an Silk Road Center at the beginning of this year. There is a floor-to-ceiling window with a 270° panoramic view, overlooking the entire Chanba Ecological Zone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He regards this place as his blessed place. &quot;After moving here, the drama started to explode.&quot; More and more people came to him. He added a large coffee table, prepared a complete set of tea sets, and learned Acting like a southern businessman, he made Kung Fu tea for the guests. &quot; I want to feel happy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What people who come to drink tea are most concerned about is whether there is a password for the popular product? Li Tao&#39;s answer is &quot;book&quot;. A good script plus good production equals a big hit. A good script plus poor production equals a small hit. A bad script plus good production may not necessarily lead to a hit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Someone re-filmed &quot;Wushuang&quot;, &quot;I just changed the character names, even the actors&#39; sentences were the same, and the result was still a hit, which shows that the script is really good,&quot; Li Tao said . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He can read dozens of scripts a week and has developed a skill. &quot;After watching the first episode, I can guess the content of the next dozen episodes.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For these production teams, only by making hits can they have the opportunity to select good scripts. Only by selecting good scripts can they have the opportunity to make more hits. In order to get a good script, they are even willing to advance funding for filming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But what kind of book will explode? &quot;This is a metaphysics.&quot; Li Tao is more confident about how to present a good script. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first time I found the feeling of filming a short play was during the Spring Festival this year. At 3 a.m. on the sixth day of the lunar month, he checked the surveillance on his mobile phone and found that two shareholders were working overtime in the office to edit a film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fengxing has six shareholders, all of whom have been friends for more than ten years. Li Tao felt uncomfortable, &quot;My brothers are working overtime, and I am celebrating the New Year at home. This is not going to work. I called the others and said, Let’s go to the company and work overtime together.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At around four in the morning, six people were editing a film in the company. The first episode was cut out to 3 minutes, but the pace was not fast enough and the impact was not strong enough. Everyone started arguing while talking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One side believed that the story should be complete and the main line should be clearly explained. The other side believed that the pace should be fast and the impact should be strong. No one could convince anyone. The final decision was that &quot;one person would cut one version and compare it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After comparing the two versions, the controversy disappeared. &quot;The audience will definitely know what this is about through two short sentences.&quot; Li Tao explained to Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;The core of the short play is The rhythm, if it is very long, it will be over if you feel relaxed.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Short dramas need to subvert many concepts in the past. The experience of the traditional film and television industry has become a burden for short dramas. Now, compared to mature actors in the traditional sense, Li Tao prefers actors with experience in short plays. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Xi&#39;an has become a center for short dramas.

Photographed by Southern Weekend reporter Luo Huanhuan&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Between being happy and not happy&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Wu Shuang&quot; tells the story of the male protagonist Chu Qing who helps his wife make a comeback. After the wife becomes famous, she dislikes her husband and wants to divorce. But she didn&#39;t know that Chu Qing&#39;s other identity was the supreme master of the Dragon Palace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This drama has never explained what the Dragon Palace is, why it has supreme power, why Chu Qing needs to conceal his identity, he has to prove his identity, why can&#39;t he just say it...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Li Tao’s experience is that there is no need to pursue logic and rationality. “Many themes are fictitious. You don’t need to worry about which dynasty it is, or trace whether it is from the Song Dynasty or the Tang Dynasty. It is just a costume drama, the Three Palaces and Six Dynasties.” The courtyard is a matter between the emperor and his concubines.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key to the short drama is to control the audience&#39;s emotions and keep them in a state of &quot;between being happy and not yet happy&quot;. A small hook must be left at the end of each episode to make everyone want to read on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first and paid episodes are the key to a short drama. Li Tao&#39;s experience is that people must be retained in the first episode, and paid episodes are usually set before the biggest suspense is solved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On average, editors at Fengxing Studio edit 1.6 episodes of short dramas a day, including the first episode and paid episodes, which usually take 5 to 15 days. Editor Er Pang told Southern Weekend reporters that their requirement is that &quot;every frame must be meaningful&quot; and there is no way to add water to a short drama. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Tao described that a good screenwriter can stabilize the audience&#39;s emotions, set a hook every time, and untie the hook reasonably, so that the suspense is still there and the audience will not lose patience. For example, the male protagonist has been suppressed for two episodes, and his emotions are almost suppressed. A small reversal is interspersed to stabilize the audience&#39;s emotions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of high-reversal, high-frequency, fast-paced plot is designed to stop the brain from thinking. &quot;As soon as you think about it, I fail,&quot; a short drama producer told a Southern Weekend reporter , &quot;When you think about it later, you will wonder whether the money was worth it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Tao introduced, &quot;We meet the needs of users in minutes,&quot; which is faster and more exciting. It is denser, has more reversals and fuller emotions. He believes that short plays have created an unprecedented form of film and television. &quot;I have never seen anything so dramatic in the history of film. No matter how good the film is, it cannot be cut into one minute.&quot; Sell ​​by the minute.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the professional shooting team in Hengdian, these &quot;people on the margins of the film and television industry&quot; in Xi&#39;an have an advantage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They once visited Hengdian for inspection and found that they still use traditional film and television techniques to shoot short dramas. The sound and pictures are recorded separately, the picture quality is 4K, and large machines are used to shoot on site. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The production team in Xi&#39;an can sometimes shoot a 100-minute drama in four days. In order to improve efficiency, the picture and sound are recorded at the same time. The picture quality is 2K. All shooting machines are handheld and no large machines are used. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some traditional film and television people will also come to Li Tao to communicate. He obviously feels that, &quot;From the other side&#39;s heart, they don&#39;t like short dramas, and they feel that they are doing big dramas. But this does not exist Many big teams looked down on dimensionality reduction at first, but then they wanted to do it but found that they couldn&#39;t do it. This is a very common phenomenon in short dramas.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In less than a year, this office that brought good luck to Li Tao was already overcrowded. On the day of the interview with Southern Weekend reporters, Li Tao had just found a new office, &quot;more than a thousand square meters.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“The protagonist is either a security guard or a delivery person”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When Wang Xiaoshu started filming short plays in 2021, no one was optimistic about the short plays. “The first batch of people who filmed short plays , taking me as an example, they may all be losers.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2020, he founded Jia Shu Technology, a free novel platform. &quot;The business will not close, but it is not very good either.&quot; Seeing the story experts on Kuaishou, he felt that it was very similar to online novels. &quot;If we produce novels such as Son-in-law and God of War, which we are good at, there should be a market.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2021, he filmed his first short drama &quot;The Strongest Female Security Guard&quot;. He didn&#39;t use a film camera, just a camera. &quot;It&#39;s a bit too much to call it a drama. You can&#39;t imagine how crude it is.&quot; The budget was 30,000 yuan to shoot for 100 minutes. &quot;I didn&#39;t even accept weddings, saying it was too cheap.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He remembered that, including Jia Shu Technology, there were maybe four short drama companies at that time. &quot;The protagonist of the short play is either a security guard or a food delivery guy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He found a Kuaishou expert in Tongnan, Chongqing. &quot;In Tongnan, one led one by one, and there were several teams specializing in photographing security guards. Their names were all very crude, and they were called &#39;shooting jokes&#39;.&quot; &#39;&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to film a story, Wang Xiaoshu flew from Shanghai to Chongqing Jiangbei Airport, then took a three-hour bus ride, and finally met his heroine in a remote town - a story with millions of fans. Blog. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This business is also very magical to me, and I don’t know how to shoot it.” Wang Xiaoshu asked the expert to shoot the popular content on Kuaishou again. “At that time, I can’t say that I was polishing it. , I can only say that in order to extend the time, enrich the dialogue, and add a bit of conflict.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The purpose is to leave space for recharging. &quot;Users have to watch about 10 minutes before paying, and the whole show is only 30 minutes. It feels bad to pay. For fifty, sixty, seventy or eighty episodes, users The recharge space will be larger.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everything is very primitive, there are no actors, &quot;her grandfather, grandmother, and cousin came to help&quot;, and the venue did not cost any money, &quot;just in front of a factory that has stopped production.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was very hot in Chongqing in July, so I had to take a break after taking a photo. Wang Xiaoshu squatted in front of the factory with an umbrella and finished the photoshoot in four days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The other party also suspected that he was a liar and asked him to pay the money in one lump sum. The reason was: &quot;A similar story has been published on Kuaishou. If you shoot it again, will anyone see it?&quot;&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;Wang Xiaoshu actually had no idea, &quot;it was too shoddy&quot;, but he soon discovered that he was wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Middle-aged and elderly people love to watch it&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;He bought 100,000 yuan of traffic for &quot;The Strongest Female Security Guard&quot; on the WeChat public account, and then played it on the mini program after on-demand viewing. The reason why we choose mini programs is that it is much easier than promoting apps. After all, the cost for users to download and install is very high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The platform charges a channel fee from the recharge he withdraws. The channel fee for the WeChat mini program has risen to 5-8 yuan per 100 yuan, while Douyin only costs 1-2 yuan, but WeChat is still the big one. &quot;Short drama&quot; The audience is more accustomed to using WeChat to pay, and Douyin needs to be redirected, which will create an additional payment obstacle.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;&quot;The Strongest Female Security Guard&quot; has returned about 100,000 in almost 20 days,&quot; which gave Wang Xiaoshu a premonition that this model could work. &quot;There are still people watching this crude production, so let&#39;s make it better. You can get your money back.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The short dramas that became popular at first were all security dramas, and their audience was also summarized as the &quot;three guarantees&quot; personnel, &quot;security guards, cleaners, and nannies.&quot; However, Wang Xiaoshu discovered through the backstage that these people were not necessarily low-income groups. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After accumulating tens of millions of fans, Wang Xiaoshu made user portraits and found that half of them were over 45 years old. “Most people may think that when people get older, they stop reading. We found that when people get older, It’s very impressive to see.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After starting his business for more than four years, Wang Xiaoshu interacts with this group of people every day. He feels that the entertainment life of middle-aged and elderly people is very lacking. &quot;Young people have many activities and do not need to consume online. These dramas are not cheap. An episode costs about 60 cents, and 100 minutes costs 60 yuan. Middle-aged and elderly people have both money and leisure.&quot; Moreover, young people are very familiar with the Internet. &quot;You can find pirated copies if you search casually, and it is difficult to pay for short dramas.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The entry threshold for short plays is also very low. &quot;No need to think, no need to read, no need to think, everything is placed in front of you.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It completely follows the classification system of online articles, which is divided into male channels and female channels according to the gender of the audience. The consumption psychology of the two groups is also different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Female video drama consumers are all grandmothers or mothers, and the most popular themes are sadomasochism and sweet pets. Wang Xiaoshu felt that they were &quot;still very eager and longing for love.&quot; Their marriage may have been like this. They had never been in love when they were young, and they longed to be cared for. &quot;It should be said that people need to be loved throughout their lives.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More men watch short dramas than women, and the male dramas dominate. God of War is the most popular theme, followed by son-in-law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The self-media &quot;Short Drama Study Room&quot; found based on the statistics of the streaming list released by Douyin that among the popular short dramas from January to July 2023, the theme of God of War accounted for 32.98%, ranking second. It is a female video drama with a sadomasochistic theme, accounting for only 9.42%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called &quot;God of War&quot; refers to a person with a powerful identity who hides his identity and transforms into a small person. He is bullied by the villain and finally reveals his identity to fight back against the opponent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Xiaoshu said that security guards or couriers will make the audience feel more involved. &quot;In reality, these groups are not respected, but in dreams they are very powerful and have status.&quot; It empathizes with the suppression and is released from the protagonist&#39;s counterattack. &quot;Dignity is something that many men lack on a daily basis.&quot; Wang Xiaoshu believes that short dramas can satisfy them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Short plays are used to create dreams. What does a dream look like? The dream is when he threatens you with &#39;bad reviews&#39;, and you suddenly laugh and say, &#39;Actually, I am a rich second generation, I will Being a delivery boy is just about experiencing life, but has it suddenly changed?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Wushuang&quot; combines the elements of God of War and son-in-law. &quot;The male protagonist conceals his identity and becomes the son-in-law, not because he is not strong enough. It&#39;s because I like that woman, and her strong identity will always be made public.&quot; Li Tao feels, &quot;People who are suppressed by their wives or mother-in-law in life can be greatly released here.&quot; &lt;p>; com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/e2488df4d8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;2337&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/11/30/e2488df4d8.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260288&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Wushuang&quot;, online for 24 hours recharge With over 50 million, he became this year’s “King of Dramas”. Picture source: Video screenshot&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Unexpectedly small profits&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After March 2022, Wang Xiaoshu suddenly discovered that the entire industry began to skyrocket. “In two or three months, the company’s revenue scale went from several to One million suddenly increased to tens of millions.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Douyin and WeChat became interoperable at the end of 2021, and short dramas became the beneficiaries. Wang Xiaoshu said that in the past, when buying traffic from official accounts, 40% might be recovered on the first day. After Douyin allowed jumping to the WeChat mini program, “the recovery on the same day was 100%.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Douyin also invited short drama platforms to stream in March 2022 (that is, merchants pay to increase traffic), which brought a huge turnaround to the industry. At its peak, Douyin’s short dramas invested in Stream consumption is 80 million a day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Xiaoshu believes that the first year of short dramas is 2021. In June of that year, the WeChat ecosystem opened up short dramas for streaming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, there had been a large number of micro-short plays before that. For example, Tencent Video’s “Please! &quot;Don&#39;t Spoil Me&quot;, the amount of the split account in the third season reached 32.49 million yuan, and it is known as the &quot;King of Drama&quot; in the split account short drama. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But these short plays are not paid short plays. Their commercial realization relies on platform subsidies, and the bulk of the investment is still production fees. &quot;please! The production cost of &quot;Don&#39;t Spoil Me&quot; is as high as 20 million, and the advertising cost is only a few million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Essentially, these short dramas still follow the business model of long videos. The broadcast platform splits the bill with the producer based on the click rate of 1,000 people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The paid short drama adopts the business model of online novels. The monetization path is for users to pay for on-demand viewing, but more than 90% of the income must be used to pay advertising fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This business model is completely rooted in the CPS model of online novels, that is, the copyright owner opens the promotion link to distributors, and the distributors create secondary creations of the materials and publish them through Douyin, Kuaishou, and WeChat official accounts. Attract users to recharge, and both parties will split accounts according to the recharge amount. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the top short drama companies have been in the novel business before, such as Chinese Online, Dianzhong, Peanuts, etc., all have their own online distribution systems. They are the core of the industry, the copyright holders, and hold the most important resource - the script. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Its upstream is connected to producers such as Fengxing Studio. The copyright owner will give the other party some guaranteed fees. The part of the shooting cost that exceeds the guarantee must be borne by the producer himself, and the profit will be divided in the end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Its downstream is the distribution distributor. The copyright owner provides technology and content and takes 15% from the recharge. There are also short drama companies that do their own distribution. Jiuzhou Culture is a company that is famous for its castings, with a casting team of 300 people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Distribution is the lowest level of the short drama industry, and it is also the most mysterious and low-key group of people. Mou Changqing is very familiar with several leading short drama platforms. He is the founder of the short drama community &quot;28 Push&quot;. The main members of this community are the platforms, distributors and producers of short dramas. , script side. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;Most of the well-established distributors keep a low profile and never show off their cakes because they are afraid of being poached.&quot; When he saw some media reports claiming that the short play was created by a team of e-commerce brushing orders, he believed this was inconsistent with the facts. “The mainstream short drama platforms I know of include their main distributors, and none of them used to do e-commerce brushing orders. of&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Distribution is a resource-hungry industry. &quot;Most of the good distribution is due to a good relationship with the platform.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rate of return on traffic refers to the money that users recharge after buying traffic. Mou Changqing said, &quot;If the information provider invests in streaming, if it is a private e-commerce company, it would be good if it can repay 60% to 80% of the cost on the same day, because the private sector relies on follow-up to slowly repay the cost. If the live broadcast does not repay the cost on the same day, it will lose money. &quot;The return on investment must reach 150% to make money. In comparison, short dramas can reach 130% if done well.&quot; Mou Changqing said that short dramas are also one of the few projects that can return the money on the same day. Many powerful distribution companies They all chose to do short plays, &quot;thinking they can grab this piece of cake.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yan Min, the founder of &quot;Short Drama Expert&quot;, has also done short drama distribution business. He and Mou Changqing have different views. He told Southern Weekend reporters that the return rate of a short drama must reach 120%. It&#39;s not easy. &quot;A drama that can achieve such a rate of return can be regarded as a &#39;magic drama&#39;.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is actually very difficult to make money from short drama streaming. Yan Min said, &quot;As long as the return rate exceeds 105%, I will continue to invest. 100 yuan of advertising, 105 yuan of recharge, and 5 yuan paid to Tencent , labor is actually a loss.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He explained that the core of investment is to start with volume. If you recharge 100 million yuan, the profit rate is only 1%, and you can still make 1 million yuan. There is no minimum amount. After recharging 100,000 yuan, the profit margin is 10%, and the profit is only 10,000 yuan, which is still a loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Douyin’s streaming system can set the rate of return. For example, if you invest 100,000 first, the return rate will be 110%. Only if the user recharges 110,000 will the next round of investment be triggered. Distributors will expand their scale as much as possible without losing money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yan Min said that distribution is an industry with high labor costs and thin profit margins. “For a small team of fifty or sixty pitchers, no one will care about you at all. If you have more than 200 pitchers, profitable&quot;. In the entire industry chain, distributors have the lowest threshold and the thinnest profits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Content is king in short plays, and the copyright owner has the highest threshold, and they are the main ones who can make money. They can only provide technology and content and let distributors bear the cost of distribution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The producers also bear risks. Wang Xiaoshu said, &quot;To shoot 30 dramas a month, the content cost is 10 million. If the box office is not 100 million, wouldn&#39;t it be a loss? This does not include the platform&#39;s own manpower expenses and other expenses, but only the content cost. Most platforms still lose money. &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The real winner is only the traffic side&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Short dramas are already a red ocean. Wang Xiaoshu calculated an account. According to the daily consumption calculations previously announced by Douyin, the monthly short drama sales It’s about 2 billion, corresponding to about 700 new dramas. The production cost of a drama is about 300,000 yuan, and the average revenue per unit is 3 million yuan, which means it is just profitable. In fact, the hits took most of the share, and most of the short plays were less than 3 million, which means they lost money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mou Changqing said, &quot;Many media think that if you recharge 30 million, you can earn 30 million. If the return rate is set to 110%, the gross profit will be only 3 million.&quot; After deducting various costs, The profit is only 1 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yan Min believes that &quot;those people deliberately make it so easy, just to cut leeks and let others invest.&quot; Some bosses in traditional industries mistakenly believe that investing hundreds of thousands can generate tens of millions in income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The real winner in the short drama industry is only the traffic side. Most of the revenue goes to Douyin, Kuaishou, and WeChat, leaving only about 10% of the industry’s profits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Producers generally need to pay for filming. &quot;I have paid a little too hard recently, and now I am a little scared.&quot; Li Qiang, the boss of Xi&#39;an Gewu Qianfan, told Southern Weekend reporters that he has already paid for a movie. The skit has more than 1 million posts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the guaranteed production fee given by the copyright owner, the purpose of their payment is to improve the quality. &quot;It makes no sense for me to earn your 108,000 or 80,000 yuan production fee. What I want is to split the account,&quot; he asked. Southern Weekend reporter, &quot;50,000 or 5 million, which one do you want?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He has been in the short drama circle for less than half a year. This is the first short drama he has invested in. &quot;I see this. &quot;Definitely win&quot;, if you can&#39;t win, it&#39;s just paying for your hobby. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the contrary, Li Tao is more cautious than the newcomers, &quot;I am not willing to shoot a short drama with a production cost of more than 600,000 to 700,000 yuan.&quot; He made some calculations, &quot;If you shoot a drama with more than 300,000 yuan, you can make a profit by recharging it to 3 million. For 600,000, you need to recharge 7 to 8 million to make a profit. How many dramas can have a recharge of tens of millions?&quot; What?&quot; He hopes to make some more stable money, &quot;I can make 200,000 yuan per movie, and I can do 50 movies a year, and I will still make a good profit.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Nan, the boss of Xi’an Muniu Liuma Film and Television, has released three hit movies. “Not even the third one on the list, but the first and second ones.” However, he told Southern Weekend reporters that he is in a difficult situation now. The capital chain is broken, &quot;I don&#39;t know if I can survive until next month.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the film or online drama industry, teams are often formed temporarily, but short drama production companies need assembly line production. Chen Nan has four shooting teams with more than 40 people. Not counting rent, &quot;each The monthly salary is two to three hundred thousand.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Tao said frankly, &quot;I can responsibly say that less than 10% of people in this industry can actually make money, and 90% are losing money.&quot; He used himself as an example. They filmed nine After a short play, the first hit came out, &quot;But everyone only saw &#39;wolf eating meat&#39;, not &#39;wolf being beaten&#39;.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2023, Chen Ou announced that he was actively watching short dramas. A month later, he told Southern Weekend reporters that he was &quot;still in the learning and research stage.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 26, the famous Hong Kong director Wang Jing appeared at the opening ceremony of a short drama. This may be the first opening ceremony held by the short drama industry. You know, vertical screen short dramas Cast and crew names never appear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[监察官等级首次确定工作全面完成]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261626]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;As of mid-November, 31 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) across the country and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps City For the first time, the work of determining the grade of county-level supervisors has been completed. This marks the successful conclusion of the first determination of the national supervisory officer level, which will be carried out since 2022. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Doing a good job in determining the level of supervisors is an important measure to deepen the reform of the national supervision system. It is a practical need to build a high-quality professional discipline inspection and supervision iron army. It is also important for building supervision with Chinese characteristics. It is of great significance to strengthen the official system, uphold and improve the party and state supervision system, and promote the high-quality development of disciplinary inspection and supervision work. Under the unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Supervisory Commission took the lead in carrying out the work from top to bottom and level by level. Local party committees, disciplinary inspection commissions and supervisory commissions resolutely shouldered their political responsibilities and strictly followed the &quot;Procurators Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; and &quot;Measures for the Management of Supervisory Officer Levels (Trial)&quot; and other relevant regulations to steadily and orderly advance the work of determining the level of supervisors for the first time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Each provincial-level Discipline Inspection Commission and Supervisory Committee took the initiative to report to the party committee at the same level and put forward suggestions for overall planning and promotion plans. The main leaders of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee presided over two meetings to study the determination of the level of supervisors; the Deep Reform Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee will promote the determination of the level of supervisors into annual work points and monitor the whole process; the main leaders of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee issued instructions twice, requiring careful attention Organize and implement meticulously. Under the leadership of party committees at the same level, the Discipline Inspection and Supervision Commissions of Hebei, Shandong, Shanghai, Sichuan, Zhejiang, Jilin, Jiangxi and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps studied and issued work guidance opinions, detailing the scope of personnel, approval procedures, disciplinary requirements, etc. The Guangdong production and hair production work template provides key reminders on links or matters prone to errors; Hainan establishes a problem ledger to study and solve existing problems one by one to ensure accurate grasp of policies, standard work procedures, and strict disciplinary requirements. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Considering the determination of the level of supervisors as an important task, the disciplinary inspection and supervision agencies at all levels conscientiously organize and implement it and advance it prudently and steadily. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Supervisory Commission issued 2 questions and answers on the first determination of supervisory officer levels, carefully answered inquiries from various places, promptly summarized and published the experience and practices of the completed provinces, and promoted exchanges and mutual learning. Provincial Discipline Inspection Commissions and Supervisory Committees, based on actual conditions, generally adopt methods such as issuing question and answer sessions, holding special training courses, and carrying out policy presentations to strengthen guidance and standardize procedures. The Discipline Inspection and Supervision Commissions of Gansu, Henan, Hubei, Liaoning, Shaanxi, Tianjin, Yunnan, Chongqing, Anhui and other places have established a working mechanism in which the main responsible comrades take the lead, the leaders in charge are responsible, the organizational departments organize the implementation, and the functional departments closely cooperate, and set up special work teams , take the initiative to strengthen communication and docking with the Party Committee Organization Department, institutional establishment and other departments, and work together to study and solve problems. Guizhou has selected some municipal (state) Discipline Inspection and Supervision Commissions to conduct field surveys to study and solve existing difficult problems; Qinghai has organized special dispatch meetings according to different time nodes; since November, Ningxia has insisted on &quot;daily reporting&quot; to solve policy confusion encountered and process control and other issues; Shanxi summarizes the progress of the province&#39;s work every month, provides &quot;point-to-point&quot; supervision and guidance for slow progress, and ensures that the work determined by the inspector for the first time is advanced in layers and carried out in an orderly manner. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Insist on putting political standards first, strictly standardize conditions, and strictly review and control. Discipline Inspection and Supervision Committees at all levels strictly compare the conditions for serving as supervisors, conduct a comprehensive survey of institutions, personnel, establishment, etc., comprehensively consider the performance of cadres&#39; moral integrity, job grades, etc., and scientifically and rationally determine grades in accordance with regulations and laws. Together with organizations, public security, economic and credit and other units, we will review the cadres’ academic qualifications, annual assessments, party conduct and clean government, credit reports, spouses and children’s immigration abroad (overseas), etc., and will not confirm those who do not meet the conditions. At the same time, we actively explain policies, provide ideological guidance, and take the initiative to have heart-to-heart conversations with cadres to ensure the ideological stability of the team. Fujian will review and judge one by one the establishment status, job rank, length of service, assessment rewards and punishments, academic qualifications, personal matters, party style and integrity of the cadres to be included in the determined scope; Tibet will establish accounts and list specific lists according to the cadre management authority. Check carefully and confirm again and again. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Taking the opportunity of carrying out the first determination work, efforts will be made to promote the construction of a team of high-quality professional inspectors. Constitutional oaths, targeted training, knowledge competitions and other forms are commonly used in various places to educate and guide cadres to faithfully perform their legal duties and obligations, continuously enhance the awareness of the rule of law, procedures and evidence, and improve the level of standardization, rule of law and formalization. Combining thematic education and educational rectification, we should deepen the internalization and transformation of the party&#39;s innovative theories, highlight practical training and practical exercises, and vigorously improve the political quality and disciplinary and legal literacy of inspectors. Beijing compiled the &quot;Handbook of What Inspections and Supervisors Should Know and Should Meet&quot; and made public examinations a necessary process for determining the level of inspectors; Guangxi organized knowledge tests on party discipline and laws and regulations; Xinjiang relied on the online learning platform of the discipline inspection and supervision system to organize learning for disciplinary inspection and supervision cadres Relevant policies: Hunan guided 14 cities and states to hold ombudsman constitutional oath ceremonies to enhance the sense of professional responsibility and honor. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“In the next step, we will guide all localities to carry out the regular determination and promotion of the level of inspectors in accordance with the provisions of the Inspectors Law and the Measures for the Administration of Levels of Inspectors.” Central Commission for Discipline Inspection National Relevant comrades from the Organization Department of the Supervisory Committee said. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[以自伤自残来控制对方也是家暴：应确认成年人自负其责原则丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261570]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, the Supreme Court released a number of typical cases against domestic violence. One of the cases was: Li repeatedly threatened his wife Wang by jumping off a building and drinking pesticide in front of her at her workplace. In order to ensure personal safety, Wang applied to the court for a personal safety protection order. The court held that: Li&#39;s self-injury behavior would cause Wang to feel nervous and fearful, which was a mental violation. Wang&#39;s application met the legal conditions for a personal safety protection order. Ruling: Li is prohibited from committing domestic violence against Wang; Li is prohibited from harassing, stalking, and threatening Wang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The typical significance of this case is expressed as: &quot;The harm of mental violence is not less than the harm of physical violence. In this case, although the respondent did not commit any acts such as beating or mutilation, the applicant The person causes physical injury, but his self-injury and self-mutilation behavior will definitely make the applicant feel nervous and fearful, causing the applicant to be mentally unstable and act according to the applicant&#39;s will. This behavior is mental violence.&quot; &quot;Clearly adopted The behavior of harming oneself in order to control the other party is also considered domestic violence.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Theoretically, this case should establish the following rules: Either one of the spouses will cry, make trouble, and hang themselves, or threaten the other party to commit suicide. Injuring yourself to require the other party to meet your specific requirements (whether the request is reasonable or not) is an act of mind control/psychological violence/domestic violence against the other party, so the other party will receive judicial relief. Of course, it is necessary to ensure that men and women enjoy equal judicial protection, that new rules apply to both men and women, and that the principles of equal rights for men and women and equal rights and responsibilities for each party are respected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On social media, this case has received a lot of concern, discussion and questioning. It is necessary to ask questions: The man threatens the woman by jumping off a building or going to her workplace to drink pesticides. What is the content of the threat? The basic facts of the case only state that &quot;both parties often have disputes over trivial family matters.&quot; The content of the dispute and the positions of both parties are crucial to determining who is right and wrong. From the &quot;frequent disputes&quot; between the two parties to the &quot;self-injury&quot; of the man, the conflict has an escalation process. How is this escalation completed? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The title of this case is: &quot;Wang&#39;s application for a personal safety protection order case - threatening others through self-injury and self-harm is domestic violence&quot;, and the set keywords are &quot;self-injury, self-harm, mental control&quot;. The logical chain from self-injury to mental control/psychological violence/domestic violence is: one party says &quot;If you don&#39;t agree to my request and don&#39;t act according to my will, I will hurt myself&quot; + this means that the other party &quot; Produce tension and fear&quot; and cause the other party to &quot;not be free mentally.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, there are two points that may deserve further discussion. First, according to this logical chain, many different types of &quot;verbal violence&quot; by one party should also be recognized as mind control/psychological violence/domestic violence, because they can also cause the other party to &quot;generate tension and fear&quot; and cause the other party to &quot; The spirit is not free.&quot; For example, one party devalues ​​the personality, dignity and achievements of the other party through habitual and persistent complaints or derogatory and insulting remarks, in order to lower the other party&#39;s self-evaluation and thereby better manipulate the other party; or one party Make ridiculous or harsh demands, make exaggerated or false accusations against the other party, force the other party to give up their rights and self-esteem, and hand over control of their property and income, in order to control the other party mentally and financially. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Back to the above case, some netizens asked: &quot;Both parties often have disputes over trivial family matters.&quot; So during the dispute, did the woman commit &quot;verbal violence&quot; or mental violence against the man? If the man unilaterally and continuously engages in mental control/psychological violence/domestic violence against the woman through self-mutilation, why not file for divorce? In current judicial practice, domestic violence is a very sufficient cause for divorce. From the above details, it is difficult to see the necessity of maintaining this marriage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From this we might as well extend our thinking: In a relationship between a lover or a couple, if one party injures himself or herself, does the other party need to be held responsible for this? The answer is self-explanatory. Because self-injury persons, as persons with full capacity for civil conduct and adults of sound mind, should bear their own responsibility and bear all the consequences of their actions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, a court in Inner Mongolia decided a case, which caused huge controversy. The prosecutor alleged: On September 28, 2020, E Moumou drove his wife Chao Moumou to the Tongug Nur Pastoral Area of ​​Bayanhot Town to visit their daughter in a car. The two had a quarrel and dispute over whether they needed to go to the pastoral area to visit their daughter. While the vehicle was driving, Chao suddenly opened the rear door of the vehicle and jumped out of the vehicle. He died of severe brain injury after landing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Media reports are more specific: The man drove his wife to see their 3-year-old daughter. The two of them kept quarreling over the issue of &quot;eating hot pot&quot; on the way... The wife said that she just wanted to eat hot pot now and didn&#39;t want to see the children. The man insisted on seeing the child first. When the wife saw that her husband had no intention of turning the car around to take her to eat hot pot, she became angry and made an unexpected move: she opened the door and jumped out of the car while the car was still running. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, the court held that the man&#39;s &quot;overconfidence&quot; caused the death of one person, constituting the crime of negligent death, and sentenced the man to two years in prison and three years of probation. The problem is that the woman did not give any warning before jumping out of the car. According to the rules and legal principles established by the above-mentioned typical cases of the Supreme Court, jumping from a car is like jumping off a building or taking pesticides. It is an act of self-harm. The person should also know the consequences of his actions, and there is no reason to hold the other party responsible. Article 66 of the Road Traffic Safety Law also stipulates: Passengers... shall not act in a manner that affects the driver&#39;s safe driving. It is impossible to establish such rules and legal principles: In the relationship between husband and wife, if one party harms himself or threatens the other party to obey, if he does not die, he will exercise mental control/mental violence/domestic violence on the other party. If he dies, it will be the other way around, and the other party will be responsible. criminal responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, the only correct rule is that adults and no one else should be held responsible for their actions. To &quot;strive to make the people feel fairness and justice in every judicial case&quot;, the rules and legal principles presented in each case in judicial practice should be reasonable, consistent and systematic, so that the people can have stable expectations and Sense of fairness and justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 18:25:17 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“并案处理”应被精细化对待丨法眼]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261628]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/30/LAZyzv4x2zmzMca5us0hEL7XM29DdGTculyOSKr5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/LAZyzv4x2zmzMca5us0hEL7XM29DdGTculy OSKr5. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260149&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the &quot;anti-gang and evil&quot; campaign, cases often appear to be merged. The picture shows that on October 28, 2019, the public security organs of Wuhu City, Anhui Province held an exhibition of the results of the special struggle against gangs and evil. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(People&#39;s Vision/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In criminal cases, a case often goes through its own set of proceedings alone. However, under special circumstances, &quot;consolidated case processing&quot; will also occur, that is, multiple cases will be merged together for processing. According to the relevant provisions of our country, for cases in which the same person commits multiple crimes, joint crimes, or related crimes, the public security organs, people&#39;s procuratorates, and people&#39;s courts can handle the cases together. The original intention of consolidating cases is to allow judicial staff to handle cases more efficiently, and it has produced good results in practice. For example, it can better discover the truth, ensure consistency in sentencing, and generally improve the efficiency of litigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, in anti-gang and anti-telecommunication fraud cases, there have been huge cases involving hundreds of parties and spanning several months. At this time, some merged cases have not been handled as expected. Although it produces good results, it exposes some new problems that require urgent attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Unrefined systems and practices&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the whole, my country’s handling of consolidated cases lacks clear provisions in the Criminal Procedure Law, and at the same time, the provisions on judicial interpretation are at a low level. Defects such as overly general regulations and overly general provisions make the system not only less authoritative in judicial practice, but also less operable. This will inevitably affect the rights and interests of the parties after the case is merged, the choice of procedures, and the quality and duration of case handling. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, the rights of the parties concerned are not adequately protected. Case-handling agencies such as the police, prosecutors, and courts have greater decision-making power over whether and how to consolidate cases. Sometimes, some case-handling agencies will bring their own case-handling needs into decision-making. Whether and how cases can be consolidated often depends on whether it can make handling the case more convenient, and whether it will affect the rights of the parties is rarely considered. This results in that in practice, it is sometimes difficult for the same party in the same case to realize the rights that he should have had when the case was not consolidated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, in some combined cases, evidence will be used universally, and some evidence that was originally used only in one case will be used in another case. Some parties often make innocent confessions in order to get rid of the accusations against themselves, but these confessions may contain information that proves the guilt of others. In the absence of consolidated cases, once the defendant obtains a not guilty verdict, he is only a witness in other people&#39;s cases. At this time, he could refuse to appear in court to accuse other defendants due to immunity from testifying by relatives or other reasons. However, when the cases are combined, he essentially has the identity of the defendant in both cases, and the evidence proving the guilt of others in the innocent confession can be used in the entire case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is that the parties’ right to choose procedures is unduly affected. With the continuous development of consultative criminal justice, our country&#39;s criminal proceedings have given parties the right to make voluntary choices in some special procedures. When certain conditions are met, the parties can choose whether to apply summary procedures and expedited adjudication procedures, and can also make a judgment on whether to appeal. However, these options will be affected when cases are consolidated. According to my country&#39;s current litigation rules, the application of these two procedural diversion mechanisms must obtain the consent of all defendants. When there are differences of opinion between defendants, some defendants who wish to have a trial as soon as possible may not be able to use summary procedures or expedited adjudication procedures. Similarly, the second instance procedure in my country&#39;s criminal proceedings also stipulates that in cases of joint crime, as long as some defendants appeal, the entire case must be reviewed and handled together. A defendant who has no intention of appealing will be forced to enter the second instance procedure because other defendants file a second instance. For these defendants who had no intention of appealing, they could have obtained an effective judgment immediately after the first instance, but the mandatory second instance procedure extended the time they had to wait for the judgment. During this time, they suffer from the uncertainty of the final verdict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, merging cases without an upper limit will affect the quality of case handling. In practice, sometimes large cases involving dozens or even hundreds of defendants will be consolidated. Compared with splitting into multiple cases, giant cases require coordination among more parties and take up more time in preparation and trial procedures. Case handlers have to deal with the process of determining the facts and convicting and sentencing each person being prosecuted. The balance also requires more energy than ordinary cases, and improper handling will have a negative impact on the quality of case handling and the fairness of the results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fourth, it may delay the handling of the case. The Criminal Procedure Law does not clearly stipulate the calculation of the time limit after the merger of cases, and the judicial interpretation only provides principled provisions on the time limit for joint trials, requiring that cases that &quot;may cause excessive delay in trial&quot; should avoid joint trials. But in fact, there is no operational standard for what constitutes “excessive delay.” Some case-handling agencies are not efficient in their work and are more willing to delay the litigation time. They will use cases with long remaining periods as the basis for the deadlines of newly merged cases. This leads to the fact that when the deadline for handling previously accepted cases is approaching, some case handlers will use newly incorporated cases as a reason to extend the deadline. As a result, merging cases has become a means for some investigators to extend the time of handling cases. It is a pity that the current system for combining cases has not yet identified and standardized this. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Refined systems promote refined practices&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In order for merger processing to better fulfill its original value and intention, it needs to be improved within the existing institutional framework. We believe that the handling of combined cases should focus more on the protection of the rights of the parties. Large cases need to be split reasonably, the time limit for handling the case should be strictly limited, and the parties should be given more room for procedural choices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, we must pay attention to the protection of the rights of the parties. Our country&#39;s merger of cases is dominated by public power, and some unreasonable phenomena have appeared in the protection of the rights of the parties. In order to change this situation, efforts need to be made from two aspects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, it is necessary to ensure that the parties concerned enjoy the same rights when the case is consolidated as when the case is not consolidated. The International Criminal Court&#39;s &quot;Rules of Procedure and Evidence&quot; stipulate that for cases tried jointly, the parties should enjoy the same rights as if they were tried separately. Inspired by this, it is necessary for our country to emphasize in the litigation rules that regardless of whether the cases are merged or not, the parties have the same rights and treatment in the litigation - the rights enjoyed by the parties in the division of cases cannot be limited because of the merger of cases. reduce. Regardless of whether cases are merged or divided, and no matter what other purposes are pursued, the rights of the parties to a fair trial need to be protected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, it is necessary to establish the parties’ right to apply and improve the parties’ right to object. In terms of the right to apply, in addition to being decided by the public authority, case consolidation can also be initiated upon application by the parties. This can allow the parties’ demands to be taken more seriously during the merger process. In terms of the right to object, we must take seriously the objections raised by the parties to the merger procedure and protect these objections from being expressed smoothly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the parties need to be given more choices. In criminal proceedings, the lengthy proceedings themselves are a kind of torment and a kind of punishment. In order to minimize the burden of litigation, parties should be able to enjoy the same right to choose whether to merge cases or not. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, in the pre-trial conference system, the right of the person being pursued to choose when combining cases should be emphasized. Since the actual trial has not yet entered, pre-trial conferences can effectively resolve and prevent some procedural issues. However, the relevant judicial interpretations in our country do not emphasize that &quot;whether there are objections to the merger and division of cases&quot; is something that can be discussed during the pre-trial conference stage. This situation should be added to the relevant provisions of the pre-trial conference to expressly indicate the pre-trial conference This stage allows the parties involved in the case consolidation to express their opinions on the case consolidation. If the person being pursued cannot reach an agreement between the summary procedure, the expedited procedure and the ordinary procedure, it is necessary to discuss and consider the possibility of dividing the case at the pre-trial conference stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is to explore a divisible system for the second instance of combined cases. In our country, not all criminal cases are indivisible at the second instance stage. The Supreme People&#39;s Court has stipulated in its judicial interpretation that in cases with multiple defendants, the criminal facts of some defendants are unclear, the evidence is insufficient, or there are new criminal facts that need to be prosecuted, and the relevant crimes are not related to other co-defendants. , the people&#39;s court of second instance may handle these defendants separately based on the circumstances of the case. The second-instance rules for case consolidation can refer to this provision. When special circumstances similar to this provision occur during the case-consolidation process, unrelated defendants can also be separated in the second-instance procedure to avoid &quot;partial appeal, full appeal&quot;. case review” thereby depriving the parties of their right to appeal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Again, giant cases must be split up reasonably. When the handling costs of giant cases exceed a certain limit, it may consume too much judicial resources and have a negative impact on the fairness and efficiency of judicial decisions. To this end, two steps can be taken to promote the reasonable division of my country&#39;s giant cases from concept to technology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first step is to clearly establish the awareness of rational division of large cases. Article 136 of the International Criminal Court’s Rules of Procedure and Evidence stipulates that when combining cases has a greater negative impact on the fairness of the case than dividing the cases, even if they are jointly accused, they need to be tried separately. This concept of division of cases can be transplanted in our country&#39;s judicial practice. The highest judicial authority can use guiding cases or typical cases to encourage localities to conduct pilot trials of reasonable division of giant cases under the guidance of the principles of fairness, efficiency and proportionality, and gradually establish the relationship between the case-handling agencies and case-handling personnel. Awareness of reasonable division of cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second step is to improve the provisions on the reasonable division of cases system in relevant judicial interpretations based on the aforementioned work. The current judicial interpretations related to case consolidation do not stipulate whether and how cases that are no longer suitable for consolidation as the litigation activities of this department advance. Once case handlers decide to combine cases, even if unreasonably large cases arise, they rarely make adjustments to the division of cases. Therefore, relevant judicial interpretations need to be supplemented, requiring the case-handling agencies to still handle separate cases as necessary after merging the cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, the time limit for handling the combined cases must be limited. In order to prevent the &quot;borrowing period&quot; of case handling, it should be prohibited to extend the case handling period by merging cases. That is to say, merging cases will not automatically lead to the extension of the case handling period. When the case handling period is insufficient, the case handling agency should apply for a legitimate extension for approval. procedures to extend the deadline for handling the case. At the same time, it is necessary to make it clear in the case-handling responsibility system that delaying litigation in the name of merging cases is an unreasonable way of handling cases, and case-handling personnel must bear corresponding case-handling responsibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author Liu Renwen is a researcher at the Institute of Law, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and Qin Han is a lecturer at the Law School of Zhejiang University of Technology)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 17:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
