Xie&#39;s injury was assessed as minor injury level two. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The procuratorial organ believed that although Li&#39;s act of injuring Xie was suspected of intentional injury, it was an act of injury carried out out of anger in the process of claiming his daughter&#39;s legitimate rights and interests from the school. Because Li was a first-time offender and an occasional offender, his behavior was justified and the circumstances were minor, and he had lenient and lenient punishment circumstances such as surrendering, so the decision was made not to prosecute. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for Xie Moumou, after the procuratorate initiated a public prosecution, the court sentenced him to two years and two months in prison for the crime of forced indecency, prohibiting him from engaging in sexual relations with minors from the date of completion of the sentence or the date of parole. Occupations with special responsibilities such as education, training, and nursing that are in close contact with people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Among netizens’ reactions, no one complained about his father Li’s beating of Xie to a minor injury, let alone treating it as “intentional injury.” Instead, there were various “beatings” &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;It&#39;s not an exaggeration to beat him to death&quot;. Does such a sound sound &quot;tyrannical&quot;? not at all. This is the manifestation of the &quot;simple sense of justice&quot; or &quot;emotion of law&quot; inherent in every normal person&#39;s heart. Indignation makes us human, and integrity must mean knowing what to love and what to hate. Confucius said: Only benevolent people can love others and hate others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Netizens also had complimentary words for the local procuratorate, such as &quot;the light of justice&quot; and &quot;wanting to send a banner.&quot; If the law were applied mechanically, the father could be prosecuted and sentenced if he beat someone to a minor injury of the second degree. There are many cases like this in reality: one spouse cheats, the other catches the cheater in bed, and beats the lover wildly in anger. Then the lover goes to assess the injury. As long as the injury is minor, the other spouse will either pay for a settlement or be charged with intentional injury. Although it is legal to go to jail and let the attacker go to jail, it is against human ethics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, to some extent, the above cases reflect the conflict between natural law and statutory/statutory law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called natural law/natural rights simply means that laws are discovered, not invented or formulated, which is often referred to as &quot;natural law&quot;. From the perspective of evolutionary game theory, natural law is the embodiment of &quot;evolutionary stable strategy&quot; (ESS). Tit for retaliation, or what Confucius said, &quot;repay kindness with kindness, repay hatred with directness&quot; is ESS. Only in this way , can promote cooperation among members of society, suppress breach of trust and aggression, and enable society and civilization to survive. The final rule derived from &quot;reciprocity&quot; is that each other respects each other&#39;s life, freedom and property rights, as the Chinese say, &quot;Kill to pay for life, debt to pay for money.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Statutory law is made by people and will refer to natural law or customary law, but it is not always consistent with natural law or customary law, and sometimes even runs counter to it. In the fields of marriage, family and property inheritance, there are many cases Reflects the conflict between statutory law and natural law or customary law. The only daughter, Ms. Yang, wanted to inherit her parents&#39; inheritance, but found that 22 relatives of both parents also had the right to inherit (based on statutory law). Fortunately, these relatives did not think they had the right to inherit the inheritance of Ms. Yang&#39;s parents (based on natural law and common law). This is Heaven governs people&#39;s hearts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Back to the case where his father Li beat Xie. Xie obviously knew how to use legal weapons to protect himself. After being beaten, he immediately identified the injury as &quot;minor injury level two&quot;, which showed that he He also suffered injuries, using this as a bargaining chip, or wanting to offset the disadvantages he faced in the molestation case, because minor injuries can be administratively detained, and minor injuries can be sentenced to prison. The show is &quot;I go to jail, you also go to jail, let&#39;s go together.&quot; posture. Judging from the local procuratorate&#39;s handling of both cases, it is obvious that the police also completed the investigation into the beating case of his father Li and handed it over to the prosecutor. It can be inferred that Xie reported the case to the police after being beaten. Reporting the crime + injury assessment, the direction of counterattacking Li is very obvious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that the local procuratorate’s decision not to prosecute Li has resolved the conflict between natural law and statutory law in this incident. It is in accordance with the laws of nature and people’s hearts, and it is for the father Li to stand up for his daughter. The behavior and morality are very good, and it is also a good deterrent to those who try to extend their dirty hands to minors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How do individuals deal with conflicts between natural law and statutory law? My father, Li, is a good example. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different statutory provisions and different judgments based on them mean different behavioral incentives for people and will change people&#39;s behavior. For example, the case of Datong, Shanxi, where she was accused of rape after getting engaged, triggered strong concerns and debates. , one of the motives discussed by everyone is &quot;how to avoid legal risks&quot;, but generally speaking, when the rights of parents and children are violated, the emotions and temperament of blood thicker than water will prevail, at least they will be very angry, and often stand Come out, instead of blindly looking forward and backward, timid, and appearing particularly &quot;rational and calm&quot;. If a person does not show blood and courage at this time, then he probably does not have these things at all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every father and mother who stands up for their children is worthy of respect. When their children are hurt and most vulnerable and helpless, they stand up to confront the aggressor and expose the aggressor&#39;s evil deeds to the broad daylight. This is the best help and the best value for their children. educate. They let their children know that when they are hurt, their parents are their strongest backing and support; they must be as brave as their parents, dare to say no to infringements and infringers, and dare to advocate and defend their rights. If there are more parents like this, not only will those who are ready to make a move think twice about it, but they will also convey a strong and profound value system to the next generation and the whole society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国家卫健委：9月20日起将猴痘纳入乙类传染病进行管理]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256733]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-15 13:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;strong>;National Health Commission Announcement&lt;/ strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;According to the relevant provisions of the &quot;Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China on the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases&quot;, monkeypox will be included in the management of Class B infectious diseases from September 20, 2023.

In the past, it mainly occurred in Central and West Africa. Since May 2022, monkeypox epidemics have occurred in more than 100 countries and regions around the world. Epidemics in many countries have shown that monkeypox has been transmitted from person to person and has spread widely to countries and regions outside Africa, with a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%. In September 2022, my country reported its first imported case of monkeypox, and local monkeypox epidemics began to appear in June 2023. Currently, more than 20 provinces across the country have reported monkeypox cases, triggering new local secondary outbreaks and hidden transmission. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The National Health Commission and the State Administration for Disease Control and Prevention conscientiously implement the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, treat monkeypox as a new emerging infectious disease, and give full play to their multiple capabilities.

This year’s Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holiday runs from September 29 to October 6.

With the development of high-speed rail networks, the popularity of private cars and the expansion of air routes, regular-speed lines have ceased operations in recent years. For example, at Shantou Station in eastern Guangdong Province, all regular-speed trains have been suspended. The surrounding Jieyang South Station and Chaozhou Station have already closed their passenger transportation services, which have nothing to do with passenger travel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In neighboring Japan, this phenomenon is even more obvious. With the aging of the population and the outflow of people to big cities, a large number of local railway lines in Japan have been abandoned and stations removed. Not only is the travel of local residents in towns and villages affected, but many beautiful scenery along the railway are also difficult to see again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How long has it been since you took a green train?

The typical image of a domestically violent man created by Feng Yuanzheng in the TV series has endured for a long time, and it has also made people regard &quot;domestic violence&quot; as a &quot;patent&quot; for men. But in addition to beating people hard, life also teaches people very patiently to grasp those seemingly unpopular facts - for example, domestic violence does not only occur between husband and wife, but also occurs between men and women, parents and children, and women against men. and children to parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Statistics from the All-China Women&#39;s Federation and the National Bureau of Statistics in 2018 show that 22.9% of women and 19.9% ​​of men in China have suffered domestic violence. It shows that there is not much difference between men and women experiencing domestic violence, which is very different from a certain stereotype. As for domestic violence by children against their parents, it is relatively hidden and is generally regarded as a family scandal. Parents who suffer domestic violence would rather swallow their anger than &quot;ruin&quot; their children&#39;s future. This is pitiful for parents in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, the Guangdong Provincial Higher People’s Court announced a typical case of domestic violence against an elderly man by his daughter because he was unwilling to rent out his house. In this case, Feng and Liu had a mother-daughter relationship. In early 2020, Liu forced Feng to move into his home in order to rent out Feng&#39;s house. After that, Liu went to Feng&#39;s residence many times to threaten, abuse and intimidate him, smashed items in the house with a hammer, and asked a moving company to remove Feng&#39;s appliances and furniture and change the door locks, making Feng unable to enter. residence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng applied to the court for a personal safety protection order, and sued Liu to return the items and restore Feng’s possession of the house. The People&#39;s Court of Xiangzhou District, Zhuhai City believed that the evidence submitted by Feng showed that he was indeed in danger of domestic violence, so it made a ruling the day after Feng applied for a habeas corpus order, prohibiting Liu from beating or threatening Feng. For violent behavior, Liu is prohibited from harassing, following, and contacting Feng, and Liu is prohibited from entering Feng&#39;s residence. Subsequently, the court presided over the mediation between the two parties, and Liu voluntarily vacated Feng&#39;s house within a time limit, returned Feng&#39;s belongings, and did not interfere with Feng&#39;s normal life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I saw the results, I couldn&#39;t help but sigh. After suffering inhuman treatment, the last thing a mother can do is the so-called &quot;reconciliation.&quot; How can the pain involved be covered by a piece of paper? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the private sector, it is not uncommon for children to force the elderly to give up their houses and intervene in the disposal of the houses in advance to lock in their &quot;deserved inheritance&quot;. In the eyes of these children, it is almost destined that their parents&#39; property will belong to them sooner or later. Therefore, once they go to war to control the possession of the property, it cannot be regarded as unfilial and rebellious. On the contrary, this is a kind of &quot;smartness&quot; that is carefully laid out for its own &quot;rights&quot;. I believe this is what this daughter thinks. If the mother had not been forced to litigate, and if the court had not supported her, the outcome of this matter would have been even worse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a long time, people have been easily confused by the interdependent and unbreakable relationship between parents and children, and thus are unwilling to connect the dark things in human nature with this relationship, even if there is a strong conflict of interest between parents and children. , is also likely to be regarded as a common household chore by the world. When I was young, I witnessed other people’s sons and daughters-in-law rushing into my old mother’s house with tools, quarreling and fighting. The old mother screamed in agony, unable to do anything. The villagers who were watching only regarded this matter as &quot;a slap in the face that can&#39;t make a difference&quot;, and had no idea that this behavior was a kind of domestic violence from below to above. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, domestic violence between parents and children also involves &quot;top versus bottom&quot;. It is common for parents to abuse their children for a long time, and to severely control their children&#39;s bodies and minds even when they grow up. Those who are accused often defend themselves under the guise of &quot;disciplining children.&quot; This is also confusing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why people &quot;cannot see&quot; domestic violence between parents and children, so that they turn a blind eye to it, is fundamentally because they trust too much in the ethical and moral foundation of the parent-child relationship, or they look at the parent-child relationship through filters. The contradictions in the family relationship are gradually resolved by trying to minimize the big problems and look for the best in everything. However, the unwillingness to admit the &quot;evil&quot; in the parent-child relationship and the unwillingness to expose the &quot;family scandal&quot; between parents and children has caused us to lose many opportunities to say &quot;no&quot; loudly and intervene in such domestic violence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Only from the perspective of rights can we better understand the confusion of such views in the past, and can we suddenly understand the harmfulness of &quot;parent-child domestic violence&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few years ago, the media reported such a case: The Procuratorate of Qiubei County, Yunnan Province accused Wang of being held criminally responsible for intentional homicide. However, it also pointed out that the victim had often beaten his parents in recent years. In view of the fact that the victim had It is a serious fault, and Wang has the circumstances of surrendering. The circumstances are relatively minor. It is recommended that the court impose a prison sentence of not less than 3 years but not more than 5 years. The Houqiubei County Court sentenced Wang to 3 years in prison, suspended for 5 years, for intentional homicide. The key word in this case is of course &quot;domestic violence&quot;. The domestic violence against the parents by the &quot;rebellious son&quot; has reached the point where the victim cannot bear it, which is the root cause of the tragedy of murder. Murderers should be punished by law, and the lessons of domestic violence should be remembered by the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An unavoidable question is why some children are so cruel to their parents that they are willing to violate ethics and morals and be nailed to the pillar of shame? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are indeed many reasons. Many parents dote on their children so much that they develop domineering and extreme personalities. If they are not satisfied, they will have violent outbursts, causing &quot;backlash&quot;. But this is only a general reason, and we can find the &quot;inducers&quot; of &quot;parent-child domestic violence&quot; from the details. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take the case of a daughter’s domestic violence against her mother as an example. The daughter’s coveting of her mother’s property was the ideological beginning of a series of extreme behaviors. According to the daughter&#39;s principles of dealing with things, if the mother obediently obeys without any resistance, domestic violence is unlikely to occur. But this kind of calculation is not in line with the righteousness of the world, nor is it in line with legal principles. By extension, using various decisive means to make the elderly lose control of their residence is domestic violence with deprivation of property as its core feature. This is where special attention should be paid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, one of the acts of domestic violence committed by children against their parents is on the physical and mental levels. It is not just forcing parents into a corner over property issues, but also forcing them into a desperate situation. Such domestic violence is of a nature Especially bad. And this kind of thing is often regarded by some people as a way to make a fortune. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to reports, in November 2021, such a case occurred in Nanjing: In order to drive their mother out of the house and monopolize the property they lived with, the couple actually staged a &quot;three knots and two divorces&quot; to transfer property. Drama, but fortunately the court ruled that the transfer of property was invalid. The judge emphasized that children have the obligation to support their parents and should ensure that their mothers have a place to live when they grow old. This is a simple truth, but it has been trampled on by some greedy children. Parents who have lost their financial security are like floating ducks in the world. You can imagine the physical and mental shock they suffered. This kind of domestic violence is even worse than physical violence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Comprehensively sort out the types of domestic violence, be more rational and keenly aware of the characteristics, harmfulness and deception of &quot;parent-child domestic violence&quot;, and curb this type of domestic violence in accordance with the law. This is to reshape the parent-child relationship and advocate A major premise of ethical order. We should not only show goodwill to the &quot;harbor&quot; in life, but also be vigilant about the truth about domestic violence that is obscured by routines, excuses and illusions. Only in this way can we truly create a normal atmosphere for ourselves and our family, without falling into a trap under the appearance of warm relationships and self-sacrifice, or even making ourselves a &quot;price&quot; in the calculations behind it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中科院博士讲述缅甸遭遇：因高薪被骗，坦言与学历无必然关系]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256661]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-15 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a doctor from the Chinese Academy of Sciences who was rescued a year after being deceived into Myanmar appeared and once again attracted attention. Nandu and N video reporters talked with the person involved, Mr. Zhang, and listened to his account of the twists and turns in the past year. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Mr. Zhang, last year, he faced financial difficulties due to the illness of his parents and girlfriend, so he chose to go abroad to seek job opportunities, but was lured to a fraud park in Myanmar by the so-called &quot;job in Thailand&quot;. They worked 18 hours a day under strict supervision, were punished corporally if they failed to complete their performance, and were severely beaten if they were found to have &quot;leaked secrets&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The news was spread online and received continued attention. Finally, with the efforts of many parties, Mr. Zhang was able to return to China. In his view, being defrauded has nothing to do with academic qualifications or experience. &quot;Fraud takes advantage of the weaknesses of human nature, and anyone can become a victim.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/0429ed8e0e9d65c317ac8f76739cd70c.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;490&quot; height=&quot;304&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/0429ed8e0e9d65c317ac8f76739cd70c.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250752&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Mr. Zhang. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“Targeted” because of his good English and broad knowledge&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“PhD from Chinese Academy of Sciences” and “Myanmar Fraud Group” are two things that were originally difficult to connect. Words make Mr. Zhang’s experience incredible. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Whether a person is deceived actually has nothing to do with academic qualifications or experience. Scams take advantage of the weaknesses of human nature, and anyone can become a victim.&quot; Mr. Zhang told a Nandu reporter . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he set out to go abroad in August last year, he expected that his new job abroad would alleviate the financial pressure he was facing at the time. Previously, he worked at the Lushan Botanical Garden of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Jiangxi. At that time, his parents I have a chronic illness and my girlfriend has early-stage breast cancer. This caused him to face great financial difficulties and had to look for new job opportunities. However, finding a job in China was not smooth. More than ten resumes came to nothing. &quot;He had no choice but to look for job opportunities abroad.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He recalled to Nandu reporters that he first learned through an intermediary online that a company in Singapore was recruiting customer service staff and promised a monthly salary of 15,000 yuan. At this time, the overall process seemed to him relatively formal. However, due to the impact of the epidemic at that time, Singapore&#39;s entry process was relatively complicated, and since he had not been vaccinated, the visa application was delayed, which delayed him for more than a month. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the trap has been set at this time, waiting for him to enter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Zhang told Nandu reporters that the recruiter told him that their company has a branch in Thailand and suggested that he go to Thailand to work for a period of time and wait until Singapore’s immigration policy is relaxed before transferring there. Mr. Zhang agreed. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After visiting several cities such as Hong Kong and Bangkok, in mid-August last year, he arrived in Mae Sot, Thailand, a small town on the border of Thailand and Myanmar, across the river from Myanmar. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“They never mentioned the word ‘Myanmar’ to me from beginning to end.” Mr. Zhang recalled to the Nandu reporter that the process was very short, only ten or twenty minutes. When they realized something was wrong, they had already taken them to the Myanmar side.&quot; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/c85dbc0d58ca784422614c900a7d7580.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;456&quot; height=&quot;482&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/c85dbc0d58ca784422614c900a7d7580.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250753&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Mr. Zhang introduced his experience of being deceived. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, he sent a message telling his girlfriend that he did not want to stay in Myanmar because it was not safe, but he had lost his personal freedom. He also tried to escape, but found himself heavily guarded and had to give up. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that while the news on the Internet that &quot;a doctor from the Chinese Academy of Sciences was deceived into Myanmar for a year&quot; has attracted widespread attention, at the same time, three men from Guizhou have repeatedly tried to smuggle themselves into Myanmar for telecommunications network Fraudulent activities, but due to low literacy and inability to type, the fraud company refused to accept them. Not only did they not make a fortune, but they were also sentenced to prison terms. Cases were also exposed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Zhang analyzed to Nandu reporters that the main reasons why he was targeted by the fraud gang include his advantage in English and his broad knowledge. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Being beaten to the point of being unable to stand for &quot;leaking secrets&quot;&lt;/strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is understood that the fraud in Myawaddy in eastern Myanmar mainly targets overseas groups. The one is &quot;European and American disk&quot;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“My job is to disguise myself as a woman and chat with the deceived through social software.” Mr. Zhang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He told Nandu reporters that there will be a &quot;salary&quot; in the first month after entering the fraud park, about 6,000 yuan. After that, the income will depend on performance commissions. If there is no performance, you will not get any money, and you will have to Accept corporal punishment. The corporal punishment includes running, push-ups, planks, frog jumps, squats, etc. If you do it continuously for more than an hour, someone will supervise you with a wooden stick from behind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Zhang revealed that he has never made money through performance. &quot;This situation is very common, and most people may not make any money in a year.&quot; Because now people are aware of the scams, fewer and fewer people are being deceived. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The park is very taboo about &quot;leaking secrets&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Zhang said that the park allows him to call his family at intervals. &quot;Because someone was monitoring my phone calls, I couldn&#39;t tell the truth. In many cases, people who defrauded the park would deliberately threaten me to reveal false information to the outside world.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, for a long time, , the family did not know his true situation. Later, Mr. Zhang discovered that he could install a mobile phone simulator on his computer and send emails in this way to get rid of surveillance, so he sent an email to his family in China asking for help. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On another occasion, he secretly contacted his girlfriend through chat software and talked about the company&#39;s fraud model, rules and regulations, corporal punishment methods, etc. &quot;Usually I delete the chat history after chatting with her, but that time I was negligent and didn&#39;t delete it in time. People from the company found out, which led to my arrest later.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Zhang still remembers that they The people were beaten with wooden sticks as thick as shins. &quot;I was beaten until I couldn&#39;t stand normally at all, and I could only lie on my stomach when sleeping.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He was detained from the end of April to the beginning of August this year. In the &quot;Army Station&quot;, it is similar to a private prison in the park. Later, he was moved to a dormitory, where he usually could only eat one meal a day, and it was irregular. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He once sent an email to tell his family that he was being monitored for 18 hours a day and that his escape was far away. He hoped that his family could rescue him. The park required a transfer of 120,000 yuan before releasing her, but after the transfer, her family found that their account had been frozen and they could not make the transfer. In early August, he was transferred to another company in the same group. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;After attracting attention, he became a &quot;hot potato&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Later, Mr. Zhang’s family chose to call the police . The news that &quot;it has been a year since a doctor from the Chinese Academy of Sciences was deceived into traveling to Myanmar&quot; was also disclosed and continues to attract attention. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“After the media reports, many people in the park knew about me. The company leaders thought that keeping me in the park would bring them trouble, so they decided to lower the ransom.” Mr. Zhang He told Nandu reporters that his family contacted Aaron, a volunteer who helped with the rescue, and negotiated with the park through him to finally determine the ransom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Mr. Zhang’s family paid the ransom of 59,000 yuan, he was able to regain his freedom. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, before leaving the park, he was required to acknowledge that he entered the park voluntarily by signing, videotaping, etc. &quot;I was eager to leave the park at that time, so I could only pretend to agree to their request.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 26, the Chinese Embassy in Thailand reported in the early morning that on the evening of the 24th, the Thai police successfully found Zhang. The Embassy in Thailand and the Consulate General in Chiang Mai are closely coordinating with the Thai police to arrange for his return to the country as soon as possible. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/16ac446e4ff21da9b26edf828295a912.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;740&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/16ac446e4ff21da9b26edf828295a912.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;250751&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Mr. Zhang appeared on Weibo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After more than ten days, no relevant news came out. Late at night on September 11, Mr. Zhang spoke out on Weibo and introduced the current situation, which once again attracted attention. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He revealed that he returned to China on September 5 and has been unable to publish due to cooperation with the investigation and personal illness and discomfort. In line with his responsible attitude towards the public and himself, he will explain some issues that everyone is concerned about in the future. The next morning, he posted again describing his encounter in more detail. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Zhang revealed to Nandu reporters, &quot;The police investigated me on September 5, and I also provided them with the information that I was deceived.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot; From the time the incident unfolded to the time I returned to China, I overcame numerous obstacles, and my rescue was the result of joint efforts from many parties.&quot; He said that this would not have been possible without the efforts of relatives and friends, including the assistance of official departments such as the police and the embassy, ​​as well as the private sector. The support of volunteers and media reports also played a very important role. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Talking about the current situation, Mr. Zhang said that his parents&#39; condition is relatively stable, and his girlfriend has recovered from early-stage breast cancer. He hopes to do his best to repay society in the future and prevent more people from falling into the same trap. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“Recognize your own character weaknesses”&lt;/strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Since this year, cases of Chinese people being deceived into Myanmar fraud gangs have been exposed frequently. Recently, Nandu reported on the case of Mr. Chen, a 20-year-old Chaoshan boy who was deceived into Myanmar and then rescued. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is understood that with the support of the police, many Chaoshan chambers of commerce participated in the rescue operation. Zheng Chucheng, president of the Harbin Guangdong Chaoshan Chamber of Commerce, told Nandu reporters that the rescue work was not easy, just like finding a needle in a haystack. Another person familiar with the matter said that to carry out rescue work, it is necessary to first determine the location of the victim. In this process, the victim&#39;s active self-rescue played a big role. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/0a43abf7ea56bcb259d265379813e61f.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;508&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/0a43abf7ea56bcb259d265379813e61f.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;250754&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Mr. Chen was rescued. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After losing contact for many days, Mr. Chen privately found an opportunity to send a message to his family, describing in detail the environment surrounding the fraud park where he was at that time. The personnel involved in the rescue quickly determined their location by integrating information from multiple parties, which provided important guarantee for subsequent rescue work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Zhang also told Nandu reporters that it is very important to ensure one&#39;s own safety during the process of self-rescue, especially to ensure that the distress signal is not discovered by people in the fraud park. &quot;I asked for help from the outside world through email, which is less likely to be exposed.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regarding the many cases of being deceived into Myanmar, Zheng Chucheng reminded, &quot;The pie will not fall from the sky. Looking for a job People should not believe in the temptation of high salaries, and business people should not fall into the trap of huge profits.&quot; The above-mentioned insider also said, &quot;Believe in the police&#39;s anti-fraud propaganda, support anti-fraud work, study hard, work hard, and don&#39;t believe in the so-called &quot;High salary.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;To avoid being deceived, on the one hand, you must recognize your own character weaknesses, and on the other hand, you must often learn and update your anti-fraud knowledge.&quot; Now that he has finally escaped, Mr. Zhang has a lot of emotions. . &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All parties are also intensifying their efforts to combat fraud gangs in Myanmar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is understood that in response to the current serious and complex situation of telecommunications network fraud crimes involving China in northern Myanmar, the Ministry of Public Security has deployed public security agencies in Yunnan and other places to continue to promote crackdowns. Recently, the Pu&#39;er Public Security Bureau of Yunnan Province has actively carried out border police cooperation with relevant local law enforcement departments in Myanmar. 1,207 fraud suspects from northern Myanmar were successfully handed over to us, including 41 fugitives online. This is after the previous capture of 269 fraud suspects from northern Myanmar. After the suspect was arrested, the crackdown achieved another major result. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The relevant person in charge of the Ministry of Public Security stated that the public security agencies will further strengthen border police law enforcement cooperation and continue to organize and carry out operations to crack down on telecommunications network fraud crimes involving China in northern Myanmar. Their determination and intensity will not decrease and they will continue to crack down on fraud. dens, arrest those involved in fraud in accordance with the law, and resolutely curb the high incidence of such crimes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, Mr. Zhang, who has returned to China, told Nandu reporters that working as a journal editor or science popularizer is his interest and specialty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I hope that through this kind of work, I can make some contribution to society.” He said. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[多地突发“雷暴哮喘”：半小时内发作，蒿属花粉或为元凶]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256694]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-14 23:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 14 Sep 2023 23:55:08 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
