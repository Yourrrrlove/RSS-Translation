In order to increase the production of razor clams, some fishermen illegally use pesticides on the tidal flats to kill and drive away the natural enemies of razor clams on the tidal flats. Visual China|Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Ming is still waiting for an explanation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A few months ago, many of the aquatic products in his fish pond suddenly died overnight, causing heavy losses. His fish pond is close to the seaside. Every time the tide rises on the first and fifteenth day of the lunar month, seawater is introduced into the pond to change the water. Three other farmer neighbors also suffered losses. They all changed the water on July 2, 2023 - the fifteenth day of the fifth lunar month. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Not only fish pond farmers such as Liu Ming are asking for gifts from the sea, but there are also razor clam (commonly known as &quot;razor clam&quot;) farmers in the tidal flats one or two kilometers away. Liu Ming and others suspected that razor clam farmers put pesticides on the tidal flats, forming &quot;poisonous water&quot; after high tide. They were introduced into the fish ponds just in time for the water change, poisoning the aquatic products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Ming said that they have reported the case and there is no investigation result yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Different organisms have different constitutions. As long as the appropriate dosage is mastered, pesticides can kill and drive away the natural enemies of razor clams on the tidal flats without affecting the razor clams. Huang Biaowu, a senior experimentalist at the School of Marine Biology of Xiamen Marine Vocational and Technical College who has long studied razor clam cultivation, told Southern Weekend reporters that the method of raising razor clams using pesticides on tidal flats currently exists in some coastal areas of my country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The most common of these pesticides is triazophos, which is mainly used to control pests in fruit trees, cotton, and food crops. However, it is illegal to use it in razor clam cultivation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The use of pesticides has increased the survival rate of a single razor clam species, but at the expense of biodiversity. The tidal flats are a transit point for millions of migratory birds around the world, and abundant shellfish are their food. At present, the residues, metabolic patterns and effects of pesticides on human health in razor clams have not been fully studied. Due to the difficulty of supervision and other reasons, this farming method has not been effectively managed in some coastal areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Kill natural enemies without poisoning razor clams&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Razor clams are a popular affordable seafood. Huang Biaowu told Southern Weekend reporters that there are currently many kinds of razor clams on the market. The razor clams sold are basically aquaculture products, and there are two main methods: pond culture and tidal flat culture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Early cultured razor clam seedlings were derived from wild seedlings, and wild razor clam seedlings were only produced in Zhejiang and Fujian, with limited quantities. More than ten years ago, after a breakthrough in artificial razor clam breeding technology, large-scale tidal flat farming methods emerged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73272&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70088&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/d678c245b9.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;Razor Clam 2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width= &quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;725&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/d678c245b9.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256461&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot; >;March 2022, Quanzhou, Fujian. In the morning, taking advantage of the lull in the tide, fishermen go to the tidal flats to salvage wild razor clam seedlings for sale. (Pictures and texts are unrelated) Visual China | Pictures&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;With the promotion of raising razor clams on tidal flats, beach clearing drugs such as triazophos have also become popular. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The rise and fall of the tide forms an intertidal zone thousands of meters wide, which is a treasure trove of biodiversity. In addition to razor clams, algae, snails, Abundant organisms such as shrimps, crabs, and small fishes also attract birds to feed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Huang Biaowu explained that when the razor clam seedlings are first released, they cannot penetrate very deep into the soil and can easily become food for other organisms on the tidal flats. In severe cases, razor clam farmers may even lose the seeds. receive. Triazophos can kill crabs, snails, gobies and other natural enemies of razor clams. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are many considerations in how to use triazophos and other drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Cheng, who once raised razor clams on the tidal flats, told Southern Weekend reporters that the traffic problem must be solved first. In the vast tidal flats, there are tens of thousands of acres of razor clam farms as far as the eye can see. If you cannot move with your feet alone, you will immediately fall into the mud. To do this, razor clam farmers ride on a homemade scooter-like tool called a &quot;mud sled.&quot; It is a long wooden board with slightly warped ends and a handrail in the middle. The driver can kneel on the board with one leg and push on the ground with the other leg, so that he can slide quickly on the mudflat. Four hundred years ago, it was the &quot;secret weapon&quot; used by the Qi army to defeat Japanese pirates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The dosage and area of ​​triazophos sprayed on the tidal flats need to be strictly controlled to achieve the purpose of killing natural enemies without poisoning razor clams. The razor clam breeding grounds are similar to field ridges, each about 150 meters wide, and the two stems are about 50 meters apart, making it easy for boating. The razor clam farmer tilts a 50-pound pesticide bucket behind the mud sled and moves forward in a straight line at a constant speed. The pesticide slowly flows out from the small eyes of the bucket, and it travels about 2 kilometers in an hour. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Cheng revealed that these triazophos were not purchased from the market. &quot;There are wholesalers who can directly contact them to deliver them to you.&quot; The time for spraying pesticides is usually before the spring tide. After the tide rises, the pesticides on the tidal flats will spread with the sea water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It was this &quot;hidden rule&quot; of farming that made Liu Ming and others suspect that the sudden loss of their fish pond after the water change was related to the use of pesticides to raise razor clams. This is not the first time similar incidents have occurred locally. Farmers have even summed up their experience. Before changing the water, they first ask the people at the beach if they find dead fish to judge whether the sea water is &quot;toxic&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Local razor clam seedlings are sown in March and harvested in March of the following year. Because when the weather gets colder, there are fewer natural enemies of razor clams near the shore, so the spraying time lasts from March to September, usually at most twice a month. &quot;The smell of triazophos is very pungent and very irritating.&quot; Li Cheng said that once he put triazophos in the car, and the unpleasant smell did not dissipate for several days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to media reports, in 2018, Lao Wang, who had been raising razor clams for 18 years in Dafeng, Yancheng, Jiangsu, suddenly developed chest tightness, dizziness, and fatigue. Doctors found that the culprit was Lao Wang. The organophosphorus pesticide used by Wang can kill cockroaches (a small organism commonly known as &quot;sea leather&quot;) that destroy the growing environment of razor clams. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition to triazophos, Li Cheng also used two pesticides, dichlorvos and imidacloprid, which were also used to kill the natural enemies of razor clams, but triazophos was used in the largest amount. . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Explicitly prohibited but difficult to supervise&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Pesticides such as triazophos, dichlorvos and imidacloprid are not used in aquaculture in compliance with regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;An expert in the field of aquatic products and fishery drugs said in an interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend that my country implements a white list system for aquaculture drugs. “The veterinary drugs for aquaculture in the white list have all undergone rigorous research on pharmacodynamics, toxicology, food safety and environmental impact, and have a relatively in-depth understanding of the effects of use and the rules of metabolic residues in aquatic products. Know.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chemical drugs outside the white list are not allowed to be used illegally. Pesticides such as triazophos used by razor clam farmers are not on the white list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There have been some studies on triazophos. An article published in 2007 by experts from the Zhejiang Provincial Institute of Marine Fisheries and other institutions mentioned that triazophos used in the process of raising razor clams can remain in edible tissues. Experimental simulation data shows that triazophos is present in razor clams. The accumulation and elimination speed in the drug are both fast. 24 hours after the drug was administered, the concentration of triazophos in the body reached 2.97mg/kg, and after 100 hours, it dropped to 0.021mg/kg. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Currently, my country has only set limits for triazophos in plant foods, and there is no standard to follow in aquatic products. Referring to the &quot;National Food Safety Standard Maximum Residue Limits of Pesticides in Food&quot; (GB 2763-2021), the maximum limit is 0.2mg/kg for fruits, and the minimum limit is 0.05mg/kg for cereals such as wheat and oats. The 24-hour data of the above study seriously exceeded the standard, but the 100-hour data did not exceed the standard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, because triazophos can easily cause excessive pesticide residues in vegetables, triazophos is not popular in vegetable planting. In 2013, the former Ministry of Rural Affairs stipulated that, Its use on vegetables is prohibited after December 31, 2016. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some places have clearly banned the use of triazophos for raising razor clams. For example, in 2017, Yueqing City, Zhejiang Province, one of the main producing areas of wild razor clam seedlings, issued the &quot;Notice on Prohibiting the Use of Pesticides in Shallow Beach Breeding&quot;, which strictly prohibited the use of triazophos, dichlorvos, sodium pentachlorophenol, and cypermethrin in shallow beach breeding. , imidacloprid and other pesticides, and residents are encouraged to stop and report violations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are also cases of punishment. In 2017, law enforcement officers from the Ninghai County Fishery Administration and Fishing Port Supervision and Management Station in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province discovered that someone was using triazophos during the cultivation of razor clams and were fined 10,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, it is very difficult to regulate the use of pesticides such as triazophos. Some coastal farmers told Southern Weekend reporters that this breeding method has been secretive for many years. To avoid public notice, razor clam farmers usually spray pesticides late at night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As early as 2014, Wang Songlin, chairman of the environmental organization &quot;Qingdao Marine Ecology Research Association&quot;, witnessed a group of razor clam farmers spreading triazophos on the tidal flats. The &quot;Razor Clam: China Offshore Breeding Assessment Report&quot; released by the Research Association in 2019 pointed out that the inconvenient transportation into the breeding tidal flat wetlands has brought many difficulties to supervision work. For example, people, vehicles, and ships cannot move forward on the muddy tidal flats, making it difficult for supervisors to locate evidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73273&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70089&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/01/fb36a6570f.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;Razor Clam 3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;718&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com /cms/medias/image/23/11/01/fb36a6570f.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256462&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;br>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In January 2023, farmers harvested razor clam seedlings in the tidal flat breeding area of ​​Yueqing Bay in Wenzhou, Zhejiang. (Pictures and texts are irrelevant) Visual China | Pictures&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Inertial thinking in farmland management&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Songlin said that not only razor clams, but also some economical shellfish For example, the tidal flat cultivation of variegated clams and the large-scale sea cucumber cofferdam breeding industry along the Yellow and Bohai Seas also have illegal use of chemicals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The &quot;Sea Cucumber: China Offshore Pond and Cofferdam Culture Assessment Report&quot; released by the Qingdao Marine Ecology Research Association in 2019 mentioned that the cofferdam culture of sea cucumbers is abused The chemical problem is more serious. For example, in order to prevent and treat diseases, antibiotics are used illegally in the nursery stage; pesticides and herbicides are illegally used in the breeding process to clear ponds and kill sea cucumbers&#39; natural enemies; excessive amounts of alum and illegal use of formaldehyde may also be used in the processing and sales of sea cucumbers. , causing the aluminum content and formaldehyde in sea cucumbers to exceed standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Raising razor clams on tidal flats not only destroys biodiversity through the use of pesticides, but also causes the death of birds by erecting anti-bird nets. A newly published study by Princeton University associate researcher Liang Dan and others found that during the peak spring migration period of migratory birds in April and May 2021, anti-bird nets erected for razor clam farming in Xinghua Bay, Fujian and Yueqing Bay, Zhejiang More than 13,000 shorebirds were trapped, many of which are nationally protected species. The research team also found similar anti-bird nets in 17 other locations in Zhejiang and Fujian. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liang Dan told Southern Weekend reporters that the above-mentioned tidal flats in the above two places specialize in breeding razor clam seedlings. The razor clam seedlings usually sprout from around November and grow until March or March of the following year. It can be harvested in April. If these bird-proof nets are removed immediately after razor clam seedlings are harvested in March and April, tens of thousands of birds migrating in spring can be saved, and part of the bird-proof nets can also be prevented from entering the sea and harming marine life. However, because it requires high labor costs to dismantle the nets on the tidal flats, the farmers will keep the nets on the tidal flats after selling the razor clam seedlings, waiting until typhoons to sweep away the nets in June or July. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In their natural state, razor clams are only part of the biodiversity of Hamada Wetland. To carry out aquaculture on legally protected natural tidal wetlands, Wang Songlin believes that fishermen have to accept the high natural mortality rate of razor clams - being predated by natural enemies and competing with other benthic animals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But it’s hard. Whether it is razor clams or sea cucumbers, the use of banned chemicals such as organophosphorus and pyrethroid pesticides in the breeding process reflects the farmers&#39; inertial thinking: managing natural tidal flats and coastal zones as farmland, and treating aquaculture products as a single type of &quot; crop&quot;. &quot;I asked an old couple who came back from spraying pesticides. They were very enthusiastic and said frankly that the beach is no different from a cotton field. To ensure a high yield of razor clams, other fish, shrimps, crabs, and shellfish must be killed with pesticides, and long-billed waterfowl must be driven away.&quot; Wang Songlin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There is an old saying: &quot;April razor clams are plump and plump, so don&#39;t let Xishi&#39;s tongue down.&quot; April is the most plump season for razor clams, but it is not an eco-friendly time to eat them. . Because spring and autumn are also the peak seasons for migratory birds, reducing the interference from human activities such as spraying pesticides to clear the beach and firing cannons to drive away birds on natural tidal wetlands is of great significance to ecological protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;How to resolve these contradictions, Yueqing City, Zhejiang Province advocates the use of boat cultivators, quicklime, bleaching powder, drying and other methods to clear beaches and ponds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Huang Biaowu suggested that farmers return to the old method of pond farming. For pond culture, eco-friendly quicklime and Chinese medicinal materials can be used instead of triazophos in clear ponds. Raising razor clams in ponds requires fertilizer and water, which is equivalent to fertilizing crops. Raising razor clams in ponds can also use the tail water discharged from other fish ponds as fertilizer water to purify the organic matter rich in nitrogen, phosphorus and other organic matter in the tail water, turning waste into treasure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Liu Ming and Li Cheng are pseudonyms)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 02 Nov 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[俄罗斯铝业公司创始人奥列格·德里帕斯卡：没有特斯拉汽车，大家还是会活下去的]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259777]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-02 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The Mandarin Oriental Hotel is located on Wangfujing Street in Beijing, overlooking the Forbidden City. On the evening of October 25, 2023, in the luxurious conference hall box on the fifth floor, Oleg Deripaska, the founder of Rusal, was waiting for the visiting media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Oleg Deripaska was once the founder of the world&#39;s largest aluminum company. In the interview, he claimed to be a &quot;Soviet-era physicist&quot; and graduated from the Physics Department of Moscow State University in his early years. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, academic funding dropped sharply, and there were no subsidies or grants, which made it impossible for him to continue physics research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After leaving school, he and his colleagues established a trading company to export metals from Russia. Later, he used the first pot of gold he earned to acquire the third largest electrolytic aluminum plant in Russia, which became his The starting point of your career. Later, through asset merger, he established the world&#39;s largest aluminum company, Rusal. This company was listed in Hong Kong in 2015, becoming the first Russian company to be listed in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2018, the United States imposed sanctions on Deripaska and 23 other Russian tycoons and officials, and he was included in the United States&#39; Specially Designated Nationals List (SDN). After entering this list, the Office of Foreign Assets Control under the U.S. Department of the Treasury will freeze its property and property interests within the jurisdiction of the United States. U.S. citizens and entities located in the United States are generally prohibited from conducting any form of transaction or business with individuals or entities on the SDN list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This list affects not only the individuals or entities on the list, but also third parties with whom they do business. Transactions with entities on the list may result in violations of U.S. sanctions regulations, thereby Face legal consequences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Oleg Deripaska was sanctioned by Australia, Canada, EU countries, the United Kingdom and other countries after the Russia-Ukraine conflict began. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/fQStqglwidgSDAi5dVMiyvWSx6s8WSQcKTMpNnVC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1589&quot; height= &quot;1192&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/fQStqglwidgSDAi5dVMiyvWSx6s8WSQcKTMpNnVC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256469&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Russian aluminum king Oleg Deripaska. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhou Yubo/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What is the purpose of your visit to China this time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Oleg Deripaska:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I am a member of the Board of Trustees of Lomonosov Moscow State University. We visited BIT Moscow State University in Shenzhen , a joint university founded by Lomonosov Moscow State University and Beijing Institute of Technology. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have opened an International Business School, as well as a School of Mathematics and Physics. Previously, Moscow State University held an international class. About twenty or thirty students from different countries came to Moscow State University to study mathematics and physics, and 30% of them were Chinese students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Russian mathematics education is the best in the world, and we hope to promote such academic exchanges. At the same time, Chinese students can learn Russian, and Russian students can learn Chinese. We need to invest in transportation facilities and financial facilities, but we also need to invest in science education. Some scientific projects may not seem very important now, but in twenty or fifty years, they will become the key to the development of human society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How do you view the current fluctuations in the ruble? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Oleg Deripaska:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The problem of ruble fluctuations certainly exists because we now have a military conflict, but Russia’s settlement balance is still very powerful. As long as there are no major conflicts in the next two or three years, ruble fluctuations will not be a big problem, because Russia&#39;s resource industry is still quite good. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;At the beginning of the year, you thought Russia needed to welcome more people from Investment from friendly countries, so what else can be done to promote cooperation between Chinese and Russian enterprises? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Oleg Deripaska:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;First, it takes time. The foundation of economic cooperation between the two countries is trust. We already have a foundation of trust. . Previously, 70% of Russian industry relied on European technology. Now it still takes time to transform, change our national standards, and cooperate with our friendly countries. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you have a problem, you must solve it in time, and don&#39;t let it accumulate later. Entrepreneurs, including me, have raised this question before, why is Russia’s foreign trade so unbalanced? 80% comes from Europe and 20% comes from Asia. We need to find a balance. In the next two or three years, we will work hard to solve the problems that have not been solved before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, we must invest in infrastructure, not just logistics facilities, but also financial platforms. The financial platform is not just a settlement issue. The two countries have learned how to settle in their own currencies, but the debt market has not yet achieved the results we want. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ten years ago, the Russian automobile industry began to talk about import substitution, but they did not start to do it until the problems had arisen.

The shop... is surrounded by an industrial park, and there is only one commercial place around. It is very lively here during meals and commuting, and these shops are running well. I have been working here since the building was built, and most of these shops have been operating here since the beginning, so I know many of the merchants and often chat with them while shopping. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three years ago, the proprietress of the Shaxian snack bar downstairs returned to Fujian to accompany her children in high school. Recently, I saw her when I was eating at a snack bar in Shaxian County, and asked, &quot;Are you back from studying with me?&quot; She said, &quot;Back!&quot; I asked again, &quot;Which university did your child go to after the college entrance examination?&quot; She scratched her head and answered. : &quot;I don&#39;t know!&quot; I asked: &quot;You have been studying with your child for three years, and you have achieved results after three years. You don&#39;t know what your results are?&quot; She still shook her head and said, &quot;I really don&#39;t know...anyway ...It seems to be from our side...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two days later, I went to the small supermarket nearby to buy something. The small supermarket was run by a couple, they were from Anhui, and the male owner I am explaining to the hostess, don’t forget to transfer living expenses to the child. I asked, &quot;Is your child going to college?&quot; They nodded and said they just went to college this year. I continued to ask: &quot;Which university does the child go to?&quot; The male host lowered his head and thought for a moment, and said, &quot;I can&#39;t remember either.&quot; I looked at the hostess, and she said, &quot;Don&#39;t ask me, I can&#39;t either.&quot; I know...&quot; the male host interjected, &quot;He said he was in Chengdu... studying design... or something else...&quot; I couldn&#39;t help but be dumbfounded and joked: &quot;You two don&#39;t know what&#39;s important! You two only know how to transfer it to your children. Living expenses!&quot; They both looked at each other, not understanding what I was laughing at. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, most couples or one spouse works outside the home and the children study in their hometown. If one spouse works outside the home, the life of the spouse at home will focus on the child&#39;s studies and spend time accompanying them to school. Both husband and wife work outside the home, and many people choose to go back to study with their children at some important stages and moments, such as the third year of junior high school, the third year of high school, etc. This is all in the hope that by accompanying them to study, they can help their children learn so that they can get into the ideal school. However, when I heard that the proprietress of a snack bar in Shaxian County accompanied her child to high school for three years and did not know what university the child finally went to, I thought that the effectiveness of accompanying him to study is questionable. It should be about the same whether he studies with him or not. , the three years of accompanying her were probably just an emotional make-up. When I heard that the couple in the small supermarket did not know the school and major their children were studying in, I was thinking that this seemed to be someone else’s business. The essence of university education is to pay for living expenses with your head covered. It is an education that is at a loss. invest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The day before yesterday, I called a water station downstairs and asked the store to send me a bucket of bottled water. The store responded that it could not be delivered, and there was no one in the store. The child was about to enter high school, and the wife went home to study with the child. If she wanted water, she would bring it herself. Originally, I could call another water station to have water delivered, but after the previous two experiences and my thinking, I immediately decided to go downstairs to carry water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I went to the water station and asked the shopkeeper: &quot;Why does your wife want to go home to study with you?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Then everyone is accompanying you, so it&#39;s impossible for us not to accompany you!&quot; the shopkeeper replied . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;What else can I do when I go back to study with me?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;What else can I do, cook, wash clothes, supervise my children not to play with mobile phones...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Like this Is it interesting to study with you?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The shop owner chuckled: &quot;We don&#39;t know about that... They say it&#39;s difficult to take the high school entrance examination now... I&#39;m afraid I won&#39;t be able to pass...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am not an educator myself , but I think there are some basic intellectual things that should be similar. I said to the shopkeeper, take the notes and I will tell you what time it is. I told him with my fingers: 1. Clarify your child&#39;s learning goals, which can be specific to which school he wants to attend, and understand the school&#39;s enrollment plan, enrollment requirements, and performance requirements. requirements and performance requirements as the program; 2. Maintain close contact with school teachers, understand the school’s learning progress and children’s learning situation, and solve possible learning problems in a timely manner. The basic problems should be grasped and the difficult problems should be overcome. ; 3. Your spouse should establish a good work and rest system, and supervise the child to balance work and rest during the learning process. When it is time to study and when it is time to rest, if you want the child not to play with mobile phones, first of all, she must not play with the mobile phone while the child is studying; 4. Don&#39;t use your emotional compensation as a moral standard to ask your children. Encourage your children to learn, but you must also respect your children&#39;s willingness to learn. 5. Caring for your children is long-term. It does not end when you enter high school in the future. Children are independent. However, your child&#39;s study and life are not independent. They are an expression of your family&#39;s common wishes and are closely related to your daily life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I finished speaking, and the shopkeeper also finished memorizing it, but he blinked, not knowing whether he understood or not. I told him that we would continue the discussion the next time I came to carry water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reading to your children is not just about doing laundry and cooking, nor is it as easy a job as sitting aside and playing with your mobile phone while asking your children to do homework and answer mock tests. What is the goal, what are the plans to achieve the goal, how to correct errors in the process of implementing the plan, how to achieve long-term emotional interaction after the plan is realized, how to make up for the failure of the plan, etc. These issues should be considered by the accompanying parents. of. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a fruit and vegetable shop downstairs. The proprietress of the fruit and vegetable shop also came back from school soon. I asked her: &quot;How did my child do in the exam?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She replied: &quot;I passed the exam. But the school is not very good, and the child has to repeat the year.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I asked: &quot;Will you no longer accompany me during the repeat year?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She said: &quot;I won&#39;t accompany you anymore. , I’ve had enough company, it’s up to him how he does in the next year’s exam, let him go!”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s dinner time, people in the industrial park and people upstairs all come upstairs It&#39;s time to eat and consume, and the merchants are busy again. Looking at them being busy, I think about the children behind them who are still studying. I don’t know which universities, high schools or other places of study those children are in. I just hope that they will be healthy in body and mind and make progress every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a practitioner in Shanghai fruit industry)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot; >;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The &quot;hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of Southern Weekend App is looking forward to your contributions.

The Chinese ancestors selected the &quot;beautiful stones&quot; from various stones. Jade is warm, shiny, meticulous and tough, so it is also considered by the Chinese to be benevolent and benevolent. Justice, wisdom, courage, and purity are the five moral qualities. Wearing jade has the effect of preventing evil spirits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Chinese ancestors’ understanding of jade can be traced back to the Neolithic Age. Humans ground stone tools as tools for chopping and scraping, hunting, and cutting meat. Some ground stone tools showed a smooth and beautiful appearance, and humans began to have a preliminary understanding of jade. This also marks the beginning of the transition of human beings from material needs to spiritual needs. Archaeological research has found that in the late Neolithic Age, many jade products and jade ornaments appeared. At this time, the ancients had realized that jade and stone had completely different functions and aesthetics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Around 3000 BC, jade craftsmanship was separated from stone tool processing technology and became an independent craft category. Based on the production traces left on the jades unearthed from the Hongshan Cultural Site and the Liangzhu Cultural Site, experts have inferred that a rotating jade processing tool - a weight machine - had appeared at that time. This is no different in principle from the jade processing machines we see now. The Shang and Zhou dynasties were the growth stage of Chinese jade art. The scope of use of jade expanded, and the number and types increased significantly. However, the shapes were still very simple, with only sporadic decorations. Hotan jade also appeared in this era for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period, the art of jade carving developed. At that time, scholar-bureaucrats wore a series of jade ornaments all over their bodies. What reflected the spirit of the times at that time were a large number of jade pendants in the shapes of dragons, phoenixes and tigers, with complex and beautiful shapes and strong Chinese style and national characteristics. The jade pieces of the Tang Dynasty are all treasures. The craftsmanship was further developed and refined. The texture is warm and the luster is soft. Gold and jade complement each other, making them rich and elegant. In the Song Dynasty, jade gradually entered people&#39;s lives. Influenced by calligraphy and painting at that time, the style became more realistic and full of life. During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, jade art reached its peak, and various types of exquisite jade articles emerged in endlessly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The definition of real jade and non-real jade has long been reflected in the system of jade use in Chinese history. Hotan jade is the highest level of jade, it is real jade, and is used by emperors. After countless years, Hotan jade has just entered the folk world. The one that caused the controversy this time was Hetian jade. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Facing Wang Hai’s doubts, Yuanyang Jinlou, the owner of the cargo in Li Jiaqi’s live broadcast room, posted the appraisal certificates, including the National Jewelry and Jade Quality Supervision and Inspection Center (NGTC), Guangdong Gold and Silver Jewelry Testing Center Co., Ltd., National Gold and Silver Products Quality Inspection and Testing Center (Nanjing) Organization, Shenzhen Zhongdi Jewelry Testing Co., Ltd. These institutions are not without authority. So, what is the problem? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first is the question of whether it is fake. According to Wang Hai, GB/T38821-2020 stipulates that the appraisal certificate must have total mass and physical photos, and consumers received 18 appraisal certificates attached to the necklace. Not only are each 40g, but they are also photos of a shared necklace. , then it is suspected of fraud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the problem of counterfeiting is easy to solve, but what is difficult to solve is the second level problem, which is the standard issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The standards used by these institutions are the national Hetian jade testing standards GB/T16552-2017 and GB/T16553-2017. This 2017 standard does not clearly stipulate the specific content of tremolite. As long as the main component is tremolite, it can be named &quot;Hetian Jade&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Hai adopts another standard, namely GB/T 38831-2020. The GB/T38821-2020 &quot;Hetian Jade Identification and Classification&quot; launched in 2020 was developed by the State Administration for Market Regulation and China Released by the National Standardization Administration Committee, it is the latest national standard for the Hetian jade industry. The mineral composition of Hetian jade is described as: &quot;Mainly composed of tremolite, the secondary mineral can be actinolite, and can contain a small amount of calcite, diopside, pyrite, pyrite, chromite, and magnetite. , quartz, serpentine, chlorite, epidote, wollastonite, apatite and garnet, etc.&quot; According to this standard, the naming rule is: when the percentage of other minerals in the same piece of jade is less than 5%, Hetian jade can be named directly. When the percentage of other minerals is more than 5% (except black jade), if the other minerals contained are evenly distributed and the boundaries of the mineral particles are clear, use &quot;tremolite jade&quot; with a note indicating that it contains other minerals. For example: tremolite jade (including tremolite jade) carbonates). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then, things are clear. Both standards are used in the industry. The 2017 standard is more relaxed, while the 2020 standard is more stringent. However, this standard is not mandatory and is only a recommended standard. Jade sellers adopted the loose standards introduced in 2017, saying that their items were Hetian jade; while Wang Hai, who fights against counterfeiters, adopted a stricter standard in 2020, saying that the jade sold by Li Jiaqi was fake and did not meet the standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Objectively speaking, jade has been difficult to identify clearly since ancient times. What exactly is jade? In fact, many people don&#39;t understand. When we talk about what a thing is, it is actually a chemical question. Chemistry is the study of the composition of matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a chemical perspective, jade is actually a mixture. When we talk about gold, we refer to the material composed of gold atoms; when we talk about quartz, we refer to silicon dioxide; when we talk about ice, we refer to dihydrogen monoxide. Of course, minerals are mixed with other impurities, but in an abstract sense, these things are composed of single atoms or single compound molecules. But jade, in an abstract sense, is a mixture. For example, just like when we talk about Chinese medicinal soup and borscht soup, even in an abstract sense, it must be a mixture of multiple ingredients. Therefore, jade is a mixture, which is a mixture of two or more compounds and elements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With this concept, it is easier to understand jade. Jade has different chemical compositions, different colors, and different types. The chemical composition of jadeite is sodium aluminum silicate, the most representative of which is jadeite. The chemical composition of nephrite is hydrous calcium magnesium silicate, the most representative of which is Hetian jade. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Specifically, Hetian jade has four main mineral components: silicon, aluminum, iron and magnesium. Silicon accounts for a large proportion of Hetian jade, and its main forms are calcium silicate (CaSiO&lt;sub>;3&lt;/sub>;), magnesium silicate (MgSiO&lt;sub>;3&lt;/sub>;), and sodium disilicate (Na&lt; sub>;2&lt;/sub>;Si&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>;O&lt;sub>;5&lt;/sub>;), etc.; the aluminum element is mainly albite (NaAlSi&lt;sub>;3&lt;/sub>;O&lt;sub>; 8&lt;/sub>;), and also contains a small amount of aluminum silicate; iron mainly exists in the form of potassium ferroaluminate and iron silicate. It can be seen that Hetian jade has many ingredients. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The charm of jade, its appeal to people in terms of look and feel, stems from this characteristic of jade&#39;s chemical composition. This has also caused various confusions in the naming, identification, and even price of jade. Some people say that the wholesale price of jade sold by Li Jiaqi is only a few dozen yuan. But then again, the wholesale price of tens of thousands of jade in those tourist attractions and jewelry stores may only be a few hundred yuan or less. This is the characteristic of the jade industry. As the old saying goes, &quot;Gold has a price, jade is priceless.&quot; This does not mean that gold is not as valuable as jade, and jade is a priceless treasure. It means that the price of jade has been confusing and confusing since ancient times, and the profits are often abnormally high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Jiaqi’s live broadcast room is said to have the lowest price on the entire Internet. Consumers believe it, but there is a gap between their expectations and reality. In fact, if you really want to buy cost-effective jade, the live broadcast room is not a good place. Only knowledgeable people with instruments can identify, and only with the ability to identify can we negotiate a good price. Obviously, most consumers cannot do this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 02 Nov 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[过度加工食物可能成瘾并严重影响健康]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259641]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-02 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/31/hEVw2oEow9miHUpCQ5S72i8Yf9OCyJ69RpVgzEp0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;717&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/hEVw2oEow9miHUpCQ5S72i8Yf9OCy J69RpVgzEp0. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256141&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Over-processing of food refers to industrial production and the addition of at least 5 or more ingredients, additives (usually sugar, stabilizers, preservatives, preservatives, pigments), etc., in this way Processed foods are called ultra-processed foods. Their purpose is to make them delicious and convenient, and more importantly, manufacturers can earn higher profits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Excessively processed foods include soft drinks such as cola, bread, cakes, potato chips, pizza, biscuits, candies, burgers, instant noodles, ice cream, spicy sticks, etc. More and more research results show that the intake of overly processed foods may be harmful to human health and increase the risk of various diseases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A recent study by Brazilian researchers suggests that overly processed foods may harm brain function. The reason is that overly processed foods contain many added and unhealthy ingredients such as sugar, salt, fat, artificial colors and preservatives. Past research has shown that overly processed foods are directly linked to an increased risk of heart disease, metabolic syndrome, and obesity, and now research is linking overly processed foods to a risk of decreased brain function. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The researchers collected data on nearly 11,000 men and women in Brazil with an average age of 52 who participated in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health. The researchers followed them for a long time, with a median follow-up time of 8 years. The results found that participants who consumed more than 20% of their daily calories from ultra-processed foods experienced a 28% faster decline in overall cognitive function and a 25% faster decline in executive function compared to adults over 59 years old. In other words, the decline in cognitive function and executive function is more obvious among adults aged 35-59. Overall, overall cognitive functions include learning ability and memory, while executive functions include language fluency and behavioral agility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the researchers admit that they cannot yet explain the mechanism by which excessively processed foods lead to reduced brain function, and there is no neuroimaging to confirm their results. Therefore, future research is to explore which overly processed foods lead to cognitive decline in the body and the molecular mechanisms behind it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One possible explanation, however, is that when people regularly consume overly processed foods, they are less likely to get the fiber, microbes, minerals, and plants they need to stay healthy, fight off disease, and reduce inflammation. Nutrients. Ultimately, this may affect a person&#39;s brain function and functioning, as the brain requires a steady supply of these nutrients to function properly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Overly processed foods have also been linked to cancer. Researchers from Imperial College London have found that high intakes of ultra-processed foods may increase an individual&#39;s risk of developing cancer and dying from cancer. Previously, a large number of studies have revealed that consuming large amounts of overly processed food will increase the incidence of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Now, British researchers have used the British Biobank to collect dietary information from 200,000 young people to study the relationship between body health and diet. This is the first such study to be conducted in the UK. The researchers monitored the people&#39;s health for 10 years, analyzing their risk of developing any cancer and 34 types of cancer, as well as the participants&#39; risk of dying from cancer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers conducted the most comprehensive assessment to date of the link between overly processed foods and people’s risk of developing cancer, including soda, industrially produced bread, and more. Ready-to-eat meals and most breakfast cereals. These foods often contain high levels of salt, sugar, fat, and artificial additives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The results show that people who eat a lot of overly processed foods are at a greater risk of developing cancer. Overly processed foods are particularly related to ovarian cancer and brain cancer. They also increase an individual&#39;s risk of death from cancer, most obviously. of ovarian and breast cancer. For every 10% increase in a person&#39;s intake of overly processed foods in a person&#39;s diet, the overall risk of cancer increases by 2%, and the risk of ovarian cancer in particular increases by 19%. It is associated with a 6% increase in overall cancer mortality, a 16% increase in the risk of death from breast cancer, and a 30% increase in the risk of death from ovarian cancer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The association between excessively processed food intake and cancer remained after adjusting for social, economic, behavioral and dietary factors such as smoking, physical activity and body mass index (BMI). Furthermore, previous research has shown that British adults and children consume the highest amounts of ultra-processed food in Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the study by British researchers cannot explain the causal relationship and mechanism between over-processed foods and cancer, they believe that existing research evidence shows that reducing the intake of over-processed foods in the daily diet may avoid Higher cancer rates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Overly processed food has become widespread around the world and is addictive. A research report published in the British Medical Journal on October 9, 2023 by researchers from the United States, Brazil, and Spain pointed out that an analysis of 281 studies in 36 different countries found that 14% of adults and adults worldwide 12% of children are addicted to over-processed foods, and 1/7 adults and 1/8 children may be addicted to over-processed foods. These foods include ice cream, carbonated drinks and convenience foods, which can lead to cancer, obesity and Increased risk of heart disease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the consumption of ultra-processed foods is soaring around the world, and now more than half of the daily energy intake in the UK comes from ultra-processed foods. In the United States, ultra-processed foods account for 58% of Americans’ energy intake. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fact that so many people eat over-processed foods suggests that they are addictive. Researchers explain the addiction to over-processed foods as higher levels of dopamine secretion may lead to over-processed foods. of addiction. Extracellular dopamine levels in the brain&#39;s striatum caused by refined carbohydrates or fats are similar to those of addictive substances such as nicotine and alcohol, thus creating a craving similar to alcoholism. Therefore, foods that contain high amounts of refined carbohydrates or added fats are likely to be addictive substances. The speed at which these overly processed foods deliver carbohydrates and fats to the intestines may also play a role in their addictive nature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Symptoms of addiction to over-processed foods include: strong desire to eat, withdrawal symptoms, difficulty controlling food intake, and obesity, overeating, poor physical and mental health, and reduced quality of life.

In 2014, the forum was upgraded from track two (private) to track one and a half (semi-official, semi-private). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Since then, military and political leaders and national leaders will appear every year, and the conference has been adjusted from once every two years to once a year.&quot; Zhao Xiaozhuo said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Farewell to online meetings during the epidemic, the 10th Beijing Xiangshan Forum attracted official delegations from more than 90 countries and international organizations including Russia, the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Iran, with more than 1,800 participants. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past 9 forums, there have been as many as 6 forums with the theme of &quot;Asia-Pacific&quot;. With the major changes in the nature of the forum, the scope of topics has also expanded from Asia-Pacific affairs to global issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Xinbo, Dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University, is a frequent visitor to the Beijing Xiangshan Forum. Since the first forum in 2006, he has attended the forum almost every year.

The United States first sent official representatives to the Beijing Xiangshan Forum in 2015. Four years later, in 2019, then-U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Shi Chande led a team to attend the meeting. It was the first time that a current senior U.S. military official appeared. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“In the early days, the U.S. delegation’s participation in the Beijing Xiangshan Forum was relatively low, and basically only the military attache from the embassy in China was sent to participate.” Wu Xinbo recalled that as the importance and influence of the forum increased, the United States began to start from domestic Send some mid-level delegations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Similar to the Shangri-La Summit and the Munich Security Conference, an official’s rank determines his stage. This is a common international practice.” Zhao Xiaozhuo said, “After lower-level officials arrive, they are often only responsible for collecting information.

On the evening of October 30, she appeared at a small seminar on &quot;China-U.S. Crisis Management&quot;, but did not speak. She only briefly communicated with the participants after the meeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, &quot;the level of the participants in the forum is not the most important matter. The communication between the two parties focuses on the substantive content.&quot; Wu Qian, spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense, pointed out at a press conference held before the opening of the forum. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;International Issues &quot;Desktop Collision&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At 15:00 on October 29, half an hour before the official start of the meeting, the conference room with less than 100 people was packed with people from all over the world. Representatives, experts and media, etc. This is a dialogue titled &quot;China&#39;s Role in Maintaining Asia-Pacific Security.&quot; Under the chairmanship of Wu Xinbo, experts from China, the United States, Russia and South Korea took their seats in turn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Why can the Asia-Pacific maintain stability for thirty years?&quot; The host first asked the question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fu Ying, a former Chinese diplomat, shared &quot;the reasons for the Asia-Pacific economic miracle&quot;: peace and stability, focus on regional cooperation and dialogue, and economic globalization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She gave data from the Bank of Asia, &quot;In the past 42 years, Asia&#39;s GDP has grown seven times. Nearly half of it was created by China.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And the United States&#39; GDP has grown seven times. Michael Swan, chief director of the East Asia Project at the Western Institute of National Affairs, believes that &quot;the change of power between China and the United States will bring huge uncertainty to Asia. In the next 10 to 15 years, the process of peace and stability in Asia may be disrupted.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shi Wen&#39;s view was refuted by Fu Ying: &quot;Today, China is the driving force of the development miracle in the Asia-Pacific region, and the United States has also benefited greatly from it, but now this has become a problem?&quot; Fu Ying said, The United States has launched a &quot;China-US trade war&quot; that has more gains than losses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Fu Ying refuted American scholar Shi Wen during the celebrity dialogue on October 29.

American scholar Shi Wen and Director of the Asian and African Studies Department of the Japanese Defense Research Institute Masuda Masayuki were criticized by Chinese scholars one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The Northeast Asian issue depends on the interaction of multinational relations between China, Japan, the United States, and South Korea.” Shi Wen said. He was the third speaker at this forum, and there were also scholars from China, Russia, South Korea and the UK. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shi Wen flicked the tablet on the armrest of his seat, trying to regard the North Korean nuclear issue and the Taiwan issue as the same type of regional conflict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Soon, the moderator of the sub-forum, Vice President of the China Institute of International Strategic Studies, and retired major general Du Nongyi made his point clear, &quot;The core of the Taiwan issue is China&#39;s sovereignty and territorial integrity. It has nothing to do with North Korea.&quot; Nuclear issues and other issues cannot be compared with each other.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the second half, Japanese scholar Masuda Masayuki became the target of public criticism because he blamed China for regional security problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Xuguang, senior adviser to the China Institute for International Strategic Studies, took the microphone and changed his original speech. He said that Masuda Masayuki was trying to teach the Chinese people &quot;a lesson&quot;. &quot;It is true that I am a little speechless.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Xuguang pointed out that the crux of the problem between China and Japan is rooted in Japan&#39;s psychological imbalance, trying to regard the Sino-US game as a &quot;rare opportunity&quot; to take action, and constantly pointing fingers at the Taiwan issue. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the rebuttal, Masuda Masayuki sat on the stage and smiled awkwardly. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Let developing countries have a voice&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the international public opinion field dominated by European and American countries, the voices of developing countries are rarely heard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Although it is a global village, every country has its own goals.&quot; At the &quot;Chinese and Foreign Young Officers and Scholars Seminar&quot; on October 29, Chief Executive Officer of the Pakistan Balochistan Research and Development Think Tank Official Jawariya Tareen said frankly. The young American scholar next to her had a serious expression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For more than seventy years, the India-Pakistan border issue has remained unresolved, and Kashmir has always been like a thorn in the relationship between the two countries. Jawariya mentioned that every time Pakistan wanted to have dialogue, India did not respond positively, and the relationship between the two sides only stopped at the think tank level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Developing countries face two major problems, one is development and the other is security.&quot; Lieutenant General He Lei of the Chinese Academy of Military Sciences told Southern Weekend reporters that in a sense, developing countries are the most important problems in today&#39;s world. The security demands of the &quot;vulnerable groups&quot; should receive more attention and reasonable concerns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the Beijing Xiangshan Forum, internationally renowned security forums include the Shangri-La Dialogue, the Halifax International Security Forum, the Munich Security Conference and the Seoul Defense Dialogue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;These forums have obvious &#39;circle&#39; attributes, and developing countries do not have much room to express themselves.&quot; Zhao Xiaozhuo mentioned that only the Beijing Xiangshan Forum clearly provides a stage for developing countries to fully express themselves safety concerns and demands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Representatives from various countries at the main venue (Photo by Lu Huiqian)&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/70713a9895. jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;645&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/70713a9895.jpg&quot; data-key= &quot;256575&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Main venue representatives of various countries.

The term was first used by American political activist Carl Oglesby as early as 1969. &quot;European and American countries are using the Global South to exclude China from developing countries and isolate China to the maximum extent.&quot; Zhao Xiaozhuo believes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;China occupies a very critical or even core position in the global South.

Wilde&#39;s work &quot;The Happy Prince&quot; left an indelible mark on him, and he knew: &quot;&#39;Good&#39; can no longer be limited to fulfilling social obligations.&quot; These realizations inspired Duan Yifu to think, and he was always exploring how to determine a person&#39;s position in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Duan Yifu mentioned some important historical figures in his narrative. Duan Maolan and his alumnus Zhou Enlai wrestled with each other&#39;s arms to test whether the other&#39;s injured arm was healed. Zhang Boling, the principal of Nankai Middle School, had a rare refrigerator and distributed trays of ice cubes to everyone. In order to keep them for him, his father used the folk remedy of spreading salt to delay melting. The adults are still thinking about how to treat their distant relative Wang Jingwei. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Duan Yifu has conflicting emotions about his father. He longs for love, but is disappointed by his father&#39;s preference for his brothers; he remembers the tenderness of the difficult times, but is also traumatized by his father&#39;s severity or anger. The most profound memory of my father is even just a childhood nightmare, and the scene in the dream has remained for many years:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; &quot;I opened my arms and wanted to hug him... What happened? But a ghost stood in front of me. It could be seen that it was my father, but he was covered in mourning clothes. This ghost was in the ever-changing airflow It was moving in the middle, weightless. It was an evil ghost, a corpse, with yellow light in its empty eyes.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The impression his mother left on him was warm and tough. , it’s a pity that she passed away prematurely. At the same time, Duan Yifu became increasingly sensitive due to his physical condition, and he became very ill for a time. He confessed his cowardice and unwillingness to participate in social change activities. Even in the face of racism and rude boys who treat him as a &quot;little girl,&quot; he has no motivation to actively fight back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The world in Duan Yifu&#39;s eyes is shrinking inward. When he was a child, he was exposed to all kinds of extraordinary events. When he grew up, the war ended and he had to face many personal problems. He summed up this growth experience as moving from the universe to the stove, and used beautiful writing to integrate life and academia. He quoted the words of the poet TS Eliot:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;All of us, in our lifetime, have heard and seen , why does everything you feel (a bird singing, a fish leaping, an old woman walking on a mountain road) be reproduced with emotion, but other things are not?&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/Tw2YMqSRtEFS7cvb8JlUSD8tgfDCDHTROGbmRzmD.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0 &quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;935&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/Tw2YMqSRtEFS7cvb8JlUSD8tgfDCDHTROGbmRzmD.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256474&quot;>;Youth Yifu Tuan. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the publisher)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Are you willing to be a lonely captain&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“Poetry can break through the barriers or boundaries of language logic.” Liu Su told Southern Weekend. He used this to describe the beautiful words written by Tuan Yifu. He translated &quot;Love Land Complex&quot; and &quot;Who Am I?&quot; &quot;Two books by Yifu Tuan, and I am currently translating &quot;The Divided World and Self&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he was a graduate student around 2010, Liu Su often suffered from having no books to read. Many times he was attracted by the ideas mentioned in the book, but could not find relevant Chinese or even English translations. He tried his best to find the original work, went to Douban to ask Douban friends who had read the book, and also went to the library, but he might only be able to make half a copy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I might as well translate it myself!&quot; Those experiences inspired Liu Su&#39;s enthusiasm. He thus embarked on the path of academic translation, and future college students will no longer face the dilemma of reading. At the same time, many scholars have also participated in the translation and introduction of geography classics. The Chinese translations of scholars such as Tuan Yifu and David Harvey are enough to be compiled into a collection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the summer of 2021, in the crowded Chongqing subway, Liu Su received a WeChat message from another translator Zhicheng, asking him if he was willing to translate &quot;Who Am I?&quot; 》. Even though the air conditioning was sufficient, he still broke out in a hot sweat: &quot;This book will finally be translated into Chinese!&quot; He had seriously considered that he was not willing to live a lonely life as a &quot;foreigner&quot; in a foreign country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Who am I?&quot; ” resonated with Liu Su’s heart. He experienced a long single life. When he got married, the children of his classmates were almost in junior high school. He may have experienced Duan Yifu&#39;s loneliness and his self-statement: &quot;I spent a lot of time in poems and essays about the sadness of spring and autumn, and spent them in places like libraries and coffee shops.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;Liu Su finished class, said goodbye to the students, and went to the library for a while after walking out of the teaching building. Even if I don’t write anything, I would still like to sit in the corner and experience what Yifu Duan said: “Living on campus almost all my life, surrounded by young people, makes me feel happy physically and mentally.” He sometimes goes to a nearby coffee shop and sits by the window, looking at the pedestrians, vehicles and street lights, feeling that loneliness is far away. The sensibility of exquisite language gathers together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yi-Fu Tuan in 1998, that is, &quot;Who Am I?&quot; &quot;The previous year&#39;s work &quot;Escapism&quot; asked: What is the greatest escape? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;When you lower your head and manage the environment around you with a heart that loves your neighbor, you can also look up at the vast starry sky.&quot; Liu Su talked about his understanding of this sentence and added a more realistic side, &quot;As a scholar, like him, I often look up at the starry sky of metaphysical thoughts and theories. However, whenever I look down at my single life, I often feel like I&#39;m in a mess.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/yuiWuAjVdL0ED9wFpbkVeQPFe5CYTThcg7YkL6fW.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2048&quot; height=&quot; 1536&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/yuiWuAjVdL0ED9wFpbkVeQPFe5CYTThcg7YkL6fW.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256475&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Duan Yifu (1930-2022), an internationally renowned Chinese geographer, was born in Tianjin and graduated from Oxford University. He returned to China in his later years. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the publisher)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Su is looking for descriptions of single life in books. Yifu Tuan made his apartment simple and warm, dressed modestly and appropriately, maintained good health and longevity, had good interpersonal relationships, and gained precious friendships. However, &quot;he once dreamed that he died alone at home, and no one found his rotting body.&quot; Duan Yifu always writes about his loneliness, a complicated feeling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Perhaps the reason is that loneliness is the most authentic way of human existence. The state of not being lonely is actually the product of escape.&quot; Liu Su quoted the saying of &quot;Escapism&quot;. There are three questions surrounding Yifu Duan&#39;s life: &quot;I am mortal&quot; that has lingered since childhood; &quot;Who am I&quot; related to individual consciousness; and &quot;What is a good life&quot;. Yifu Tuan wrote &quot;Geography saved me&quot;. Geography was like a road that led him to understand himself and the problems of human life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Translation of &quot;Who am I?&quot; &quot; also allowed Liu Su to gain &quot;a friendship worth cherishing.&quot; After the book launch, he, Zhi Cheng, editors and readers friends braved the heavy rain and went into a noodle shop to chat. Five people each signed five books and kept them. He also wanted to write his feelings into a longer email and share it with Duan Yifu. Before the email was finished, Duan Yifu passed away in August 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tuan Yifu published a new book that year, and finally wrote: &quot;I would like to advise you again, young traveler! You must be full of courage to operate your own ship like a captain, even though it is only Life&#39;s puzzling clues and stars serve as your guide.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Su was devastated by his mistake, but would continue to translate classics of humanistic geography. He also asked himself if he was willing to be a lonely captain and walk on a narrow road. No matter what the answer is, Tuan Yifu&#39;s book &quot;will always be projected into the heart of every reader.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Where is the real home&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Duan Yifu recalled in the preface of &quot;Going Home&quot; that people often asked him where he thought the real hometown was. . He answered lightly: &quot;In general, it&#39;s the earth.&quot; &quot;Where on earth is it?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then, the meaning of the question is probably: there must be a place where he is most comfortable, The most yearning, can form the deepest sense of belonging. &quot;Some specific landscapes do have great appeal to me, such as a landscape that transcends aesthetics - the desert. I feel that I am very close to the desert psychologically, and I can even regard it as my home.&quot; Yifu Duan again and again Once I wrote about my love for the desert. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beginning in the winter of 1954, Yifu Tuan was conducting field research for his doctoral thesis in southeastern Arizona. The research object was the desert terrain called the foothill erosion surface. When optimistic British student David Harris joins the group, the physical and spiritual hardships of the wilderness thin out and are gradually replaced by friendship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This relationship brings me satisfaction, but it also causes insecurity—almost all relationships of any depth involve both. Why? Is there something wrong with me? ?&quot; Duan Yifu asked in the book. In 1962, they collaborated again. He remained single and became a teacher; David married and had two daughters. &quot;The David today is a broader, more elusive personality than I knew before.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following description is sensitive and stinging, and such feelings appear repeatedly in the book . They each drove to Chaco Canyon to investigate, with Yifu Duan leading the way and David&#39;s family following behind. At dusk, maybe David knew the route, maybe the children needed care, David&#39;s car honked, kicked up dust and drove ahead. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;The distance between us became wider and wider, and soon, all that was left in front of my eyes was the raised The dust was gone, and in the end, even the dust was gone. I fell into a lonely shadow... When I tried to catch up with the Harris family, I felt lonely and painful for the first time. What&#39;s worse, I I even feel ridiculous. What on earth was I doing on a dirt road in New Mexico? Chasing a young family in a car?&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Yifu Tuan&#39;s eyes, friendship must meet two basic requirements: The conditions—like-mindedness and sympathy—should be balanced in an ideal friendship. &quot;If overly oriented toward shared interests and interests, these two people may become more like colleagues than friends; conversely, they may be more like lovers, staring into each other&#39;s eyes rather than into the world.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Shy people, unsociable people, or people like me who have their social needs suppressed by eccentric pursuits, perhaps should devote themselves to Nature...maybe only by staying in an inorganic environment, such as deserts and icebergs, can people feel relaxed and happy, and forget the good and the bad.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yi-fu Duan also wrote about the German Alexander von Humboldt. Humboldt was the founder of modern physical geography. He “made outstanding contributions to the development of geodesy and was the first to use painting and poetry to develop human geographical experience-feelings, emotions and concepts, which are the core of humanities. The starting point of socialist geography”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Humboldt lived to be 90 years old and was full of energy throughout his life. In his sixties, he could still travel through Siberia and Central Asia. He enjoys socializing, but has never been married, and has been trapped in emotional entanglements with men three times. He wrote in a letter to the married soldier Reinhard von Haften: &quot;Even if you reject me and look at me coldly, like a stain, I still want to be with you. ...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If I leave the universe, or to be precise, leave the harmony of nature and the joy brought by human beings&#39; ultimate achievements, my life will become miserable and I will not be able to survive.&quot; Yifu Duan listed He felt all kinds of human misery, &quot;But, I don&#39;t want to stay in those shadows for a long time...&quot; He believed in the light, the beauty of the universe, and the beauty and kindness of events. The next chapter is &quot;Geography Saved Me.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2005, taking the opportunity of attending an architectural conference, Yi-Fu Tuan returned to China after 60 years of absence and deliberately stayed for a while. He wrote a book called &quot;Going Home&quot;, which was translated into Chinese by Zhicheng. During the trip to Chongqing, he once again mentioned the nightmare that had plagued him throughout his life. When his father passed away in Taipei in 1980, he did not go back to see him for the last time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The end of the autobiography is the contrast between the dim light of the car lights and the vast darkness. That is not despair. Duan Yifu is still looking at himself. He asked the translator to attach his speech notes in 2012 as an updated understanding of &quot;who I am.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There are no so-called ordinary people in the world. The people you talk to every day are actually people with immortal souls... They joke with us, work together, and get married, but they are also ignored and exploited by us. All people are actually people with immortal souls. Among these people, some are immortal and terrifying, and some are immortal and brilliant.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Maybe it has been too long, he I really forgot&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Who am I?&quot; &quot;Yu Shiyi, the editor of &quot;WeChat,&quot; appeared somewhat silent - just like when communicating with text on WeChat - but soon opened up the situation, became talkative and humorous. His daily schedule was very regular and he even added a short period of time that day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later he added that he should not talk too much about his own story, and autobiographers should be given more space. So, this part is an extra chapter of this article. People are always faced with questions such as &quot;Who am I?&quot; The questions and answers constantly change with the situation, each covered with attractive colors. For example, the great director Bergman claimed that he knew less about himself than he did ten years ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yu Shiyi has unique feelings about discrete events. In early 1949, the Taiping shipwreck occurred in the waters west of Daishan Island where he was born. When he was a child, he had no idea about this tragedy. He only learned about it through documentaries when he left his hometown to attend college. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1950, approximately 125,000 young men, soldiers, and 25,000 civilian personnel and civilians moved to Taiwan from Zhoushan, later forming the first generation of Zhoushan people of 20,000 to 30,000 people. The initiators of Taiwan’s Veterans Return Movement in 1987 were Zhoushan people. Before the “Three Direct Links”, it was very difficult for them to contact their homeland. The local historical materials exhibition hall uses an entire wall to display letters forwarded by the Red Cross at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Islands shape cognition. Yu Shiyi left Zhoushan for Ningbo ten years ago, and then went to Shanghai to study. When I was growing up, there was no cross-sea bridge in Zhoushan. When a typhoon came, the island became an isolated island, physically and psychologically isolated from the rest of the world. Compared to county towns, provincial towns, and cities, visitors from small islands seem to be “small” and marginal. At first he longed to merge from the margins into the mainstream, but now he wants to have subjectivity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“As an immigrant, your regional identity is the first thing that is mentioned when you arrive in a new environment.” Yu Shiyi has a friend who was born in Hubei and grew up in Shenzhen, and later moved to Shanghai. He asked: What is the local accent of “other”? In 1973, 43-year-old Yifu Duan officially became a U.S. citizen. He has been living in the United States for nearly two decades, debugging himself as a &quot;cosmopolitan and a thinker writing about discrete subjects.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is also the little grandpa - my grandfather&#39;s younger brother - talking about the past during the Chinese New Year. He claimed that he once drove a simple diesel-powered boat from Qushan Island to Dongjiadu, Shanghai, in one night. Alone, without a GPS, all I have is experience and a compass. Yu Shiyi could not imagine the plight of the fishermen. Wouldn&#39;t they be scared if they were wandering around without land? He wrote down his boundless imagination in his notes:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The lanky man drove a small sampan from the island Set off and drive northwest, through night and day, to Dongjiadu. The lighting system at that time was not perfect, and there was no positioning system. Some waterways were almost dark at night, but he arrived at his destination safely without saying a word about the wind and waves he encountered. I think maybe too much time has passed and he has long forgotten the ups and downs along the way. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I remember that there is a famous lighthouse on Flower and Bird Island. I wonder if he passed by it. Under certain conditions, There will also be the wonder of the fluorescent sea. I always feel that the waterway from my hometown to Shanghai is full of mysterious powers. I once took a ferry from the island to Shanghai. I landed ashore at dusk and landed at dawn. That was the first time I saw the waves gurgling like spring water and seagulls soaring in the sky. Looking out from the small round glass of the third-class cabin, there are faint lights. Maybe I have seen the lighthouse of Flower and Bird Island. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I asked the tribesmen, have you gone ashore? He said he had unloaded the goods but did not go up. I was so sorry. I wanted to get the secrets of Shanghai in the 1980s from him, but he said, it’s nothing. The Bund is just across the Dongjia Ferry Road. I can’t understand those Western things. At that time, everything could be bought by ticket, and the people were people on the water. , naturally cannot be obtained. He drove the sampan up the Huangpu River and finally reached Jiangyin. This was undoubtedly an adventure. As for what to do there and how to get back to the island, he stopped talking without saying a few words. Maybe it&#39;s been too long and he really forgot. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Memories and narratives form fragments one after another, embedded in life. More than thirty years after my grandfather left Shanghai, Yu Shiyi also arrived in Shanghai. During the National Day holiday in 2022, he took a boat to the island with his father. The father was hesitant at first, after all, the house was no longer theirs. Many places are different. Old houses and new ones are popping up one after another. Fortunately, the road remains where it is. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yu Shiyi returned to the lane where he was born. The commercial house he bought more than 20 years ago was still there, but it was older. The back door was open, he went in and saw the washboard from many years ago. After all these years, it&#39;s still there, like a miracle. There was someone living nearby, and he was too embarrassed to disturb him, so he just wanted to go to the front door to take a look. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the resident saw the stranger, he became alert and asked: &quot;Who are you?&quot; Yu Shiyi was stunned, silent for a few seconds, and instinctively replied: &quot;This is my home.&quot; He walked to the front door and took a photo Teru then left. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;You have become the &#39;other&#39;.&quot; He recalled, &quot;There are physical things, and it used to be my home.&quot; He didn&#39;t know how many hands the house had changed. I felt relieved that I could finally say goodbye. For almost twenty years, he always thought of this home, worried about it, and was afraid it would be demolished. Now all the playmates and neighbors have left, leaving only photos and washboards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The recognition and memory of your hometown, in turn, become the means for others to identify you. Not long after being asked &quot;Who are you?&quot;, in December 2022, Yu Shiyi took over &quot;Who Am I?&quot; &quot;, the book will be launched at the Shanghai Book Fair in August 2023. The above is always a bit of an unexpected fate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 02 Nov 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[天安门下半旗悼念李克强同志]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259779]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-02 08:28:20&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/02/cJf35kinfSqDJ9neqoAwAKA7BWIEKjlN5UvkjG6D.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;667&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/02/cJf35kinfSqDJ9neqoAwAKA7BWIEKj lN5UvkjG6D. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;256604&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter Ju Huanzong&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;span>;On November 2, in memory of Comrade Li Keqiang, flags were flown at half-mast at Tiananmen Square in the capital. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 02 Nov 2023 08:55:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“吃得苦中苦，方为人上人”：是一种可鄙的价值观吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259580]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-02 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;There are many serious and serious rumors circulating on the Internet. Some are old and constantly updated versions, and some are new. of. A relatively recent one is: The Chinese student&#39;s thesis &quot;You have to endure hardships to become a superior person&quot;. As a result, the New Zealand professor gave a zero point and asked the soul question, &quot;Why should you become a superior person while others are inferior?&quot; What do people do? Why do you divide your compatriots into three, six or nine grades? Shouldn’t everyone be equal?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you do some Internet archeology, it is not difficult to find that this is A piece of Sanwu news concocted by a certain self-media, with no specific time, university or person. The motive of the fabricator is to use the words of foreigners who regard them as authoritative to show how low some Chinese people&#39;s words, deeds, and values ​​are, and how high their own preferred values ​​are. However, there are still many people who believe in this rumor that &quot;foreign monks like to chant sutras&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The original version of &quot;Only when you have to endure hardships can you become the best among people.&quot; The original version should be &quot;If you don&#39;t suffer the most hardships, you can become the best among people.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chapter 32 of &quot;Journey to the West&quot;. Tang Monk said: &quot;Disciples, be careful. If you encounter a high mountain ahead, you may be blocked by tigers and wolves.&quot; Sun Wukong said: &quot;Master, as a monk, don&#39;t talk at home. Do you remember the &quot;Heart Sutra&quot; written by Monk Wuchao, which says, &#39;If you have no worries, you will be free from worries.&#39; No fear, stay away from words that confuse dreams? But it is just to sweep away the dirt on the heart and wash the dirt on the ears. If you don&#39;t suffer in the suffering, it is difficult to be a good person. You should not worry, but there is an old man, even if the sky falls, you can Be safe. What are you afraid of?&quot; This was an education for the master. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also from &quot;Warning Words to the World&quot;, &quot;It&#39;s Hard to Meet Your Husband after Spring Falls in the Yutang&quot;. I saw a couplet hanging on the door: &quot;After ten years of suffering in front of the window, he became famous all over the world.&quot; &quot;This is the couplet written by my father-in-law. He passed the national examination and became a minister: Later, our father was When I study here, I will become a minister. I am studying here now, and I also want to climb the dragon and the phoenix to carry forward the ambitions of my predecessors.&quot; I also saw a couplet on the second door: &quot;If you don&#39;t suffer the hardships, it is difficult to become a master.&quot; The young master hurriedly returned. Study room...with my mind turned around and my determination to study diligently. This is a lot of self-motivation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The difference between the two versions is: &quot;Only when you endure hardships can you become the best among people.&quot; The first sentence is a necessary condition for the latter sentence; &quot;If you don&#39;t suffer the most hardships, you can become the best among people&quot; is the probability. Expression. The latter seems more rigorous and allows exceptions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What do you think of this kind of saying? If you take &quot;You must endure hardships to become the best&quot; as a full judgment, then it is not difficult to find counterexamples. In a logical sense, this proposition has been refuted. However, after that, everyone thought this was wrong and discarded it? Obviously not, everyone will just think you are making excuses, because this is not the correct way to open the proverb. The use of proverbs is inherently situational: only when specific preconditions are added or placed in a specific context can the proverb be established and can be used. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are a large number of sayings in various languages ​​with completely opposite meanings. Here is an example of Chinese: &quot;A powerful man cannot bend&quot; vs &quot;A man can bend and stretch&quot;; &quot;I will not offend others unless they attack me&quot; vs &quot;Strike first to gain strength, but to attack later will suffer&quot;; &quot;It is better to be broken into pieces than to be left intact&quot; vs &quot;to stay intact&quot; If the green mountains are there, you will not be afraid of running out of firewood&quot;; &quot;Take a step back and the sky will be brighter&quot; Vs &quot;The brave will win when you meet on a narrow road&quot;; &quot;To endure a moment of calm&quot; Vs &quot;It is tolerable, but what is intolerable&quot;; &quot;Everything is inferior, only reading is good&quot; Vs &quot; Three hundred and sixty lines, he will be the number one scholar&quot;; &quot;The blue is better than the blue&quot; vs &quot;The hair on the lips is weak, and the work is not solid&quot;; &quot;Three cobblers are better than Zhuge Liang&quot; vs &quot;Three monks have no water to drink&quot; ...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tell me, which sentence before and after is right, which sentence is wrong, or are they both wrong? In fact, as long as they are put into the appropriate context, these common sayings with opposite meanings can be used correctly. This is the correct way to use common sayings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Specifically, &quot;Only when you have to endure hardships can you become a superior person&quot; or &quot;If you don&#39;t suffer a lot of hardships, can you become a superior person&quot;, there are also common sayings with opposite meanings or different emphasis, such as &quot;One life. &quot;Second Movement and Three Feng Shui&quot;, &quot;Choice is more important than effort&quot;, &quot;Don&#39;t use tactical diligence to cover up strategic laziness&quot; and so on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In my opinion, success is determined by many innate and acquired factors. 1. Fate: when you were born in which country and family, this constitutes your initial conditions and boundary conditions; 2. Wisdom: intellectual endowment, the computing power and algorithm of the brain, which are also innate; 3. God: you Your knowledge system and values, as well as your vitality, motivation, courage and patience, have both innate and acquired components, but the acquired component is greater, because you can always choose your values ​​and choose to be a courageous person; 4. Luck: Factors you have no way of knowing or controlling because you are in a complex random system. In a specific process, &quot;god, wisdom, fate, luck&quot;, which factors are more important cannot be generalized. A person&#39;s success always resonates with the trend of history and personal destiny. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, among the many factors that determine success, hardship, diligence or patience are certainly important, especially for people without background. Other statements such as &quot;The sharp edge of a sword comes from sharpening, and the plum blossoms bloom from the bitter cold&quot;, &quot;There are roads in the mountains of books, and diligence is the path, and there is no limit to the sea of ​​learning, and the boat is made by hard work.&quot; Do they sound more pleasing to the ear? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What many people don’t like is “people superior to others”. This needs to be looked at twice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, from the perspective of rights or rules, of course everyone should be equal. No one is above anyone else, and no one is subordinate to anyone. It is against anyone&#39;s privileges or slavery. , which is the basic principle of civilized society. In this sense, there should be no &quot;people superior to others&quot; and &quot;people inferior to others&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, there are always certain professions that are more respected in society and have higher social evaluation or reputation. For example, professionals such as surgeons enjoy a higher social status and are not considered &quot;human beings&quot;. What about &quot;Master&quot;? Also, some people are respected and admired by everyone because of their ability, knowledge or virtue, and they even have many followers. For example, people like Xinxiang Xian are the core of society. If neighbors come to him to resolve disputes, does he count? What about &quot;people superior to people&quot;? In a company or organization, whether it has a strict hierarchy or a relatively &quot;flat&quot; management, there is a chain of command and a superior-subordinate relationship. The subordinates must obey the instructions of the superiors to do things. Can senior executives and superiors be considered &quot;superiors&quot;? &quot;Woolen cloth? In a nutshell, from the perspective of power or influence, elites or those with higher social status are often called &quot;dragons and phoenixes&quot;, and there is nothing wrong with being considered &quot;superior&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, if you want to be &quot;superior&quot; and pursue the privilege of overpowering others or trampling others under your feet, it is naturally a despicable value; What&#39;s the problem if you deepen your field, improve your talents and virtues, become popular, and gain a higher social status? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is the author&#39;s personal opinion only and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 02 Nov 2023 08:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[书城伏案的侧影：写在刘世南先生百年诞辰之际]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259765]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/01/gJOH0MA1fEMOll8Ren0VMWx1Krulso5uG3AasqhT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;916&quot; height=&quot;687&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/gJOH0MA1fEMOll8Ren0VMWx1Krulso5uG3Aasq hT. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256565&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Mr. Liu Shinan took a photo in front of the Chongshao Library of Jiangxi Normal University. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of Li Taosheng)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;People who long for friends who fear friends&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Liu Shinan Mr. (1923-2021) was a fighter. This is the first impression of him by people who are familiar with him and those who are not familiar with him. He dared to criticize various scholars, including those older than him, those of his generation, and those younger than him. His articles were scattered in various books and periodicals from the late 1970s to the new century, making readers People who feel the enthusiasm and persistence of his criticism are of course embarrassed by the critics, but they do learn from him, and many criticized scholars express their gratitude to him and respect him even more. His criticisms are actually aimed at problems, especially the style of study. His crisp and refreshing writing style contains a profound call for a sincere, simple, serious and down-to-earth style of study. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not many people know that he is very eager to be criticized. He criticized Mr. Liu Mengfu (&quot;Outside the Academic Hall&quot; page 301), and Mr. Mengfu also criticized him. He invited Mr. Mengfu to write a preface to his &quot;Da Luo Ju Shi Cun&quot;. Mr. Mengfu wrote a long preface in which he included his own critical opinions. He criticized it with real swords and guns. Mr. Shinan did not think that Sorry, let it remain in the preface as it is. This is the style of sincerity and magnanimity. He said in a letter to me on July 26, 2005: &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Mr. Liu Mengfu is in middle age and a poet. Learn the art of poetry and achieve the best of both worlds. He looks down upon him as a servant, looks down upon his followers, and is sincerely afraid of his friends. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He respects and looks forward to his &quot;fearful friends&quot;. When he heard Mr. Tao Wenpeng mention that some parts of his &quot;History of Qing Poetry Schools&quot; were a bit &quot;old&quot;, he wrote a letter asking Mr. Tao to point out his shortcomings in detail. Mr. Tao replied, and Mr. Shinan made a copy of the letter. Send me a copy and write:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Send me a copy of Mr. Tao Wenpeng’s letter, to be compared with Mr. Tao Wenpeng’s book review Although Mr. Yun and Mr. Tao made many mistakes in their compliments, Mr. Tao was able to correct their flaws. I hope Mr. Yun can do the same. In the past, Chen Si once said: &quot;The writings of the world cannot be without disease. I always have good people to ridicule my writings, and if there are bad ones, I should revise them in due course.&quot; He also quoted Ding Jingli and said: &quot;Who in future generations will know that my writings are evil?&quot; I hope that Mr. Zou Zhen, as the editor-in-chief of &quot;History of Qing Poetry Schools&quot;, will be able to rectify the shortcomings of my book and inform future generations of those who govern Qing poetry about what to avoid. This is the meaning of an academic public instrument. (January 12, 2005)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that he is still not satisfied with Mr. Tao&#39;s criticism and hopes to get more and more real criticism. He regards criticism as an &quot;academic official tool&quot;. &quot;To look at it. This allows us to understand more clearly that the reason why he carried out academic criticism with all his might was because he really had no selfish motives and was only dedicated to the healthy and mature development of the academic world. His attitude towards criticism is not only aimed at others, but also aimed at himself, which is conducive to his own improvement and is conducive to clear understanding in the academic community. He sets an example and has a bright mind, which is admirable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/A2lmlAB2WbWNF9rofeqfKqiPLtvwopiAQGhCByuu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height= &quot;866&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/A2lmlAB2WbWNF9rofeqfKqiPLtvwopiAQGhCByuu.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256567&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Professor Liu Shinan and his &quot;Detailed Notes on Three Hundred Qing Poems&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He was very moved by others&#39; corrections to him and expressed his gratitude repeatedly. Our publisher was planning to launch chronological anthologies one after another. Considering that Mr. Shinan was familiar with Qing literature, editor and editor Zhou Xuanlong, then director of the Classics Department, sincerely invited him to annotate &quot;Selected Works of the Qing Dynasty&quot;. Considering that time was tight, he asked his Student Professor Liu Songlai assisted. After the manuscript arrived, Ms. Wen Lichen, a graduate student at Beijing Normal University, intern, reviewed it for the first time under my guidance. Then I reviewed it again. After writing two revisions, I sent it to Mr. Shinan for review. He said in a letter written in the Provincial Library on October 1, 2005:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;September 22 and Review comments and copies of book reviews have been received. Please read them. After reading it, I feel ashamed and excited! &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the articles of Kuangzheng and Supplement, we can also see that Mr. Wen Lichen and Wen Lichen have made profound achievements in the study of female history, and their admiration for them cannot be overstated! I secretly say that the &quot;Selected Works of the Qing Dynasty&quot; will be of some benefit to this world in the future. It shows that the cooperation between the four of us is not caused by Song Lai and me. I plan to add a few words to the preface of this book to clarify the meaning and to show that we do not dare to take advantage of beauty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He later insisted on adding words of praise to me and Xiaowen in the preface of the book, which shows that he was happy after hearing about it and had an open-minded and sage mind, which was like a spring breeze. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/9ICJwEasJaiGQCkwpKLheTnuNb0kMpOpfGgmCBxe.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height= &quot;774&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/9ICJwEasJaiGQCkwpKLheTnuNb0kMpOpfGgmCBxe.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256566&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Professor Liu Shinan’s two works. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;A silverfish in the book of life and death&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Mr. Shinan&#39;s fighting spirit is mainly reflected in his diligent reading and writing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He does not have many books, mainly because the collections of two generations of his were destroyed during the special period, which made him extremely sad, and he generally stopped buying books (&quot;Odd Records of Masters and Friends&quot;, page 117). He mainly visits the library. He is a frequent visitor to the provincial library and school library. In 1994, after fourteen years of arduous reading, research, and writing, he finally completed &quot;History of the Qing Poetry School&quot;.

The editor, during the editing process, greeted him and mentioned this impressive scene. He wrote me a reply in the sample library on the evening of December 30, 2003 and the next day:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Thank you for your attention.

One New Year&#39;s Eve, the curator and he &quot;faced each other from a distance&quot;, which was quite a scene. He wrote to his student Professor Guo Dan: &quot;It is now nearly 4 o&#39;clock in the afternoon on New Year&#39;s Eve. Director Zhang and I are the only two people left in the library reading hall; Director Zhang is on duty in person and will accompany me until 4 o&#39;clock with a smile. The bell closes the door.&quot; (Guo Dan&#39;s &quot;The Realm of Scholarship and the Style of Personality - A Note on Mr. Liu Shinan&quot;, &quot;Occasions of Teachers and Friends&quot;, page 237) Such a curator is really a good curator, and such a reader is really a good reader. This is called It is a good story in the contemporary reading world.

Later, when there was no urgent work, I still went to the library unremittingly. In the past, revolutionaries had a heroic saying: &quot;Sit through the prison.&quot; Mr. Shinan, in his old age, still insisted on going there regardless of his illness. He really had the spirit to penetrate the library. The letter dated January 10, 2013 said:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;One ​​year has passed and I was recently hospitalized for removal of nasal warts. Medical advice It was basal cell carcinoma and had been completely removed. I am already ninety years old and have lived and died for a long time, so after I was discharged from the hospital, I still sat in the library. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Professor Guo Dan called Mr. Shinan to wish him a happy New Year on the morning of the first day of the Spring Festival in Year Yiwei in 2015, the answer he heard was &quot;I am already reading in the provincial library&quot;! (Postscript to the reprint of &quot;Occasions of Teachers and Friends&quot;) Mr. Li Taosheng has been accompanying Mr. Shinan for many years. He said in the article &quot;Unforgettable words from the bottom of my heart&quot;: &quot;Books are all his spiritual sustenance.&quot; &quot;No matter the wind, frost, rain or snow, he always He would always show up at the library on time like a staff member. He said he hoped he could die at his desk in the future.&quot; (&quot;Occasions of Teachers and Friends&quot;, page 249) This shows how obsessed he is with books. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;From thousands of books&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Mr. Shinan has read extensively and is particularly familiar with classics and history, so he can read many treatises We are sensitive to misunderstandings, misjudgments, and corrections and can provide corrections. In addition to helping others publish absurdities, he mainly devoted his energy to the research and writing of &quot;History of Qing Poetry Schools&quot;. In addition, a lot of study was done on the annotations of &quot;Selected Works of the Qing Dynasty&quot;. After taking on this task, he devoted himself wholeheartedly to the selection of articles. Although Professor Song Lai was invited to participate in the annotation work, he still did everything personally:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From text selection to punctuation to the comments, I will read them all and revise them. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;At these times, I was busy selecting articles, mainly from &quot;Sikuquanshu&quot; and &quot;Continued&quot; Choose from &quot;Xiu Siku Quanshu&quot; and &quot;Cunmu Series&quot;, and a few have to be found separately from the thread-bound library. For example, Jiang Shiquan has no text in &quot;Continued Cultivation&quot;, but &quot;Pictures of Night Classes with Sound Machines&quot; must be selected. Others can be deduced by analogy. The selection of the text is time-consuming. After selecting it, it must be photocopied and then hand-copied into simplified Chinese characters. (December 16, 2003) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to concentrate on the work of &quot;Selected Works of the Qing Dynasty&quot;, he served as the chief academic consultant for the compilation of &quot;Yu Zhang Series&quot; in Jiangxi Province universities for several years. (that is, final check) also resigned. This shows his determination to devote himself wholeheartedly to the work of &quot;Selected Works of the Qing Dynasty&quot;. Because he was familiar with the collected works of the Qing Dynasty, and he read them day and night, by December 30, 2003, he had &quot;read page by page the Qing Dynasty Collection of Continuing the Complete Collection of Siku Quanshu&quot;, and had reached 154 of the 188 volumes. , there are still 30 volumes left, I can finish them before the winter vacation,&quot; and said, &quot;Then I will read &quot;Sikuquanshu&quot;, there are not many collections. I haven&#39;t read &quot;Cunmu&quot;, so I don&#39;t know how many.&quot; In selecting articles, &quot;Be sure not to show off your hands and eyes, and don&#39;t be attracted by people&#39;s enthusiasm&quot; (letter dated December 30, 2003). In this letter, he still could not hide his critical eye and expressed his opinions on several books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I was reading the collected works of Zeng Guofan today, and I found four books that were annotated by modern people. Take &quot;Yuancai&quot; as an example , Tu Xiaoma&#39;s version, Lai Xinxia&#39;s version, and Guo Yuheng&#39;s version all concluded: &quot;Is it possible to say that it is not false?&quot; &quot;Is it possible to say that it is not false?&quot; On the contrary, Zheng Zhenduo&#39;s &quot;Late Qing Dynasty&quot; &quot;Selected Works&quot; concluded: &quot;Is it true to say that the accusation is not false?&quot; That&#39;s right. Tu, Lai and Guo... I don&#39;t know that the &quot;ye&quot; in &quot;Ke Hu Ye&quot; is actually &quot;ye&quot;. Books such as &quot;Jing Zhuan Shi Ci&quot; make it very clear, and the ancient prose written by Han Yu and Ouyang Xiu is swaying and often colorful. There is this aria. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the &quot;king&quot; in &quot;Everyone is king and is ordered to do so&quot; has been misunderstood. &quot;Mistakenly changed to &quot;must&quot;, it is also analyzed. He did not deny your contribution, he just wanted to explain that he would learn from their achievements, but would never simply plagiarize:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;Even if we refer to this kind of annotated version, we must analyze every detail, never make vague and influential remarks, but strive to be clear and accurate. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are actually very few similar works that we can rely on. Even if we refer to them, they must be adopted with discernment. This is in line with what Mr. Shinan has always advocated: &quot;Speak from the heart, never tamper with a single word.&quot; academic spirit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By June 26, 2004, it was the final stage of &quot;Selected Works of the Qing Dynasty&quot;. He wrote to me to introduce the writing situation of the preface of the book:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot; font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The preface can prove that the two of us have a slightly new understanding of Qingwen and do not follow what others say, precisely because we have put a lot of effort into the annotation of the works. For example, &quot;the genre is single but the styles are diverse&quot;, we not only pointed out &quot;how it is&quot; but also explained &quot;why it is so&quot;. This is the characteristic of our learning. It is also aimed at traditional Chinese literary criticism. The traditional method is improvisational and perceptive, and only points out &quot;how it is&quot; without analyzing &quot;why it is so&quot;. We have accepted the influence of Western academics and always like to pursue a &quot;why&quot;. Therefore, with regard to the emergence of the Tongcheng School (including the later Yanghu School and the Xiangxiang School) and the praise of &quot;all the articles in the world can only be found in Tongcheng&quot;, we try to find out its logical inevitability through this phenomenon. There are always laws to follow in phenomena, among which the law of cause and effect is most worth pondering, and the results of pondering are also the most thought-provoking. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Tao Wenpeng heard about this preface and immediately asked Mr. Shinan to publish it in &quot;Literary Heritage&quot; in advance. Mr. Shinan said in his letter on January 12, 2005:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Tao Jun asked to rewrite the preface of &quot;Selected Works of the Qing Dynasty&quot; For the thesis, I have cooperated with Song Laijun. However, Huamei may not be fashionable and Zhu Yi may not nod. But I can be confident that the words and sentences of these two people come from their hearts and come from thousands of books. There is no suppression or similarity. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The confidence reflected here comes from his steady reading and long-term cultivation. This spirit is reflected in his works and critical articles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The method of popularizing culture through book selection is traditional, but it is an effective method of cultural communication for thousands of years. However, few people are willing to take on such work now because it requires Investing a lot of energy requires a high level of appreciation, extensive knowledge reserves and profound cultural heritage. The art of annotation is extremely difficult to learn, and it can easily lead to mistakes. However, Mr. Shinan resolutely agreed to do the work of &quot;Selected Works of the Qing Dynasty&quot;, which shows his confidence and responsibility. After the publication of this book, readers responded very well. Mr. Shinan was very happy and wrote a letter saying:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What will your company do next year?

In addition to &quot;History of Qing Poetry Schools&quot; and &quot;Daluoju Poetry and Essays&quot;, Mr. Shinan also has &quot;Outside the Academic Hall&quot; revised and reprinted, and &quot;Occasional Notes of Teachers and Friends&quot;. These two books are not &quot;pure&quot; books. , the collection is relatively mixed, the form is very random, but the theme is clear, they are all academic texts, and they are all &quot;dry information&quot;. It preserves a large number of academic correspondence, collects some book reviews, talks about academic methods, and more importantly, the academic spirit. It is interesting. We also collected some opinions that differed from those of Mr. Shinan. He said in the preface of &quot;Occasions of Teachers and Friends&quot;: &quot;&#39;The dispute is between gentlemen&#39;, and it is by no means a dispute of will. For me, it is &#39;I love my teacher, and I especially love the truth.&#39;&quot; He once again praised Mr. Mengfu, Praise him as a &quot;critical friend&quot; and &quot;admire his courage to stick to the truth.&quot; Regarding this book with the theme of &quot;I and the Intellectuals I Understand&quot;, Mr. Shinan said: &quot;The nature of this book is similar to &quot;The Inheritance of Sinology Teachers in the Kingdom of China&quot;. It is academic and can be used as a modern and contemporary book. Materials on academic history and intellectual history.&quot; Indeed, its content is more than an independent paper. It contains rich materials for contemporary scholars&#39; ideological exchanges and even confrontations. It has great academic value and is undoubtedly a breakthrough in form. and pioneering. The letter dated July 18, 2004 stated:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You will feel that this is a picture of the times, which reflects the The vigorous fighting of the soul. It can leave a valuable legacy to future generations and let them know how intellectuals in our era are searching. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;External Edition&quot; of this book includes an article &quot;How do contemporary intellectuals inherit and carry forward the fine traditions of ancient Chinese scholars?&quot; &quot;&quot; embodies his exploration on the ideological and spiritual level, letting people know that he is not a nerd, and his active mind and body surpass many young people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In academic research, he has direct and in-depth discussions. In terms of poetry creation, it also has profound meaning and is worth appreciating. On January 12, 2005, he wrote a letter to talk about his &quot;Da Luo Ju Shi Cun&quot;:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Mr. , you will know that the humble poems are not works criticizing the wind and the moon, but are all words of crying and sighing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said in the preface to &quot;Shi Cun&quot;: &quot;Any poem must be written for a purpose. It will never lament the old age and humbleness, but only the worries of the people, the country and the world.&quot; Many of his poems directly record reality, which makes people sigh and impress him with his broad mind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I felt that it took Mr. Yu fourteen years to write &quot;History of Qing Poetry Schools&quot;. After the book was edited and published, I wrote a book review and published it in &quot;Hainan Daily&quot;, which was later revised and published. In Guangming Daily. I sent it to Mr. Wang for review. He said in the letter dated June 4, 2004:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;is busy working on &quot;Selected Works of the Qing Dynasty&quot; , I usually put the letter aside and reply later. I didn’t expect to receive your letter today, let alone read your book review. After reading the book review carefully, I burst into tears. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You may be wondering: Why am I so easily excited? There are about seven or eight book reviews about &quot;History of Qing Poetry Schools&quot;, but I have never been so excited. As for you, as the editor-in-chief, you obviously read &quot;History of Qing Poetry School&quot; carefully, so you also carefully read &quot;Outside the Academic Palace&quot;. In addition, you have superb appreciation, rich life experience, and correct ideological understanding. , can I write such a book review that makes me excited. The masterpiece is not long, but it all hits the point, especially the point of humanistic care, which only you dare to point out. Frankly speaking, when I wrote &quot;History of Qing Poetry Schools&quot;, I really had the mentality of Confucius writing &quot;Spring and Autumn&quot; and Ma Qian writing &quot;Historical Records&quot;. This point was only pointed out in a book review by Professor Wang Qizhen of our school, but the article seems not to have been published yet. But you coincide with Mr. Wang, which is the most gratifying thing for me. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Mr. Yunbo, please let me say a word of sincere gratitude: &quot;Uncle Bao, you know how to take care of me. I am proud that Yu Qing will not be a guest.&quot; This is a couplet made up at random, all using &quot;Historical Records&quot;, and I feel it is very relevant. Some people may question: How can people deal with things? Then I have to say it without any shame: Just consider yourself dead. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My husband affirmed the book review I wrote. I have this confidence, but I never expected that it would make him &quot;cry with emotion&quot; and write &quot;Uncle Bao knows how to manage&quot; and so on. words of thanks; he directly confided his ambitions and pursuits, which shows that he didn&#39;t take anything for granted. In 2011, he recorded a super-star academic video, talking about &quot;Me and the History of the Qing Poetry School&quot; (later included in &quot;Occasional Notes of Teachers and Friends&quot;), and mentioned that &quot;Mr. Ge Yunbo is really my close friend.&quot; All of this moved me very much, and made me feel the power of the seniors to inspire the younger generations. It also made me feel the glory of being a down-to-earth editor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above experiences have undoubtedly increased our closeness. When our family went to Nanchang for the first time to visit Mr. Shinan on October 6, 2018, the host and guest were delighted. He held my hand forcefully and held on for a long time. It was not like the hand of a 96-year-old man at all. He can support himself. He also often goes to the library. We all believe that he can easily survive his old age. We look forward to visiting him again. But unexpectedly, I received a text message from Professor Song Lai on August 2, 2021, and learned that Mr. Shinan passed away the night before. I originally wanted to write a sentimental article after learning from the pain, but I was burdened with publishing projects and was unable to do so. This year marks the 100th anniversary of Mr. Shinan&#39;s birth. I made up my mind to write a brief statement of my admiration and gratitude for him, so I came up with the above immature commemorative text. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 23:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[娄底7岁女孩遭性霸凌疑云：到底是夸大其词还是轻描淡写？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259761]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a netizen in Loudi, Hunan claimed that his 7-year-old daughter was raped by more than a dozen female classmates in her class during lunch break at school. Bullying and even injuries to the private parts have attracted great attention on the Internet. The local report stated that an investigation confirmed that a female student was involved in a brief brawl, but no intentional harm was found. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 28, a parent from Loudi, Hunan Province posted on social media, saying that his 7-year-old daughter was studying in the second grade of a primary school in a township in Loudi, Hunan Province. During lunch break on October 20, she was raped by 16 or 17 girls in her class. The classmates bullied her on the playground. These female classmates not only beat her daughter, but also sexually bullied her, causing injuries to her lower body and causing unbearable pain. Both the school and the parents of the bullying students have a negative attitude toward solving the problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Little girls in the second grade collectively bullied their female classmates, especially sexual bullying, which was appalling. People can&#39;t help but think of the sexual bullying incident of a 9-year-old primary school student in a bilingual school in Datong, Shanxi that came to light a few months ago. Therefore, the incident quickly became a hot spot on the Internet and attracted great attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 30, Lengshuijiang City (a county-level city under the jurisdiction of Loudi City), where the incident occurred, issued a situation statement in the name of a joint investigation team, saying that after discovering the relevant videos, the Municipal Education Bureau immediately established a , the Public Security Bureau and other departments. After preliminary investigation by the public security department, it was found that the girl involved Zhang and six other female classmates were classmates in the second grade of a primary school in the city; at noon on October 20, because of an incident while skipping rope on the playground There was a dispute and &quot;mutual fighting&quot; occurred for about 1 minute, during which Zhang was &quot;briefly surrounded and slapped&quot; by several other classmates; after monitoring and monitoring was obtained, the girl involved was questioned &quot;protectively&quot;, and the witnessing teachers and students were investigated, but no evidence was found. Intentional injury. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The characterization of the incident in this official report is completely different from the accusation made by the victim’s mother. The description of the incident process is also vague and unclear, and there is no clarification on the key issues of the accusation. If the official has sufficient evidence that the girl&#39;s parents are exaggerating, they should publicly refute the evidence. Otherwise, not only will it fail to eliminate public doubts, but it will arouse greater doubts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first question is whether the girl Zhang’s lower body was injured. According to information released by Zhang&#39;s mother, Zhang had multiple soft tissue injuries on his body and his lower body was also injured. He was in unbearable pain when urinating and was forced to hold in his urine. However, although the official report confirmed that &quot;mutual fighting&quot; occurred, it did not mention whether Zhang was injured. This is also the aspect that attracts the most attention from netizens and makes people the most angry. Officials should not shy away from this, they should investigate this and make the results public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If Zhang’s lower body is indeed injured, then this is a very serious violation of minors. The cause of the injury must be found out. If it involves criminal behavior, he must be severely punished. If Zhang was not injured, then enough credible evidence must be produced to refute the accusations made by the girl’s parents. For example, Zhang can be taken to a tertiary hospital outside Loudi City for examination accompanied by his parents, and the examination results can be announced. If Zhang’s mother exaggerates or lies, she should not avoid it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, it is necessary to release the relevant video of the incident that occurred on the playground to set the record straight. Zhang’s mother said that Zhang was beaten by 16 or 17 girls in his class on the playground. The official statement stated that except for Zhang, only six students were involved in the incident, and that several girls were &quot;fighting with each other&quot; for only about a minute, while Zhang was only &quot;briefly surrounded&quot; and &quot;swatted&quot; by several classmates. According to the two sides, not only the number of participants is hugely different, but there is also a huge difference in nature between &quot;beating&quot; and &quot;fighting with each other.&quot; Since the official statement mentioned that the police obtained the school&#39;s surveillance video, it means that the incident was recorded, and it was not the &quot;aging surveillance&quot; mentioned by the school in Zhang&#39;s mother&#39;s post. Since there is a video, it should be made public in its entirety so that the public can judge for themselves whether it was a &quot;beating&quot; or a &quot;fighting&quot;, how long it lasted, and whether there was any &quot;intentional harm.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, for the sake of protecting minors, minors who can be identified in the video can be treated with protective techniques, such as mosaic, blurred faces, etc., but it should be ensured that several minors can be seen. The individual&#39;s involvement in the incident, and the extent of the &quot;ruffling&quot; involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It seems a bit incredible that a 7-year-old girl would bully her classmates and also be sexually involved. But it&#39;s not impossible. In a bullying incident at a bilingual school in Datong, Shanxi, the bully was only 9 years old. This was not the first time that bullying had occurred, it had also started in the second grade. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a stereotype that bullies in school are boys. In fact, this is not the case. Among school violence incidents, the proportion of women committing violence is not low. In March 2023, a bullying incident broke out in Hainan in which a 13-year-old girl was beaten and humiliated by a group of same-sex peers. When the Datong incident attracted great attention, criminal law teacher Cai also received news that a female classmate was bullied by other female classmates in the dormitory, and also engaged in sexual behavior, and the perpetrator even took a video. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early years, CCTV reported on a study and found that more than 80% of the perpetrators of school bullying videos posted on the Internet were women. Of course, this may be related to the fact that female bullies are more likely to take videos and upload them online to humiliate their victims, but it also shows that female perpetrators of school violence are by no means uncommon. Moreover, among the campus bullying committed by women, many of them are a group of people bullying one person, and the targets of their bullying are mostly women. Also, among the bullying committed by women, a high proportion involves sexual humiliation, such as being forced to strip naked and take photos. This may be because it creates a stronger sense of shame for the victim. These characteristics of female bullying are consistent with the accusations made by the mother of the victim in the Loudi incident that more than a dozen girls beat and sexually bullied her daughter. This is one of the reasons why netizens are more willing to believe victims’ accusations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This matter has attracted great attention on the Internet, and the official understatement of the situation is obviously difficult to convince the public. This reminds one of the sexual bullying incident at a bilingual school in Datong, Shanxi. The school and the authorities tried to turn the incident into a minor matter, but in the end, the bullying incident was confirmed. The same is true for this suspected bullying incident in Loudi. If the authorities have sufficient evidence to support their account of the situation, they should make it public promptly to refute the accusations made by the girl&#39;s parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
