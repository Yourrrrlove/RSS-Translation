While there was still a glimmer of light, she planned to go to the observation point of her choice, where she expected to see chimpanzees building their nests. Suddenly, she heard the cry of chimpanzees, and four chimpanzees appeared in the telescope, eating a yellow fruit similar to plums. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She decided to get closer to them. When she cautiously approached the big tree, she found that the branches were empty—the chimpanzees had slipped away again. This situation had happened countless times for more than half a year, and she felt an almost numb despair. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, when her eyes moved down, she found that two adult chimpanzees were sitting on the ground less than twenty meters away from her, watching her. After a few seconds, they began to stroke each other&#39;s fur as if no one else was watching. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This was truly one of the most exciting moments I have ever had the pleasure to experience in my life.” Jane Goodall wrote in the book “The Chimp Is Calling” that she finally got to see her up close. Watch the chimpanzees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 17, 2023, the documentary &quot;The Legendary Life of Jane Goodall&quot;, starring the 89-year-old British biologist Jane Goodall, was released in China. The film won the 71st Nominated for Best Documentary at the British Academy Film Awards, it has a Douban score of 9.2. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since childhood, Jane Goodall has had a strong interest in animals. When she was one year old, her family bought her a toy chimpanzee, which became her cutest friend; when she was 4 years old, she stayed in the chicken coop for five hours just to observe how the hens lay eggs; when she just turned 8, she Make up your mind to go to Africa when you grow up and be with wild animals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an adult, when a friend invited her to visit a farm in Kenya, she did not hesitate to quit her job and returned to her hometown to work as a waitress for a period of time to save money for her trip to Africa. &quot;I never expected to get married or start a family. That was not within my scope of consideration. Going to Africa to live with animals was the only thing I wanted to do.&quot; Jane Goodall said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/HpRcTJ1jNuZIbTwW9gO4uEWrTfojng2am9fYIoA6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;536&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/HpRcTJ1jNuZIbTwW9gO4uEWrTfojng2am9fYIoA6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255551&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Jane fell in love and got married to wildlife photographer Hugo. Later, the two chose to separate for their respective careers. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;The strange feeling of isolation&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p >;When she first arrived in Africa, someone told Jane Goodall that if she liked animals, she must visit Louis Leakey, the then director of the National Museum of Kenya. Jane Goodall followed the advice and later became Louis Leakey&#39;s secretarial assistant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1957, Louis Leakey applied for a six-month grant to study wild chimpanzees. In his view, studying the behavior of great apes is helpful in understanding the behavioral characteristics of human beings&#39; ancient ancestors. He wanted to find a researcher who could conduct fieldwork, uninfluenced by scientific theory, and unbiased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secretary Jane Goodall fits this requirement. Before going to Gombe to study chimpanzees in 1960, she had no academic training, no science degree, and even no knowledge of wild chimpanzees. However, she loved animals, was patient, and had a great passion for knowledge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the book &quot;Chimpanzees Are Calling&quot;, Jane Goodall recalled that when she first saw the endless forest in Gombe, her mother who accompanied her was afraid, and she herself All I could think about was “the strange feeling of being isolated from the world.” However, for a young woman, approaching chimpanzees and trying to be accepted into the group was unimaginable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She could only hope that the chimpanzees would get used to her and ignore her presence. The rhythm of her life in Gombe is very fixed. No matter what the weather is like, she always goes to the mountains early in the morning to observe chimpanzees - walking through layers of trees, wading through streams, climbing steep slopes, arriving at a suitable observation point, and raising the telescope in her hand. Sometimes she could see a group of chimpanzees swinging from a fig tree, and sometimes not at all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And every time she tried to get a little closer, the chimpanzee would run away. &quot;That was probably when I was most depressed.&quot; Jane Goodall said. Even more frightening is that sometimes, chimpanzees can become aggressive when facing strangers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an interview with the New York Times, Jane Goodall recalled that the chimpanzees would sometimes climb up the tree screaming, their hair standing on end, shaking the branches vigorously, and hitting her on the head with branches. At this time, she could only pretend to be calm, not look at them, dig some small holes in the ground and eat some leaves. After the chimp left, her legs began to tremble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, after several months of observation, the chimpanzees gradually got used to her presence and accepted her. The closer she got to chimpanzees, the more Jane Goodall discovered that they are so similar to humans. They also have emotions such as fear and jealousy, and they can even make tools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One morning, Jane Goodall ran through three valleys, but she didn&#39;t even see a shadow of a chimpanzee. Just as she was struggling through the steep slope to the top of the peak, there was movement in the grass sixty meters away. Jane Goodall raised the telescope in her hand and saw a chimpanzee squatting next to a termite nest in red clay. A long and thin straw stick is inserted into the termite hole and then lifted up to lick it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few days later, she observed a group of chimpanzees going to a termite nest, picking up a branch with leaves on it, then plucking the leaves from it, and shaping it into a handy tool. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a long time, people have believed that only humans can make tools. This discovery by Jane Goodall is almost subversive. When she telegraphed this to Louis Leakey, he was so excited that he responded: Humanity must be redefined, or chimpanzees must be recognized as human beings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/ccl0MFXqinTiK7UTwh1Uvrs9nSjYGFtwQNQCyMRy.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/ccl0MFXqinTiK7UTwh1Uvrs9nSjYGFtwQNQCyMRy.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255552&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In recent years, Jane Goodall has remained committed to animal and environmental protection, giving lectures around the world, calling on people to be aware of the endangered living situation of chimpanzees and protect ape habitats. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;I can&#39;t leave, this is my life&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>; Jane Goodall once wanted to be a man when she was a child, &quot;Maybe it was because men could do what I wanted to do at that time, but women could not.&quot; At that time, even though she made important discoveries about chimpanzees, with the praise came doubts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people think that because she is an untrained young woman, her research results are not worth mentioning. Some people think that she is famous because of her appearance - she is tall and has beautiful blond hair. Many newspapers at that time emphasized her female identity when publishing, and some even used her beauty as a gimmick. For example, one newspaper&#39;s title was &quot;Beauty and Her Beasts.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;People think I&#39;m famous because of my legs, which is stupid, and I don&#39;t take it to heart, but fame is useful because then I have to raise money myself.&quot; Jane Goodall said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She may be able to try her best to ignore outside comments about her gender and appearance, but for her, it is more difficult to achieve a balance between family and career. After Jane Goodall made her important discovery about chimpanzees, Louise Leakey received a grant from the National Geographic Society, allowing her to continue studying chimpanzees. At the same time, the National Geographic Society also sent a photographer, Hugo Van Rawick, to record the chimpanzees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to guess the direction of the story. Jane Goodall and photographer Hugo fell in love, got married, and studied chimpanzees in Gombe together. Later, however, the National Geographic Society stopped funding Hugo, and his mission as a photographer ended. It was a period of difficult decisions for them. Jane Goodall wanted to continue studying chimpanzees in Gombe, but Hugo could not. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was Jane Goodall who made the sacrifice initially. She spent most of her time with Hugo in the Serengeti, Africa, while Hugo photographed wildlife while she wrote books and took care of her son Guerra. At that time, she served more as Hugo&#39;s assistant and Guerra&#39;s mother. For her work in Gombe, she no longer tracks chimpanzees and is primarily responsible for managing the research station. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, something unexpected happened again, and the polio epidemic suddenly broke out among the chimpanzees in Gombe. Jane Goodall returned to Gombe and decided to spend more time with Gombe&#39;s chimpanzees. At that time, her son was also with her. In the morning, she would analyze data and manage administration, spend an hour or two at the chimpanzee camp observing them, and spend the afternoon with her son Guerra. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But humans are group animals after all, and Jane Goodall understood the importance of sociality. When Guerra reached school age, Jane Goodall had to send him back to England to study. When she was separated from Guerra, she was sad and felt like she had betrayed him. As for her relationship with her husband Hugo, due to the long-term separation between the two places, the relationship seemed to be coming to an end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hugo told Jane Goodall that they had to decide how to live in the future. He needed someone to stay with him in the savannah of the Serengeti, and asked her if she would leave Gombe for him. Jane Goodall wrote to her mother for help. &quot;There is no one who cannot be lost... There is no such thing as heartbreak for men. Their work always comes first, and their dreams. Women are just used to set off.&quot; The mother&#39;s reply read. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jane Goodall made a choice, &quot;I can&#39;t leave, this is my life, and he also has his ideals.&quot; They eventually divorced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Documentary director Brett Morgan interpreted their relationship in an interview with POV magazine, &quot;I think it&#39;s a love story, but it&#39;s not about Jane and Hugo. I think it&#39;s about women. and her career, and the man and his career. Because the real love in the film, the otherworldly love, is their career.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Morgan interviewed Jane∙ in Gombe for the documentary Goodall, he realized, for the couple, &quot;this is a happy ending.&quot; Hugo remained in the Serengeti for the rest of his life photographing wildlife and became recognized as one of the best wildlife photographers of all time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jane Goodall continues to study chimpanzees and write books. Starting in 1986, her focus changed, and she realized that if the plight of African chimpanzees was to be known to the world, the next generation must become better conservationists. Since then, she has been traveling to various countries and cities giving lectures almost 300 days a year. Until now, she has been committed to environmental protection and animal conservation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;How long will you study chimpanzees?&quot; Jane Goodall was asked in an interview, and her answer was:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I think until I die&quot; that day, but I can’t tell you how many years are left.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[这古典探案剧，野心真大]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259236]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;Looking at the famous scenes of domestic suspense dramas, &quot; Li Toyota lit a cigarette in reverse.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/11de423cd6866c95c00a4475d3f942df.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;405&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/11de423cd6866c95c00a4475d3f942df.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;255223&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, Ning The physics teacher had a new memory point - extinguishing candles with bare hands and pulling out teeth.

The feeling of &quot;Along the River During Qingming Festival&quot;. &quot;Along the River During the Qingming Festival&quot; is a genre painting by the Northern Song Dynasty painter Zhang Zeduan. It is very long and full of details. What comes to mind is the antique style and worldly sentiments. Looking more closely, there are many characters with different shapes, and there are twists and turns behind each person. A long story; magnify it 10 times and it will give you a different scenery. It is rumored that there are unknown secrets hidden in the pictures, and there are lice crawling in the Chinese clothes. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This coincides with &quot;Under the City&quot;.

But if you zoom in and study half of the scroll, you will see the shadow of the prosperous age hidden in the details. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I first watched &quot;Under the Busty City&quot;, I felt that the market was prosperous and bustling with people. Officials, squires, traffickers and pawns, women with fireworks, all appeared on stage like a revolving lantern, roughly sketching out the portraits of the people in Jingxian County. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But when you zoom in under the microscope, you will find that everyone from state and county officials to ordinary people are included in a tightly interlocked social and ecological chain, and there are clever and hidden games everywhere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dian Shi Song Chen, Leng Captou and others have specific powers, but in the final analysis they are still low-level officials trapped in an increasingly rigid system and acting according to a set of hidden rules. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dian Shi was a miscellaneous official of the county magistrate. He had no specific rank but was ordered by the emperor to sign and approve. He was in charge of arrests, prisons and other matters, so Song Chen had a certain deterrent effect on arrests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fast class led by the catcher is responsible for arresting murders and investigating cases, and the soap class is responsible for the promotion of the court. There are many people like Gao Shicong in the play who pay to come in as temporary workers.

As long as it did not involve the abduction and trafficking of women and children, he would turn a blind eye. The bank &quot;pays&quot; him a fixed amount of money every month, and also does some dirty work when needed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The salaries of officials in the Ming Dynasty were very low, and quick-thinking people found solutions elsewhere. Part of the kickbacks taken by Leng Captou will be subsidized to the subordinates on the fast shift.

After his master died, he was forced to grow up and started to do things that he didn&#39;t want to do before, such as Use mediation among the three religions and nine streams. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Essentially, he is the same type of person as Song Chen. It is inevitable to wear black gloves after staying in the mud for a long time, but there is a fire of justice in his heart that illuminates the way forward. It is not difficult to speculate that Song Chen will be his new guide and will perform the duties of his master. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/fbe94e7cb0ef6cfa0d2ece822efa9598.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;883&quot; height= &quot;497&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/fbe94e7cb0ef6cfa0d2ece822efa9598.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255240&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s it.

He beat the passers-by and pretended to be evil, and the fake scholar they found pretended to be innocent. They were trying to annex the game within a game. The old man’s property.

In addition, subordinate officials such as Qu Sangen had no right to take scientific examinations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/f705ffc52289396448673bf882f0bb19.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;883&quot; height= &quot;669&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/f705ffc52289396448673bf882f0bb19.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255242&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why Mr. Lu Can you get your household registration done with just a little money?

Insurance, he believes: &quot;In addition to the normal natural decrease, an important reason is that residents actively surrender their insurance. This is mainly because premiums continue to rise. From 2003 to 2023, individual premiums increased 37 times in 20 years. The second The reason is that many uninsured residents are in good health.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This explanation is wrong. The National Medical Insurance Administration&#39;s &quot;2022 Medical Security Development Statistical Report&quot; makes it very clear: as of the end of 2022, the number of people insured by basic medical insurance was 1,345.7 million. With the launch of the national unified medical insurance information platform, all provinces have stepped up data management and comparison. The number of insured people has decreased by 17.27 million year-on-year, mainly due to the elimination of duplicate insurance... Among them, the number of people participating in employee basic medical insurance is 362.42 million, a year-on-year increase of 8.11 million. people; the number of people participating in the basic medical insurance for urban and rural residents was 983.28 million, a year-on-year decrease of 25.38 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Urban and Rural Residents Basic Medical Insurance (referred to as &quot;Resident Medical Insurance&quot;) is the merger of the former Urban Residents Basic Medical Insurance and the New Rural Cooperative Medical System to provide integrated and equal medical protection for urban and rural residents. Its operation model is significantly different from that of the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (referred to as &quot;Employee Medical Insurance&quot;). The biggest difference is that the former is voluntary insurance, while the latter is compulsory insurance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Theoretically, because the resident medical insurance is voluntary, you can of course voluntarily withdraw from the insurance or not participate in the insurance, but it is unwise to do so. Because individuals pay a few hundred yuan per year in premiums for residential medical insurance, which is a small part, and government subsidies are the big part. Regardless of men, women, old or young, the advantageous strategy for individuals is to buy it every year and continue to insure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take Shanghai as an example. The individual payment standards for Shanghai residents’ medical insurance are higher than those in other provinces. In 2022, the individual payment for children&#39;s students is 220 yuan, and the financial subsidy is 1,660 yuan, the latter is 7.5 times the former; the individual payment for 15-59 year olds is 860 yuan, and the financial subsidy is 2,750 yuan, the latter is 3.2 times the former; individuals aged 60-69 years old缴费690元，财政补贴5940元，后者是前者的8.6倍；70周岁以上个人缴费520元，财政补贴6110元，后者是前者的11.8倍。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为个人，如果不需要强制参加职工医保，你会自愿参加居民医保吗？参加后会选择退保吗？答案是不言而喻的。说到底，居民医保是个人出小头+政府财政补贴出大头的筹款模式。当然，再往下推一步，政府财政收入或税收来自工作者与企业缴纳的税金。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比较而言，职工医保是强制参保，以个人税前工资为基数，费率一般是个人缴纳2%，企业缴纳8%，有些城市养老负担重的，企业费率还会高一些。当然，无论是以个人还是企业的名义缴费，本质上都是个人全部工资或企业全部用工成本的一部分。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;职工医保个人最低与最高缴费基数是当地社会平均工资的60%与300%，也就是说，两个人，一个顶格缴最高保费，另一个顶格缴最低保费，前者的缴费是后者的5倍，但这两人除了个人账户余额不一样之外，门诊及住院享受的报销比例是一样的，与个人缴费多少完全无关。这反映了职工医保的代内转移支付属性：高收入者对低收入者的转移支付。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这就导致一些效应：某些处于自由竞争行业、成本敏感的“边际企业”，对于员工参加职工医保，策略是只让“正式员工”参加，或者做低员工税前工资，因为，在企业眼里，职工医保强制缴费有显著的税性，自然是能避就避了；某些人是灵活就业或自由职业，TA明智的做法是不参加职工医保，因为“太贵了”，而选择参加居民医保。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;再对比一下居民医保与职工医保参保者享受的医疗待遇。囿于文章篇幅，这里略过门诊不谈，只比较住院报销比例。不难发现，在两者个人支付成本相差悬殊的前提下，居民医保参保者的住院报销比例比职工医保低得并不多。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同样以上海为例。目前居民医保住院或急诊观察室报销比例，在50-300元的费用自负段之上，婴幼儿与学生为80%(一级)-70%(二级)-60%(三级)，19至59周岁为80%(一级)-75%(二级)-60%(三级)，60至69周岁为90%(一级)-80%(二级)-70%(三级)，70周岁以上为70%(一级)-60%(二级)-50%(三级)，括号内为医院等级。医院等级越低，报销比例越高，这是鼓励参保者尽量去基层医院。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比较而言，目前职工医保住院或急诊观察室，在职职工报销比例，起付标准以上、最高支付限额以下为85%，最高限额以上为80%；退休职工报销比例，起付标准以上、最高限额以下为92%，最高支付限额以上为80%。比居民医保报销比例是要高一些。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由此不难看出职工医保的代际转移支付属性：工作者、年轻人与下一代对退休者、老年人与上一代的转移支付，或者可以直观理解为“所有的子女养所有的父母”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，无论居民医保还是职工医保，虽然名为保险，但和一般商业保险的运作逻辑是不一样的。商业保险，会根据参保人的年龄与健康状况，精算确定与收取保费，患有某些疾病会被拒保，个人参保前不能隐瞒某些疾病否则可能被拒赔。如果每年收取一个固定的保费，其实意味着会在年轻时多收一些，因为年轻时生病的概率低，收取的保费扣除当年的消费额就是所谓的“现金价值”。而政府医保，并不会因参保人的年龄太大或身体太差而拒保，也不会根据个人的年龄与健康状况精算保费。所以，这是一种保障(Security)。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总之，如果你父母在城里无业或在乡下，督促或替他们购买居民医保是明智的选择。在此基础上，再给他们购买大病医疗互助补充保险也是不错的选择。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[莫砺锋：“花瓣飘落的方向，是风决定的”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259413]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Doctoral Profile&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot; font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Mo Lizhen, the first doctor of literature in New China. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Born in April 1949 in Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;1963-1966, attended high school in Suzhou Senior High School, Jiangsu Province. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From 1968 to 1977, he worked in farming in Taicang County, Jiangsu Province and Si County, Anhui Province. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;1978-1979, undergraduate student majoring in English in the Department of Foreign Languages, Anhui University. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;1979-1981, Master&#39;s degree student in ancient Chinese literature in the Department of Chinese, Nanjing University, studying under Cheng Qianfan Mr., received a Master of Arts degree. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In 1982, he became a doctoral candidate in ancient literature in the Chinese Department of Nanjing University. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In October 1984, graduated from Nanjing University majoring in ancient Chinese literature.

There was a black thermos cup and a plain backpack on the lectern. An old man wearing a light blue long-sleeved shirt and rimless glasses sat on the lectern and said, &quot;Thank you to the students of NTU for not treating me like this so far.&quot; After leaving the podium, I completed my teaching career.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The old man&#39;s name is Mo Lifeng. He is a professor at the School of Liberal Arts of Nanjing University, the director of the Chinese Poetry Research Center of Nanjing University, and the first president of Mei&#39;an Academy. At the age of 74, he completed the last lesson of his teaching career that day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 1979, Mo Lizhen was admitted to Nanjing University and began to study ancient literature. He later stayed at the school to teach. This is now his 44th year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is little known is that Mo Lizhen was also the first doctor of literature in New China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1981, the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council announced the list of the first batch of doctoral supervisors in New China. This group of industry elites, who represented the highest level of academic circles at that time, trained the first batch of PhDs in New China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 1984, Mo Lifeng’s doctoral thesis defense was broadcast on CCTV’s news network, and he also received the first doctorate in literature certificate after the founding of the People’s Republic of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a senior professor in the field of ancient Chinese literature, Mo Lizhen had nothing to do with ancient literature in the first half of his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 1949, Mo Lizhen was born in Wuxi, Jiangsu. In 1966, when he graduated from high school, he applied for the engineering major at Tsinghua University. In July of that year, the college entrance examination enrollment was suspended, and the dream of becoming an engineer was shattered in an instant. For the next ten years, he went to the countryside to join the army and spent his bitter youth in the fields. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the college entrance examination was resumed in 1977, his life turned around - he entered the English major of Anhui University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, with the launch of reform and opening up and the resumption of postgraduate education, Mo Lizhen seized the opportunity again. In 1979, the second year after the postgraduate examination was resumed, after studying for three semesters in the English Department of Anhui University, he was admitted to the postgraduate program of the Chinese Department of Nanjing University and embarked on the research path of ancient literature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After retirement, he is still committed to the popularization of Tang and Song poetry, giving lectures and participating in book fairs... He once said that his biggest wish is to stand at the entrance of the &quot;Secret Land of Fairy Mountains&quot; about Tang poetry and Song poetry, giving guidance to tourists. On the way into the mountains, the tour guide explains the scenery along the way and tells everyone where there is a unique flavor and where there are winding paths. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2023, it was raining continuously in the south of the Yangtze River, passers-by were in a hurry, and the leaves of the sycamore tree fell with the raindrops. In a residential area in Xuanwu District, Nanjing, Mo Lizhen talked about his life experience. He quoted the Southern Dynasty philosopher Fan Zhen&#39;s metaphor of &quot;petals falling in the wind&quot; to describe his destiny - &quot;petals on a tree&quot; When it is blown down by the wind, the direction it falls is not determined by the petals, but by the wind.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;There is no other way but to study&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You In previous interviews, you often mentioned your father, and also talked about the scene where &quot;brothers and sisters competed with their father to recite Tang poems.&quot; Did your love for literature sprout from your family environment? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;My father comes from a rural area in Henan Province. He attended junior high school for more than a year. When the Japanese invaded China, he dropped out of school and became a soldier. After liberation, she has been working in a local supply and marketing cooperative, and her mother has only attended the first grade of junior high school. When I was young, my family was poor, so I read Tang poetry because my father happened to have a copy of &quot;Three Hundred Tang Poems&quot; at home. My father liked it, so we read it too. It was not until I graduated from high school and went to work in the countryside that I came into contact with more classical works. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The influence of my parents on me has nothing to do with the profession I am currently engaged in. Their biggest influence on me is that I am very sincere, hard-working, and have a good attitude towards life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You have always performed very well on your way to school. I applied for the Department of Electrical Engineering and the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics at Tsinghua University, but learned that the college entrance examination was suspended before the college entrance examination. How did I face this huge gap at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I was in high school at Suzhou Middle School, which was a very good school. When I was in elementary and middle school, my performance in Chinese was average, but my math, physics and chemistry were pretty good. I graduated from high school in 1966, but that year the college entrance examination was abolished. All middle and high school students from 1966 to 1968 went to the countryside, and the university stopped recruiting students. Everyone is disappointed, but we have no choice but to face it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You started going to the countryside in the late autumn of 1968. During the ten years when I went to the countryside, I read tirelessly after working hard, and even read a &quot;Dictionary of New Terms&quot; intensively. You also mentioned the experience of reading by lighting a kerosene lamp. What was the reading environment like at that time? Did you have much time for reading? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In fact, I don’t have much time to read. Collective labor took up a lot of time. At that time, rural areas in Jiangnan were really intensively farmed, and they spent a long time in the fields every day. Only when it rains heavily and around the Spring Festival, there is no work in the fields, and you can read a book on those days. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no electricity in the village, so they can only light kerosene lamps for lighting. One pound of kerosene is supplied as a quota for a month, and it is all consumed in a week, and there is no way to buy more. So, basically you have to sleep when it gets dark. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The books I read are also disorganized, because the books I get are all by chance, and I have no idea what I will read next. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What are most other people doing? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I have many educated youth friends who basically don’t study, but play poker. At that time, the &quot;uselessness of reading&quot; theory was popular. We used sickles and hoes to participate in agricultural labor, and the production team raised 6 cows to plow the fields. These agricultural labors did not require book knowledge. Everyone thought that reading was a stupid thing. In 1972, the university began to recruit workers, peasants and soldiers, but the number of places was very small and a recommendation system was adopted. Most people had no hope of entering the university, and I had no hope. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In this complete &quot;theory that reading is useless&quot; In this case, why do you love reading? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There are many reasons for this. First, I like reading. If I don’t read at all, I will feel that life is meaningless. Second, I was completely deprived of the opportunity to go to university. I felt resentful and determined to finish &quot;my university&quot; like Gorky. For self-study learning, there is no other way than reading. Five or six years after I went to the countryside, I completely gave up any hope of going to college again in this life. In fact, it was no longer possible. At that time, the higher authorities called on us to &quot;take root in the countryside&quot; for the rest of our lives. I was already mentally prepared to be a farmer who loves reading all my life. Farming and reading are a way of life advocated by our ancestors. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, I have a vague feeling that the current situation of &quot;theory that reading is useless&quot; is abnormal. It will end sooner or later, but I don&#39;t know how long it will take. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/kfYND0AoqQx1wySkbrnVoXKWkoIQEKvbM5MTtRq9.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;865&quot; height= &quot;575&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/kfYND0AoqQx1wySkbrnVoXKWkoIQEKvbM5MTtRq9.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255704&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1979, Mo Lizhen was admitted as a graduate student in the Chinese Department of Nanjing University and embarked on the research path of ancient literature. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(People&#39;s Vision/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;When I applied for the exam, I didn’t know who Cheng Qianfan was&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What was the opportunity for you to apply for the English Department of Anhui University when you took the college entrance examination in 1977? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I was in Anhui at that time. The provincial admissions regulations at that time stipulated that candidates should not be over 25 years old. Only those with &quot;academic expertise&quot; &quot;Only the third grade of high school students are allowed to apply for the exam over the age limit. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was 28 years old and had graduated from high school 11 years ago, but I didn’t have any expertise. The cultural and educational officers in the commune sympathized with me. He noticed that I was reading a thick original English novel during that time, which I borrowed from my classmate’s uncle. The officer recognized that I was good at English, so he allowed me to register for the college entrance examination with the qualification of “specializing in English”. After enrolling in school, I found that some students actually filled in the &quot;study expertise&quot; casually, and no one came to evaluate it at all. But I was more honest, so I signed up for the English major and was admitted to the English Department of Anhui University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the year of reform and opening up in 1978, postgraduate education was also restored, and You were studying in the English Department of Anhui University for three semesters, and then you decided to apply for a graduate degree in the Chinese Department of Nanjing University. What was your original intention for doing so? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The original intention is very simple. The monthly scholarship can be increased from 18 yuan to 35 yuan. I received a monthly stipend of 18 yuan at Ann University, so my money was very tight. On the morning when I set out from the dormitory of Anda University to go to the Provincial Department of Education to check the admissions catalogs of famous universities, I had not yet thought about applying for the Chinese Department. I originally wanted to take the exam at the Foreign Languages ​​Department of NTU, but the Foreign Languages ​​Department requires me to take a second foreign language test - French, German or Spanish. But I had never studied it, so I could only temporarily change it to the Chinese department. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You were only your sophomore year when you applied for graduate school. It shouldn&#39;t have been common at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It was not allowed to take the postgraduate entrance examination in my sophomore year, but it was special at that time. The common situation among our 77-year undergraduate students is that the students are older. The oldest and youngest in my class are 13 years apart. At that time, the English major of the Department of Foreign Languages ​​at Ann University was divided into 7 classes, and I was in Class 7. Class 6 is an express class. Many students are from Beijing and Shanghai and have a good foundation in English. They believe that they have the level to graduate from a bachelor&#39;s degree. So, they asked the school to take the postgraduate entrance examination in advance. The school did not agree at first, but they kept trying. In the end, the school relented and said, considering that you are older, you will study for four more years as an undergraduate and you will be in your thirties when you graduate. That’s when I decided to open this hole. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My classmates encouraged me to take the postgraduate entrance examination with my classmates in Class 6. As a result, I happened to pass the exam, so I came to Nantah University to study ancient Chinese literature. The most interesting thing is that when I applied, I knew nothing about ancient literature at NTU. When I saw that the tutor on the admission brochure was Mr. Cheng Qianfan, I had no idea who he was. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From science and engineering to English to ancient literature, we are doing these Are there any consistent principles or concepts when making important choices? How do you view the contingency and inevitability among them? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;These are not decided by me, but by fate. I am a person who goes with my fate. I have often said in recent years that we are like petals on a tree, which float down as soon as the wind blows them. We don’t know where they will float in advance. The direction of the float is not determined by the petals, but by the wind. I just drifted to Nanda. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Accidentality definitely contains inevitability, but from the perspective of the overall environment, it is still accidental. If the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; had not broken out in 1966, I would either have failed to get into Tsinghua University, or I would have studied engineering if I had gotten into it. My biggest ideal at that time was to be an engineer, and my father also expected the same from me. Unfortunately, it was many years after his death that I entered college. It is the biggest regret in my life that my father did not see me become a college student, graduate student, and university professor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fate of the third generation is almost the same. They have no choice in many things. Some classmates were lucky enough to be recruited back then, but after arriving in the city, they had to follow the arrangements of which factory they would work in and what kind of work they would do. We are very lucky to be able to recruit workers. We are all very envious. After all, we can get wages, but farmers can only earn work points, and the value of a day&#39;s work points is only two or three cents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, there is also subjective initiative in this. I have never given up studying, but many classmates have given up. Some of my classmates in Suzhou Middle School had very good grades, but after the college entrance examination was resumed, they had already gotten married and had families with two or three children, so they no longer wanted to take the exam. They were soon laid off and had no chance of college in their lives. There are many such people. When encountering that &quot;strong wind&quot;, they were blown into the mud and never had a chance to stand up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/lmKOzcxvroJZpvIKZIXnQFhta4ogGIFCqRVVjxH7.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;865&quot; height= &quot;618&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/lmKOzcxvroJZpvIKZIXnQFhta4ogGIFCqRVVjxH7.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255705&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1980, Mo Lizhen and his tutor Cheng Qianfan discussed academic issues in the study. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Ascetic training&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Your teacher-student friendship with Mr. Cheng Qianfan has also been praised by everyone.

We do not distinguish between master&#39;s and doctoral students when enrolling, they are collectively referred to as graduate students. President Kuang Yaming said that you will be the first batch of masters and doctoral students in the future. We graduated two years later and the degree regulations were promulgated. I received my master&#39;s degree and later continued my Ph.D. studies with Mr. Cheng. I think studying for a Ph.D. is a good thing, and it doesn’t feel “adventurous” at all. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Before you actually start studying for a Ph.D., what do you think about the Ph.D. What are the expectations of life? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There are no specific expectations. Who knows what a PhD career will be like. I just feel that studying for a master&#39;s degree is so hard and stressful, and studying for a PhD will definitely make it even more stressful, so I am mentally prepared to sit on the bench for a few years. Anyway, I went through a lot of hardships when I was young. &quot;There was a time when it was difficult to find water in the sea.&quot; Studying for a Ph.D. will definitely not be more difficult than farming. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;At that time, we did not have independent Ph.D. As the first batch of PhDs in literature, how did you study for your PhD, take classes and write your doctoral thesis? It is said that when you first started studying for a Ph.D., Mr. Cheng didn’t know how far the doctoral thesis would go. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;That’s true, because doctorate is a new thing in China. There was no complete curriculum system at that time, and the training model was explored in secret. Mr. Cheng didn&#39;t know how far he would go in writing his doctoral thesis. He borrowed a bunch of foreign published doctoral theses from the school library, as well as many doctoral theses from universities in Hong Kong and Taiwan. He read several of them before he had an idea. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Where does Mr. Cheng’s training method come from? Forming? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think he figured it out himself. Of course, it may also be derived from the academic standards of doctoral dissertations abroad or in Hong Kong and Taiwan. from. Since I was the only doctoral student in the department at that time, Mr. Cheng did not teach me any classes. Except for foreign languages, my course study was entirely based on special book reading, that is, I read by myself, and when I encountered difficulties, I went to my husband’s house for advice. Mr. Cheng asked me to study eight classics: &quot;The Book of Songs&quot;, &quot;Chu Ci&quot;, &quot;The Analects of Confucius and Mencius&quot;, &quot;Laozi and Zhuangzi&quot;, &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot;, &quot;Historical Records&quot;, &quot;Selected Works&quot; and &quot;Wen Xin Diao Long&quot;. Each book required a reading report, and four of the reports were later published as academic papers. That kind of training model is a bit like the old-time craftsmen taking apprentices. The master teaches step by step, and the apprentice learns while working. For a subject like ancient Chinese literature, that method is quite effective. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When graduate education was resumed in 1978, students were admitted that year 10,000 people. Today, there are approximately 560,000 PhD students. Many doctoral students cannot help but worry about their employment prospects and are confused about the future, especially liberal arts doctoral students. Are you also confused when you graduate with your PhD, and how do you deal with their current worries and confusion? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When I graduated with my PhD in 1984, I was assigned a job and could choose from many units. In the end, I chose to stay at NTU. At that time, the number of people with master&#39;s and doctorate degrees trained by the country was small, and there was objectively no employment pressure. This is different from the situation of many liberal arts doctorates today. I understand the current students very well. There are many doctoral students but few positions. After years of large-scale expansion of postgraduate enrollment, most units have no shortage of people, so it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a job. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is entirely a problem of the times, not a personal problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is also difficult for my students to find jobs. If I can&#39;t find a job, the pressure will extend to me. Of course, the three doctoral students who graduated this year have all found jobs, going to Sichuan University, South Central University for Nationalities and Zhejiang Normal University respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/1oMhfOmrHc3MQsFfLDaH9gy2B27iG9KPackfRB5z.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;865&quot; height= &quot;577&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/1oMhfOmrHc3MQsFfLDaH9gy2B27iG9KPackfRB5z.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255703&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 2008, Mo Lizhen signed a book signing for Baijia Forum in Beijing. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Committed to researching &quot;everyone&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You once mentioned that the study of ancient literature is mainly about reversing the case, because all viewpoints have been People have said that the new point of view is to write an article to reverse the verdict.

What is your original intention in choosing to study these &quot;masters&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In fact, all academic research is about reversing the case, and the same is true for science and engineering. When I was studying for a PhD at NTU, the school recruited 10 doctoral students in the first batch, each from a different department. There are three people living in our dormitory, one from the chemistry department and the other from the computer science department. I communicated with them and found that they do research, find topics and write papers, just like us. They all make a living in the cracks of previous achievements, in very small directions. Pursue some innovations to supplement or overturn previous research results. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But for the subject of ancient literature, what can truly represent the academic achievements of an era should be &quot;everyone&#39;s&quot; research. Whether there is an overall breakthrough in the research of an era depends on how well &quot;everyone&quot; studies. &quot;Xiaojia&quot; research only fills the gap and cannot become a symbol of the academic level of an era. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Your two favorite poets are Du Fu and Su Shi, and you even once You said you were willing to travel back in time to the Song Dynasty and go to Huangzhou to help Su Shi farm. What do you think is the biggest realization they brought you in the process of studying Du Fu and Su Shi? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This may be related to Mr. Cheng’s proposition that “literary research should focus on feelings and words”. I started reading Du Fu and Su Shi before I entered college. The only motivation at that time was that I liked them. I felt warm and comforted when I read them. I have said many times that when I spent the night in that thatched hut whose roof was torn by the strong wind, and shivered with cold while looking at the sky full of stars, Du Fu&#39;s &quot;Song of Thatched Cottage Broken by the Autumn Wind&quot; brought me spiritual joy. Shocking. I have been farming for ten years, and I feel that being a farmer is not an inconvenience. But I really don’t want Su Dongpo to open up wasteland and farm in Huangzhou. An outstanding person like him with both ability and political integrity has more important things to do! &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The biggest realization that Du and Su brought to me is the human sentiment of &quot;being able to live in thousands of houses&quot; and the attitude towards life of &quot;taking care of one&#39;s life under the mist and rain&quot;. Willing to promote them as much as I can. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How did you achieve innovation in your &quot;Everyone&quot; research? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;True innovation is difficult. How can I do it? Because innovation requires you to see deeper or further than others, I don’t have that high level. In addition, innovation also requires chance. A good new topic or precious new material happens to appear. These are rare. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I can only try my best not to follow what others say and not to repeat the same thing. I have done a lot of popularization work now, and I talk about some common sense content, but how to explain the common sense content accurately is also very demanding, which should be consistent with academic rigor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I have noticed that since entering the &quot;Baijia Forum&quot;, you have You have been committed to popularizing classical poetry. What was the opportunity to start popularizing it?

Has this wish come true now? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It was also by chance that I went to &quot;Hundred Schools Forum&quot;. During NTU&#39;s 100th Anniversary, we invited editors and directors from CCTV to record the program. After the recording, it was broadcast on the &quot;Hundred Forum&quot; and the effect was pretty good. Later, they came to me to talk about Tang poetry. After the program was broadcast, many viewers wrote in and the response was enthusiastic. I feel that the popularization work is quite meaningful. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What I want to achieve most now is to make ordinary readers like Tang poetry and Song lyrics, Du Fu and Su Dongpo as much as I do. The so-called popularization means stepping out of the small classroom of school and heading towards the cathedral of society. What makes me happy is that when I give lectures, the audience includes people of all ages and identities. I have really reached the public, which can be regarded as realizing my wish. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Do you think the academic research and popularization of ancient literature are relevant nowadays? Facing some difficulties? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Current research tends to be conceptual and fragmented, while popularization work tends to become vulgar. The former, for example, must forcibly discover the modernity in some classical poems, but in fact there may not be. If some new terms are used to label something, the conclusion will not be consistent with the historical truth. There are also some scholars who choose topics that are too detailed and of little significance. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Popularization work has a tendency to become vulgar. In order to attract the audience and cater to the tastes of young people, there are many jokes and misinterpretations, and the complete artistic conception of the ancients is fragmented and lacks a sense of integrity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Is there any solution? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This problem is inevitable.

Because the lives of us ordinary people are bound to be full of ups and downs, we cannot imagine that we will embark on a smooth life path, so we must be fully mentally prepared. Please let me quote a few words from my speech at Ann University to send to college students and graduate students from other universities: &quot;I sincerely hope that students, like Dongpo, will always treat life with a positive attitude of &#39;continuous self-improvement&#39; and make a difference.&quot; . I also sincerely hope that when students encounter ups and downs in life, they will encourage themselves with the motto of &#39;You can live your life in the mist and rain&#39; and deal with it calmly!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 09:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[演唱会刷屏朋友圈，李健是中产抚慰者？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259370]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&quot;When I miss you, you are in the sky; when I miss you, you are right in front of me.&quot; Recently, Li Jian held the &quot;Like the Sea&quot; online concert, which received more than 30 million views in 2 hours and quickly became a hit in the circle of friends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In today&#39;s crowded entertainment industry, there are indeed few singers as lovable as Li Jian. We rarely hear music critics criticizing him, and we don’t see various marketing accounts on Weibo spreading any negative information about him. He is just famous, so popular that it is so natural and so popular that everyone expects it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/huSjlbT3I3FOoTHypGp5yeS64ovaHlSp8XRIbh88.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;660&quot; height= &quot;440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/huSjlbT3I3FOoTHypGp5yeS64ovaHlSp8XRIbh88.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255635&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>; Birth: &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Intellectual temperament&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Li Jian has such confidence. He graduated from Tsinghua University with a major in electronic engineering. Compared with many singers whose academic qualifications or cultural qualities are “meager”, Li Jian is outstanding. “Tsinghua top student” is an extremely enviable status, but it is also different from our expectations of science and engineering. The impression that a man is slovenly, unkempt, and ordinary-looking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What’s more important is Li Jian’s intellectual temperament. Li Jian’s home is neatly filled with records and books. The records he listens to include Leonard Cohen, The Beatles, Freshly Ground, Michael Buble, and Fabio Zanon, and the books he reads include Borges, Zweig, and Lawrence Bubble. Locke, George Orwell, and the last thing he took out was Leonard Cohen&#39;s biography &quot;I&#39;m Your Man.&quot; He has the sobriety and self-control of an intellectual. He consciously keeps a certain distance from the materialistic world and pursues advancement in the spiritual world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From his song selection, we can also see his independent temperament. Some people say that he is a &quot;musical poet&quot;, but in fact, he highlights more of his &quot;musical pride.&quot; For example, the online concert included 10 private covers and 14 original works, explaining his inner feelings about the sea and poetry. Li Jian is always singing in a low voice. He does not show off his skills or hit the high notes. His melody is soft and beautiful, and his singing voice is ethereal and graceful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the side of Li Jian&#39;s birth - he does not pursue external fame and wealth, but rather his pursuit, pride and persistence as an independent individual. In the lavish entertainment industry, he has not lost himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/eAAaCHmRWWJ7NoJc5uuf8J6QNxhWB6R48hPNeYUt.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;660&quot; height= &quot;440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/eAAaCHmRWWJ7NoJc5uuf8J6QNxhWB6R48hPNeYUt.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255636&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>; Entering the WTO: I wish the newly graduated &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;all the best&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;If this was all Li Jian looked like, maybe it would be difficult for him to be so lovable. After all, there are many aloof singer-songwriters in the music industry - for example, Liang Bo, whose song &quot;Soul Singer&quot; shocked everyone, but his popularity and audience base are far less than those of Li Jian, not to mention other niche singers. What is unique about Li Jian is that he also has a worldly side. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Li Jian is not obsessed with material things, he is able to live a good life. He works out, travels, knows coffee, has a special tea room at home, and collects records... Every time he appears in front of the camera, his clothes always make people feel comfortable and comfortable. Li Jian&#39;s life has a cold style. He is not a popular brand that can be seen everywhere on the street. He is Fendi, LV and Hermes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In some interviews, you can see that Li Jian is concerned about some issues that arise in social development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, the topic &quot;I hope everyone will experience less setbacks and hardships&quot; became a hot topic on Weibo. Not long ago, he told young people at a concert: &quot;I hope all people can live a simple and easy life.&quot; &quot;You can live a good life without putting in a lot of effort, especially those who have just graduated. It would be better if you experience less setbacks and tribulations. I wish you all the best.&quot; He is not cynical about the predicament. , not hoarse, but blessing and moving forward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just like his song selection, he is always singing about love, hometown, childhood, moonlight, stars, years and other beautiful things. He does not directly criticize vulgarity, but he sings about beautiful things in a tortuous way. this purpose. You might say Li Jian is &quot;conservative&quot;, but he is very safe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;何况，李健还是一个接地气的“耿直boy+高萌的段子手+可爱的吃货”，轻描淡写就能够把许多严肃的、刻板的话语方式消解掉，让人会心一笑，并察觉到他的可爱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总之，在李健身上，出世和入世是如此完美地组合在一起。很多人只能做到一点，或者连一点都做不好，或者在二者之间撕扯纠缠，李健完美地拥有了二者，他是很多人的人格理想。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;无怪乎不少评论说，李健是中产的灵魂抚慰者。李健的歌迷虽然囊括了各个群体，但诚如媒体人朱伟所说，喜欢李健的人主要是“文青”“小资”“受过良好教育且感情细腻的群体”。这些人都是属于中产阶层或者预备中产阶层。如果说中国中产阶层有什么显著的特点，在出世入世之间“撕扯”便是其一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中产们既有入世的一面，他们追求物质，追求格调，安分守己，保守中庸，渴望岁月静好、现世安稳的生活；可遗憾的是，为了这岁月静好，他们又得奔走在大都市的钢筋水泥森林，疲于应付职场中的快节奏与复杂人际，承受巨大的生活压力与精神压力，稳定安逸的生活似乎触不可及。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;于是他们又有出世的一面，他们很想逃离这一切，不去理会什么房子、车子、孩子、职场，想辟出一块属于自己的精神家园，屏蔽外界的一切纷纷扰扰；但真的要放下这一切，他们又会有所眷恋，有所不甘。中产的撕扯是因为他们无论是出世或入世，均不可得。于是他们时常在二者之间彷徨犹豫，左手是马云，右手是星云。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李健完美出世又完美入世，他活成了许多中产想活成的模样，他就这样成了中产的抚慰者。这样说绝不是贬低李健，李健无意于扮演这样的角色，他只是刚好踩到了时代的节点上——这个时代的中产阶层真是太累了。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;h4>;所谓“祖源分析”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;人类遗传主要分为父系、母系、常染色体三个部分。其中父系溯源比较直观，就是查Y染色体，因为其只能从父亲传给儿子；而母系溯源的原理也差不多，就是查线粒体基因。无论男女，线粒体都只能从母亲那里获得。但Y染色体和线粒体，都只占人类基因非常小的一部分。而父母各给一半的常染色体，则占比超过98%，可以说常染色体真正决定了你是谁。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;各种商业检测所谓的“祖源分析”，也基本都把常染色体作为最大卖点。如果不了解原理，可能就会被误导——所谓的祖源分析，其实是先把全世界各地的主要人群，都抽样测一下存档。然后再用你的检测结果，去和档案里已有的数据比对，看看和哪些人群最接近。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以如果你测出来了“40%的南方汉族，50%的北方汉族，10%的蒙古族”，这并不表示你的100位祖宗里，有40个南方人，50个北方人，10个蒙古人——这个检测结果仅仅表示，你和该公司的北方汉族样本最接近，其次是南方汉族样本，最后是蒙古族样本。把这3个样本按以上比例混合得到的常染色体数据，和你的检测结果接近，仅此而已。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而我们都知道，东亚大陆没有种姓内婚制，南北人群的基因肯定是渐变的。加上各机构取样不同，结果就是同一个人在不同公司往往会测出不同结果：比如有的机构取山西汉族为“北方汉族样本”，于是山西汉族去测，就会测出来“100%北方汉族”；而有的公司以华北汉族为北方样本，山西汉族去测，又可能测出来“蒙古血统”了......&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以从本质上来说，这不是“祖源分析”，而是“亲戚分析”。但你和某个人群接近，就必定有共同祖先，所以虽然是商业噱头，但也不算凭空捏造，还是有其科学依据的。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;满族基因与汉族无异&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“我从哪里来”是全世界人类都感兴趣的哲学问题，基因检测这么火也是自然之中了。为了吸引顾客，各大基因公司也纷纷完善样本数据库，希望能给所有族群都筛选出没有争议的比对样本——然而这个宏大计划，却在满族基因上碰了一鼻子灰。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为一个人口上千万的民族，各大机构对满族反复取样计算，却发现始终无法得到满族的标杆样本。无论怎么扩大样本量，改善分析方法，即使对满族的抽样人数已经达到数千人，却依然是一个结论：满族无论父系、母系、常染色体，都与汉族没有区别。如果用已有标杆样本进行分析，那么现代满族群体的民族血统，以北方汉（80%）、南方汉（6.57%）、日韩（5%）、蒙古-通古斯（3%）等成分为主。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这样的结果，让很多学者和人类学爱好者都很惊讶：其他通古斯语人群，比如鄂伦春族，和汉族的基因差异是非常明显的。满族在遗传上却和汉族几乎一致，要知道清朝是严禁满汉（旗民）通婚的，那么满族作为通古斯语系的一员，到底是怎么变成汉人血统的？&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;掠奴传统&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;一个可能的解释是，这和满洲（女真）社会的掠奴传统有关。满洲入关前后还处在奴隶社会，每次出征都必定大量掠夺平民作为奴隶，满语称为“阿哈”，如果是家生奴隶就叫“包衣阿哈”。比如明朝成化三年，明军深入打击建州女真，一次战役就解救了1165名沦为女真奴隶的汉人。而随着建州女真的不断崛起，掠奴的规模也越来越大，动辄以万计。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后金/清对明朝掠奴的人数规模，目前国内没有研究。但同时期清朝也对明朝属国“李氏朝鲜”多次用兵，根据史料记载，1636年丙子战争，清军将60万朝鲜官民男女掠为奴隶，押回沈阳市场贩卖（这个数字还不包括清军中的蒙古士兵掠往蒙古的朝鲜人口数）。现代学者大多认为60万有所夸大，实际数量大概在40万-50万。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而在整个明清易代战争中，清军掳掠的汉人恐怕更难以计数了。比如1698年来华的法国传教士巴多明，就在写给法国科学院的信中提到：“年老的鞑靼人在关内渐渐死去，他们的子女更容易学习被征服地的语言而不是父辈的语言，因为他们的母亲和仆人几乎全是汉人”——可见清初的满洲家庭，女眷和仆人都源自掳掠来的汉人奴隶。这样几代之后，其母系和常染色体遗传，必定都会变得和汉人无异，母语也会自然替换成汉语。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;清代战争制度与抱养继嗣&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;然而现代满族的父系遗传，也和汉族相差无几，这就不能只用清军掠夺汉女来解释了。有一种观点推测，这可能和清代独特的战争制度导致的旗人家庭抱养继嗣成风有关：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很多历史爱好者都注意到，明代调兵动辄数万数十万，比如万历年间的播州之役，三省各出兵8万，合计24万明军。而清代却只能一次调动数千士兵，最多也不过一两万人。比如乾隆年间的某场边境战争，开战初期居然只派出3000八旗兵和100名侍卫巴图鲁。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因为清军必须首先防范汉地起义，因此绿营极度碎片化，分散在全国各地。然后在各个关键城市设立满城，调入八旗驻防。通过相对集中的八旗，去监视绿营。如果某个地方出现了民变，可以第一时间出兵弹压。把起义消灭在萌芽状态，同时防止汉人构成的绿营坐大。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是这种碎片化的军制，一旦碰到外敌入侵，或是需要组织军队对外进攻，就很难凑出一支规模庞大的军队了。先不说调兵需要极长的时间，为了保证对内的镇压力度，只能抽调小部分兵员。即使花了大力气凑出了一支稍具规模的，这支军队也是各种支离破碎的小部队集合体，缺乏组织度，难以用于打大规模会战。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;顺治五年编审完成的丁册记载，八旗壮丁共计34.7万人，其中满洲5.5万人，蒙古2.9万人，汉军4.6万人。而满、蒙古旗下家奴汉人21.7万人，占比达62.5%。满蒙汉八旗，共计13万壮丁，是战斗兵的主力。这些清军一半在北京，一半分散各地满城驻防。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此清初八旗每次出兵，抽调1万人都是大兵团了。这样的结果是，满洲士兵在各种战争中被快速消耗，而汉人家奴不参军打仗，即使随军也以承担辅助和后勤工作为主。这部分人口在清初一系列战争中，受到的人口损失应该是最小的。而且家奴算是八旗的私产，如果折损了，旗人还会想办法“补充”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;等到雍正年间，清朝在和通泊战役中仅仅损失7000八旗兵，就把京城旗人打得家家披麻戴孝。接下来乾隆又号称“十全武功”，战争愈加频繁，八旗人口的损失来不及通过自然生育填补。很多旗人家庭男丁战死后又亲族凋零，只能偷偷从汉人家奴里抱养孩童为养子以充门户，避免家门绝断，一家女眷无人赡养。民间一直有传说，乾隆抱养自海宁陈氏，其故事原型可能就来源于此。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;

&lt;p>;不仅如此，母亲的两间屋里还囤了很多旧物，不知多少年前的衣服鞋帽，生锈的铁锅铁铲、农具，甚至父亲在世时从新疆带给她的棉毡、毛毯、羊皮袄，破破烂烂，乱七八糟。我们要给她清理出去，母亲宝贝似的护着，生怕我们趁她不注意，给当垃圾丢掉。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在一些乡村、城镇，有我母亲这种习惯的老人还相当普遍。有的囤得少一些，分门别类摆放；有的囤得多，摆得杂乱无序；还有的垃圾与日常用品相混杂，干脆在垃圾堆里吃睡。据了解，这多为孤寡老人所为，捡来的垃圾能卖出去的很少，因无力再转移出去，久而久之他们就与垃圾共存。还有的老人有儿有女，也爱囤破烂儿，其行为习惯常遭儿女们厌烦，甚至被讥笑为“恋旧狂”“神经病”，劝也劝不住，不胜其扰。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些老年人为何爱囤“破烂儿”？究其原因，我通过调查发现，不外乎以下几点：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一是基于节俭，不忍丢弃老物件。老年人苦日子过惯了，对家中旧物件能将就用就用，很少添置新衣新用品，即使儿女给买了，也往往不习惯，还是觉得旧的好，舍不得丢弃。对于捡来的破烂儿，有些老人并非为卖钱，而是觉得丢掉可惜。老家村里的王老汉喜欢收年轻人淘汰的旧家具，常见他用三轮车吭哧吭哧往家运。有人问他：“你攒这么多，自己用得了吗？”王老汉说：“都是上好的木料，这在以前上哪儿找呀！我拆解开，还能派上用场。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;二是基于怀旧，破烂儿里有温度有感情。不少老人存有恋旧物的心理，很多衣物用品跟随了几十年，旧物有记忆、有故事、有感情。在我家，母亲对堆了两间屋的破烂儿有着深厚的感情，特别是父亲的遗物，安葬时她留下了一部分，每次要给她处理掉，母亲总要絮叨：“你们当垃圾扔了，我到哪儿去想你爸？我拿出这些物儿，摩挲摩挲，念叨念叨，就像是和他说说话儿……”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;三是基于孤独，借以排解寂寞。这种情况在爱囤破烂的老人中，更为普遍。听母亲讲，张婶的三个孩子都在发达地区打工，收入不菲，每月都按时给她汇钱来，应该说张婶衣食无忧。可她却起早贪黑，风雨无阻，到处捡垃圾。张婶道出了缘由：“儿女们都知道孝敬，俺什么都不缺，可他们一年到头很少回来，俺心里空落落的。俺捡破烂儿并不全是为着卖钱，就是有事可做，心里踏实。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;四是基于被关注，渴望短暂的小幸福。朋友跟我闲聊时，提及他家亲戚、住在城区的李婆婆捡垃圾的原因与众不同。她的老院子平时少有人来，只有过节过年时儿孙们才团聚，欢声笑语溢满了不大的院落，那是李婆婆一年之中最幸福最快乐的几天。后来，李婆婆发现，只要家里乱了，儿女们也会来打扫，于是她灵机一动，故意捡来垃圾，故意把院子搞乱搞脏，这样孩子们就会回来收拾，家里就添了人气生气，热热闹闹的了。两个儿媳看不惯她这种做派，说李婆婆有点精神不正常。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;老年人热衷囤积破烂儿，不仅有碍观瞻，影响家庭环境卫生，更主要的是老人的心理健康或多或少出现了问题。作为子女，不仅要经常清理打扫，规劝安慰，使其回归正常的生活轨道，还应从深层次上找原因。常言道：解铃还须系铃人。子女不仅要重视物质方面的赡养，更应注重精神赡养，就像老歌《常回家看看》里所唱的，“找点空闲，找点时间，领着孩子，常回家看看；带上笑容，带上祝愿，陪同爱人，常回家看看……”多给老人精神上的安慰，让他们感受浓浓亲情和家的温暖，某种程度上来说，这比单纯给以丰厚的物质赡养更为重要！&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wu Kangren has no agent or company. He entered the industry late and had 50 jobs before becoming an actor. work. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of tvbs)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Kangren&#39;s voice came from the other end of the receiver. Like an old-fashioned man, he carefully confirmed the name of the newspaper and the reporter&#39;s name, and his tone sounded gentle and gentle. He is on vacation. When he is not working, he spends his time in the same way as ordinary people. He passes the time by watching anime such as &quot;Spells Come Back&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years, Wu Kangren may have been the actor with the broadest role map in the Chinese-language drama market. His images in movies and TV shows are so varied that it&#39;s jaw-dropping. In 2021, he dressed up in women&#39;s clothing, put on lipstick, and played the role of Mama Sang &quot;Baby&quot; in the highly acclaimed drama &quot;The Lights Are Coming&quot;. The character photo was published in Taiwanese newspapers, but no one reacted, &quot;It took two days to be discovered by others. Isn&#39;t this Wu Kangren!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 2022 drama &quot;Her and Her Her&quot;, he plays A pervert who is sexually harassed in the workplace has a female fan who is so angry that she wants to &quot;quit her fans&quot;. Wu Kangren is very calm about this. He told Southern Weekend reporters that he is not worried about the loss of fans of the drama and movies. &quot;The next role will be different.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These roles are a huge departure from the &quot;flower boy&quot; image he played early in his career. At the age of 27, he played Hana Takuya in the classic idol drama &quot;Next Stop, Happiness&quot; - affectionate, broken, and in line with all the settings of a tragic male lead. But in the following years, he continued to break away from that image full of romantic arcs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, on the 54th Taiwan Golden Bell Awards stage, Wu Kangren took the stage as the award guest. Everyone looked at the thin actor with sunken cheeks and a bald head with some suspicion. &quot;Isn&#39;t this a bald man?&quot; A barrage floated across the video. At that time, for the new drama, he lost weight to only 64 kilograms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It has become routine for him to adjust his body shape, skin color and accent according to the requirements of the role. Someone made an Excel polyline table of Wu Kangren&#39;s weight data from &quot;Termites&quot; to &quot;Love&quot; and found that his weight suddenly went up and down, showing a steep W shape. A reporter from Southern Weekend asked him if he was not afraid of physical damage caused by drastic changes? He smiled and replied: &quot;I&#39;m still alive.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Fight&quot; is the key word that many people first think of when they mention Wu Kangren. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2023, Wu Kangren changed his appearance again in the Taiwanese drama &quot;In This Lifetime&quot; broadcast exclusively on Station B. He put on a Hawaiian shirt, revealing his dark skin, and became the 41-year-old frustrated middle-aged Gao Jiayue. As the eldest son in his family, he has been drifting away for a long time, running a restaurant named &quot;One Million&quot; with a rating of only 2.8 in Xiaoliuqiu. After several years of bleak business, his girlfriend couldn&#39;t bear the island life and cheated on him and left. His career went bankrupt, his love failed, and he tried to hang himself in a restaurant, but the rope broke. Dive to the bottom of the sea, take off your oxygen equipment, and prepare to drown yourself. He suddenly remembered that the oxygen equipment might be eaten by sea turtles and was not environmentally friendly, so he had no choice but to surface and returned home dejectedly to meet his family and have a &quot;long farewell.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My parents ran a breakfast shop in Taipei to support their three sons. The mother struggled to endure her father&#39;s mental infidelity and continued to live under the same roof with resentment. The second son is an adopted son. He lives a regular life as an office worker and takes the initiative to take over the responsibility of taking care of his parents. The younger son is older and unmarried, and helps in the breakfast shop. The whole family is stuck in the inertia of the old life and is stuck in moving forward. Everyone is in a &quot;stuck moment&quot; in life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Kangren said that he doesn’t have much in common with the character, but as a peer of Gao Jiayue, he has also experienced Kaka moments in real life. &quot;What&#39;s the hardest time for an actor? The role you want to take is taken away, or people don&#39;t like your good performance when it comes out.&quot; Wu Kangren told a reporter from Southern Weekend. His response was simple and clear: keep eating, sleeping, and trying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023 will be a harvest year for Wu Kangren. Two of his films, &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; and &quot;May You Live Forever&quot; were screened at the film festival. Both films focused on the bottom class. &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; was filmed in Malaysia, with Wu Kangren playing a deaf-mute illegal immigrant. After getting off the plane, he intuitively felt the gap between him and the character. At first glance, he was a &quot;white and clean civilized person&quot;, while the character he played lived in a dirty place all day long. He began to starve and continued to bask in the sun until his skin was tanned by ultraviolet rays and the locals in the market stopped looking at him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the 2023 First Youth Film Festival, he won the best actor for this role. The organizing committee commented on his performance: &quot;Faced with unconventional character settings, Wu Kangren used all available physical resources such as expressions, body parts, movements, and eyes to perform, interpreting the emotions and emotions of the film extremely vividly. Hearing thunder in silence reflects the actor&#39;s great empathy for the character&#39;s situation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Kangren has a rare sense of relaxation. He has no agent or company and works for himself. Lasted nine years. There are no personal restrictions or team control. It&#39;s all up to you to decide what kind of scenes to take on, what roles to play, how much to talk to the media, and what the standards are. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He asked a Southern Weekend reporter which episode of &quot;In This Lifetime&quot; he had watched. After getting the answer, he conveyed his preferences as if he were a friend: &quot;Look further down, the back is really better. I really like it.&quot; I like it.&quot; Faced with the reporter&#39;s &quot;problematic&quot; question, he also bluntly said: &quot;This question is too broad.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the outside world, the different types of roles over the years have brought Wu Kangren Emboldened. But he said that when he was young, his sense of self-identity was very low and he felt that he was just a &quot;nobody&quot;. He entered the industry late and had 50 jobs before the age of 20. He worked as a rough laborer on construction sites, ran a street stall, and also worked in cafes and bars. Now that I am in my forties this year, the feeling of insecurity has subsided, and new questions have arisen in my heart. He said that in recent years, he feels that his life as an actor will not be too long, so he cherishes it more and increases the frequency of taking roles. This year, he has at least seven film and television works released. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the interview, he almost subconsciously revealed his expectations for his subsequent career. He said: &quot;I want to continue acting until I am old.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http: //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/iNugJUjNXgJjxodcmTCYsmf9VQCWG6XI7zrO9Neb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;519&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/iNugJUjNXgJjxodcmTCYsmf9VQCWG6XI7zrO9Neb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255555&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In &quot; In &quot;In This Lifetime&quot;, Wu Kangren plays Gao Jiayue, a frustrated middle-aged man. After his career went bankrupt and his love failed, he tried to commit suicide but failed and returned home in despair. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of tvbs)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In early October 2023, Wu Kangren accepted an exclusive interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend. The following is a self-narration compiled based on the interview content:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;It would be good to grow this big in my lifetime&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After receiving the invitation from &quot;In This Lifetime&quot; At that time, I had just finished filming the movie &quot;May You Live Longer&quot; in Hong Kong. When I finished filming, I only weighed 53 kilograms, which was too light. So before joining the set of &quot;In This Life Time&quot;, I ate as much as possible and weighed 66 kilograms when I returned. Last year I went to Malaysia and Hong Kong to shoot a movie respectively. I was made thin and dark. I came back to play the role of Gao Jiayue, a kid who came back from the island. In fact, he looked quite similar. In addition, director Xu Zhaoren is here, and I also like the script. I knew beforehand that Brother Xixiang (Xi Xiang, who plays the father) and Sister Guimei (Yang Guimei, who plays the mother) would take the role, so I also wanted to act together in it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The director took the sad story very lightly, and made the sad things somewhat funny, even humorous. Gao Jiayue is a person who really wants to die. But if you take what Gao Jiayue said to his nephew, &quot;I jumped into the sea, I wanted to die, but I saw turtles again, and I was afraid that the turtles would eat my equipment and it was not environmentally friendly.&quot; People say that he must think you are lying or joking. But when the audience actually saw the picture, all this became no longer such a joke: it was true, he wanted to die. I think this is where life is ridiculous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In My Lifetime&quot; is not about university knowledge. My own interpretation is, &quot;It would be good to grow this big in your lifetime.&quot; This sentence reflects a lot of feelings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When things don’t go as planned, it’s always a “stuck moment.” In our lives, sometimes things go against our expectations, and sometimes hard work may not necessarily pay off. This is a very cruel thing. You can’t get what you want, and you can get what you don’t want. How you can stabilize your mood, continue to live, continue to love the people around you, or make the people you love live happily is all a matter of subject. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people choose to escape, such as the parents in the play who have marital problems. Gao Jiayue came back to tell them not to continue evading. Some people tried to persuade them to make peace but not to leave. Gao Jiayue tried to persuade them to leave but not to make peace. Some people are always in his comfort zone, such as his two younger brothers, who complain about life but are unwilling to step out. How can a character like Gao Jiayue push them, but in such an annoying way? He has the courage to be hated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Real-life family dramas are not as easy as genre dramas. It is very difficult to act in a very real-life way. We actors have been acting for so long and are very familiar with rhythm, technique, and movement. We are also very familiar with how to perform well on camera. But when we try too hard to show the good side, the sense of drama will be stronger and the audience can see it. Xu Zhaoren hopes to adapt it to life, so we revised the lines in the direction of life. Chatting with the director and imagining the characters every day before going on stage is actually very brain-burning and tiring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The script of &quot;In This Lifetime&quot; is very well structured, and the relationship between everyone is clearly written. But we didn’t act according to the relationship between everyone in the script. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We feel that we have put a lot of effort into it. In fact, at that time, I was so thin that I deliberately imitated Brother Xixiang. Since I wanted to play his son, did I have any similarities with him? We looked at his posture and sometimes imitated him in jumping and sitting. At that time, I had a lot of discussions with the director. Since you want to play a son and a brother, do you have the same attitude towards each family member, or is it a little different? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, when you are getting along with your younger brother, you just love to bully him. How to bully him? The screenwriter will not teach you to hit them with your hands in the play. This kind of action must be designed by yourself. And it has to be connected to when you were a kid. The second brother in the play is not your biological brother. Your attitude towards your biological brother (reporter&#39;s note: third brother) may be different from that of the second brother. In fact, it is very subtle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, the relationship with his father was not good in the script, but in fact when we acted it out, Brother Xixiang felt that he loved his eldest son the most because he was his first son. Child. It is a very straightforward way for parents to express their love for you verbally. Brother Xixiang’s method is the kind of love in which he scolds you the harshest and hits you the hardest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The original way of quarreling with my father was to talk to each other, but now as the show continues, it has become that I can actually have a good chat with my father. You are a rebellious son, but you are always unwilling to take what adults say seriously, which means we are acting the other way around. So in the first episode at the beginning, the father guarded the drunk Gao Jiayue from getting up, saying that he was afraid that you would spit it out and choke to death. Therefore, the relationship between Gao Jiayue and his father was not a quarrel at the beginning, but a show of weakness, that is, I was homesick and came back to see it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the script, there is no drinking in the scene of returning home. We discussed with the director and couldn&#39;t imagine what kind of state Gao Jiayue was in before he dared to step into this home again. A failed person, a person who is unwilling to start over, a person who dares not face himself again, but is so arrogant and thinks that I will succeed when I go out to start a business, and then returns to this home penniless, at this time, what should I do? How to do it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So what I thought of was, otherwise we would have a drink, and he would have to get himself drunk before he dared to return to this house shamelessly. In the end we decided to use this method. How on earth would he face the truth? You can only get yourself drunk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In that scene, I really drank sorghum wine. I&#39;m not that good at drinking, but I drank in a situation that I could control. After filming, I fell asleep, and the actors called it a day, leaving me alone on set. When I woke up, the only thing left was the lighting crew taking out the lights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/3ijT0Y9zockqo3BFBZxZtn4NO0EUMTVl8Cf8Zc2C.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;519&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/3ijT0Y9zockqo3BFBZxZtn4NO0EUMTVl8Cf8Zc2C.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255556&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In recent years, Wu Kangren&#39;s film and television image has been very varied, and he has played many impressive supporting roles. In 2023, he will have at least seven film and television works released. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of tvbs)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;At that time, I only wanted to take supporting roles&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>;In recent years, Taiwanese dramas have become more varied in genre. Since they are so varied, of course actors have the opportunity to be varied. They just complement each other, from early idol dramas to later craftsman dramas, police and gangster movies, ghost movies, and now back to life. It&#39;s a big test for actors. You can&#39;t use your past skills to perform every play. When you encounter different plays, you have to make different adjustments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have no particular pursuit to play various types of characters, I just want to accumulate different acting experiences. It should be said that I think the life of an actor will not be too long. I dare not say that for everyone. I think it is a question mark in my mind how long an actor can act. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was in my early 30s, I began to realize this, which may have something to do with my upbringing. In the past, my self-identity was not so high. The so-called self-identity refers to self-confidence and even the value of existence. You may feel that you are just a nobody, a child who grew up on a construction site. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was young, I really felt that I could only work hard, otherwise what would I do? That’s why I got so many roles later. The reason I take on so many roles is not because I want to make a lot of money. In Taiwan, I can’t make much money from film remuneration. I hope that within a limited time, I can see my own possibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So after I turned 35, I started to play different roles quite quickly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;She and Her Her&quot;, &quot;The Lights Come on&quot; and &quot;Mom, stop making trouble!&quot; ” were probably all filmed at the same time, and during that time I only wanted to take on supporting roles. Because I think the burden of the protagonist is too heavy. The protagonist sometimes shoots for three or four months at a time. He is always immersed in a role or a long period of work. He is very tired and easily tired. I might as well play a supporting role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the epidemic was also going on at that time, I felt that filming supporting roles could be more fun and not be so stressful. You may say it&#39;s good to have more fun, but I have also reviewed it myself and found that those characters were really overplayed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Her and Her Her&quot; was a guest appearance to help, and I didn&#39;t think too much about it, because the role had to be played in a perverted way. I remember that the producer and director couldn&#39;t find anyone at that time, so they called me later. I had some friendship with the producer, so I went to help. I didn&#39;t want to attract everyone&#39;s attention, I just went to serve, serve. That role. I&#39;m not worried about losing the audience. The next role will be different. I&#39;ve never worried about it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The First Light&quot; is another story. It was really because of good luck. I had a good role as the &quot;baby&quot; and he had a lot of space. He found me only after the filming started. I was free at that time and even Director Yi Qi asked you to act, and I said yes. I said you have to give me time to prepare, because I need to find a teacher to practice high heels and dance. In fact, we prepared everything in private, chatting with those drag queens, eating and drinking with them, and imitating their looks and voices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So sometimes taking a role is not so calculated, sometimes it’s just a feeling, because the director is right, I go because the script is right, I go because there are certain actors, or I feel that If it helps this drama, I will do it. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;When you are not acting, you are just a nobody&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;In This Lifetime&quot; has helped me a lot in my life. I&#39;m really lucky to be able to film &quot;In This Life Time&quot; at this age. Xu Zhaoren is a very good director, and it is very difficult to perform his scenes well. It was the third time I worked with him that this time I seriously felt that I might actually have done a good job. In the past, I didn&#39;t feel like I was able to add points to his dramas, but this drama did a little bit, and I felt like I was finally worthy of him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Actually, I take myself very seriously. Sometimes the success of a drama is the result of the team, sometimes it is the credit of the marketing, and sometimes it is the accumulation of credits between the characters. It is absolutely impossible to do it because of one person. Man, this drama is hit or miss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have always been confident in my life as an actor. The so-called confidence means that I am willing to do it, not that I am very good. This is a concept. In the past, it was a very simple and clear thing to work hard and be rewarded. This thing has a profound impact on me. If you work, work hard, and sweat for the construction site, you will get the salary you deserve. This is a must-have condition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And be responsible. You really have to do your job well, otherwise the boss will scold you, fire you, or ask you to pack up and leave. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Acting is the same for me. Sometimes why you are so fat and why you are so thin is because no one has done it, and no one knows what can be gained from it. I want to know what I can gain from the state of mind of being hungry or obese. I think this is irreplaceable and is self-cultivation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s hard for you to tell others that I was hungry for 4 months from May to August last year. From &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; to &quot;May I Live Longer&quot;, I lost 53 kilograms. I was so hungry. , how I lived. People just say, wow. But it’s not because my character has to be so thin that you can see how great I am, no. It’s about putting the characters there and seeing the finished product in the end. Even if the movie doesn&#39;t go well, people will think you&#39;re just thin, so what&#39;s the big deal? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because you will really experience it after you do it. We are not like the protagonist of the anime. Why is he almost defeated in the end and still able to wake up? Because he thinks about his family and friends. Like Luffy in &quot;One Piece&quot; and Goku in &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, he suddenly doesn&#39;t know where he came from. strength. We are human beings, and we still have our own limits. Limits can only be reached through self-examination again and again. If people don&#39;t make mistakes, they won&#39;t know that they will make mistakes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was acting, I often made mistakes, and I still make them now. It&#39;s just that sometimes someone will correct your mistakes, sometimes not, but I always hope to meet a director who can deny you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development of each actor is different. Some talented actors need to retain their energy. I consider myself to be mediocre and I need to accumulate that energy. The growth process of each actor cannot be compared. Since it cannot be compared, there is no repetition. The lack of repetition means that only I understand what I am going through, and you will not understand. Only after each finished product comes out will you see the difference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When an actor is not acting, you are just a nobody. At most, you will be exposed to fashion or commercial performances, and you will see the glamorous star appearance. In fact, if you take away those appearances, who you really are is very vague. Celebrities have a popular persona, and that persona is the persona that the audience likes, because now everyone likes to see good things, kind people, and even people with high moral standards. The actor&#39;s appearance is very blurry, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with being blurry, it&#39;s just a different experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have always felt that actors are people living in the past, and the works you see are all me from the past. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Acting has never been free&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Actually, I have always felt that my work experience, having worked 50 jobs before I was 20, was not of much help to me. big. The accumulation of work experience is very life-like, but sometimes drama does not require you to perform life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, &quot;Copycat&quot;. It is a genre drama, and genre dramas are not life-like. If you want to stick to a life-like performance and conform to the rhythm of the camera and the director, when should you react? This is the pull between you and yourself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Playing Guo Xiaoqi in &quot;Copycat&quot; was very difficult for me, very difficult, extremely difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The skeleton of the genre drama is better written, but the portrayal of the characters may not be outstanding. Because it serves a crime and captures the real culprit, it takes the audience to see the reaction of each character. After watching it, the protagonist is actually empty. The so-called empty means that you can only accumulate some plots to serve the audience. How to put your own human flavor into it requires a lot of thinking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, you want to play him very smart, but you don’t want to play him too handsome, a little quirky, but you don’t want to make him too mythical. If you just look at the ferocity of the supporting characters, the main character will easily disappear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If &quot;Copycat&quot; is about using all the things accumulated in the past into one film, &quot;In This Lifetime&quot; is about forgetting all the things that I know. This is a transition between very skillful and unskillful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Acting has never been free. How can acting be free? Acting is very scientific, including lenses, camera positions, performances, types, and even opponents. Acting is very unfree but very organic. Any situation may affect the whole body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called lack of freedom is that you cannot perform exactly the way you want, sometimes because of the orientation of the camera, sometimes because of the rhythm, sometimes because of the opponent actor, and sometimes because of what the character wants to present. situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why do you think you have to take on so many roles? Because I think acting is a very passive profession, I just hope to put some of my own initiative into acting work in a passive situation as much as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The passivity of an actor is to be chosen. You will be there only after the script is written. If the script is not written, you will not exist. You may just act in another play. What space is there to be able to choose and take the initiative? That means to become thinner or fatter, to make the character more internal or more external, it doesn&#39;t matter. No matter what method you use, show your initiative. Those initiatives will affect the director&#39;s thoughts on the character, or the character can have a chemical reaction with other actors. This is the initiative that I think is valuable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s what acting is, you bring out your own life experience. If you don&#39;t have this life experience, you need to rely on a lot of field research and investment. Except for a few who can&#39;t do it, others can rely on self-study and hard work to accumulate the short one or two seconds on the screen to deceive everyone and say that I look like me. But when you go deeper, whether the performance is good or bad depends on each actor&#39;s own interpretation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, I like many senior actors, such as Mr. Li Xuejian from Mainland China, who can act at that age, or Mr. Jin Shijie, etc. Actors who grew up in Hong Kong in the 1980s and 1990s, such as Tony Leung Ka Fai, Tony Leung Chiu Wai, Nick Cheung Ka Fai, and Andy Lau, each actor has accumulated hundreds of dramas, leaving his own place. But for me, that kind of accumulation is very difficult. If I follow the current pace of actors, I will never be able to achieve it. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Nine years without an agent&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;I haven’t had an agent for about nine years. In the early years, I was still looking for one, but because of one job after another Come, I will keep acting. If there is a job, I will take it, if I get it, I will act, and if I act, I will go on stage. If someone says hello, I will applaud. I will say thank you, and I will keep acting like this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After four or five years, it seems that people (agents) no longer come to me. They seem to think that I can do this. But in fact, I am very busy and have many things to deal with, including contracts and work. Time, schedule. I haven&#39;t taken on so many commercial projects, and shooting commercials isn&#39;t too complicated. Relatively speaking, my acting life is pretty simple. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back now, I feel that every decision I made before was good. I did not sign for a big company, but signed for a small company, and I will live a happier life. Later, he left the protection of his original agent, and finally became an agent by himself for no apparent reason. I also have to be an assistant and carry my own bag, which contains travel supplies and stomach medicine. Be your own driver and drive to the scene, finish work by yourself, and borrow clothes by yourself. There are things to do and things not to do. There are some jobs that you can choose, and there are some jobs where you don’t have to make this money. If you don’t make this money, you won’t have so many burdens and baggage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am an actor, and what we talk about is what actors do. In fact, I rarely talk about conditions, because if you talk about conditions, it will be complicated and waste a lot of thought. Being able to act well is the first condition. I&#39;m not a person who likes to compare. I don&#39;t compare myself to actors of the same age and tell them what they are like. If you don&#39;t think about it, nothing will happen. If you think about it, something will happen. You feel you are at a disadvantage because you have a value standard and judgment: my salary must be so high, or my conditions must be so high. If you don&#39;t have this value standard, there is no such thing as suffering a loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, last year&#39;s &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; and &quot;May You Live Forever&quot; were both very low-cost movies, so why were they filmed? Because I like the script of &quot;Fudu Youth&quot;, I want to try to go out and experience life. Different environments will have different sparks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I did go, it was very worthwhile, and I made a great movie. &quot;May I Live Longer&quot; is from Hong Kong, so it&#39;s the same. I just read the script and said I would go. I didn’t talk about where I would live, and I didn’t even talk about my salary. The producer was surprised and said, &quot;Don&#39;t you ask about the price?&quot; I said I don’t need to ask about the price, just call the contract. He called over the contract and it was this price. I laughed. I know they don&#39;t have money. If I think I can accept it, I will go, and I will be very happy in my heart, and you will be very relaxed, because you have nothing to ask for, so you will go, just asking for a good performance in the play. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 2015 to now, I don’t want everyone to think that because my life has become easier, I am not willing to make progress. I also hope to accumulate something. At least the stuff coming out this year is above the level, and I don’t want to deal with the performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s hard to say fate. It’s unlikely that you will have a breakthrough in every drama, really. This is a market. To survive in this market, we can only rely on each drama and how to play the role well after joining. In fact, there is not much that actors can do. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[清远一所学校七百多名新生退学，官方回应]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259407]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-26 18:48:03&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In response to Qingyuan Desheng Health Vocational and Technical School’s blind expansion of enrollment in the fall semester of 2023 without approval and replacement with online courses In the case of face-to-face teaching, the Qingyuan Municipal Education Bureau has set up a city and county joint working group to station in the school, ordering the school to actively respond to the concerns of students and parents, conscientiously rectify problems, effectively safeguard students&#39; legitimate rights and interests, and ensure normal education and teaching order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qingyuan Desheng Health Vocational and Technical School is a private secondary vocational school with 3,981 students currently enrolled (including: 1,215 in the 2021 grade, 837 in the 2022 grade, and 1,929 in the 2023 grade). After a preliminary investigation, it was found that the school expanded its enrollment without authorization, resulting in insufficient teaching staff and an inability to meet teaching needs, resulting in online classes replacing face-to-face classes. After supervision by the working group, the new teachers recruited by the school for the autumn semester have been gradually put in place, which basically meets the teaching needs. The online teaching problems have been rectified and the education and teaching order is normal. At present, the school has fully refunded the fees to 730 students who dropped out. The Qingyuan Municipal Education Bureau guided the school to handle the registration and filing of student status for the 2023 freshmen in accordance with regulations, and urged the school to strengthen teacher training and management to ensure teaching quality. At the same time, in order to ensure that students can transfer to other schools in a timely manner, the Qingyuan Municipal Education Bureau provides information on secondary vocational (technical) schools with surplus places in the city for students who have dropped out to apply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the next step, the Qingyuan Municipal Education Bureau will urge the school to speed up the implementation of rectifications and run the school in accordance with the law and regulations. At the same time, an investigation will be launched into the school’s illegal enrollment expansion in the fall semester of 2023 and will be dealt with seriously in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qingyuan Municipal Education Bureau&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;October 26, 2023&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
