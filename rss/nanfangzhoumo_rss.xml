The feeling of being worse spans time and geography and is a common social phenomenon that can even be traced back to more than 2,000 years ago. If such a feeling is real and accurate, it may mean that human moral standards have been steadily declining and reaching new lows for thousands of years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But there is also another possibility, that is, the general moral decay and declining social order are just people&#39;s illusions. There is a certain pattern behind it that causes people in different eras and different regions to always have such similar feelings. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, researchers from Columbia University and Harvard University used more than 12 million related scientific data to verify people&#39;s views on moral development trends. The results found that the subjective feeling of &quot;the world is declining&quot; is indeed not an individual time. , a phenomenon that occurs in individual places, but is extremely universal. However, through more objective comparisons of survey data over decades, researchers are also convinced that these subjective feelings of &quot;the present is not as good as it used to be&quot; are actually an illusion. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Universal and lasting feeling&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This study was published in the magazine &quot;Nature&quot; in June 2023 and relied on data from recent times around the world. Sixty countries and a time span of more than 70 years. Through these horizontal and vertical comparisons, the elders have a more scientific explanation for the criticism of young people that &quot;one generation is inferior to the other&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For most people, morality mainly refers to the way people treat other people in daily life, such as whether they are honest, polite or even willing to help others, etc. The researchers used a series of survey data dating back to the 1940s to understand people&#39;s attitudes toward moral changes. The surveys included direct questions about trends, such as “Do you feel our society’s integrity and ethical behavior have changed more, less, or the same over the past few decades?” “Now do you feel the moral values ​​of the country as a whole have changed?” Better or worse?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The results show that in more than 80% of the survey items, most people believe that the moral level of the entire society is declining. Specifically, people are more likely to experience moral decline when the comparison period is longer. For example, when comparing the longer period of the past ten years to the past year, people are more likely to feel that the level of social morality is declining. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In some recent surveys, researchers have also found that age is also an important factor in how people feel. People will feel that people today are less friendly and less sincere than the people they saw when they were 20 years old. Similarly, they will also feel that the people they saw at 20 years old are not as moral as the people they were born in. And overall, older people feel more morally bankrupt than younger people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But has social morality really been declining? Some more concrete and objective investigation shows that this is not the case. In addition to asking people generally about their feelings about moral changes, decades of survey data include direct questions about a wide range of people&#39;s specific moral behaviors. For example, &quot;Were you respected by the people around you yesterday?&quot; &quot;In the past 12 months, how often did you give up your seat to strangers, give directions, look after things, or lend money to others?&quot; The results of a number of surveys on specific moral behaviors are clear. By comparing people&#39;s records of their own and their peers&#39; moral behaviors in different eras, the moral level is actually relatively stable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even when evaluating some specific social and moral issues, people may feel moral improvement. For example, when the survey asked about how to treat people with disabilities and sexual minorities, many people believed that society was making progress. These data all show that although when people generally evaluate social moral changes, they will feel from the bottom of their hearts that morality has been declining or even getting worse. However, by comparing relatively more objective specific moral behaviors, the subjective judgment of moral decline cannot be held up. foot. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Happier and more ethical&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“I do often hear people say that people are becoming more and more selfish and less generous. Etc. I hear this statement both from the public and other academics. However, I always point out that the data shows this is not true. This latest study is very convincing and I agree with the author, though Many people feel that this is the case, but there is no objective evidence that moral standards are actually declining.&quot; Abigail Marsh, a professor in the Department of Psychology at Georgetown University, told Southern Weekend reporters that some of her own research shows that , some forms of altruistic behavior are actually on the rise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, she collaborated with researchers from the Department of Psychology at Harvard University and other institutions to conduct a summary analysis of survey data on altruistic behavior in a large number of countries. The results found that a country’s altruistic behavior is related to the subjective happiness of local people. There is a positive correlation. When the material resources and cultural value of a place support people from both objective and subjective conditions, and people feel happier, altruistic behavior will also increase. Moreover, the more individualistic values ​​prevail in places, the greater this effect will be. obvious. Relevant research was published in Psychological Science, and similar conclusions were also included in the latest edition of the 2023 World Happiness Report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Some data suggest that altruistic behavior, especially toward distant strangers, generally increases over time. This may be because happiness increases, and as happiness increases Altruistic behavior appears to be increasing as well. These studies also show that around the world, where subjective well-being is higher, there are also higher levels of various altruistic and generous behaviors, such as being more likely to donate to charity and volunteer. Serve, help strangers, donate blood, donate organs and bone marrow, and treat animals humanely.&quot; Of course, ethics is more than selflessness and generosity, but these are important components of ethics, Abigail Marsh explains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The findings of the latest research highlight this paradox about morality. On the one hand, human society has been developing in terms of material and spiritual culture, and there is no reasonable explanation for the continued decline in morality. On the other hand, there are differences in the level of development, cultural traditions, and people&#39;s happiness in various places. Under such circumstances, the widespread moral decay is even more unreasonable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After analysis, Columbia University psychologist Adam M. Mastroianni and Harvard University psychology professor Daniel T. Gilbert, who participated in the latest study, believe , two common psychological laws may explain this strange social phenomenon. One is an attention bias and the other is a memory bias. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Psychological biases that are prone to occur&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;A large number of psychological studies have found that humans are fascinated by negative information about others and always tend to search for and pay attention to negative information. It&#39;s such a good thing that negative information in the mass media has received more attention. This creates an attention bias. When recalling past events, people tend to forget those bad experiences and are more likely to remember some good memories, showing a memory bias. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this way, when people look at the current society, they may pay more attention to the dark side of society, including immoral people and things. When comparing the past, it is easier to remember the good people and good deeds and forget the immoral behavior, thus feeling that the world is deteriorating and people&#39;s hearts are not as old as before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to verify the influence of these two psychological effects, the researchers also changed the participants&#39; attention through experiments, asking them to focus on familiar people such as family and friends in their social circle. The results were obvious. Double answer. People believe that the moral level of people in society as a whole is declining, but the moral level of their acquaintances and relatives has not only not declined, but has improved. Similarly, when people put aside the influence of memory bias and compared two eras that they had never experienced, the phenomenon of moral decline also disappeared. Generally speaking, people believe that the moral decay of society begins when they are born. These different answers are indeed intriguing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it should be noted that there are still some limitations to the latest research, including inaccuracies in historical data measurements. The combined effect of attention and memory biases is only an explanation that the latest research attempts to give, and it is not enough to scientifically prove the reason behind the phenomenon of moral turpitude illusion. People all over the world, both ancient and modern, lament the deterioration of society. There may be other reasons behind this social phenomenon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, some scientists have indeed given slightly different explanations before. Researchers from the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at the University of California, Santa Barbara believe that personal characteristics play an important role in this phenomenon. In real life, a considerable part of the scenes of lamenting the deterioration of society and moral decline are caused by the elders blaming the younger ones. In the eyes of these elders, today&#39;s children are incomparable to them in the past and have lost many beautiful moral qualities. Research has found that in such accusations, elders can easily form a series of biased opinions based on personal characteristics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, if you are good at something, you will be more likely to focus on other people&#39;s shortcomings in this aspect; if you have advantages or preferences in a certain aspect, you will assume that everyone was like this when you were a child. This self-centered attention bias and memory bias may have given rise to the impression that &quot;one generation is inferior to the other&quot;. In this impression, the shortcomings of young people are so glaring, and the qualities that everyone in the older generation has now been lost. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Difficulties in changing moral behavior&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;These discussions on moral changes also reflect the complexity of moral issues themselves. In 2019, Jenae M. Neiderhiser, a professor in the Department of Psychology at Pennsylvania State University, and others analyzed the moral development of children in a large number of families and found that moral quality is not entirely determined by the upbringing environment, but rather There are also genetic influences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The study, which lasted for nearly ten years, focused on two moral indicators: social responsibility in adolescents and responsibility in early adulthood. Because it also included twins of all types and brothers and sisters in recombined families, it was possible to compare genetics and The role of environmental factors in moral development. Research shows that genetic factors and the upbringing environment provided by parents jointly shape children&#39;s moral character in the early stages of adolescent growth, but after adulthood, the role of parental upbringing weakens. Relevant research was published in Behavior Genetics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of Professor Abigail Marsh, who has long studied altruistic behavior, moral behavior also has a physiological basis. Compared with the law of survival of the fittest driven by selfishness, altruists are willing to help others even if their own interests are harmed. This is a unique problem from the perspective of evolutionary theory. Abigail Marsh and others have used magnetic resonance imaging to study the brains of a group of extraordinary altruists and found that these people who are willing to donate kidneys to strangers can be identified by characteristics such as an increase in the size of the right amygdala. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;People often refer to these extraordinary altruists who are willing to risk themselves to help others as &#39;patron saints&#39; or &#39;saints.&#39; But our research suggests that biological phenomena may help explain why some People engage in extraordinary altruistic behavior. This may be because they have specific neurological and cognitive characteristics that make them more concerned about the well-being of others than the average person.&quot; Abigail, who is also a professor in the Interdisciplinary Program in Neuroscience at Georgetown University Marsh told Southern Weekend reporters that morality is fundamentally about weighing the consequences of oneself and others in behavior, and a series of studies have shown that there are biological differences behind some people choosing to value the happiness of others more. &quot;The brain is designed to learn and adapt. In general, I believe that people help others based on their true values ​​and that they genuinely care about the well-being of others. If people generally become more selfless over time, then It must be because we have learned to value the happiness of others more. What we don’t quite understand, however, is how to increase the importance one attaches to the happiness of others in some targeted way.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This It also means that understanding and changing moral behavior itself may be more difficult than the common delusion of moral decay. More importantly, for the real society, if people in a society have formed a consensus of moral decay and believe that the social moral level is declining, then both the direction of public policy and the development of interpersonal behavior will have a negative impact. produce a negative impact. After all, a society with a declining moral level contains the motivation to restore tradition and return to the past in the public arena, which may trigger a series of socially regressive behaviors. And once people believe that the world is in decline, the way of interpersonal communication may also develop in the direction of mutual distrust. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, many psychological surveys have found that because they underestimate the kindness of strangers, people are more hesitant to ask strangers for help, and they are less afraid to take the initiative to say hello to strangers. This interpersonal environment of mutual distrust has greatly affected people&#39;s happiness and sense of belonging to society. The illusion of a declining social moral level may be one of the reasons for this phenomenon. What’s even more frightening is that people are often very sensitive to changes in social norms and behavioral norms. Once they make a mistake in judgment, it may lead to truly unethical behavior in the subtle process. These highlight the significance of a correct understanding of this illusion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 07 Oct 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[魏明毅：“像个男人”的要求如何伤害男人]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257976]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-07 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/27/OPKkXxVazmd4ofE5r7XLw1SjL9BW1KszkfaehUff.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/OPKkXxVazmd4ofE5r7XLw1SjL9BW1 KszkfaehUff. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252415&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wei Mingyi, writer and psychological counselor, has been engaged in psychological counseling and supervision for decades. Author of &quot;Silent Worker: Days and Nights at the Dock&quot; and &quot;Reflections of Suffering: Field Notes of a Suffering Worker&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023 At 11:20 in the morning at the end of August, 53-year-old Taiwanese psychological counselor Wei Mingyi appeared in the video, an hour later than the agreed time. She quickly apologized and explained that when she was helping colleagues at the placement agency in class in the morning, a child with visual limitations suddenly picked up a fruit knife, and she delayed the interview while dealing with this matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I told the child that you must have encountered something. Please tell the teacher and we will discuss it together. Put down the knife first, and then we can talk about it.&quot; The crisis was quickly resolved. Every once in a while, Wei Mingyi will go to the resettlement agency to teach colleagues to help children who have been improperly disciplined by their parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her new book &quot;Reflections of Suffering: Field Memos of a Suffering Worker&quot; published in March 2023 &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Reflections of Suffering&quot;)&lt;/span>;Some chapters are also about this kind of children, &quot;They may not be very smart and have great difficulty solving problems. I don&#39;t look at them from the perspective of illness. Usually, People will interact with the outside world in a worse way after being treated inappropriately by the people around them. As long as they are treated in an appropriate way, they can return to their original appearance.&quot; Wei Mingyi sat in front of the screen and talked about this again Eyes red. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This was probably the inertial outlet behind years of emotional labor. She was not surprised that she shed tears. In 2016, she completed her field record at the Keelung Pier, &quot;Silent Workers: Days and Nights at the Pier&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (the simplified Chinese version will be published in 2022) &lt;/span>;, she would cry when participating in new book sharing and interviews, &quot;I vaguely feel that I am suffering. I still like to work, but why is the heavy feeling still very big.&quot; When she repeatedly talks about the suffering of others, suffering also becomes Her own. The publishing house later simply prepared the paper for her in advance, &quot;because she knew Mingyi would cry in the next scene.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a last resort, she turned down all job offers and flew to a strange country to walk every day. &quot;At that time Only walking makes me comfortable.&quot; Day after day, she found that the suffering she witnessed in the anthropological field gradually became her flesh and blood, which happened to be an opportunity for her to write her second book &quot;Reflections of Suffering&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Reflections of Suffering&quot; is a collection of her more than 20 years of work experience in psychological counseling and social supervision. In it, she writes about her brother who killed his sister due to a dispute over a game, and how she gave birth to a son who had incest with his father and was killed by his family. She happily accepts underage girls, violent women, and men who kill their wives... It has been seven years since her last book was published. During this period, she was still working as a psychological counselor and was used to the continuous daily consultation. I hope that my busy work can alleviate some of the suffering in society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following is Wei Mingyi’s account:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Even though a large group of people want to do things well, the suffering has not been alleviated&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The so-called appropriate way to treat a child is to go back to the child himself and understand who he is, how he sees the world, and how he thinks. But in a place with high competition and little regard for children&#39;s human rights, this can easily be overlooked. Many inappropriate interactions and parenting stem from parents who do not view their children as human beings with free will, and such children are unlikely to be healthy. We need to know: Children are not extensions of adults. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Because there are so many things worth reminding, I often say when I teach parents in Taiwan: If you remember Don&#39;t live too much, just remember not to do anything you regret. Don&#39;t use your words to say hurtful things. We look forward to changing others, but when our eyes look at others, it is easy to forget how we face others. If you want your children to respect you, you must first practice respecting your children. I often wonder, is what I am doing now the same as what I teach others? I remind myself in this way: I have to be a consistent person, otherwise I will be very conflicted internally. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Part of my current job is to provide regular training to parents and institutional colleagues. Reservations usually begin in October of the previous year and are then booked throughout the year. I work 25 days a month and go to two different places every day. When I encounter some special suicide cases, I will be added temporarily. The work is intensive, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s self-exploitation. If I can do something, I will try to do it as much as possible. It was only in the past two or three years that I discovered that even though a large group of people seriously wanted to do things well, the suffering was not alleviated. The work of a psychological counselor is like doing back-end first aid. No matter how much time I give, the consultation can&#39;t be completed. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What&#39;s the problem? If the social structure is relatively healthy and cares about life, suffering will not arise so quickly. In the past few years, I wonder if I can go to the frontier and do some primary prevention work, such as writing a book - to organize the things I have seen over the years into words, so that more people can start to have the opportunity before they get worse. Reflecting on the important role that individuals play in the social structure, the entire social structure and cultural situation may have the potential to change. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;These ideas are certainly related to my anthropological training. &quot;The Silent Worker&quot; was a big turning point in my life. Like most people, I used to be quite individualistic and believed that destiny was in the hands of individuals. Facing the general environment, psychology emphasizes adapting through awareness and adjustment. However, from the perspective of anthropology and my field experience in Keelung, I discovered that many things cannot be conquered by man. People are not that great. The role played by the entire social structure and cultural situation is like air that appears around us and affects our lives, but we may not be aware of it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Under the value of &quot;like a man&quot;, men are also victims&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;&quot;The Silent Worker&quot; was originally a very marginal piece of writing, but the response it aroused was beyond my expectation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In 2009, as a graduate student in anthropology, I went to Keelung Pier to do field work. During my eight months in the field, I experienced culture shock. After working as a psychological counselor for more than ten years, I thought I knew a lot about Taiwanese workers and their situation. However, when I went to the field, I found that my knowledge was limited. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the past, whether it was my work or living environment, &quot;like a man&quot; required men to behave tough. , showing their masculinity. In comparison, women seem to be devalued and in a relatively weak position. But in the field I discovered that this gender label has two sides. &quot;Like a Man&quot; frames a daily ideal, allowing men to act in it, think about how to shape themselves to become a &quot;valuable&quot; man, and constantly evaluate whether they are like an (ideal) man. They have to tread a line and if they fall outside of that line they are not recognized and respected. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;On the contrary, women seem not to be expected, but they also grow resilience from the trampling of life, This resilience is more evident in older women. For men who were recognized in their young adulthood, their lives almost plummeted when they failed to meet the mainstream value expectations of society. This is also the reason why the suicide rate of men in Keelung is much higher than that of women. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Keelung&#39;s suicide-seeking data ranks among the top two in Taiwan all year round. Suicide is a word that workers often mention in private, but they are reluctant to talk about it in the field. In addition to feeling shameful, the more common reason is: they have no way of understanding. I usually don’t ask my group of dock friends directly if they have any experience of cheating, but if they have heard of or encountered it. Almost everyone will tell me that they have experienced such a thing at one time or another. Regarding the men around them who have experienced and heard about men who have died suddenly, the most common expression they express is &quot;I&#39;m just fine as usual, I don&#39;t see anything wrong with it.&quot; These responses reminded me of reporter Wang Jialong’s desire to “speak” and “be heard.” &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;One ​​afternoon in the field, Wang Jialong, as usual, said in a local voice that he would take me to try it Authentic snacks that only Keelung people know. But based on previous experiences, I knew he wanted to say something, and he always used food as the excuse. He first talked about how he was careful not to blurt out in front of his current girlfriend that his specialty dish was actually taught by his ex-girlfriend, and then said that he had some things that he never knew who he could tell:&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;It&#39;s from outside. At first, I just call and listen to your voice. Then I want to meet your person, and then I ask you to stay overnight. ;Later, I don’t want your money, I want your people. At that time, my wife and girlfriend were committing suicide, cutting their wrists, and taking sleeping pills. I also took sleeping pills. At that time, I felt that things were all mixed together, such as the privatization of the dock. I didn’t know what the future would be like, and I had a headache every day. As a result, one day the crime team called me and told me that my girlfriend had jumped from the building where we lived together. If a good person becomes like this in our family, others may think that I am good, but I know that it will end in tragedy. (Original words of Wang Jialong)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;So you see, if others don’t know that Wang Jialong has committed a crime, they all I think it’s great that he has many girlfriends. He had no one to talk to about these things, because he couldn&#39;t show his weak side and he had to maintain his dignity. When the entire society emphasizes that men are superior to women and that men should &quot;be like men&quot;, men&#39;s suffering is also rooted in this value system. These are things I didn&#39;t realize before. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/IzZQAXNo5QvBSgbB0M1rfpEv44vXH3YGKZqwUaJw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 677&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/IzZQAXNo5QvBSgbB0M1rfpEv44vXH3YGKZqwUaJw.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252421&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 >;In Tea Shop, they are seen as human beings&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The roles of psychological counselors and researchers are actually very different.

After staying at the dock for more than two months, a reporter said, Miss Wei, you talk to us in the waiting room every day, without basking in the sun or waiting for work in the middle of the night. You don&#39;t know our hard work. Ask us. Will it be close to our reality? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I agreed and would follow him to the dock at midnight the next day and persist until the end of the field. This is &quot;a gate&quot; in the field. The day I showed up at the dock in the early morning, I knew that I was recognized by him. Although I still didn&#39;t understand, I wanted to understand their world, rather than standing in a distant and comfortable position. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After running with this group of dock workers for several months, I found that the information I collected was missing. The female part. At that time, there were not many opportunities for dock workers to go to the &quot;tea shop&quot;, but it was still a topic they often talked about. Although 2009 was well past the busiest period in Keelung as dock workers said, when walking along the port city streets, leisure and entertainment venues such as teahouses, tea shops, and karaoke bars are scattered everywhere. They were connected with the red lights (sex industry area) next to the railway tracks and became the most popular area in Keelung Port City before the late 1990s. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;It is less than one kilometer away from the dock, and dock workers gather here every day. Take the tea shop as an example. Men not only chat and kill time there, but also wait for the boat. Every small shielded space in the house is also a place where they connect with each other and coordinate their work. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Most of the workers in Tea Shop are foreign women with financial difficulties - mostly their spouses or their own Gambling debts, or financial hardship accumulated from previous generations. They moved into this strange port city alone or with their young children in hand, and became &quot;aunties&quot; (female waiters) who could not be called young in the teahouse. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The first time I stepped into Tea Shop was with Li Zhengde (one of the reporters). After entering the door, I saw a table lamp on inside, and the light illuminated a lady with her head lowered at the counter. Li Zhengde&#39;s accompanying friend called her &quot;Auntie&quot; as soon as he entered the door. The latter raised his head from the counter, was stunned for a second or two, and then responded with a smile: &quot;Oh, A Liang, you are here.&quot; Ms. Chen, whom A Liang calls &quot;Auntie,&quot; has long wavy hair, Lightly applied makeup, about 60 years old. After a brief exchange of greetings, Ms. Chen took us up the stairs, helped us order food, and chatted briefly with the three of us. In just ten minutes, she seemed to pay attention to everyone inadvertently, and no one was left out or forgotten in the conversation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Some people confide some unhappiness, and some people get comfort when toasting and clinking glasses. What I experienced in it was not the ambiguous flow of emotions and hormones, but the extremely high concentration of emotional exchanges catalyzed by the men on the dock, and the care Auntie showed for everyone in the house in such a small room. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;This feeling of being cared for and seen is something that dock workers cannot get from their families. When they come home from a busy day, they are expected to be like a husband: bringing home the household items and taking care of the children. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/V3qL8sq2s98Jfb7nY1pP0mpnkOOxcPYK0OOZVUmD.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/V3qL8sq2s98Jfb7nY1pP0mpnkOOxcPYK0OOZVUmD.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252420&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Keelung, a fisherman rides a bicycle past the fishing boats moored at the pier&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Let&#39;s imagine a scenario: My wife is tired after doing a lot of housework at home one day, and receives a call from the teacher saying that the child is at school Naughty and mischievous, her child came home from school with a list of fees to be paid, but she found that there was not enough money. At this time, when her husband came home from get off work, her first thought must be that there was not enough money. Is there any way to give me money? She may also hope that her husband can discipline the children, and she has no time to take care of the tired look on her husband&#39;s face. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The relationship between husband and wife inherently implies some responsibilities and obligations, and the relationship between the dock worker and his aunt Tsai&#39;s social relationship is completely different. They have no responsibilities to bear when going to the tea shop, as long as they enjoy being taken care of. This is also the reason why companion culture is prevalent among dock workers. Once men get married, their roles as husbands and fathers are very thinly regarded. Their roles as human beings can only be restored in spaces like Tea Shop. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;All endings are to be continued&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Talking about Tea Shop Boy Dock workers will also mention red light shops, but they will emphasize that they go to tea shops more often. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When dock workers go to tea shops to chat with aunties, they will think that they are equal and there is no sexual involvement. . Even though the relationship later develops into a romantic and sexual relationship, in their hearts, Auntie is completely different from the women in prostitution. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;This distinction is actually influenced by Confucian culture, that is to say, a person distinguishes himself through his own The body (which is extremely devalued in Confucian culture) or labor in exchange for money are divided into high and low. They are two distinct classes. As consumers, going to tea shops will be regarded as having sufficient economic capital, but if they use money to go to prostitutes, they will be &quot;reduced&quot; to relatively powerless people - they need to pay directly to obtain sexual relations. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;This distinction is not only for women, but also for themselves. For example, as a female graduate student, the way they talk to me is different from the way I talk to my aunties. I was bookish to them, and my gender as a woman was downplayed. When they chat with me, they match my word choices, switch from dialect to Mandarin, and never smoke. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the late 1990s, with the rapid shift of international routes, international cargo ships left Keelung Port one after another. Amid price-cutting competition from private companies, port stevedores and container truck drivers have become direct bearers of the era of &quot;small profits&quot; claimed by cross-border companies. Most of the workers were forced to leave the docks, and the wages of those who remained on the docks were cut by more than half. This not only means a change in their economic conditions, but also reshapes their original cluster-style work space. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/6mG5MbmwjFb10YpfsU1dKX8xixRgScScZdRAHAxc.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/6mG5MbmwjFb10YpfsU1dKX8xixRgScScZdRAHAxc.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252418&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Keelung Port&#39;s container yard&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;With the wave of layoffs, dock workers were driven back to their families. But over a long period of time, the accompanying culture has long pulled the dock workers away from their families. When they returned in the lower class era, they found that there was only an atmosphere of family dinners with nothing to say, the children&#39;s accusations of their father&#39;s early absence, and the fact that their father could no longer provide enough Quarrel and conflict over money. Their former event space was also developed into an ocean plaza by the local government to attract more tourists. They were expelled from the visible public space because their image did not conform to the international tourist image. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The sad thing is that they often blame themselves for their decline. When a person&#39;s suffering stems from social structures but is seen as a personal problem, he may become immobilized and have a lot of self-blame. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After &quot;Silent Worker&quot; was published in Taiwan in 2016, many readers said it looked very good and felt that the dock The workers’ stories are harrowing. After hearing these comments, I also reflected. What readers are reading is the story. How to connect us with what happened to the dock workers? Therefore, when I wrote &quot;Reflections of Suffering&quot;, I changed my style and became very analytical. I didn&#39;t want to be a person who sells stories. After &quot;Reflections of Suffering&quot; was published this year, readers said it was painful to read. I said that was right, because pain is the truth of life. Many readers have also asked me that our suffering seems to be related to the overall environment. What should we do? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Don’t forget that no matter how large the social structure is, it is still composed of many individuals. If I didn&#39;t believe in personal power, I wouldn&#39;t quit working to write a book. Even if what we do now is in line with social and cultural expectations, as long as our awareness is clear, given time, you can go in the opposite direction. As long as people&#39;s free will is still there, they will not be co-opted or become something they don&#39;t like. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;If you have the opportunity to come to Keelung recently, you will find that Ocean Plaza, which is often visited by tourists, has Street performers with local characteristics sing songs that dockworkers would listen to. In the evening, everyone sat in the square watching the sea and listening to songs. Ocean Plaza was originally planned as a very middle-class place, but local people changed its purpose. So, as I wrote in &quot;Reflection of Suffering&quot;, all endings are unfinished. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Part of the content is quoted from &quot;Silent Workers&quot; and &quot;Reflections of Suffering&quot;.

He&#39;s all soft and weak, with no spirit at all. &quot;He can&#39;t show his bloody side, it&#39;s just because he has developed a habit.&quot; &quot;This man should do it, you have to do it.&quot; Go fight, you are too timid to act like a man, but you are not fighting like a man.&quot; This caused a lot of resonance and discussion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Have athletes lost their fighting spirit and vigor as their incomes have increased and their training conditions have improved? Obviously, the two are not necessarily related. There are also top athletes who have higher incomes, better training conditions, and still have high morale. This situation is even more common. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One possible explanation is incentives. If the athlete&#39;s level is not outstanding and there is a significant gap compared with the international level, but due to the popularity of domestic fans and commercial endorsements, he can get high income, then for the athlete, the marginal benefit of continuing to work hard will be very small. Well, as long as we can compete on the field, why bother fighting to the death? On the contrary, if an athlete can only get a high salary if he performs well on the field, then he will have a strong incentive to work hard and maximize his potential. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in addition to motivation, as an athlete, internal drive is also important, if not more important. To do something well, it is not enough to rely on incentives such as fame and fortune. You must feel that doing it well has intrinsic meaning and you have a strong motivation to do it. What supports all of this is your own personality. Inner endowment: You must have strong vitality, blood, courage, fighting spirit, a sense of honor, a field from the inside out, and a strong and radiant soul. In a word, you must have a strong spirit. Kernel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, to accomplish something, the methodology or technical approach comes second, and the motivation or internal driving force to accomplish it comes first. If you have internal drive, you won&#39;t feel it&#39;s hard to work hard, and you will devote yourself to it and get closer to your goal step by step. On the other hand, if you need a strong push from the outside world or outsiders to do this, your internal motivation is insufficient. You will neither set high goals for yourself nor strive for excellence, and will just muddle along. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This strong vitality, drive, or courage is often called &quot;masculinity.&quot; Society as a whole expects men to possess these qualities, so-called &quot;like a man.&quot; But this does not mean that courage or &quot;masculinity&quot; are only possessed by men. Margaret Thatcher and Dong Mingzhu are examples of such women. In fact, regardless of whether you are a man or a woman, no matter what era or country you are in, if a person wants to achieve success, the most important personal trait is to have courage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When watching sports, people hope to feel the beauty of speed and strength, feel the courage and bloodiness from the athletes&#39; sweaty struggles on the field, and witness the challenges and breakthroughs to human beings&#39; own limits. This is what people who spend money and time to watch events hope to get. Athletes who fail to provide this are doing their consumers/supporters a debt. Liu Yudong&#39;s criticism of the men&#39;s basketball team should be viewed in this sense. After all, Liu Yudong knew what he wanted to do and has always understood what the public expects from athletes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To a certain extent, the playing field is a reflection of society. There is a longstanding public discussion about courage or &quot;masculinity.&quot; The discussion focused on the phenomenon that today&#39;s children seem to be becoming more and more fragile, and boys are increasingly lacking &quot;masculinity&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Being mentally fragile is not a good thing. How can a child grow into a qualified adult if he cannot bear a little setback? This has resulted in many children becoming &quot;neotenish&quot; when they grow up, without the mental state that adults should have. A lack of “masculinity” in boys is also not a good thing. We cannot think that it is no big deal for men to be more feminine and at the same time hope that men will stand up to injustice when they see it. We cannot think that children must be &quot;obedient&quot; and &quot;good&quot; at the same time, and at the same time hope that they will have a strong spiritual core when they grow up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone has seen the &quot;disappeared ten minutes between classes&quot;. This is indeed caused by many factors, and many parties are responsible. It is not difficult to find that the main consideration of this move is to eliminate various risks that children face in school. This approach and its educational outlook are very problematic. Children cannot go downstairs or go to the playground during class, and are stuck in the classroom most of the time. This is contrary to the child&#39;s nature of loving freedom and playing. How can it be possible to let children Are children mentally robust, robust and antifragile? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also, it is common to count class points, which leads to children supervising and grading children. If a child commits a minor offense, the class points will be deducted, and group sitting and companionship will be carried out, creating confusion between teachers and students. Confrontation with children. Children with a little bit of personality will be subject to various disciplines, pressure and &quot;polishing&quot;.

A large amount of research shows that similarity attracts a powerful rule in interpersonal communication. R. Matthew Montoya, a psychologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, has analyzed more than 300 related experiments and surveys, and the results show that the relationship between interpersonal attraction and similarity is very significant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And this association is not only reflected in the actual similarity, but also in the perceived similarity. That is to say, in social interaction, not only the objective degree of similarity will generate attraction between people, but also the subjective feeling of similarity will enhance interpersonal attraction. Therefore, even if two people have only a short relationship or even no interaction at all, as long as they feel that they are similar to each other, they may be attracted to each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, why does similarity attract? For a long time, psychologists did not agree on the mechanism behind this. Recently, researchers from institutions such as Boston University and Stanford University tried to explore the mechanism behind the similarity attraction effect through a series of experiments. Their findings suggest that the psychological laws of self-essentialist reasoning may lead to people being attracted to similar people. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Imagination of essential fit&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Essentialist reasoning is actually very common in daily life. In addition to using &quot;nature is hard to change&quot; to predict a person&#39;s In addition to human development trends, people are also accustomed to making moral judgments by tracing the good and bad of their &quot;essence&quot; to comprehensively evaluate people&#39;s behaviors and motivations. In the process of essentializing everything around them, people will try to find the inherent unchangeable characteristics of a thing to define it, and at the same time, get rid of the illusion attached to it to recognize the essence of a thing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, although wolves and dogs look very similar, a wolf is a wolf and a dog is a dog. There are essential differences. The behavior of a group of people may be very different and elusive, but through their occupation, community, region and other social attributes, the essentialist reasoning method will allow people to naturally deduce some essential attributes they share. In the process of essentializing the self, people will also unconsciously ask what kind of nature the true self has deep inside. When carrying out various social activities and facing complicated interpersonal relationships, this nature of the self will be revealed. Doctrine reasoning has become an important reference for people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through four sets of experiments involving more than 2,000 people, researchers believe that the reason why people are attracted to similar people can be roughly divided into two processes. First, people gain insight into some of their own essential characteristics based on the belief in self-essentialism, and then refer to these to define people with common attributes as people who are very similar to themselves. Secondly, use essentialist reasoning to project their other essential characteristics onto similar people, and form an overall impression of similar people through speculation, thereby strengthening their own understanding of the world. Relevant research was published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in April 2023, providing a new explanation for revealing the laws of interpersonal communication. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first set of experiments, nearly a thousand participants were randomly assigned to some controversial social issue situations to learn their views on the death penalty, euthanasia, gun ownership and other issues. Subsequently, the researchers also introduced participants to a virtual character named Jamie through reading materials. To some, Jamie has similar views on social issues, while to others, Jamie has very different views. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The researchers then measured people&#39;s essentialist beliefs about themselves, as well as indicators of Jamie&#39;s attraction to them. As expected, the more participants endorsed self-essentialism, the belief that there are constant qualities within themselves, the more likely they were to be attracted to Jamie, who shared similar views. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In subsequent experiments, the researchers continued to verify some of the key nodes and found that even small similarities are enough to generate attraction. However, if the essentialist concept and broader similarities are severed, The correlation between people makes people believe that the similarity of opinions has nothing to do with the essential fit, and the effect of similarity attraction is weakened. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Complex Attraction&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the reasoning of attraction through similarity, the process of inferring commonalities against the essential characteristics of individuals is extremely critical. . People usually start from the similarities they find between the two parties and imagine in their minds that they have more things in common with each other, thereby feeling stronger attraction to the other party. But when the researchers told participants that this cognitive style was inaccurate and could not form reliable perceptions of others, the effect of similar attraction also weakened. These controlled experiments further suggest that some of the thought processes associated with self-essentialist reasoning may be causally related to the similarity attraction effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The phenomenon of attraction through similarity has been discovered for a long time, but previously, psychologists mainly explained this phenomenon from the aspects of motivation and cognition. For example, one view is that there are people with similar ideas to oneself, which actually validates one&#39;s own ideas and satisfies people&#39;s pursuit of a consistent worldview, which will obviously generate positive emotions and attraction. There is also the idea that shared characteristics and perspectives mean greater support, which is positive information for a social goal. The findings of the latest research mean that the unconscious cognitive mode of self-essentialist reasoning may be a major mechanism behind similar attraction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Human social relationships are complex. Some people attract much attention and are attractive to many people, while most people have limited attraction. Psychologist Matthew Montoya once proposed a two-dimensional model for understanding interpersonal attraction, which focuses on assessing a person&#39;s abilities and willingness. Interpersonal attraction to another person is strong if one person has both the ability to promote the needs and goals of another and the underlying willingness to do so. And these attractions are usually expressed through some behaviors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, some researchers summarized some attraction-related behaviors through survey analysis, such as eye contact, smiling, imitation, etc. These behaviors caused by interpersonal attraction also contribute to trust. of construction. Compared with indirect behaviors such as eye contact, smiling, and imitation, more direct behaviors such as physical contact and conversation have a stronger relationship with perceived attraction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, once a threat is anticipated and the possibility of rejection is high, people&#39;s behavior will be affected even if they feel emotionally attracted. The research, published in the Psychological Bulletin, provides some insights into concrete understanding of attraction. Compared with these external manifestations, the latest research focuses on the source of attraction, providing a mechanistic explanation for the phenomenon of similar attraction. It should be noted that the latest research also has some obvious limitations that may affect the understanding of related phenomena. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, the attraction measured in the study belongs to the first impression. Although the first impression is also very important when meeting by chance, going on a blind date, or communicating with strangers on social software, it is not important in daily life. In subsequent interactions, there are actually a large number of different social situations, and attraction may not only depend on the first impression. Furthermore, the social and cultural background of the psychological experiment participants in the study lacks sufficient representation, and the differences in the idea of ​​self-essentialism in different cultural environments may affect relevant conclusions. These need to be confirmed by more research in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;It is not easy to understand others&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In modern society, contact with strangers is a normal part of life. In some interactions, a few words of conversation can give you the feeling of feeling like old friends and cherishing each other at first sight. According to the latest research, this warm experience of finding similar people is likely based on self-essentialist beliefs and related reasoning processes. For society as a whole, this discovery may help people understand some of the bad phenomena related to human nature in modern society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, people can infer or even assert the nature of others based on only a small amount of observations, and divide people around them into different camps based on similarities and differences in only some of their views, creating group antagonisms. In these cases, whether it is the attraction caused by similarity or the distance caused by dissimilarity, it affects people&#39;s ability to obtain the real situation and is not conducive to making accurate judgments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the opinion of researchers, understanding others is an extremely difficult thing compared to understanding oneself, and new research findings mean that people are always accustomed to using their own feelings to understand others through speculation and other methods. People, and this way of reasoning obviously has certain problems. Although the similarity attraction effect allows people to see themselves in other similar people, get to know themselves better, and build their own social circle, this way of thinking of labeling people based on initial impressions can also easily exclude some people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In public life, this may lead to people fighting against dissimilar people because of less important differences such as interests and hobbies, and in business decisions, an overly self-centered approach to decision-making can also lead to The efficiency becomes lower. Using self as a reference to judge who is more like you and who is not like you. This model of attraction generation may seem simple, but it may not be an effective way. &amp;nbsp;Nevertheless, the attraction generated by similarity as a guide for relationships appears to be an important rule in the development of romantic relationships. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, Youyou Wu, a researcher at the Department of Psychology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom, and others pointed out in a study in Psychological Science that relationships between partners and friends Not only will they be more similar in terms of region, age, education level, concepts and IQ, but they will also be more similar in personality. However, Wu Youyou also explained to Southern Weekend reporters that it is not yet certain whether people are together because they are similar, or whether they become similar because they are together. There is also insufficient evidence whether attracting people together by similarity is more conducive to the development of relationships. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;A rational view of the attraction effect&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;However, even so, some other phenomena found in romantic relationship research still support the similar attraction effect to a certain extent. Influence. For example, it is common for friends to develop into lovers. A survey by psychologists at the University of Victoria showed that nearly two-thirds of people said they had or currently had the experience of developing a relationship with a friend. In the friend stage, they not only spend a lot of time together to understand and communicate with each other, but also have many similarities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, psychological research based on German society also found that people tend to find another person with similar personality traits to their ex even after breaking up. Relevant research was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) in 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yoobin Park, a scientist at the Department of Psychology at the University of Toronto who participated in this study, told Southern Weekend reporters that repeatedly looking for similar people as romantic partners has both advantages and disadvantages. The place. The good thing is that people already have relatively familiar strategies for getting along with similar people, and can make better use of their past social experiences to deal with future challenges. But the bad thing is that once you encounter similar obstacles that you can&#39;t get over, the ending of the relationship may be similar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These phenomena that may be related to the similar attraction effect remind people that they should treat the attraction caused by similar partial characteristics rationally. From age, height to income and job, many people are accustomed to using quantitative comparison as a reference for finding a partner or even a marriage partner, in order to find someone with very similar material conditions. However, large-scale studies on partnerships have shown that indicators such as a partner’s personal characteristics are generally less effective in predicting the quality of a partnership. Whether it is a high degree of education or a high income, it does not mean that you will definitely have a high-quality partner in the future. relation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most predictive indicator is the relationship itself, which is the dynamic feelings partners have toward each other during their long-term relationship, such as trust, mutual appreciation, perceived commitment of the other party, etc. Combined with the findings of the latest research, these dynamic relationship situations are not achieved by similar attraction like love at first sight, but rely on the continuous maintenance of the relationship during the long-term relationship between the two parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, it is worth noting that the similarity attraction effect is not only reflected in romantic relationships, acquaintance relationships or even real relationships. As a more common psychological phenomenon, between strangers who pass by each other, Even between people who interact only virtually, attraction can arise because of similarity. The relationships between these strangers, and the corresponding risks, also deserve attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 07 Oct 2023 10:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[议长麦卡锡被本党议员罢免，共和党发生了什么？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258176]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-07 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/06/8JIm3FXtzEvK6ZLvOiGThdO8pWzxcRrYA4R56xdj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/8JIm3FXtzEvK6ZLvOiGThdO8pW zxcRrYA4R56xdj. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253122&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 3, 2023, the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Florida Republican Congressman Martin Gates talks with reporters after the House Republican meeting &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;October 3, 2023, United States A shocking scene unfolded in the House of Representatives.

This is also the first time in the history of American politics that a speaker has been removed from office. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the surface, the reason for McCarthy&#39;s removal was that he cooperated with the Democratic Party to pass a temporary federal funding bill before the October 1st deadline, which prevented the Biden government from shutting down and angered those in the party. Far right. The current hijacking of the entire party by far-right groups within the Republican Party has made it difficult to bridge the gap between the traditional right-wing represented by McCarthy and the far-right represented by Matt Gaetz.

This made the far-right &quot;Freedom Caucus&quot; (Freedom Caucus) with only a dozen people a &quot; The key few forces are those who fail to succeed but fail to succeed. In January 2023, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California, was elected speaker after a record 15 rounds of voting. The reason was the constant vetoes from members of the &quot;Freedom Caucus&quot;, of which Matt Gaetz was the leader. member. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, McCarthy gave them major concessions, including allowing anyone in the party to bring a motion to remove the speaker—a new rule that McCarthy later backed down to, which he himself had nodded to months earlier. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The cause of the matter is the budget. The U.S. government&#39;s new fiscal year begins on October 1 of each year. Presumably to allow time for protracted bargaining in Congress, the Biden administration had already proposed a budget for the next year as early as March 2023, but the two parties have been unable to reach a consensus in the next six months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The far-right Republican Party hopes to significantly reduce government spending to alleviate the serious fiscal deficit and ease the debt crisis. At the same time, it will spend more money on domestic issues such as the border refugee crisis and reduce aid to Ukraine; the Democratic Party believes that Assisting vulnerable groups is the government&#39;s obligation. Supporting specific industries through tax cuts and subsidies is to maintain the competitiveness of the United States. Aiding Ukraine is an international obligation of the United States as a global leader, so it opposes spending cuts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The matter was delayed until the end of September. If there is no budget, according to the law, after October 1, except for a few essential public services, all other government workers must take unpaid leave. This is commonly known as a &quot;government shutdown.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 1976, there have been 21 government shutdowns in the U.S. government, most of which occurred during Clinton’s term as president. The then Speaker of the House of Representatives, Gingrich, caused many artificial shutdowns because of his disagreement with Clinton. The &quot;Government Shutdown&quot; incident; the longest government shutdown occurred from 2018 to 2019, when then-President Trump and congressional Democrats were in a stalemate over the construction of a border wall, resulting in the failure of the government budget to pass. That government shutdown lasted 35 days, running through the Christmas and New Year holidays. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Seeing that the government shutdown was about to happen again, House Speaker McCarthy pushed the House to propose an interim budget a few hours before the deadline. It was finally passed by a vote of 335 to 91, and then the bill was passed in the Senate It also passed by a vote of 88 to 9 to extend federal funding until November 17. The crisis of government shutdown is temporarily lifted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although McCarthy deliberately excluded the content of aid to Ukraine in the interim budget to appease the extreme right wing of the party, the latter did not appreciate it. They found it difficult to accept McCarthy&#39;s betrayal of cooperating with the Democratic Party, so they left it to the Democratic Party. Gates took the lead in proposing a motion to remove McCarthy from office. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although McCarthy was dismissed by the Republican Party because he cooperated with the Democratic Party to pass the interim budget, politics is realistic. The Democratic Party does not intend to help McCarthy retain the speakership, and they also have a high degree of distrust in McCarthy, including McCarthy. Not long ago, he also led the launch of the impeachment investigation against President Biden, and tried his best to please former President Trump after the Capitol riots on January 6, 2021, etc. The 2024 election is only a year and a month away, and Democrats are probably happy to see their competitors in chaos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is said that the centrists of the Democratic Party had communicated with McCarthy in private before, but McCarthy did not show goodwill and put forward clear exchange conditions, so the Democratic Party had no incentive to come to the rescue. Jeffries, the Democratic leader of the House of Representatives, said in a letter to all his fellow Democratic members: &quot;It is the responsibility of Republican members to end the Republican civil war in the House of Representatives.&quot; As a result, all Democrats voted in support of the recall bill. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, of the 216 votes supporting the recall, Gates and his Republican comrades only contributed 8 votes, while the Democrats contributed 208 votes; the Republicans voted 210 against; among the 7 who did not vote, 4 Democrats and 3 Republicans. Gates&#39; political revenge, combined with the Democratic Party&#39;s political calculations, ended McCarthy&#39;s career as speaker just 72 hours after the interim budget was passed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;McCarthy finally accepted the vote results with a smile and said he did not regret cooperating with the Democratic Party. It should be said that he demonstrated the sense of responsibility and responsibility of a veteran politician. This kind of cross-party cooperation based on national interests was originally very common and considered a fine tradition of American politics. However, in recent years, due to the deepening of partisan differences, it has become It&#39;s becoming increasingly rare. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/XFX5oFvfLliIzWgZhhS2xlPhyLL09UnsUHmUNjrL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/XFX5oFvfLliIzWgZhhS2xlPhyLL09UnsUHmUNjrL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253124&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 3, 2023, live footage of the House of Representatives voting to remove Republican House Speaker McCarthy in Washington, D.C.&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo )&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Who is Matt Gates? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Matt Gaetz, who took the lead in calling for McCarthy’s removal, was born in May 1982. He has been a federal representative representing Florida’s first district since 2016 and has been re-elected three times. His father, Don Gates, was also a politician and served as president of the Florida Senate. Matt Gates had previously been implicated in a scandal of paying for sex with underage girls, but the Justice Department finally decided not to prosecute in February 2023 after a two-year investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Matt Gaetz represents a congressional district with conservative values. Since running for the House of Representatives for the first time in 2016, he has led by more than 30% in a total of 4 elections. , there is no need to worry that his idiosyncratic behavior will have a negative impact on his political career. Voters obviously like his ideas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of philosophy, Gates actually has a lot in common with the left wing of the Democratic Party, such as opposing foreign military intervention, supporting the decriminalization of certain recreational drugs such as marijuana, and calling for stronger supervision of large technology companies. ,etc. But Gates is often classified as far-right, more because of his combative style than ideology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ostensible reason why Gates is so obsessed with removing McCarthy is that McCarthy worked with Democrats to pass an interim budget, allowing the government to avoid a shutdown, which is beneficial to the Biden administration. However, the underlying reason is still personal political interests: Gates is a fan of Trump, and his political methods are similar to Trump&#39;s. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like Trump, Gates is good at turning politics into entertainment and using social media and Fox News to build momentum for himself and attract voters to maintain his personal attention. For example, in October 2019, during the impeachment investigation of Trump by House Democrats, he led more than a dozen Republican congressmen into the sensitive information isolation room of Congress and live broadcast the confidential impeachment hearing content to social media; the new coronavirus epidemic During this period, he once wore a gas mask to work; then in early 2023, he repeatedly vetoed McCarthy as speaker and removed McCarthy this time. US media speculated that the congressman is considering running for Florida governor in 2026: due to term limits, current Governor Ron DeSantis will not be able to seek re-election by then. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rise of Matt Gates, like the rise of Trump, has a profound social background: the development of globalization has caused a large number of blue-collar jobs in the United States to be transferred overseas, and the knowledge economy has made educational attainment and success Directly linked, and less than 30% of American adults have college diplomas. As a result, the biggest losers in this process are the white middle class who have graduated from high school but do not have college diplomas. Most of these people have gathered under the Republican Party. They are opposed to globalization. dissatisfaction, and the conservative attitude of never giving in on moral issues such as anti-abortion, anti-same-sex marriage, and gun rights, are all reflected in the Republican Party&#39;s platform and style of conduct. Whether it is Trump’s vulgarity or the sex trafficking scandals in which he and Matt Gaetz have been accused, their supporters regard it as a manifestation of “masculinity” and are harmless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, Gates alone cannot remove McCarthy. Seven other Republican congressmen agreed to remove him, most of them from the far-right &quot;Liberty Caucus&quot; in the party. This caucus originated from the &quot;Tea Party&quot; wave in 2010. Its members were very dissatisfied with the inability of the mainstream Republican Party to check the strict fiscal discipline adopted by the Obama administration. They believed that it was necessary to establish a new organization to exert the collective influence of right-wing members and appeal to the Republican leadership. Put pressure on them to restore the tradition of &quot;financial prudence&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Freedom Caucus&quot; is an alternative within the Republican Party, which is dedicated to having trouble with the top leaders of the party. In 2015, the &quot;Freedom Caucus&quot; believed that then-House Speaker John Boehner was not tough enough on Obama and forced the former to resign; in 2017, the &quot;Freedom Caucus&quot; tried to launch a challenge to then-Speaker Paul Ryan through its internal members, and the latter Forced to resign early to avoid humiliation. From this point of view, McCarthy&#39;s recall motion by members of the &quot;Freedom Caucus&quot; is just another flashback of history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/jTeN4HMXqVTUgmkklGWfCpYGB0UlzieGHvaBdrTB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/jTeN4HMXqVTUgmkklGWfCpYGB0UlzieGHvaBdrTB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253125&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 3, 2023, in Washington, the United States, McCarthy spoke to media reporters.

At the top of McCarthy&#39;s recommendation list is North Carolina Rep. Patrick McHenry, a close McCarthy ally who has begun serving as acting speaker, responsible for convening next week to re-elect the speaker. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;McHenry was furious at McCarthy&#39;s ouster. In retaliation, he emailed former Speaker Pelosi to vacate her office in the Capitol, and also expelled former House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Democrat. According to tradition, these two people have previously retained their offices in Congress. It is rumored that the vacated office of Pelosi will be allocated to McCarthy. Staff had already started cleaning the office on the evening of the 3rd.

Some pro-Republican parties The media also criticized Gates as a liar and a reputation seeker. The other seven Republican congressmen who voted after Matt Gaetz were either wildly criticized on TV shows or threatened to cut off financial support from the party. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/9p8cYVY2tWBoprZUp6JWOxCvqeDGTVR91WztDJWZ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;705&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/9p8cYVY2tWBoprZUp6JWOxCvqeDGTVR91WztDJWZ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253126&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On June 1, 2023, pedestrians walked past the &quot;Treasury Debt Clock&quot; in New York, USA.

However, how long can such voices last, and to what extent can they be translated into actual support for teachers’ work? The answer is probably not optimistic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report listed various unreasonable reports: a teacher was reported for responding to parents’ messages three hours late; a teacher wore a skirt and was complained by a student’s mother as “not like a serious person”; A teacher was reported by his parents as being inexperienced and unable to lead the class on the second day after he joined the job... It makes people feel that some parents use their strong energy to find faults and act wantonly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report quoted some teachers as saying that the problem stems from &quot;preparation and hostility permeating the gap between schools and families, and the vicious news of many teachers beating children has exacerbated distrust. Some people will take advantage of this emotion.&quot; , to satisfy their own demands.” This explanation is that: some teachers have lost their ethics → public opinion added fuel to the flames → an atmosphere of &quot;precaution and hostility&quot; → some parents took the opportunity to cause trouble and profit. This chain is reasonable but incomplete, and there is still room to further dig into the root of the problem. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the home-school relationship has gone through a good period. This stage was roughly before the rise of the mobile Internet and smartphones. The main setting for teachers and parents to meet was the parent-teacher conference, which was a rare meeting on weekdays and they were contacted by phone for important matters. This brings a benefit: &quot;Distance creates beauty.&quot; Teachers and parents do their own thing without interfering with each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Technological progress is a double-edged sword. WeChat home-school groups and DingTalk groups have been established one after another, allowing teachers and parents to communicate in real time. On the surface, it improves the communication efficiency between the two parties, but it also invisibly removes the traditional barriers and boundaries between home and school. From then on, school teachers asked parents to check in here and pick up the relay in that group. Most parents did not dare not cooperate even if they were busy at work, for fear that their children would be treated differently in school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this transformation process, the teacher is only an executor and cannot help himself. But as more and more educational and non-educational tasks are carried out, and are pressed down to parents through the school-teacher chain, schools have become grassroots governance organizations, woven into every family with children. As the saying goes, &quot;little hands hold big hands&quot;, children become the leverage to control parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the surface obedience and harmony, tensions between the school, teachers and parents are constantly accumulating. This tension stems from parents’ dissatisfaction with being subject to various controls and disciplines by the school. If they cannot find an exit here, they will find an exit there. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the distrust between home and school is also deepening. In addition to the &quot;vicious news about many teachers beating children&quot; mentioned in the report, it also includes the fact that the canteen in the school is sold at a sky-high price and students are not allowed to do it themselves. Bringing in bedding, all the controversies surrounding prepared meals, etc. all contribute to and exacerbate parent distrust of schools. These may not all be the school&#39;s responsibility. Teachers often take the blame, but parents will (only) point the finger directly at the school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, there is no need to excuse some parents. It is true that some parents are troubled and unreasonable. At this time, the response and actions of the school and its authorities are very critical: if you adhere to the principles and do not get along with each other, although you may face a lot of pressure at a time, you can avoid forming bad incentives for other parents and avoid long-term consequences. , also established justice. Unfortunately, they often adopt a calm attitude. Any complaints from parents are taken seriously. &quot;I would rather submit to teachers than to parents&quot; is based on the same mentality. In this way, can there not be too many unreasonable complaints from parents? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beiqing Daily reported: A 12345 operator in Chengdu believed that some reports were &quot;outrageous&quot; in her opinion. A parent called to complain because he was dissatisfied with the teacher&#39;s arrangement of his children&#39;s seats in the back row of the classroom. The parent admitted that although the teacher had clearly stated that seats were arranged according to height, he still felt it was unreasonable because those sitting in the back were He is a poor student. Although his child is tall, he studies well and should not be arranged like this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report said: In a certain boarding school, more than a hundred students called 12345 at the same time to report that the school ended too late. In response to such reports, the school tried giving Friday afternoons off, but parent dissatisfaction immediately came back. They received reports from parents one after another from 12345 and the mayor’s mailbox: The school did not have classes in the afternoon. What kind of handling method caused the school to suffer back-and-forth attacks from parents and students? I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s not just a problem between parents and students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, it is necessary to solve the problem of massive unreasonable complaints from parents and students against the school, to eliminate the &quot;preparation and hostility&quot; and distrust that pervades the home-school relationship, and to prevent teachers and schools from &quot;giving up&quot; because of this. &quot;The key to &quot;putting down the problem&quot; and &quot;laying it down&quot; is to re-establish the boundaries of rights between home and school, so that family education and school education can return to their respective places, and no longer make parents tired by assigning various non-educational tasks to parents through schools and teachers. If you can&#39;t cope with it, don&#39;t treat your children as fat sheep and try to make money from them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On this basis, when 12345 faces complaints with the education authorities, it should adhere to principles, reason, and right from wrong. It should not force teachers to prove their innocence, not give in to bad parents, and establish decent values. Stimulate the good in human nature and restrain the evil in human nature. Only in this way can schools carry out educational activities normally and pass on good values ​​to children. Our children can continue to improve in knowledge, morality and values, and inspire and demonstrate their conscience and talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 07 Oct 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[札达土林：远古“宫堡”，藏西秘境丨眼睛在旅游⑧]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257607]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-06 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[锦江：此心安处是吾乡丨月是故乡明⑧]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257349]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-06 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;I have been living in Chengdu for twenty-five years. I keep moving along the Jinjiang River, as if in the fog. I stop and go like a boat, not knowing where my heart is at home. Inadvertently, it moved from the original downstream to the current upstream. It was not until it was close to Huanhua Creek and adjacent to Du Fu&#39;s Thatched Cottage that the fog seemed to gradually dissipate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yes, in the past twenty-five years, Jinjiang has been the pillow that accompanies me to sleep every night. I didn’t realize it because it was so familiar. Just in June 2022, when I was able to calm down and look at Jinjiang again, I suddenly discovered that every time I moved before, it was a coincidence that the direction of my door overlapped with my sleeping posture many times, either facing Jinjiang or with my back to Jinjiang. , actually completely consistent. It turns out that all my uneasiness over the years was nothing more than impulsiveness, tossing and stubbornness when I was tossing and turning. The so-called conflict between survival and the so-called poetry and the distance was resolved tonight at the &quot;Hejiang Pavilion&quot; at the intersection of Fuhe and Nanhe, collectively known as Jinjiang River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jinjiang, which used to be exclusive to Nanhe River, now also includes Fuhe River. Jinjiang River, whether it is the Nanhe section or the Fuhe section, except for spring tides and summer floods, rarely sees real rapids, and most of the time it always passes through the urban area of ​​Chengdu casually. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This time I followed the famous literary group organized by the Jinjiang District Federation of Literary and Art Circles to revisit Jinjiang, from the December City Museum to the Shuijingfang Museum, and then from Hejiang Pavilion to Dongmen Market and Li Jieren’s former residence on the banks of the Shah River. Walking along both sides of the Jinjiang River, I discovered that it actually has many faces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/18/VV4GRYkoaUV6cISe3uPg3aUadwhsXxlRWk1AU9mw.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;639&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/18/VV4GRYkoaUV6cISe3uPg3aUadwhsXxlRWk1AU9mw.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;205682&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wangjiang Tower on the South Bank of Jinjiang River&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Moving like a dragon&lt; /h4>; &lt;p>;Rapid, turbulent, moving like a dragon, it should be the first face of Jinjiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tracing back to my fate with Jinjiang, I first read Du Fu’s poem in “Spring Night Rain” when I was in elementary school: “The clouds are all dark on the wild paths, but the fire on the river boats is only bright. At dawn, I can see the red and wet The place is full of flowers.&quot; But I didn&#39;t know at that time which river the &quot;river boat&quot; in the poem was. I grew up on the banks of the Jialing River. Every time I saw a wooden boat passing by the fast-moving Jialing River, I wanted to get on the boat immediately and rush to this &quot;river boat&quot; river written by Du Fu. I wanted to see if it could Also has a turbulent character. In 1997, I came to Chengdu to go to college. I saw the evergreen Du Fu Thatched Cottage by the Huanhua River and read more of Du Fu&#39;s Chengdu poems. Only then did I realize that this river that has been rippling in Chengdu for thousands of years was originally called Jinjiang. Today&#39;s scholars and old Chengdu people often regard Huanhua Creek as the starting point of Jinjiang River, but in Du Fu&#39;s eyes, the source of Jinjiang River is at the foot of Yulei Mountain in Dujiangyan. Therefore, he said in another poem &quot;Climbing the Tower&quot;, &quot;Jinjiang River The spring scenery comes to heaven and earth, and the jade barrier and floating clouds change the past and present.&quot; The water cultural gene of Jinjiang comes from the Minjiang River, which moves like a dragon at the foot of Yulei Mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have traveled to Yulei Mountain many times and experienced firsthand the source of the Jinjiang River. The surging Minjiang River is in Dujiangyan. The majestic Puyang River flows out of the Baopingkou not far from the foot of Yulei Mountain. , the river is most unrestrained when it flows through the Dujiangyan South Bridge. From a distance, you can hear the sound of the raging waves hitting each other and violently beating the earth and rocks on both sides. After passing the South Bridge, near the &quot;Tianfuyuan&quot;, the Puyang River split into two, with a Zouma River sloping out from the side. Soon it split into two again, and a cypress river was cut out like a branch, and the Minjiang River flowed straight down. So far, the Zouma River and Baitiao River that branched out have run through the Chengdu Plain, nurturing the people of Shu and achieving the reputation of a land of abundance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Diverting the surging Minjiang River water to irrigate the Chengdu Plain, this huge credit certainly belongs to Li Bing, the prefect of Shu County during the reign of King Qin Zhao, who presided over the construction of the Dujiangyan Irrigation Project. When he governed Shu, he first controlled the floods, which solved the survival concerns of the people in Shu during the Qin Dynasty. He also paved the way for Chengdu to become one of the most prosperous industrial and commercial cities in the country during the Tang Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/18/pQ2pzo7dXnWLSo3PaMNGE813avxx5fwOdX5CLScE.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/18/pQ2pzo7dXnWLSo3PaMNGE813avxx5fwOdX5CLScE.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;205680&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Source of Jinjiang River: Minjiang River at the foot of Yulei Mountain in Dujiangyan&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Peng Zhiqiang/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Jing Like a Virgin&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Calm, elegant, and as quiet as a lady, this is Jin Jiang’s second face. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the many sub-rivers of the Minjiang River, the Zouma River, especially the Huanhua Creek where the lower reaches of the Zouma River and the upper reaches of the Jinjiang River are located, are undoubtedly the clearest. Anyone who stops here will be impressed, not least because Huanhua Creek and its 600-acre Huanhua Creek Park have now become the largest green lung in Chengdu. The internal reason is closely related to the poem &quot;washing&quot; in the past dynasties. Especially after Du Fu settled here, Jinjiang gradually evolved into a river of poetry, with clear words and beautiful sentences constantly polishing its body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The mighty Minjiang River has passed through the outer city in the west of Chengdu since ancient times and flowed near Du Fu Thatched Cottage, but its eager temper has created a gentle Huanhua Creek. No wonder Du Fu chose this place at the first sight when he came to Chengdu. In his poem &quot;Bu Ju&quot;, he praised &quot;at the west end of the Huanhua Stream, the owner is Bulintangyou&quot;. Later, due to the war in Chengdu, Du Fu, who had to flee the chaos in Zizhou &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (now Santai County, Sichuan)&lt;/span>;, was still writing &quot;Post a Question&quot; &quot;Jiangwai Thatched Cottage&quot; explains the original intention of settling by the Huanhua Stream, which is: &quot;I have a wild nature, and I want to escape from nature. I am addicted to wine and love bamboos, and I must live in the forest and springs.&quot; Today, by the Huanhua Stream, the Mian bamboos are slender, and the loving bamboos are kind. , bamboo cages are everywhere, and it is quiet everywhere. Being among them makes you forget your worries. As the upper reaches of Jinjiang River, Huanhua Creek has an ecological aesthetic quality. &quot;Fish come out in the drizzle, and swallows slant in the breeze.&quot; These natural beauties described by Du Fu in the Tang Dynasty can still be experienced frequently today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Tang Dynasty, if you took the waterway, you could take a boat from Huanhua River and turn into the Yangtze River to reach the south of the Yangtze River. Yes, it&#39;s Jiangnan. In his youth, Du Fu traveled to Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Shaoxing and other ancient places of Wu and Yue. He has never forgotten the landscape of Jiangnan, such as the Qinhuai River in the sound of oars and the Cao&#39;e River under the awning boat. As the saying goes, &quot;Missing&quot; &quot;Wu Sheng Shi Fan&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (Part 2 of &quot;Two Poems on Zizhou Climbing the Tower in Spring&quot;)&lt;/span>;, I often feel that &quot;the Yan River is beautiful and unique, You can’t forget it if you want to stop”&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(&quot;The Grand Tour&quot;)&lt;/span>;. Even when he came to settle in such an elegant and peaceful Huanhua River, and decided to live here forever, Du Fu would still think about it from time to time, except in the last sentence of &quot;Bu Ju&quot;, &quot;Thousands of miles eastward to enjoy the pleasure, one must go to the mountain shade in a small boat&quot;, In the last sentence of &quot;Quequatrains&quot;, &quot;The window contains the snow of Qianqiu in the Xiling Mountains, and the door is docked with ships thousands of miles away from Dongwu&quot;, I recall the Wuyue landscape rooted deep in my brain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the mountains and rivers of Wuyue and Bashan and Shu are the sources of Du Fu’s landscape poetry. In particular, the Jinjiang River in Chengdu and the Yangtze River in Chongqing also helped Du Fu reach the pinnacle of Chinese five-rhythm and seven-rhythm poetry, such as his famous five-rhythm poem &quot;Spring Night Joyful Rain&quot;, &quot;Look at the red and wet places at dawn, and the flowers are heavy in Jinguancheng&quot;, and his seven-rhythm poem. The famous poem &quot;Ascend the High&quot; &quot;The endless falling trees rustle down, and the endless Yangtze River rolls in&quot;. And as soon as he left Chengdu, Huanhua Creek became the most beautiful Jinjiang that Du Fu never forgot in Kuizhou &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (today&#39;s Fengjie County, Chongqing)&lt;/span>; on the Yangtze River. , for example, in &quot;Two Poems on Huaijin Water&quot;, one of them says, &quot;The water of Wu Gorge is coming towards Wu Gorge, and the waves of Jinjiang River are far away.&quot; Another example is that in &quot;Five Poems of Generals,&quot; the fifth one also says, &quot;The spring beauty of Jinjiang River drives people to Wu Gorge.&quot; Qingqiu mourns thousands of people.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Since ancient times, I have been traveling in captivity, why should I be sad?&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(&quot;Chengdu Mansion&quot;)&lt;/span>; made Du Fu let go for a time Ji Lv is sad, thanks to Chengdu and Huanhua Creek in Chengdu. Chengdu and Jinjiang also have to thank Du Fu for his poetic talent of &quot;not surprising even if his words are not surprising&quot;. All this is, of course, because the sparkling Huanhua Creek provided Du Fu with a stable habitat. In the spring of 760, Du Fu was very satisfied with the thatched hut built by Huanhua Stream. He immediately wrote a poem &quot;Tangcheng&quot;: &quot;The back of the Guotang is shaded by white grass, and the road along the edge of the river overlooks the green suburbs. The alder forest blocks the sun and sings in the wind. Leaves, bamboo cages and smoke dripping from the dew tips. The flying crows will stop to count their eggs, and the swallows will come frequently to make new nests. Others mistakenly compare Yang Xiong&#39;s house, and he is lazy and has no intention of making fun of it.&quot; Since childhood, Du Fu said that he had a talent similar to Yang Xiong&#39;s. His talent and poetic talent were no less than those of Cao Zhi. Suddenly someone mistook his thatched cottage for Yang Xiong&#39;s old residence. What else needed to be explained? From then on, in addition to traveling to other places, he basically spent time on the riverside looking for flowers, asking for willows, meeting friends, drinking, farming, and growing medicine. He kept looking at Jinjiang from various perspectives and copying it. From the time I arrived in Chengdu in the winter of 759, I felt uncomfortable writing &quot;Chengdu Mansion&quot; because of &quot;the bustling city, playing the flute and the sheng&quot;. By the time I left Chengdu in the summer of 765, I wrote &quot;Go to Shu&quot; with tears in my eyes. ”, Du Fu wrote more than 200 poems during the 6 years he lived here. Almost every poem will be poetically inspired by Jinjiang. He wrote this repeatedly, and on the day he left, he finally turned Jinjiang into a river of poetry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/18/M2eXRG3uRZHUoae2J4hQkpVcalSEhI4McWxY0ezz.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/18/M2eXRG3uRZHUoae2J4hQkpVcalSEhI4McWxY0ezz.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;205683&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The upper reaches of Jinjiang River: Huanhua Creek&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Peng Zhiqiang/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, Du Fu’s worship Visitors and followers came from different dynasties one after another, and they were in an endless stream on both sides of the Jinjiang River. The rising and falling sounds of poetry can be heard everywhere. Zhang Ji is here, and his &quot;Chengdu Song&quot; is very lively in Chengdu dialect. The picture is: &quot;The smoke and water are green near the west of Jinjiang River, and the lychees are ripe at the top of the Xinyu Mountain. There are many restaurants near the Wanli Bridge, and tourists love to stay in whoever they want to stay at.&quot; Su Shi is here, After struggling in officialdom for many years, he was demoted to Huangzhou. His memories of Jinjiang are full of nostalgia, such as in &quot;The Red River: Sent to Ezhou Zhu Envoy Jun Shouchang&quot;: &quot;Coming west from Jianghan, the grapes under the tall buildings are deep green. I still bring them with me. Min&#39;e snow waves, the spring scenery of Jinjiang. You are the beloved guardian of Nanshan, and I miss the return guest outside the sword.&quot; Lu You came. He loved Jinjiang, especially the plum blossoms on both sides of Jinjiang. It can be said that &quot;Ten years of horse racing along the Jinjiang River&quot;. For ten years, he was &quot;on Jinjiang Road in front of Qingyang Palace, and I was drunk by plum blossoms for ten years.&quot; In his later years, the lingering aftertaste is still: &quot;Back then, when I walked to the west of Jincheng, I was drunk by plum blossoms. For twenty miles, the fragrance continued. , Qingyang Palace to Huanhua Stream.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jinjiang starts from the intersection of Huanhua Stream and Modi River in the northeast of Caotang Primary School, all the way from west to east, passing Baihuatan, Jinguan Bridge, Rainbow Bridge, Wanli Bridge to Hejiang Pavilion, this section of the river is also called Nanhe. This is the only river that Du Fu must pass when leaving Chengdu in his later years, and it is also the spring river that Li Bai sang on the Sanhua Tower in his youth &quot;Building&quot; &quot;Evening rain goes to the Three Gorges, and the Spring River flows around the two streams&quot;)&lt;/span>;, during which time, we go retrograde from the Sanhua Building in Baihua Pond to the Shuangxian Bridge Antique Market on the bank of Huanhua Creek. There are also Yuxian Bridge, Wangxian Bridge, and Wangxian Bridge. Send Xianqiao. The Nanhe River starting from Huanhua Stream winds and meanders without any rush until it meets the Fuhe River running from north to south at Hejiang Pavilion. At the confluence of the two rivers, waves suddenly bloom, gradually returning to their turbulent nature originating from the Minjiang River. From there, he quickly rushed to Jiuyan Bridge, Wangjiang Tower, and Huanglong River, and returned to the mainstream of the Minjiang River near the Jiangkou Chenyin Site in Pengshan, Meishan, and went straight into the Yangtze River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My inspection of Jinjiang this time came along the Fuhe River with a group, and then I went back home alone from the Nanhe River. Although I have witnessed the spectacular confluence of the Nanhe River and the Fuhe River many times before, they are still there. The scene of hugging each other and recognizing relatives in Hejiang Pavilion is still seen often. It made me get to know Jinjiang and myself again. It seemed casual but in fact I was very committed to the original intention of living in Jinjiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/18/KdIn6CHecKafSHgXLMXmlpAEABQhI0PHW8DAAGfb.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/18/KdIn6CHecKafSHgXLMXmlpAEABQhI0PHW8DAAGfb.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;205679&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;South Section of Jinjiang River&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Peng Zhiqiang/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Jin Ruo Shu Jin&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Amazing, tolerant and with a bright future, this is the third face of Jinjiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First trace the whereabouts of the Baitiao River, a tributary of the Minjiang River. In fact, like the Zouma River, it also goes all the way east and divides many times in the north of Chengdu. The sub-rivers include Pihe, Dongfengqu, Shahe and Fuhe, among which , Fuhe River turns from north to east and then south into Chengdu City. Compared with the Zouma River, the Baitiao River has a greater mission. Especially in the Tang Dynasty, it passed under the Chengdu City and became a moat, protecting Chengdu from good weather and protecting Chengdu&#39;s prosperity for thousands of years. This section of the Baitiao River flows through and protects Chengdu Fucheng, so it is named Fucheng. Li Bai said in No. 7 of &quot;Ten Songs of the Emperor&#39;s Western Tour of Nanjing&quot; that in the Tang Dynasty, this moat was &quot;Jinshui flows eastward around Jincheng, and the star bridge hangs like a star in the north.&quot; This moat, which has been changed many times but still protects the city of Chengdu, is the Fu River that now meets the Nan River at Hejiang Pavilion. Yes, Fuhe was regarded as &quot;Jinshui&quot; by Li Bai, and Nanhe, which originally referred to Jinjiang, was also &quot;Jinshui&quot; in Du Fu&#39;s eyes. For example, &quot;Dan Ge Xing presented Wang Lang Sizhi&quot; said, &quot;The princes from the west drank Jinshui. Where do you want to go to get your pearls and shoes?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fuhe River and Nanhe River, the two &quot;Jinshui&quot; surrounding the city, were once collectively known as Funan River. They were the gushing mother river among the Chengdu population. Fuhe and Nanhe, which have the same origin as the Minjiang River, are both &quot;Jinshui&quot;. Since they are collectively called Funanhe, why not call them both &quot;Jinjiang&quot;? Jinjiang, as its name suggests, is a river with a bright future. In 2005, with the approval of the Sichuan Provincial Government, Fuhe and Nanhe in the urban section of Chengdu were officially collectively called Jinjiang. After all, both Fuhe and Nanhe have made great efforts in flowing through, protecting and prospering Chengdu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let’s talk about another important cultural source of Jinjiang: Shu Brocade. The history of Chengdu&#39;s construction has been more than 2,300 years since Zhang Yi built the city after the Qin State annexed the Shu State. Since Li Bing diverted the Minjiang River into the Chengdu Plain, Chengdu has been constantly changing the course of the river entering the city. It has been accumulating power like water since the Qin Dynasty. This power is the driving force that Shu brocade brings to Chengdu&#39;s economic prosperity. In fact, sericulture and brocade weaving have been the living customs of the ancestors of Shu since ancient times. By the Western Han Dynasty when the brocade industry was developed, the Shu brocade produced in Chengdu was sold all over the country and became famous because of its exquisite craftsmanship, variety of colors, and wide range of uses. In 2012, four Shu brocade Jacquard loom models were unearthed from archaeological excavations at the Laoguanshan Han Tomb in Chengdu. Their dates all point to the Western Han Dynasty. They are the most complete loom models from the Western Han Dynasty discovered in my country so far and the earliest Jacquard loom in the world so far. Model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to legend, as early as the Han Dynasty, the imperial court set up officials in Chengdu to manage brocades full-time and named them &quot;Jin Officials&quot;. During the Shu-Han Period of the Three Kingdoms, Prime Minister Zhuge Liang restored the &quot;Jin Officials&quot; to solve the problems during the war in one fell swoop. Due to the economic and military expenditure problems of the Shu Kingdom, Chengdu gained the reputation of &quot;Jincheng City&quot; and &quot;Jincheng City&quot;. When Du Fu was living in Chengdu, he wrote &quot;The Prime Minister of Shu&quot;, &quot;Where can I find the ancestral hall of the Prime Minister? There are so many trees outside Jinguan City&quot;, and &quot;Spring Night Joyful Rain&quot;, &quot;Looking at the red and wet place at dawn, the flowers are heavy in Jinguan City&quot;, which illustrates the Jinguan City in the Tang Dynasty. The ruins of the city are still there, and its official office is probably on the Jinjiang River between Rainbow Bridge and Wanli Bridge. In the Tang Dynasty, Chengdu, formerly known as Shu County and Yizhou, experienced great development in Shu Brocade and other handicraft industries. In addition, the Chengdu Plain nurtured by the Minjiang River was rich in rice and other grains. It became a more prosperous city than Chang&#39;an and Luoyang. It is known in history as &quot;Yang one benefits two&quot;, which means that Chengdu&#39;s economic power is second only to Yangzhou, which is known as a land of plenty and a canal hub. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I say Jinjiang is as stunning as Sichuan Brocade because it is really brightened by Sichuan Brocade. According to the fifth record of Liu Yuxi&#39;s &quot;Nine Poems on the Waves and Waves on the Sand&quot;: &quot;The flowers on both sides of the Zhuojin River are washed by the spring breeze. The girl cuts off the mandarin duck brocade and sets the sunset glow in the middle.&quot; In the poem, Liu Yuxi vividly describes a Tang Dynasty A scene of Chengdu women washing Sichuan brocade in Jinjiang River. There is also Li Bai. Even when he was sentenced to Changliu Yelang in Xunyang, he still missed the Jinjiang River in Chengdu that was washed by Shu Jinhuan. Sixth of his &quot;Ten Songs of the Emperor&#39;s Western Tour of Nanjing&quot; said, &quot;The Qingjiang River flows thousands of miles.&quot; , Yunfan and dragon sailed down to Yangzhou.&quot; In the Tang Dynasty, the Jinjiang River was wide, running thousands of miles, and full of heroism. Why was the word &quot;毯&quot; added before &quot;Jinjiang&quot;? Because Jinjiang is also known as Zhuojin River and Zhuojin River. Zhuo Jin, the brocade color is fresher and more moist than usual, hence the name. The washing of Shu brocade by the Jinjiang River did not begin in the Tang Dynasty. Since about the Western Han Dynasty, Shu people have loved to wash the Shu brocade cut by textiles in the Huanhua River. Later generations euphemistically called this &quot;Zhuo brocade&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How could Du Fu, who lives in Huanhua Creek in the upper reaches of Jinjiang River, not know the legend of &quot;Zhuojinjiang River&quot;, as stated in &quot;Xiao Baming&#39;s Mansion Really Looking for Peach Plants&quot;, &quot;Although there are countless in Heyang County, the gardens along Zhuojinjiang River are not full.&quot; Zeng explained that during the Anshi Rebellion, there was a shortage of peach trees in Huanhuaxi, so he went to Xiao Baming&#39;s Mansion to find new peaches to plant. When Du Fu first arrived in Chengdu, he mainly made a living by farming and growing medicines, and his family often relied on Lumi from friends such as Gao Shi and Yan Wu. After that, he must also be dressed in brocade clothes, which he often washes in the Jinjiang River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The greatest inheritance today of using Sichuan brocade to wash the Jinjiang River is probably the naming of a county-level district after Jinjiang. In 1990, Chengdu abolished Dongcheng District and reorganized its main part into Jinjiang District. The name of the district comes from the Sichuan culture of &quot;Zhuo Jinjiang&quot; that has been passed down orally for thousands of years in the poems of great poets such as Li Bai, Du Fu, and Liu Yuxi. In the Qin Dynasty, the location of Jinjiang District was called Chengdu County, which was the core urban area of ​​Shu County at this time. In the Tang Dynasty, whether Chengdu County was renamed Shu County or Huayang County, it was still Chengdu Prefecture&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (the capital of the Tang Dynasty &quot;Nanjing&quot; after the An-Shi Rebellion )&lt;/span>;’s core urban area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/18/mQVSufFdiyFuBN4jinfzt7rVA7pEN5fEb2pQgy54.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;604&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/18/mQVSufFdiyFuBN4jinfzt7rVA7pEN5fEb2pQgy54.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;205681&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Anshun Covered Bridge on Jinjiang River&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jinjiang River, from The &quot;Zhuo Jinjiang River&quot; that flows from the Min River to wash the city of Chengdu not only incubates Jinjiang District, but also flows southward from Hejiang Pavilion in Jinjiang District into the High-tech Zone, Shuangliu District, and Tianfu New District, continuing to expand Chengdu&#39;s arteries. Even like me, a &quot;Rong Piao&quot; who has lived for 25 years, was able to establish a business in the Jinjiangfu River section and then settle down in the Jinjiang South River section. It can be said that I was first inspired by Du Fu&#39;s poetic Jinjiang, and ultimately it was because of the economic boom. Given by Jinjiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On a summer evening, the colorful clouds turned the face over Chengdu red, and also reflected the Jinjiang River passing through the city red. As the night gradually opened and the lanterns started to light up, I strolled along the Hejiang Pavilion on the Jinjiang River and returned to the upstream Huanhua Stream. I fell asleep on the Sichuan Brocade pillow late at night. I thought that I would never be able to stay away from the Jinjiang River for the rest of my life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[走出村小的学生正在服务杭州亚运，让我看到教育的意义]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258148]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-06 21:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holiday will give you a few days to spare. While watching the replay video of the opening ceremony of the Hangzhou Asian Games, I remembered that Xiao Yang, who I had been in contact with before and was now in Hangzhou, might be serving the Asian Games as a volunteer at this time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I immediately sent her a message, but it took a few hours for me to receive her reply: She was on rest during service, not in the library, but still busy... Finally, while she was resting During the break, I learned that she was working with several other volunteers this time to provide information consultation for athletes in the e-sports stadium, issue game passes, arrange for athletes to enter the lounge, and check-in matters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at some of the live pictures and work photos of the e-sports stadium that she posted on her WeChat Moments, the more I looked at them carefully, the less I could recall too many scenes of her as a primary school student. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She was the first group of students I taught when I became a teacher ten years ago. At that time, compared with other students in the class, she was not necessarily very cheerful and lively, but she was serious, studious, and careful enough. She was selected as a &quot;study committee member&quot; very early. She lived right across from the school. Sometimes she would finish her homework in the classroom after school and then go home. She would also occasionally come to the school after dinner to chat with me and another young teacher who lived in the school. Although her grades in elementary school have always been among the best, even though she occasionally sent me holiday greetings after entering junior high school, and even though she heard my opinions when she filled in her application for the college entrance examination, I never imagined that the person who read the text aloud ten years ago A student who was not very loud and did not perform actively in public classes can now use fluent English to help e-sports players from different countries successfully enter the arena and complete the game and win their praise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What makes me even more moved is that the starting point for her volunteer service for the Asian Games was an extremely ordinary rural primary school, a primary school with less than 300 people, a sports ground on dirt... A student can pass After ten years of study and continuous hard work, I entered the city, entered the university, and entered the Asian Games e-sports stadium with a sense of technology and modernity. I used my enthusiasm and professional ability to contribute to the Asian Games. I have always been in a township school. In my opinion, it is simply a miracle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am not sure whether Xiao Yang could have imagined that he would have such a special situation when he was in elementary school ten years ago, high school five years ago, and college two years ago. But for me, a teacher who has taught her for two years, witnessed her growth, and followed her learning, there are too many surprises and too many gratifications. This surprise and relief was the result of seeing her continue to learn and receive education. It was so beautiful and good. Even the whole process and results were something that neither she nor I, who had experienced it, had ever imagined or expected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In my tenth year of teaching, many of my students have already entered the workplace early, some are still studying on university campuses, some are still preparing for the college entrance examination, and some have just entered junior high school. Whenever I wonder how much positive role I, as their teacher, have played in their growth and learning, Xiao Yang’s experience in serving the Asian Games should be the best answer I can give at the moment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a teacher in Suixian County, Suizhou City, Hubei Province)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010 ;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The &quot;hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of Southern Weekend App is looking forward to your contributions.

Since I left when I was very young, I have always regarded Pingxiang, Jiangxi, as my hometown. When I first heard that the capital of Anhui Province was called &quot;Hefei&quot;, I was as surprised as I was when I learned about the history of Pingxiang. Although this coal city in western Jiangxi is called &quot;Pingxiang&quot;, in fact, it has become a well-known industrial and mining city at home and abroad as early as the late Qing Dynasty with the rise of Anyuan Coal Mine; it is not only the birthplace of the Chinese workers&#39; movement, but also the autumn harvest. Why was the origin of the uprising named &quot;Pingxiang&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Isn’t it just Pingxiang? There are also many cities in China with interesting names. For example, the capital of Hebei Province is called &quot;Shijiazhuang&quot; and the famous porcelain capital of Jiangxi is called &quot;Jingdezhen&quot;. In the 1970s, a flood in the upper reaches of the Huaihe River washed out Henan Province. A prefecture-level city was named &quot;Zhumadian&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is either a town, a village, or a store. It is conceivable that most of these place names come from its history. But the combination of these two Chinese characters &quot;Hefei&quot; makes people feel strange. A cross talk once joked that it was &quot;two fat men sleeping&quot;. Later I learned that it got its name because it is located where the two Fei rivers in the north and south merge into Chaohu Lake. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first time I went to Anhui, or the first time to Hefei, was in May of 1993, when the flowers were blooming. At that time, I was still working in Pingxiang City. The two places were separated by more than a thousand kilometers. Because of the inconvenient transportation, Hefei felt like a distant existence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I spent two full days on that trip. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I set off early in the morning the day before. After taking the green train for most of the day, I first arrived in Nanchang and stayed at a small hotel near the long-distance bus station. The next day, I took a bus before dawn. Genius 1 bus bound for Hefei. Then, the car passed through countless villages and towns. The road was uneven and had potholes from time to time. After a day of bumps, the bones were falling apart. Lunch seemed to have been served at a roadside shop in Huangmei County, Hubei Province. It was probably the driver&#39;s personal designated restaurant. The food didn&#39;t look clean, and there was a strange taste in the mouth. This is nothing, the worst part is going to the &quot;bathroom&quot;. Although the car stopped twice during the journey, both times it stopped in the wilderness of Qianbuba Village and Hoububa Store; those two places were blocked. The sheds called &quot;public restrooms&quot; were only one person high and had no doors. The passengers were self-conscious at first and lined up at a distance, but the male compatriots who couldn&#39;t wait went to look for trees or grass that could provide shelter. To solve the problem, our female compatriots could only guard the toilet. The dirty floor in the toilet and the flying mosquitoes and flies made me retching uncontrollably. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order not to go to the toilet, I didn’t dare to drink a sip of water or take a sip of food along the way. By the time I arrived in Hefei, it was already dark and I was so hungry that my chest was touching my back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that terrible experience, I did not dare to return to my hometown. It was not until three years later that a railway was built between Hefei and Nanchang, and I began to return to my hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At first, this special line was not included in the national railway system and was only a local railway between Anhui and Jiangxi provinces. It starts from Hefei&#39;s West Railway Station, passes through Feixi, Lujiang, Shucheng, Tongcheng, Qianshan, Susong, and Wangjiang in Anhui Province, passes through Huangmei in Hubei Province, and then crosses the Yangtze River and enters Jiujiang and Yongxiu in Jiangxi Province. , and finally arrived in Nanchang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I do remember that the first time I boarded that southbound train was one morning at the end of 1996. At that time, our financial situation was still very difficult, and all we bought was a seat ticket. When my husband and I got into the car carrying large and small bags, we were surprised to find that there were very few passengers in the car. Although some people started to get on along the way, they were always sparse and there were so many empty spots that people could even lie down and sleep. Looking out the window at the rolling mountains, the sleeping fields under the winter sun, and the fleeting simple farmhouses, I felt mixed feelings. Fortunately, I no longer have to endure the pain of long-distance buses where I dare not even take a sip of water. Switching to a spacious and comfortable train, the time is shortened by nearly half. What is worrying is that there are too few passengers and the passenger flow is so small. Volume, let alone making money, whether the cost can be maintained is a question, and the economies of Anhui and Jiangxi provinces are still underdeveloped. If they are always losing money, can this train be saved? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This train arrived at the terminal, Nanchang, in the evening. Since there were no more trains to Pingxiang that day, we had to stay in Nanchang for one night. I remember we chose a hotel called &quot;Da Guangming&quot; on Zhanqian Road. &quot;Da Guangming&quot; is a small hotel. The rooms are poorly furnished and there is no separate bathroom. A very funny thing happened in &quot;Great Light&quot; that day, and even today, twenty-six years later, I still remember it fresh. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While packing the luggage the next morning, my husband suddenly discovered that an envelope containing 3,000 yuan in cash was missing! The door was locked and the windows were bolted, so it was impossible for outsiders to come in and steal. But after searching every corner of the room, as well as the corridors and public toilets outside, nothing was found. My husband then went downstairs to find the waiter, and soon a hotel security guard came up. He said that only the two of us lived on the entire floor that day, and even if it fell on the corridor, it would not be picked up by anyone. What he meant was that the envelope could only be left in the room. So, in front of him, I took off the quilt cover, lifted the sheets, took out the items in the box one by one, and rummaged through them again, but there was still nothing. At this time, my husband made a request to him, &quot;Maybe I accidentally dropped it into the toilet when I was convenient and it was washed away. Can you take me to the sewer to have a look?&quot; The man did not refuse. He agreed, &quot;It is possible. Not long ago, a traveler dropped a watch and found it in the sewer. There were not many people staying in the hotel last night, and the water from the sewer should still be accumulated downstairs. I will take you Go down and look for it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With a glimmer of hope, we followed him downstairs. He took out an iron rod with a hook from a corner, led us around to the small courtyard behind the hotel, and opened two The iron plate, underneath is the sewer. He bent over and rolled up his sleeves, completely ignoring the stench coming from the sewer. He held the iron rod and carefully raked it back and forth little by little. After raking it out three or four times, he still found nothing. He smiled at us apologetically: &quot;Nothing either!&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;If I really can’t find it, I can only admit that I am unlucky. We left &quot;Da Guangming&quot; sadly, took the train back to Pingxiang, and stayed at Dadi&#39;s house at night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That year, my eldest brother was allocated a new apartment. This money was originally a gift to him, but unexpectedly something unexpected happened, so he had to owe it first. Unexpectedly, when my husband went to bed at night, he took off the black woolen jacket and something fell from his sleeve, and it was not the envelope containing the money! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for how the envelope slipped into the sleeves, there is no way to verify it; he didn’t even notice it when he was getting dressed, and he didn’t even notice when he put it all the way around, which shows that he doesn’t care about such trivial matters in life. He is a careless person. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While I was blaming his Madaha for giving me a false alarm, I was also full of guilt for the Da Guangming Hotel. Think about it, in the middle of winter, I had to dig out the gutter early in the morning, and I still looked unhappy when I left. I always thought that the money was lost in the hotel, and I even suspected that the waiter had picked it up! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, the Daguangming Hotel and the tall security guard have been deeply engraved in my mind. Even after our economic conditions improved, I still chose to stay in &quot;Da Guangming&quot; every time I was in transit from Nanchang. Once, my son had a high fever in the middle of the night, but I did not panic and gave him medicine calmly because I believed that this hotel would definitely lend a helping hand if needed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few years later, this Anhui-Jiangxi line was integrated into the national railway network. The trains from Hefei to Nanchang were also extended from Nanchang to Guangzhou, and a pair of trains to Dongguan were also added. There are many trains to choose from, but both trains depart from Hefei at noon or evening, and arrive in Nanchang either in the evening or in the middle of the night; and the train from Nanchang to Hefei departs in the early morning, either in the middle of the night or in the early morning. When traveling between Hefei and my hometown, I still have to stay one night in Nanchang. I have been riding this kind of train for more than ten years, so I have stayed at the Daguangming Hotel no less than forty times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although I don’t have a good impression of Nanchang Railway Station. Every time I leave the station, there will be a number of people holding signs to solicit guests to stay in the hotel, and they will keep pestering you; in front of the station When dining in a small restaurant, if you don&#39;t agree on the price in advance, sometimes you will be charged an exorbitant price, and you will have to consider yourself unlucky if you get ripped off, because those people are very rude and seem to be ready to use their fists at any time. Fortunately, this hotel prevented us from being too disappointed in this city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About 2010, my journey back home changed again: Hefei opened two direct trains to the southwest, one to Kunming and one to Nanning; Both trains pass through my hometown. The former departs in the morning and arrives in the evening, while the latter departs in the morning and arrives in the evening. The time it takes to reach Pingxiang does not exceed twelve hours. From then on, my journey back to my hometown suddenly became very smooth. I no longer needed to change trains midway. I only had to buy a sleeper ticket, get on the train from Hefei after dinner, and sleep all the way to Pingxiang in time for breakfast the next day; or I was still in Hefei in the morning, and before the sun went down, I came to the streets of Pingxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the convenient transportation, the number of times I return to my hometown has naturally increased. It used to be once or twice a year, but now it has become several times. Something happened at home. I got a call the day before and I arrived early the next morning. It used to be difficult to meet my classmates and friends from my hometown, but now it is easy to meet once or twice a year. Whenever there is a school anniversary or class celebration event, as long as I can spare the time, I will rush back to join in the fun. , although I have been away from home for more than 20 years, my former classmates and friends have miraculously recovered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This Spring Festival, my husband and I went back to our hometown to visit my mother. When we purchased tickets online, we unexpectedly discovered that the train from Hefei to Kunming suddenly disappeared; the train to Nanning was also absent. Pingxiang stopped. But at the same time, I was even more surprised to find that there is a high-speed rail connection between Hefei and Nanchang! Moreover, the high-speed rail departs six times a day, and the whole journey takes just over two hours! Then, I also discovered that the passenger train that used to operate between Anhui and Jiangxi had also returned, but it had also changed from the earlier green train to a motor train, and the time was greatly shortened to two hours and forty minutes! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At around 12 noon on the fifth day of the Lunar New Year, my husband and I boarded the train. Looking at the wilderness and farmhouses passing by outside the window, my mood suddenly returned to the unstoppable excitement I felt when I first took the train back to my hometown twenty-six years ago. In my impression, the speed of the green train at that time was only 60 kilometers per hour, and in order to prevent thermal expansion and contraction, there were gaps at the joints of each section of the rail. When the wheels passed by, a clear and audible &quot;thumping thump&quot; would be emitted from underneath the train. The sound of &quot;thump, thump, thump&quot; is especially loud when people are quiet at night; and now the speed of high-speed trains has reached more than 200 kilometers per hour. People sitting on the train can no longer hear the sound of wheels hitting the rails. It is so smooth that even the water in the cup can&#39;t be heard. It didn&#39;t move at all. As you can imagine, the rails today are obviously seamless. There are only twenty-six years before and after. Twenty-six years is not a long time, but it is enough to give birth to a generation. It is only a blink of an eye. In the past twenty-six years, China&#39;s railway transportation has indeed undergone earth-shaking changes. . In terms of speed alone, there used to be only local trains or express trains, but at the beginning of the 20th century, there were express trains and direct trains. By the 2008 Olympic Games, the first intercity high-speed rail line appeared between Beijing and Tianjin. The municipalities have implemented high-speed rail and public transportation, and it only takes half an hour to travel to and from each other. In terms of color, in the past, local trains were always green, while in the transition to express trains, there were red and blue. Later, high-speed trains and high-speed trains were all white. Now, high-speed trains have spread all over the country, and only Anhui Province has done so. Arrive at Shishitong High Speed ​​Rail. So, I discovered that the colors of the cars have been adjusted again: except for the high-speed trains, all ordinary passenger cars have returned to the previous green color. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Green is the color of spring, which makes you feel refreshed and full of vitality. Of course, the bigger change is that today&#39;s rail transit has switched from burning coal to using electricity. This is a change of the times. It has not only become faster, but also cleaner and more environmentally friendly! So, I am guessing what kind of new energy will be used to drive high-speed rail and high-speed trains in the future? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I searched on the Internet with great interest and found out that the high-speed railway between Nanchang and Hefei was officially opened to traffic this year, that is, in January 2022. I was earlier. One of the passengers who enjoys this benefit. There were not many passengers on the train that day. Just like the first time I took the local railway, most of the seats were empty. But I no longer have the worries I had back then, because the reason why there are so few passengers this time is not due to passenger volume, but due to the COVID-19 epidemic. Everyone is responding to the government’s call and trying not to travel if possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;High-speed rail not only greatly shortens the time compared to ordinary trains, but the convenience of transfer is also a major advantage. I have transferred at Tianjin West Railway Station in a municipality directly under the Central Government, and at Bengbu South Railway Station in a prefecture-level city. Both times I could transfer without leaving the station. This time, the train entered Nanchang West Station. We got off the train and followed the &quot;Convenient Transfer&quot; signs to get on the elevator of the station&#39;s overpass. We crossed the overpass and entered the waiting room directly. Because there are as many as 26 high-speed trains running from Nanchang West to Pingxiang North every day, we only stayed at the station for a short time and completed the transfer easily. An hour later, we ended our journey back to our hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thinking about it, all this is incredible: from Hefei, between the Jianghuai River and the Huaihe River, to Pingxiang, the coal capital of western Jiangxi, the trip used to take two days and one night, but now it only takes four hours. Such speed was something I couldn&#39;t even dream of before. Many people have watched &quot;Water Margin&quot; and know that Dai Zong, the magical Taibo in it, can travel a thousand miles in a day and eight hundred miles at night. Everyone thinks that is just a myth. But with China&#39;s high-speed rail now, why does it take one day to travel a thousand miles? Two or three hours is enough! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, the journey back to my hometown can be said to be a kind of enjoyment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 20:55:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
