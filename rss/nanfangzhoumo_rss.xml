For example, most men retain the hobbies of their youth, such as games, toys, sports, and crafts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, &quot;A man remains a boy until he dies&quot; is a comment full of life philosophy. It is simply &quot;measured&quot; by a group of men who have experienced the cruel beatings of society but can always stand up in the world. &quot;Customized&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A foreign talk show actor said in an interview that eating pizza and drinking wine, sitting in front of the TV watching football games, scolding the referee, just spending a happy time alone, never mind What a blessing. When asked if he was tired from watching so many football games in a week, he replied: &quot;Not tired at all, because I am the kind of simple-minded man who can get happiness just by sitting and watching football games.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;So, &quot;Will you watch football games with your wife?&quot; His answer was: &quot;No, she has a complicated mind and it is difficult to focus on one thing. Some women feel unhappy every day because of this.&quot; A bit. He complained about his wife. However, one fact is good: differences in preferences between men and women exist objectively, and many times, this difference is also interesting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A male respondent on Zhihu said that there were a bunch of things in his online shopping list that he wanted to buy but knew were useless, and a wooden stick costing more than ten yuan came second. After getting the stick, he put glue on his hands and brought it to the unit. The female colleague asked him why he bought it. He said he just wanted to buy it, but she didn&#39;t understand. This seems to mean that a dozen yuan is money, and it is not a waste to buy a handful of green onions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He asserted: &quot;I&#39;ll just put the stick here. Do you think any man will come over and not play with it?&quot; As a result, six or seven people played with the stick in the afternoon. She couldn&#39;t understand it, so he gave it to her. Her husband sent a photo, and after a while her husband replied: This stick is great! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The respondent lamented that this stick can kill boys from a few years old to several decades old, but as long as a boy sees something he played with when he was a child, he will immediately and seamlessly pick it up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I also have personal experience of this. I played seal carving when I was thirteen and learned a lot. Although I slacked off a bit when I reached middle age, my hobby of sharpening stones remained. As long as you see the carving knife and the seal stone, you will feel warm in your heart. If you pick up the stone and sharpen it, you will experience the non-utilitarian joy. Not long ago, my parents-in-law listened to my suggestion and built a &quot;grindstone&quot; for me in a chicken coop in the countryside. I often put away my mundane things and concentrate on grinding stones here. While grinding the stone, the chickens are walking and the insects are chirping, and the wind is blowing and the leaves are falling, so I feel at ease. At that moment, this ultimate tranquility with nothing to worry about and no rush for five buckets of rice was charming and magical. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the final analysis, the reason why many men can remain teenagers until they die is that they have always experienced the essence of simple happiness. Not to mention that things worth more than ten yuan can make them happy. Even worthless things, such as a branch or a stone picked up from the Gobi Desert, can make them immersed in it and play with it for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many of the real happiness does not cost money. A good friend who graduated from Peking University told me that he likes physics and mathematics and is very happy every time he looks at it online. One of my old leaders also likes to sit for a while at work after work late at night and play against Go masters on the Internet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have noticed the chess players and chess watchers in a small street called Hongmiao near my work. Unless it rains heavily, they all play and watch chess on old tables on the street. As the chess game changes, , sometimes they are nervous and &quot;dare not speak loudly&quot;, sometimes they are cheerful and cheerful. I have been here for more than ten years, so I have carefully noticed that there are always only a few people playing chess and watching chess. Over the years, apart from their older faces, their happy expressions have not changed at all. Is that chess game about money? About reputation? About status? Not really. They are just &quot;stealing half a day&#39;s leisure.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Writer Wang Zengqi also wrote a story about an old man who was selfless and wonderful at making noodles and fish, praising him as a &quot;living Zhuangzi&quot;. The essence of the so-called &quot;living Zhuangzi&quot; is not &quot;profound&quot;, but the far-reaching and unrestrained imagery. The same goes for those &quot;fishing friends&quot; who sit by the quiet and deserted river all day long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, the vast majority of men cannot remain isolated from the world, and they are burdened by fame and fortune. But after entering middle-aged and old age, many men suddenly realize that since their jobs and ranks are just like that, the heights they can reach in their lifetime are also like that. Let go of what you can’t get, leaving a pure world for yourself to live a better life. Simple and more innocent, wouldn&#39;t it be better? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of consideration is a reflection of simple character. When a man has thought through his personal honor and disgrace, as well as the gains and losses in life, the rest will become much simpler. Therefore, getting pleasure from getting along with yourself has become a daily task. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Getting along with oneself is, in a sense, the most difficult thing. If a person always has unrealistic goals and is always competing with himself, then the quality of his life will be very bad and his personality will be easily torn. Of course, if a person always has unrealistic goals (for his spouse) out of a desire to compare, and urges his spouse to &quot;work hard&quot; to make more money and have power, then the quality of this kind of relationship will be It will be terrible and it will be difficult for the family to get along. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, if a person can realize that at a certain stage of life, he is not pursuing what is happiness, and can maintain a normal mind, it will be easy for his own &quot;shadow&quot; to be created by himself. Infected by the natural interest, they can truly integrate together and make themselves stronger and more calm. If family members are more understanding or are such people, the family will be more harmonious and harmonious. This kind of freedom, relaxation, selflessness, and enjoyment are very different from the comparison fueled by consumerism that can easily lead to pain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People are inevitably disturbed by desires, but people still have to work hard to achieve a balanced relationship with themselves. Childlike innocence is still a very common but supreme state. Its basis is a strong disposition, the true meaning of happiness. In the final analysis, many men&#39;s respect for &quot;simple happiness&quot; represents a group&#39;s objective evaluation of their own value and a neither humble nor arrogant attitude towards &quot;the outside world&quot;. It continues the childlike innocence of individuals and makes secular life a little more tranquil. of interest. This is the secret of a man hidden in &quot;Till he is a boy until his death.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[刺客模式丨意长意短]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256930]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/18/IoH3LnypZUwNhU91O62T9wKXgOBVpGdB4mr6Axlw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2048&quot; height=&quot;1365&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/IoH3LnypZUwNhU91O62T9 wKXgOBVpGdB4mr6Axlw. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251102&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Saint-Lazare Metro Regional Express (RER) station in Paris, France. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When living in the countryside, there is no time to rush to get angry, it is just to rush out to collect when it rains heavily. clothes, or close windows that let in water. But going into the city is different, especially since there are so many anxious moments in Paris, such as catching a car or a flight. At that moment, I usually turn on the &quot;Assassin Mode&quot; and constantly remind myself: Concentrate and go straight to the goal, so as not to delay things. For example, one morning, I made an appointment with a friend from China who was visiting an art museum, and we had breakfast together in her hotel. I went out and found that it was already a little late. I was going to take bus 72 to the Louvre Museum. I saw bus 72 passing in front of me. It was still 500 meters away from the next stop. While the car was waiting at the traffic light, I ran forward in one breath, hoping to catch up before the car reached the next stop. I ran about a hundred meters when the bus driver caught up with me and honked the horn for me to get on the bus. After I got on, everyone in the car looked at me with sympathy. They must be thinking, this woman is really a bit hard-working. I was a little confused for a moment, thanked the master, and swiped my card in a hurry. In fact, I didn’t expect that the harder work would come later. When I took the plane back to China, I realized that every second counts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I first planned to go by car, and everything was arranged in an orderly manner. My friend Mike is an Italian petty bourgeoisie living in Paris (Li Piao is keen on shopping in supermarkets, saving points, and discovering various money-saving strategies). He has never taken me to the airport because he used to drive a diesel car with pollution level 5, which could not be driven except on weekends. Now that he has a new car with pollution level 2, which is ready to go on the road at any time, he enthusiastically said that he would give it to me. And the timing was coincidental, he got off work at five o&#39;clock and we set off at five twenty. My flight is at 9:20, so I leave four hours early. Charles de Gaulle Airport is only 30 kilometers away from where I live, so I should be there in an hour. I thought about it and thought it was appropriate. At five o&#39;clock, I went to a nearby shop and bought a bowl of fish fillet rice bowl. It was topped with a layer of tuna and salmon. It was not soupy and watery. It could be enjoyed before boarding the plane, so there was no need to eat on the plane. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We set off at almost half past five. The atmosphere was relaxed, listening to music, talking and laughing. The first few kilometers were pretty smooth. Once on the ring road, the road was basically like a parking lot. Only motorcycles were speeding in the gaps between cars. Ambulances and police cars passed one by one, and the cars on both sides gave way. I looked out the window and thought about what&#39;s so good about a big city. It&#39;s so chaotic. But I really had plenty of time, so I tried to relax. The radio in the car played the soothing, melancholy and melodious singing of jazz singer Bilie Holiday, which was like a massage for the soul. It was about a woman. Crazy for love, you can move mountains and so on for love. Mike said it would be nice if you were a homeless person living under a bridge and didn&#39;t have to rush back to work. I want that too, but I like soft beds, I love my job, and I have to rush back to work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We were stuck in traffic on the ring road for an hour and planned to get off, but when we got to the side road, the car stopped there, unable to move forward or backward. On the map, the entire city&#39;s routes were red, and I waited until almost seven o&#39;clock. I looked out the window, and there were cars all around me. I became more and more panicked. I began to imagine the tragic situation of being expelled from school because I couldn&#39;t catch up with class. Even the brisk jazz tunes couldn&#39;t calm my mood. The city outside the window seemed like It&#39;s getting more and more aggressive, and the blue sky and white clouds seem hollow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mike was at a loss, so he took out a ticket from his wallet and said to me: &quot;You get off here and go straight to Line 4. From there you take the bus to North Station and then take the RER express.&quot; , Line B to Charles de Gaulle, it takes an hour to get to the airport. This area is very chaotic, be careful with your wallet and mobile phone. Are you ready?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was not ready, but I got off the bus bravely , if there were any mistakes in the middle and I couldn&#39;t make it within an hour, I would have missed my flight. But if I sit in the car and wait, I will definitely miss my flight. I grabbed my luggage from the trunk (I was glad I had four wheels) and sped down the bike path like an antelope being chased by a lion on the grassland. I turned on &quot;assassin mode&quot; while running, with the goal of getting to the airport within an hour. I am glad that I wear sneakers and have good physical strength like a retired athlete. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The beginning went well. I was standing in the subway station, hesitating where to get off. An old lady said loudly: &quot;It&#39;s the same on both sides.&quot; As soon as I got underground, there was a subway waiting with its door open. Before going up, I confirmed with a gentle man whether I was going to the North Station. I looked at the stop sign carefully, worried that I would miss it. But when I got to the North Railway Station, things became complicated. There were many trains, RER lines and subway lines. I couldn&#39;t find the B line at once. I followed the signs but ended up in the wrong place. Fortunately, I asked before getting on the train. You didn&#39;t get on the wrong bus. I was walking around like a headless fly when I saw an officer on duty who was on the phone. I rushed over and asked him where to sit at Charles de Gaulle Airport. He must have been shocked by the fact that I was sweating profusely. While he was talking on the phone, he quickly led me to the car. Coincidentally, the car I was going to take arrived at this time, so I might have a better chance of catching the plane. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then there were forty anxious minutes. Each stop seemed extremely long, and people got on and off the bus leisurely at each stop. I thought that only flash floods, earthquakes, terrorist attacks, and subway failures could prevent me from going to the airport at this time. I was very anxious and kept looking at my phone and looking at the two women sitting next to me who looked calm. They also had huge luggage, but they must have more time. I sighed that I was still sitting on a deck chair by the river yesterday afternoon, eating raw ham and cheese, drinking beer, and today I was about to go through such a test. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally arrived at Charles de Gaulle Airport, twenty minutes before it closed for boarding passes. I followed the crowd and rushed to the counter. A handsome black man opened his hand and said to me: &quot;Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll make it in time. Just relax.&quot; I handed him my passport, thinking that I must look very good. It&#39;s so embarrassing, it&#39;s like a bandit crossing the border. The passengers next to me were also complaining about the heavy traffic jam today, seeming to explain my late arrival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I sent my luggage, queued at the security check, and sent a voice message to my Italian friend about what happened today. The girl in front of me turned out to be Italian, so she said to me: &quot;You should be in front of me. If it were me, I would be extremely anxious.&quot; We are truly sisters from all over the world. She said that she had worked at L&#39;Oréal Paris for three years and was now going to Shanghai to stay for three years. Her plane was behind me. I thanked her and moved in front of her without any ceremony. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I arrived at the boarding gate, I found that the sweat on my body had turned cold, my T-shirt was completely soaked, and the yellow fish pattern printed on it had turned brown. I suddenly felt very worried. I saw a retail store next to me, so I spent twenty euros on a souvenir T-shirt for my trip. I went to the bathroom to put it on and dried my hair to make sure everything was safe. At this time, there is no longer any queue at the boarding gate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I&#39;m in line to board the plane.&quot; I called Mike to reassure him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I just came home too.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Thank you for the airport light rail ticket today, thank you.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;You&#39;re welcome, I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t You delivered it. I&#39;m eating the fish fillet rice bowl you forgot on the seat. It&#39;s not bad.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I wish you a good appetite.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I wish you a safe journey. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, I walked out of Chongqing Airport wearing a slightly tacky T-shirt with a huge Eiffel Tower printed on the chest, like a tourist who had just checked in. I have to say that catching the plane this time has given me a lot of confidence to face the future while feeling lucky. I remembered a scripture: There is a time for everything, a time for everything under the heaven...A time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to abandon; a time to tear, and a time to mend; a time to be silent, and a time to speak...I feel that everything is There is a certainty that sometimes you miss your flight and sometimes you catch up: when necessary, turn on the &quot;assassin mode&quot;, stay vigilant&lt;strong>;and&lt;/strong>; move forward bravely, and there is always a chance of catching up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 21:25:12 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[导游变身导买，这样的旅游团还能走多远？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256920]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, I signed up for two tour groups, namely Three Gorges and Wulong. The orders were placed on the same travel platform. The customer service is very patient, the procedures are very standardized, and electronic contracts, travel notices, insurance purchases, etc. are all available. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scenery on both sides of the Three Gorges is beautiful. On the cruise ship, you can watch the rising sun in the morning and the bright moon and stars in the evening. You can hold a sleeve of breeze and watch the river flowing eastward. It is really a good place to express your love for the mountains and rivers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The gap between the Tiankeng and the ground in Wulong is even more amazing. The Tiankeng is really as if God accidentally dropped a huge boulder, creating a huge crater on the ground. It is majestic, strange, dangerous and... It&#39;s quiet; the crack in the ground is like a narrow crack in the depths of the earth. The rock walls on both sides are steep, with springs and waterfalls splashing above, and streams flowing below. It&#39;s endlessly ethereal and breathtaking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the beauty of these two journeys only ends here, because traveling also requires eating, sleeping, and a tour guide, which does not feel so wonderful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let’s talk about the tour guide first. Tour guides have long implemented the local accompanying system. They change tour guides at each place. When they arrive at the scenic spot, they change to another commentator. Along the way, there are many tour guides. One face is not familiar yet, and another face is changed immediately. It’s a revolving door. Similar. This is very unfriendly to me who is face blind, but that&#39;s it - there&#39;s nothing I can do about it - after not traveling far for three years, I was surprised to find that the guide system has always been the same, but now the tour guide&#39;s style has changed again , have turned into guides and bought. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After we swam at the Three Gorges Dam, on the way to the dock, the tour guide started selling beef, small fish products and sesame food in the car. She said that the quality of these products was guaranteed and the prices were reasonable. She wanted to buy them. Earn money for interest classes for my daughter. The driver cooperated and drove slowly, and then simply stopped on the side of the road. About one-third of the tourists bought the products she put in the car. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the middle of the trip to the Three Gorges, we got on a small boat and traveled to Shennu Creek. In addition to the boatman, there is also a tour guide named Amei on the boat. Shennu Creek is very beautiful, and the guide’s introduction was pretty good at the beginning. However, after only being “good” for a while, she introduced her hometown and various specialties from her hometown, which are “purely natural, pollution-free, and have special effects on the human body.” Efficacy&quot;. As I expected, on the return trip, she started selling the local specialties that had been placed on the cruise ship. During the entire return journey, I heard the tour guide shouting in the headset: &quot;Please support our hometown.&quot; &quot;How many packs do you want?&quot; The mood of watching the scenery was ruined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After arriving in Chongqing, the tour guide did not help me buy any real items. What she sold was a night tour in Chongqing, three places, 70 yuan. When the car arrived in the city, she got off the bus with the tourists participating in the night tour and asked us to go to the hotel to check in. Then the tourists got into a quarrel at the hotel front desk over who checked in first and who last. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wulong Tour also took us to a Miao Village Scenic Spot. In this scenic spot, the most impressive thing was that the tour guide of the scenic spot constantly promoted their silver products. In his mouth, these silver products are unparalleled in the world. The only thing left is that it has a full range of health care effects, blah blah blah. As a result, no one bought it, so he ignored us. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let’s talk about food. Most of the two tour groups include meals. Except for the three meals on the cruise ship, which are normal, the rest is hard to describe. The meal price is 40 yuan per person, eight dishes and one soup. These eight dishes include meaty ones such as very fatty pork belly, stir-fried chicken offal with onions, etc., and vegetarian ones such as cold skin, potatoes, pumpkins, etc. The soup is a veritable soup. I only saw three pieces of radish in one radish soup... &lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;As for the accommodation, each person is only guaranteed to have a bed to sleep on. As for whether the lights are on, whether the bath water is at a suitable temperature, and whether the door lock is broken, tourists are left to their own devices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When traveling, you don’t make a guide, don’t plan a route, don’t bother to think about the car, meals, hotel, etc., but leave it all to the travel agency and become a hands-off shopkeeper yourself. I think it’s very strange. Economical and convenient model. Your travel agency makes money, and I, the tourist, enjoy the beautiful mountains, rivers and good mood. Both parties get what they want, how wonderful! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But what I wonder is, why is the tourism industry running in the opposite direction? You see, the tour guide will almost reach into your pocket and take out the money. The group meal costing 400 yuan per table can be reduced to 40 yuan. The cheaper the room, the better, no matter what facilities it has. Don’t they think they are seeking a dead end and pushing tourists away? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three years after the epidemic, the market demand for tourism is huge. If the tourism industry seizes this trend, rectifies its business practices, provides high-quality services, changes its image, and builds reputation, it should be able to attract many tourists. under their command. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What a pity, they are going further and further on the road of deceiving tourists. I don’t know how far this kind of tour group can go. At least, I don’t dare to join the tour group again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a retired teacher in Jiaxing, Zhejiang)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>; •&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The &quot;hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of Southern Weekend App is looking forward to your contributions.

The reporter learned from the China Bicycle Association on the 17th that my country, as the world&#39;s largest bicycle manufacturer and exporter, currently has more than 200 million bicycles in society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guo Wenyu, vice chairman and secretary-general of the China Cycling Association, said that based on a survey of travel data in eight cities including Beijing, Changsha, and Chengdu, about 30 out of every 100 trips taken by urban residents across the country are made by bicycles. &quot;Two-wheel travel&quot; has been completed, and &quot;two-wheel travel&quot; occurring around rail stations across the country accounts for more than 20% of the total travel volume. &quot;Two-wheel travel&quot; reduces carbon emissions by about 10,000 tons across the country every day. Based on a fuel consumption of 8 liters per 100 kilometers, this is equivalent to saving about 6.6 million liters of gasoline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bicycle industry continues to promote product structure optimization. Guo Wenyu said that the current output of lightweight and intelligent electric-assisted bicycles has increased significantly. In the past two years, the domestic sales growth rate of electric-assisted bicycles has exceeded 20%, and electric-assisted bicycles with intelligent functions are favored by young consumers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bicycle industry continues to advance digitally and intelligently. Guo Wenyu said that currently on the production side, welding robots, painting robots, assembly line feeding robots, etc. have a wider range of applications, and more than 20% of industry companies have carried out production line automation upgrades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the consumer side of the bicycle industry, relying on technical support such as big data and the Internet of Things, new products and new models such as shared bicycles and centralized charging and swapping have emerged. Chu Yiqun, vice president of Haro Group, said that as a leading company in shared travel, Haro&#39;s number of registered users and orders have increased steadily in the past few years. &quot;Using high-level cycling products and services to continue to popularize low-carbon travel and healthy living, shared bicycle companies have a duty-free responsibility.&quot; Chu Yiqun said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 19:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[学者谈县域教育：要给没有能力进城的学生一定的教育发展空间]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256753]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/15/b7Le3Gk6KsMQUogjkOpyho34RgSaUA8lBPeNQWX2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/b7Le3Gk6KsMQUogjkOpyho34RgSaUA8lBP eNQWX2. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250887&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On March 2, 2021, in a rural primary school in Tengchong, Baoshan, Yunnan, preparations Sleeping students. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2017, Lei Wanghong, who was still studying for a doctorate in administration at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, was working on Looking for a topic for her doctoral thesis, she set her sights on grassroots education for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This decision came from a &quot;shock&quot;. She graduated from a rural school in Jianghan Plain and studied all the way to get a doctorate. However, when she returned to her hometown, she heard that the school was no longer what it used to be. Students were fighting and the enrollment rate was declining. The junior high school teacher was beaten by a student and wiped in the back of the classroom. tears. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, Lei Wanghong visited county schools in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Gansu, Henan and other regions, and she found that this phenomenon was not a special case. She noticed that some drastic changes were taking place at the end of basic education, and these changes at the end were silent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the wave of urbanization in education, rural students are pouring into counties, and what is left in villages and towns are often children who cannot afford to go to cities to study. Some of them do not like to study, are disobedient to discipline, and are almost self-indulgent. Giving up, the teacher also has a headache, and both parties are in confusion with no way out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lei Wanghong believes that for county-level governments, the main goal of education urbanization is regional development, that is, by attracting rural students to study in cities and driving rural people to buy houses and consume in cities, thereby promoting land The closed fiscal cycle ultimately promotes regional economic development. However, from a practical point of view, the introduction of education into cities has not greatly stimulated local economic development as expected, but has resulted in some students being left behind in villages and towns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She found that counties in central and western provinces and eastern provinces have different development paths in the process of promoting urbanization of education: public and private education are more balanced in the eastern region, while private education in the central and western regions is relatively stronger. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why are there such regional differences? Educational urbanization has experienced at least ten years of development. How effective is it? Under this wave, what should the remaining children do? Lei Wanghong is now a lecturer at the School of Public Administration of Central South University. She was interviewed by Southern Weekend reporters on related issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The economic foundation determines the development path of county education&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How did you pay attention to county education issues at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>; Once when I returned to my hometown, a neighbor kid told me that my junior high school teacher was beaten by a student and was wiping tears behind the classroom. When I was studying, she was very majestic, and I respected her very much. This contrast was shocking. In addition, the situation in my hometown has not been very good for higher education in recent years, and there has been a fierce discussion in society about the uneven distribution of educational resources. At that time, our team had been studying grassroots governance, and no one had studied grassroots education issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After May 2017, I went to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi and Guizhou and other places to investigate different villages, townships and counties. The education situation of various school stages in the space, and understanding the development of government education, students&#39; family situations, and school social evaluation, the overall research perspective of county education gradually emerged. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Eastern and central and western regions, in county education What problems do each face during development? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The eastern region has sufficient educational resources and capable parents. They generally form better home-school cooperation with schools, but competition in education It is very fierce. For example, the Hangzhou Family Committee election was reported in the news before. In order to give their children more performance opportunities, parents will engage in fierce PK. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most important problem in the central and western regions is intergenerational separation. Parents will also follow the trend and adopt some self-help behaviors, such as &quot;accompanying students&quot;. The phenomenon of accompanying students in Gansu, Shaanxi, Anhui, and Hubei is very universal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Have you found any similarities in the education situation in different regions? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;One similarity is the urbanization of education. To put it simply, the improvement of the quality of schools in the city will attract students to study in the city, which in turn will encourage more families to buy houses in the city, thereby revitalizing land finance and regional development. But there are some differences between the eastern region and the central and western regions. The former&#39;s education urbanization is more of a natural urbanization. Parents move to cities to work, live and take their children to receive education because there are job opportunities in the city. The latter&#39;s education urbanization is driven by local governments, because rural areas The supply of school education is too poor, and local governments have invested more resources in urban schools, thus forcing people to send their children to urban schools. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, I went to a developed county in Zhejiang for research. Basically, all the local village primary schools were withdrawn and concentrated on running schools in towns and villages. Township schools are well-equipped and beautifully built, and their teachers are of high standard, many of whom are admitted from other places. However, due to the urbanization of education, rural children have gone to cities to study, and those who are left behind are children with poor family conditions who do not like to study and are not easy to manage, which is a headache for teachers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later I found that this phenomenon is very common. The end of the eastern region is at the township level, and the end of the central and western regions is at the village level. Being at such an end, unable to provide students with enough educational hope, teachers are also in pain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The development logic of education urbanization in the eastern and central and western regions is the same ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Due to different economic bases, the eastern region and the central and western regions have very different spatial distribution. The eastern region has a developed economy and strong education supply capacity, and the quality of public education in various urban and rural areas of the county can be guaranteed. The eastern region has developed industries and large employment opportunities. Parents go to the cities to find jobs, and their children also go to the cities to study. Families can buy houses and live in the cities. Its urbanization is a natural urbanization in which education and production are synchronized. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A large number of counties in the central and western regions have not yet established local finances that allow local governments to obtain sufficient financial resources. They are unable to ensure the balanced development of urban and rural education and provide employment for local migrant workers returning home. There is also very little space. Young people from peasant families can only go to the eastern cities to work and earn money. Because they cannot afford the high cost of education in developed areas, the children can only stay in their hometowns to go to school and be taken care of by their parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/8QOQd9HsiUr95IHAq4YeB54ACIHt10KrQATDgpbG.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1706&quot; height= &quot;1278&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/8QOQd9HsiUr95IHAq4YeB54ACIHt10KrQATDgpbG.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250888&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In May 2023, Lei Wanghong and his team conducted research in a certain county. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Interviewee/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Public education needs to respond to social needs&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Since at least ten years ago, there have been many views that urbanization of education is a &quot;green engine&quot;. You What is the entry point for research on educational urbanization? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;At that time, I was mainly stimulated by two things. First, many people in the academic community regard urbanization of education as a positive behavior. However, during the actual research process, I found that there are many problems in urbanization of education. Everyone’s educational anxiety is very serious, and many families bear an excessive educational burden. Education, medical care, and housing have become the new &quot;three mountains.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The other thing is that I was deeply inspired after reading the doctoral thesis &quot;Children of Urbanization&quot; by Professor Xiong Yihan of Fudan University. The phenomenon we are concerned about is very similar - can rural children share the blue sky of education with urban children after entering the city? In fact, rural children are easily marginalized when they move to cities. For example, teachers in the city will mention that rural children have stereotypes such as being unhygienic and unruly. The campus culture of urban schools will make rural children feel inferior to a certain extent; rural children rarely have access to class power. structure, because teachers are more likely to accept children who are influenced by urban culture and form effective communication and interaction with them. When I held discussions with urban and rural students, I also found that urban students have stronger expressive skills and are good at showing themselves, while rural students are introverted. When they want to speak, they will inadvertently look at urban students for fear of saying something wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;To promote the urbanization of education, local governments must build new schools in counties and open Between public and private schools, which option do most counties prefer? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The government is more willing to build public schools. Because private schools have difficulties in management, they can charge fees independently, use enrollment policies flexibly, and attract high-quality students through benefits. After the results of the high school and high school entrance exams are released, these students become the &quot;living signs&quot; of the school&#39;s publicity. Teachers will further gather in private schools, putting local public schools in a weak position and affecting the local education ecology to a certain extent. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;But in fact, the central and western regions will still choose to introduce it Private school, why? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Because the local finances of some counties in the central and western regions are not enough to support the development of public education. On the one hand, the local government has the task of attracting investment, and on the other hand, it has to ensure the supply of education and is under multiple pressures. Private schools in some areas are introduced through investment promotion. The local government has not only completed the corresponding investment quotas, but also alleviated the pressure on local degree supply. At the same time, the outstanding students cultivated by private schools can also be counted as the educational achievements of local governments. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why do parents prefer private schools? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The main reason is that many public schools have not responded to parents’ educational demands. This year I went to a township junior high school in a central province for research and found that the student cafeteria was not equipped with tables and chairs, and students squatted at the top of the stairs to eat.还有学校安排学生住在二三十年前的房子里，宿舍的墙皮不时会脱落。 2021年我在调研时遇到一个司机，他说两个小孩都在私立学校读书，一年要花6万块，夫妻二人的工资只够小孩的开销，生活压力很大。我问他如果公立学校能够提供相对较好的食宿服务，但每学期需要多交一千块钱，愿不愿意去？他说肯定愿意。这也是大多数家长的心声，只有政府想办法真正回应老百姓的诉求，学生才会慢慢从私立学校里回流。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;经过研究，你发现教育城镇化可能带来哪些问题？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;雷望红：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;一是负债风险，一些地方政府以教育为抓手，推进教育兴城，短时间内投入大量资金新建学校，导致负债严重。最近我听说一个中部省份县城，正在花巨资建一所学校，调研中很多县城都有巨额负债。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;二是学校的维护成本很高，一些地方政府超前按照最高标准建设学校，大量空间闲置，导致学校运营成本非常高。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;三是农民教育负担重。一些地方在建设中小学时，只看重单纯的教育问题，不考虑整体社会分工情况，一些城区新建学校没有配备宿舍、食堂，农村家长将孩子送进城了仍然需要在城里租房或买房陪读，不能照顾孩子的家长就将孩子交给托管机构，比如现在广西的托管机构特别发达，托管机构不仅管学生的生活，还管课后学习。无论是租房或买房陪读，还是托管，都大大增加了农民的教育经济负担。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;四是刚刚提到的农村学生适应问题，城区学校内实质上形成了新的城乡教育二元结构，农村学生的家庭出身和家庭知识能力，不一定能支持他们在城市里接受公平的教育。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;既然有这么多问题，为什么中西部省份的基层还是在推进教育城镇化？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;雷望红：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;把学生集中到县城，除了方便管理以外，县域政府还试图通过教育城镇化来激活当地土地财政。通过大力发展县城教育，让农民进城买房。地方政府能够促进资金回流、人口聚集，形成链条，让县域经济活跃起来。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;这些努力有效果吗？看到你博士论文调查走访的3个中西部县城，最终房价都没有涨上去，这是为什么？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;雷望红：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;实际上农民进城买房的积极性并不高，甘肃一个县城2014年房价是4000元/平方米，但2017年我到该县调研时，房价却还在4000元左右徘徊，即使如此，房子还是卖不出去。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;县域教育的发展关键在于县域经济。农民进城购房积极性不高的根本原因在于，城里缺乏足以支撑他们维持家庭生活的工业基础，农民工在县城如果只能做建筑工、服务员等工作，收入水平不足以支持他们在县城买房定居。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;教育城镇化是一条值得肯定的地方发展路径吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;雷望红：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;教育城镇化是一个必然趋势，只是存在快慢之分。我们批判的是以教育作为抓手，大搞教育兴城的现象。教育城镇化要以合理的速度推进，一方面要尊重自然流动规律，老百姓有能力进城、想进城，要尊重他们的选择；与此同时，也要看到人为因素推动教育城镇化所带来的负债、维护成本高、学生适应难等问题。在目前的阶段更合适的方式是建设好乡镇学校，给没有能力进城的学生一定的教育发展空间，要让在这个空间里读书的孩子有希望考上高中、大学，这样整个社会阶层的流动才能保持畅通，才有希望。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;选调生是组织部门面向高校择优招录的应届毕业生，有定向和非定向之分。招录时对政治面貌、奖学金和学生干部任职经历等有特殊要求。其中，定向选调要求更严，主要面向国内重点高校或者部分高校的重点专业，而非定向选调的最低要求一般也是普通公办本科院校。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但选调的格局正在发生变化。据南方周末记者不完全统计，除上海外，湖南、福建的部分民办高校毕业生也具有报考选调的资格。另外，四川、山西、广东等10个省份，报考范围还扩大到国（境）外高校。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，选调生规模也在扩大，这与各地稳就业政策相关。2023年7月，上海市就业工作领导小组发布的稳就业措施中，就提到逐步扩大选调规模，且要“持续实施面向应届优秀大学毕业生的选调招录工作”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“最主要是不以学校出身来判断英雄。”一位接近上海市委组织部的人士对南方周末记者表示。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;范围扩大，门槛也在提高&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;根据前述上海市委组织部发布的公告，有四类高校的学生可以报名选调：北京大学等44所不限专业高校、中央财经大学等30所限定专业的高校、华东政法大学等29所本市高校以及新增试点院校。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;民办高校被包含在第三类“29所本市高校”之中，共7所，分别为上海杉达学院、上海视觉艺术学院、上海外国语大学贤达经济人文学院、上海建桥学院、上海师范大学天华学院、上海兴伟学院、上海立达学院。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些学校大多由专科院校升格为本科，其中上海立达学院升本时间最晚，直到2018年才开始招收本科生。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;招收民办高校毕业生并非2023年才开始的，南方周末记者发现，这一政策早在2021年就已实行。此前，上海市选调仅招收北京大学、清华大学、中国人民大学等15所高校毕业生，其中市内985、211高校占到9所。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年起，上海放宽对高校的条件限制，将30所本地高校纳入名单，其中就包括了前述7所民办高校。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为补充基层党政领导干部的重要方式，选调生制度在诞生之初就是优中选优。1965年，教育部分配一部分大学毕业生到农村工作，选调生制度自此开始。1970年代末，这项制度陆续在各省开展，选调对象主要为大学中党性较强、成绩优秀的本科毕业生。而为了解决基层干部队伍中缺乏高学历人才的问题，2009年，重庆市首创面向清北等985大学的定向选调制度，拉开向名校定向选调的序幕。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者注意到，目前一些省份公布的定向选调公告中，还会特别注明，招录院校范围不含独立学院、民办高校。但也有省份把选调范围扩大到民办学校，从全国范围来看，福建、湖南部分民办高校的毕业生，也可以报考选调生。福建就曾采用指标分配的方式，将选调名额定点分至仰恩大学等省内民办高校。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;范围扩大，报考门槛也在提高。以上海为例，并非名单中高校的所有毕业生都有报考资格，除了年龄、学习成绩要求外，还需至少满足一项“其他条件”，包括中共党员（含预备党员）、担任一年以上的校院系团委书记等相关职务、获得优秀或三好学生荣誉称号或奖学金。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于前述包括民办学校的第三类本市高校而言，则需要同时满足获得国家奖学金或上海市奖学金，以及担任一年以上的校院系团委书记等相关职务的条件。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而湖南省2023年的选调生考试中，不再区分普通、定向选调，也不再限定“双一流”与非“双一流”学校毕业生可报考的岗位，但考生均需满足（预备）党员和学生干部任职的要求。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;境外高校纳入选调范围&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;值得注意的是，此次上海选调，在第四类试点高校中首次纳入了世界排名前50的海外高校毕业生，由市委组织部单独划定分数线。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据南方周末记者统计，截至2023年9月，明确表示招收国（境）外高校毕业生的省份共有10个。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大部分省份界定的学校范围，是以QS世界大学排名前100位为准，并要求考生具有硕士及博士以上学历。有的省份对本科学历有所限制，如河北省需要考生取得纳入选调范围的国内本科高校学位。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于留学生是否为中共党员，或者是否获得奖学金，各地规定有异。如广东、山西未作强制要求，仅在公告中注明满足要求者优先选调，北京则需留学生具有下述三个条件之一：中共（预备）党员、三好学生等荣誉称号（最高学历期间获得）、具有参军入伍经历。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就组织部门的工作难度而言，将国（境）外高校毕业生纳入选调范围或难度更大。2022年12月，有网友在人民网领导留言板上留言，建议福建将国外学校优秀毕业生纳入选调生考试中。福建省委组织部回复称，“因无法到学校对考察人选进行实地深入考察并作出考察结论，所以一直未将境外高校纳入选调范围。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于选调国（境）外高校毕业生，四川招收数量较多，该省也是第一个吃螃蟹的省份。早在2015年，该省就针对国（境）外高校毕业生单独出台相关政策，首批共录用24名国（境）外高校毕业生，其中有5名博士。2023年，在四川的定向选调生中，国（境）外高校毕业生人数达到82人，比2015年翻了3倍。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据南方周末记者不完全统计，四川2015年首批录用的24名国（境）外高校毕业生中，目前有4位已达正科。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“一年只有一两个”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;选调生的范围为何在不断扩大？“之所以纳入民办高校，除了对本市高校倾向照顾以外，最主要是不以学校出身来判断英雄。”一位接近上海市委组织部的人士告诉南方周末记者，择优审核时会将高校上报的考生分配到负责的干部手中，按照学生的基本条件如所获奖项等指标进行加权考核，“与学校不挂钩”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实上，早在2018年5月21日，中共中央组织部召开新时代激励干部新担当新作为暨加强改进选调生工作座谈会，就提到“突出政治标准，适当扩大规模，分级分类精准选调”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但各地扩大选调生范围也有稳就业的考量。在前述2023年7月上海市就业工作领导小组发布的《关于优化调整稳就业政策全力促发展惠民生的若干措施》中，就提出要“逐步扩大选调规模”。而2023年重庆公布的非定向选调人数达到600人，较前一年400人而言，扩招50%。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;范围扩大之后，是否有更多的民办高校毕业生进入选调序列？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上海建桥学院、上海杉达学院就业处工作人员均对南方周末记者表示“近年没有考上上海选调生的”。而上海外国语大学贤达人文经济学院工作人员则透露，“一年只有一两个”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上海杉达学院的工作人员认为，虽然可以考，但“的确很难，奖学金、班干部（等要求）都要达到”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前述接近上海市委组织部的人士表示，在考试过程中，名校生整体的表达能力要优于一般民办高校，“最终录取结果处于正态分布，清北、人大毕业生多一些，其他高校少一点”。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;证监会网站9月15日通报，持有我乐家居7.11%股权的大股东于范易及其一致行动人违规减持我乐家居股票，拟依法没收于范易及其一致行动人违法所得1653万元，并从严处以3295万元罚款，合计罚没4948万元。根据通报，于范易及其一致行动人在2021年通过二级市场买入我乐家居股票达到5%时就没有依法履行信息披露义务，被警示。而这次，于范易等在2023年9月5日、6日两天将其持有的7.11%股票全部减持，再次违反了持股比例变化达到5%时应公告并在3日内不得再买卖该股票的规定。对此，证监会决定予以重罚。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;证券法对持有（包括通过一致行动人共同持有）上市公司5%以上股份的股东买卖股票作了不少特别规定：持股达到5%时，应在3日内向证监会、交易所书面报告，并通知上市公司予以公告，在此期间不得再次买卖该上市公司股票；此后每增减5%时，也要进行报告和公告，并在公告后3日内不得再买卖该公司股票；持股达到5%后，每增减1%时，应该在次日通知上市公司予以公告。作出这些规定，是因为持股5%以上的股东被认为是重要股东，其买卖股票行为可能对公司股价产生重要影响，影响其他小股东的权益，因此需要及时公开。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;股票市场设立的目的，是为了让上市公司获得业务发展所需要的资金，同时给投资者提供分享公司未来收益的机会。上市公司为投资者创造价值，通常有两种途径，一是股价上涨，二是现金分红。但A股有不少上市公司股价已经跌破发行价（破发），也就是说上市至今股价不仅没有涨，反而跌了，虽然不排除中间涨跌过程中有部分投资者是有收益的，但总体来看，投资者是亏了。据界面新闻统计，截至2023年9月6日收盘，A股有758家上市公司破发，在5000多家上市公司中占比不算少。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;再来看分红。根据中国上市公司协会的数据，自资本市场成立以来，全部上市公司累计现金分红总额不足16万亿元，而包括首发和再融资在内，股权融资总额达到18万亿。现金分红总额还没有融资总额多，也就是说，总体来看，中国股市投资者还在给上市公司输血，而没有得到足够的回报。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就是在这样的投资环境中，上市公司的控股股东、实控人等屡屡通过减持公司股票大额套现，割中小股东韭菜，几成A股顽疾，备受投资者诟病。不少A股公司上市目的就是圈钱，大股东、实控人从来没有想过为投资者创造价值。一些公司，在上市之初就通过财务造假等手段通过上市审核、抬高发行价格，上市之后，又抓住一切机会变现，或者通过减持，或者通过抵押股票贷款，有的则通过再融资再次从股市圈钱。正是因此（当然还因为长期存在的信息披露违规、操纵股价等违法现象），A股市场被一些投资者称为“韭菜收割机”“投机市场”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;股市的这些不合理现象，严重侵害了投资者尤其是中小投资者的利益，也破坏了投资者的信心。而近来A股市场走势一路向下，与投资者缺乏信心有着密切的关系。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了整治大股东侵害中小股东利益的问题，证监会日前颁布《进一步规范股份减持行为》新规，要求上市公司存在破发、破净情形，或者最近三年未进行现金分红、累计现金分红金额低于最近三年年均净利润30%的，控股股东、实际控制人不得通过二级市场减持本公司股份。也就是说，如果上市公司没有为二级市场投资者创造足够的价值，其控股股东、实控人等不得通过减持来变现。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;新规的初衷是好的，关键是能否执行。所以，这次当我乐家居、东方时尚等上市公司股东违规减持发生后，股民都在等着看监管部门如何处罚。如果还是像以前那样轻描淡写地由交易所进行“谴责”“警示”，而没有实质性处罚，那新规显然不会有太多威慑力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;好在，从最近公布的处理进展来看，这次监管部门显然是动真格的了：我乐家居大股东被没收违规减持的收益并处巨额罚款，基本上吐出了因减持而得到的全部收益（包括合法减持部分的收益）；而东方时尚的董事长更是因为被发现还有其他操纵股价的行为，要被追究刑事责任。雷厉风行地执法，对于提振市场信心无疑具有重要的意义。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，限制上市公司大股东、实控人减持，只是堵住了他们变现的一个途径。要让资本市场真正成为投资者和上市公司双赢的市场，避免上市成为大股东、实控人割韭菜的途径，还需要更多措施，让大股东、实控人更难从股市圈钱、变现。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比如，2023年2月交易所出台的新规，允许限售股通过转融通渠道出借。有观点认为，这让战略投资者可能通过该机制变相减持，可能存在公平性以及制度一致性等问题。最近刚刚上市的金帝股份，上市首日就融券卖出（相当于做空）450多万股，金额高达2.2亿元，而这些券，疑似来自公司高管、核心员工等“战略投资者”所持有的限售股。此前也有公司上市首日“战略投资者”大笔出借限售股融券卖出的情况。这是否涉及上市公司高管上市首日“卖空”自家股票锁定收益，是否会侵害二级市场投资者利益，值得关切。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;经查，为配合“网红”在直播间的虚假宣传，MCN机构找河北保定某传媒公司、北京徐某等网络水军团伙开展“投流”业务。该传媒公司使用1000余个营业执照，在短视频平台注册广告账户，以100元至160元增加1千个关注粉丝的价格，在直播间为网红涨粉。徐某通过专业平台接单，下发至各地“机房”批量操控机器人账号，伪装成消费者,在直播带货期间评论商品产地、夸大产品功效，让网红主播在短时间内贴上助农、公益等标签。通过“投流”平台，MCN机构将网红精准推送给相关兴趣爱好、适宜年龄段、特定区域的网民，以达到涨粉、引流的目的，制造爆款、抢单的假象，诱导消费者购买产品。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;该网络水军团伙主要有以下几个特点：&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;01&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;组织严密&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;通过实地走访当地群众、调取网络信息、摸排直播团伙等方式深入侦查，发现网红主播前端表演，水军团伙幕后引流，形成了“吸粉-引流-带货-变现”的产业化运作模式。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;02&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;迷惑性强&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;MCN机构专门搜集经典剧本，通过专业摆拍，雇佣网络水军烘托气氛，呈现在网友眼前的是网红艰辛的生活和带货致富的“励志”故事，以此获取流量，消费广大网友的善意，继而制假售假逐利，致使网友真假难辨。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;03&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;涉案地广&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;网络水军团伙分布于全国各地，涉及凉山、成都、南京、广州等多地，各团伙以网络通讯工具为链接桥梁，相互之间不知晓真实身份，各自独立运作，去中心化特点明显。涉案网红直播销售的假冒“特色农产品”总额达2000余万元，商品发往全国各地，严重侵犯网络市场经济秩序和消费者合法权益。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;截至目前，凉山网安部门共摧毁“网络水军”公司3个，抓获犯罪嫌疑人52人，其中网红主播2人，MCN机构成员2人，供应链负责人2人。打掉虚假宣传网络传媒公司5个，电商平台供应店铺12个，查封涉案公司13家，捣毁直播平台刷量控评“机房”4个，查扣涉案手机400余部，封停涉案虚拟账号1500余个，冻结涉案资金500余万元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[寻鳄8天8夜]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256918]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 15:12:13&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[50万浣熊“入侵”欧洲，“生态害兽”泛滥难解]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256912]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 14:01:31&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/SkMGCHEwDIHSiYtOQxnfeARWyJpxmNKlGd47Pcct.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;浣熊原产自北美，因常在水边作出清洗动作而得名“浣熊”。然而，当它们来到欧洲大陆，却登上了外来入侵物种的“黑名单”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;早在2020年1月，德语日报《Grenz Echo》就报道称比利时东部浣熊泛滥，将其称为“浣熊瘟疫”。2023年9月，比利时当局再次披露称“5万只浣熊已在该国南部山区安家”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当第一只北美浣熊踏上欧洲大陆时，商人们盘算着有利可图的皮毛生意。九十多年后，浣熊种群在森林、城市里泛滥成灾，生物入侵问题迫在眉睫。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了控制浣熊扩散，欧洲部分地区默许或鼓励猎杀浣熊。不过，动物保护组织却称其为“大屠杀”，谴责“猎人们试图用所谓的物种保护口号和站不住脚的狩猎论据为大屠杀辩护”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中国生物多样性保护与绿色发展基金会副秘书长王豁告诉南方周末记者，在世界各地，当某个外来入侵物种（IAS）造成了非常严重的生态问题时，直接猎杀成为不得已的治理方式之一。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“不过，这些措施通常需要谨慎规划和执行，以确保其有效性，并把不良影响最小化。”王豁说。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;浣熊“瘟疫”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;据比利时媒体9月4日报道，比利时正在同“入侵”的浣熊作斗争。当局承认，5万多只浣熊已经在比利时被森林覆盖的南部山区安家，采取捕杀方式消灭他们为时已晚。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比利时瓦隆的环境部门官员塞利娜·泰利耶（Céline Tellier）在受访时说：“这种动物看起来很可爱。不幸的是，在世界各地，入侵的外来物种是造成生物多样性退化的五大因素之一。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“这是史无前例的，非常壮观的一次入侵。”埃里克·阿尔克马德（Eric Alkemade）是比利时列日市的一名职业猎人，他告诉南方周末记者，自侵入危机出现以来，他每天都会接到很多关于浣熊的电话。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在客户委托下，他每个月捕捉9-15只浣熊。得益于当地浣熊业务的激增，他的收入明显增加。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“在人们的想象中，浣熊是可爱的小伙伴。但事实上，如果它们得不到满足，就会具有很强攻击性。”埃里克说，浣熊爪子锋利，会狠狠地抓咬。当它们无法在阳台上找到食物，就可能潜入人类房屋。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“浣熊造成的破坏不言而喻。”埃里克说，浣熊会破坏包括黑鹳在内的各种鸟类的巢穴。此外，浣熊还会攻击人类的家禽与宠物，比如“鸡、兔子、鸭子”等。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果浣熊数量有限，或许人类可以和这些“麻烦制造者”保持适当的距离。不幸的是，浣熊种群却日渐壮大。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“近年来，欧洲大陆浣熊数量估计超过50万只。除了比利时之外，在欧洲许多国家，这种动物也都成为令当局头疼的外来入侵物种。”王豁向南方周末记者表示，自2016年起，浣熊就被列入《欧盟关切的外来入侵物种名录》。这意味着在整个欧洲联盟范围内，不允许关于浣熊的进口、繁殖、运输、商业化或有意把它们释放到自然环境中。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;小小的浣熊为什么会让欧盟“为之色变”？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“浣熊是杂食性动物，鸟类、昆虫、水生生物和植物等都是它的食物。种群泛滥不仅会和本土动物形成食物竞争，也会直接威胁到当地生物多样性。”王豁表示，浣熊会破坏栖息地，尤其是在寻找食物时，它们可能挖掘地洞或破坏树木。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，浣熊携带包括狂犬病在内的诸多病毒，对当地野生动物和家畜造成威胁。浣熊有时会在垃圾桶里觅食，引发垃圾管理和卫生问题等。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“生存高手”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;北美浣熊引入欧洲，源自于两次人为的物种迁徙。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据公开报道，上世纪30年代，德国纳粹统治时期，浣熊被引入德国，用于狩猎及获取皮毛。上世纪60年代，由于美国空军人员释放了许多作为吉祥物带到法国的动物，它们在法国埃纳地区一个空军基地周围安家落户。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王豁向南方周末记者补充了诸多细节。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在上世纪30年代，浣熊毛时装一度流行，德国许多养殖场饲养浣熊。不过，圈养的浣熊不如野生的皮质好，于是一些母浣熊就被野放到德国西部的森林中，十年间建立了稳定的种群，并扩充到德国东部。1945年，由于战争空袭，又有不少养殖的浣熊逃跑、野化。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比利时地处德国和法国之间，自然成为不少浣熊的迁徙目的地。在新家园，浣熊种群迎来快速增长期，展现出极强的适应能力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王豁向南方周末记者介绍，“在野外，浣熊在陆地、水下、树上，几乎在任何地方都能找到补充营养的食物。在城镇里，浣熊可以通过翻垃圾、攀爬进入人类房屋院落等觅食。再加上浣熊外形可爱，人类对它们通常不抱有敌意。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;繁殖策略上，浣熊常选择树洞、地洞或山洞作为产仔地点，这些地方提供了相对安全和隐蔽的环境，有助于幼崽的存活。另外，浣熊的哺乳期不长。浣熊幼崽在同一年的夏季末就可以断奶，然后开始独立生活。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;广西南宁动物园动物饲养员柳先生告诉南方周末记者，相较于其他哺乳动物，浣熊繁殖能力较强。比如猴子一年生一个幼崽，平均3-4岁开始繁殖。而浣熊一年能生4个左右，而且性成熟早。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同时，浣熊在生存上也有诸多优势。“在自然界中，浣熊能游泳，会挖洞，善攀爬，在树上、地上都能生存。在城市中，垃圾是浣熊最容易获得食物的途径。然而，同样是依靠人类垃圾生存，浣熊却比老鼠个头大、天敌少，甚至和人类宠物猫、狗打斗，优势明显。”柳先生说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;浣熊在欧洲的泛滥失控，跟能控制它们的野生动物（如鹰隼等猛禽、狼、狐狸等）的稀缺或许也有一些关系。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王豁提出，猫头鹰是一种常见的小型猛禽，但对于浣熊的幼崽的威胁就是致命的。在欧洲的自然界中，如果附近有猛禽盘旋，就会逼着哺乳期的母浣熊不得不叼着幼崽转移、另觅安全的巢穴。在健康的自然生态系统中，相当一部分的幼崽会在头6个月死掉，只有一部分能存活下来。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;埃里克告诉南方周末记者，一些比利时居民希望通过浣熊的天敌——比如狐狸和狼，用天然的食物链来保持生态的平衡。但这“为时已晚”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;埃里克说，为了达到控制浣熊数量的效果，狼群必须要在某些地区长久定居。与此同时，浣熊的快速繁殖造成了猎物与捕食者之间的不平衡。“这场战争已经不平等了。如果不采取严厉措施，就很难遏制它们的快速增长。”埃里克说。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“猎杀”争议&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;近年来，猎杀成为控制浣熊暴增的常见方式之一。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据德国狩猎协会（DJV）披露数据，在2020-2021狩猎季，德国猎人合法捕获了200163只浣熊，二十年间增长了57倍。该协会还披露，自20世纪90年代以来，浣熊遭猎杀数量持续上升。这表明“入侵物种已在空间上大范围扩散”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为控制浣熊泛滥，甚至有组织为清除浣熊支付专门费用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比利时猎人埃里克向南方周末记者介绍，他一般接受私营部门或者地方市政部门的委托进行猎捕，按月支付报酬，通常是1500欧元/人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;埃里克透露，当地政府曾利用水利和林业官员来消灭浣熊，但“他们人数太少，装备也不好”。而埃里克持有狩猎执照，有专业的狩猎技能。“我每天都会去看我设置的陷阱，我有武器执照，经验丰富，装备精良。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，埃里克的工作并没有得到所有人认可。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“很多天真的人保护和喂养浣熊，认为我是野蛮人。”埃里克说，盛行的动物保护思潮让人们对猎杀浣熊变得敏感，但他觉得自己的工作是为了公众利益，是为了防止人畜共患病的传播。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同时，猎杀措施也遭到一些动物保护组织的反对。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;德国善待动物组织（PETA-Team）就曾呼吁，“停止不必要的浣熊狩猎”。该协会提出了保护浣熊的五个理由，其中包括猎杀浣熊会适得其反，因为“浣熊可能通过增加繁殖来应对狩猎”，以及浣熊不会对当地生物多样性构成威胁，因为“濒危物种几乎不属于浣熊的食物”等。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者注意到，该组织于2022年7月发起网上请愿，呼吁欧盟委员会将浣熊从入侵物种名单中删除，截至目前已有7643名支持者。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在浣熊的老家北美，人们对待浣熊的态度也更加宽容。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“A1 raccoon 浣熊博士”小型动物防护公司位于加拿大多伦多，该公司的主要业务领域是帮助客户处理野生动物入侵、害虫防护等问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;该公司员工向南方周末记者介绍，在工作中，他们常遇到浣熊也常常侵入人类的房屋。两个月前，温哥华就发生了浣熊袭击人和宠物狗的事件，“小狗被弄瞎了一只眼睛”。而人类接触浣熊而感染狂犬病毒的情况，也时有发生。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，在公司所服务的范围内，民众对浣熊依旧持有宽容态度。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“法律不允许我们捕杀野生动物，我们只是把一些入侵人类居住地的浣熊驱逐而已。大家对浣熊基本上还是有好感的。”该公司员工向南方周末记者透露。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在美国休斯敦，浣熊常来华人小艾（化名）家的院子里吃“自助餐”，那是小艾专门为浣熊设置的自助喂食箱。院子里还养着鸡和鱼，但“浣熊从没嚯嚯过”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;小艾说，当她过去租住公寓时，常看到浣熊在夜间翻找公用垃圾箱。“不过他们只是翻垃圾，吃完就走。有时丢垃圾的邻居们会遇到浣熊，“大家也大都觉得可爱，没见过有人恐慌和厌恶”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“浣熊不会无缘无故入侵破坏。”在小艾看来，人类侵占野生动物家园，导致浣熊食物匮乏，不得已翻垃圾果腹。她反对捕杀浣熊，主张用绝育方式治理浣熊泛滥问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王豁认为，相较于捕杀，绝育通常被视为一种相对温和、比较人道的方法，用来控制外来入侵物种的数量。但是，这种方法也需要考虑时间、资源和可行性的因素。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“治理入侵物种泛滥成灾是一个复杂的问题，往往需要综合采取多种措施。”王豁认为，应对入侵物种问题需要综合考虑各种因素，包括物种的特性、环境的情况，以及社会和道德的考虑。通常情况下，最佳的做法是采取多种方法的组合，以最大程度地减少对当地生态系统和经济的不利影响。&lt;/p>;
