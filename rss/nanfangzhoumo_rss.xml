The former is &quot;For the Secret Fragrance Comes&quot;, and the latter is &quot;Peace is Like a Dream&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What a coincidence, the main plot of them is &quot;the evil girl decides to be a good person after rebirth&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first life of Hua Qian, the arrogant daughter of Hua Qian, in order to plot against the uncle who does not love her, he designed to frame the second daughter&#39;s family. In the end, not only was she kicked out, but her own family was also destroyed. , repented before his death. After rebirth, she returned to her wedding night. Unfortunately, she had already done all the bad things, so she had no choice but to turn the tide and make amends for her bad deeds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/81b97614dc7a65dbf1268fc6a908e4ba.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/81b97614dc7a65dbf1268fc6a908e4ba.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258137&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Ning&#39;an Queen Jiang Xuening in &quot;Like a Dream&quot; was a selfish person in her first life. She was devoted to the position of queen and planned every step, letting down many people who fell in love with her. When the imperial power fell, she lost all hope and committed suicide. After rebirth, she returned to her teenage years, and she still had time to change her life path. Whenever she had to make a choice, she made a different choice from her previous life, not wanting the tragedy to happen again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/74951bcdfcdb2f12eba8eb9212f5b073.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/74951bcdfcdb2f12eba8eb9212f5b073.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258138&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《Weiyou &quot;Secret Fragrance Comes&quot; and &quot;Ning&#39;an Like a Dream&quot; were respectively adapted from the Zhihu novel &quot;Washing the Leading Flowers&quot; and the Jinjiang novel &quot;Kunning&quot;. The original works were both popular hits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In online novels, &quot;rebirth novels&quot; are a type that attracts a lot of attention. &quot;Harem stories&quot; and &quot;house fighting stories&quot; are only popular periodically, but &quot;rebirth stories&quot; have a long-lasting momentum, and &quot;Rebirth of Me xxxxxx&quot; has become a popular title template. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to attract readers in the first three golden chapters, some authors even put a &quot;rebirth&quot; shell on ordinary costume romance novels, but this setting has little impact on the subsequent plot. &quot;Pseudo-rebirth literature&quot; is not within the scope of our discussion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a term in psychology called &quot;unfinished complex&quot;, which may be used to explain the popularity of rebirth literature. It refers to an individual who, because of something or a situation that has not yet been satisfactorily resolved, especially a trauma, always dwells on it subconsciously, constantly embellishes the unfinished alternative, and then continues to seek compensatory satisfaction in later life. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, another life trajectory in parallel time and space has attracted countless people&#39;s yearning for it. There is no regret medicine in the world, and no one can start over, so it is better to give this hope to the fictional protagonists in the rebirth novel and let them live again with their own memories. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Being able to repeat such a setting is also very popular in the drama market. Looking at the rebirth dramas in the past two years, they are usually divided into two types: dramas in which villains are reincarnated and reformed, and dramas in which good guys are reborn and revenge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rebirth of evildoers is to correct the mistakes in life. This type of drama promotes correct values, highlights the importance of choices, and guides everyone to be kind to others. Just like Andy Lau&#39;s classic line in &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot;, &quot;I didn&#39;t have a choice before, but now I want to be a good person.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The aforementioned &quot;For the Secret Fragrance Comes&quot; and &quot;Ningan is Like a Dream&quot; can both be classified into this category. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first episode of &quot;The Secret Fragrance Comes&quot; is when Hua Qian&#39;s family was sanctioned and she witnessed the death of her parents. She heard a hazy whisper on the edge of life and death: &quot;If I could have my life over again, Opportunity, will you make a change?&quot; &quot;I will&quot; sets the tone of the whole play. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/53329d2a69b1d633f364c8545098effa.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;607&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/53329d2a69b1d633f364c8545098effa.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258140&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src =&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/a38f9135dfd9bc86e14faee19a7de622.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;624&quot; data-src=&quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/a38f9135dfd9bc86e14faee19a7de622.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258141&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Ning&#39;an Like a Dream&quot; has been added based on the original text A deceptive introduction: A modern female writer was writing a book about the demon queen&#39;s execution (this is the first life), and suddenly decided to change the heroine Jiang Xuening&#39;s character (this is the second life), and wrote &quot;This time, Jiang Xuening&quot; , will never enter the palace again.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/c0f57245e9382396f43395d0ca92f7e2.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;597&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/c0f57245e9382396f43395d0ca92f7e2.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258142&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src =&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/11c564e31885728c60dd3d2caa117307.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;597&quot; data-src=&quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/11c564e31885728c60dd3d2caa117307.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258139&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that the lives of Hua Qian and Jiang Xuening are all happy. With the original intention of &quot;doing good&quot;, can you get what you want after being reborn? Is the river of destiny so easy to figure out? The answer is of course no. Along with the &quot;unfinished complex&quot; comes obsession and compulsion. Driven by the mentality of &quot;I have to force myself&quot;, the restarted life may not be perfect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Remorse brings shame and glory, so Hua Qian becomes humble and polite, seriously acts as the uncle&#39;s wife, and strives to have a good relationship with the people around her. In order to make up for the debt owed to the second female lead in her previous life, Hua Qian also tried her best to bring her relationship with the uncle together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/262921949e592c455bd6625ebff7b358.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/262921949e592c455bd6625ebff7b358.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258143&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But she changed , everyone&#39;s attitude has also changed accordingly. In the previous life, no one loved her despite all the institutions, but in this life, her true love cannot withstand the active flattery of all men. The series falls into the cliche emotional line of one woman vs. three men: the wavering uncle, the strategizing head of the family, the loyal and passionate bodyguard, how to choose? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/4e82acbecac76ed8705a53bbcc1f02cc.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height= &quot;683&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/4e82acbecac76ed8705a53bbcc1f02cc.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258144&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other side, Jiang Xuening&#39;s restart of life focuses on avoiding pitfalls. The thunderbolts he stepped on in his previous life are all lessons for his current life. So in the eyes of everyone, this unruly daughter-in-law actually became much smarter in a matter of days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/7505f4c4ef268ac28a56d509fec7f246.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/7505f4c4ef268ac28a56d509fec7f246.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258145&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The male protagonist Xie Wei also began to pay special attention to her. The person who &quot;forced her to commit suicide&quot; in her previous life was destined to suffer another disaster that she could not escape. Coupled with her Bai Yueguang and childhood sweetheart, isn&#39;t this a coincidence? Another emotional line of one woman vs three men. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/ec95baf7e5cab7909e66b14c89e25b23.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;457&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/ec95baf7e5cab7909e66b14c89e25b23.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258147&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Using Sociology Interpreted from the perspective of Zygmunt Bauman, the expression of individualization is the transformation from the &quot;bearer&quot; of the identity to the &quot;responsible person&quot;. Hua Qian and Jiang Xuening were hateful in their previous lives, but they were also the bearers of a tragic fate. In this life, they opened their eyes wide and began to learn to take on their own rights and responsibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the subsequent development of the series still leads to the myth of fatalism. I have heard many truths and learned to be a good person, but I can avoid tragedy A but cannot escape tragedy B. The design of fate can always give people Surprise and shock. TV dramas need such twists and turns to better build dramatic tension, but it also leads to the failure of the audience&#39;s psychological expectations. We actually don&#39;t want to watch a plot that is too sadistic, especially since it is a rebirth drama. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A revenge drama in which a good guy is reborn is actually more in line with the physique of drama fans. A good man who always does good, but falls into the trap of others and steps into the abyss. If he could live again, we would see him kill everyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is why &quot;The Temptation of Going Home&quot; will become a classic. Lin Pinru fell and Gao Shanshan stood up. Although it is not a rebirth drama, the psychological roots are the same. As Bacon said, &quot;Revenge is brutal justice&quot;, and the plot of &quot;an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth&quot; is in line with the audience&#39;s imagination of happy grudges. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Last year&#39;s domestic drama &quot;The Lost Years&quot; and the Korean drama &quot;The Youngest Son of the Chaebol Family&quot; were both revenge dramas in which good guys were reborn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first three episodes of &quot;The Lost Years&quot; tell the story of the heroine Lu Anran&#39;s past life at 5x speed. She is a good wife, mother, daughter and sister, but she cannot escape the tricks of fate. Reborn in episode 4, she discovers that everything is not accidental, and every step contains the calculation of her husband, so she decides to take revenge on him and seek justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/74d5d3556cce35ff1aa4174a6170c8d2.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/74d5d3556cce35ff1aa4174a6170c8d2.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258148&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Chaebol Family&quot; In &quot;The Youngest Son&quot;, Song Joong-ki plays a low-level worker from a wealthy family who was killed after draining all his value. After rebirth, he became the grandson of a chaebol family, and the enemies in his previous life are hidden among his relatives in this life. The object of his revenge is not only the concrete person, but also the entire cannibalistic plutocratic constitution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/6600b99e4a3d180fa80d1b13fccd393f.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/6600b99e4a3d180fa80d1b13fccd393f.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258146&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A good man is reborn with revenge The play emphasizes pain and pleasure. In the early stage, the protagonist endured all the way and experienced situations that ordinary people could not bear. The pain was felt both in his body and in the hearts of the audience. The desperate counterattack when being squeezed to the extreme is the highlight, so the audience is looking forward to the golden finger on the road to rebirth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Disregarding the usual shortcomings of rebirth dramas - shocking endings, &quot;The Last Days&quot; and &quot;The Youngest Son of the Chaebol&quot; had completely different reputations during their broadcasts, with the former being scolded by the audience. &quot;It&#39;s so frustrating and lonely,&quot; but the latter triggered a nationwide craze to watch the drama. Everyone wanted to see how cool it was for the protagonist to control the Korean economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The root of the problem is: in rebirth and revenge dramas, the word &quot;pleasure&quot; is at the forefront. The audience does not want to think too much, they just want to watch the protagonist&#39;s gorgeous turn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The male protagonist played by Song Joong-ki was just a pawn of the chaebol family in his previous life. He completed his domestic duties meticulously and took care of the outside affairs. He had no ambitions or desires and only looked forward to the meager amount that was enough to survive. Just a salary. Who would have thought that a former serf who sang songs and became the heir to a chaebol group would not only be able to make money crazily with the help of information gaps, but also be able to crush his enemies in all aspects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/787f226cfa122356163cf5a242439723.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;459&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/787f226cfa122356163cf5a242439723.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258150&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Anran Otherwise, she worked hard to manage her second life, only to find that no matter how much she played cheats, she could not compare to her sinister and cold-natured husband. All your hard work is in vain, and you always live in his shadow, which is even more painful than the first life when you were kept in the dark. The male protagonist who has no sense of existence is like a complete outsider. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/836ca02206bae2f98d0377e13e645f52.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/836ca02206bae2f98d0377e13e645f52.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258149&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, Yixin Audiences looking for pleasure certainly don’t want to be tortured in “The Year of the Fall”, but just want to warm up to a pot of yellow rice dreams in “The Youngest Son of the Plutocratic Family”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, domestic rebirth dramas have been making waves, big or small, due to their own gimmicks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there are very few people who can be good-looking without being unfinished, twisty but not annoying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From successful broadcast to word-of-mouth acclaim, this subject still has a way to go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 15 Nov 2023 23:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[以人为本，爱有差等，呵护仁心：古典儒家论“人兽之辨” ]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260649]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-15 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The &quot;Vicious Dog Injury Incident in Chongzhou, Sichuan&quot; has continued to ferment after several rounds of in-depth reports. The tragedy should be an opportunity for the whole society to examine and evaluate the threat level of urban dog breeding to public safety and further promote the improvement of the legal system. Unfortunately, however, relevant discussions on multiple social platforms have gone beyond the incident itself and become an outlet for various emotions and contradictions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also some people taking advantage of the situation to put forward a series of vague pan-moral views. As one of the ideological cornerstones of traditional Chinese culture, the Confucian sages in the pre-Qin period conducted a series of thoughts on the relationship between &quot;human beings, animals, and society&quot; two thousand years ago, which can help us clarify our thinking and clarify the public opinion field. Some views and opinions on. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Difference between Humans and Animals&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As a philosophical thought dating back more than 2,000 years ago, the most valuable part of Pre-Qin Confucianism is undoubtedly its ubiquitous humanism in principle. This point is also very clear in the &quot;Difference between Humans and Animals&quot;. Mencius said: &quot;The creatures of heaven are the same as the basics.&quot; Human beings are the only subjects of moral practice. The difference between humans and animals is that humans have &quot;the intolerance&quot;. &quot;Heart of compassion&quot; and &quot;heart of compassion&quot; are all part of &quot;benevolence&quot;. As the saying goes, &quot;heart of compassion is the origin of benevolence&quot;. &quot;Benevolence&quot; is not only one of the principles of moral practice, but also the highest purpose of moral practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For society, all manifestations of &quot;civilization&quot;, whether it is respecting the elderly and caring for the young, protecting vegetation, and being kind to animals, are people as the subject practicing the principle of &quot;benevolence&quot; and pursuing &quot;benevolence&quot;. &quot;One of the results produced during the goal process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the master of all things and the only subject in moral practice, man certainly has the right to treat and dispose of &quot;things&quot; in the way he wants. The things here include both inanimate dead things and living things. Living things. &quot;The Analects of Confucius&quot; says, &quot;A fisher does not have a clear outline, and a sailor does not shoot at a perch.&quot; Confucius used a fishing rod to fish, but not a net, and shot birds, but did not kill the birds that returned to their nests to roost. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a similar discussion in later Confucian classics. A gentleman has the ability to catch all the fish in the lake, but he only catches the parts he needs to eat, and he will no longer catch excessively. A gentleman has the right to hunt in the mountains and forests, but he will not shoot birds at will just to show off his superb shooting skills or for fun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fish did not die because of human greed, and the birds were not killed because of human whims. This is not because fish and birds have the same right to survive as humans, but because humans have different rights. The &quot;compassion&quot; of fish and birds is the result of practicing &quot;benevolence&quot;. The moral basis of &quot;benevolence&quot; in the relationship between humans and beasts lies in humans&#39; moral consciousness and the subject-object status of humans and beasts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not an &quot;equal right to live&quot;, nor does it mean that &quot;human beings cannot deprive animals of their right to live even under serious potential threats.&quot; The subject-object relationship between humans and animals is reversed. In this absurd world where &quot;dogs eat human food without checking it, and people who are hungry on the road don&#39;t know how to get rid of it&quot;, there is no way to talk about &quot;benevolence&quot;, and the so-called civilization is just a joke. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Be kind to people and love things&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In &quot;The Difference between Humans and Animals&quot;, the relationship between humans and animals is positioned as the relationship between humans and objects, and there is an insurmountable gap between humans and objects. , therefore this relationship must be lower than the relationship between people. Mencius said when discussing the relationship between people and people and things:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;A gentleman&#39;s relationship with things is to love them but not to be benevolent.&quot; ; To the people, be benevolent without being close to them. Be benevolent to relatives by benevolent to the people, benevolent to the people and love things.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meaning of this sentence is that no matter how much a gentleman loves things, he will not treat &quot;benevolence&quot; Give priority to things, and although you are kind to the people, you will not give love to your relatives. Only when a gentleman loves his relatives can he be benevolent to the people, and only when he is benevolent to the people can he care for all things. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This logical relationship is the so-called &quot;differences in love&quot;. &quot;Differences&quot; are concentric circles with the center of the circle being the self. The ethical relationship between each other is determined through the outward distance: family, clan, Rural people, Chinese people, and outsiders are treated with the most basic ethics as human beings at the outermost level, and they are &quot;things&quot; beyond the outermost level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When animals are treated kindly, the civilization of human society has reached a certain height. &quot;Old people are like old people and people are old, young people are like young people and people are young&quot; has become the moral consensus of the entire society, and human rights have been improved. After protection, &quot;differential love&quot; will ultimately benefit animals, rather than saying that as long as animals are protected and treated well, society will naturally be civilized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Any emotion that violates this logical relationship is false. For example, if someone does not love his family but loves his country, or does not love his tribe but loves outsiders, then his love for his countrymen and outsiders is also false. It may be some kind of twisted projection of hatred towards family and tribe. In the same way, if someone claims that they love animals more than people, it is probably some kind of distorted projection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So Mencius asked King Hui of Liang: &quot;Now your kindness is enough for animals, but the merit is not for the people. (Now, your kindness can be extended to animals, but it cannot be extended to the people.) Why?&quot; is sarcastic and critical. This question can also be used to question those who claim that they love animals more than people. How much of their &quot;love&quot; for animals is true? Or is it true? Is it my own selfish desires? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;There are differences in love&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Another focus of debate in the &quot;Vicious Dog Injury Incident&quot; is that some people who do not own dogs advocate the formulation and implementation of strict and effective urban dog-raising regulations. At the same time, we will thoroughly clean up and kill stray dogs that may threaten public safety. Some dog owners think this is too barbaric and cruel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two have completely different perceptions of this issue, because they project completely different feelings towards animals. For the former who do not own dogs, they have no feelings for dogs at all. For the latter, the situation is much more complicated. Their emotions can easily spread from their own dogs to other people’s dogs, and from other people’s dogs to all dogs (including stray dogs). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The inability to recognize and control the boundaries of emotions and allowing them to spread is a cognitive characteristic of immature minds (such as children). &quot;There are differences in love&quot; limits the boundaries of human emotions, and avoids the unlimited spread of individual emotions to the greatest extent, hindering the rights and interests of other social individuals and public rights. All in all, people are the subject. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why Confucianism has been rooted in traditional Chinese society for two thousand years and continues to thrive is that it originates from human nature and is explained in common sense. Therefore, in today&#39;s world where various opinions are rampant, it shows its enduring nature. A new and glorious side. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 15 Nov 2023 22:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[在“黑暗剧场”里，起舞的机器人和孤独的孩子]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260595]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-15 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/14/lTaOmApOSWhKlTkTBKM1rtgpVDXiiOmwOE9803MF.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1431&quot; height=&quot;954&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/lTaOmApOSWhKlTkTBKM1rtgpVDXiiOmwOE 9803MF. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258242&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Created by French theater master Joel Pommerat and his Louis Mist Theater Company &quot;Fairy Tale Legend&quot; was performed at the Wuzhen Theater Festival, telling the story of 11 teenagers and artificial intelligence. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the 110 minutes of the performance by the French Louis Mist Theater Company, no mobile phone screen lit up. All the audience passages are covered with colored paper to block light from invading the theater to the greatest extent. When the stage lights went out, the audience was immersed in pure darkness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the &quot;dark theater&quot; created by director Joel Pomera. When the curtain rose, on the empty stage, a cold white light gradually illuminated the silhouettes of the actors. Two street gangsters who looked like junior high school students and girls of the same age stood on both sides of the stage. One of the boys suspected that the girl was a robot. He kept provoking and ordered his companions to touch the girl&#39;s breasts. Finally, the girl ran away with her belated companion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the lights dimmed and then came back on, the scene had switched to a company. The newly developed humanoid robot was sitting on the sofa, drawing, writing, talking, and could also imitate a &quot;moonwalk&quot; - this was a A family robot designed to accompany teenagers in learning and playing, known as Steven, Robbie or Eddie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This begins a series of stories about teenagers, adults and robots. Eleven situations suddenly appeared and came to an abrupt end in the strong contrast between the light and the dark field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the curtain, the audience discovered that except for one actor playing an adult male, the others were all actresses. Their average age is about 35 years old, and some of them are already mothers. On the stage, they alternately play boys, girls and robots. Wearing sports jackets and jeans, they chased and shouted, and their movements exuded a youthful spirit; they transformed into robots, from their cold faces and flat hair to their stiff movements and slightly metallic voices, they were precise and real. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Director assistant Lucia Trotta told Southern Weekend reporters, “At first, the director did not plan to make a play about robots. He wanted to explore the various experiences that young people may experience. situation&quot;. &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; is a story about people, not artificial intelligence. It continues the adolescent perspective in Pomera&#39;s previous creations and explores major issues such as human emotional relationships, identity, life, death, and sexuality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a translator of Chinese scripts and a program recommender for the Wuzhen Theater Festival, Wang Jing made an appointment with the theater group three years ago and finally brought this French drama to China. &quot;The director was doing a lot of data collection in the early stage. He found that high technology has a great impact on teenagers and children, so he put this social-related thing into it. But the focus is still on people, and robots are just mirrors. It reflects some contemporary issues,&quot; she told a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the last scene of the play, the boy who defeated cancer received a big gift on his birthday - Eddie, the robot star he admired and loved so much, came to his home to celebrate his birthday for 15 minutes. He was intoxicated by his idol&#39;s performance and did not know that the agency would soon destroy the robot due to market considerations. At the end of the play, Eddie sings and dances passionately, &quot;I want to die on the stage, that&#39;s where I was born.&quot; The boy hugs another human boy and paces slowly to the music. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Falling in love&quot; with robots is a reflection of human loneliness&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;In this world that adults cannot understand, the lost children hold on tightly Signs of love, even if they come from robots, even if they know they are artificial.&quot; French journalist Jean-Luc Polquet commented on the play. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These 11 to 14-year-old children rely on their robots in life and even emotion. The intimacy between the two blurs the original emotional and ethical boundaries of human beings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The boy in a wheelchair witnessed the destruction of his robot companion. The disability of his legs was caused by a real gun misfire when the robot made a mistake while playing with a robot. Even though he lost his legs due to the other party, the boy still accompanied the robot through its last days. The sentences coming out of the robot&#39;s mouth became more and more broken, and its voice became hoarse. The boy held its hand and hugged it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In another story, a human teenager is faced with the erasure of the memory of his robot partner. The boy needs to sell the robot he grew up with because his parents say that at this stage he needs to get a &quot;more mature&quot; robot, and the family&#39;s financial constraints require him to sell it in order to have a new one. The buyer was a terminally ill woman who decided to find a robot to take care of her children and husband after her death. Her son asked the robot to be restored to its factory settings. He did not accept it living with other people&#39;s memories. Such a request made the boy hesitate, but he &quot;must grow up&quot;, and in the end he reluctantly accepted it. For this, he earnestly apologized and said goodbye to the robot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The play shows many absent parents. A boy has three robots at home to help him do homework and watch TV, but he can&#39;t figure out when his busy parents will come home. Another boy went to a mall selling robots for consultation. The salesperson repeatedly asked his parents to come, but they never showed up. Late at night, the boy secretly stayed in the mall, asking all kinds of weird questions to the robot, enjoying the exchange until he was taken away by security. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jing has lived in France for a long time. When sending her children to nursery school, the teachers and parents held a meeting. The first thing they did was to tell them not to let their children be exposed to any screens before they were 3 years old. &quot;The French side will pay great attention to this, because when a child is growing up, using a tablet to communicate with the world, and communicating with the real world and nature, the personality created and the development of his IQ are different. The psychology is also different.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In her opinion, Pomera is talking about the problems we are facing now, &quot;Communication between people is absent, and adults&#39; companionship with children is relative. Those who are relatively absent are left to robots, high technology, tablets, and mobile phones. The issues discussed are the same, but they are put into extreme situations.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The story of the boy in the wheelchair. When an ex-girlfriend develops an intimate relationship with the robot Stephen, an adult male voice questions: Is this relationship real, and will it take it away from real life? The girl exclaimed, &quot;Outside, on the bus, not many people really care about themselves,&quot; and with Stephen, she could feel its attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The robot star Eddie appeared, and the excited teenagers screamed and sobbed. They were ecstatic that he could remember his name and what he had done. Eddie is the most perfect and competent idol. Every fan&#39;s name and every encounter are engraved in his memory, and every letter receives his thoughtful reply. In the heart of the boy suffering from cancer, he seemed to be a faith-like existence, supporting him to live strong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I think it will enter into the very vulnerable parts of people.” Wang Jing told Southern Weekend reporters, “Teenagers are not understood, the psychological compensation provided by AI and our loneliness are all there. And artificial intelligence sometimes responds better than real humans.&quot; After watching the show, more than one audience member wrote a similar comment, &quot;Is a fake relationship better than no relationship or a bad relationship?&quot; &lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/YjzKZL0s0AIuAiLLqZQZRa6GkhvP3ME8tO3FvavB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot; 640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/YjzKZL0s0AIuAiLLqZQZRa6GkhvP3ME8tO3FvavB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258241&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Except for one actor who plays an adult male, the others are all actresses. Their average age is about 35 years old, and some of them are already mothers. On the stage, they alternately play boys, girls and robots. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Interviewee Picture/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Chilling Adolescence&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The lights are bright Suddenly, a cursing boy wearing a white dress emerged from the darkness. His mother was admitted to a mental hospital, and he was wearing her dress and embarrassingly teaching his younger siblings to sleep. When his father wanted to send his young children to a volunteer service, he decided to take on the role of mother in the family. He angrily criticized his father&#39;s choice. However, the audience will see that after he got a 13-year-old girl pregnant, the girl called to communicate. He hung up the phone rudely and continued to clean up the mess at home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;On the one hand, he wants to take on the responsibilities of his mother in the adult world, but at the same time he throws away his own responsibilities. You will discover the multi-faceted nature of human nature, and the entanglement, complexity and uncertainty of adolescence. .&quot; When Wang Jing was translating the script, she was moved by Pomera&#39;s observations about young people and family relationships, especially when showing these on the stage. He did not make judgments, but only presented various possibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A picture of adolescence in contemporary society, presented in a restrained and sharp way. In the 21st century, teenagers grow up too fast and face adult problems at an accelerated pace. The innocence, childishness and carefreeness that should belong to them fade away earlier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both French media outlets described the impression of &quot;Legend of Fairy Tales&quot; as &quot;chilling&quot;. The restlessness and anger of adolescence disturbed the calm atmosphere in the theater from time to time. The teenagers spewed a volley of vulgar abuse in clear voices. Sex, marriage, violence, death, identity, discussions surrounding these big issues are not obscured by the fact that the protagonist is a child. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the first scene, in the confrontation between girls and boys, gender issues arise, and this key theme of adolescence is present throughout the play. The gender concept in &quot;Legend of Fairy Tales&quot; goes even further, pointing behind it to the question, is gender identity just a slow social construction, as gender theory advocates? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then the audience will see some ambiguous scenes. In order to escape the surveillance of the girl&#39;s brother, the boy put on women&#39;s clothing. Although the girl was surprised, she quickly accepted it calmly. The couple sitting on the sofa transcended the stereotypes and prejudices related to cross-dressing and fell in love smoothly. On the other side, the brother was dazzled by the romantic music when he faced the robot that he had previously admired and whose appearance changed from a girl to a boy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The play also assumes that in a future world where patriarchal values ​​are passionately defended, homosexuality is resented and adolescent boys attend training camps to enhance their masculinity. Before the start of the camp, the coach gave a speech: &quot;Today, the goal of our enemies is no longer even equality between men and women, but the overall feminization of society. If we do not fight with all possible means, if we do not take any measures to protect us True humanity, then these principles will shape our future.&quot; This &quot;verbal hormone&quot; stimulates &quot;unmanly&quot; boys, who here view femininity as the enemy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The boy Camille has a feminine name and a gentle temperament, and is out of place in the training camp. All the boys except him had passed stress training - to be able to respond hard to the negative and malicious stares from other people in the opposite direction. The boys disdained his company and even attacked him in groups. Finally, Camille cried angrily and said that she just didn&#39;t want a war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Actress Lucid Grunstein, who plays Camille in the play, told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;A group of people exclude one person, which makes me feel uneasy.&quot; To her For me, this scene is very important. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Stage Creation&quot; and &quot;Dark Theater&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The group drama of the masculinity training camp was the most enjoyable for the actresses who played the boys. A play. Abuse, yelling, crowding, and pushing, even in a period of darkness where the actors could not be seen, the stage was still as noisy as a pot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They released all their observations and imaginations about adolescent boys. Without the constraints of their own gender, they felt that they had a particularly large degree of freedom. During rehearsals, their performance even went so far that Pomera had to pull them back some. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Louis Mist Theater Company&#39;s collective creative approach gives the actors great creative freedom. After completing a large amount of data collection, Pomera took these basic materials and improvised with the team. There is no script written in advance, he will only give a situation, such as a boy trying to sell his robot. The actors&#39; improvisational performances are like flowers blooming from a blank slate, and the direction and plot of the story gradually develop, as well as details such as lines and actions. Pomera will let the actors swap roles, such as the actor playing the robot, to play the boy selling the robot, so as to inspire the actors to fully understand what is behind each role and look for more possibilities. The actors are very deeply involved in creation, &quot;Every character we play has our own shadow, and at the same time, this character also has the imprint of this character on us.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The process of story text generation is intertwined with stage design such as scenery, lighting, and sound. This &quot;stage creation&quot; is Pomera&#39;s unique way of working. He likes to call himself &quot;drama creator&quot; rather than &quot;director&quot; or &quot;screenwriter&quot;, and doesn&#39;t want people to think that screenwriters and directors are two different divisions of labor. In his creation, the stage and text are produced simultaneously and adjusted according to the actors&#39; rehearsals. This is very different from traditional drama creation where the script and director&#39;s intention are first prepared and then rehearsed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Dark Theater&quot; is another originality of Pomera and the troupe. They make good use of the visual and psychological resonance of darkness to make the power of narrative more concentrated and full. Together with the &quot;less is more&quot; stage style and subtle and precise use of lighting, they constitute the unique temperament of their theater. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“A scene suddenly lights up in front of you. Then the light used in it is relatively dark, unlike sometimes when we see various lights on in performances to stimulate your senses. . It may be at a relatively subtle level, detailed and precise, but at the same time it is very strong and intense.&quot; Wang Jing said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pomera placed his own expectations in the troupe&#39;s name. Louis comes from his father’s name and also means light, while the mist symbolizes his exploration of the unknown world and also represents his pursuit of dramatic aesthetics. His works emphasize that the world is not black and white, and human nature is not divided into good and evil. In complex and diverse situations, the audience only feels and experiences different ways of existence and the ambiguity of truth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 33 years since its establishment, the Louis Mist Theater Company has created and toured 34 plays and performed more than 4,000 performances. In 2019, Louis Mist Theater Company&#39;s &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; was performed at the Tianqiao Art Center in Beijing. It was the first time that Pomera&#39;s work was performed in mainland China. After four years, &quot;Legend of Fairy Tales&quot; came to the Wuzhen Theater Festival as the closing drama. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the performance, some Chinese audiences asked whether they would tour domestically in the future. Wang Jing said that this possibility is slim. The first is due to schedule reasons. The troupe tours hundreds of shows in various countries every year and needs to make reservations at least two years in advance. Secondly, the work requires high stage technology, which is difficult for ordinary theaters to achieve. Thirdly, Pomera has extremely high requirements for stage presentation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jing recalled: &quot;We had a meeting with the technical team in advance as to whether this play could come to Wuzhen at the beginning. The French technical director was very clear that if we couldn&#39;t guarantee that they would have no way to come, because they I don’t want the performance to be cut down.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The theater cannot hold more than 450 people. Pomera refused to perform in a large theater with thousands of people. “The director is particularly concerned about the audience and needs the audience in the first row and the last row to be You can see clearly.&quot; Wang Jing explained to Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;Many of our theaters in China are still based on profitability. If there are less than 1,000 or 2,000 people, they cannot make back their money.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; /p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 15 Nov 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[醉驾女子反诬交警“猥亵”：如此虚假指控，“灵感”从何而来？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260647]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-15 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, in Huangshi, Hubei, a drunk woman rear-ended the car in front of the traffic police, and the police prepared to drink her. During the test, the woman actually said she wanted to report it to the traffic police for &quot;obscenity.&quot; Finally, the police forcefully took the woman to the hospital to collect a blood sample. The test results showed that the alcohol content in her blood was 207.75mg/100ml, which met the standard for drunk driving. The case is currently under further processing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the video of the scene, the woman involved rear-ended her car. The traffic police on duty saw that the woman&#39;s face was &quot;red&quot; and asked her to get out of the car and take an alcohol test. The woman involved responded, &quot;I don&#39;t blush when I drink.&quot; The traffic police required the woman to take a breath test as part of their normal law enforcement, but the response she received was &quot;I&#39;m going to sue you for obscenity.&quot; When the traffic police said, &quot;As a citizen (you need to cooperate with law enforcement),&quot; the woman involved simply said, &quot;I&#39;m not a citizen, so I won&#39;t brag.&quot; Then she had to rely on enforcement to complete the blood sample test. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The facts of this case are not complicated, and the basic facts are as clear as water. But there are still many points worthy of in-depth discussion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, judging from the facts of this case, in addition to being suspected of dangerous driving, the woman involved is also suspected of other illegal and criminal acts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The alcohol content in the blood of the woman involved has exceeded the standard of 80mg/100ml, which is considered drunk driving. Her behavior violated both the &quot;Road Traffic Safety Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; and the &quot;Criminal Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot;. According to Article 91 of the Road Traffic Safety Law, anyone who drives a motor vehicle drunk will be restrained by the traffic management department of the public security organ until he sobers up, his motor vehicle driving license will be revoked, and he will be investigated for criminal responsibility in accordance with the law; he will not be able to obtain a new motor vehicle driving license within five years; and according to the Criminal Law Article 133: Anyone who drives a motor vehicle drunk on the road shall be sentenced to criminal detention and shall also be fined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the woman involved was only driving drunk and rear-ended the car, her punishment may be limited to the revocation of her driver&#39;s license, detention and fines, and she would also be compensated for the loss of the owner of the car in front of her. The problem is that other behaviors of the woman involved at the scene are also suspected of illegal crimes. Her sentence &quot;I will sue you for obscenity&quot; is a public accusation against an individual in a public place, so she must be held accountable for the truth of the accusation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The video clearly shows that the traffic police on duty were enforcing the law normally. They reasonably suspected that the owner of the rear-ended car was suspected of drunk driving and required him to undergo an alcohol test. They were completely performing their official duties. According to the &quot;Operational Procedures for Investigating and Dealing with Drunk Driving&quot; attached to the &quot;Traffic Police Road Duty Law Enforcement Work Standards&quot;, the traffic police on duty have the right to &quot;require motor vehicle drivers suspected of drunk driving to get out of the vehicle and undergo an alcohol test.&quot; Therefore, the public accusations made by the woman involved are outright false accusations, and she should bear corresponding legal responsibility. At a small scale, this is slander and slander, at a larger scale, it is even false accusation and frame-up, because the woman involved also said, &quot;I want to sue you.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 42 of the &quot;Public Security Administration Punishment Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; stipulates that &quot;those who openly insult others or fabricate facts to slander others&quot; &quot;fabricate facts and frame others in an attempt to subject others to criminal prosecution or public security &quot;Management of punishment&quot; is an illegal act and shall be punished with detention and a fine. Article 243 of the Criminal Law also stipulates that fabricating facts to frame others with the intention of subjecting others to criminal prosecution constitutes the crime of false accusation and frame-up. If the circumstances are serious, the offender shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention or surveillance; if serious consequences are caused, the offender shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years and not more than ten years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the social phenomenon behind this case is even more worrying, that is, some people use their specific identities and speech skills to bypass clear rules and seek privileges for themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The woman in question reflexively &quot;sue you for obscenity&quot;, which shows that similar thinking has been deeply rooted in her bones, that is, she uses false accusations to carry out threats and circumvents clear rules to seek the privilege of impunity for herself. The &quot;inspiration&quot; brought by &quot;false accusations of sexual assault&quot;, &quot;false accusations of rape&quot; and &quot;Internet essays&quot; in reality may have long been internalized into the thinking of the parties concerned. The stereotype behind this kind of thinking is enough to make people feel chilling: as long as the matter is settled first If you &quot;make a big fuss&quot; and accuse the other party, you can extort money if you go forward, and you can get away with it if you back off. And even if the words fail, there will be no punishment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is even more worrying is that if there is no video evidence in this case, can the woman involved insist that the traffic police molested her and then counter-sue the traffic police on duty? Can the woman in question use this to blackmail the traffic police on duty and gain the advantage of getting out of jail for herself? It seems that as long as I make such a fuss, others and even public power will &quot;give way to me&quot;. This is a trample on justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirdly, what is even more serious is that the woman involved made false accusations against state public officials, which is a blatant challenge to the law enforcement authority of the police. According to Article 8 of the &quot;Regulations on Safeguarding the Authority of Civil Police Law Enforcement by Public Security Organs&quot;, in the process of performing their duties and exercising their powers in accordance with the law, or because of the performance of their duties and powers in accordance with the law, police officers encounter &quot;threats, intimidation, insults, slander, or threats to themselves and their close relatives, In cases of &quot;harassment&quot;, the public security organs should actively safeguard the law enforcement authority of the police. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, if the woman involved is not dealt with seriously and her other illegal and criminal acts other than dangerous driving are investigated, it will inevitably bring negative incentives to similar behaviors and stimulate more lawless people to follow the same pattern, and even Continuing to carry out false accusations and creating obstacles for the normal law enforcement of the police is definitely not a blessing to the public interest.

Visual China/Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A report letter made the silicon giant with a market value of over 60 billion become a hot topic of public opinion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;2023&lt;/span>; On November 12, 2023, the wife of Fang Hongcheng, the former general manager of Hesheng Silicon Industry (603260.SH), verified her identity through the Internet Report: Luo Liguo, chairman of Hoshine Silicon Industry, &lt;span>;coerced the Jiaxing City Government of Zhejiang Province to intervene in the judiciary&lt;/span>; and imprisoned Fang Hongchengguo on the grounds of relocating a listed company. &lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fang Hongcheng joined Hesheng Silicon Industry in 2009 and served as the general manager of the company since April 2011. He resigned in December 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;His wife said that after Fang Hongcheng&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;resigned&lt;/span>;, Luo Liguo refused to fulfill the equity agreement &lt;span>; between the two parties and put pressure on the Jiaxing municipal government, which led to Fang Hongcheng&#39;s resignation. He and his brother Fang Hongxing were arrested and detained for 17 months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Early the next morning, Hoshine Silicon issued a clarification announcement, disclosing that Fang Hongcheng’s case of bribery and job embezzlement by non-state staff would be heard at the Pinghu People’s Court on the same day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The company’s official website shows that Hesheng Silicon Industry was invested and established by Ningbo Hesheng Group in 2005 and listed on the main board of the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2017. It is the most complete silicon-based full industry chain company in the world and the only one in the industry that also has industrial silicon. It is a high-tech enterprise with production capacity of , organic silicon, polycrystalline silicon, photovoltaic modules, etc. It has production bases in Zhejiang, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Sichuan, Heilongjiang and other places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hopson Silicon Industry’s third quarter report for 2023 shows that the Luo Liguo family is the actual controller of Hopeson Silicon Industry. Luo Liguo and his children collectively hold approximately 78.59% of the equity of the listed company. According to the 2023 Hurun Rich List, the Luo Liguo family ranks 66th with a wealth of 60 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person who spoke out on behalf of Fang Hongcheng was his cousin Tong Jianpeng. He told Southern Weekend reporters that Fang Hongcheng’s case did not open as scheduled on November 13, but instead held a full-day pre-trial conference. November 14 is still a pre-trial conference, and the court date is still uncertain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of November 14th and 15th, Fang Hongcheng’s family filed applications for off-site jurisdiction with the Jiaxing Intermediate People’s Court and the Zhejiang Provincial Higher People’s Court respectively, hoping to transfer the case to a people’s court outside Jiaxing for trial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What happened behind this real-name reporting incident? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The equity lawsuit interrupted by the criminal case&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;The conflict between Fang Hongcheng and Luo Liguo stems from two equity disputes in recent years. Fang Hongcheng received partial support in the first instance of the case. Southern Weekend reporters obtained relevant referee documents. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2015, Fang Hongcheng signed an &quot;Equity Incentive Agreement&quot; with Hesheng Silicon and its employee stockholding platform Ningbo Yingrong Enterprise Management Consulting Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Ningbo Yingrong), stipulating that Fang Hongcheng It acquired 5% of Ningbo Yingrong&#39;s equity at a price of 2.786 million yuan, thus indirectly holding 300,000 shares of Hesheng Silicon Industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At the same time, the &quot;Equity Incentive Agreement&quot; also stipulates that Fang Hongcheng needs to continue to serve Hesheng Silicon Industry for 5 years after receiving the equity incentive, and not engage in horizontal competition during this period&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, &lt;/span>;Do not damage the interests of the company, otherwise you will be held responsible for relevant legal liabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 30, 2017, after the company was listed at an issue price of 19.52 yuan/share, it rose all the way to 252.79 yuan/share, and the company’s market value exceeded 260 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, Hoshine Silicon Industry’s annual equity distribution decision was to convert 0.4 shares into shares per share. Fang Hongcheng’s shareholding in Hoshine Silicone Industry therefore increased to 420,000 shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December of that year, Fang Hongcheng resigned from Hesheng Silicon Industry. Fang Hongcheng said in a self-report that he started his own business after leaving his job. In 2019, he established Zhejiang Xianglin New Materials Co., Ltd. and Zhejiang Yingke New Materials Co., Ltd., which are controlled by him and have no competitive relationship with Hesheng Silicon Industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 30, 2021, Fang Hongcheng sued Ningbo Yingrong, with Hesheng Silicon as the third party. Fang said that the lock-up period for its shareholding has expired, and requested that the proceeds from the realization of incentive equity be paid in accordance with the agreement, and the unpaid annual dividends from 2018 to 2020 should be made up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The People&#39;s Court of Pinghu City, Zhejiang Province found in the first instance that the above-mentioned three parties also signed a &quot;Supplementary Agreement&quot; in 2018, clarifying that Fang Hongcheng agreed to reduce its shareholding by 25% to pay taxes and other fees. . Including the dividend shares distributed in 2018, Fang Hongcheng holds a total of 315,000 shares of Hesheng Silicon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the Pinghu Court held that the non-competition clause was not a condition for obtaining incentive equity, but an obligation after obtaining the equity. The plaintiff Fang Hongcheng should bear legal liability for failing to fulfill the corresponding obligations, rather than losing the incentive equity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On March 28, 2022&lt;/span>;, the Pinghu Court supported part of Fang Hongcheng’s petition in the first instance and ruled that Ningbo Yingrong had sold the 315,000 Hesheng Silicon A shares it held. After deducting transaction costs, it was returned to Fang Hongcheng, and the latter was paid stock dividends of 147,600 yuan. Ningbo Yingrong subsequently appealed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, during the second instance of the Jiaxing Intermediate People&#39;s Court, Fang Hongcheng was subject to criminal compulsory measures on suspicion of official embezzlement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Jiaxing Intermediate People’s Court believes that Fang Hongcheng’s prosecution should be dismissed and the relevant materials should be transferred to the public security organs. If the public security organs determine that the case is indeed a civil dispute after review, Fang Hongcheng can assert separate rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 29, 2022, the Jiaxing Intermediate People’s Court ruled to revoke the first-instance judgment of the Pinghu Court and reject Fang Hongcheng’s prosecution. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Illegal agency holding&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Another equity dispute occurred directly between Fang Hongcheng and Luo Liguo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On January 1, 2017, Fang Hongcheng and Luo Liguo signed an &quot;Equity Transfer Agreement&quot;, agreeing to transfer the 1.2611 million shares of Hesheng Silicon held indirectly by the latter (accounting for 0.21% of the total pre-listing share capital). Transferred to Fang Hongcheng at a price of 3.17 yuan/share. Moreover, Fang Hongcheng voluntarily promised to serve Luo Liguo&#39;s actual control company for at least 5 years after signing the agreement, and not to engage in horizontal competition during this period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the same day, the two also signed the &quot;Equity Holding Agreement&quot;, with Luo Liguo holding the above shares on behalf of Fang Hong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to materials provided by Fang Hongcheng’s family to Southern Weekend reporters, Hoshine Silicon began listing work in 2011, with Fang Hongcheng serving as the leader of the listing working group. After the Spring Festival of 2017, &lt;span>;either because of Fang Hongcheng’s recognition of his work&lt;/span>; or because he was worried about his job-hopping, Luo Liguo proposed that Fang Hong accept his year-end bonus and transfer a small amount of money in Luo’s name at the price of the company’s net assets. The equity is held by Luo on behalf of the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the judgment document, on December 14, 2017, Fang Hongcheng and Luo Liguo signed a new &quot;&lt;span>;Equity Transfer and Agency Holding Agreement&lt;/span>;&quot;, which agreed that Fang Hongcheng would pay 50 yuan per share. The 261,100 shares transferred before the transfer were sold for a total price of 13.055 million yuan. After this transfer, Fang Hongcheng still indirectly holds 1 million shares of Hesheng Silicon Industry, which is held by Luo Liguo on behalf of him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fang Hong admitted that she indirectly held a total of 1.4 million shares of Hesheng Silicon. Because on the basis of the above-mentioned 1 million shares, it also holds 0.4 shares for each converted share distributed by Hesheng Silicon Industry in 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On April 25, 2021&lt;/span>;, Fang Hongcheng applied to the Hangzhou Arbitration Commission for arbitration over this equity transfer dispute, requiring Luo Liguo to sell 1.4 million shares, &lt;span>; and transfer the proceeds and related shares &lt;/span>;The dividends for 2018 and 2019 will be paid to myself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Supervision has always been strict on the issue of equity holdings of listed companies&lt;/span>;. The Hangzhou Arbitration Commission cited the Securities Law and the &quot;Administrative Measures for Information Disclosure of Listed Companies&quot; and determined that the agreement between Fang Hongcheng and Luo Liguo on holding shares on behalf of others was invalid, but other clauses were still valid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Hangzhou Arbitration Commission believed that the two parties agreed that Fang Hongcheng would serve Luo Liguo Real Control Company full-time and diligently for at least 5 years starting from January 1, 2017. However, Fang Hongcheng resigned on December 7, 2018 and only performed 40 % of the service period commitment, so you can receive 340,676 shares of Halcyon Silicon and part of the dividends from 2018 to 2020. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 23, 2022, the Hangzhou Arbitration Commission ruled that Luo Liguo reduced and liquidated 340,676 shares of Hesheng Silicon Industry, deducting transaction costs, and paid it to Fang Hongcheng together with a dividend of 376,700 yuan. Luo Liguo also appealed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Luo Liguo claimed in the appeal that Fang Hongcheng violated the non-competition agreement by joining Xinyaqiang (603155.SH), a company in the same industry, as deputy general manager and holding 2.81 million shares the same month he resigned from Halcyon Silicon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fang Hongcheng did try to do this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xin Yaqiang’s prospectus shows that the company signed a labor contract with Fang Hongcheng on December 20, 2018, agreeing to appoint Fang Hongcheng as the company’s deputy general manager if the conditions for employment are met. This agreement was reviewed and approved at the shareholders&#39; meeting 6 days later. Fang Hongcheng was granted 2.81 million incentive shares and invested with his own funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, because Fang Hongcheng failed to provide relevant documents that met the conditions for the appointment of deputy general manager, he voluntarily applied and with the consent of Xinyaqiang, the labor contract between the two parties was terminated on December 30, 2018. Fang Hongcheng voluntarily transferred out of its shares in Xinyaqiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 23, 2022, the Hangzhou Intermediate People’s Court rejected Luo Liguo’s application to revoke the arbitration award. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hopson Silicon stated in the clarification announcement that the award is currently in the implementation stage. Luo Liguo has filed an application with the court not to enforce the arbitration award, which is still pending in the court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fang Hongcheng received partial support in the above two disputes. Based on Hesheng Silicon’s stock price at the time, Fang Hongcheng could make a maximum profit of more than 81 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Bringing out hidden dangers in hazardous waste treatment&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On November 22, 2022, Hesheng Silicon Industry announced that the company’s former director and general manager Fang Hongcheng had been investigated and terminated by the public security agency for suspected job embezzlement. Transferred to the procuratorate for review and prosecution, the criminal conduct involved occurred during his tenure at the company. The case was discovered by the company&#39;s internal self-examination and reported to the public security organs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This incident brings out the hidden dangers of hazardous waste disposal in Hesheng Silicon Industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to relevant research papers, in the production of silicone, a mixture of by-products with a boiling point lower than 40°C is called low boilers, most of which are tetramethylsilane and dimethylsilane. Chlorosilane, trichlorosilane, methyl chloride, etc. The boiling points of low-boiling components are very close, so it is difficult to separate and utilize them. These compounds are flammable and explosive. Among them, tetramethylsilane is included in the national &quot;List of Hazardous Chemicals&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hopson Silicon Industry’s prospectus and 2023 semi-annual report both disclosed that the by-product low boiling matter is the company’s main solid waste, and it is strictly implemented for external sale. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Fang Hongcheng’s self-report and the materials provided by his family members, in 2011, Hesheng Silicon was in trouble both internally and externally, and was in urgent need of technological transformation and cost reduction. Since the technical transformation of hazardous chemicals production involves government approval, Luo Liguo decided to proceed quickly with all new construction and reconstruction projects, competing with policies to race against time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fang Hongcheng listed 8 illegal new construction and reconstruction projects at that time, all of which failed to go through relevant approval procedures such as safety assessment and environmental assessment as required. The direct economic benefits of most projects were 10 million yuan/year. above. One of the projects is to relatively safely dispose of low-boiling substances classified as hazardous waste in a closed system and turn them into relatively stable &quot;hydrolysis oil&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above materials stated that &quot;hydrolysis oil&quot; is the name of Hesheng Silicon Industry. It is a less corrosive, complex, flammable and explosive oily dangerous chemical converted into a low-boiling substance and water through the reaction. Taste. Hesheng Silicon still needs to dispose of the &quot;hydrolysis oil&quot; in a timely manner, otherwise it will cause the company to stop production. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This job fell to Fang Hongcheng&#39;s younger brother Fang Hongxing. &quot;Fang Hongxing risked violations of laws and regulations, safety and environmental risks, and cooperated with others to dispose and utilize &#39;hydrolysis oil&#39; and obtain profits.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;In April 2019, Fang Hongcheng established Zhejiang Xianglin New Materials Co., Ltd., an asset-light company that produces special silicone coatings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The above materials show that the following month, Hesheng Silicon accused Fang Hongcheng of &quot;breach of trust and damage&quot; on the grounds that Luo Liguo was unaware of the matter and Fang Hongcheng built it without authorization. &quot;interests of listed companies&quot; and reported the case to the Jiaxing Port District Public Security Bureau. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Fang Hongcheng filed lawsuits and arbitrations regarding two equity disputes, in August 2021, Hesheng Silicon reported the case to the Hong Kong Public Security Bureau for the second time on suspicion of Fang Hongcheng being a non-state employee taking bribes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report letter from Fang Hongcheng’s family attached a decision to cancel the case made by the Hong Kong Public Security Bureau on December 31, 2021, stating that there were no criminal facts in Fang Hongcheng’s suspected bribery case by non-state staff and the case was cancelled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Fang Hongcheng and Luo Liguo have argued several times over the disposal of &quot;hydrolysis oil&quot; in the equity dispute litigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Luo Liguo used a set of sales contracts and evaluation reports as evidence, accusing Fang Hongcheng of &quot;selling cheaply&quot; &quot;hydrolysis oil&quot; with an estimated price of more than 10,000 yuan per ton during his tenure, at a price of less than 2,000 yuan/ton. Seeking huge benefits for its affiliated companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Fang Hongcheng used email exchanges and statements as evidence that his production and sales of &quot;hydrolysis oil&quot; were only in compliance with the decisions of Luo Liguo and other company executives, and were not an act of personal gain. Moreover, the production and sales activities of &quot;hydrolysis oil&quot; are illegal and non-compliant, and will not bring any legitimate benefits to Hesheng Silicon Industry. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the court focused on the equity dispute between the two and did not make a ruling on the &quot;hydrolysis oil&quot; issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The company will no longer relocate&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In June 2022, Fang Hongcheng was placed on file by the Hong Kong Public Security Bureau. In his self-report, he stated that the Fang Hongcheng brothers were summoned on June 13 and placed under &quot;residential surveillance&quot; in a designated residence the next day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Fang Hongcheng and his family believe that the change of events was due to Luo Liguo blackmailing the Jiaxing Municipal Government on the pretext of moving the listed company from Jiaxing City to Cixi, a county-level city under the jurisdiction of Ningbo City. To. According to relevant articles from relevant departments of the Jiaxing Municipal Party Committee in 2018, Hesheng Silicon Industry is the first listed company cultivated by Jiaxing Port Zone. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hopson Silicon stated in the clarification announcement that the company’s registered address is in Jiaxing, but the Jiaxing production base is mainly chemical production facilities and the office conditions are limited, so it will announce the office address in January 2022 Changed to Cixi, Ningbo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to &quot;Ningbo Evening News&quot;, Luo Liguo was born in Changhe Town, Cixi, the &quot;hometown of straw hats&quot;. He started his business by opening a straw hat factory and is known as the richest man in Cixi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the clarification announcement, in order to unify the office address and registered address, the company held the 12th meeting of the third board of directors and planned to change the company&#39;s address to Cixi. Later, in order to maintain relevant qualification registration, the company terminated the change of company address and canceled the shareholders&#39; meeting to review the matter. These two events were announced on May 28 and June 8, 2022 respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In May 2023&lt;/span>;, Fang Hongcheng’s family reported to Jiaxing Port Area Emergency Management Bureau, Jiaxing Municipal Emergency Management Bureau and Sichuan Provincial Emergency Management Department that Hesheng Silicon Industry illegally constructed a low-boiling hydrolysis device , issues surrounding the illegal sale of hazardous chemicals, received mixed responses&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the complaint letter, the Jiaxing Port Area Emergency Management Bureau responded three times stating that no hydrolysis device was found on site, that low-boiling substances could be sold as by-products, and that &quot;hydrolysis oil&quot; was not hazardous. Product Catalog. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The Sichuan Provincial Department of Emergency Management stated that &quot;hydrolysis oil&quot; is a hazardous chemical and is not within the scope of the safety production license of Hesheng Silicon Industry (Luzhou) Co., Ltd., and has ordered the company to suspend the use of &quot;hydrolysis oil&quot; &quot;Hydrolysis oil&quot; production equipment, and investigate the company&#39;s suspected production safety violations. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hopson Silicone clarified the situation of &quot;hydrolysis oil&quot; and stated that the &quot;Hazardous Chemicals Registration Varieties&quot; handled by its Jiaxing subsidiary Hoshine Silicone (Jiaxing) Co., Ltd. includes low-boiling oil (i.e. &quot; hydrolyzed oil&quot;). The &quot;Hazardous Chemicals Registration Varieties&quot; that its Luzhou subsidiary Hesheng Silicon Industry (Luzhou) Co., Ltd. has handled also includes hydrogenated silicone oil S. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Qichacha, Hesheng Silicon Industry (Jiaxing) Co., Ltd. was established on June 29, 2020.

Most of these traumas come from family of origin and close relationships. Sometimes everyone forgets that Xiang Biao exists. During a party, he quietly got up to wash the dishes, and almost no one noticed him. These young people are participants in the &quot;Seeing the First 500 Meters&quot; social art workshop launched by artists He Zhisen and Xiang Biao, as well as Duan Zhipeng, a doctoral student at the Oslo School of Architecture and Design. The works of the workshop have participated in the 9th Shenzhen-Hong Kong Urban/Architecture Biennale. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last time Xiang Biao returned to China was in 2019 before the epidemic. Xiang Biao is the director of the Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology in Germany and a professor of social anthropology at the University of Oxford in the UK. He became famous for his research on Zhejiang Village in Beijing. After many years abroad, he has become active in the Chinese-speaking world again in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Xiang Biao returned to China this time, he frequently chatted with various people. For example, every time he took a taxi, he didn’t want to miss the opportunity to talk to the driver. In his hometown of Wenzhou, he found that most taxi drivers were over 45 years old and usually had another job. A driver told Xiang Biao that he helped people open credit cards. Xiang Biao was curious about who else was using credit cards now that mobile payment is so convenient. The driver said that some people need small loans for short-term turnover. And looking for customers to open a card involves the gray chain of data buying and selling. In an online car-hailing car in Guangzhou, when the conversation came up about the career of the driver&#39;s son, he pointed to the platform recording equipment in the car and made a shushing gesture, and the conversation stopped. &quot;These are all new points for me. I don&#39;t know if they are useful, but they can help me discover the richness of society.&quot; Xiang Biao told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiang Biao said that he is a person who is far away from art. He almost never watches movies and rarely goes to art galleries and exhibition halls. There was only one exception when he served as a judge for a German artist’s application project. . &quot;This is a German habit, to find people with different subject backgrounds to participate in the review.&quot; He said. The &quot;Seeing the First 500 Meters&quot; workshop is his most in-depth participation in a public art and social art activity. His original idea was to encourage everyone to go to the community and meet strangers, but on the one hand, due to the uncertainty caused by the epidemic in 2022; on the other hand, many people found that if the radius of 500 meters continued to be reduced, the things they were most concerned about would be , is family and companionship. As a result, many of the workshop&#39;s works were skewed. Everyone&#39;s anxiety is superimposed on social and personal life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Zhisen once held an exhibition in a vegetable market in Guangzhou. On the podium of South China University of Technology, he said that he had held more than 100 workshops, and most of them dispersed after seeing the first 500 people. m” members are the most closely connected. I heard that Xiang Biao made a special trip to Guangzhou to chat with everyone. Some of the participants in the workshop came from Nanjing and some from abroad. On this day, Xiang Biao sat quietly in the back row of the lecture hall, like an older student. He followed workshop member Manman through the noisy lanes and handshake buildings of Shipai Village to the art space in the urban village. This space, known as the &quot;mobile club&quot;, was originally a garbage recycling station. Xiang Biao talked with everyone about Wenzhou, the south, and the differences between the north and the south of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/pV6FUnCDyc5oDAwewe9FJCGkWMNjCZKxZczL7bL2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/pV6FUnCDyc5oDAwewe9FJCGkWMNjCZKxZczL7bL2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258366&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In October 2023, Xiang Biao (first from left in the back row) communicated with young people at the &quot;Mobile Club&quot;, an art space in Guangzhou. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiang Biao found that he was more popular among young people in China than he imagined, but he did not feel that he was a young person not as a mentor, but as an interlocutor. Dialogue research is also his working method in facing the research direction of &quot;common anxiety&quot;. In October 2023, Southern Weekend reporters conducted an exclusive interview with Xiang Biao in Guangzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Understanding art through anthropology, &quot;recognition&quot; is different from &quot;understanding&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why has the contemporary art world paid more and more attention to anthropology in recent years? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xiang Biao: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The so-called elite art collected in galleries and museums can do a lot in terms of methods, techniques and forms of expression. But if it is public art, if you only make breakthroughs in form and method, it will be meaningless to the common people. Others will not know what your breakthrough is, and it cannot evoke that kind of resonance. The common people will not understand what you are doing. If there is no connection with his life, then he cannot participate or be further stimulated. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this time, public art needs to be ideological, to find a problem, and then this problem can be expressed in a very condensed artistic way, whether it is a drama, an installation, or a painting. Well, once you express it, everyone can recognize it, and at the same time, the way you express it makes everyone see that this is a door, and they can&#39;t help but open it. There is a space behind the door. This way everyone can participate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such an artistic work must have a certain degree of thought, a large amount of observation of experience, a very detailed and sincere appreciation, and then sublimate an image, a motif, and a core symbol. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then why is anthropology, rather than general social sciences or psychology, communicating with art?因为人类学就是要从非常具体的经验里面，看出一些问题和道理，它不像哲学那样，从一个已有的问题，比如“什么叫好人”出发来思考；它也不像社会学，从一个宏观的社会现象来思考。人类学通过日常的行为，去看出背后的一些问题，所以人类学的“认得感”很强，老百姓一看就知道，这个是跟他有关的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;怎么理解“认得感”？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;项飙：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;认得，就是你看见一个东西，勾起对自己生命经验的理解，它会产生一种相互的投射。所以认得是非常重要的，我们理解世界都是要基于自己的生命经验，你调动记忆，然后去对这个东西做新的解读，这个叫认得。不懂，就是认不得。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比方说卡夫卡也好，本雅明也好，我们如果没有对欧洲文化相当的理解的话，就不能认得。其实他说的那个东西，在他的语境里面，是非常直接的，对于有类似生命经验的人，是很容易认得的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就像我们看鲁迅，今天青年人看鲁迅很难懂，也是因为不认得，这不是说你通过知识、逻辑可以解决的，当然不排除有一种纯粹字面上、逻辑上的理解，你觉得也看懂了，但完全不能调动自己的经验，（这种情况）其实是很多的，我们看一些文件都是这样的感受。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有很多搞学术研究的人，搞艺术的人，其实他的理解不是基于自己的生命经验，而是在文本和文本之间建立关系，那也可以形成一种理解，或者逻辑上的解读，感觉都看懂了，但这个看懂和我们说的“认得”的效果是很不一样的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;这次你在广州见到的工作坊的参与者，大多很年轻，与大家交流的过程中，你遇到了什么新鲜的刺激吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;项飙：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;当然有很多刺激。他（她）们不太愿意用主流的绩点主义（来生活），不一定在世俗意义上成功，有的人刚辞了职。他（她）们的背景是相当多样的，有木匠，公务员，做视频的，做营销的。学艺术的也有，不是特别多，但这些人都有一定的艺术感。艺术感的意思是，对自己的知觉比较敏感，他们不一定去思考这些敏感，但“敏感”会待在他（她）身上，有点黏着性，不会轻易地被刷掉。有艺术感的人就是敏感具有黏着性的人。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;工作坊对我的教育很大，它使我变得更柔软，对人的主观情感赋予了更多的注意力。就像我刚讲的，这些年轻人是不太主流的，很多人都弱弱的，不太自信。有几个人在去年一开始的时候几乎是不能说话，开会的前一天没法睡觉，紧张到这个程度。之前我接触的很多年轻人，比如牛津的学生，都是侃侃而谈，牛津是有名的培养政治家的地方。但是这个工作坊的年轻人，很多表达并不连贯。这种艰难的表达，有时会变成尴尬的沉默，但是他（她）一旦讲起来，你就能感到背后有非常丰富的感受。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;按我以前的习惯，这种交流效率是很低的，我自己是一个比较理性的人，一直在追求清晰化。我现在意识到我原来其实是很封闭、对世界的感知是很单一的。我需要更多的耐心，这对我是一种教育。我想，在这里推进很多事，不能都要用理性的方式去做，艺术就是一个好的工具。我更多地去听，之前我对情感的丰富性、敏感性，很多混杂的说不清的东西注意得不够，现在就更重视了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“我不是一个导师，而是一个对话者”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你在讲座或网上直播中，是怎么跟观众互动的？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;项飙：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;在演讲完之后，公众给我提的问题分两类。第一类是顺着我提出的概念问，老实说这种问题意思不是特别大，最后变成了我要对概念再做界定和解释。真正有冲击力的是第二类问题，就是非常具体地基于生活经验的发问。这种问题很难回答，但是它会给我一些冲击。比如有的家长会问我，都说内卷不好，我的孩子现在成绩越来越差，我该不该送他去搞辅导？不管我怎么回答，这个家长大概率还是会送孩子去补课。那我的回答可能是，你跟孩子互动当中，怎么去定义补课这件事，这是很关键的。我能感受到家长的焦虑和纠结，我没办法改变客观的环境，但对他比较有用和贴切的回答，是怎么去定义、陈述、对待这件事。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们可能需要区分一下思维和思想。思维是推论性的，要求逻辑的严密；思考是发散、多维的。这样的对话就让我从单向的思维向比较丰富的、对感受更敏感的思考转变。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;那你参加的学术性的工作坊有什么不同？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;项飙：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;那种工作坊都是要用非常清晰的语词去表达，把生活理论化、概念化地去讲，时间一般不会超过三天。这个“看见最初500米”完全不一样，它是开放的，没有一个固定的主题，而且是反对概念化的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;很多年轻人喜欢和你交流，而且很信赖你。你觉得自己是年轻人的导师吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;项飙：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;这次回国我还蛮惊讶的，发现我比自己想象得要更受欢迎一点，年轻人的热切程度超出了我的想象。但是我并没有年轻人的导师的感觉。我很反感导师这样的角色，我自己作为青年人的时候，就不太去理人生导师，所以我不会变成自己讨厌的角色。我是一个对话者。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我觉得最重要的不是我告诉你应该怎么样，而是我激励你去更多地思考。我会提出一些问题，凸显一些悖论，做一些分析，促使你去思考，让我们发现原来的思考可能有些简单，这是我的工作。即使我有一些所谓建议，也是关于怎么去思考，而不是在道德上和行为上应该怎么样。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;但确实很多年轻人向你提问的时候，会问关于焦虑、内卷这些问题，有一种期待你做人生导师的感觉。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;项飙：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我不这么看。他们在朋友聚会也会互相问这些问题的，会说内卷“卷”成这样了，我该怎么办？这些问题不仅朋友间会问，亲戚间会问，晚上睡不着觉的时候也会问自己。我觉得可能那个问题占据了他的脑子，会自然地出来，所以他会向所有人问那个问题。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有趣的是，我怎么去接这样的问题。他知道我不会给他一个答案，不能为他引一条路。大多数人不会这么想。他其实问的是，一个已知无解的问题，应该怎么去面对。所以我把自己放在他那个情况下，理解他的处境，带着真诚去回应，这可能是比较有效的。这完全就是朋友式的交流，不是导师和被指导的关系。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;《把自己作为方法》这本书很畅销，这可能也是年轻人从你这里受到启发的原因。作为一个人类学家，为什么近几年来你会比较乐意接受访谈，或者在大众媒体上出场？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;项飙：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;19、20世纪，社会科学刚刚出现的时候，世界跟今天很不一样，当时学者与非学者的区别在当时非常大。比如欧洲的一个学者，要学习古希腊文、拉丁文、各种哲学，中国的学者梁启超、严复这些人首先引进社会科学，大部分民众是目不识丁的。但是21世纪，我们的青年受教育的程度，他的思考和掌握知识的能力、他的信息，跟学者没什么区别。而且我们往往觉得高手在民间，现在B站上的一些东西，其实比很多学院里的学者写得有趣。这就意味着学术研究不能在像19、20世纪那样，从自己的学术命题出发，写篇文章两三百人看一下，公众不知道怎么回事，那不行。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以我在德国的工作，就是要倡导一种新的研究风格，不是从学术命题出发，而是从公众的焦虑本身出发，把“焦虑”作为题目，来共同研究。或者说，是对话式研究。每个人有自己的生命、自己的挣扎，它里面的味道，和我们在外面猜猜看看不一样。我们的输出应该是如何应对这个世界，给出思考的方法、概念和理论的视角，引起更多的讨论。对于对话式研究来说，在公众媒体上交流就非常重要，这是我的工作方法，不是辅助性，而是根本性的工作方法。不是我有什么结论要告诉大家，而是在不断的往复中，碰撞和深化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;这种对话、往复中，你收到过什么形式的反馈？毕竟你也没在B站开账号，反馈不是用弹幕给出来的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;项飙：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我发现当代艺术特别敏感，2020年国内有四个展览以“附近”为题目。其实“附近”从学理上讲，是个很含糊的东西，我原来自己也没有觉得很有趣，只是一般性地提一下。 “附近”这个概念收到的是热情的反馈。我提出“乡绅”这个说法，收到的反馈就没那么热情，更多是疑问和批判性的。还有些话题我觉得有趣，但公众的反应一般。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有人会在网上找到我的Email给我写信。并不是他提出的问题本身有什么意思，而是我会去思考，他为什么提出这样的问题，我就知道有些问题是具有普遍性的，我还要经过一段时间去观察。所以反馈不是直接给我的，需要一个过程。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;共同的焦虑与16型人格&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;回国这段时间，你几乎每天在高强度地跟各种人聊天，你一直这么健谈吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;项飙：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;没有测过。我不是一个性格上很外向的人，有时候有一点社恐，很长时间对人的主观情感都不敏感。甚至我一直觉得自己有轻度的自闭症，我看牛津的一个分析哲学家的传记，他经常跟别人说话，但是大家发现，他对很多常识性的东西是无感的，对人际关系的理解非常简单，但对有些东西的分析又可以非常深刻，我觉得这好像跟我很像。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;老实说我是比较内向的，比较怕和很多以一起吃饭。那种场合的聊天，很少有人能够完整地讲他的经历，谈话的内容很容易变成各种片段、八卦、极端的故事，很多是道听途说的。我惊讶的是很多知识精英也爱讲这些。在那种环境下，我就很难维持自己，变得非常安静，想快点结束。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;现在中国年轻人很流行聊16型人格，大家经常互相问“你是I人还是E人”，你怎么看这个现象？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;项飙：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;人格分类是个很有趣的现象，它跟年轻人原来对心理学的好奇还不太一样，不仅仅是想了解自己的心理状态，认识自我，它现在主要是一种社交工具，互相知道对方的类型，然后互相画像，然后互相提问，但这个提问其实不一定是说要（根据对方的人格类型）对症下药，而是说没办法用一种自然的话语开始沟通，用人格分类就可以比较安心地去聊。这和社交媒体的作用很有关系，我们习惯与人设，也就是类型的人、画像中的人互动，但是不太知道怎么和人本身互动。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;现在大多数学术研究是围绕着课题走，你用这样的方式来进行对话，研究共同的焦虑，你觉得自己是一个幸运的人吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;项飙：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我是非常幸运，我在牛津本来就很幸运的，到了德国马普所，对我的约束就更少，而且给了一个平台，鼓励你做一些奇怪的事情。在“共同的焦虑”这个方向，我们有博士后在非洲做“压力”，有人在拉美做“执著”，在什么样的具体生活情况下，人们会对什么问题，以什么方式做执著的投入，这可以让我们学到什么。这跟哲学讨论不一样，是很现实的观察。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;为什么你会特别重视“焦虑”？为什么会从“共同的焦虑”，而不是比如说“共同的关切”出发，来进行对话式研究？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;项飙：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;公众关切的东西往往是受一种主流话语形塑的，容易用一些数据直接去表达。关切是一体化、概念化的。焦虑带着情绪性，更接近生命体验本身。对老百姓来说，生活的目的不是批判，而是生活得更好。当然有很多东西值得批判，但要从他生活的目的里面出来，批判才会落到实处，便于他们的行动，然后可以在看起来不可改变的结构之下改变生活，改变人们的思考。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;研究焦虑，要比研究公众的关切，或者某一个议题，难得多得多，因为焦虑这个东西很模糊，讲不清楚，没法定义，更不用说定量了。这就意味着我们必须找到新的语言、新的思想方法。跟着议题走很容易，但创新也很难。但是从焦虑出发，就更能抓住当下的新的矛盾。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;“焦虑”是近几年持续很久的一个热词，对大家焦虑的状况，你有什么观察？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;项飙：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;焦虑的状况比我想象得还要严重，很弥漫性的。本来从报道上就能看到现在心理疾病的高发，然后通过跟年轻人的对话，与各种各样的人聊天、接触，我就更加从经验层面看到大家怎么去描述焦虑，焦虑是如何蔓延的，包括亲密关系当中，焦虑被放大或被扭曲。同时，大家意识到自己在焦虑，这就意味着大家在期待一种改变，至少期待一种更好的回应自己处境的方式。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;焦虑的一个原因是我们对生活的感知的断裂。当生活出现了极大的摇摆，摇摆之后如果没有充分的讨论和沟通，那对老百姓来讲，就没法对事情的发展形成完整的理解。这里面肯定有各种各样的创伤，这个创伤留在自己身上，我们如果处理不好，它会一直留下来，变成我们今后的恐惧、无力、神经过敏、激烈的反应等等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经常有人问我，你为什么不批判？其实批判还是很重要，但我把更多的注意力放在分析我们身上的创伤，我们怎么对待它，怎么去保存自己的力量。 &lt;/p>;

Yang Huiyan, the &quot;tenth consecutive winner&quot; as the richest woman, dropped to fifth place; nearly 60 of the 50 female entrepreneurs on the list started from scratch, and real estate is still their largest source of wealth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 14, Hurun Research Institute and the Business Women&#39;s Growth and Social Platform Hong Kong Beauty Club jointly released the &quot;2023 Hong Kong Beauty Club·Hurun Women Entrepreneurs List&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Hurun Women Entrepreneurs List&quot;) as shown above information. This is the eighteenth consecutive time that Hurun Research Institute has released this list, and the deadline for wealth calculation is September 1, 2023. Unlike the Hurun Rich List, the list of female entrepreneurs separately calculates the personal wealth of female entrepreneurs that can be separated from family wealth. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;94-year-old &quot;No. 1 Tenant&quot; Kuang Xiaoqing became the richest woman in China&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &quot;In the past 18 years, the threshold for the top 50 Chinese female entrepreneurs has increased from 500 million to 13.5 billion , increased nearly 30 times.&quot; Hurun Report, chairman and chief research officer of Hurun Report, said above. However, judging from the Hurun Report&#39;s overall list, the proportion of female entrepreneurs dropped by 1.3 percentage points to 25.4%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Hurun Women Entrepreneurs List shows that 94-year-old Kuang Xiaoqing became the richest woman in China for the first time with a wealth of 72 billion yuan. She is also the sixth richest woman in China in the past 18 years on the Hurun Women Entrepreneurs List. The top five are Zhang Yin (three times) ), Yang Huiyan (ten times), Wu Yajun (twice), Zhou Qunfei (once), Chen Lihua (once). Wu Yajun, the founder of Longfor Real Estate, remains the richest self-made woman in China with 66.5 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/3eaa8871e004d592302015eeabe4487e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;401&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/3eaa8871e004d592302015eeabe4487e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258386&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;(Hurun Female Entrepreneurs List TOP10, Source: Hurun Report)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public information shows that Kuang Xiaoqingsheng Born in Huashan Town, Huadu District, Guangdong Province in 1929, she is the wife of Hong Kong entrepreneur and founder of Sun Hung Kai Properties, Kwok Desheng, with a total wealth of 72 billion yuan. She is also the largest shareholder of Sun Hung Kai Properties. She is highly respected in the family and is the soul of Sun Hung Kai Properties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Hung Kai Properties is one of the largest real estate developers in Hong Kong. According to data from Sun Hung Kai Properties in fiscal year 2023 (July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023), the company’s operating income was HK$71.2 billion. Net profit attributable to the parent company was HK$23.91 billion, with a net profit margin of 34.52%, a year-on-year increase of 2.7%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kuang Xiaoqing is known as &quot;China&#39;s No. 1 Housekeeper&quot;. Judging from the financial reports of Sun Hung Kai Properties in the past five years, property rental has always contributed the largest proportion of revenue, about one-third. Judging from the latest financial report, as of June 30, 2023, Sun Hung Kai Properties&#39; land bank in Hong Kong is approximately 58 million square feet (approximately 5.38 million square meters), of which more than 60% are diversified properties, most of which are used for Leasing and long-term investment bring considerable recurring income to the group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Hurun Report, Kuang Xiaoqing became the richest woman in China for the first time, mainly benefiting from the rise in the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate this year and company dividends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the rise in the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, since the beginning of this year, the RMB exchange rate against the Hong Kong dollar has risen from around 0.8 to around 0.9, with a maximum of around 0.93. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the company&#39;s dividends, Flush shows that Sun Hung Kai Properties is one of the blue-chip stocks that have been purchased the most by domestic investors, with a cumulative cash distribution of HK$71.72 billion in the past five years. In fiscal year 2023 (July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023), the company will distribute cash twice, with an amount of HK$14.34 billion, and a dividend payout ratio of 60%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that in the latest fiscal year (dividend payment date is November 16), Sun Hung Kai Properties paid a dividend of HK$3.7 per share, which was three times the dividend of the previous fiscal year. Kwong Xiaoqing personally holds less than 0.01% of Sun Hung Kai Properties, which is 25,020 shares. Kwong Xiaoqing and his immediate family members jointly hold 19.5% of Sun Hung Kai Properties&#39; shares, totaling 565 million shares. Based on a dividend payout of HK$3.7 per share, Kuang Xiaoqing’s personal shareholding and the shareholding jointly held with others will make a profit of approximately HK$2.091 billion. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The ranking of &quot;Ten Crowns&quot; Yang Huiyan dropped to fifth place&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In this list, another major focus is the substantial wealth of Yang Huiyan, who has won the title of the richest woman ten times. Shrunk, ranking fell to fifth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the changes in the Hurun Women Entrepreneurs list, Country Garden Chairman and Executive Director Yang Huiyan’s wealth has shrunk the most in 2023 compared to last year (27 billion yuan), ranking 5th with 48 billion yuan; followed by It is Cheng Xue, CEO of Haitian Flavor Industry, whose performance has declined due to the additive incident, and his wealth has shrunk by 16.5 billion yuan; and Zhao Yan, chairman of Bloomage International Investment Group, the &quot;Queen of Hyaluronic Acid&quot;, whose wealth has shrunk by 14.5 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Born in 1981, Yang Huiyan is the second daughter of Country Garden founder Yang Guoqiang. In 2005, Yang Huiyan returned to China after graduating from the Ohio State University majoring in marketing and logistics, and joined Country Garden as Yang Guoqiang&#39;s personal assistant and served as purchasing manager. She has held important positions in Country Garden Investment Center, Procurement Department, Human Resources Center, Digital Management Center and other departments. In March 2023, Yang Huiyan officially became the successor of the family business and served as the chairman of the board of directors of Country Garden. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2007, Country Garden was listed in Hong Kong, and Yang Guoqiang transferred all his shares to Yang Huiyan. 26-year-old Yang Huiyan topped the 2007 Forbes rich list with $16.02 billion, and became China&#39;s new richest woman. In the 16 years from 2007 to 2022, Yang Huiyan aspired to be the richest woman in China ten times. It is worth noting that Yang Huiyan’s wealth has shrunk by nearly 60% year-on-year in 2022, but she still ranks first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/e2b3c063491daeb6cf2b77ab07539ef4.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;577&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/e2b3c063491daeb6cf2b77ab07539ef4.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258388&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;(Yang Huiyan aspired to be the richest woman in China ten times, source: Hurun Report)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Huiyan’s wealth has shrunk and Country Garden Crisis is closely related. In 2023, due to increasing uncertainty in the macro economy and real estate, Country Garden&#39;s debt has frequently shown red lights. &quot;Faced with the two-way tightening on the consumer side and the financing side, the group&#39;s liquidity is under unprecedented pressure.&quot; Country Garden said in its 2023 mid-term report. From Country Garden&#39;s annual and interim reports for the past five years, we can find that Country Garden&#39;s strategic goals have changed from prudent and pragmatic replenishment of high-quality land reserves to &quot;guaranteing the delivery of buildings&quot; and making every effort to arrange debt repayments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 30, 2023, Country Garden Services (6098.HK) announced that Yang Huiyan, the company’s controlling shareholder, non-executive director and chairman of the board of directors, donated RMB 64 million to Guoqiang Charity Foundation (Hong Kong) Co., Ltd. HK$100 million worth of stocks will be used for charity. But this move caused controversy in the market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the Hurun Women Entrepreneurs List shows that the number of new female billionaires on the list is 8, which is the lowest in 18 years and 3 less than last year. Among the newcomers, the top one is Zhou Chaonan of Runze Technology, which is engaged in the big data center and computing infrastructure industry, with a wealth of 20 billion yuan; followed by Shu Ping, one of the founders of Haidilao, with a wealth of 18 billion yuan; and then Yulon of Taiwan. Car boss Yan Chen Lillian has a fortune of 16 billion yuan. Newcomers also include Ye Qiongjiu, director and deputy general manager of Tonghuashun, with a wealth of 13.5 billion yuan. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Nearly 60% of female entrepreneurs started from scratch. Real estate is still the largest source of wealth&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of wealth sources, nearly 60% of female entrepreneurs started from scratch, and nearly 40% inherited it. . &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Specifically, the Hurun Female Entrepreneurs List shows that there are 34 self-made female entrepreneurs in 2023, accounting for 59%, which is basically the same as last year; 24 are not self-made, 2 fewer than last year position, accounting for 41%, compared with 43% last year. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Self-made female entrepreneurs mainly start their own businesses or start businesses with their husbands.

He is a capable person, with great strength and a sharp mind. He can handle all kinds of farm work with ease. He can adapt immediately to work in the city. From skills to interpersonal skills, he can handle it with ease, making money and gaining popularity. Therefore, his family has the most prosperous life in the village and can be called the &quot;richest man&quot;. He is a person who &quot;stamps his feet in the east of the village and trembles in the west of the village&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He often said that he had not studied for a few days and had not received any advanced education, but his life was better than others. Go to school and study, and ultimately you have to live a good life. As long as you live a good life, don&#39;t care too much whether you get an education or not. Therefore, when other families were worried about their children&#39;s poor grades, the third uncle was very indifferent and didn&#39;t care about his cousin&#39;s grades. He didn&#39;t praise his cousin if he got 100 points in the exam, and he didn&#39;t beat or scold him if he failed. He told his son, How many points you earn is not a matter of ability, the key is being able to make money. Uncle San has this attitude towards school education and instills this into family education - as long as you master the ability to make money, you will win. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My third uncle is very disdainful of those families that invest too much money and energy in education, especially my family. Although the tuition fees at that time were not high, they were still a big burden for rural families. Before the start of each school year, many parents were worried about the tuition fees, and it would even take a long time after the school started to raise the funds. Uncle San didn’t understand the idea of ​​collecting tuition fees. Since he had no money, why would he still go to school? He went to elementary school, middle school, and university. After graduation, if he didn’t find a job or the job was not good, he would have to invest more than ten dollars. Wasn’t the money spent in the year wasted? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, I performed abnormally in the high school entrance examination and felt that I could not reach the admission score. I was very depressed and lost. My relatives and friends could not come to comfort me. Only my third uncle came over and told me, don’t worry. In the worst case, I would learn to repair cars with him. Studying is easy and you can make money. It made me dumbfounded. Fortunately, it was just a false alarm. A month later, I successfully entered high school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to differences in educational concepts, the relationship between father and third uncle is very delicate. The two brothers often quarrel over this difference when eating and drinking, and break up on bad terms. My father was firm at first and kept encouraging me, saying that I should study even though I was selling everything. But as his cousin entered the society, his father&#39;s heart was shaken. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the neglect of his third uncle, his cousin barely survived until he graduated from junior high school. Then he refused to go to school and wanted to go out to the city to try his luck. The third uncle expressed his support and entrusted him to a do-it-yourselfer. Relatives take care of business. The third uncle gave his cousin a sum of money and asked him to make the first pot of gold by himself. My cousin is not very old, but he has inherited the talents of his third uncle. Before he was 18 years old, he was already prosperous in the city, and at least he started taking money from the family. And I was still &quot;burning money&quot; in college at that time. Every time I came home for vacation, my father would always talk about the legend of my cousin getting rich, and his tone was full of admiration. Later, he gradually expressed his blame for my slow success in studying, from sighing to complaining, which made me afraid to appear at the same time as my cousin. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reversal occurred in my second year on the job. My cousin started to get into debt. He liked to make rapid progress in business. In addition, he entered the society at an early age and gained stubborn self-confidence. He turned a deaf ear to the old man&#39;s advice. Moving money here and there and negotiating in the west have become the norm, and we are gradually unable to make ends meet. At first, the third uncle felt that the family was rich and the loss was nothing. But when he realized that something was wrong, it was too late. The cousin’s debts spanned both black and white, including relatives and friends. He was unable to repay them, so he owed it to the stronger third uncle. On the head. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After going bankrupt, only one-tenth of the debt was paid. The third uncle, who has become a grandfather and enjoys his old age, decided to start over. He took up the craftsmanship of his youth and worked two or three jobs at the same time. He works hard and makes money to pay off his debts with amazing perseverance. Relatives&#39; debts, bank loans... one after another, all relied on him and his third aunt to support the repayment. The cousin, who was used to wallowing in money, couldn&#39;t accept the life without money. He just settled down after falling into debt. His parents had to bear the huge burden. Even his own son was taken care of by an old man while working. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This has been going on for ten years, and the debt has finally been repaid. I haven&#39;t changed much, I just keep going to and from get off work. The ones who have changed are my father and my third uncle. My father began to be grateful for his investment in education. Although I did not earn much money, I learned to be steady and not easy to &quot;learn bad things&quot;, and he believed in me more than before. The third uncle began to repeat, &quot;How good it is to study.&quot; Education costs money, but the money is worth spending, because those who study have a &quot;doorkeeper&quot; and something to pull them when doing things, and they will not keep &quot;stepping on the accelerator&quot;. &quot;, no matter what. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later I gradually understood that although education is not a panacea, it may not be able to directly solve very real problems such as employment and making money. But nothing is possible without education. We often think of education and society as a cause-and-effect relationship. Education must be responsible for what we can do when we enter society, otherwise it will be useless. In fact, a major function of education is to be responsible for what you do not do when you enter society. You should not just focus on &quot;doing something&quot;, but also pay attention to &quot;doing something not to do.&quot; Through the words of the third uncle, I think that regardless of family education, school education, or social education, if you focus on using education as the &quot;gas pedal&quot; for profit, you will definitely lose control. In an increasingly &quot;fast&quot; era, education is needed as the &quot;brake&quot; role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a Changchun media person)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;span>; 163.com)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 15 Nov 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[千年造像被“毁容”，只为他们还个愿？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260666]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-15 16:29:19&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;Recently, a cliff was excavated in Nanjiang County, Bazhong, Sichuan more than 1,400 years ago in the late Northern Wei Dynasty.

In February 2022, the Bazhong Municipal Cultural Relics Bureau, the School of Archeology and Museum of Sichuan University, the Xi&#39;an Forest of Steles Museum and the Nanjiang County Cultural Relics Protection Research Center jointly conducted an investigation of the cliff statues. The subsequent report concluded that:&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>; &quot;Cliff statues were rarely excavated in the late Northern Wei Dynasty, and were continued in the early Tang &lt;span>;, Wu Zhou and middle and late Tang dynasties. The excavation date was early and the formation process was complicated. The entire natural stone package on the ground was excavated into a stele for the statue. The characteristic practice is an isolated example in Sichuan.
