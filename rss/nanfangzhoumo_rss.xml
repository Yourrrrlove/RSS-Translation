On June 18, he was murdered outside a Sikh cultural center in British Columbia, Canada. The case triggered strong protests from the Canadian Sikh community, demanding that the Canadian government solve the case as soon as possible and bring the murderer to justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 18, Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau mentioned the matter when speaking in the House of Commons, saying that he had obtained &quot;credible&quot; evidence that the Indian government was involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;India and Canada are far apart. Why does a case that happened thousands of miles away involve the Indian government? Why did the latter react so violently? This is related to the &quot;Khalistan&quot; (that is, the Sikh independence movement) movement in India. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to solve the issue of the status of the Sikhs has always been a family scandal that successive Indian governments have tried hard to cover up. The incident of India and Canada expelling diplomats from each other has once again attracted widespread attention from the international community. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Are you no longer afraid of exposing family scandals&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Successive Indian governments have always been highly vigilant about the return of the &quot;Khalistan&quot; movement. When the governments of countries where overseas Sikhs live show support and condone behavior, India will use various channels to implement measures. pressure, but generally adhere to the principle of low-key handling in order to minimize the opportunity for the &quot;Khalistan&quot; movement to express its claims. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After taking office, the Modi government has shown new thinking on ethnic issues, and its domestic and foreign policies and statements have become increasingly stronger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Domestically, the Modi government’s economic and social development policies continue to sacrifice the well-being of India’s minority groups. Violent incidents against ethnic minorities by Hindu extremist organizations occur from time to time, and the economic and social conditions of the Sikhs in India are deteriorating day by day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Abroad, Modi insists on exporting Hindu nationalist ideas among overseas Indians. Whenever he visits foreign countries, he will use Hindu elements to hold large gatherings to build support for the cause of Hindu nationalism among overseas Hindus. . The Modi government&#39;s ethnic policies have successfully brought sharply antagonistic ethnic relations at home to Indian groups overseas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2002, Modi was serving as Chief Minister of Gujarat. The state government led by him was accused of adopting a policy of inaction in response to riots and even condoning attacks, resulting in thousands of casualties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After taking office as Prime Minister of India, Modi took a very strong position on the issue of overseas Sikhs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first is to increase pressure on host governments and require these countries to take practical measures to combat so-called anti-India activities in their own countries. Senior Indian officials have repeatedly accused the United States and Europe of using the &quot;Khalistan&quot; movement to involve issues of Indian sovereignty in public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is to support overseas Hindus and rush to the forefront of opposing overseas Sikhs. Overseas, when Sikh demonstrations occur, overseas Hindus are often arranged to hold tit-for-tat activities at the same time. People from both sides exchanged insults, and overseas Hindus and overseas Sikhs even caused conflicts in the streets, forcing the host government to intervene by creating social security incidents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the United States has deepened its reliance on India, European and American countries have been less concerned about issues such as the status of the Sikhs for some time. The Modi government has emphasized its strong strategy to deal with overseas Sikh issues. It seems to be quite effective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the Russia-Ukraine conflict, India has not followed the United States and Europe in imposing comprehensive sanctions on Russia. Disappointed, the United States and Europe will no longer tolerate concessions to India&#39;s actions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, the intention of the United States and Europe to use the status of the Sikhs to attack India has become increasingly obvious. The United States took the lead in attacking India. For example, in May 2022, the state of Connecticut passed a resolution declaring that April 29 was recognized as the &quot;Sikh Declaration of Independence Day.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As we enter 2023, &quot;Khalistan&quot; gatherings have occurred one after another in the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom, and activists have also had violent clashes with local Indians. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Canada, anti-India demonstrations have also occurred frequently since 2023, and India-Canada relations have continued to be tense. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Confrontation&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Canada has expressed its views on the Sikh issue from time to time. India has always been quite dissatisfied and regards Canada as the overseas base camp of the &quot;Khalistan&quot; movement. one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, the number of Sikhs in Canada is about 770,000, accounting for about 2.21% of Canada’s total population, which is equivalent to the proportion of Sikhs in India’s total population. Sikhs generally develop well in Canada, have higher economic and social status, and have greater political influence in the local area. For example, when Trudeau became Prime Minister of Canada in 2015, his cabinet included four Sikh ministerial officials. Sikhs also have a relatively high representation rate in Canadian parliaments at all levels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Modi first took office as Prime Minister of India, he had quarrels with Canada over the Sikh issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2015, when Modi paid his first state visit to Canada, India attached great importance to it. However, some organizations in Canada immediately held protests and marches, demanding that the Canadian government investigate Modi’s 2002 murder in Gujarat. A high-profile state visit was tarnished by his dereliction of duty amid ethnic riots. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the United States and Europe begin to revisit this disagreement, India and Canada have had many confrontations over the Sikh issue, adding uncertainties to the already troubled bilateral relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Canada, two incidents occurred in June 2023, exacerbating tensions between the two sides. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, on June 4, the Sikhs held a parade to protest against the &quot;Operation Blue Star&quot; launched by the Indian government that year, and used a float parade to recreate the scene of Indira Gandhi&#39;s assassination. . The Indian government protests that Canada has violated its sovereignty and dignity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then on June 18, Nijar, the famous leader of Canada’s “Khalistan Independence Referendum”, was shot dead by two gunmen in the street. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if Canada&#39;s concerns about the Sikhs in India are not taken into account, the Indian government&#39;s involvement in the assassination of a Canadian citizen has involved Canadian sovereignty and is a serious criminal case. This can be said to have touched the bottom line of the Canadian government. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the G20 summit in early September, the host Modi did not hold a one-on-one meeting with Trudeau. Instead, he expressed &quot;strong concern&quot; about &quot;Canadian extremists&#39; continued anti-India activities&quot;, which triggered strong opposition from Canada. dissatisfied. Then came Trudeau’s latest briefing on the Nijar incident mentioned above, emphasizing that he had obtained “credible” evidence and that the Modi government could not escape its involvement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;India and Canada not only expelled diplomats from each other, but also interrupted negotiations on a free trade agreement. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The Sikh Question&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;,&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;India’s&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Thunder&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;India&#39;s &quot;dissension&quot; on the Sikh issue has a lot to do with the historical grievances of ethnic conflicts in India that led to the emigration of Sikhs overseas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the latest census by the Population Registration and Survey Commission of India, there are about 20 million Sikhs, accounting for about 2% of the total Hindu population. The Indian state of Punjab has one of the largest concentrations of Sikhs. Punjab has a total population of 27.7 million, of which 57.69%, or about 16 million, believe in Sikhism. In Punjab, the Sikhs are the majority ethnic group. From a nationwide perspective in India, the Sikhs are an absolute minority. This situation has created a unique political status for the Sikhs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sikhism originated in India in the 15th century. The founder, Guru Nanak, opposed the caste oppression of Hinduism and put forward the slogan of &quot;everyone is equal and treats others equally&quot;. The Sikh ethnic group has strong internal cohesion and a martial ethos. They are hard-working and hard-working, and have a high economic and social status in India. However, the political status of the Sikhs is one of India&#39;s most sensitive internal affairs issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since India’s independence, the Sikhs have always hoped to gain more autonomy under the Indian federal system. The decentralization movements carried out at different times have also achieved certain results, including the original Punjab state being divided into two parts in 1966. Second, this made the Sikhs the majority ethnic group in a local state for the first time in history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the late 1970s, the Sikhs in Punjab, India once again launched a non-violent regional autonomy movement, but the Indian government took strong measures to suppress it, especially the &quot;Blue Massacre&quot; on June 3, 1984. &quot;Operation Star&quot; had the greatest impact. At that time, the Indian armed forces used heavy equipment including tanks, artillery and helicopters to attack the Golden Temple in Amritsar where militants were entrenched, causing huge casualties and damaging the sacred Golden Temple building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Sikhs compared &quot;Operation Blue Star&quot; with the foreign invasions and massacres they encountered in history, which aroused the sentiments of the Sikhs at home and abroad with the same hatred. Sikh soldiers mutinied in many places in India. . &quot;Operation Blue Star&quot; caused serious antagonism between Sikhs and Hindus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As one of the acts of retaliation, on October 31, 1984, the then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards. Indira&#39;s assassination triggered a mass crisis in India. A wide range of Hindu attacks on Sikhs killed at least 3,000 Sikhs. Since then, the relationship between the two ethnic groups has become completely antagonistic, and the incident has gradually evolved into an armed separatist rebellion by the Sikhs fighting for independence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By 1993, the &quot;Khalistan Movement&quot; rebellion was considered largely quelled, causing a total of 21,443 deaths during this period, including 11,694 civilians, 1,746 armed forces soldiers, and 8,003 militants . Since then, many Sikhs have emigrated overseas, mainly to the United States, Canada, Britain, Australia and other countries. Today, about 1.5 million Sikhs live outside India and have become an important part of overseas Indians. However, the Indian government offended the memory of the Shwedagon Temple and the large-scale pursuit and killing of Sikh people in &quot;Operation Blue Star&quot; , continues to exist among Sikhs overseas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of now, the incident is still unfolding, and the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom have all expressed serious concerns. It is still unclear whether India is certain that Trudeau will not disclose key evidence in the case, or whether Trudeau has produced evidence to pin Modi on the pillar of shame for continuing to persecute the Sikhs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the most injured person in the whole incident was the third party, the United States. The Biden administration in the United States has made great efforts in recent years to build the so-called alliance of democracies. Whether it is the four-nation grouping of the United States, Japan, India, and Australia, or the &quot;Five Eyes&quot; alliance of the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, the two parties involved in the incident are important members. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that the Democratic Alliance has not yet been established and cracks are appearing, will the United States, as the leader of the alliance, personally mediate? How effective can mediation be? We&#39;ll see. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is an associate researcher at the South Asia Research Center of Fudan University)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 23 Sep 2023 11:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[教育部：对“预制菜进校园”持审慎态度]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257458]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-23 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, the topic of &quot;prepared dishes entering campus&quot; in some places has attracted widespread attention from society. Recently, reporters interviewed the heads of relevant departments and bureaus of the Ministry of Education regarding &quot;prepared dishes entering campuses.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the person in charge, school food safety and nutritional health are related to the healthy growth of students. The Ministry of Education has long been working with relevant departments to effectively implement the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and strictly implement the Food Safety Law and other laws regulations, and has successively formulated and implemented regulations such as the &quot;Regulations on the Management of Food Safety and Nutrition and Health in Schools&quot; and the &quot;Guidelines for the Construction of Nutrition and Healthy Schools&quot; to continuously strengthen the management of school food safety and nutrition and health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 57 of the Food Safety Law stipulates that canteens of schools and other centralized dining units must strictly abide by laws, regulations and food safety standards; those who order food from catering units must obtain food production and operation licenses from The enterprise orders and inspects the ordered food as required. Catering units should strictly abide by laws, regulations and food safety standards when processing meals to ensure food safety. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person in charge pointed out that the party and the government attach great importance to school food safety and are very concerned about the healthy growth of students. Parents expect their children to eat green, safe, nutritious and healthy food in school. After research, given that there is currently no unified standard system, certification system, traceability system and other effective regulatory mechanisms for prepared dishes, a very cautious attitude should be taken when &quot;prepared dishes are brought to campus&quot; and it is not appropriate to promote them into campuses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 23 Sep 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[成为全职儿女，是双向奔赴还是逃离社会？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257415]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-23 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/20/1JE8T6YwMwSf39ignBvAWz6wqusEAeMivHPOMl8t.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;930&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/1JE8T6YwMwSf39ignBvAWz6wqusEAeMivHP OMl8t. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251338&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Chen Zhitong/Picture)&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most effortless social identity a person can acquire from birth is &quot;son or daughter&quot;. As life progresses, a variety of new social identities will be acquired, including occupations, titles, Relationships, political identities, and more. When a person interrupts the process, deviates from the life trajectory preset by mainstream concepts, and retreats from society to the family, what words can he use to define himself? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1980s, British society classified people who were not employed, enrolled in higher education, or furthered as NEET (Not in Employment, Education or Training). This term was adopted when it was introduced to Japan and Taiwan. The transliteration of &quot;Nite tribe&quot; is translated as &quot;gnawing old tribe&quot; in mainland China. But the &quot;elder-gnawing behavior&quot; is not limited to &quot;elder-gnawers.&quot; According to a China Family Tracking Survey by Peking University, the proportion of &quot;elder-gnawers&quot; among my country&#39;s working-age population jumped from less than 2% in 2010 to 40% in 2018. %above. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japanese scholar Yamada Hiromasa proposed the term &quot;single parasites&quot; in 1999, which is more specific than NEET. It refers to those who have been delaying marriage and rely on their parents for daily life such as housing and food. People who use their income as &quot;pocket money&quot;. The male protagonist of the Japanese drama &quot;My Story is a Long Story&quot; is a &quot;single parasite&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether it is &quot;gnawing at the old&quot; or &quot;single parasitism&quot;, the words themselves have a certain derogatory color, and are only measured by social value. In the context of unavoidable stigma, some people who have returned to their families choose to define themselves as &quot;full-time children&quot;. Apart from all external social identities, they are at least the children of their parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having full-time children is not a large number, nor is it an option that can be easily replicated, but it has caused a huge amount of discussion on the Internet. Rather than what a full-time son or daughter is or how to be a full-time son or daughter, we are more concerned about why they give up other identities. The reason why they have become full-time children is not only due to themselves, but also has a lot to do with the common difficulties they face in this era, but they have not been able to overcome it for the time being, or have given up the fight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/jv6s6VVx0pKS8P6lINgiWhE5nOKQqLExILl63Ng2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;679&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/jv6s6VVx0pKS8P6lINgiWhE5nOKQqLExILl63Ng2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251336&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Chen Zhitong/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Single sojourn&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In The popularity of exchanges in the Douban group &quot;Exchange Center for Full-time Children&#39;s Work&quot; has subsided. Old posts from the past are constantly being dug up by students and reporters in journalism and sociology, showing a strong sense of exploration into &quot;full-time children&quot;. Such inquiries sometimes arouse resentment. Some people couldn&#39;t help but post and ask, &quot;Why are people suddenly paying attention to full-time children?&quot; Most of the people who responded thought it was hype and hot-button pursuit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most active period of the group is from January to April 2023. Many people who choose to describe themselves as &quot;full-time children&quot; share their stories publicly. In these stories, happiness and relaxation are rare, and anxiety and confusion are the main themes: &quot;I feel that my sense of worth is very low&quot; &quot;I am especially tired when facing relatives, and my parents sometimes show dissatisfaction&quot; &quot;I have already started to feel anxious in the third week&quot; &quot;...Some people also mentioned that some people who become full-time children are under peer pressure and are easily traumatized - they are out of touch with the mainstream development path of society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The definition of full-time children in the group introduction is somewhat similar to the &quot;single parasitic family&quot;: single young people, living in their parents&#39; homes and enjoying financial assistance from their parents. The difference is that full-time children will work hard in exchange for financial assistance, and they do not give up employment, but keep studying, waiting for opportunities to return to the workplace, or take public postgraduate entrance examinations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This definition is consistent with most full-time children aged 20-30, although it is not applicable to those over 30 years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xixi is 26 years old, and her situation fits the definition of a full-time child. After graduating from an overseas master&#39;s degree in December 2022, she went through various considerations of applying for a doctorate and finding a job, and finally chose to concentrate on preparing for the civil service exam at home. The background of her circle of friends is Russell&#39;s famous saying: &quot;Don&#39;t feel guilty for sleeping in, because you can&#39;t create much value when you get up.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xixi believes that major has the greatest influence on her career choice. She majored in education. “Two of my classmates from the same school who studied accounting and marketing quickly joined the workforce. One joined PricewaterhouseCoopers and the other joined Mercedes-Benz. But these big companies don’t require education. student.&quot; Her original career plan was to enter a university after completing her Ph.D., but during the four months of applying in 2022, she felt tremendous pressure. Being infected with the new crown epidemic in December was the last straw that crushed her. The application was abandoned. Later, when she accidentally opened her mailbox, Xixi discovered that she had received an offer from the University of Birmingham in the UK, but by that time she had missed the deadline to apply for a scholarship. &quot;It is too low cost to spend millions to study for a doctorate in liberal arts at your own expense.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;A 985 master&#39;s degree in liberal arts is not as good as a bachelor&#39;s degree in computer science with three majors.&quot; Xixi felt this from the salary. A friend of hers joined an Internet company after graduating with a bachelor&#39;s degree in computer science. After a few years, his annual salary rose to 600,000 yuan. When she was applying for a master&#39;s degree, she briefly found a job with a monthly salary of only 3,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When taking the civil service exam this time, Xixi did not prepare for the exam while working as she did when applying for a master&#39;s degree. She found that the competition is too fierce now, and the number of people taking the civil service exam has increased significantly in recent years. Taking the National Civil Service Examination as an example, since 2021, the number of applicants has increased by about 500,000 every year, reaching 1.51 million in 2021 and exceeding 2.5 million in 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xixi’s parents supported her decision to stay at home and find a job. Her father said to her: “Don’t worry, you can slowly find a job that you are more satisfied with.” One of her classmates was not so lucky. The family&#39;s financial situation is good, but his parents really wanted him to find a job as soon as possible after graduating from the master&#39;s degree. He could only find a job as a counselor in a local technical secondary school in a hurry, with a monthly salary of two to three thousand, and the work was very tiring. “He wanted to take the entrance examination for a certain position, but he had no energy to review after work, so he was caught in a dilemma: he was reluctant to give up his current job because he was afraid that he would not be able to find another job in the future; he was tired, unhappy and had little money if he didn’t give up. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the lessons learned from her classmates, Xixi prepares for the provincial exam with peace of mind at home. Her family&#39;s finances are jointly managed by her parents and her. She can freely use the fraction of her savings, which is enough to cover her living expenses, but she does not have to take on housework. &quot;I mainly want to be a companion.&quot; After going to college, Xixi rarely grew up like this. Spending time living with her parents, my mother cherishes her days at home. Every night, my parents watch TV in the living room, while Xixi does aerobics. One day when Xixi went to her room to exercise, her mother asked unaccustomedly, &quot;Why don&#39;t you dance outside today?&quot; Push her to work, but she still feels anxious, and she feels like her days at home are getting nowhere. &quot;We are in a result-oriented society. I cannot accept the view that life is not a track but a wilderness. I am still trapped by the mainstream values ​​of society.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Professional Value&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Douban There is a question thread in the group, &quot;Why do children become full-time workers?&quot; Among the 16 answers, the reason &quot;doesn&#39;t want to work/can&#39;t find a job&quot; accounted for 11, including young people who are unemployed after graduation. In 2023, the youth unemployment rate continues to rise. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the national urban survey of the population aged 16-24 years old, the unemployment rate exceeded 20% from April to June 2023. Since August, this data has been suspended release. When some young people who cannot find jobs return to their families, they become full-time children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lan Qi is one of the unemployed youth aged 16-24. She understands that having a full-time job is not a normal way of employment. &quot;I also get a salary at home, but it cannot be compared with going out to work outside. Any kind of job should communicate with the outside world.&quot; Lan Qi was forced to stay at home. She had a job after graduating from undergraduate school, but her father rejected it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;His worries are too conservative. Isn&#39;t it safe for a girl to go on a business trip for a few days? What&#39;s more, there are female colleagues traveling with her. His concept is that after I get married, I will have nothing to do with him. Before, we had to protect our daughter&#39;s reputation. The value of a virgin is better than anything else in her growth.&quot; Lan Qi did not try to persuade her father and resigned and returned home. She was pained by the absurd stubbornness of her parents and her own weakness, and had no courage to find a new job. &quot;I feel like I am useless. I am lagging behind my peers and out of touch with society. I am like Juexin in &quot;Home&quot; and Nora in &quot;A Doll&#39;s House&quot;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In me Among all the stories about stay-at-home children that I have read, Lanqi’s case is very special. I was not sure whether she belonged to this group, but she chose the word herself because she liked the professional attributes in it. &quot;As long as there is labor, it is a career. Some people think that children who work full-time are &#39;cheating on the old&#39;, but I don&#39;t agree. &#39;Cheating on the old&#39; means relying on their parents for food and clothing without putting in any work, which means losing one&#39;s own value. I want to do housework too. Valuable.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lan Qi made me realize that in most descriptions of full-time children, the children should be the dominant one, asking their parents for financial assistance to provide for their own lives, but in fact Parents may also be the ones in control, and their attitudes and concepts shape the appearance of the family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lanqi’s parents believe that doing housework is a better choice for women than working outside the home. Lan Qi said, &quot;They seem to be cultivating a housework machine. They do housework and cook for the future when they get married, and the skills they learn are for future generations. For example, my mother thinks that I learn swimming so that my children can learn it faster. .&quot; One time I was chatting with Lan Qi, and she said that she was cooking dinner that night, and her mother said to her, &quot;You took my place.&quot; She felt very sad, &quot;She could have worked hard in society, but she was doing heavy housework at home. , can the heart be willing and the emotion be willing?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The concept of Lan Qi&#39;s parents comes from their ancestors, &quot;My grandfather &#39;protected&#39; his daughters very well, which was very rare in that era. They had a good reputation and were surrounded by neighbors. Quite recognized.&quot; Lanqi&#39;s parents hope that she will be a daughter who is waiting to be born, and she chooses to be a full-time child. Modern and traditional are integrated in this word, so it is both understandable and novel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/0HS9ni4yQzkUz8L7e5v5VxyjTfDi9SPGBnIha9zC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;679&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/0HS9ni4yQzkUz8L7e5v5VxyjTfDi9SPGBnIha9zC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251335&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Chen Zhitong/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Puppet on a string&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Among the reasons for becoming a full-time child, Yue Hang’s answers left a deep impression on me. She was the first person to accept my request for an interview. Before the interview, I didn’t realize how courageous she was. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yue Hang’s narration drew me to Shenzhen, a hot and humid place with endless summers. In 2017, 25-year-old Yue Hang returned from studying abroad, and her father found her a job in Shenzhen. This job made her unhappy. At the end of 2020, she lost her sense of smell. After that, her skin problems worsened, her acne bleeds, and her attempts to resolve the unpleasantness all failed. In the spring of 2021, the second job her father found brought a turnaround in her life, but she was persuaded to quit after a three-month probation period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Wait while I light a cigarette.&quot; Yue Hang said, but she didn&#39;t take a few puffs in total. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yue Hang’s first job was in a family business. The boss was from Chaoshan, Guangdong. There were less than 10 employees in the office, most of whom were relatives of the boss. Yue Hang couldn&#39;t even understand Chaoshan dialect, and she couldn&#39;t understand it until she left her job. She was like an outsider in the office and could only do things in silence. Salaries have basically never been increased. In 2020, the company&#39;s performance was not good and wages began to be owed. Other non-relative colleagues resigned, but Yue Hang persisted - she also submitted several resumes, but received no response. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This company is not equipped with dormitories. When Yue Hang first arrived, he still had expectations for life. His salary was 5,000 yuan and he spent 3,500 yuan on renting a house. Later, her rental price dropped to 800 yuan. &quot;It&#39;s not a good house. It&#39;s cheap. I don&#39;t want to spend a dime on this job. I also struggled with myself. I endured hardship, but it didn&#39;t work.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2020, the company finally allocated dormitories, and Yue Hang moved in even though there was no air conditioning. She admitted that her mentality at the time was a bit stupid, &quot;Finally, the company provided free housing, and I had to live there to earn back my money.&quot; The highest temperature in Shenzhen in summer can exceed 40 degrees Celsius. Yue Hang was so hot that she was desperate while calculating her profits and losses. Only later did she realize I have suffered a big loss, and my health has been lost. &quot;I hate that company, so I have to recover the psychological gap from the financial aspect. It&#39;s just that I feel it&#39;s unfair to get such a small salary.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second company made Yue Hang feel much better, until his boss He asked her: &quot;What did your parents teach you?&quot; He even criticized her in public and called her father. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the four years of working in Shenzhen, Yue Hang was like a screw in a machine, always tense and unable to relax. The weekly working hours are from Monday to Saturday, with only one day off on Sunday. She will eat a lot of desserts and stuff them into her mouth until she feels like vomiting, just to get a little happiness. Although such happiness was short-lived, she didn&#39;t know where else to find it. When she had insomnia at night, she would masturbate to make herself fall asleep quickly, &quot;I need to have enough sleep to be able to serve my work.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the night when she resigned from the second company, Yue Hang I have been lying in front of my desk, thinking about what happened in the week before leaving my job. Her whole body was frozen in place like a puppet. If she wanted to move, her body could move, but she had no will to drive her body. She fell into stupor for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2021, Yue Hang went out of town to attend a relative’s wedding on behalf of her family—both her parents worked, and she was the only one free. At the wedding, Yue Hang suddenly fell into a coma. Her parents came to take her home and sent her to a psychiatric ward the next day. She became a puppet again, conscious but unable to leave the darkness. She woke up only a few days later. Her depression was already severe. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The overdraft generation&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In November 2021, Yue Hang was discharged from the hospital and began a life of recuperation at home. She almost shuts herself away and rarely communicates with her parents. They would get angry when they saw her sitting on the sofa &quot;doing nothing,&quot; so she always stayed in her room alone. Like a rebound from the regular life of commuting to and from work in the past, her sleeping time has become disorderly, and she will let herself suffer from insomnia. &quot;I just coax myself, not to be anxious, and I don&#39;t have to go to work anyway.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In February 2022, after returning to her hometown as a child, Yue Hang resumed socializing, driving to meet friends, eat delicious food, and visit scenic spots... She likes to travel by car, but she has almost no chance to use a car in the past few years in Shenzhen. Her life includes many activities that were not available during her working life: trying to plant flowers and plants, going to the rooftop to dry clothes in the sunshine, and collecting express cartons to sell scrap products. She likes the process of collecting cartons. She first selects the largest carton, then unpacks and flattens other small cartons to stuff more things into a fixed space. Although the cartons collected for several months can only be sold for ten A few dollars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the small town in his hometown, apart from paying social security, Yue Hang’s other living expenses are about 1,000 yuan. Her parents gave her a living allowance, and she also earned pocket money through part-time work - she worked as a temporary assistant in a photography studio, earning 50 yuan for half a day. Since 2023, she has also worked as a temporary dishwasher in a hotel. These two jobs made her feel comfortable. The customers who came to take pictures wanted beautiful photos and were very polite to the staff. After the dishwashing work was over, she was able to share some dishes that had not been touched with chopsticks. &quot;This kind of physical work doesn&#39;t require using your brain and gives you a sense of accomplishment. As long as you finish the work in front of you, you don&#39;t have to work overtime after get off work.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Doing these two jobs is a rare independent decision-making for her. From a young age, Yue Hang&#39;s life has been arranged by her parents. When she graduated from junior high school, her parents suggested that she study abroad. She agreed. She completed high school and university abroad, and majored in economics, which is easier to find a job. Now, her parents&#39; investment in her education has become a burden and pressure on her. &quot;Even if your parents don&#39;t show their disappointment in front of you, it&#39;s difficult for children to not find this feeling if they have been raised for a long time and cannot find a job. They have not been able to make money for so long and it does not meet their expectations.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yue Hang feels that his qualifications are average, especially not good at taking exams. After returning to China, her parents asked her to take the junior economist exam, but she failed and was unwilling to take other certificates. She was also not good at socializing, and only gradually became more open-minded after returning home. She is not used to fighting for anything. She didn&#39;t write her resume well when she wanted to change jobs. Recently, she changed it to a more formal version when she was looking for a job. She will also write down her experience as a dishwasher to enrich her resume. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, Yue Hang also has a sense of frustration in the face of the times, &quot;It is impossible for me to make more money than my parents. In their era, as long as you worked hard, you would have money, but I worked hard, and I I don’t have money to work overtime.” Yue Hang felt that many of the peers she saw in Shenzhen worked harder than her parents. Their generation worked harder but got less. &quot;We seem to have overdrawn our lives in advance. We have been busy attending cram schools since elementary school. We don&#39;t know what progress we are making. We can&#39;t catch up with a house or even a relaxing vacation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The two years of being a full-time mother and daughter have been the happiest time for Yue Hang in recent years, and she has considered continuing to do so. In 2022, my grandma had an operation. During this period, Yue Hang proposed to his father that he wanted to be her caregiver. &quot;When I was hospitalized before, my parents hired me a caregiver, which paid me two to three hundred (remuneration) a day. I wanted to make this money. Of course, as long as they took care of my food, I wouldn&#39;t ask them to pay the price of a caregiver. Please ask me. But my father doesn&#39;t agree.&quot; Yue Hang feels that he can act as a nanny among relatives. In addition to his grandparents, his parents will also face care needs, because they all only have one child. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yue Hang’s condition has stabilized a lot, and he is currently trying to find a new job, such as the food department or transportation department of IKEA. “It requires physical work, no overtime, plenty of exercise, and you don’t have to worry about so many interpersonal relationships. , taking into account physical health and mental health.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/5pnGTNAYzfxYTyw3tMlHgbRtlytjPo5Ob5t5BLlp.jpg&quot; border=&quot; 0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;679&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/5pnGTNAYzfxYTyw3tMlHgbRtlytjPo5Ob5t5BLlp.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251337&quot;>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Chen Zhitong/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Crazy &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Yue Hang believes that the biggest constraint for children who work full-time is financial resources. She does not want to rely on her parents all the time, so she can only continue to work. For Qingtian, a 37-year-old with 10 years of work experience, she does not have much financial burden, so she can calmly resign and withdraw from the labor market. She refers to herself as &quot;laying down trash&quot;. At the end of 2022, friends forwarded her a topical article about full-time children, with the sentence &quot;You are so typical.&quot; She rolled her eyes and approved of the new title. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The stay-at-home children reminded Qingtian of a report he had read about Japanese people in their thirties and forties who nibbled on the elderly. One of the stories was that a 40-year-old daughter accompanied her 60-year-old mother on a trip abroad. , my daughter is very envious of her mother’s high pension. In &quot;The Choice of Being a Woman&quot;, she saw Chizuru Ueno having a similar discussion in 2003, &quot;&#39;60s generation&#39; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Refers to people aged 60-69&lt;/span>;) whose parents had retired before the economic downturn and widespread layoffs, and received generous pensions. It can be said that they are the first and last generation to fully enjoy the economy. People with high growth and good fortune. But the next generation does not have that kind of protection. It is precisely because this generation’s family has a strong financial background that it provides the possibility for their children to live in old age.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After resigning, his parents gave Qingtian a slap in the face. A large sum of money supported her life, and she put most of it into the stock market. Although she has lost a lot of money, she has confidence in the stock market. “我们家90年代开始炒股，牛市熊市也经历了几次，相信总会回来的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;青田原本是一家中型互联网广告公司的中层干部，让她放下职场的，是工作中感受到的徒劳与荒诞。 2020年，公司提倡降本增效，员工降薪15%，且不发奖金，然而那一年公司业绩并不差。年底公司高层去澳门开年会，青田的领导回来私下向她炫耀，“刚买的劳力士手表不好看，想换一块。”青田想到她手下的员工，“都是985、211的好学生，勤勤恳恳加班，担心失业，大半夜被客户叫起来也没有怨言，可是一个月就几千块，他们有什么错呢？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年青田的一位同事因胰腺癌去世，在葬礼上，入职某头部互联网零售公司的前同事绘声绘色地讲他们办公室里挂着一排AED，新人入职第一件事就是练习做心肺复苏，但因为工资高，内部很多人都想转岗去他们部门。她感慨，“企业文化和我们之前的公司完全不同，不会磨磨唧唧地走流程、开会，就是干！非常有冲劲。”青田觉得价值感受到了冲击，“人没了就什么都没了，大家为什么这么疯狂？这个行业为什么这么疯狂？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;过去一直信奉的“努力工作”“自我实现”的价值感，在青田心里逐渐变成了“自我剥削”“自我洗脑”。她见证过互联网行业大爆发的成功叙事，也经历过对公司利益分配严重失衡的愤怒和失望，她不再去工作中找寻意义。 “工作对普通人的意义就是挣钱养活自己、养活家人，如果家庭有一定的积累，为什么不做一些不一样的选择，让自己和家人都舒服地生活呢？”青田想起那个离世的同事，最后一条豆瓣广播是吐槽和家里的关系，“她到死都没有跟父母和解。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因为是独生子女，青田和父母关系紧密，又因之前有过一段失败的婚姻，她不打算再组建家庭，想维持跟父母一起生活的平衡和快乐。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;青田常住广州，父母住在惠州的乡村，她会经常回村小住。以往工作时只能在中秋和春节回家，看到的是金黄色的稻谷和割剩下的稻茬。现在，她可以完整见证稻田的灌水、插秧、抽穗、收割等各个阶段。她会带上父母一起出游，沿途打点一切，安排参观博物馆和自然风景，哪怕只是逛逛当地菜市场，一家人也很开心。她帮父母拍照，剪辑视频，发现他们其实更希望“被看到”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;父母不干涉青田的选择，她跟父亲交流种花养鸟、书法绘画，跟他说现在生活的丰富程度是过去的五倍。母亲偶尔会焦虑青田离再就业越来越远，但是看到她过得开心，就没有多说什么，还建议她再去攻读学位，经历更多不同的体验。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他们唯一担心的是，当他们“走了”以后，青田一个人无依无靠。这也是青田担心的问题，但她还没有找到解决办法。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/O0LCKe0HfmalBlPeoiPfuD5lEnPky2BXcSD6JJJQ.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（陈志彤/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;你的职能是什么？ &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在豆瓣小组，大龄全职儿女的生活状态明显比年轻人更加轻松而自洽，在一众焦虑和迷茫的标题之间，“37岁全职儿女每天都很快乐”格外醒目。青田回复了这个帖子，表示认同。不过，青田认为全职儿女有两个共同点，一是家庭经济条件好、父母有高额退休金，二是家庭关系融洽。发帖人花匠的情况并不完全与此符合，她不认为全职儿女是独属于殷实家庭的选择。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;花匠是辽宁大连人。 2022年中，花匠的父母退休了，他们的退休金加起来七千多元。当年底，他们又都再找了一份工作，另外有四五千元的收入。花匠说，钱虽然不多，好在一家三口物质欲望都不高。花匠对支出进行了记账统计，每个月，家庭生活费约1000至1500元，父母的零花钱加起来1000元，她的零花钱是1500元，总共三四千元，收入足够覆盖日常支出。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;每周的工作日，花匠负责买菜做饭。她会在前一天下午买好菜，上午9、10点做饭，照例是每天两个青菜，荤菜会在周一做好，比如烧一份红烧肉，一顿吃几块，吃完了再做。母亲中午11:30会回家装饭带走，父亲中午在单位吃，晚上父母吃中午剩下的菜。下午，除了买菜，花匠会动手做面包和点心，给父母做零食。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我妈她是不会做饭，从小就不会做饭，所以打小是我爸做饭。不过我爸只会老一套那种，做的饭也不怎么好吃。”花匠认为父母让她做菜就是他们两个觉得她更适合在家里做饭。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;花匠对这份“工作”有认同感，“我在家做饭好处很多，会按照膳食指南给他们科学的搭配，比如水果、青菜、碳水、牛奶。如果不是我做饭，他们的健康可能没有现在好。”她认为自己和大多数全职儿女不同，她是真的在照顾父母。一位网友回复她帖子，“跟露珠（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;楼主&lt;/span>;）差不多年龄和状态，不过家里主要还是妈妈给做饭，该准备好好提升下烹饪技能了。”花匠问她，“那你的职能是啥？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“你得体现价值嘛，不能只有拿快递是你的职能吧？像我，我管家里的财务，做一家人的未来规划，存钱啊，交房贷啊，买东西啊。我现在不工作了，会想尽一切办法花更少的钱过更好的生活。”买东西前，花匠会想，生活中有什么替代品，例如，她用小苏打来代替洗洁精。如果确实要买，她会首先去二手网站上找全新的商品，或者精打细算地利用电商平台的优惠券。 “你赚钱的时候，计算这些是浪费时间，但是不赚钱的时候，计算就是在挣钱。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;即便在家，花匠的生活也很自律，每天晚上9点睡觉，早上6点起床，白天的时间大多在忙碌。她从来都不是一个懒惰的人，在当全职儿女之前，她换了十几份工作，每次辞职后，她都会努力再找一份工作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她之前的工作大多是文职，例如旅游咨询、酒店前台接待、办公室行政等，辞职的原因几乎都是“跟领导不合”。 “我缺乏情商，讲话直接。刚毕业的时候，完全不懂社会上的事情。我爸爸是工人，妈妈自己做小买卖，他们也教不了我什么。后来我慢慢能看懂眼色了，但在酒桌上这种需要圆滑的场合，我还是不明白。不过我也不想改，情商高可能是在放低自己。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2019年底，花匠辞去了最后一份工作，打算自己开面包店。她在业余时间自学了烘焙，中西式点心都会做，甚至能做生日蛋糕。 2019年11月，她租下一间门店。装修两个月，2020年1月正式营业，但开店仅二十多天就遭遇了新冠疫情封控，再次营业是在2020年5月。 2022年，大连自6月起疫情封控严格，直到11月都没什么生意，花匠不再续租，“不干了，开业三年，赔了十几万。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我问花匠，关店后不久，疫情防控就结束了，后悔吗？她虽然对关店时机感到懊悔，但还是很平静，“我知道我赚不了钱，我做不大，因为我不想雇人，从挑选原材料到制作，到交给顾客，都必须我亲自完成。”她关店也不只因为疫情，她觉得跟顾客打交道很烦，“在服务行业，你会遇到很多奇形怪状的人，我做工作没做够，但我应付人有点受够了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;店关了，花匠的生意还在做，她会通过微店接一些老顾客的单子，赚回自己每个月的社保费。 “挣一千多块钱，不会影响到我生活上的情绪，不会耽误我多少时间，如果多了就不行了，开始烦了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“我不想随大流儿”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;花匠的父母对她不工作而回家的决定很支持，认为他们一家三口是各司其职，母亲不会做饭，父亲做饭不好吃，且两人都是在家待不住的人，喜欢在外工作，家里的事刚好交给花匠。有时候花匠跟母亲汇报她这个月花了多少零花钱，母亲安慰她，“行啊，这些钱从外面找一个做饭的人还不够呢。”她跟母亲说，“我不想上班，你养我。”母亲爽快地说，“养呗，还养不了了？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在花匠看来，父亲比母亲更单纯，有一次她提议，“要不我们把房子都卖了，三个人一起全国旅居，看哪个地方好就在哪个地方住。”父亲说，“那你快点行动起来吧。”有时候花匠觉得，她是家里考虑最多的人，更像个家长，“他们俩经典的一句话是，&#39;你别想那么多，走一步看一步&#39;，根本没有下一步的打算。我做什么他们都支持我，相信我的做法没错。没有我的话，他们俩还在镇里待着，日子肯定过得不如现在。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;花匠和父母在同一个小区买了两套小房子，她先买，后来看到父亲的公积金足够凑一套房子的首付，又建议父母在隔壁的楼栋买了一套。父母不会办理贷款，不会用网上支付，一切手续和还贷计划都由花匠负责。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;父母的健康管理也是花匠在操心，她每年体检，也会安排父母体检。母亲就是在体检的时候筛查出早期宫颈癌，做手术住院期间，花匠一个人全程陪同照顾。后来她还在个人公众号上写了一篇照顾住院病人的指南，“从头到尾非常详细，我是处女座，做事很细心，就算病人瘫床上我都不会让她长褥疮。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“上哪儿找第二个像我一样的孩子？把父母照顾得无微不至，而且我又不结婚生孩子，不让父母六十多岁还要为儿女操心，帮带孩子。”花匠没有结婚生子、组建家庭的打算，所以在生活上一直都与父母紧密相连。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;退回家庭后，花匠有更多时间回归到自己身上，闲暇时爱看电影和书籍，“我一个月能看60部电影。”她尤其喜欢杨德昌的《一一》和西恩·潘的《荒野生存》，最喜欢的小说则是毛姆的《刀锋》，她欣赏男主角拉里的特立独行。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从“随大流”中抽离，摆脱了外界的声音和主流的观念，她能更清醒地认识自己，“原来我是一个不能处理亲密关系的人，我是一个不适合社交的人，我对朋友特别好、特别真诚，但我也想活得自我一点。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/AnfmnE77VwgCr3DKzeklQ7SH0wCHSQ2p80KkNGZC.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;减减今年42岁，北京人，多年在外地工作。 5年前的深圳，减减有一天上班时忽然接到父亲的电话，父亲那会儿在公园散步，走累了坐在路边，想儿子了。减减听到电话那头传来的“想你了”，眼泪一下流了出来。自打毕业后，他就没有和父母住在一起，即使在北京工作，和父母的联系也不多。后来他去天津、上海工作，又追着前妻来到深圳，婚姻没有挽回，离父母却更远了。 “我发现自己追求事业，追求爱情，却一直忽略了父母，我开始想回北京了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;还没等减减完全下定决心，他就得知了父亲突发心肌梗塞住进CCU（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;心脏重症监护室&lt;/span>;）的消息，“我脑子&#39;嗡&#39;的一下，心乱如麻，缓了好一阵。”减减当即辞职，买了机票回北京，在病房见到了父亲。父亲心梗堵塞90%，且伴有严重的心衰，命悬一线，又因肺部有炎症不能立即做手术，整个人瘦到脱相。 “他看见我说，&#39;这回是不是我得把银行卡密码都告诉你了？&#39;我差点又哭出来。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那段时间，减减每天变着花样做饭、熬鸡汤，给父亲送去医院，他明显感到父亲心情好多了，还发短信说病友们都羡慕他，其他人想吃饺子，跟儿女说了好几天才叫来一个外卖。一个月后，父亲做完手术出院，减减也想明白了对他来说什么是最重要的，“不是在事业上取得多大的成绩，因为事业总会有波峰波谷，不是和爱人卿卿我我，因为婚姻不过是利益的结合。只有父母才是真正一辈子对你好的人。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;减减毕业于北京大学广告学系，传播最广的广告作品是哈药六厂的新盖中盖高钙片。 2014年他尝试写剧本，但碰上资本寒冬，剧本写完拍不了，又进了企业工作。现在回家，他重新拾起了写剧本的活儿。 “虽然收入比起以前差很多，也极不稳定，但是我总算有时间陪伴家人了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;减减跟父亲一起生活，父亲退休工资五千多，家里日常开销都由父亲负责。他写剧本的平均收入是一个月5000元，负责缴纳社保、汽车保险、汽油费、物业费和取暖费等，一年大约3万元。他认为自己和父亲在经济支出上是互相帮助，并非啃老，而是全职儿女。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以前工作时，他赚得多，但消费也多，离婚后基本没有剩下多少积蓄；现在，不稳定的收入降低了他的消费欲望，他不旅游、不逛街、不在外吃饭，省去不必要的社交，还学会了理发，很多原本需要花钱才能得到的服务全由自己做，反而存下了一些钱。 “我的养老金肯定没他们高，所以得努力攒钱为将来打算。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;父亲不能完全接受减减的选择，也不支持他写剧本，有时候会对着他说教，“天天窝在家里不是个事。”减减考虑到父亲心脏不好，不想惹他生气，和导演打电话时都躲在房间避开他。有一次实在受不了，出去住了一个星期，回家后发现父亲说话嗓子很别扭，他意识到那是因为父亲一个星期没和人说话了，“我一下子体会到他的孤独，心又软了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“选择做全职儿女放弃了很多东西，我觉得值。”减减回想过去的生活，发现从上幼儿园开始，他就没有好好陪伴父母生活过，“上班的上班，上学的上学，回家后也就是一起吃个饭，然后又各干各的了；等工作了、结婚了就更不用说。”现在，他陪父亲一起散步、研究菜谱、看热播的电视剧、聊天南海北的新闻，最喜欢做的事是给父亲理发、修脚。他获得了一种前所未有的踏实感，“我在拉萨待过半年，心情远比现在浮躁。”&lt;/p>;

became a hot search topic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Mingsheng (pseudonym) works as an accountant in a private company in Zhangjiagang, Jiangsu Province. After downloading a certain chat software, he entered the live broadcast room of female anchor K Bao and became obsessed with it after just one look. According to the rules of the platform game, only by becoming the &quot;big brother&quot; can you be qualified to meet the anchor. His monthly salary was only 6,000 yuan, so he took advantage of his position to secretly transfer public funds for rewards. After becoming the &quot;big brother&quot; in K Bao&#39;s live broadcast room, he became an offline lover with K Bao as he wished, and had a sexual relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of 2022, when the group company reconciled its accounts, it was discovered that the accounts managed by Liu Mingsheng had a large capital deficit. According to an investigation by the public security agency, he embezzled a total of about 123 million yuan in public funds from the company&#39;s accounts, rewarded K Bao with 90 million yuan, and also rewarded two other anchors with several million yuan each. In the end, most of the huge amount of approximately 123 million yuan misappropriated by him was recovered, with a total of 122.68 million yuan recovered. Liu Mingsheng was sentenced to 14 years for job embezzlement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This &quot;you will die if you have too much fun&quot; energy is staggering. In fact, there are many cases of cashiers misappropriating public funds to reward anchors, and there are both male and female cashiers. Ru Yin works as a cashier for a real estate development group in Guangxi. Starting from 2020, she fell in love with a male anchor on the Douyin APP and rewarded him crazily. When she had no money, she used public funds. Police investigation found that her Douyin account was recharged with more than 5 million yuan in the second half of 2020, and more than 4.3 million yuan was used to reward male anchors, of which more than 1.44 million yuan was the company&#39;s public funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another example is that Li served as the cashier of a company in Zhuhai in the Jinan Region. From December 2018 to April 2020, he took advantage of loopholes in the company&#39;s financial management to transfer 48.264303 million public funds to his personal account for rewards. Female anchors, game recharges, entertainment consumption, girlfriends, etc., including live broadcast rewards of more than 20 million. After the incident, the &quot;big brother on the list&quot; was sentenced to 12 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A common feature of this type of incident is that the cashier’s income is not high, but the money he hands over is a lot. If an individual does not have good character and professional ethics, it is easy to fall into an unbalanced mentality, and the cashier understands the company best. Where are the financial loopholes, so once they &quot;calculate mentally but not intentionally&quot;, the company&#39;s financial system will be ineffective at least for a period of time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another direction worth thinking about is: What kind of industry is online live broadcasting, and whose needs do it mainly meet? What is the mentality of those people who squander their own money, their parents&#39; money, and even the company&#39;s money to reward anchors of the opposite sex? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Online live broadcast includes several different business formats, one of which is the ascendant live broadcast of goods. It would be wrong to regard it as just a new distribution channel, because compared with offline channels or other &quot;traditional&quot; e-commerce channels, anchors sell more than just goods. Especially those anchors who are more successful, while selling &quot;personality&quot; and providing emotional value, have a celebrity-fan relationship, which often satisfies the best imagination and even sexual fantasies of fans of the opposite sex about their other half. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Or, it can even be said that those popular anchors clearly have a quiet, warm or beautiful &quot;personality&quot; to collect money from their fans, but they even give some extra rewards. It’s so “kind” to have products that can be used. Therefore, along this path, part of &quot;live streaming with goods&quot; will evolve into &quot;live streaming with rewards&quot;. Since you can make money without bringing goods, then you will not bring goods or sell goods, but sell &quot;characters&quot; directly to fans. &quot;That&#39;s it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, &quot;live streaming rewards&quot; also come from many different sources, with very different audiences and properties, so they need to be discussed separately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, another evolutionary path is that in the past, flyover juggling, street busking and begging have moved from offline to online. Their main audience is either the grassroots or the unspecified public. This article will not go into details. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another evolutionary path is to make the desire to share and peek into the Internet and further videoize it. Some people share their work, life, hobbies or skills with everyone through videos. Some are live broadcasts, some are recorded, and there are also successful cases, such as fishing masters, trap tying kings, &quot;hand-made people&quot; and so on. Let everyone It increases your understanding and knowledge of unfamiliar areas, or allows everyone to experience the life they long for. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;live broadcast reward&quot; we focus on here has a significant anchor-fan relationship, and is generally a male anchor-female fan, female anchor-male fan relationship, which is inevitably somewhat sexual. Meaning&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Eat and drink, men and women, are where the great desires of man exist&quot; and &quot;eating and sex are also the nature&quot;. Needless to say, a large part of human vitality is tied to sexual energy or sexual desire. The &quot;talent&quot; who has fascinated countless middle-aged and elderly women, the &quot;alluring smile&quot; who has fascinated countless middle-aged and elderly men, and the celebrities who have fascinated countless young men and women are all the same in essence. When it comes to the appearance, appearance, etc. of these anchors or celebrities. Temperament and &quot;personality&quot; satisfy the opposite sex&#39;s best fantasy about their partner. This is the origin and dynamics of this type of &quot;pure live broadcast reward&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Xun said that dissatisfaction is an upward wheel. Very few people are completely satisfied with their current lives. They are dissatisfied with their jobs, their boyfriends, or their spouses, so they expect an ideal life, including an ideal spouse. This is human nature. But first of all, you must understand the boundaries of your abilities and how you are ranked in this society. This way, you will have an objective judgment of whether your current life is &quot;worthy of you&quot; and whether the world is &quot;worthy&quot;. , He who knows himself will understand. Then for the current situation, change it when it needs to be changed, and accept it when it needs to be accepted. This is reconciling with yourself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And if for the sake of spiritual satisfaction, you reward a host of the opposite sex with a large amount of property at home or even your own property, it is actually not improving but ruining your life. The above-mentioned male and female cashiers misappropriated public funds to reward anchors of the opposite sex. This is exactly the case. In short, everyone should use their strong vitality to improve themselves, so that they can get more and more good things worthy of them. This is a way to make positive use of their own life energy, rather than consuming all their resources and even their vitality. Fulfill your fantasies. Regardless of personal honor and future, just to &quot;die for the fun of it&quot;, this is a good opportunity to live in this world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 23 Sep 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中美成立经济领域工作组]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257436]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;In order to implement the important consensus reached by the heads of state of China and the United States at their meeting in Bali, according to the Vice Premier of the State Council, China and the United States According to the consensus reached by He Lifeng, the Chinese leader of the economic and trade side, and Janet Yellen, the US Secretary of the Treasury, China and the United States agreed to establish an economic working group, including an &quot;economic working group&quot; and a &quot;financial working group.&quot; The &quot;Economic Working Group&quot; is led by officials at the deputy ministerial level of the Treasury Department of China and the United States, and the &quot;Financial Working Group&quot; is led by officials at the deputy ministerial level of the People&#39;s Bank of China and the U.S. Treasury Department.

The previous &quot;Ghost Trilogy&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;The Abode of the Heart&quot;, &quot;Ghost&quot; and &quot;Yela&quot;&lt;/span>;) and &quot;Immigration Trilogy&quot; &quot;Music&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Barbara&quot;, &quot;Phoenix&quot; and &quot;Transit&quot;&lt;/span>;), which has earned him a good reputation in the international film industry . So he struck while the iron was hot and continued to launch a series of works with the theme of &quot;Elemental Elves&quot;. &quot;Undine&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;2020&lt;/span>;) with the theme of the water goddess is the first film in the series; it won the jury award at the 2023 Berlin Film Festival The grand prize of the group, &quot;Red Sky&quot; with the theme of the fire elf Salomanda, is the second installment in this series. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By sorting out Petzold’s creative trajectory, we can find some obvious characteristics. His works are highly intellectual, and he will provide almost essay-like explanations around certain specific themes. At the same time, he places great emphasis on the core position occupied by concepts. Under the guidance of such creative concepts, the fate of classical mythological characters overlaps with the situation of modern Germans (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;&quot;Phoenix&quot;&lt;/span>;), the plight of the Jews during World War II also collided with the fate of Arab refugees in contemporary Europe (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;&quot;Transit&quot;&lt;/span>;), stirring up a wonderful chemical reaction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But we also have to point out that although the concept of Petzold&#39;s film is charming, it is slightly rigid in terms of flesh and texture, and lacks some real and perceptible vitality. This problem is particularly exposed in Undine: an attempt to combine a water spirit from classical mythology with the life of a contemporary German industrial diver, which is very interesting on paper, but fails to translate into images In the end, it is easy to fall into the predicament of wildly swinging between the metaphysical and the physical, and end up relying on neither. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Petzold must have realized his mistake in Undine. Therefore, when filming his new work &quot;Red Sky&quot;, he sought a lighter brushstroke: the metaphysical mythological elements are hidden deeper, while the metaphysical daily life is pushed to the foreground. The plot is set during a summer vacation. Leon, a troubled young writer, is invited to his friend Felix&#39;s seaside holiday home to try to finish the novel in a quiet environment while waiting for the publisher&#39;s decision. But during this period of time that should have calmed him down, he passively got acquainted with the beautiful and lively girl Nadia, and her lover Devi who had a close relationship with her. Leon&#39;s heart was stirred up, but the approaching deadline (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Deadline&lt;/span>;) and the burden of intellectuals made him Nadia&#39;s emotions become tangled and twisted, creating a series of comedies and dramas in the lives of four people. At the same time, a wildfire is spreading inland, becoming the disturbing background sound of the entire story. No one knows whether this light vacation will eventually end in raging flames. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like the titles of many of Petzold&#39;s previous films, &quot;Red Sky&quot; is also full of potential. It not only refers to the sky dyed red by wildfires on a concrete level, but also metaphorically alludes to the sexual tension that is about to emerge between the several protagonists, as well as the overwhelming sexual tension in the &quot;Revelation&quot; volume of the New Testament. Apocalyptic scene. But the film&#39;s story ultimately fails to live up to the full potential of its title. The huge destructive power of wildfires is almost wiped out by a shot of wild boars running in the forest and the off-screen deaths of two supporting characters; and &quot;Memento mori&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;will die&lt;/span>;)-style death warning also fails to be integrated with the character&#39;s desires. In the final analysis, &quot;Red Sky&quot; still tells the story of a self-centered male protagonist chasing the heroine and awakening during the pursuit. Whether it is his friends, publishers, the fire and death, or even the heroine herself, they seem to be tools that lead him to self-awakening. And there remains a huge gulf between Petzold&#39;s prowess in seductive concept-building and what can only be described as a barely above-average narrative articulation. Red Skies is an improvement over its predecessor, but there&#39;s a gap that still needs to be filled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/Zh1Vsz896cTN46UvPe0CjDwWeYJydBhnwEzqf2Qb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;679&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/Zh1Vsz896cTN46UvPe0CjDwWeYJydBhnwEzqf2Qb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250590&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Hide And the master of melodrama&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Compared with his meek performance in narrative and expression, Petzold&#39;s ability to write romantic relationships and set off the love atmosphere is outstanding. It is easy to forget that Germans have always been famous for their seriousness, whether they are romantic poets like Goethe and Holderlin or melodrama masters like Douglas Sirk and Rainer Werner Fassbinder. He grew up nourished by the Rhine River. To a certain extent, Petzold is also the heir to the romantic mantle of his predecessors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the valuable thing about Petzold is that his writing about love relationships not only has a German-style desperate romance, but also has a subtle temperament that is rare among European and American creators. Petzold&#39;s male protagonists always seem to be more interested in the souls of their admirers than in possessing their bodies, but they are always so shy and clumsy in their pursuit of each other that The end of happiness seems forever out of reach. In contrast, Petzold&#39;s heroines are always as erratic as wandering spirits, unable to be defined or captured. They are free souls who make no secret of their feelings for the person they love, but they always refuse to be defined as immutable symbols and never become objects. Therefore, in Petzold&#39;s film, the dislocation game of chasing and dodging has been going on. This game seems to have been going on since the birth of men and women, and it will continue until the end of the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Red Sky&quot;, the setting of summer vacation and country holiday house, the lighter tone compared with Petzold&#39;s previous works, and the characters&#39; artistic and intellectual atmosphere The conversation will more or less remind us of those in Eric Rohmer&#39;s films, those satirical ridicules of hesitant straight men with good intentions, and those under the comedic tone, which are emotionless and emotionless. perspective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But on the other hand, Petzold’s talent for creating romantic situations, his intense love for female characters, and the emotional relationships between male and female characters in his films become more intense because of evasion and restraint. , will remind people of another film master who is good at creating romantic atmosphere-Wong Kar-wai. Perhaps Paula Bell, the actress in &quot;Transit&quot;, &quot;Undine&quot; and &quot;Red Sky&quot;, has quietly become Petzold&#39;s Maggie Cheung. The plots of these movies may soon disappear from our minds, but Paula Bell&#39;s bright smile and red dress will remain in our memories for a long time. Through the male director&#39;s way, we cannot fully understand what they mean. Thoughts and feelings, but still (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;or - precisely because of this&lt;/span>;) eyes full of admiration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[餐厅员工发顾客打娃视频后赔1万离职，警方如此调解令人费解]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257400]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;According to reports, on September 19, a Western restaurant stopped a mother from beating her daughter and posted the relevant video online. The employee, Mr. Jiang, resigned and left Changsha after compensating the other party 10,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The surveillance video that Mr. Jiang previously posted online showed that the woman involved, Hu, was holding a shopping bag and yelling at the little girl. Later, she took her child to the Western restaurant where Mr. Jiang worked and asked her child to explain to her the process of causing trouble. At this moment, Hu lost control. He put down the shopping bag in his hand, lifted the chair next to him and tried to hit the girl. Mr. Jiang and his colleagues stepped forward to stop him. A nearby merchant revealed in an interview with a reporter from Hunan TV that when the mother and daughter passed by his store, the girl suddenly fell down and the ice cream in her hand spilled on the floor, causing her clothes to be stained. Immediately, Hu lost control of his emotions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Jiang said that after the incident, Hu came to the restaurant many times, saying that he should not have spread the video online and threatened to die in the restaurant. After mediation by the local police station, Mr. Jiang paid the other party 10,000 yuan in compensation for mental losses and medical expenses, and then voluntarily submitted his resignation to his boss. Netizens expressed: &quot;Those who hit people are fine, but those who stopped them will be punished&quot;, &quot;I really feel sorry for this doll when I see this video&quot;, and some netizens said, &quot;It&#39;s really chilling.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The restaurant employee got into trouble when he prevented the woman Hu from beating her daughter in public and uploading the video to the Internet. This matter involves many aspects, including domestic violence, public supervision, privacy rights and law enforcement issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, it must be clear that Hu’s behavior of beating his daughter in public is a typical act of domestic violence. It not only violates public order and good customs, but also violates relevant laws. According to Article 2 of the Anti-Domestic Violence Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China, domestic violence refers to physical, mental and other violations committed by family members in the form of beating, binding, mutilation, restriction of personal freedom, regular verbal abuse, and intimidation. Article 5 stipulates that minors, the elderly, disabled people, pregnant and lactating women, and seriously ill patients who suffer domestic violence shall be given special protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is the duty of the police station to deal with Hu’s illegal behavior as soon as possible. Article 33 of the Anti-Domestic Violence Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China stipulates that if the perpetrator commits domestic violence and constitutes a violation of public security management, he shall be subject to public security management penalties in accordance with the law. It can be seen that when parents beat their children, law enforcement agencies cannot turn a blind eye on the grounds that &quot;honest officials cannot handle household matters.&quot; In this incident, Hu publicly beat his daughter, which caused a very bad public perception. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the restaurant employee Mr. Jiang’s behavior of publishing the video, from a legal perspective, he did not infringe on Hu’s portrait rights. Because this is an exposure of illegal activities in public places, Mr. Jiang is exercising the citizen’s right to supervise. Article 1020 of the Civil Code stipulates that the following acts may be reasonably carried out without the consent of the portrait right holder: other acts of making, using, or disclosing the portrait of the portrait right holder in order to safeguard public interests or the legitimate rights and interests of the portrait right holder. By exposing his video, Mr. Jiang obviously hopes to draw social attention to the phenomenon of domestic violence and jointly protect the rights of minors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taking a step back, even if Hu believes that his rights and interests have been violated, he should protect his rights and interests through legal means such as litigation, rather than through improper means such as making trouble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu made trouble in the restaurant many times. However, the police station did not hold him accountable. Instead, through mediation, Mr. Jiang was asked to compensate 10,000 yuan for mental damages and medical expenses. This move not only chilled Mr. Jiang&#39;s heart, but also sent a wrong signal: If illegal acts can be resolved through mediation, or even reverse compensation can be obtained, wouldn&#39;t it condone more people&#39;s willful behavior? In this way, the law loses its majesty and justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a law enforcement agency, it should be based on the law, focus on protecting the rights and interests of minors and the courageous behavior of citizens, and have zero tolerance for illegal activities, so as to form a legal deterrent and guide social atmosphere. Improve the quality of citizens through legal education. Regrettably, the police station allowed the parties’ emotions to influence the outcome of the case, acquiescing to the woman’s behavior of “getting more and more unreasonable”. Such mediation is inconsistent with legal principles. Netizens generally questioned this mediation and expressed their simple view of justice. Law enforcement agencies should re-investigate the matter and hold the offenders accountable, rather than letting those who bravely act for justice lose money and jobs. Only in this way can people&#39;s faith in judicial authority not be damaged. After all, the majesty and credibility of the law are often reflected in the daily actions of law enforcers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti , Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[如果你导弹打得不够准，是因为你人靠得不够近丨军事]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257374]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/20/gup4AaFCsszUqfElPfxsoCHZgB5ey11TUdvQehIu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/gup4AaFCsszUqfElPfxsoCHZgB5ey11TUdv QehIu. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251331&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;September 13, 2023, Sevastopol, Crimea region, Smoke billowed out from the attacked shipyard &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, Ukrainian news said that the Ukrainian military In the early morning of September 13, 2023, 10 missiles and 3 unmanned boats launched an attack on the Sevastopol military base in the Crimean Peninsula, causing a fire at the Sevastopol Shipyard and two ships under repair were damaged. The losses include the Russian Black Sea Fleet&#39;s Ropcha-class landing ship &quot;Minsk&quot; and the Kilo-class diesel-powered submarine &quot;Rostov-on-Don&quot; which cost up to US$300 million and was commissioned in 2014. Rostov-on-Don). Satellite images of the scene showed that the two ships were severely damaged and were extremely difficult and expensive to repair. Considering that such a project was difficult to complete under the wartime system, they basically had to be scrapped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Russia also admitted that it was attacked by Ukrainian missiles and that some ships were damaged. The situation announced by both sides basically confirmed the results of this attack. This is the largest loss suffered by the Black Sea Fleet since the sinking of the flagship Moskva after the war between Russia and Ukraine. It also sets a record for the first time in history that a submarine is hit by a missile. What’s even more amazing is that just two days after this attack, Ukraine announced that it had used missiles and drones to attack the S-400 air defense missile system on the Crimean Peninsula. This system has always been considered the strongest in Russia. Currently in active air defense weapons, Turkey even had tense relations with the United States and NATO in order to purchase this system. This time, it was beheaded by Ukraine behind enemy lines in actual combat, which was shocking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This round of continuous attacks with a combination of punches is obviously not the result of an accident, but a joint military operation between the Ukrainian intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense, in which the actions of the Ukrainian special forces can be said to be indispensable. without. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two days before launching the missile attack, that is, on September 11, the Ukrainian intelligence agency announced that the special forces had successfully seized two offshore oil and gas drilling platforms in the Black Sea and successfully removed Russian equipment from the platforms. military installations. The map shows that the two platforms captured by the Ukrainian special forces are about fifty kilometers away from the Crimean coastline. The Russian army has set up air and sea warning radars on them to control the Black Sea area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This attack did not attract much attention from domestic public opinion. Some media even believed that it was a political show after Ukraine’s counterattack failed, because the battle to seize the two platforms was not fierce and not too big. military value. However, in my opinion, the battle to seize the sea platform is the prelude to this attack, because Ukraine does not have stealth fighter equipment that can penetrate the enemy&#39;s air defense network, so it must try to shorten the reaction time of the opponent&#39;s air defense weapons, and these two This platform happens to be Russia&#39;s peripheral observation point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the start of the 2003 Iraq War, the U.S. military used special forces to successfully seize three Iraqi offshore drilling platforms in the Persian Gulf. On the other hand, it is to prevent Iraq from dumping oil into the Persian Gulf and polluting the environment like it did during the Gulf War. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the operation that year, in addition to the British and American special forces, the Polish Thunder Special Task Force also assumed the offensive mission of a platform. This kind of battle to seize maritime platforms is referred to as VBSS (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Visit, board, search and seize&lt;/span>;) in the field of special operations. VBSS The mission is often only accomplished by elite maritime special operations units. The complexity of such operations lies in the fact that it involves combat maneuvers from underwater to the surface, and also includes extremely close indoor combat. It not only requires a large amount of pre-war reconnaissance, but also requires a large amount of targeted actual combat training by operational units before they can make up their minds to implement it. This kind of maritime point-taking operation generally cannot be just a political statement mission, because the risks and costs are too high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen from the missile attack two days later that Ukraine&#39;s action to seize the Black Sea drilling platform is only part of its huge action plan. In fact, the follow-up actions are the key to victory. After the submarine and landing ship were attacked by missiles, Ukraine launched a missile attack one day later. The battle rhythm seemed not compact enough. But in fact, the U.S. special forces did not delay after seizing the platform. Another attack team quietly landed on the Crimean Peninsula under the cover of night, approached the submarines and landing ships in the shipyard, and used thermal imaging Shoot it from multiple angles. After the attack, these latent special operations personnel conducted reconnaissance and assessment of the bombing effects before quietly withdrawing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because air-launched missile attacks involve issues with the angle of incidence, it is necessary to construct a three-dimensional image of the target, and the inspection needs to confirm its radar information or thermal imaging information, all of which require multi-angle technical reconnaissance. The United States may be able to rely on its powerful satellite and reconnaissance aircraft platforms for reconnaissance. For Ukraine, which lacks technical reconnaissance means, using special forces or covert operators to conduct close reconnaissance is a good alternative. And even for a country like the United States with strong technical reconnaissance capabilities, close-in reconnaissance by special forces is still one of the optional methods. For example, during the Gulf War, the United States sent multiple special operations teams into Iraq in order to find Iraqi Scud missiles. Conduct close reconnaissance from the rear. In addition, for collecting the signal characteristics of enemy air defense weapons, deploying special operations personnel for close detection is also a very feasible method, because with only a set of signal receivers, these lurking personnel can obtain the spectrum information of surrounding warning radars for a long time , and can also obtain more comprehensive signal intelligence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people believe that the emergence of drones can replace special operations personnel, but in fact it is people, not machines, who win wars. Only when the quality of people matches technical means can we defeat powerful opponents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 20:26:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[10人遇难，强龙卷风突袭江苏后，救灾与保险赔付正进行]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257406]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/22/d0f40bac84.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/22/d0f40bac84. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251665&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 20, the scene of the tornado disaster in Nancai Township, Suqian City.

This sudden disaster hit parts of Suqian City and Yancheng City, Jiangsu Province on September 19, 2023. According to official reports from the two places, a total of 10 people were killed and 8 injured. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two days later, on Liyuan Road, Nancai Township, Suqian City, Li Peng had been immersed in picking up all kinds of debris at home and in the supermarket, and cleaning the passage; in another town in the city, Daxing Town North Street, a 68-year-old Chen Jianqiang climbed up to the roof of his house, collected the tiles blown by the tornado, and prepared to re-roof the roof. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two-kilometer-long Nancai Township South Street has generally returned to its usual order. Downed trees and broken glass have been cleared away, and temporary stalls are ready to be set up.

Tornadoes of level EF2 and above are generally called strong tornadoes, and tornadoes of level EF2 are generally called strong tornadoes. It can cause considerable damage, it can uproot trees; an EF3 tornado can even knock over a train. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Suqian, tornadoes are not a common natural disaster and they come and go quickly. In Yancheng, according to the Propaganda Department of the Funing County Party Committee in Yancheng City, an average of 4.8 tornadoes occur in Jiangsu every year, of which 2.6 occur in Yancheng. Yancheng is the urban area with the highest frequency of occurrence. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“I was so scared at that moment”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When the tornado hit at around 5 o’clock in the evening on September 19, Luo Qi was picking up his children from school and did not notice it. figure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I got home, the street was in a mess. Luo Qi saw that on South Street, electric wires were blazing and cars were on fire. There is a small market on the street every day, right in front of Luo Qi&#39;s house. One of the sheds in front of her house was blown away and disappeared, and the other one was tied to a tree with a rope, but it hit the freezer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Luo Qi checked the surveillance video at home and found that the three minutes before the tornado struck were unusually calm, with only light rain falling. Starting at 17:11, the surveillance video recorded a loud wind noise, and the shed at the door was blown. Then the wind became louder and louder, a red four-corner tent floated by the roadside, the big box was blown away, and all the small objects on the ground began to fly everywhere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Luo Qi said that the child&#39;s grandmother was washing vegetables at the door. When she saw something was wrong and wanted to go back into the house, the tricycle was blown up by the wind and pushed against the wall. The car window glass penetrated her elbows and feet, and she went to the hospital that night for stitches. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The stall owner next to Luo Qi’s house was not so lucky. He was picked up by the wind and fell to the other side of the road. At that time, a wrist-thick main cable suddenly fell down on the street, bursting into flames, and everyone was afraid of being electrocuted. &quot;I was so frightened at that moment.&quot; Luo Qi said that it was the first time in more than 30 years that she had seen such a violent tornado. The stall owner&#39;s wife kept asking for help, but no one dared to rescue her. Later, the police cordoned off the scene, and the cables were still on fire after the power was artificially cut off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On Liyuan Road, which intersects with South Street, Li Peng opened a small supermarket. In his memory, the tornado lasted no more than a few minutes. But in those few minutes, the tornado tore off almost all the roofs on both sides of the street. &quot;Those asbestos tiles and sheds were hanging in the sky, as high as an airplane, blowing everywhere.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Peng’s home is a 16-year-old tile-roofed house. Since the house has never had any problems before, Li Peng has not reinforced or renovated the house. The tile-roofed house suffered heavy losses in this tornado. The roof kept leaking and the furniture and doors inside were smashed. &quot;I haven&#39;t calculated the amount of damage. I can only make detailed statistics when repairs start.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the tornado moved all the way to Daxing Town, it was already around 6 o&#39;clock. Fante, a 14-year-old girl, just came home from school. She saw a black thing slowly rolling up from a distance. &quot;It seemed to be connected to the sky, very long.&quot; During dinner, the lights at home flickered on and off, and soon the power went out. A strong wind blew into Fanter&#39;s house. Grandma went to block the two glass doors, but she couldn&#39;t close them. Fanter ran to help, &quot;but there was a strong suction that sucked me to the door and blew me into the tree.&quot; Fanter, who weighed 85 pounds, hugged the big tree outside the door and did not dare to move. He did not come down along the trunk until the wind stopped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to &quot;Jiangsu Weather&quot; news on September 20, Jiangsu was affected by two tornadoes on September 19. The first tornado was in Suqian Economic Development Zone and Daxing Town from 17:00 to 18:00; the other was in Funing County, Yancheng City from 20:16 to 35:00. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the official public account of the Suqian Emergency Management Bureau, the tornado disaster mainly occurred in towns and villages, with densely populated areas, complex building structures, and the occurrence period coincided with off-duty hours. According to preliminary statistics, 5,512 people were affected by the strong tornado, 1,646 houses were generally damaged, 137 houses collapsed, 41.8 hectares of crops were damaged, 405 people were temporarily relocated, and some walls of more than 2,000 square meters of pig houses collapsed and the roof collapsed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/22/9a3ba8adc3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/22/9a3ba8adc3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251666&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On the roadside in Nancai Township, electric workers are repairing lines.

Relatively speaking, tornadoes occur more frequently in Yancheng City. The private rescue teams along the Jiangsu coast have conducted targeted training on thunderstorms and hurricanes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At around 6 pm on the 19th, 13 members of the Blue Sky Rescue Team rushed to Nancai Township, Economic Development Zone. The local fire rescue team had arrived at the scene. The Blue Sky Team members assisted in clearing down fallen trees and scattered debris. etc., to open up a smooth road; at the same time, we checked the power supply lines to prevent secondary disasters such as leakage. &quot;We continued working until two o&#39;clock in the morning the next day.&quot; Road cleanup in Nancai Township was basically completed on the 20th. Suqian Blue Sky Rescue Team sent 12 reinforcements to Daxing Town in the afternoon to investigate the disaster situation, mainly assisting township staff to verify whether there were any people who had lost contact after the disaster. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Wei said that after the tornado passes through, another task is to clean up the debris on the facade of the building. For example, the air conditioner on the edge of the eaves was blown to the outside of the bracket and needs to be adjusted. The severely damaged roof There are broken tiles on the floor, which should be cleaned as soon as possible. &quot;Prevent the heavy rain after the tornado from falling down the originally skewed items, causing secondary disasters.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Chen Jianqiang and his wife, residents of North Street in Daxing Town, the main problem is that after the roof tiles are broken, How to fall asleep at night. Daughter Chen Guo said that the roof of her parents&#39; house had just been renovated a few days ago, and they spent three to four thousand yuan to replace it with new tiles. Unexpectedly, the tornado ripped through most of the roof, and the electrical appliances in the house were also soaked in rain all night. Fortunately, the corridor was made of hard cement boards, so the two old men laid several layers of quilts on the corridor and spent the night. On September 20, my uncle, who was in his seventies, came to help repair the roof. I didn’t know when it would be repaired. Someone from the village registered the loss of the house, but the old man didn&#39;t know how to subsidize it in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of September 20, the Suqian Emergency Management Bureau issued a WeChat article stating that it had insured urban and rural residents of Suqian City with public safety urban and rural assistance insurance, which would cover urban and rural housing in Suqian City due to floods and typhoons. Compensation for house losses caused by natural disasters such as landslides, landslides, fires and explosions. The compensation standard is that for urban housing, the main structure insurance amount is 180,000 yuan/household, and the interior decoration insurance amount is 120,000 yuan/household; for rural housing, the main structure insurance amount is 180,000 yuan/household, and the interior decoration insurance amount is 40,000 yuan/household. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The underwriter of this project is mainly the Suqian Branch of the People&#39;s Insurance Company of China Co., Ltd. Zheng Xinbo, the company&#39;s contact person, told Southern Weekend reporters that this private housing insurance is purchased by the government, and each household pays 2 yuan. , have been purchasing continuously for many years. After the disaster occurred, they sent more than 30 staff to the villages and towns on the 20th to verify the damage and determine the damage. The first batch of compensation will be completed before the National Day holiday. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relatively speaking, Yancheng City has more experience in dealing with tornadoes. Public information shows that on June 23, 2012, Yancheng &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;>;City&lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;file://item/%E9%98%9C%E5% AE%81/871643%3ffromModule=lemma_inlink&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; text-decoration: none;&quot;>;Funing&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; text -decoration: none;&quot;>;,&lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;file://item/%E5%B0%84%E9%98%B3/871862%3ffromModule=lemma_inlink&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; text-decoration: none;&quot;>;Sheyang&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;An EF4 tornado occurred in some areas, with winds exceeding level 17. 99 people were killed and 846 injured. The local government built the Yancheng Memorial Hall for Fighting the &quot;6.23&quot; Tornado. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Funing County Party Committee Propaganda Department stated that Funing County has also formulated corresponding emergency plans for natural disasters that occur more frequently. After the tornado, the &quot;9.19&quot; Typhoon Emergency Rescue Command was established in the affected town as soon as possible; special teams were arranged to go to each disaster-stricken village to find out the situation, grasp the disaster situation as soon as possible and report it quickly. Four rounds of sifting search and rescue operations were carried out overnight on September 19. In addition, 129 disaster-stricken people were urgently relocated and resettled by staying with relatives and friends, staying in hotels, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jiangsu is a tornado-prone area in the country. According to &quot;Jiangsu Meteorology&quot; news, from 1956 to 2015, a total of 109 tornadoes occurred in Jiangsu, with the highest proportion occurring in summer, reaching 79.8%, with an annual average of 1.5. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why Jiangsu is prone to tornadoes is that the province has a flat terrain, dense rivers and lakes, and is located in the north-south climate transition zone. Cold and warm air currents frequently meet, which can easily form strong convective weather including tornadoes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meteorological experts in the above article said that Jiangsu is usually less prone to tornadoes in mid-to-late September, but recently due to higher temperatures and the influence of the Jianghuai cyclone, relatively strong tornadoes have occurred. dynamic conditions. Against this background, a relatively rare tornado event occurred in Jiangsu on September 19. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the 21st, Wang Xiaohua, deputy director of the Jiangsu Provincial Meteorological Observatory, said in an interview with CCTV that the Jiangsu Provincial Meteorological Observatory has built a strong convection and strong wind demonstration system from 2021 to 2023. , some preliminary forecast and warning capabilities of tornadoes. In the next step, the meteorological department will use multi-source observation data such as multi-band radar collaborative observation to improve and optimize tornado early warning technology and indicators based on the characteristics of climate change, and further improve forecast and early warning capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Local residents are pseudonyms in the article)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[白切鸡寿司走红，年轻人流行的“中餐日作”是真香吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257296]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 17:30:15&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 17:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[钱锺书回避鲁迅？No，他开启了“悄悄关注”模式]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257339]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/22/Al0NA8piZmtUhLaOo6f35jIRv7oOmF4B0asgnIe8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;732&quot; height=&quot;487&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/22/Al0NA8piZmtUhLaOo6f35jIRv7oOmF4B 0asgnIe8. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251595&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;From left: Lin Yutang, Lu Xun, Soong Ching Ling, Smedley, Li Peihua (Secretary of Soong Ching Ling) ). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Qian Zhongshu rarely talked about Lu Xun publicly, he could not &quot;avoid&quot; Lu Xun. Crystal once said in &quot;Miscellaneous Notes of Shi Qian&#39;s Throwing Books&quot; that at a symposium, Qian Zhongshu praised Lu Xun&#39;s short stories for being well written, but not suitable for long stories. The most well-known person is Qian Zhongshu&#39;s opening speech at the &quot;Lu Xun and Chinese and Foreign Culture&quot; academic seminar. This article was later published in &quot;Literary Journal&quot; on October 23, 1986, and collected in &quot;The Edge of Life&quot;. In his opening speech, Qian Zhongshu said a few words &quot;as usual&quot; based on people&#39;s &quot;public opinions&quot; on Lu Xun at that time: &quot;Lu Xun was a great man. The greater the figure, the more aspects can be observed; &#39;Chinese and foreign culture&#39; is a big The bigger the topic, the wider the scope of the problems that can occur.&quot; The main spirit of his speech was to hope that everyone can &quot;speak freely without bending the meaning to seek common ground&quot;, and could not see the true evaluation of Lu Xun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Qian Zhongshu and Lu Xun also had a period of time in the same city. In September 1927, Lu Xun left Guangzhou and lived in Shanghai until his death in October 1936. Qian Zhongshu graduated from Tsinghua University in the summer of 1933 and taught at Guanghua University. He began studying at Oxford in the autumn of 1935, so he spent more than two years in Shanghai. However, they were only from the same city, and the two of them had never been seen crossing paths. However, as a later scholar and because of Lu Xun&#39;s huge influence, Qian Zhongshu inevitably had to &quot;encounter&quot; Lu Xun intentionally or unintentionally when writing. &quot;On the Parallel Study of Lu Xun and Qian Zhongshu&quot; written by Liu Yukai and &quot;On the Comparative Study of Lu Xun and Qian Zhongshu Literature&quot; written by Sui Qing&#39;e have all made comparisons from an academic level. Scholars such as Xie Yong, Wang Peijun, Li Guotao and Qian Zhijun have made comparisons in their writings. There are also elucidations from time to time, and I would like to unearth several examples related to Lu Xun from Qian Zhongshu&#39;s writings, which may fill the gaps. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;The Besieged City&quot;, Sun Roujia&#39;s uncle and aunt hold important positions in a large cotton factory and have always looked down upon Fang Hongjian. Once, Fang Hongjian and Sun Roujia quarreled again over the arrival of his aunt. When he learned that his aunt wanted to find a position for him in the factory, he jumped up and shouted: &quot;Who wants her to find trouble for me? I can&#39;t even beg for food.&quot; Don&#39;t ask her for it! Isn&#39;t it enough that she has two lackeys, Bobby and you, Sun Roujia? You tell her that Fang Hongjian &#39;has no skills but a very bad temper&#39;, and you won&#39;t be a lackey of a capitalist lackey.&quot; This paragraph of text , immediately reminds people of Lu Xun&#39;s famous article &quot;&quot;Bereaved&quot; and &quot;The Capitalist&#39;s Lacking Lackey&quot; published in 1930, which criticized Liang Shiqiu. Although Qian Zhongshu was studying in Tsinghua University at the time, he would not have missed the articles on the Lu-Liang debate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 84 of the first volume of the Commercial Press&#39;s &quot;Notes of Rong&#39;an Pavilion&quot;, reading the notes of Yue Ke&#39;s &quot;History&quot;, Qian Zhongshu excerpted the following paragraph in Volume 12 and added a note:&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the summer of the 10th year of the reign of Emperor Xizong (Wanyan) of the Jin Dynasty, Long Jian (present) in the Yuzhai Palace, there was a heavy thunderstorm Arrive, break the pillar and go away. Everyone was shocked, thinking it was ominous, and wanted to look at it in disgust. Some people thought that a general amnesty should be granted, so they called Zhang Jun, a bachelor, to draft the imperial edict. Among them are the words &quot;Gu Zi is ignorant&quot; and &quot;Looking at Yu Xiaozi&quot;. The translator did not know the meaning of Tuo Qianchong, so he said: &quot;Han&#39;er is strong in knowledge, and he relies on words to criticize my Lord&#39;s ears.&quot; When asked why, he translated and explained its meaning: &quot;The widowed is lonely and has no relatives; the ignorant is ignorant of human affairs; the eyes are blind; the brat is a child.&quot; He was furious and summoned Jun to question him, but he failed to answer him. , slash (cut) its mouth with a hand sword, and dig it with thorns. I didn&#39;t know that it was translated as &quot;foolishness&quot; or &quot;treachery&quot;. So... According to this, Lu Xun is also the ancestor of literal translation. &quot; (&quot;Notes of Rong&#39;an Pavilion&quot; page 146)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jin Xizong Wanyan Dan was the third emperor of the Jin Dynasty. It is said that he studied under Han Fang before he came to the throne and was able to write poems in Chinese. After he came to the throne, he was particularly diligent in studying Chinese classics. According to this article in the &quot;History of the Emperor&quot;, Wanyan Quan did not seem to be very proficient in Chinese, and the translator could only &quot;literally translate&quot;, taking out of context the commonly used imperial edicts. Formulas such as &quot;Gu Zi is ignorant&quot; and &quot;Xiao Yu Xiaozi&quot; can be &quot;directly interpreted&quot; as cursing the Lord, thus losing the original meaning of &quot;retreating, trusting, and rushing&quot;, and Zhang Jun was convicted.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Zhongshu&#39;s note &quot;This is the ancestor of Lu Xun&#39;s literal translation&quot; naturally reminds people of the &quot;Lu-Liang Controversy&quot;. In September 1929, Liang Shiqiu published &quot;On Mr. Lu Xun&#39;s Life&quot; in &quot;Crescent&quot; &quot;Hard Translation&quot;&quot;, Lu Xun refuted it by publishing &quot;&quot;Hard Translation&quot; and &quot;The Class Nature of Literature&quot;&quot; in &quot;Jinya Monthly&quot; in March of the following year. The debate has exceeded the boundaries of translation. As far as translation is concerned, Lu Xun advocated &quot;literal translation&quot; (or &quot;hard translation&quot;), such as the translation of &quot;The Symbol of Depression&quot;, which &quot;is translated sentence by sentence, or even word for word according to the rules&quot;, and its purpose is to &quot;prefer to believe rather than obey.&quot; Qian Zhongshu is obviously familiar with translation However, his views were different from those of Lu Xun, so Qian Zhongshu went on to write:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Yu Reading &quot;Shuowen&quot; to the &quot;Kou&quot; part of the 26th word &quot;囮: 译也&quot;, Chang sighs Ji Chang (Editor&#39;s note: refers to Xu Shen), a true saint, foresees Tradutore, traditore! Wang Yuanzhi&#39;s &quot;Little Animals Collection&quot; Volume 14 &quot;Translation Dui&quot; says: &quot;Translation means Yi. It can change one&#39;s mind if it is big, but it can only change one&#39;s words if it is small. &quot;So on and so forth. After liberation, the trend of translating books became more and more popular. They did not know how to make mistakes, but they were eaten alive. Not only were they changed beyond recognition, but their hearts and minds were completely changed. They were the so-called &quot;great translators&quot; in Xun Yuan Dynasty. Gu Tangsheng&#39;s &quot;Records of Zhang Wenxiang&#39;s Shogunate&quot; Juan Xia said: &quot;Chen Lanbin envoy to the United States, one of his attendants, Xu, is not familiar with Western languages. One day, he suddenly picked up the Western Newspaper and seemed to be reading it with gusto. His colleagues asked him strangely. Xu said: I can&#39;t understand the Western Newspaper. I read Zhu Jun&#39;s translation. Also puzzled. If you still don&#39;t understand, it would be better to just read the Western newspaper. &quot;In this way, both this and Zhang Jun&#39;s incident can be used as the motto of today&#39;s translators. (ibid., pp. 146-147)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This note is related to the fact that &quot;after liberation&quot; the translation industry &quot;does not know what to do. Talking about &quot;eating alive&quot; is also a denial of &quot;literal translation&quot;. Regarding translation, what Qian Zhongshu pursues is the realm of &quot;translation&quot;, although &quot;thorough and complete &#39;translation&#39; is an unattainable ideal.&quot; Therefore, Qian Zhongshu pursues In the article, Zhongshu praised Xu Shen (Jianchang) as a &quot;true saint&quot; and said that he could predict that the translation would be &quot;囮&quot; (false) and that the translator (Tradutore) was a traitor (traditore). For details, see &quot;Lin Shu&#39;s Translation&quot; and There are several discussions in &quot;Guan Zhui Bian&quot;. The following part of this article is based on Gu Hongming&#39;s story of Xu reading a Western newspaper, and combined with Zhang Jun&#39;s view, he believes that &quot;all can be used as the motto of today&#39;s translators.&quot; It is humorous without losing irony, which is quite obvious. Qian Zhongshu&#39;s writing style is consistent. The most eye-catching part of the whole note is the note &quot;the ancestor of literal translation&quot; and so on.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1920s and 1930s, Lin Yutang was trying to change the &quot;Chinese-style humor&quot; &quot;Joking attitude&quot; to reshape the virtues of gentlemen, so he advocated &quot;humorous literature&quot;. Unexpectedly, it backfired, as Qian Zhongshu criticized in his essay &quot;Joking&quot;: &quot;Since the promotion of humorous literature, joking has become a literati career. &quot;Lin Yutang helped the &quot;current ills&quot; by rescuing &quot;current ills.&quot; The actual effect of &quot;humorous literature&quot; ran counter to its original intention. Qian Zhongshu&#39;s &quot;Jokes&quot; was inspired by &quot;humorous literature.&quot; As for Lin Yutang&#39;s ideas, Lu Xun In &quot;One Thought and Action&quot;, he once criticized: &quot;Boom, there is no shortage of humor and sketches in the world. &quot; (&quot;The Complete Works of Lu Xun&quot;, Volume 5, page 473) also pointed out in &quot;Explanation of &quot;Funny&quot;&quot; that humorous literature just gives &quot;slick, frivolous and obscene&quot; the &quot;title of &#39;humor&#39;&quot; (&quot;The Complete Works of Lu Xun&quot;) &quot;Volume 5, page 342). Some people therefore believe that &quot;Lu Xun and Qian Zhongshu really echo each other in their views on promoting humorous literature&quot; (Li Qinye, &quot;Reading &amp;lt;Writing on the Edge of Life&quot;), This statement is specious.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the history of modern literature, Lu Xun, Lin Yutang and Qian Zhongshu are all famous for their humor. Lu Xun&#39;s humor is like a dagger, with the edge of a scalpel to remove tumors, while Lin Yutang&#39;s humor is The breeze is like a purifier for the soul. At that time, Lin Yutang&#39;s humorous literature was naturally not as powerful as Lu Xun&#39;s essays, so it seemed out of date and was publicly criticized by Lu Xun. Qian Zhongshu&#39;s humor was like cold rain hitting his face, cold and thorny, like a pretender The embarrassment and uneasiness after his soul was exposed. However, although Qian Zhongshu also criticized Lin Yutang, if you compare his &quot;Laughing&quot; with Lin Yutang&#39;s &quot;On Humor&quot;, you will find how similar their views on humor are: Qian Zhongshu It is said that a person who is really humorous will have a &quot;knowing smile&quot; about humor. Lin Yutang said that a calm and distant bystander will give a &quot;knowing smile&quot; to humor; Qian Zhongshu said that humor is &quot;funny and wise&quot; , Lin Yutang said, &quot;wisdom has begun&quot; and &quot;there is humor&quot;; Qian Zhongshu said that humor is &quot;a breath of breath for the dull life&quot;, Lin Yutang said that humor is &quot;a part of life&quot;. Humor originates from wisdom, famous humorists It is not surprising that Qian Zhongshu and Lin Yutang have similar concepts but different expressions and effects. Because of this view of humor, Lin Yutang advocates humorous literature to cultivate the people&#39;s sense of humor and cultivate educated citizens, while Qian Zhongshu believes that true humor can &quot; &quot;Anti-bowing and laughing at oneself&quot; will become a laughing stock once advocated, so he said: &quot;Humor is at most a kind of temperament and can never be labeled as an idea, let alone a profession.&quot; ”由此可见，钱锺书与鲁迅虽然都针对林语堂所倡导的“幽默文学”发出批评，但并不能说他们的幽默观一脉相承，反而是钱锺书与林语堂的幽默观“似曾相识”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为同一文艺风气的见证者与参与者，钱锺书虽然与鲁迅不曾有过直接的交往，甚至让人觉得他有时是在刻意“侧目”鲁迅，而沿波讨源，拨开“迷雾”，但凡现代文学史上的重大事件，还是能够同时看到他们的身影，进而看出钱锺书对时贤包括鲁迅一贯的冷漠态度，“好比从飞沙、麦浪、波纹里看出了风的姿态”（钱锺书语）。（本文原题“风的姿态”，现标题为编者所拟）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
